Australia's election at a glance

<TEXT>
	   Some 12 million eligible voters among Australia's population of
18 million will go to the polls Saturday in a national
parliamentary election.
	   Polls are open from 8 a.m.-6 p.m. (In the eastern states, 2200
GMT Friday-0800 GMT Saturday; in the west, 0000-1000 GMT Saturday).
	   The major parties and their leaders and policies are:
	   _Prime Minister John Howard's governing conservative coalition,
composed of his urban-based Liberal Party and the rural National
Party.
	   Howard is running on his management of the economy, growing at
about 3 percent while most of Asia is in recession, and on the need
for tax reform. He wants to introduce a 10 percent goods and
services tax. To sweeten the new tax, Howard linked it to promised
income tax cuts worth 13 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 7.6
billion) a year.
	   _Kim Beazley's Labor Party, which was ousted by Hoard's
conservatives in 1996 after 13 years in power. Beazley is promising
no goods and services tax if his party is elected, and is also
offering more modest income tax cuts targeted at Labor's working
class constituents.
	   Labor has also promised to create 500,000 jobs in its first
three-year term.
	   The conservatives and Labor have been attracting about 43
percent each in neck-and-neck polls throughout the campaign.
	   _Pauline Hanson's new right-wing populist One Nation party,
founded just last year. Hanson warns Australia is being ``swamped''
by Asians and would cut off Asian immigration. She also contends
Aborigines are the most privileged minority in Australia and would
abolish welfare programs for them.
	   One Nation stands no chance of winning government, since it is
polling about 7 percent, but it could tilt the balance of power in
a number of close races for Parliamentary seats.
	   In the 148-seat House of Representatives, where government is
formed, Howard's Liberal Party and the Nationals hold 90 seats, the
Labor Party holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's
Country Liberal Party, 1.
	   Labor would need to win 27 seats to gain government, a feat no
Australian opposition party has ever achieved.
	   Of the 76 Senate seats, 40 will be contested in this election.
	   Howard's government has 37 seats in the senate, Labor 28, the
Australian Democrats 7, the Greens 2 and there are 2 independents.

Toy campaign by McDonald's bowls over Hong Kong

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ For decades, parents around the world have had
to cope with children dragging them to McDonald's restaurants, as
much for the free toys as for the burgers and shakes.
	   But a wildly successful sale of Snoopy toys dressed in the
costumes of different countries has created more than just a steady
flow of children into Hong Kong's 147 McDonald's. It also has
spurred fights, a black market and unusual consumer activism.
	   Though local affection for McDonald's is renowned, and Hong Kong
has proven fertile territory for collectible crazes of all sort,
the Snoopy craze caught many off-guard.
	   McDonald's began the 28-day campaign two weeks ago with
television and print advertisements telling people they could buy a
different Snoopy toy each day for 6 Hong Kong dollars (75 U.S.
cents) with the purchase of a meal.
	   People who wanted to buy all 28 dolls dressed up as everything
from the U.S. costume of Uncle Sam to a Mongolian herdsman had to
buy a meal at McDonald's every day of the promotion.
	   It now seems like almost everyone here is gunning for the
complete set.
	   Black-market collectors are already fetching as much as 200 Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 26) each for the toys. Some travel to
China, where McDonald's are selling Snoopys five at a time, and
resell them in Hong Kong.
	   ``I reckon he's very cute,'' said 28-year old Leonie Tran, a
customer who summed up the sentiments of many of the people who
have spent hours in line to get the dolls.
	   ``Hong Kong people are different. They like collectible
things,'' said Senshu Oishi, 33, a Japanese businesswoman standing
in line outside the McDonald's in the Happy Valley section of Hong
Kong. Oishi has been reselling some of the dolls for inflated
prices.
	   The territory has long been hooked on collectibles.
	   Dozens of local gift shops are devoted exclusively to selling
merchandise featuring cartoon characters such as Mickey Mouse and
Hello Kitty.
	   Earlier this year, a credit card company launched a signature
Hello Kitty credit card that has boosted its client base.
	   News reports about the Snoopy craze _ and what toys can earn on
the black market _ only fueled the frenzy.
	   ``Now it's on TV and some old ladies want to get three or four
pieces and make some money,'' said 29-year-old Stephen Ho, as he
waited to get a Philippines Snoopy for his girlfriend. His only
worry was that his boss would see him waiting on line.
	   The Snoopy promotion, which was meant to provide more order to
McDonald's marketing campaigns in Hong Kong, has ended up creating
controversy.
	   Health advocates have complained that a diet of hamburgers and
fries every day is unhealthy and could get children hooked on
high-fat food.
	   Hong Kong newspapers also have run articles quoting parents and
educators who are complaining that their kids are learning bad
eating habits just to get more Snoopys.
	   McDonald's couldn't say how many Snoopys had been sold or how
much the campaign has boosted sales, but sales usually increase by
5 percent to 10 percent in similar promotions.
	   Sandra Chan, spokeswoman for McDonald's in Hong Kong, said the
company was concerned that the long lines, fights and profiteering
were affecting the ``safety and comfort of customers in the
restaurant.'' So the store recently began offering Snoopy order
forms for the toys to ensure that people could get their favorite
ones after the promotion ends on Oct. 8.
	   But that promise has failed to ease the crowds.
	   The lines doubled in length Thursday, a public holiday for
China's National Day, when a China Snoopy was being offered under
the Golden Arches.

Chinese doctor fails in refugee claim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A Chinese doctor who claims she will be
persecuted in her homeland because of her opposition to the Chinese
government's one-child policy has failed to win refugee status in
Australia on Friday.
	   Justice Brian Tamberlin of the Federal Court dismissed an appeal
by Ye Hong, 32, against a Refugee Review Tribunal decision that she
was not a refugee.
	   Ye told the tribunal she had been detained for two months after
making written complaints in October 1992 about the one-child
policy to the Women's Association of China, the Red Cross and the
Vice-Health Minister in her provincial city.
	   After coming to Australia in 1996 intending to marry, she sent a
written article, critical of the Chinese government, back to China.
	   Tamberlin said Ye, whose relationship with her Australian fiance
ultimately broke down, claimed that ``due to her deep-seated
objections to the one-child policy, she would be likely to repeat
her protests to the authorities.''
	   She believed that this meant they would persecute her if she was
forced to return to China.
	   But in his judgment, Tamberlin said the tribunal found
contradictions in Ye's evidence and had reservations about her
credibility.
	   He said the tribunal was not satisfied that Ye's difficulties
with the Chinese authorities constituted persecution within the
meaning of the international convention on refugees.
	   ``I have considerable doubt as to whether expressions of strong
objection to the one-child policy can be properly described as an
expression of 'a political opinion,''' Tamberlin said.

Manslaughter charges should be laid, coroner's court advised
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ Manslaughter charges should be laid
against the skipper of the boat that took American divers Thomas
and Eileen Lonergan to the Great Barrier Reef and allegedly left
them there, the lawyer for the Cairns Coroners Court aid Friday.
	   John Bailey, counsel assisting coroner Noel Nunan, said he would
submit that Geoff (Jack) Nairn, the managing director of dive
company Outer Edge, had unlawfully killed Lonergan, 33, and his
28-year-old wife.
	   The Lonergans, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were last seen on Jan.
25.
	   The inquest, which sat for five days last month, has been told
they were accidentally left behind when the dive boat Outer Edge
returned from St. Crispin Reef, 43 miles (70 km) northeast of Port
Douglas.
	   Bailey said Nairn had breached an obligation to ensure the
safety of the Lonergans.
	   Rob Davis, speaking for the Lonergan family, also submitted it
was the legal duty of Nairn to ensure the safety of the Lonergans.
	   Nairn exercised his right to silence. The hearing is continuing.

Taiwan scraps military display to build atmosphere for China talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Seeking to sweeten the atmosphere for
talks with China, Taiwan on Friday canceled a large military
display that had been scheduled just before a top envoy's visit to
Beijing.
	   The staging of the event was ``not appropriate at this time,''
Armed Forces Commander in Chief Tang Fei told reporters after a
rehearsal for the live fire display, designed to show off a new
weapons system.
	   By canceling the display, originally scheduled for Oct. 12 in
southern Pingtung county, Taiwan hopes to set the stage for
``pleasant relations between the sides'' and avoid ``unnecessary
misunderstanding and difficulties,'' Tang said.
	   He said the decision to cancel was made after he suggested it to
Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui.
	   The Defense Ministry's spokesman's office said there were no
immediate plans to reschedule the display. A second rehearsal
scheduled for Oct. 7 was also canceled.
	   Koo Chen-fu, an elderly advisor who is Lee's top negotiator with
China, is to make a watershed visit to China beginning Oct. 14.
	   His trip marks the highest level contact between the sides since
Beijing broke off talks in 1995 in anger over Taiwan's drive for
greater international recognition. Taiwan hopes his informal
meetings with Chinese officials will pave the way for a formal
restoration of dialogue.
	   Taiwan and China divided politically amid civil war in 1949, and
China continues to claim the island as a renegade province.
Beijing's threat to use force if necessary to reunify with the
island prompts Taiwan to allocate huge defense budgets.
	   The timing of military exercises by either side has been the
subject on intense scrutiny since China staged threatening war
games during Taiwan's presidential elections in 1996.
	   Military exercises staged by Taiwan during Hong Kong's reversion
to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, were widely considered a message
to the world that Taiwan would determine its own fate.

Will Pauline Hanson's departure be as meteoric as her arrival?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The right-wing One Nation party's
populist leader Pauline Hanson boasts she is no politician, but she
has dominated Australian politics since her inaugural speech in
Parliament in 1996.
	   Three years ago, she was a restaurant owner educated at
Brisbane's working-class Cooparoo High School who had cut her
political teeth with an inconspicuous two-year stint as an Ipswich
city council member.
	   In the last year, the 44-year-old divorced mother of two emerged
as a plausible challenge to the Australian Democrats' hold on the
balance of power in the upper house of Parliament and a threat to
the rural conservative National Party's survival.
	   But during this campaign, her party's poll ratings have stayed
stuck at about 7 percent in most parts of the nation, or even
declined, and Hanson is in a too-close-to-call race to keep her own
Parliamentary seat.
	   During her meteoric rise, she has been written off as a spent
political force and held up by Foreign Minister Alexander Downer as
a menacing prospect as a prime minister.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad described her as ``a
little bit moronic'' and Education Minister Amanda Vanstone called
her a boring woman who hates the world and has an ego bigger than
Texas.
	   But her extraordinary capacity to attract hate and derision has
enhanced her role as a non-politician in charge of a political
party.
	   Ironically, the very issue that fueled her unprecedented rise
from obscurity may prove her political undoing.
	   In a strident speech to Parliament after winning an upset
victory as an independent in 1996 elections, Hanson warned
Australia was in danger of being swamped by Asians and called for
the scrapping of Aboriginal welfare programs.
	   Prime Minister John Howard declared her a comet that would burn
out within three months _ but she didn't.
	   Last year, when a videotape which Hanson said was made for
broadcast to her fellow Australians in the event of her murder
became public, it was widely dismissed as a bizarre political stunt
of a spent political force.
	   She broke down during a television interview, saying she and her
two daughters had moved to a secret address following death
threats.
	   However, One Nation was resurrected as a serious political
player last June when the party attracted a quarter of the
Queensland election votes and bagged 11 seats of 89 seats in the
state Parliament.

Philippine Airlines workers finish voting on airline's future
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Government officials began counting
the results Friday of a referendum by Philippine Airlines employees
on whether they will accept a management recovery plan that would
allow Asia's oldest carrier to reopen.
	   Under the plan, workers would accept a 10-year suspension of
their collective bargaining agreement in exchange for 20 percent of
the company's stock and seats on its board.
	   It was the second time that the 6,700 members of PAL's largest
union have voted on the rescue plan. Last week, they rejected the
proposal, forcing the airline to shut down and leaving much of the
country without air service.
	   President Joseph Estrada said turnout was heavy at PAL regional
offices. Last week, less than half of the workers voted.
	   Asked whether he thought the results of the referendum would
allow PAL to fly again by next Wednesday, Estrada replied, ``I
believe so.''
	   He assured workers that he will defend their rights during the
10-year CBA suspension.
	   ``I'm willing to protect them at all costs. That I can assure
them, they have nothing to fear,'' he said.
	   On Thursday, PAL chairman and chief stockholder Lucio Tan asked
all of the airline's executives to submit resignations so that any
new investors could have a free hand in the company's management.
	   PAL has been ravaged by strikes and Asia's currency crisis. It
says creditors and investors have insisted on a suspension of the
union's bargaining agreement to ensure labor harmony before they
accept a restructuring of the company's finances.
	   Many union members had believed the government would not allow
the 57-year-old flag carrier to close. But when government-enlisted
foreign carriers began flying some domestic routes on Monday, union
leaders reversed their position and agreed to accept the management
plan.
	   The agreement must be formally endorsed by workers, regulators
and PAL's creditors.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with militant
members saying a suspension of the bargaining agreement would
violate workers' rights.
	   Estrada says the government cannot take over the airline because
it does not have enough money to pay for its daily losses of up to
45 million pesos (dlrs 1 million).
	   Asia's currency crisis hit shortly after PAL launched a dlrs 4
billion modernization program, greatly inflating the amount of
money it must repay to overseas creditors. The airline has been
unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of debt.
	   Two foreign carriers, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific and Dragon
Airlines, have begun flying some domestic routes to help fill the
vacuum left by PAL's closure.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Czech defender Lubos Kubik scored on a penalty
shot, and the Chicago Fire beat the Colorado Rapids 2-1 in a
shootout to take a 1-0 lead in their MLS Western Conference
semifinal series Thursday night.
	   The Fire can wrap up the best-of-3 series Monday night at
Colorado. Game 3, if necessary, would be Wednesday night in
Chicago.
	   Chicago won the shootout 3-2, with Tom Soehn, Frank Klopas and
Jesse Marsch converting their chances. Marsch had the clinching
goal in the sixth round, and goalie Zach Thornton stopped the
Rapids' three final shots.
	   Kubik, a 1990 World Cup player, beat Marcus Hahnemann on a
penalty shot in the 50th minute. Chicago's Peter Nowak was fouled
in the box by Colorado's Steve Trittschuh.
	   Chicago had a chance to put the game away in the final 20
minutes, but forwards Ante Razov and Josh Wolff both sent shots
wide right with Hahnemann out of position.
	   Colorado's Waldir tied at 1 in the 79th minute.
 &UR; Galaxy 6, Burn 1
	   In Pasadena, California, Carlos Hermosillo scored two of Los
Angeles' five first-half goals as the Galaxy routed the Dallas Burn
6-1 on Thursday night in the most one-sided playoff game in MLS
history.
	   Los Angeles, the Western Conference regular-season champion,
took a 1-0 lead in the best-of-3 conference semifinal series. Game
2 is Sunday at Dallas. Game 3, if necessary, is set for Wednesday
night at the Rose Bowl.
	   Hermosillo, who had 275 goals in 457 games in Mexico's First
Division and six in 18 MLS regular-season games, scored off Steve
Jolley's pass in the 16th minute, and capitalized on Welton's feed
in the 32nd minute. Hermosillo also assisted on Welton's goal in
the 41st minute.
	   Danny Pena, a defender who failed to score during the regular
season, also had two goals, and Mauricio Cienfuegos added a goal.
Martin Machon had an MLS-playoff record three assists. Los Angeles
set playoff records for goals in a half and game, and also had a
record nine assists.
	   Dante Washington scored for Dallas in the 47th minute.

 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election
 &UR; By ANDREW TROUNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ On the eve of a close election,
Prime Minister John Howard unveiled a 100 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 58 million) relief fund Friday to help those
worst hit by a natural gas shortage caused by a refinery explosion.
	   ``Its conjunction with the federal election campaign is a matter
of sheer coincidence,'' Howard said.
	   Howard said the fund would be used to pay workers laid off as a
result of the gas shutdown, help the elderly and sick and offset
the cost to business of converting to non-gas energy in Victoria
state.
	   A fire at Esso's Longford gas refinery Sept. 25 killed two men
and injured eight.
	   The plant supplied more than 80 percent of the natural gas for
Australia's second-most populous state, and some 1.4 million
households and 100,000 businesses may be without it for at least
two weeks.
	   Industry will get priority over households once Victoria's gas
supply resumes flowing to enable people to get back to work, state
Premier Jeff Kennett said Thursday.
	   ``If it's going to take a few days to get it back on totally
when it starts flowing, is it better to have people employed or is
it better for domestic users to have access to the gas?'' he said.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold showers
and looking for electric griddles and frying pans to cook their
food. Many industries have had to suspend operations; funeral homes
have turned to bottled gas in order to keep crematoriums operating.
	   Those people lucky enough to have electric hot water heaters are

so people can shower there _ a relief as sweaty Victorians swelter
in a heat wave that hit 89 degrees (32 Celsius) Thursday.
	   Locked in a neck-and-neck electoral race with the Labor
opposition for Saturday's national election, the conservative prime
minister announced funding for the crisis Friday.

bakeries, dairies and many other industries shut down.
	   Some people have tried to prevent gas workers from cutting off
their service by chaining vicious dogs to their gas meters, but
they have been thwarted by being shut off from the street main

Australia's election at a glance

 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Some 12 million eligible voters among Australia's population of
18 million will go to the polls Saturday in a national election for
both houses of the country's bicameral Parliament.
	   Polls are open from 8 a.m.-6 p.m. local time (which in
Australia's eastern time zone is 2200 GMT Friday-0800 GMT Saturday
and in the west is 0000-1000 GMT Saturday).
	   The major parties and their leaders and policies are:
	   _Prime Minister John Howard's governing conservative coalition,
composed of his urban-based Liberal Party and the rural National
Party.
	   Howard is running on his management of the economy, growing at
about 3 percent while most of Asia is in recession, and on the need
for tax reform. He wants to introduce a 10-percent goods and
services tax. To sweeten the new tax, Howard linked it to promised
income tax cuts worth 13 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 7.6
billion) a year.
	   _Kim Beazley's Labor Party, which was ousted by Howard's
conservatives in 1996 after 13 years in power. Beazley is promising
no goods and services tax if his party is elected and is also
offering more modest income tax cuts targeted at Labor's working
class constituents.
	   Labor has also promised to create 500,000 jobs in its first
three-year term.
	   The conservatives and Labor are running neck-and-neck, each
attracting about 43 percent of voters in polls throughout the
campaign.
	   _Pauline Hanson's new right-wing populist One Nation party,
founded just last year. Hanson warns Australia is being ``swamped''
by Asians and would cut off Asian immigration. She also contends
Aborigines are the most privileged minority in Australia and would
abolish welfare programs for them.
	   One Nation stands no chance of winning government, since it is
polling about 7 percent, but it could tilt the balance of power in
a number of close races for Parliamentary seats.
	   In the 148-seat House of Representatives, where prime ministers
are chosen, Howard's Liberal Party and the Nationals hold 90 seats,
the Labor Party holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern
Territory's Country Liberal Party one.
	   Labor would need to win 27 seats to gain government.
	   Of the 76 Senate seats, 40 will be contested in this election.
	   Howard's government has 37 seats in the Senate, Labor 28, the
Australian Democrats seven and the Greens two. There are two
independents.

Fish workers stop fishing, plant mangroves for World Fishing Day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - Traditional Indian coastal
fishermen, fighting to prevent foreign trawlers from decimating
fish stocks, have won support from eight other countries only a
year after they sought offshore help in their struggle, their
representative said Friday.
	   Xavier Pinto, of the Indian National Fishworkers Forum, expects
groups in all nine countries to take positive action on World
Fisheries Day, Nov. 21, against trawler fishing which he says is
destroying world fish stocks.
	   ``We believe we are gathering momentum, and we expect people
will begin to understand the issues better'' as more groups join
the movement, Pinto told The Associated Press.
	   India's 800,000 traditional fish workers have declared the day a
fishing holiday, and along with groups in Malaysia and Sri Lanka,
will plant coastal mangrove areas to improve breeding grounds.
	   Pinto said the Indian fish workers' struggle began in response
to a government plan to issue more than 2,600 trawler licenses to
foreign fishing companies. The number was reduced to 33 licenses
after a four-year protest campaign.
	   ``We rely on fishing for our sustenance and our livelihood. Yet
the industrial trawlers cut our nets and even shoot at our people,
We've had six injured in shooting incidents.
	   ``Our fight is to ban industrial fishing, foreign industrial
trawlers, coastal pollution and fishery destruction,'' he said.
	   Industrial trawlers rob fishing communities of their livelihood
around the world, he said.
	   Pinto said the latest coastal threat in India was a move by
British shipper P and O to build a 30-berth container ``mega-port''
at Wadhwan, only 75 miles (120 km) north of the port of Bombay,
costing U.S. dlrs 15 billion.
	   ``The homes of 2,300 fisher people will be destroyed for this
shipyard, yet there is already a port only 120 kilometers away. It
will take 240,000 acres of land (100,000 hectares), half of it
(currently) in rain forest.''
	   The fight to halt the port would be taken to the British
Parliament and directly to the company, he said.
	   Industrial trawlers, as well as fishing out stocks, were causing
pollution in breeding grounds.
	   ``Our fisher-people work for the preservation and conservation
of the oceans. In India, we are also planting mangrove forests in
estuaries to strengthen breeding grounds.''
	   He said together with national groups in South Africa, Senegal,
Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Malaysia,
India's fish workers' forum has linked with Greenpeace
International, which has the same aim of a global ban on industrial
trawlers.
	   ``While India is leading this struggle, so many others believe
it's possible for these fleets to be stopped.
	   ``Traditional fishermen know the future will live on what is
left behind,'' said Pinto.
	   Almost two-thirds of the world's 200 commercially important fish
stocks are either overexploited or fished to nearly the limit, the
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization reported in 1997.
	   National Fishworkers Forum Indian president, Thomas Kocherry,
said last year that 75 percent of the world's fisheries were on the
verge of collapse due to irresponsible fishing practices.

Cambodian economy hurt by continuing political instability
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Hopes for a post-election recovery
by Cambodia's struggling economy are being dashed by continuing
political instability, according to a report released by an
independent research institute on Friday.
	   The wide-ranging survey of business and labor found a host of
problems: commerce has slowed, prices of staples such as rice are
rising, consumer confidence has continued to languish and
businesses are cutting wages and staff.
	   The survey was conducted in August by the Cambodian Development
Resource Institute and published in its monthly bulletin.
	   After almost two decades of war and failed experiments with
Marxism, Cambodia's shattered economy showed modest signs of
recovering after United Nations-sponsored elections in 1993
produced a coalition government.
	   But those gains were lost after co-Prime Minister Hun Sen
deposed his counterpart Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a bloody coup
d'etat in 1997, the report said.
	   The political violence and instability paralyzed economic
growth, foreign investment and aid.
	   On July 26, Cambodians voted in a national election that many
hoped would end the bitter rivalry between Hun Sen and Ranariddh.
	   But the results only brought new strife.
	   Hun Sen's party won 64 of 122 seats in parliament, too few to
form his own government but enough to bring allegations of election
fraud by the opposition.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk brought Hun Sen and his opponents to the
negotiating table last month, but talks on setting up a coalition
government have proceeded slowly.
	   Meanwhile, the economy has continued to deteriorate.
	   Market vendors told CDRI that sales are still 48 percent lower
than they were before the coup. Inflation for the year was
estimated at 13 percent, with food prices skyrocketing during and
after the election, the report said.
	   The price of rice, the staple of the Cambodian diet, had risen
27 percent compared to a year ago.
	   Most large businesses, especially in the tourism sector,
reported reductions in staff and salaries. Tourist arrivals are
down 50 percent for the year, and hotel occupancy rates are down
between 10 and 20 percent.
	   The lone exception was Cambodia's garment industry. The survey
found that factories exported dlrs 140.5 million of garments in the
first half of 1998, a 63 percent increase from a year ago.
	   While the report said other factors have contributed to the
economic downturn, including drought and the regional economic
crisis, it placed most the blame on political unrest.
	   ``Having predicted in earlier surveys that things would improve
after the election, vendors were unexpectedly somber in their
assessment of future prospects,'' CDRI stated.
	   The report said that an improvement of the political situation
would likely inspire investor confidence, boost tourism and allow
for an inflow of foreign assistance that was drastically slashed
after Ranariddh's ouster.
	   Cambodian economist Bith Seanglim disagreed with the report's
analysis, arguing that the Southeast Asian economic slowdown that
began last year and the recent overall drop in global markets were
larger factors in the economic slowdown.
	   ``As a whole, regional factors have more of a negative effect,''
he said.

Sakura Bank discussing business ties with Deutsche Bank, Kokusai

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sakura Bank Ltd. said Friday it is discussing a
possible joint venture with Germany's Deutsche Bank AG to manage
mutual funds, the latest large Japanese bank to look abroad for
help in weathering deregulation at home.
	   Sakura said, however, that the tie-up with Deutsche Bank is just
one option and no concrete decision has been made.
	   Sakura also wants mid-sized Japanese brokerage Kokusai
Securities Co. to join the venture, Kyodo News reported.
	   Japanese banks have been scrambling to sharpen their asset
management skills as the country's ``Big Bang'' deregulation drive
brings greater competition between banks, brokerages and fund
managers.
	   On Thursday, Wall Street investment bank J.P. Morgan and Co. and
one of Japan's largest lenders, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., said
Thursday they will set up a Tokyo-based company to manage
investment trusts _ Japan's version of mutual funds.
	   A Kokusai spokesman said that the brokerage house has been
developing close ties with Deutsche Bank.

Thailand asking the US to extradite two finance executives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ He was once considered the whiz kid of
Thailand's financial community. Now he's a fugitive from justice.
	   Thailand's Foreign Ministry said on Friday that it is planning
to ask the United States to extradite Pin Chakkapak, former
president of Finance One, a failed finance company that was once
the most successful in Thailand.
	   The ministry will also ask for the extradition of Termchai
Pinyawat, the company's former managing director, said ministry
spokesman Kobsak Chutikul.
	   Thailand's central bank has filed criminal charges of financial
wrongdoing against the two, along with another executive from the
company.
	   The government has received reports that Pin and Termchai fled
to the United States several months ago but has not been able to
confirm their exact whereabouts.
	   They are accused of violating the Credit Foncier Act by
approving loans for 2.1 billion baht (dlrs 53.2 million) without
collateral to loss-ridden companies, driving Finance One into
bankruptcy.
	   Reckless lending, sometimes to business cronies and politicians,
contributed to a crisis in Thailand's financial sector that led to
the closing of 56 of the country's 93 finance companies by the
government earlier this year.
	   The crumbling of Thailand's financial sector helped trigger the
regional economic meltdown that began in 1997. The effects are
still being felt as far away as Russia and South America as
investor confidence in emerging markets continues to plummet.
	   Pin was once known as Thailand's Takeover King for the bold
maneuverings that propelled his company to the forefront of the
industry as Thailand's economy boomed in the early 1990s.
	   If Thailand wants U.S. authorities to extradite Pin and
Termchai, it must produce evidence of their wrongdoing within 60
days of making the request, Kobsak said.
	   He said it was not certain when the ministry would formally make
the request.
	   Authorities from the Finance and Foreign Ministries and the
central bank plan to meet in the near future to discuss means to
bring the two executives back before asking the United States to
extradite them, he said.

Dispute over French-only store signs fuels tension in Quebec
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Police investigate bomb threats. Rival protesters
scream epithets at their foes. Quebec's premier intercedes,
describing the situation as explosive. The reason for the furor:
French-only signs in Montreal department stores.
	   For years, major retailers in Montreal _ one of the world's most
bilingual cities _ have displayed signs in French only, even though
a 1993 law allowed them to add English wording as long as the
French predominated.
	   That practice caused little fuss _ until last week. Militants
from an English-rights organization called Alliance Quebec began
picketing one of the stores, Eaton's, demanding that English be
added to its signs.
	   The picketing, conducted for several days, prompted
counter-protests by militant French-speaking separatists.
Obscenities were shouted, eggs were hurled, some protesters tried
to overrun barricades set up by police to keep the two sides apart.
	   By Monday, management of Eaton's and three other
department-store chains said they were ready to bow to the Alliance
Quebec demands. But on Thursday, Quebec's separatist premier,
Lucien Bouchard, interceded, summoning the store's executives to a
meeting and pleading with them to retain the French-only sign
policy.
	   ``I am just trying to behave like a premier and deal with a very
explosive situation,'' Bouchard said after the evening meeting.
	   ``Our linguistic situation is unique in the world ... we should
all be very careful before changing anything in terms of what we
have achieved in stability.''
	   Bouchard's position is awkward. He recently fended off a move by
hard-liners within his Parti Quebecois to toughen the language law
so that bilingual signs would not even be a legal option for
stores.
	   The store executives were cautious after Thursday's meeting,
saying they would reassess their sign policies on a store-by-store
basis, trying to gauge what best suited their customers' wishes.
	   Bouchard would not say what he would do if the stores rebuffed
his request and went ahead with plans for more English on signs.
	   The dispute _ the latest in a long line of language
controversies in Montreal _ has inflamed passions. Police were kept
busy Thursday checking out bomb threats made to a number of
downtown department stores, and another bomb threat prompted
evacuation of the Alliance Quebec office.
	   Jean Charest, head of the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party,
accused the Parti Quebecois of exploiting the sign dispute to stir
up emotions in advance of a crucial provincial election.
	   Bouchard, who stands almost even with Charest in the polls, is
expected to call the election either late this year or next spring.
If the Parti Quebecois is re-elected, Bouchard is expected to hold
a referendum on secession from Canada at any point where opinion
polls indicate a breakaway attempt would get majority support.
	   About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.3 million people are
French-speaking. About 200,000 English-speakers have left the
province since the Parti Quebecois was first elected in 1976.

Land-scarce Singapore to put 15-year time limit on burials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Land-scarce Singapore will begin recycling
burial sites next month as graveyard space disappears in the tiny
city-state, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The Environment Ministry has imposed a 15-year limit on burials
at Singapore's largest cemetery, after which the remains are either
cremated or re-buried in smaller plots, according to The Straits
Times.
	   Located in the western part of Singapore, Chao Chu Kang cemetery
will soon be the densely-populated island republic's only
graveyard, as other burial sites are cleared for development.
	   The cemetery is already about three-quarters full, and officials
expect to run out of room there in about 15 years if no action is
taken, reported the newspaper.
	   ``If we do not plan now, the problem of limited cemetery space
will become insurmountable in the future,'' Public Health
Commissioner Daniel Wang was quoted as saying. ``This is not
something we like to do, but it is inevitable.''
	   The government is suggesting cremation as an alternative to
burial and will enforce that practice after the 15-year limit for
most cases.
	   But remains of people from religions that require burial _ such
as Muslims and Jews _ will be re-interred in smaller plots, the
report added.

Cambodian king will delay trip to China to visit Phnom Penh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk has delayed
plans to leave Cambodia for medical treatment in Beijing and will
instead fly to Phnom Penh next week, a government spokesman said
Friday.
	   A letter released by the Royal Palace confirmed that Sihanouk
and Queen Monineath will leave his residence in the northwestern
city of Siem Reap and arrive in Phnom Penh on Monday.
	   Diplomats in Phnom Penh said the king's trip to the capital is
probably intended to spur Cambodia's politicians to hasten the pace
of negotiations over forming a new working government.
	   Sihanouk's arrivals and departures from Cambodia are often seen
as a barometer of his opinion of the political situation, which has
been frequently wracked by violence.
	   Palace sources reported this week that the king would fly to
Beijing on Monday to receive medical treatment from his Chinese
doctors.
	   The 75-year-old monarch suffers from a variety of illnesses. He
was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1993, but it has since gone into
remission.
	   Sihanouk's mediating efforts helped bring Cambodia's bitterly
divided political factions to the bargaining table last month after
street clashes broke out in Phnom Penh over the results of the July
26 national election.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won a majority in
the election, claiming 64 of the 122 seats in parliament but not
the two-thirds needed to form the government alone.
	   Opposition parties led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the king's
son, and former Finance Minister Sam Rainsy have claimed that Hun
Sen's victory was achieved through fraud and intimidation.
	   The two parties, winners of 58 seats in the National Assembly,
have resisted forming a coalition government with the ruling party
until their allegations are thoroughly investigated.
	   A series of negotiations by the three parties began Tuesday to
select leadership positions in parliament and form a new
government. Progress in the talks, however, has been slow.
	   A Western diplomat said Friday that the king's trip to the
capital could be interpreted as a signal to the opposition to come
to an agreement with Hun Sen soon so parliament can convene.
	   The king has returned to Cambodia twice since Ranariddh was
ousted from his post as co-prime minister by Hun Sen last year in a
bloody coup d'etat.
	   However, the king has attempted to remain mostly above the
political fray, spending the vast majority of his stays at his
residence in Siem Reap rather than at the Royal Palace in Phnom
Penh.

U.N. Security Council condemns massacre in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council has condemned the
recent massacres of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, but has not
assigned blame and added no new legal backing for any NATO action
in the southern Serb province.
	   The council issued a statement Thursday, hoping to increase
pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to stop the
crackdown on ethnic Albanians, who are seeking independence for
Kosovo. The province is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   Attempting to head off threatened NATO attacks, Yugoslavia's
Serb leadership offered on Thursday to let foreign experts
investigate the massacres _ a key demand of the council.
	   But it wasn't clear if the gesture would be enough. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright declared that NATO ``is now prepared to
act'' militarily against Serbian positions after briefing nearly
the entire U.S. Senate on the escalating tensions.
	   The international outrage was sparked after diplomats,
journalists and human rights workers reported seeing as many as 18
mutilated bodies in the forests around the Kosovo town of Obrija
earlier this week. Residents in the nearby town of Golubovac
reported that Serb forces surrounded a group of refugees on
Saturday, separated 13 men and shot them.
	   The Serbs have denied involvement in the massacres. Serb Deputy
Premier Vojislav Seselj claimed on Thursday that Western nations
staged the massacre ``to push through ... a NATO attack decision in
the U.N. Security Council.''
	   Serbian security forces are trying to crush ethnic Albanian
separatists in Kosovo. Hundreds have been killed and an estimated
275,000 people have been driven from their homes since the
crackdown began in February.
	   The council expressed ``considerable alarm'' that fighting was
continuing despite a U.N. demand last week for a cease-fire _ but
did not single out the Serbs.
	   Council members ``strongly condemned those responsible for the
atrocities and called upon President Milosevic and the government
in Belgrade immediately to investigate and identify and punish
those responsible,'' council president Jeremy Greenstock of Britain
said.
	   In discussions with council members Thursday, Russia and China
said they wanted more information on the massacres before assigning
blame to the Serbs, diplomats said.
	   The United States praised the council's declaration.
	   ``I think it's a very clear, direct message to the government in
Belgrade that they have to be accountable and responsible for their
activities,'' said deputy U.S. ambassador Peter Burleigh.
	   The council called for the U.N. tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia to investigate possible violations of humanitarian law
in Kosovo and asked the U.N. chief to speed up a report on the
situation there.
	   Diplomats were to hear Friday from the tribunal president, Judge
Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States, who has urged the
council to ensure Yugoslav authorities cooperate in bringing war
crimes suspects from the Bosnian war to justice.
	   On Monday, the council was to receive Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's report on Kosovo, in which he was expected to detail
whether both sides had heeded the council's call for a cease-fire
and a negotiated settlement.
	   NATO ambassadors have said they will not make any decision on
ordering military strikes before receiving the U.N. chief's report.
The group's decision-making body, however, took another step
Thursday to prepare airstrikes against Serb forces.
	   The North Atlantic Council approved an ``activation request''
for the 16-member alliance to formally commit warplanes and other
forces for an eventual air campaign, diplomats said. Potential
targets include police camps in Pristina, Pec, Kosovska Mitrovica,
Djakovica, Prizren and Urosevac.
	   Russia and China have flatly rejected the use of force to end
the conflict. As permanent council members, they could veto any new
resolution authorizing military action.
	   The United States has said it believes that prior U.N.
resolutions authorize NATO action and no new resolution is needed.

Highly organized evacuation procedures saved lives in Cuba
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUANTANAMO, Cuba (AP) _ Eneida didn't want to leave her home in
the lowlands, even though Hurricane Georges was headed straight for
her town in easternmost Cuba.
	   But when the young police officer got tough with her last week _
threatening a fine if she didn't leave _ the woman agreed to go
with him to a government shelter, joining about a half million
evacuees nationwide.
	   By the next morning, her house was submerged.
	   The initial defiance of Eneida, whose story was recounted by
Guantanamo's weekly newspaper Venceremos, was unusual in communist
Cuba.
	   People here are instructed from an early age how to move quickly
in the event of a natural disaster _ or military attack. That's
especially true in Guantanamo, which has been hit by numerous
hurricanes over the years and is home to a U.S. Naval base that
remains a thorn in the side of the Cuban government.
	   A more typical example was Maria del Carmen Garcia, who readily
obeyed orders to abandon her home by the Yaya River. Within hours,
the river was transformed from a dry creekbed into a raging muddy
surge. It smashed into the wooden house on stilts, destroying its
rustic bathroom and carrying away much of her furniture.
	   ``Every single Cuban is a part of the civil defense network,
whether in time of war or time of natural emergency,'' the
40-year-old internist said, walking through the house that had
parts of its soaked wooden walls ripped away by the river's
torrents. ``You just do it because you realize your life is more
important than mere things that can be replaced.''
	   President Fidel Castro credited his country's sophisticated
civil defense program earlier this week with the limited loss of
life to the storm.
	   Just five people died in Cuba, compared with around 300 combined
in Haiti and the Dominican Republic _ the freer but more chaotic
countries that share the neighboring island of Hispaniola.
	   Rolando Rodriguez, vice president of Guantanamo province and
president of evacuation measures for the entire region, credited
the government's four-phase program for natural disasters for
saving people's lives.
	   The first informative phase went into effect two days before
Georges struck, offering frequent announcements on
government-controlled radio and television that the hurricane was
likely to hit.
	   The second alert phase took effect one day later, informing
citizens that a hurricane hit was probable and to prepare for
possible evacuation.
	   Within hours, the third phase _ alarm _ was called and the
evacuations began.
	   Rodriguez had all the vehicles in the province _ buses, farm
trucks, taxis _ put at his disposal to quickly transport people
from danger areas to schools and other buildings in higher
territory. Since virtually all the vehicles in Cuba are
government-owned, taking possession of them would not be difficult.
	   Meanwhile, citizens serving on civil defense committees _
organized by community, by neighborhood, even by block _ went into
high gear, ensuring that each shelter was properly stocked with
food, water, blankets and other supplies.
	   Civil defense workers went from house to house in their
neighborhoods, ensuring that everyone got out in time.
	   They were helped by leaders of the Committees for the Defense of
the Revolution, a kind of ideological neighborhood watch group that
keeps tabs on every single person on every single street block in
Cuba.
	   Even though these committees are often criticized as political
busybodies and tattletales, there appeared to be genuine
appreciation among ordinary Cubans this week at the fact that at
least when it came to natural disaster mitigation, their system
worked.
	   The similarly organized Defense Councils are also prepared to
sound a multiphase alert in the event of a military attack _
something that remains a real fear among many Cubans because of the
country's longstanding adversarial relationship with the United
States.
	   In the case of Hurricane Georges, the neighborhood watch
committees helped ensure the safe evacuation of two blind, elderly
women who were home alone and unaware of the storm's approach,
Rodriguez said.
	   ``We evacuated 47,000 people and not one person died in our
province,'' he said. ``The long-existing organizational structures
that we have in Cuba are what helped.''

Markets in Asia dip on concern over Wall Street's losing streak
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Many Asian markets drifted lower on Friday as
cautious investors withdrew funds from regional bourses following a
second day of more than 200 point losses on Wall Street's key stock
index.
	   Taking a cue from the downturn in shares traded in New York,
equity markets all around the Pacific rim _ from New Zealand to
Singapore _ opened lower amid growing concern over the possibility
of a worldwide economic slump.
	   New Zealand's NZSE-40 capital index lost 26.30 points to close
at 1668.24 _ its second straight day at a five-year low.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index fell 11.05 points, or 1.2
percent, to 904.97 in early trading on global recession fears
triggered by the Dow Jones industrial average's two-day tumble,
traders said.
	   The Dow, which plunged 237.90 points on Wednesday, suffered an
additional 210.09 point loss _ a decline of 2.7 percent _ to close
Thursday at 7,632.53.
	   The selling spree, sparked by worries about shrinking corporate
profits and fears of new financial crises, left the Dow 18.3
percent, or more than 1,700 points, below the all-time high of
9,337.97 reached on July 17.
	   The closely-watched stock average slid 12.4 percent in the third
quarter, which ended Wednesday _ its worst quarterly performance in
eight years. The Dow is now 3.5 percent below where it began this
year.
	   Sinking stock prices in New York have kindled doubts about the
ability of top-flight Asian manufacturers to rely on strong sales
in the United States to keep their factories humming amid a
prolonged slump in their home markets.
	   In South Korea, the Composite Stock Price Index shed 2.56 points
to 303.08 just after the start of trading.
	   ``The market is falling again on the overall stock fall in many
other countries Thursday, raising jitters over world financial
instability,'' said Yun Sam-wee, an analyst at LG Securities Co. in
Seoul.
	   Led by shares of blue chip exporters, Japan's benchmark Nikkei
Stock Average dipped below 13,000 for the first time since January
of 1986 before recovering to close up 26.57 points, or 0.20
percent, to 13,223.69.
	   In Australia, the All Ordinaries stock index was down 40.3
points to 2528.9 as of midday. Bank shares led the market lower
following the decline in financial shares traded overnight in New
York, but this was partially offset by a rise in mining stocks on
higher gold prices, traders said.
	   Bourses in Manila and Taipei were similarly hit hard Friday
after sharp declines in the previous day's trading. The 30-share
Philippine Stock Exchange Index lost 31.70 points, or 2.6 percent,
to close the week at 1195.62.
	   In Taiwan, the Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange
plunged 266.06 points, or 4 percent, to end at 6346.00. Wall Street
worries combined with concern over reports a local transportation
conglomerate was unable to meet its payment obligations, traders
said.
	   Indonesia's JSX Composite Index also headed lower in early
trading, losing 3.72 points, or 1.3 percent, to 270,152.
	   Hong Kong and Shanghai financial markets were closed Friday to
celebrate China's National Day holiday.

Efforts of Greenspan, Rubin to shore up shaky markets not working

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Top financial officials of the United States
and other countries are a blur of activity these days, constantly
waging their attack on the global economic crisis _ promising to
stand by Brazil, jawboning U.S. investment houses to bail out a
major hedge fund and dreaming up ways to overhaul the globe's
financial architecture.
	   All this activity is designed to instill confidence in badly
shaken world markets. The only trouble is that so far the effort
isn't working.
	   The United States had its two economic superstars _ Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
_ out on the stump Thursday, and the market still plunged.
	   The Dow Jones average suffered its second straight loss of more
than 200 points as investors fretted about whether other U.S. hedge
funds could fail and worried about news indicating Japan is still
mired in its worst recession in 50 years.
	   The market was falling as Rubin was telling investors gathered
in a New York hotel that the United States will use international
financial meetings that begin Saturday to press for reforms in the
global financial system, including the International Monetary Fund.
	   The 182-nation IMF has been widely criticized for its handling
of the crisis that began in Asia 15 months ago, has now spread to
Russia and is threatening Latin America.
	   President Bill Clinton, appearing at a Democratic fund-raiser in
Washington late Thursday, urged continued U.S. support for the IMF
despite Republican criticism, saying a stable international economy
was key to prosperity for Americans.
	   ``If the American people like this economic recovery we have,
and they want it to go on, then we must recognize that 30 percent
of it came from trade, and our ability to be strong and to lead the
world depends upon our doing our part,'' Clinton said.
	   ``That's a big issue in'' November's congressional elections, he
said.
	   Rubin told his audience that finance officials from 22 nations
who have been studying since last spring ways to overhaul the
global financial system would present some preliminary
recommendations Monday.
	   The proposals will be aimed at providing greater openness at the
IMF, pushing countries to release better and more timely data on
their economic conditions, improving banking regulation around the
world and forcing multinational banks and wealthy investors to bear
more of the pain when their investments in emerging markets
suddenly go bad.
	   Meanwhile, Greenspan was assuring a congressional committee that
Federal Reserve officials were right last week when they brokered a
dlrs 3.6 billion bailout of Long-Term Capital Management LP by
private banks and investment houses, arguing that if the investment
hedge fund been allowed to fail it could have produced disastrous
ripple effects through the U.S. financial system.
	   Greenspan said Fed officials were worried about the potential
for a disruptive ``fire sale,'' if the fund were liquidated that
would have risked a credit crunch for other borrowers.
	   Underscoring worries about a potential credit crunch, the Fed
released a survey Thursday that showed the nation's largest banks
have begun hesitating about making loans because of growing worries
about risks.
	   Wall Street is worried about whether loans to businesses, the
fuel that spurs economic growth, could start drying up, further
slowing a U.S. economy already feeling the effects of the Asian
crisis from the loss of export markets for American manufacturers
and farmers.
	   Rubin on Thursday repeated pledges that the United States stands
ready to help Brazil, South America's biggest economy, as officials
worked behind the scenes to put together a dlrs 25 billion to dlrs
30 billion rescue package expected to be announced after Sunday's
presidential elections in that country.
	   Japan, which has been criticized for not doing enough to
jump-start its own moribund economy or shore up its shaky banking
system, was coming to the weekend meetings in Washington with a
proposed assistance package of dlrs 30 billion in loans and credits
it will offer its troubled Asian neighbors.
	   Rubin gave cautious approval to the proposal while stressing
that the most important thing the world needs from Japan is an
effort to get its own economy back on track so that it can ``once
again be the engine of growth'' for the rest of Asia.

Chairman of troubled UBS resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The chairman of UBS AG, the Swiss
banking giant that said it will lose 2.2 billion Swiss francs (dlrs
1.61 billion) due largely to its involvement in a troubled private
U.S. investment fund, resigned Friday.
	   In a press release, Mathis Cabiallavetta said ``the conviction
that I can prove my service to the bank with this step moved me to
do this.''
	   Three other top UBS executives also are leaving their posts, the
announcement said.
	   Resignations were expected after the bank said on Monday it
would have the results of an internal investigation of the losses
by Friday.
	   Last Thursday, UBS said it will incur a 950 million franc (dlrs
699 million) write down on its exposure to private U.S. investment
partnership Long Term Capital Management, which combined with other
losses, will lead to a third quarter after tax loss of up to 1
billion francs (dlrs 735 million).
	   An internal inquiry uncovered lapses by responsible managers
both in controls and decisions, before and after the merger, UBS
said. The internal probe found no signs that any of the persons
involved had acted with gross negligence, UBS said.
	   UBS said transactions like LTCM won't happen in the future. ``We
understand the adjustment of risk parameters as an act of
responsibility towards our clients, shareholders and employees,''
said Marcel Ospel, chief executive officer.
	   UBS was formed mid-1998 from the merger of two major Swiss
banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp.
	   Replacing Cabiallavetta, who UBS said quit to help restore
confidence to the bank, is Alex Krauer, chairman of drug giant
Novartis, and also vice-chairman of UBS.
	   Krauer shepherded the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz that
formed Novartis a few years ago.
	   The disclosure led to dismay in the market and in the bank
itself. The bank's top management on Monday issued a memo to
reassure employees that UBS remained sound and that the probe was
well under way to determine the causes of the losses and who was
responsible.
	   The bank said three other executives left by ``mutual
agreement,'' including Felix Fischer, chief risk officer of UBS;
Werner Bonadurer, former co-chief operating office of Warburg
Dillon Read; and Andrew Siciliano, former head of rates at Warburg.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's new government will be
elected Saturday through a convoluted voting system that can
deliver victory to a party that is not the first choice of a
majority of voters.
	   Candidates for the 148-member House of Representatives, where
the government is chosen, are elected using a multiple-preference
voting system.
	   About 12 million Australians are registered to vote and will be
fined if they don't.
	   Voters in each electorate are given a ballot card that lists all
candidates. Voters mark the card with a number next to each
candidate in the order of their preference.
	   If a candidate wins more than 50 percent of the ``1'' votes, he
or she is declared elected.
	   If no candidate has more than half the votes, the candidate with
the fewest votes is excluded and that person's votes are
transferred to the other candidates according the second preference
on those ballots. This process continues until one candidate has a
majority.
	   Candidates seek to influence the outcome by giving electors
``how to vote cards,'' which suggest how to allocate preferences.
In closely contested districts, the preferences often decide the
winner.
	   The system favors the two main sides of politics, the Labor
Party and the conservative Liberal/National Party coalition.
	   It also means that government can be formed by a party that does
not attract more than 50 percent of first, or primary, votes.
	   For example, in the 1993 election the incumbent Labor government
won 39.4 percent of the primary vote against the coalition's 43.2
percent. But after the allocation of preferences, Labor won nine
more electorates than the coalition.
	   In the Senate, the upper house of Australia's bicameral
Parliament, 40 of the 76 seats will be up for election on Saturday.
	   Senators are elected under a system of quota-based proportional
representation. Each of Australia's six states have six senators,
with two each for the nation's two territories.
	   Candidates who reach the quota _ for Saturday's election 14.3
percent of the vote in each state _ are elected.
	   Senate voting favors minor party candidates, and the government
has not held the balance of power in the Senate for decades.

Ice cores suggest global climate change 12,500 years ago
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The top and the bottom of the Earth turned
sharply warmer at the same time 12,500 years ago, suggesting that
some climate change events once thought to be regional may have
affected the entire planet.
	   In a study Friday in the journal Science, researchers said that
climate temperatures climbed by more than 20 degrees (12 Celsius),
enough to melt sea ice and end the planet's last major ice age.
	   James White, a climatologist at the University of Colorado,
Boulder, said that an analysis of new ice cores from the Antarctica
show that the south polar area went through a rapid temperature
increase at the same time the north polar region was warming.
	   White, co-author of the study, said that the Antarctica ice
cores show a temperature increase of about 20 degrees Fahrenheit
(12 degrees Celcius) within a very short time.
	   Ice cores from Greenland, near the Arctic, show that at the same
time there was a temperature increase of almost 59 degrees (36
degrees Celcius) in the north polar region within a 50-year period,
White said.
	   ``What we see in Antarctica looks very, very similar to what we
see in Greenland,'' said White. ``We used to suspect that some of
these big changes that occurred naturally in the past were only
local. Since we see the same thing at opposite ends of the Earth,
it does imply that the warming was a global phenomena.''
	   He said the findings ``throw a monkey wrench into paleo-climate
research and rearrange our thinking about climate change at that
time.''
	   White said researchers need to look more closely at how the
Earth's climate slipped from an ice age that ended about 12,500
years ago and shifted into the current, more temperate climate.
	   The findings, he said, also increase the urgency for researchers
to understand climate shifts because it appears they could be
abrupt and happen all over the Earth at the roughly the same time.
	   ``The challenge is to determine if a climate change will be a
nice and gradual thing that we can adapt to or will it be a mode
shift that happens suddenly,'' said White.
	   The warming 12,500 years ago came within a typical human
lifetime. Such rapid shifts in the climate on a global basis would
make it very difficult for humans to adjust, he said. Climate
affects agriculture, energy use, transportation and population
shifts, and rapid changes would make adjustment in these areas more
difficult.
	   White said the Antarctica ice cores also showed that there was a
sudden rise in methane, a major greenhouse gas. Methane, carbon
dioxide and some other gases can accumulate in the atmosphere and
trap heat from the sun, causing a general warming.
	   Many scientists now believe that the Earth's climate may be
warming because the burning of fossil fuels and other human
processes have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere.
	   White said that global warming caused by man-made greenhouse
gases may be similar to warming that may occur naturally.
	   ``What humans are doing is in a way no different than what
natural systems do,'' he said. ``Humans add methane to the
atmosphere. So does nature. We are simply doing it faster.''
	   For this reason, said White, studying natural climate change of
the past may give a fundamental understanding of how human actions
could change the climate in the future.
	   Thomas F. Stocker of the Physics Institute at the University of
Bern, Switzerland, said the research reported by White and his
colleagues is surprising. Stocker wrote in Science that the study
suggests warming in Antarctica ``may be synchronous with the
well-documented abrupt warming 12,500 years ago in the Northern
Hemisphere.''
	   Stocker said more analysis of White's ice core and a comparison
with ice cores obtained elsewhere in Antarctica ``are required to
get a clearer picture'' of the south polar climate change.

Government, parliament mull ways to fight economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government will decide how to grapple
with the nation's economic crisis only after consultations with
international lenders, a parliamentary deputy said Friday.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov met with leaders of the lower
house of parliament, the State Duma, to discuss how the government
planned to meet its debts to state-funded institutions. Later in
the day, he and Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko were to
travel to Washington for talks with the International Monetary
Fund.
	   Nikolai Kharitonov, head of the Agrarian Party faction, said the
government's crisis program ``is most likely to be composed after
we check our watches with the IMF, that is, when it becomes clear
what we can count on _ only on ourselves or on some outside
support,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Thursday that he might be
forced to take ``unpopular measures'' to salvage the Russian
economy if the IMF didn't come through with more money.
	   Russia has been trying to pressure the lending agency into
releasing the second, dlrs 4.3 billion installment of a loan that
was approved in July, a month before the country's economy crashed
and the government effectively defaulted on its foreign loans.
	   The IMF credit would allow Russia to come out of the crisis
``with minimum losses,'' Primakov said. Without the loan, he added,
``We will take measures _ measures that may be quite unpopular. We
will not throw our country to the winds.''
	   IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to come
up with a sound economic program before the loan is given, and have
made it clear that currency controls and boosting the money supply
by printing rubles are not acceptable. Both options are reportedly
under consideration by the new government.
	   The government is reportedly considering an economic plan that
is heavy with Soviet-style controls on the economy. Primakov said
that the plan, which was outlined Thursday in the Kommersant
business daily, is just one of six alternatives his Cabinet was
considering.

	   Resignations were expected after the bank said Monday it would

controls and decisions, before and after the merger, UBS said. It
found no signs that any of the persons involved had acted with

	   UBS said transactions like LTCM won't happen again. The bank's
chief executive officer Marcel Ospel called the involvement in LTCM
an extremely complex case demonstrating ``disappointing'' risk
management. He promised the bank will learn lessons and improve its
risk controls.
	   UBS said Cabiallavetta quit to restore confidence to the bank.
Krauer, vice-chairman of UBS and also chairman of drug giant
Novartis, told a news conference that confidence ``wouldn't be
given to us as a gift'' and said staff changes wouldn't be enough.
He said he regretted the losses but suggested the negative reaction
was ``overdone.''
	   ``We promise to do everything so as to not disappoint,'' he
said. The board retained ``full confidence'' in Ospel and his team
and a new chairman would be sought as quickly as possible, Krauer
said.
	   UBS was formed mid-1998 from the merger of two major Swiss
banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp.
	   The disclosure caused market dismay and in the bank itself. The

investigation, but refused to give details.
	   The inquiry uncovered lapses by responsible managers both in
controls and decisions, before and after the merger, UBS said. It
found no signs that any of the persons involved had acted with
gross negligence, the bank added.
	   UBS said transactions like LTCM won't happen again. The bank's
chief executive officer Marcel Ospel called the involvement in LTCM
an extremely complex case demonstrating ``disappointing'' risk
management. He promised the bank will learn lessons and improve its
risk controls.
	   UBS said Cabiallavetta quit to restore confidence to the bank.
Krauer, vice-chairman of UBS and also chairman of drug giant
Novartis, told a news conference that confidence ``wouldn't be
given to us as a gift'' and said staff changes wouldn't be enough.
He said he regretted the losses but suggested the negative reaction
was ``overdone.''
	   ``We promise to do everything so as to not disappoint,'' he
said. The board retained ``full confidence'' in Ospel and his team
and a new chairman would be sought as quickly as possible, Krauer
said.
	   UBS was formed mid-1998 from the merger of two major Swiss
banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp.
	   The disclosure caused market dismay and in the bank itself. The
bank's top management on Monday issued a memo to reassure employees
that UBS remained sound and that it was investigating.
	   The bank said three other executives left by ``mutual
agreement,'' including Felix Fischer, chief risk officer of UBS;
Werner Bonadurer, former co-chief operating office of Warburg
Dillon Read; and Andrew Siciliano, former head of rates at Warburg.

Japanese stocks close mixed, dollar drops in Tokyo

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese shares closed mixed Friday, with the key
stock index edging higher after dipping to a new 12-year low in
earlier trading. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
26.57 points, or 0.20 percent, closing at 13,223.69. Earlier in the
day, it had slipped below 13,000 for the first time since January
1986.
	   On Thursday, the index had lost 209.27 points, or 1.56 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 1.70 points, or 0.17
percent, to 1,014.02. It had fallen 27.85 points, or 2.61 percent,
the previous day.
	   Traders said investors worried about prospects for profit growth
at exporting companies in the wake of a two-day slide by U.S.
stocks. But they said that was offset by optimism about quick
passage of key bank recovery bills and hope that trading partners
at a weekend Group of Seven meeting would urge Japan to boost
growth.
	   ``People are hopeful of what might happen over the weekend,''
said Louis Tseng, head of derivatives trading in the Tokyo office
of Jardine Fleming Securities Co.
	   In early trading, stocks sank in reaction to the Dow Jones
industrial average's 210.09 point, or 2.7 percent, drop on Thursday
to a close of 7,632.53. Wall Street had suffered a similar setback
the previous day.
	   Losses were stemmed, however, by apparent buying by public funds
targeting Japanese stock futures, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar bought 134.86 yen in midafternoon trading,
down 1.42 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late
New York level of 135.63 yen overnight.
	   ``There aren't many reasons to buy the dollar now,'' said Ryohei
Muramatsu, foreign exchange manager at Commerzbank in Tokyo.
	   Many market players expected that the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank
might follow up its interest rate cut earlier this week with more
cuts in coming months, traders said.
	   Currency dealers were also reluctant to buy dollars for yen
before the meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from
the Group of Seven industrialized countries in Washington over the
weekend, they said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.715 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.720 percent,
driving its price up to 109.84 yen from 109.79 yen.

Mrs. Clinton touts basic economic issues to women of Americas

<TEXT>
	   MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton came to South
America to talk to women about women. And she triggered an
outpouring of enthusiasm with her speeches to politically oriented
audiences _ the first ladies of the hemisphere and the multiparty
Women's Political Network in Uruguay.
	   But her campaign for women's rights _ to be addressed again
Friday with a speech to 400 women of all socio-economic levels from
all the Americas _ wasn't just about political success.
	   It was about money, too.
	   Not easy stuff, but the details: unsexy topics, like access to
credit.
	   Such access ``is one of the surest ways to change women's lives
around the world,'' enabling them to start their own businesses,
generating income for their families, she told the Uruguayan women
packed Thursday into an ornate ballroom of the Legislative Palace.
	   ``Unfortunately, many commercial banks don't see women as good
credit risks,'' she said, despite studies showing poor women paid
off their debts at a rate of 95 percent to 99 percent.
	   What to do?
	   Change the attitudes of people with money, most of whom are
``educated, affluent men who don't think much of poor, uneducated
women's chances to be economically independent,'' she said.
	   And that requires political power.
	   ``Clearly, you cannot advance the cause of women without active
participation by women in the political process,'' she said.
	   Changing attitudes of all kinds is essential, she said, revving
up the intensity, and speed, of her speech.
	   Of prime concern to her was what she called the ``old thinking''
that women's issues concerned women's problems. In truth, she said,
they are society's problems.
	   ``It's not a women's issue to equip women to be self-sufficient
and economically independent,'' she said. ``That is an economic
issue.''
	   ``It is not a woman's issue to make sure domestic violence is
treated as a crime. That is a legal issue,'' she said, her
rapid-fire delivery cut off by a burst of applause from the crowd.
	   Some women attending weren't quite sure what to expect before
Mrs. Clinton arrived, but were anxious to see the woman simply
called ``Hillary'' in newspaper headlines even so far from home.
	   ``I came to know her in a different way than I know her through
the media,'' said Monica Elena Travieso, a high school teacher from
San Jose, 60 miles (95 kilometers) west of Montevideo, and a member
of the left-leaning New Space party. ``I know she's a lawyer, I
know she's worked a lot on civil rights issues,'' she said, ``...
but I wanted a more human contact.''

Malaysian party leader rejects reform after police free him

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A former ally of ousted deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim said Friday he had resigned his
high-level ruling party post while in police detention and he
rejected his mentor's reform movement.
	   ``I've never been involved, nor will I ever be, in the reform
movement,'' Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told a news conference two days
after he was freed from police detention.
	   The president of the youth wing of the United Malays National
Organization had been held for nine days without access to lawyers
or family.
	   Zahid said he wrote a letter dated Sept. 29 to the party's
president, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, announcing his
resignation.
	   Police released him the following day.
	   Zahid was one of 17 Anwar associates and leaders of opposition
parties rounded up as national security risks after Anwar launched
a nationwide campaign of rallies calling for Mahathir's resignation
and political reforms.
	   Seven of those held under the Internal Security Act, which
allows indefinite detention without charge, have been freed. Two
have confessed in court to illegal homosexual acts with Anwar and
been sentenced to six months in prison.
	   Anwar, held under the same law, was brought to court Tuesday
after nine days in detention, with bruises on his face, neck and
arms that he said resulted from police beatings.
	   After differing over economic policy for months, Mahathir fired
Anwar on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime minister and
finance minister, saying he was morally unfit for office. The
party's Supreme Council expelled Anwar the next day.
	   Zahid stressed at his news conference that he would remain in
the party, called UMNO. ``As a responsible leader, I feel that a
resignation is what I should have done. This is my final sacrifice
for UMNO Youth.''
	   He denied that his resignation was a response to pressure from
other senior UMNO Youth officials, who repeatedly called for their
detained leader to resign because he had appeared with Anwar at
news conferences and rallies at he fired Cabinet minister's home.
	   For years, Zahid flourished under Anwar's patronage, just as
Anwar had been promoted and groomed for leadership by Mahathir.
	   When Anwar decided to mount a covert challenge against the
17-year rule of Mahathir, Zahid became Anwar's point man.
	   He zinged off a fiery message to senior delegates at UMNO's
annual gathering in June, calling for sweeping reforms in the
party, which he said was infected with ``corruption, cronyism and
nepotism.''
	   In Friday's meeting with reporters, however, Zahid didn't once
mention Anwar's name and walked off without answering any
questions.
	   He said the authorities arrested him on Sept. 21 for alleged
involvement with Anwar's anti-government campaign, which resulted
in massive gatherings in various state capitals in the Southeast
Asian nation.
	   ``The police questioning was very professionally done and there
was no verbal abuse or physical assault,'' he said, thanking his
captors for their professionalism.
	   Minutes after his terse media conference, a party aide entered
Zahid's office and removed a massive portrait of Zahid, both arms
still raised in a victory pose.

Five arrested for allegedly planning protest in Irian Jaya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police have arrested five people on
charges of planning a pro-independence protest in Irian Jaya, an
Indonesian province on New Guinea Island.
	   The five were detained Wednesday night in Jayapura, the
provincial capital of Irian Jaya, about 2,300 miles (3,700
kilometers) east of Jakarta, the official Antara news agency
reported.
	   It quoted Brig. Gen. Hotman Siagian, chief of the local police,
as saying the five have been formally detained as suspects.
	   Among them were Don Flasi, secretary of the local development
planning agency, and priest Agustinus Ansanay.
	   Siagian said police also have summoned a number of people
including Martinus Werimon, chairman of the student senate of the
state-run Cendrawasih University, for interrogation.
	   Siagian did not rule out possible interrogation of Yoris
Raweyai, an Irianese member of the People's Consultative Assembly
who allegedly masterminded a plan to hold protests Thursday and
Friday.
	   Security personnel had tightly guarded some strategic places in
the provincial town since Wednesday, Antara said.
	   Indonesia took over the former Dutch colony that covers the
western portion of New Guinea Island in 1963 and named it Irian
Jaya.
	   A small rebel group, called OPM or Free Papua Movement, has been
fighting since then for independence.
	   In July, a series of pro-independence protests flared up in the
remote province. At least two protesters and one policeman were
killed.

Parties hold talks in Lesotho
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Opposition and government parties sat
down with mediators Friday in this looted capital to resolve
political turmoil that led to South Africa's military intervention
last week.
	   Leading the mediators was South Africa's security minister,
Sydney Mufamadi, who was joined by representatives from Zimbabwe,
Botswana and Mozambique in the talks at U.N. offices here, said a
government spokesman in Pretoria, Ricky Naidoo.
	   Protests by opposition parties supported by mutinous soldiers
and paralysis by the government led to the intervention, which
provoked widespread hostility in Lesotho and broad criticism in
South Africa.
	   Nearly 100 people, including 67 soldiers from the two countries,
died in battles. The capital was heavily damaged by looters in the
poor mountain monarchy of 2 million people inside South African
territory.
	   On Thursday, Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili of the ruling
Lesotho Congress Party declared he would not share political power,
as the opposition groups have demanded.
	   The Lesotho Congress Party controls 79 of the 80 seats in
Parliament, though it only won 61 percent of the vote in May
elections. The opposition charges the election was fraudulent, a
conclusion not reached by independent electoral observers.
	   A regional commission found irregularities in the voting but not
enough to warrant overturning the result.

Renegade faction of Thai political party appeals expulsion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A renegade faction of Thai politicians
whose support enabled Chuan Leekpai to become prime minister will
appeal to the Constitutional Court over being expelled from their
political party, the faction leader said Friday.
	   The Prachakorn Thai (Thai Citizens) party voted Thursday to
dismiss the 12 lawmakers from its executive board because they
broke with the leadership and joined Chuan's Democrat-led coalition
government last November.
	   Prachakorn Thai leader Samak Sundaravej, a conservative and
bitter foe of Chuan, was enraged at what he considered a betrayal
by the 12.
	   He dubbed them the ``Cobra Faction'' and the name has stuck.
	   Samak was quoted in Friday's newspapers as saying the board
would vote Oct. 20 to expel them from the party entirely.
	   Samak had hoped that with expulsion from the party, they would
lose their seats in parliament and rob Chuan of his majority in the
assembly.
	   But Chuan is arranging to bring another opposition party, the
Chart Pattana (National Development) party, into the coalition.
Adding Chart Pattana, which has 51 seats, would more than offset
the loss of the Cobras.
	   Also, several legal analysts have said that under Thailand's new
constitution, the Cobras would not lose their parliamentary seats
as long as another party is willing to take them in.
	   The Constitutional Court had ruled several months ago that it
was legal for Samak to increase the size of the party's executive
board. He packed it with loyalists who then voted to boot the
Cobras out.
	   Cobra leader Vatana Asavahame said Friday his faction would seek
an explanation from the court as to why the law permits them to be
expelled.

Chechen leader accuses United States of destabilization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of the breakaway region of Chechnya
accused the United States of trying to destabilize southern Russia,
the Interfax news agency reported Friday.
	   President Aslan Maskhadov said that the United States was using
Saudi Arabia as a proxy that is ``generously financing so-called
pure Islam'' in Chechnya and elsewhere in the restive Caucasus
region.
	   Maskhadov has previously protested alleged Saudi financing of
the Wahhabis, a small, radical Islamic sect that has posed a threat
to his authority. At least six people were killed in July clashes
between Chechen forces and members of the sect.
	   A group of Wahhabis recently tried unsuccessfully to create a
separate Islamic state in Dagestan, a Russian republic that borders
on Chechnya and suffers continual strife between rival ethnic and
political groups.
	   The United States' alleged activity ``poses a serious threat to
Chechnya, because America and the West are more dangerous than
Russia,'' Interfax quoted Maskhadov as telling his Cabinet on
Thursday.
	   Maskhadov dismissed his government Thursday, but said its
members would continue to hold their jobs until replacements are
found. Maskhadov himself has been coming under increasing pressure
from political opponents demanding his resignation.
	   The Chechen government has been struggling with rampant crime
and violence. It considers Chechnya fully independent of Russia,
but Moscow still claims sovereignty there.

Thai politician's policeman son sought in assault
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai police lieutenant, the son of a
controversial politician, was being sought after he allegedly beat
up his ex-girlfriend outside a Bangkok discotheque, police said
Friday.
	   Police have issued a warrant for Art-harn Yubamrung, son of
Chalerm Yubamrung, deputy leader of former Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh's New Aspiration Party.
	   Chalerm, who is also a police captain, has a reputation for
making outlandish charges of corruption and wrongdoing against his
political enemies, but rarely providing any evidence to support his
claims.
	   His two sons, both police lieutenants, have frequently been in
trouble with the law, most frequently for alleged assaults in
nightclubs and discotheques.
	   Neither of Chalerm's sons has ever gone to jail. Witnesses and
victims almost always mysteriously fail to show up for court
proceedings or say they cannot remember who assaulted them.
	   The politician has called news conferences in the past to assert
his sons' innocence and describe charges against them as resulting
from a conspiracy by his political rivals.
	   In the latest case, 21-year-old Pathitta Phan-oros told police
her ex-boyfriend, Art-han beat her up outside the Narcissus
discotheque Thursday night.
	   Police said she had bruises on her face, mouth and arms.
	   Pathitta told police that Art-harn began verbally abusing her
when she ran into him in the club. She responded by throwing water
in his face.
	   She said Art-harn had two friends drag her outside the
discotheque to the parking lot, where they began assaulting her.
	   She told police she had ended her six-month relationship with
Art-harn because of his abusive behavior.

One miner killed, three believed dead in accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ One miner was killed and three others were
believed dead after a sudden eruption of coal and gas trapped them
in a remote shaft of a mine in eastern Ukraine, officials said
Friday.
	   The accident occurred Thursday at the Bulavinska mine in the
city of Yenakievo in Ukraine's coal-rich Donetsk region, the
Emergency Situations Ministry reported.
	   Rescue teams clearing the way to the miners, who were blocked at
a depth of 530 meters (1,739 feet), found one dead body early
Friday, the ministry said.
	   The fate of the other three miners remains unconfirmed, but
rescuers said there was little hope that they had survived.
	   A total of 299 people have died in mine accidents in Ukraine
since the beginning of 1998. That's about 100 more than in the same
period last year, according to government statistics.
	   The number of miners killed on the job has been increasing
steadily in recent years because mines lack the funds needed to
modernize equipment and improve safety conditions.
	   The worst single accident this year occurred in April, when a
methane gas blast killed 63 workers at a mine in the Donetsk
region.

Brunei monarch's estranged brother returns home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ A prodigal prince who is
believed to have squandered billions of dollars of Brunei's money
has returned home to explain himself to his brother, the monarch.
	   Prince Jefri Bolkiah flew from London in a private jet late
Thursday, and a spokesman said he was going to settle matters
directly with Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.
	   Jefri drove straight to his seaside palace at Jerudong, about 16
kilometers (10 miles) south of the capital, Bandar Seri Begawan.
	   On Friday, Prince Jefri was scheduled to meet with officials of
the Amedeo Development Corp. and visit the sultan's palace.
	   Prince Jefri was abruptly removed from the controlling positions
of Brunei's flagship company, Amedeo, in July after a reported dlrs
16 billion loss. He was stripped of his post as head of the
nation's international investment arm, the Brunei Investment
Agency. The agency controls Brunei's overseas assets.
	   Relations between the royal siblings appeared to deteriorate
quickly after that in the tiny sultanate on the northwestern coast
of Borneo. The country has one of the world's highest annual per
capita incomes, at dlrs 15,800.
	   A spokesman for Jefri quoted the estranged prince as saying
conservative forces backed by shadowy foreign advisers from Iran
and Libya were tightening their grip on Brunei.
	   The government quickly denied it, but the monarch did not
comment on Jefri.
	   Reports in Brunei said the sultan also planned to strip his
brother of control over three large oil wells. Brunei's main income
is from oil and the sultan controls most of the underground
treasure.
	   Jefri has not been seen or heard from since the Amedeo troubles
were first reported in July by a British newspaper. However, he
communicated with some reporters through an anonymous spokesman.
	   ``Prince Jefri will make clear there has been no wrongdoing on
his part or that of his associates,'' the spokesman said in a
statement late Thursday.
	   ``He is determined to settle these matters in a constructive
manner and to make clear to the sultan the real motives behind the
actions of certain individuals in Brunei.''
	   The government said last month an investigation had proven there
had been misappropriation of Brunei's money while explaining the
reasons for taking over 13 companies controlled by Amedeo.
	   Funds of the BIA, it said, had gone into private hands, creating
``financial shortages'' in Amedeo and its units.
	   The Brunei royal family has a reputation for flamboyance, with
lavish palaces, fleets of cars and alleged all-night sex parties.
	   With cash from Amedeo, Prince Jefri, 43, bought a string of the
world's most prestigious hotels: the Plaza Athenee in Paris, the
New York Palace, the Dorchester Hotel in London and the Bel-Air in
Los Angeles.
	   Prince Jefri had been in the news earlier for his lifestyle,
extravagant even by Brunei's standards. Former Miss USA Shannon
Marketic had filed a suit against him and the sultan, alleging
their involvement in a scheme to lure American and European women
to Brunei for sex. A U.S. judge dismissed the case because of lack
of jurisdiction.

Philippine Airlines workers approval rescue plan

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Workers at Philippine Airlines have
voted by a wide margin to accept a management recovery plan that
will allow Asia's oldest carrier to reopen, officials said Friday.
	   About 61 percent of ballots cast by members of PAL's largest
union supported the plan, officials said. Under the proposal,
workers will accept a 10-year suspension of their collective
bargaining agreement in exchange for 20 percent of the company's
stock and seats on its board.
	   It was the second time that the 6,700 members of PAL's largest
union had voted on the rescue plan. Last week, they rejected the
proposal, forcing the airline to shut down and leaving much of the
country without air service.
	   Turnout for the second referendum was heavy, with about 80
percent of the union voting. Last week, less than half cast
ballots.
	   Asked whether he thought the results would allow PAL to fly
again by next Wednesday, President Joseph Estrada replied, ``I
believe so.''
	   He assured workers that he will defend their rights during the
10-year bargaining agreement suspension.
	   ``I'm willing to protect them at all costs. That I can assure
them, they have nothing to fear,'' he said.
	   On Thursday, PAL chairman and chief stockholder Lucio Tan asked
all of the airline's executives to submit resignations so that any
new investors could have a free hand in the company's management.
	   PAL has been ravaged by strikes and Asia's currency crisis. It
says creditors and investors have insisted on a suspension of the
union's bargaining agreement to ensure labor harmony before they
accept a restructuring of the company's finances.
	   Many union members had believed the government would not allow
the 57-year-old flag carrier to close. But when government-enlisted
foreign carriers began flying some domestic routes Monday, union
leaders reversed their position and agreed to accept the management
plan.
	   The agreement must be formally endorsed by workers, regulators
and PAL's creditors.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with militant
members saying a suspension of the bargaining agreement would
violate workers' rights.
	   Estrada says the government cannot take over the airline because
it does not have enough money to pay for its daily losses of up to
45 million pesos (dlrs 1 million).
	   Asia's currency crisis hit shortly after PAL launched a dlrs 4
billion modernization program, greatly inflating the amount of
money it must repay to overseas creditors. The airline has been
unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of debt.
	   Two foreign carriers, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific and Dragon
Airlines, have begun flying some domestic routes to help fill the
vacuum left by PAL's closure.

Two Palestinians caught with explosives en route to Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police caught two Hamas activists
with 130 pounds (60 kilos) of explosives near the border between
Israel and the Gaza Strip, a security official said Friday.
	   The two men apparently had planned to hand the explosives to
other Hamas members who were to sneak across the border into Israel
to carry out a bombing attack, said the official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The two men, along with the driver of their getaway car, were
arrested Sept. 24 near the Nahal Oz crossing between Gaza and
Israel, but the case was not made public because Palestinian police
hoped to catch accomplices still at large, the official said.
	   The security official denied an Israel radio report that
Palestinian police seized videotapes in a hideout used by the two
men who were caught. Suicide bombers routinely leave behind
videotapes in which they explain their actions and say goodbye to
their families.
	   Israel has been bracing for new attacks by Hamas, an Islamic
militant group which threatened retaliation for the Sept. 11
killings of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli soldiers. Since 1994,
Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings.
	   The Israeli defense minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, reportedly told
the Israeli Cabinet on Thursday that Hamas was planning to carry
out a ``horrifying, unprecedented'' attack.
	   In recent days, Hamas suffered a series of setbacks. On Monday,
Palestinian police raided a Hamas bomb factory in the West Bank
town of Hebron and seized nearly a ton of explosives. A week ago, a
Hamas activist was killed when a car rigged with explosives blew
up.
	   The leader of the group, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, acknowledged
Thursday that Hamas was facing difficulties in carrying out attacks
because of searches and arrests by Israeli and Palestinian troops.
	   However, Yassin said the group would eventually succeed. A Hamas
``response will come at the appropriate time, even if it is
delayed,'' Yassin said.

Pakistan gets edge over Australia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Paceman Wasim Akram had two wickets
on successive deliveries to give Pakistan an edge over Australia at
lunch on the second day of the first cricket Test at Rawalpindi
Cricket Stadium Friday.
	   And with Mushtaq Ahmed removing the troublesome Mark Waugh for
nought, things only got worse for the Australians as they went for
lunch at 55 for three with opener Michael Slater still there on 36
and Steve Waugh batting on nine.
	   Earlier Leg-spinner Stuart MacGill, playing in his second Test,
ended Pakistan's Saeed Anwar's over six hour vigil at the crease
when he had the left-hander caught at forward short leg by Justin
Langer for 145. Anwar faced 275 balls and his 12 boundaries during
his 386 minutes of stay at the wicket. Two balls later, Mushtaq
Ahmed could not get back in the crease in time for the third run
and was run out without adding a run to his overnight 26.
	   MacGill was the pick of the Australian bowlers with five for 66
while McGrath had two for 83.
	   Akram, back into the team after leading Lancashire to runner-up
position in the County Championship in England last month, had
skipper Mark Taylor caught behind for three in his fourth over.
	   The left-arm paceman then removed another left-hander Justin
Langer leg before on the very next delivery. Akram could have had
accomplished the hat-trick, had their been a fourth slip as Michael
Slater edged the hat-trick ball between the third slip and gully
for a boundary.

Chairman of troubled UBS resigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout with new material from Ospel; ADDS latest
share price. No pick up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The chairman of UBS AG, the Swiss
banking giant that said it will lose 2.2 billion Swiss francs (dlrs
1.61 billion) due largely to its involvement in a troubled private
U.S. investment fund, resigned Friday.
	   In a press release, Mathis Cabiallavetta said ``the conviction
that I can prove my service to the bank with this step moved me to
do this.'' Cabiallavetta declined any ``financial arrangement,''
the bank's chief executive officer Marcel Ospel said.
	   Three other top UBS executives are also leaving, the
announcement said. Ospel wouldn't discuss possible remuneration for
them because of contractual terms.
	   Last Thursday, UBS said it would incur a 950 million franc (dlrs
699 million) write down on its exposure to Long Term Capital
Management, which with other losses will lead to a third quarter
after tax-loss of up to 1 billion francs (dlrs 735 million).
	   An internal inquiry uncovered lapses by responsible managers in
controls and decisions before and after the merger, UBS said. It
found no signs that any of the persons involved acted with gross
negligence, the bank added.
	   UBS said transactions like LTCM won't happen again. Ospel called
its LTCM involvement an extremely complex case in which risk was
``very underestimated.''
	   He said the three executives were aware of that and thus left
the bank, but said Cabiallavetta wasn't aware of all the risks
involved. Ospel said the bank will learn lessons and improve risk
controls.
	   Part of the problem in reconstructing the LTCM case, Ospel said,
was that the fund only updated its partners once a month.
	   For a time, he said, ``we were flying blind.''
	   Ospel and interim chairman Alex Krauer said UBS first informed
Swiss federal regulators in early September that market turmoil had
caused the bank problems.
	   Last week, the bank told regulators of its losses' extent and,
later in the week, of the investigation's findings.
	   Krauer, vice-chairman of UBS and also chairman of drug giant
Novartis, told a news conference staff changes wouldn't be enough
to restore confidence in the bank. He regretted the losses but
suggested the negative reaction was ``overdone.''
	   ``We promise to do everything so as to not disappoint,'' he
said, adding that a new chairman would be sought quickly.
	   UBS' management on Monday reassured employees in a memo it
remained sound and that it was investigating.
	   The bank said executives leaving by ``mutual agreement'' include
Felix Fischer, chief risk officer of UBS; Werner Bonadurer, former
co-chief operating office of Warburg Dillon Read; and Andrew
Siciliano, former head of rates at Warburg.
	   In early trading Friday, UBS shares are up 6.9 percent, or 19
francs (dlrs 14), to 294 francs (dlrs 216) a share. Dealers said
the management shakeup represents a step toward the bank's taking
responsibility for the loss-making transactions.

Iraq demands probe of arms inspectors over ties to Israel, CIA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has accused United Nations arms
inspectors of working with foreign intelligence agencies hostile to
the country and demanded a special investigation into the U.N.
commission overseeing the inspections.
	   The government made the accusation in a letter from Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that was
reported Thursday night on Iraqi state television and quoted in
Friday's Iraqi dailies.
	   The Iraqi action follows reports in Israeli and American
newspapers quoting former arms inspector Scott Ritter as saying he
dealt with Israeli intelligence and the CIA in seeking information
on Iraq's weapons program.
	   In his letter Aziz urged an official investigation on the U.N.
Special Commission's ``connections and intelligence work that is
hostile to Iraq.''
	   The letter added such a step was necessary to ``guarantee the
United Nations' credibility, neutrality, and reputation.''
	   The Iraqi government has long maintained that some of the arms
inspectors were spies, Ritter in particular, and that the U.N.
Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, was not a neutral agency but
worked under the thumb of the United States.
	   The arms inspectors have the job of certifying that Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step under
U.N. resolutions before the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait can be lifted.
	   Referring to Ritter's quoted comments, Aziz' letter said ``these
statements show serious facts of which Iraq has warned several
times.''
	   ``UNSCOM, which works in the name of the U.N. Security Council
... is firmly connected with the intelligence agencies of states
that pursue anti-Iraq policies,'' the letter said.
	   ``The main source of information UNSCOM uses to peddle its false
claims, to carry out exposed espionage on Iraq, and to fabricate
crises, are U.S. and Israeli sources,'' Aziz said in the letter.
	   He added that ``the statements by Scott Ritter clearly show that
UNSCOM had not only collected information, but studied with the
U.S. and Israeli intelligence services ways to carry out its work
in Iraq.''
	   Iraq has long maintained that it has fulfilled its obligation
under U.N. resolutions, but the arms inspectors say the government
of President Saddam Hussein continues to hide weapons and the means
to make more.
	   Ritter, who resigned in an angry letter on Aug. 26, has since
spoken out several times on Iraq's weapons programs, maintaining
the United States and Britain did not stand behind UNSCOM as it
tried to do its job.
	   On Thursday, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the chief weapons
inspector, Richard Butler, had criticized Ritter for making public
details about Iraq's weapons programs. Butler wrote a letter to
Ritter accusing him of violating his U.N. contract by speaking to
the press, Eckhard said.
	   Earlier this week, Ritter told the Israeli daily Haaretz that he
had sought and received Israel's help in tracking down Iraq's
lethal weapons.
	   The Washington Post, citing unidentified sources, said Israel
described trucks and depots used by Iraq in moving forbidden
materials. Israel also told the inspectors that 40 tons of a
biological growth medium sold to Iraq by a British company were not
accounted for, the Post said.

Five firefighters injured battling Moscow store blaze
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Five firefighters were injured while battling a
blaze in a Moscow store, the city fire department said Friday.
	   The fire broke out at about 6 p.m. Thursday in the basement of
the Cleopatra plumbing fixtures store and raged for nine hours. The
five firefighters were hurt when the fire _ fueled by synthetic
carpets, oil-filled space heaters and other inflammable materials _
suddenly intensified, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Nikolai Sarychev, a spokesman for the fire department, said that
investigators did not yet know what had caused the fire. He said
that the firefighters' injuries were not serious.

	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A U.N. court on Friday ordered a former
Rwandan mayor to serve three life sentences for convictions of
genocide and crimes against humanity, plus 80 years for other
violations including rape.
	   In the first judgment by an international court on genocide,
Jean-Paul Akayesu was convicted Sept. 2 of nine counts of genocide,
crimes against humanity and rape.
	   Akayesu had made an impassioned plea Monday for forgiveness from
the Rwandan people for the genocide of more than 500,000 people,
mostly minority Tutsis, in 1994.

Chairman of troubled UBS resigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout with new material from Ospel; ADDS latest

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The chairman of UBS AG, the Swiss
banking giant that said it will lose 2.2 billion Swiss francs (dlrs
1.61 billion) due largely to its involvement in a troubled private
U.S. investment fund, resigned Friday.
	   In a press release, Mathis Cabiallavetta said ``the conviction
that I can prove my service to the bank with this step moved me to
do this.'' Cabiallavetta declined any ``financial arrangement,''
the bank's chief executive officer Marcel Ospel said.
	   Three other top UBS executives are also leaving, the
announcement said. Ospel wouldn't discuss possible remuneration for
them because of contractual terms.
	   Last Thursday, UBS said it would incur a 950 million franc (dlrs
699 million) write down on its exposure to Long Term Capital
Management, which with other losses will lead to a third quarter
after tax-loss of up to 1 billion francs (dlrs 735 million).
	   An internal inquiry uncovered lapses by responsible managers in
controls and decisions before and after the merger, UBS said. It
found no signs that any of the persons involved acted with gross
negligence, the bank added.
	   UBS said transactions like LTCM won't happen again. Ospel called
its LTCM involvement an extremely complex case in which risk was
``very underestimated.''
	   He said the three executives were aware of that and thus left
the bank, but said Cabiallavetta wasn't aware of all the risks
involved. Ospel said the bank will learn lessons and improve risk
controls.
	   Part of the problem in reconstructing the LTCM case, Ospel said,
was that the fund only updated its partners once a month.
	   For a time, he said, ``we were flying blind.''
	   Ospel and interim chairman Alex Krauer said UBS first informed
Swiss federal regulators in early September that market turmoil had
caused the bank problems.
	   Last week, the bank told regulators of its losses' extent and,
later in the week, of the investigation's findings.
	   Krauer, vice-chairman of UBS and also chairman of drug giant
Novartis, told a news conference staff changes wouldn't be enough
to restore confidence in the bank. He regretted the losses but
suggested the negative reaction was ``overdone.''
	   ``We promise to do everything so as to not disappoint,'' he
said, adding that a new chairman would be sought quickly.
	   UBS' management on Monday reassured employees in a memo it
remained sound and that it was investigating.
	   The bank said executives leaving by ``mutual agreement'' include
Felix Fischer, chief risk officer of UBS; Werner Bonadurer, former
co-chief operating office of Warburg Dillon Read; and Andrew
Siciliano, former head of rates at Warburg.
	   In early trading Friday, UBS shares are up 6.9 percent, or 19
francs (dlrs 14), to 294 francs (dlrs 216) a share. Dealers said
the management shakeup represents a step toward the bank's taking
responsibility for the loss-making transactions.

Malaysian police probe Anwar's jailhouse injuries

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Amid mounting concern over the
treatment of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's former deputy,
police on Friday began probing allegations that Anwar Ibrahim was
beaten on his first night of captivity.
	   A team led by a police officer from the southern state of
Malacca, not involved in the case, will question the officers
assigned to interrogate the 51-year-old dissident who is
challenging Mahathir's rule.
	   At arraignments Tuesday and Wednesday on 10 charges of sodomy
and corruption, Anwar told the courts he was beaten by police on
Sept. 20, the night of his arrest. With a black eye, and bruises on
his neck and arms, he pleaded innocent to all charges.
	   Mahathir, 72, initially suggested that Anwar had inflicted his
own injuries to gain public sympathy.
	   But as condemnation grew and newspapers worldwide published
pictures of Anwar's welts and bruises, Mahathir ordered an
investigation.
	   No timetable for it has been announced.
	   On Thursday, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged
in a message to Mahathir that Anwar be treated properly in
accordance with the rule of law.
	   Annan said he was heartened by Mahathir's subsequent statement
that the reports of physical abuse would be investigated.
	   World Bank President James Wolfensohn said he was troubled by
the photographs of Anwar.
	   He said Anwar was to have played a key role at the annual
meetings of the bank and the International Monetary Fund, now under
way, as chairman of a 24-nation committee that represents the
interests of developing countries.
	   Speaking in a personal capacity, Wolfensohn called Anwar ``a
friend who had a real position in our group. I hope the world keeps
an eye on him and he gets a chance to state his case.''
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime
minister and finance minister, saying he was morally unfit for
office. The two had differed over economic policy as the country
veered into recession and Anwar has said Mahathir feared him as an
alternative leader.
	   Anwar conducted nationwide rallies calling for Mahathir's
resignation, and thousands of Malaysians continued the protests in
Kuala Lumpur after his arrest.
	   Friday prayers at mosques around the capital ended peacefully,
despite rumors of demonstrations. There were no police at monuments
in the downtown area for the first time this week. And inside the
National Mosque, there was no chanting for Anwar and reform, as had
occurred last week.
	   Meanwhile, Malaysia's Bar Council, angered by police questioning
of a defense attorney who accompanied Anwar's wife to police
headquarters Thursday, called for an Oct. 10 meeting.
	   The purpose is to discuss detentions such as Anwar's under the
Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite detention without
charge. Detainees are often denied access to lawyers or family.
	   The Bar Council described the British colonial law as an ``an
obnoxious piece of legislation undermining fundamental human
rights, basic democratic principles and the rule of law.''
	   The council demanded that ``members of the bar who are acting in
the defense of their clients be allowed to carry out their duties
freely without any harassment, hindrance or restraint by the
authorities.''
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, was summoned to police headquarters
Thursday for the third time to answer questions about a television
interview expressing fears for her husband's health. Police also
interrogated her lawyer, and traveled to Singapore to question the
CNBC Asia journalists who interviewed her.

	   Judge Laity Kama said Akayesu ``chose to participate in the
genocide,'' and should therefore spend the rest of his life in
prison.
	   ``The chamber is of the opinion... that genocide constitutes the
crime of crimes,'' Kama told the court. ``The sentences should be
served concurrently and therefore (the chamber) sentences Akayesu
to (what amounts to) a single sentence of life.''
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was formed in
Nov. 1994, just months after an extremist Hutu government sponsored
the slaughter of Tutsis. More than 500,000 Tutsis and moderate
Hutus were killed.

Malaysian Central Bank: No hope of avoiding recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's Central Bank on Friday
confirmed what most people already know. There is no hope of
avoiding a recession in 1998.
	   Central Bank Governor Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman said the economy
will not be able to offset the contractions posted in this year's
first two quarters, the national news agency Bernama reported.
	   The economy contracted 2.8 percent in the first quarter and 6.8
percent in the second. Independent analysts say the economy is
likely to shrink by 5 percent for all of 1998.
	   Ali Abul said he was confident that growth would resume
following capital control and other economic measures taken early
last month. He didn't, however, specify when.
	   Malaysia recently moved away from the tight monetary policy
followed by its former finance minister and deputy prime minister,
Anwar Ibrahim. Anwar is now in jail facing 10 counts of corruption
and homosexual acts, charges he says were brought because he
opposed Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule.
	   Mahathir took over as Malaysia's finance minister after firing
Anwar on Sept. 2.
	   Now, with softer lending rules and a policy that allows banks to
use more of their reserves, the economy is flooded with cash.
Interest rates are down, but it remains unclear whether people are
borrowing more.
	   On Sept. 1, Malaysia virtually closed the capital account,
bringing all ringgit trading onshore. The next day, it pegged the
currency at 3.80 ringgit to one U.S. dollar.
	   Ali Abul said the ringgit's peg to the dollar would stay until
rules and regulations are introduced to curb excessive speculation
in the global market. Mahathir says battering of the ringgit by
speculators brought on Malaysia's crisis and it did not reflect
weaknesses of the financial sector.
	   Before capital controls were imposed, the U.S. dollar was
fetching about 4.20 ringgit, 10 percent higher than the current
peg.

Military officers, arms dealers arrested for alleged secrets leaks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Four military officers and two arms
brokers were arrested Friday on charges of leaking classified
information on South Korea's arms procurement programs.
	   The officers were accused of providing arms dealers Shin
Dong-yoon, 56, and Kim Jang-hwan, 51, with details of Seoul's plans
to buy surveillance aircraft, new fighter planes and air-to-surface
missiles.
	   The Defense Ministry called the officers ``colonel-level'' but
declined to provide further details pending an investigation of
other military officers and arms dealers.
	   Shin and Kim sent the classified data to their U.S.-based
business partner, Linda Kim, 41, between February 1997 and last
March, ministry officials said.
	   Linda Kim, who was not arrested, runs an arms dealing agency
called IMCL and was believed to be a consultant for E-Systems Inc.
of Plano, Texas, officials said.
	   Prosecutors said they planned to charge the six arrested men
with violating laws on protecting classified military information.
	   South Korea, still technically at war with communist North
Korea, is a major buyer of U.S. arms. It plans to spend dlrs 33.6
billion on new weapons through 2004.

	   Akayesu was the mayor of the central village of Taba where 2,000
Tutsis who sought his help were killed. He has maintained his
innocence, claiming he was unable to stop the slaughter.
	   Acting in his own defense, Akayesu on Monday had asked for a
pardon from the Rwandan people saying he regretted what happened
``from the bottom of my heart.''
	   Prosecutor Pierre Prosper responded calling the former mayor a
predator and asked for seven life sentences plus additional lesser
sentences for other crimes.
	   Life in prison is the maximum penalty the U.N. tribunal can
impose.
	   The sentencing was the tribunal's second after ex-Prime Minister
Jean Kambanda, 42, pleaded guilty in May and was sentenced to life
on Sep. 4.

European bank approves loan to Papua New Guinea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with budget figures, corrects and more clearly
identifies bank &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The Papua New Guinea
government has secured a U.S. dlrs 60 million (140 million kina)
loan from the Belgian financial group KBC Bankassurance NV to
support its struggling economy.
	   The loan will go toward funding Papua New Guinea's 1998 budget.
	   An additional loan of U.S. dlrs 60 million from a syndicate of
banks led by KBC may be approved soon, Prime Minister Bill Skate
and Treasurer Iairo Lasaro said in a joint statement.
	   ``We should know by next week on the status of the second loan,
but for now I can confirm the initial loan of U.S. dlrs 60 million,
or 140 million kina, has been approved,'' Lasaro said.
	   The government has been forced to seek credit from commercial
banks after so far failing to secure loans from the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund.
	   Last month, it requested a credit rating from Moody's Investor
Service and Standard and Poor's credit ratings agency, but hasn't
yet announced any plans to issue debt.
	   By some estimates, the government has budgeted to receive U.S.
dlrs 190 million from the IMF and World Bank in 1998, but so far
hasn't received any of those funds.
	   The government announced in August a series of economic measure
to boost the ailing kina and said its budget deficit would widen to
2 percent of gross domestic produce from a forecast 1.2 percent.
	   Lasaro and government officials will travel to Washington next
week to continue talks with the World Bank and the IMF.
	   Lasaro told parliament this week that securing the loan from KBC
was critical to the funding of the 1998 budget.
	   This was because even if the World Bank and the IMF did agree to
a lending package, the money would not be available until next
year, he said.
	   The World Bank has refused to provide economic aid to Papua New
Guinea while former bank economist Pirouz Hamidian-Rad works for
Skate.
	   Aside from declining orders for export products such as timber
and minerals blamed on the Asian financial crisis, the Papua New
Guinea budget is under pressure from the effects of the worst
drought in 100 years and the costs inflicted by a tsunami that
struck the north coast in July.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sakura Bank Ltd. said Friday it is discussing a
possible joint venture with Germany's Deutsche Bank AG to manage
mutual funds, the latest large Japanese bank to look abroad for
help in weathering deregulation at home.
	   Sakura said, however, that the tie-up with Deutsche Bank is just
one option and no concrete decision has been made.
	   Sakura also wants mid-sized Japanese brokerage Kokusai
Securities Co. to join the venture, Kyodo News reported.
	   Japanese banks have been scrambling to sharpen their asset
management skills as the country's ``Big Bang'' deregulation drive
brings greater competition between banks, brokerages and fund
managers.
	   On Thursday, Wall Street investment bank J.P. Morgan and Co. and
one of Japan's largest lenders, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., said
Thursday they will set up a Tokyo-based company to manage
investment trusts _ Japan's version of mutual funds.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's jobless rate rose back to a record high of
4.3 percent in August, underscoring the depth of this country's
recession and the increasing severity of employment conditions,
officials said Friday.
	   The number of jobless people reached 2.97 million and the
workforce shrank by 440,000 people to 65.46 million, the statistics
bureau of the Management and Coordination Agency said.
	   It was the seventh-straight month of contraction for the number
of employed compared with year-earlier levels, the agency said.
	   Shortly after the figures were released, Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi's administration held its first meeting of a special labor
committee to seek ways to improve the nation's labor contraction
and pull the nation out of its recession.
	   But the head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Taichi
Sakaiya, said the rebound of the jobless rate to tie the record
marked in June shows that the nation's employment conditions are
extremely severe and improvement soon is unlikely.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine export growth slowed
moderately in August to 18 percent compared to a year earlier, with
exports for the month totaling dlrs 2.65 billion, the government
announced Friday.
	   For the first eight months of the year, exports rose 19 percent
from the same period last year to dlrs 19.059 billion, the National
Statistics Office said.
	   Exports in July had risen 21 percent from a year earlier.
	   The slowdown in export growth did not surprise economists.
	   ``It would have been too good to be true to expect the country
to continue posting an average 20 percent monthly growth in exports
given the current situation in the global economy,'' said Ces
Tanchangco, economist at Bank of the Philippine Islands.
	   In the past year, the Asian currency crisis has spread to other
regions, hurting global economic growth prospects, including those
in Japan and the United States, the main export markets of the
Philippines.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Hopes for a post-election recovery
by Cambodia's struggling economy are being dashed by continuing
political instability, according to a report released by an
independent research institute on Friday.
	   The wide-ranging survey of business and labor found a host of
problems: commerce has slowed, prices of staples such as rice are
rising, consumer confidence has continued to languish and
businesses are cutting wages and staff.
	   The survey was conducted in August by the Cambodian Development
Resource Institute and published in its monthly bulletin.
	   After almost two decades of war and failed experiments with
Marxism, Cambodia's shattered economy showed modest signs of
recovering after United Nations-sponsored elections in 1993
produced a coalition government.
	   But those gains were lost after co-Prime Minister Hun Sen
deposed his counterpart Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a bloody coup
d'etat in 1997, the report said.
	   The political violence and instability paralyzed economic
growth, foreign investment and aid.
	   On July 26, Cambodians voted in a national election that many
hoped would end the bitter rivalry between Hun Sen and Ranariddh.
	   But the results only brought new strife.
	   Market vendors told CDRI that sales are still 48 percent lower
than they were before the coup. Inflation for the year was
estimated at 13 percent, with food prices skyrocketing during and
after the election, the report said.
	   The price of rice, the staple of the Cambodian diet, had risen
27 percent compared to a year ago.
	   Most large businesses, especially in the tourism sector,
reported reductions in staff and salaries. Tourist arrivals are
down 50 percent for the year, and hotel occupancy rates are down
between 10 and 20 percent.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Workers at Philippine Airlines have
voted by a wide margin to accept a management-proposed recovery
plan that will allow Asia's oldest carrier to reopen, officials
said Friday.
	   About 61 percent of ballots cast by members of PAL's largest
union supported the plan, officials said. Under the proposal,
workers will accept a 10-year suspension of their collective
bargaining agreement in exchange for 20 percent of the company's
stock and seats on its board.
	   It was the second time that the 6,700 members of PAL's largest
union have voted on the rescue plan. Last week, they rejected the
proposal, forcing the airline to shut down and leaving much of the
country without air service.
	   Turnout for the second referendum was heavy, with about 80
percent of the union voting. Last week, less than half cast
ballots.
	   ``It's overwhelming,'' said President Joseph Estrada. ``It's
democracy in action. The people have spoken.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's Central Bank on Friday
confirmed what most people already know. There is no hope of
avoiding a recession in 1998.
	   Central Bank Governor Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman said the economy
will not be able to offset the contractions posted in this year's
first two quarters, the national news agency Bernama reported.
	   The economy contracted 2.8 percent in the first quarter and 6.8
percent in the second. Independent analysts say the economy is
likely to shrink by 5 percent for all of 1998.
	   Ali Abul said he was confident that growth would resume
following capital control and other economic measures taken early
last month. He didn't, however, specify when.
	   Malaysia recently moved away from the tight monetary policy
followed by its former finance minister and deputy prime minister,
Anwar Ibrahim. Anwar is now in jail facing 10 counts of corruption
and homosexual acts, charges he says were brought because he
opposed Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule.
	   Mahathir took over as Malaysia's finance minister after firing
Anwar on Sept. 2.
	   Now, with softer lending rules and a policy that allows banks to
use more of their reserves, the economy is flooded with cash.
Interest rates are down, but it remains unclear whether people are
borrowing more.

Dollar drops in Tokyo, Japanese stocks close mixed

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Friday on
speculation that finance officials from leading economies may
declare support this weekend for a stronger Japanese currency.
Tokyo stock prices closed mixed.
	   The dollar bought 134.78 yen in late afternoon trading, down
1.50 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York level of 135.63 yen overnight.
	   ``There aren't many reasons to buy the dollar now,'' said Ryohei
Muramatsu, foreign exchange manager at Commerzbank in Tokyo.
	   Currency dealers were reluctant to buy dollars for yen before
the meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group
of Seven industrialized countries in Washington over the weekend,
traders said.
	   Despite denials by Japanese officials, some traders speculate
that the G-7 could issue a statement designed to counter the yen's
recent weakness against the dollar.
	   The U.S. currency also was weighed down by concern over a
two-day drop in stocks traded on Wall Street and expectations that
the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank may continue to cut interest rates in
the coming months, which would make American bonds less attractive
investments, traders said.
	   ``With investors shrinking their overseas exposure, there is
strong demand for the yen,'' said Seiji Masumoto, a dealer at
Nippon Trust and Banking.
	   In Tokyo trading, the dollar sank as low as 134.50 and traded as
high as 135.88.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average advanced slightly, but the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index
of all issues listed on the first section declined.
	   The Nikkei average rose 26.57 points, or 0.20 percent, closing
at 13,223.69. Earlier in the day, it had slipped below 13,000 for
the first time since January 1986. On Thursday, the index lost
209.27 points, or 1.56 percent.
	   The broader index lost 1.70 points, or 0.17 percent, closing at
1,014.02. It had fallen 27.85 points, or 2.61 percent, the previous
day.
	   Traders said investors worried about prospects for profit growth
at exporting companies in the wake of Wall Street's slide. But this
was offset by hope that key banking bills will be passed quickly
and that trading partners at the weekend G-7 meeting will urge
Japan to boost growth.
	   ``People are hopeful of what might happen over the weekend,''
said Louis Tseng, head of derivatives trading in the Tokyo office
of Jardine Fleming Securities Co.
	   In early trading, stocks sank in reaction to the Dow Jones
industrial average's 210.09 point, or 2.7 percent, drop on Thursday
to a close of 7,632.53. Wall Street had suffered a similar setback
the previous day.
	   Losses were stemmed, however, by apparent buying by public funds
targeting Japanese stock futures, traders said.
	   Gains exceeded declines 606 to 547, with 155 issues closing
unchanged. An estimated 515 million shares changed hands on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 601.1 million
Thursday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.715 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.720 percent,
driving its price up to 109.84 yen from 109.79 yen.

Ex-Rwandan mayor sentenced to life imprisonment for genocide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A U.N. court on Friday ordered a former
Rwandan mayor to serve three life sentences for convictions of
genocide and crimes against humanity, plus 80 years for other
violations including rape, a private news agency said.
	   In the first judgment by an international court on genocide,
Jean-Paul Akayesu was convicted Sept. 2 of nine counts of genocide,
crimes against humanity and rape.
	   Akayesu had made an impassioned plea Monday for forgiveness from
the Rwandan people for the genocide of more than 500,000 people,
mostly minority Tutsis, in 1994.
	   However, Judge Laity Kama said Friday Akayesu ``chose to
participate in the genocide,'' and should therefore spend the rest
of his life in prison, according to the Swiss-based Hirondelle news
agency.
	   ``The chamber is of the opinion... that genocide constitutes the
crime of crimes,'' Kama told the court. ``The sentences should be
served concurrently and therefore (the chamber) sentences Akayesu
to (what amounts to) a single sentence of life.''
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was formed in
Nov. 1994, just months after an extremist Hutu government sponsored
the 90-day slaughter of Tutsis. The genocide ended only when
Tutsi-led rebels from Uganda took power in July the same year.
	   Akayesu was the mayor of the central village of Taba where 2,000
Tutsis who sought his help were killed. He has maintained his
innocence, claiming he was unable to stop the slaughter.
	   Acting in his own defense during his pre-sentencing hearing
Monday, Akayesu said remorsefully ``I regret what happened from the
bottom of my heart.'' He also asked for God's forgiveness,
Hirondelle reported.
	   Prosecutor Pierre Prosper responded calling the former mayor a
predator and asked for seven life sentences plus additional lesser
sentences for other crimes. Akayesu was also the first man to ever
be found guilty by an international tribunal for rape.
	   On Tuesday, Akayesu filed papers appealing his convictions,
Hirondelle reported.
	   Life in prison is the maximum penalty the U.N. tribunal can
impose.
	   The sentencing was the tribunal's second after ex-Prime Minister
Jean Kambanda, 42, pleaded guilty in May and was sentenced to life
on Sep. 4.
	   At the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in The Hague, two men have
received sentences, but neither was for genocide.
	   All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials
pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination. The
trials predated the establishment of the crime of genocide 50 years
ago.

Taiwan shares plunge over fears about conglomerate's health
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The Taiwan stock market's main index
plunged nearly 4 percent Friday on nervousness over news of a
conglomerate's financial problems.
	   The Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange closed
down 266.06 points, or 3.96 percent, at 6,346.00, hurt by fears
that the U-Land Group's cash shortages were just a hint of the
troubles from an economic slowdown.
	   U-Land announced Thursday its construction and textile
businesses had bounced checks of 140 million Taiwan dollars (U.S.
dlrs 4 million).
	   The group, which has accumulated debt of almost 10 billion
Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 289 million), has asked for a week to put
together a bailout package from banks and investors.
	   U-Land Air Lines, also operated by the group, suspended
operations all day Thursday, but resumed flights Friday.
	   Officials of the 3-year-old airline said they will proceed with
buying a key stake in Air Philippines, but may sell off its four
planes to help with a bailout, the United Evening News reported.
	   Construction on U-Land housing developments in central Taiwan
came to a standstill. Shares of U-Land-owned King Textile fell by
the daily permitted maximum of 7 percent, dragging textile stocks
down 4 percent.
	   Adding to bearishness in the market was the overnight plunge in
U.S. stock markets. Electronics companies, largely dependent on
sales in the United States, tumbled 3.2 percent as a sector.
Financial shares also fell 3.7 percent.
	   High-flying U-Land was started by brothers Chou Chi-jui and Chou
Chi-chang just 10 years ago, and grew into a small regional group
with investments in the Philippines and Vietnam.
	   They launched U-Land Air Lines in 1995 with a flamboyant 1
Taiwan dollar (2 U.S. cents) fare offer that quickly put them on
the airline map, but left them with a pile of debt that has
continued to grow.
	   While Taiwan's economic performance has been outstanding amid
the Asian economic crisis, many companies have been hit by a loss
of regional markets.

attack
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Belgrade inviting U.N. secretary general; trims.
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off threatened NATO
attacks, Yugoslavia's Serb leadership on Friday invited the U.N.
secretary general to visit, saying that would help him understand
``the real situation in Kosovo.''
	   The invitation, carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency came
only days before Secretary General Kofi Annan is scheduled to
submit a report on compliance with a U.N. Security Council
resolution, essentially demanding an end to the Kosovo offensive by
Serbian police and the Yugoslav army. And it threatens unspecified
further action if the demand is ignored _ a condition seen by some
NATO countries as opening the door to military intervention.
	   On Thursday, Britain and the United States failed to convince
the Russians and Chinese to specifically blame the Serbs for the
killings at another U.N. Security Council meeting. The council
instead strongly condemned the massacres and called on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to punish those responsible.
	   In another sign of the complexity facing those searching for an
end to the crisis, ethnic Albanian guerrillas said they did not
intend to abandon their battle for independence in the majority
Albanian province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Attacks by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army against police and
soldiers led Milosevic to launch the crackdown Feb. 28.
	   In the nearby Albanian capital Tirana, rebels claimed they
killed 25 police and soldiers Wednesday near the border village of
Junik as the first step in a campaign to ``strike the enemy where
he feels most secure.''
	   The Yugoslav army Thursday confirmed the rebel attack but put
its losses at six dead and seven wounded.
	   In Washington, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said
his government was willing to have international experts take part
in an investigation into the massacres to ``establish and prove the
facts.'' The Foreign Ministry in the capital Belgrade said
invitations went out to forensic experts from Finland. Serb police
have denied responsibility for murdering civilians.
	   The Serbs also announced the withdrawal of combat forces from
battlefields in Kosovo. But ethnic Albanian sources claimed
fighting continued Thursday along the border with Albania, where
separatist guerrillas take sanctuary.
	   Despite the Yugoslav offer, Robert Gelbard, the U.S. envoy to
the Balkans, said the massacres have left the Belgrade government
with ``no credibility at all.''
	   ``We have seen atrocities piled on atrocities,'' Gelbard told
the British Broadcasting Corporation. ``Our people in Kosovo ...
have verified that these atrocities have occurred, that these
latest atrocities that occurred piled on top of previous ones.''
	   Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, told his governing
Labor Party that, ``we don't want to use force'' but warned
Milosevic ``that if it will take force, Britain is ready to back
force.''
	   In the latest allegation, Human Rights Watch said a
self-described survivor of one massacre supplied chilling new
details of alleged atrocities.
	   Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch said a wounded Albanian
reported that he and 13 other men were beaten and shot by Serb
police Saturday. He was the only survivor.
	   Bouckaert said the survivor's story was corroborated by other
witnesses from Golubovac, a village five kilometers (three miles)
from Donje Obrinje, site of another massacre.
	   Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo support independence, although
Western nations do not, fearing that could further destabilize the
Balkans.
	   In Washington, the State Department urged Americans in
Yugoslavia to consider leaving. Spokesman James Rubin said military
action is closer to a reality ``because of Belgrade's failure to
comply with the requirements of the international community.''
	   Meanwhile, the Clinton administration began laying the
groundwork in Congress for possible new NATO air strikes against
Serb military positions. Clinton dispatched his national security
team Thursday to Capitol Hill to brief lawmakers. Senate Democratic
leader Tom Daschle suggested military action ``may be required.''
	   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said the United States and its NATO
allies should prepare to launch an air campaign.
	   ``With the onset of winter only weeks away, a humanitarian
catastrophe looms,'' Biden said in a speech to a foreign-policy
group. ``The stability of the entire southern Balkans hangs in the
balance.''

Prosecutor's reassignment raises questions about anti-corruption

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ They called him the ``Bear'' for his tough-guy
style and relentless campaign against government corruption.
	   But after he rattled the cage of Japan's mighty Finance
Ministry, Tokyo public prosecutor Katsuhiko Kumazaki was abruptly
``promoted'' to an assignment on the sleepy Japan Sea coast.
	   Kumazaki's reassignment three months ago has led many to wonder
whether the powers that be have decided the investigation he was
leading had gone far enough.
	   ``Mr. Kumazaki dared to go where his predecessors had never
gone,'' said Nobuto Hosaka, a lawmaker who has been trying to get
an ethics bill through Parliament. ``But the investigation was left
unfinished.''
	   Kumazaki's investigation into the Finance Ministry was
remarkable both because it was previously believed to be
untouchable and because he went after a form of bribery overlooked
in the past _ expensive golf outings, dinners and trips used to woo
bureaucrats.
	   Virtually unchecked, the wining and dining of bureaucrats had
clearly gotten out of hand.
	   One finance official allegedly accepted entertainment worth dlrs
22,000. Another was accused of frequenting a restaurant where
waitresses wear skimpy outfits with no panties and must reach up
for glasses, hiking up their skirts. The cost of the entertainment
was on the expense accounts of businessmen he was charged with
overseeing.
	   Kumazaki's investigation led to the arrests of four senior
Finance Ministry officials and a top official at the Bank of Japan,
the nation's central bank.
	   Two bank inspectors were recently found guilty. Other verdicts
are pending.
	   The investigation has not been officially closed, but few
experts expect much more to come of it. Since Kumazaki left Tokyo,
there have been no major developments.
	   ``The investigation was crushed,'' said Makoto Sataka, a writer
and expert on economic affairs, who, like others, believes Kumazaki
was transferred to end it.
	   The wining-and-dining scandal was especially embarrassing
because it came as the Finance Ministry was under fire for allowing
top banks to get bogged down in massive bad loans. The debt crisis
is a major factor behind Japan's current economic woes.
	   Prosecutors in Japan are not elected and generally keep a low
profile. But Kumazaki, 56, was unusual.
	   Though not a household name, his accomplishments were well
known. Among the cases he handled were two of the biggest
corruption cases of the last two decades_ one ended the career of
one of Japan's most powerful politicians, the other contributed to
the fall of a prime minister.
	   Prosecutors refuse to comment on the reasons behind Kumazaki's
transfer.
	   Personnel decisions in Japan tend to be tightly orchestrated,
following rules of seniority rather than individual performance.
Kumazaki's career is hardly over _ he now leads a regional
prosecutors' office, and has by no means fallen off the escalator
to the top.
	   Kumazaki has kept silent _ when asked for comment, he said
through his office that it is too soon to be giving interviews.
	   The Finance Ministry, for its part, has punished more than 100
officials with pay cuts, reprimands and one dismissal.
	   ``There is a great deal of interest in the health of our economy
and the stability of our financial system,'' the ministry said.
``It is a serious problem for the national interest that the
Finance Ministry's ability to function is hampered by a scandal.''
	   But while some of the furor over the Finance Ministry has died
down, the parade of scandals continues elsewhere.
	   The latest is at the Defense Agency, where officials are
suspected of overpaying a manufacturer for military equipment in
exchange for plush jobs after retirement.
	   Among the public, it's an all too familiar story.
	   ``People in high places hang on to their old ways,'' said
Mitsuko Tanaka, a 57-year-old marketing researcher. ``Scandals are
going to continue, one after the other.''

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Debt-laden Philippine Airlines said
Friday it will reopen next week after its workers voted by a wide
margin to accept a management-proposed recovery plan.
	   About 61 percent of ballots cast by members of PAL's largest
union supported the plan, officials announced.
	   Under the proposal, workers will accept a 10-year suspension of
their collective bargaining agreement in exchange for 20 percent of
the company's stock and seats on its board.
	   PAL said it can resume flights to 14 domestic destinations next
Wednesday and its international operations several weeks later.
	   ``It's all systems go,'' said senior vice president Avelino
Zapanta. ``We're very happy about this development.''
	   It was the second time that the 6,700 members of PAL's largest
union had voted on the rescue plan. Last week, they rejected the
proposal, forcing the airline to shut down and leaving much of the
country without air service.
	   Turnout for the second referendum was heavy, with about 81
percent of the union voting. Last week, less than half cast
ballots.
	   ``It's overwhelming,'' said President Joseph Estrada. ``It's
democracy in action. The people have spoken.''
	   Estrada assured workers that he will defend their rights during
the 10-year bargaining agreement suspension.
	   ``I'm willing to protect them at all costs. That I can assure
them, they have nothing to fear,'' he said.
	   The union had been split over the proposal, with militant
members saying a suspension of the bargaining agreement would
violate workers' rights.
	   On Thursday, PAL chairman and chief stockholder Lucio Tan asked
all of the airline's executives to submit resignations so that any
new investors could have a free hand in the company's management.
	   PAL has been ravaged by strikes and Asia's currency crisis. It
says creditors and investors have insisted on a suspension of the
union's bargaining agreement to ensure labor harmony before they
accept a restructuring of the company's finances.
	   Many union members had believed the government would not allow
the 57-year-old flag carrier to close. But when government-enlisted
foreign carriers began flying some domestic routes Monday, union
leaders reversed their position and agreed to accept the management
plan.
	   The agreement must be formally endorsed by workers, regulators
and PAL's creditors.
	   Zapanta said at least 2,000 workers will be recalled to handle
domestic operations, and most of the airline's 8,600 current
workers will be recalled once international flights are fully
operational, which he expects by Nov. 15.
	   Asia's currency crisis hit shortly after PAL launched a dlrs 4
billion modernization program, greatly inflating the amount of
money it must repay to overseas creditors. It has been unable to
make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of debt.
	   Two foreign carriers, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific and Dragon
Airlines, are flying some domestic routes to help fill the vacuum
left by PAL's closure.

Yugoslavia offers new cooperation in effort to stave off NATO

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Belgrade inviting U.N. secretary general; trims &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off threatened NATO
attacks, Yugoslavia's Serb leadership on Friday invited the U.N.
secretary general to visit, saying that would help him understand
``the real situation in Kosovo.''
	   The invitation, carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency came
only days before Secretary General Kofi Annan is scheduled to
submit a report on compliance with a U.N. Security Council
resolution, essentially demanding an end to the Kosovo offensive by
Serbian police and the Yugoslav army. And it threatens unspecified
further action if the demand is ignored _ a condition seen by some
NATO countries as opening the door to military intervention.
	   On Thursday, Britain and the United States failed to convince
the Russians and Chinese to specifically blame the Serbs for the
killings at another U.N. Security Council meeting. The council
instead strongly condemned the massacres and called on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to punish those responsible.
	   In another sign of the complexity facing those searching for an
end to the crisis, ethnic Albanian guerrillas said they did not
intend to abandon their battle for independence in the majority
Albanian province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Attacks by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army against police and
soldiers led Milosevic to launch the crackdown Feb. 28.
	   In the nearby Albanian capital Tirana, rebels claimed they
killed 25 police and soldiers Wednesday near the border village of
Junik as the first step in a campaign to ``strike the enemy where
he feels most secure.''
	   The Yugoslav army Thursday confirmed the rebel attack but put
its losses at six dead and seven wounded.
	   In Washington, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said
his government was willing to have international experts take part
in an investigation into the massacres to ``establish and prove the
facts.'' The Foreign Ministry in the capital Belgrade said
invitations went out to forensic experts from Finland. Serb police
have denied responsibility for murdering civilians.
	   The Serbs also announced the withdrawal of combat forces from
battlefields in Kosovo. But ethnic Albanian sources claimed
fighting continued Thursday along the border with Albania, where
separatist guerrillas take sanctuary.
	   Despite the Yugoslav offer, Robert Gelbard, the U.S. envoy to
the Balkans, said the massacres have left the Belgrade government
with ``no credibility at all.''
	   Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, told his governing
Labor Party that, ``we don't want to use force'' but warned
Milosevic ``that if it will take force, Britain is ready to back
force.''
	   In the latest allegation, Human Rights Watch said a
self-described survivor of one massacre supplied chilling new
details of alleged atrocities.
	   Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch said a wounded Albanian
reported that he and 13 other men were beaten and shot by Serb
police Saturday. He was the only survivor.
	   Bouckaert said the survivor's story was corroborated by other
witnesses from Golubovac, a village five kilometers (three miles)
from Donje Obrinje, site of another massacre.
	   Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo support independence, although
Western nations do not, fearing that could further destabilize the
Balkans.
	   In Washington, the State Department urged Americans in
Yugoslavia to consider leaving. Spokesman James Rubin said military
action is closer to a reality ``because of Belgrade's failure to
comply with the requirements of the international community.''

Last appeal of Istanbul's Islamic mayor rejected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ An appeals court on Friday refused to
review the conviction and 10-month-prison term of Istanbul's
Islamic mayor, thus leaving him banned for life from holding public
office.
	   Recep Tayyip Erdogan, seen as the future leader of Turkey's
pro-Islamic Virtue Party, had asked the appeals court to review its
decision last week to uphold the conviction for inciting racial
hatred.
	   The head prosecutor of appeals court rejected his request, the
semi-official Anatolia news agency reported.
	   His sentencing was criticized both by the United States and the
European Union.
	   Turkey is a predominantly Muslim country governed by staunchly
secular laws.
	   The courts convicted Erdogan of inciting racial hatred with a
two-line poem: ``Minarets are our bayonets, domes are our helmets,
mosques are our barracks, believers are our soldiers.''

Philippine stock index falls 2.6 percent on Wall Street losses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell steeply for a
second day Friday, weakened by Wall Street's overnight losses,
traders said.
	   The peso, however, closed higher against the dollar on the back
of the Japanese yen's gains and weak demand for the U.S. currency.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 31.70 points,
or 2.6 percent, to 1,195.62, adding to a 32.32-point, or 2.6
percent, loss Thursday.
	   Traders said investors continued to cash in gains made early in
the week after Wall Street's second substantial loss.
	   To some extent, a 2 percentage-point increase in banks' reserve
requirements added fuel to the market selldown, said Fitzgerald
Aklan, assistant vice president of Orion-Squire Securities Inc.
	   The higher reserves are expected to siphon off some 22 billion
pesos (dlrs 500 million) from the system, reducing the amount of
funds available for investment in stocks.
	   The central bank raised the reserve requirement to remove excess
liquidity that could be used to speculate in the currency market.
	   Aklan said the stock market is expected to continue to look to
Wall Street for guidance.
	   ``But I think with the way things are right now, we may soon
retest our low for the year,'' he said. The index closed at its
lowest level in 1998 on Sept. 11, at 1,082.18.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 43.876 pesos, down from
Thursday's average of 43.974 pesos. It was last traded at 44.050
pesos, its highest level of the day.
	   A trader with a local bank said the peso was continuing to take
its cue from the yen because of a lack of direction in the domestic
currency market.
	   Transactions were dominated by banks engaged in range-bound
trading, hoping to maximize profits by buying and selling dollars.
	   The central bank's 2 percentage-point cut in its overnight
borrowing rate Friday, to 14 percent from 16 percent, did not have
an impact on currency trading as the news had been discounted by
the market.

Forty meningitis cases registered in Russian region

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Forty people in a northern Russian region, the
majority of them children, have been infected with meningitis over
the past few days, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Friday.
	   Doctors attribute the outbreak of meningitis in the Komi
republic capital Ukhta, some 1,350 kilometers (843 miles) northeast
of Moscow, to poor nutrition, inadequate heating and other
difficult conditions resulting from the region's hard economic
circumstances.
	   Meningitis is an infection of the linings of the brain and
spinal cord.

Police question Suharto's son over bank collapse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police were questioning a son of
former President Suharto on Friday in connection with the collapse
of a bank the son had partly owned.
	   Bambang Trihatmodjo, second son of the autocratic former leader,
``has been summoned as a suspect,'' said Maj. Gen. Da'i Bachtiar,
the police chief of detectives.
	   Bambang's Bank Andromeda was among 14 banks closed last November
for allegedly violating lending limits set by the central bank,
Bank Indonesia.
	   Police are investigating possible violations of banking laws,
and about 160 bankers have come under scrutiny.
	   Bambang was among bankers banned from leaving the country.
	   He arrived at police headquarters in a jeep, accompanied by his
lawyer, O.C. Kaligis.

Dutch stocks plunge following profit warning by bank giant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Prices on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange were sharply lower Friday following Thursday's
profit-warning by banking and insurance giant ING.
	   The 27-share AEX Index traded at 849.65 points, down 46.32
points or 5.2 percent, at 0900 GMT.
	   ING announced Thursday that Asia's financial crisis will cut
more deeply into its profit than first expected.
	   The company, which made the announcement after the close of
trade in Amsterdam, said earnings per share will rise by 15 percent
over the whole of the year, taking net profit to 5.6 billion
guilders (dlrs 3.02 billion ), from 4.11 billion guilders (dlrs
2.22) in 1997.
	   ING shares were down 10.70 guilders (dlrs 5.78), or 13 percent,
to 69.60 guilders (dlrs 37.62).
	   The sharp decline by ING dragged down other financial
institutions. ABN Amro, another banking giant, was at 28.30
guilders (dlrs 15.30), down 1.80 guilders (dlrs .97), or 6 percent.

House set on fire as Bosnian Croats try to prevent return of
</HEADLINE>
Muslims

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A house was set ablaze
overnight in a Croat-controlled village after Muslims chased away
during the war managed to return despite Croat protest, NATO
officials said Friday.
	   A group of Croats blocked the nearby road on Thursday claiming
they fear for their safety with Muslims living nearby, but NATO's
recently deployed antiriot special unit, in action for the first
time in Bosnia, dispersed the crowd.
	   Three soldiers of the unit were slightly injured from rocks the
crowd threw at them, said a NATO spokesman, Maj. Richard
Saint-Louis.
	   The Muslims fled Tasovcici, 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of
Mostar, during Muslim-Croat hostilities in Bosnia in 1993. The
return of some 50 of them was previously agreed between local
Muslim and Croat officials.
	   The returnees already arrived in Tasovcici when a group of
Bosnian Croats blocked the nearby main road that connects Bosnia
with the Adriatic in protest. The house set on fire was supposed to
be used by the returnees as temporary shelter, but was empty
because the Muslims instead spent the night in another dwelling
said U.N. officials.
	   This was the third time that Croats in southern Bosnia tried to
prevent Muslims from returning in the past two weeks. International
officials charged with peace implementation believe such actions
are orchestrated by local Croat hard-liners opposed to provisions
of the Dayton peace agreements mandating freedom of movement and
the right of Bosnians of all ethnic persuasions to settle freely in
the country.

Reactor stopped at Ukraine's Zaporizhia nuclear power plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A reactor was stopped at Ukraine's
Zaporizhia nuclear power plant due to a malfunction in its turbine,
officials said Friday.
	   The cause of the malfunction, which occurred in reactor No. 2
late Thursday, was not immediately clear, said the state nuclear
energy company Energoatom.
	   The accident at Europe's largest nuclear facility was reported
less than a week after the same reactor was restarted following
three days of repairs.
	   The Zaporizhia plant has six Soviet-designed VVER-1000 reactors.
Half of them are currently undergoing repairs.
	   Ukraine has five nuclear power plants, which account for more
than 40 percent of the former Soviet republic's electricity
production.

Chairman of troubled UBS resigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout with Ospel giving detail on LTCM debacle
and analysts' comment; ADDS latest share price. No pick up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The chairman of UBS AG, the Swiss
banking giant that said it will lose 2.2 billion Swiss francs (dlrs
1.61 billion) due largely to its involvement in a troubled private
U.S. investment fund, resigned Friday.
	   In a press release, Mathis Cabiallavetta said ``the conviction
that I can prove my service to the bank with this step moved me to
do this.'' Cabiallavetta declined any ``financial arrangement,''
the bank's chief executive officer Marcel Ospel said.
	   Three other top UBS executives are also leaving, the
announcement said. Ospel wouldn't discuss possible remuneration for
them because of contractual terms.
	   Last Thursday, UBS said it would incur a 950 million franc (dlrs
699 million) write down on its exposure to Long Term Capital
Management, which with other losses will lead to a third quarter
after tax-loss of up to 1 billion francs (dlrs 735 million).
	   An internal inquiry uncovered lapses by responsible managers in
controls and decisions before and after the merger, UBS said. It
found no signs of gross negligence, the bank added.
	   UBS said transactions like LTCM won't reoccur. Ospel called its
LTCM involvement an extremely complex case in which risk was ``very
underestimated.''
	   He said the three executives were aware of that and thus left
the bank, but said Cabiallavetta wasn't aware of all the risks
involved. Ospel said the bank will learn lessons and improve risk
controls.
	   Part of the problem in reconstructing the LTCM case, Ospel said,
was that the fund only updated its partners once a month.
	   For a time, he said, ``we were flying blind.''
	   The transaction with LTCM consisted of an equity investment of
around 270 million dlrs and a complex options structure, he said.
In order to hedge that position UBS bought 800 million dlrs worth
of shares in the fund.
	   For regulatory and accounting reasons, the different legs of the
transaction weren't booked in the same places which is why the
extent of the losses went undetected for a long time, Ospel said.
	   Ospel and interim chairman Alex Krauer said UBS first informed
Swiss federal regulators in early September that market turmoil had
caused the bank problems.
	   Last week, the bank told regulators of its losses' extent and,
later in the week, of the investigation's findings.
	   Krauer, vice-chairman of UBS and also chairman of drug giant
Novartis, told a news conference staff changes wouldn't be enough
to restore confidence in the bank. He regretted the losses but
suggested the negative reaction was ``overdone.''
	   ``We promise to do everything so as to not disappoint,'' he
said, adding that a new chairman would be sought quickly.
	   UBS' management on Monday reassured employees in a memo it
remained sound and that it was investigating.
	   The bank said executives leaving by ``mutual agreement'' include
Felix Fischer, chief risk officer of UBS; Werner Bonadurer, former
co-chief operating office of Warburg Dillon Read; and Andrew
Siciliano, former head of rates at Warburg.
	   After an early rise Friday to 302 francs (dlrs 222) a share,
which dealers said reflected enthusiasm at the management shake-up,
at 0913 GMT UBS shares were back down to 267 francs (dlrs 196).
	   Stock market analysts said Friday more still needs to be done to
convince participants of UBS' long-term profitability, in
particular detailed announcements of what the bank plans to do to
prevent similar mishaps in the future. ``Confidence hasn't been
restored yet,'' said Gerd Ramsperger, analyst at Zuercher
Kantonalbank's brokerage research.

Fish workers stop fishing, plant mangroves for World Fishing Day

	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Traditional Indian coastal
fishermen, fighting to prevent foreign trawlers from decimating
fish stocks, have won support from eight other countries, their
representative said Friday.
	   Xavier Pinto, of the Indian National Fishworkers Forum, expects
groups in all nine countries to take positive action on World
Fisheries Day, Nov. 21, against trawler fishing, which he says is
destroying world fish stocks.
	   ``We believe we are gathering momentum, and we expect people
will begin to understand the issues better'' as more groups join
the movement, Pinto told The Associated Press.
	   India's 800,000 traditional fish workers have declared the day a
fishing holiday and, along with groups in Malaysia and Sri Lanka,
will plant coastal mangrove areas to improve breeding grounds.
	   Pinto said the Indian fish workers' struggle began in response
to a government plan to issue more than 2,600 trawler licenses to
foreign fishing companies. The number was reduced to 33 licenses
after a four-year protest campaign.
	   ``We rely on fishing for our sustenance and our livelihood. Yet
the industrial trawlers cut our nets and even shoot at our people.
We've had six injured in shooting incidents.
	   ``Our fight is to ban industrial fishing, foreign industrial
trawlers, coastal pollution and fishery destruction,'' he said.
	   Industrial trawlers rob fishing communities of their livelihood
around the world, he said.
	   Pinto said the latest coastal threat in India was a move by
British shipper P and O to build a dlrs 15 billion, 30-berth
container ``mega-port'' at Wadhwan, only 75 miles (120 kilometers)
north of the port of Bombay.
	   ``The homes of 2,300 fisher people will be destroyed for this
shipyard, yet there is already a port only 120 kilometers away. It
will take 240,000 acres of land (100,000 hectares), half of it
(currently) in rain forest,'' he said.
	   The fight to halt the port would be taken to the British
Parliament and directly to the company, he said.
	   He said that together with national groups in South Africa,
Senegal, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and
Malaysia, India's fish workers' forum has linked with Greenpeace
International, which has the same aim of a global ban on industrial
trawlers.
	   ``While India is leading this struggle, so many others believe
it's possible for these fleets to be stopped.
	   ``Traditional fishermen know the future will live on what is
left behind,'' said Pinto.
	   Almost two-thirds of the world's 200 commercially important fish
stocks are either overexploited or fished to nearly the limit, the
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization reported in 1997.
	   National Fishworkers Forum Indian president Thomas Kocherry said
last year that 75 percent of the world's fisheries were on the
verge of collapse due to irresponsible fishing practices.

Hong Kong and Austria sign air services agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong and Austria signed an air services
agreement Friday, the government reported.
	   A statement said the agreement was signed by Hong Kong's
secretary for economic services, Stephen Ip, and Austria's state
secretary for foreign affairs, Benita Ferrero-Waldner.
	   At present, Austria's Lauda Air operates two flights a week
between Hong Kong and Vienna.
	   The new air pact provides for the continued development of air
services between the two sides following Hong Kong's reversion to
Chinese rule last year.
	   Hong Kong has signed such air services agreements with 31
countries so far.

expert calls for budget cuts. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Intent on forming a new German government,
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder and his party, the Social
Democrats, opened formal negotiations with the environmentalists
Greens on Friday.
	   Schroeder invited the Greens to be his junior coalition partner
after he defeated Chancellor Helmut Kohl in elections Sunday and
returned the left to power after 16 years.
	   ``We're going to have a nice start today,'' Schroeder said
heading into the talks at the North Rhine-Westphalia state offices
overlooking the Rhine River.
	   The first round of talks were expected to focus on how the new
government would finance its priorities, fighting unemployment and
restoring social welfare benefits trimmed by Kohl's government.
	   The Greens' budget expert, Oswald Metzger, has recommend raising
the tax on gasoline by 26 pfennigs (15 cents) a liter, the
mass-circulation Bild newspaper reported Friday. The party also
wants to delay tax reform until 2000 and do away with an annual
13th month payment to retired government workers, the newspaper
said.
	   At the same time, Metzger warned that economic growth was
leveling off and called for government spending cuts.
	   The 12-member Greens delegation declined to comment going into
the meeting. A small group of protesters gathered near the meeting
sight urged the Greens to ``stop nuclear energy now.''

Milosevic's wife criticizes US
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The influential wife of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic Friday criticized the United States,
comparing it to a ``bellicose giant that picks adversaries who
cannot defend themselves.''
	   Apparently angered by the U.S. pressure on her husband over
Kosovo and possibility of NATO attacks, Mirjana Markovic, in a text
published in the newspaper Politika, accused Washington of taking
the leading role in turning the world against Serbia.
	   Markovic is believed to have considerable influence on Milosevic
and the Yugoslav leader's policies. But Markovic enjoys little
popularity among the public in Yugoslavia, made of Serbia and
Montenegro.
	   ``It has been almost a decade since the Security Council started
bringing resolutions accusing the Serbs for wars and violence in
the Balkans,'' Markovic wrote. ``It has been almost a decade since
the United States have stood behind the policies of the United
Nations.''
	   In her text, apparently meant to be slightly ironic, Markovic
said the United States does not dare clash with ``a big and strong
state, a nation that can fight back, an appropriate adversary.''
	   Instead, Markovic said, the Americans ``declare small and
impoverished states their enemies, bomb them occasionally and
impose sanctions to protect U.S. national interests!''
	   Markovic said the biggest ``cynicism'' of the 20th century has
been U.S. cruise missile attack on a chemical plant in Sudan, ``a
half-hungry African state in which children die of hunger in 1998
as they did at the beginning of the century.''
	   ``How come that this civilization giant of our times does not
get angry and dare clash with someone equal to it?'' she asked.
``Which is the real role of the giant that can get angry and
destroy only the adversary that could fit into his hand?''

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police have arrested a woman on
charges of conducting an abortion on a 16-year-old girl, the

a clinic in the beach resort of Pattaya, 110 kilometers (68 miles)
south of Bangkok, the newspaper said.

confessed to offering abortions at a price of 1,000 baht (dlrs
25.65) for each month the pregnancy had lasted, the newspaper said.

Ukraine hopes to sell strategic bomber parts to Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Despite its decision to scrap 40 Soviet-era
strategic bombers, Ukraine still hopes to sell some parts of the
planes to Russia, a news report said Friday.
	   The Russian government is studying the proposals to purchase
certain units and components from the Tu-95 MC and Tu-160 warplanes
``very carefully,'' Defense Minister Oleksandr Kuzmuk said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Ukraine inherited 19 Tu-160s and 25 Tu-95 MCs after the 1991
collapse of the Soviet Union. The long-range planes, designed to
carry guided missiles with nuclear warheads, are based at two
airfields in the Kiev and Chernihiv regions.
	   Ukraine and Russia have negotiated for years over the possible
sale of the planes, most of which have since deteriorated. Last
spring, the Kremlin said it had made a final decision not to
purchase the planes, which cost Ukraine about dlrs 1.3 million a
year to maintain.
	   Ukraine's Security Council decided in April to liquidate 40
bombers, turn two of them into museum pieces and convert two others
for other, unspecified uses. The United States has pledged to
provide financial and technical aid to help Ukraine destroy the
planes.
	   Earlier this week, a U.S. delegation headed by Assistant
Secretary of Defense Edward Warner observed Ukrainian technicians
pulling out the engine and high-tech components from a T-160, known
in the West as Blackjack, and taking them to storage, the Kyiv Post
newspaper said.
	   The paper said the mission was ``fuming'' because the plane was
dismantled but not fully destroyed, as is the practice in Russia
and Kazakstan.
	   Kuzmuk said that all parts from the planes would be used.
	   He said the warplanes would be liquidated by 2001 under the
START I disarmament agreement _ which was ratified by Ukraine in
1993 _ after the two sides work out technical details.
	   Kuzmuk did not say how much the program would cost, but press
reports have put the U.S. aid figure at dlrs 399.2 million for
warhead-carrying missiles and bombers and another dlrs 7.2 million
to scrap strategic bomber facilities.
	   Ukraine already has fulfilled its pledge to become nuclear-free,
turning over all its nuclear warheads _ which comprised the world's
third-largest nuclear arsenal _ to Russia.

Chairman of troubled UBS resigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Ospel giving detail on LTCM debacle
and analysts' comment; ADDS latest share price. No pick up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The chairman of UBS AG, the Swiss
banking giant that said it will lose 2.2 billion Swiss francs (dlrs
1.61 billion) due largely to its involvement in a troubled private
U.S. investment fund, resigned Friday.
	   In a press release, Mathis Cabiallavetta said ``the conviction
that I can prove my service to the bank with this step moved me to
do this.'' Cabiallavetta declined any ``financial arrangement,''
the bank's chief executive officer Marcel Ospel said.
	   Three other top UBS executives are also leaving, the
announcement said. Ospel wouldn't discuss possible remuneration for
them because of contractual terms.
	   Last Thursday, UBS said it would incur a 950 million franc (dlrs
699 million) charge on its exposure to Long Term Capital
Management, which with other losses will lead to a third quarter
after tax-loss of up to 1 billion francs (dlrs 735 million).
	   An internal inquiry uncovered lapses by managers in controls and
decisions before and after the merger, UBS said. It found no signs
of gross negligence, the bank added.
	   UBS said transactions like LTCM won't reoccur. Ospel called its
LTCM involvement an extremely complex case in which risk was ``very
underestimated.''
	   He said the three executives were aware of that and thus left
the bank, but said Cabiallavetta wasn't aware of all the risks
involved. Ospel said the bank will learn lessons and improve risk
controls.
	   Part of the problem in reconstructing the LTCM case, Ospel said,
was that the fund only updated its partners once a month.
	   For a time, he said, ``we were flying blind.''
	   The transaction with LTCM consisted of an equity investment of
around 270 million dlrs and a complex options structure, he said.
In order to hedge that position UBS bought 800 million dlrs worth
of shares in the fund.
	   For regulatory and accounting reasons, the different legs of the
transaction weren't booked in the same places which is why the
extent of the losses went undetected for a long time, Ospel said.
	   Ospel and interim chairman Alex Krauer said UBS first informed
Swiss federal regulators in early September that market turmoil had
caused the bank problems.
	   Last week, the bank told regulators of its losses' extent and,
later in the week, of the investigation's findings.
	   Krauer, vice-chairman of UBS and also chairman of drug giant
Novartis, told a news conference staff changes wouldn't be enough
to restore confidence in the bank. He regretted the losses but
suggested the negative reaction was ``overdone.''
	   ``We promise to do everything so as to not disappoint,'' he
said, adding that a new chairman would be sought quickly.
	   UBS' management on Monday reassured employees in a memo it
remained sound and that it was investigating.
	   The bank said executives leaving by ``mutual agreement'' include
Felix Fischer, chief risk officer of UBS; Werner Bonadurer, former
co-chief operating office of Warburg Dillon Read; and Andrew
Siciliano, former head of rates at Warburg.
	   After an early rise Friday to 302 francs (dlrs 222) a share,
which dealers said reflected enthusiasm at the management shake-up,
at 0913 GMT UBS shares were back down to 267 francs (dlrs 196).
	   Stock market analysts said Friday more still needs to be done to
convince participants of UBS' long-term profitability, in
particular detailed announcements of what the bank plans to do to
prevent similar mishaps in the future. ``Confidence hasn't been
restored yet,'' said Gerd Ramsperger, analyst at Zuercher
Kantonalbank's brokerage research.

Catalonia's parliament claims right to independence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Catalonia's parliament has passed a
resolution claiming the right to secede from Spain.
	   The largely symbolic bill was passed Thursday night with support
from Catalan President Jordi Pujol's party, a nominal ally of Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar in the national legislature.
	   But Pujol was quick to stress that he and his Convergence and
Union party still respected the Spanish constitution.
	   The bill was sponsored by a Catalan party seeking independence
for Spain's wealthy, industrialized northeast region.
	   The tally was 75 in favor, 15 against and 39 abstentions. Among
those voting against was Aznar's Popular Party. The main opposition
party, the Socialists, abstained.
	   A spokeswoman for Pujol's party said Friday the resolution did
not actually call for independence, but rather reaffirmed what she
called Catalans' right to decide if they want independence.
	   ``It does not say that we should secede,'' said the spokeswoman,
Elisenda Pifarre. ``It asserts the right to ask the Catalan people
if they want to or not, through a referendum.''
	   A commission of the Catalan parliament approved a similar bill
in 1989 but it never passed in the legislature as a whole.
	   Thursday's vote came as Spain focuses on nationalist aspirations
in another important region, the Basque country, where the armed
separatist group ETA declared a ceasefire two weeks ago after three
decades of attacks aimed at carving out an independent homeland.
	   Pifarre insisted that the regional parliament was not competing
with Basques for Spain's attention. Still, she acknowledged,
``Catalan people don't want to be left behind.''

Defense Ministry ordered to pay expenses for Ceausescu's family
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Defense Ministry was ordered to
pay legal expenses for the family of Romania's last communist
dictator after keeping the death certificates of the slain leader
and his wife for nearly a decade, an official said Friday.
	   The children of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu sued the Defense
Ministry in May after a protracted battle to obtain the death
certificates. They received the papers in late September.
	   But the Ceausescus' daughter, Zoe, wanted the ministry to pay
legal expenses because it ``was responsible for this delay.''
	   The Bucharest Court of Appeal agreed, and Thursday ordered the
ministry to pay 500,000 lei (dlrs 55) to the state for legal
expenses.
	   ``We shall go along with the court decision and we will not
appeal the case because the sum is so little,'' Lt. Tiberiu
Fratila, a Defense Ministry official, said by telephone.
	   In December 1989, the Ceausescus were accused of genocide and
undermining the nation's economy. Some 1,000 people died during the
anti-communist uprising as forces loyal to Ceausescu battled with
street protesters.
	   The Ceausescu were tried by a military court and shot by a
firing squad.

Police investigate death of Chinese woman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police said Friday they were
investigating whether the death of a Chinese woman who plunged from
the 13th floor of a Bangkok apartment building was a suicide or
murder.
	   When police responded to a report of what they initially
believed was a suicide, they found three other women from China
locked in a room on the same floor of the building.
	   The women said they had been lured to Thailand by members of a
Chinese gang who then demanded dlrs 3,000 from their families for
their release.
	   Police were searching for four men who allegedly held the women
against their will. Security guards at the building said the men
left shortly before police arrived to inspect the body of Liew Moei
Ju, who police said also had been held by the men.
	   They suspect the kidnappers may have thrown her from the
building. Police did not release the victim's hometown or province.

France will ease repayment of Morocco's debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Friday said that
France will ease repayment of Morocco's foreign debt, which has
become a huge burden for the North African kingdom.
	   Morocco's debt to France is currently about 19 billion French
francs (dlrs 3.3 billion), or about 17.5 percent of the country's
total foreign debt.
	   ``France is determined to remain Morocco's primary economic
partner, its primary investor and its primary financial
supporter,'' Jospin said before talks with Moroccan Prime Minister
Abderrahmane Youssoufi.
	   Jospin, however, provided no details on just what France
intended concretely to do to ease the repayment of the debt.
	   The Moroccan leader said that the debt represented his country's
``most ``our most serious difficulty in continuing our economic,
financial, social and human development.''
	   Morocco's foreign debt constitutes about 58 percent of the
country's gross domestic product.
	   Throughout his visit to France which began Wednesday, Youssoufi
has been pressing for an easing of the debt and Jospin's remarks
came as no surprise.
	   ``France has confidence in the Moroccan economy, as it has
confidence in happy outcome of the democratic process that Mr.
Yousouffi's government is carrying out,'' Jospin said.
	   Youssouffi also said that easing Morocco's debt would help
stimulate foreign investment as well as permit the Moroccan
government to address social priorities.
	   The Moroccan prime minister called for some of the country's
debt to be converted to investment credits and said such a
conversion would be a big boost for the local economy. He also said
easing the debt would help free funds for Moroccan government to
address social priorities.
	   A Socialist, Youssouffi was named prime minister in March by
King Hassan II, breaking three months of political deadlock after
legislative elections that left the country without governing
coalition.

Catalonia's parliament claims right to independence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Catalonia's parliament has passed a
resolution claiming the right to secede from Spain.
	   The largely symbolic bill was passed Thursday night with support
from Catalan President Jordi Pujol's party, a nominal ally of Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar in the national legislature.
	   But Pujol was quick to stress that he and his Convergence and
Union party still respected the Spanish constitution.
	   The bill was sponsored by a Catalan party seeking independence
for Spain's wealthy, industrialized northeast region.
	   The tally was 75 in favor, 15 against and 39 abstentions. Among
those voting against was Aznar's Popular Party. The main opposition
party, the Socialists, abstained.
	   A spokeswoman for Pujol's party said Friday the resolution did
not actually call for independence, but rather reaffirmed what she
called Catalans' right to decide if they want independence.
	   ``It does not say that we should secede,'' said the spokeswoman,
Elisenda Pifarre. ``It asserts the right to ask the Catalan people
if they want to or not, through a referendum.''
	   A commission of the Catalan parliament approved a similar bill
in 1989 but it never passed in the legislature as a whole.
	   Thursday's vote came as Spain focuses on nationalist aspirations
in another important region, the Basque country, where the armed
separatist group ETA declared a ceasefire two weeks ago after three
decades of attacks aimed at carving out an independent homeland.
	   Pifarre insisted that the regional parliament was not competing
with Basques for Spain's attention. Still, she acknowledged,
``Catalan people don't want to be left behind.''

Police release 20 of 24 arrested in connection with alleged plot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Ugandan police have released on bail 20
or the 24 people detained on suspicion of being involved in a plot
to attack the U.S. Embassy and Ugandan targets, police spokesman
Bob Ngobi said Friday.
	   ``They were released on police bond. What normally happens is
that if someone is held for a period of 24 hours, and evidence
against his crimes is not found, he is released according to law,''
he said.
	   Ngobi said the 20 men were released on bail Wednesday. He said
four other men _ all Ugandan Muslims _ are still being detained.
	   ``The 20 were arrested because they knew something about
terrorism. They were released on bond pending further
investigations and will be reporting to police after one week,''
Ngobi said.
	   He declined to give information about when the remaining four
were arrested, where they were being held or when they would appear
in court.
	   Police said late last month that 20 men had been picked up by
Ugandan international security officials working in conjunction
with the FBI.
	   The detentions followed several granade attacks on passenger
buses in Uganda in which 30 people died as well as reports of a
foiled attempt to bomb the U.S. diplomatic mission.
	   Uganda security officials have increased security at all major
government installations and diplomatic missions in the capital.

Iraq demands probe of arms inspectors over ties to Israel, CIA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 15-17 with Iraq denial it has nuclear
weapons; DELETES previous final two grafs to trim; CORRECTS Aziz's
first name in 2nd graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has accused United Nations arms
inspectors of working with foreign intelligence agencies hostile to
the country and demanded a special investigation into the U.N.
commission overseeing the inspections.
	   The government made the accusation in a letter from Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that was
reported Thursday night on Iraqi state television and quoted in
Friday's Iraqi dailies.
	   The Iraqi action follows reports in Israeli and American
newspapers quoting former arms inspector Scott Ritter as saying he
dealt with Israeli intelligence and the CIA in seeking information
on Iraq's weapons program.
	   In his letter Aziz urged an official investigation on the U.N.
Special Commission's ``connections and intelligence work that is
hostile to Iraq.''
	   The letter added such a step was necessary to ``guarantee the
United Nations' credibility, neutrality, and reputation.''
	   The Iraqi government has long maintained that some of the arms
inspectors were spies, Ritter in particular, and that the U.N.
Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, was not a neutral agency but
worked under the thumb of the United States.
	   The arms inspectors have the job of certifying that Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step under
U.N. resolutions before the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait can be lifted.
	   Referring to Ritter's quoted comments, Aziz' letter said ``these
statements show serious facts of which Iraq has warned several
times.''
	   ``UNSCOM, which works in the name of the U.N. Security Council
... is firmly connected with the intelligence agencies of states
that pursue anti-Iraq policies,'' the letter said.
	   ``The main source of information UNSCOM uses to peddle its false
claims, to carry out exposed espionage on Iraq, and to fabricate
crises, are U.S. and Israeli sources,'' Aziz said in the letter.
	   He added that ``the statements by Scott Ritter clearly show that
UNSCOM had not only collected information, but studied with the
U.S. and Israeli intelligence services ways to carry out its work
in Iraq.''
	   Iraq has long maintained that it has fulfilled its obligation
under U.N. resolutions, but the arms inspectors say the government
of President Saddam Hussein continues to hide weapons and the means
to make more.
	   Ritter, who resigned in an angry letter on Aug. 26, has since
spoken out several times on Iraq's weapons programs, maintaining
the United States and Britain did not stand behind UNSCOM as it
tried to do its job.
	   On Thursday, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the chief weapons
inspector, Richard Butler, had criticized Ritter for making public
details about Iraq's weapons programs. Butler wrote a letter to
Ritter accusing him of violating his U.N. contract by speaking to
the press, Eckhard said.
	   One of Ritter's statements, made in congressional testimony, was
that Iraq has built at least three bodies for nuclear bombs and is
only lacking uranium to complete the nuclear weapons.
	   On Thursday, an Iraqi official repeated Iraq's denial that it
has developed nuclear devices.
	   ``The International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations
know that Iraq does not have nuclear weapons, nor other weapons of
mass destruction,'' said Abdel Ghani Abdel Ghafour, member of the
regional command of ruling Baath Party.

Many Asian markets dip on concern over Wall Street's losing streak
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES market figures thruout; ADDS 5th and 14th graf analyst
quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Many Asian markets drifted lower Friday as cautious
investors withdrew funds following a second day of losses exceeding
200 points in Wall Street's key stock index.
	   Taking a cue from the downturn in New York, equity markets all
around the Pacific rim opened lower amid growing concern over the
possibility of a worldwide economic slump. Some rebounded in late
trading, but many others ended the week with additional losses.
	   In Europe, meanwhile, London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was down 140.9 at 4,767.3 in midmorning trading.
	   Singapore's Straits Times Index fell 16.03 points, or 1.8
percent, to 899.99 on global recession fears triggered by the Dow
Jones industrial average's two-day tumble, traders said.
	   ``I suppose it's not unexpected given what's happened on Wall
Street and the other markets,'' said Yang Sy Jian, chief economist
at Kay Hian Research in Singapore.
	   The Dow, which had plunged 237.90 points Wednesday, dropped
another 210.09 points, or 2.7 percent, on Thursday, closing at
7,632.53.
	   The selling spree, sparked by worries about shrinking corporate
profits and fears of new financial crises, left the Dow 18.3
percent, or more than 1,700 points, below the all-time high of
9,337.97 reached July 17.
	   The closely watched stock average slid 12.4 percent in the third
quarter, which ended Wednesday _ its worst quarterly performance in
eight years. The Dow is now 3.5 percent below where it began this
year.
	   Sinking stock prices in New York have kindled doubts about
whether top-flight Asian manufacturers can rely on strong sales in
the United States to keep their factories humming amid a prolonged
slump in their home markets.
	   But some Asian markets shook off early declines triggered by the
slide in New York overnight, recovering lost ground and finishing
on an upbeat note.
	   In Tokyo, Japan's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average dipped below
13,000 for the first time since January 1986 before reversing
course and closing up 26.57 points, or 0.20 percent, at 13,223.69.
	   Still, investors dumped shares of blue-chip Japanese exporters.
Home electronics manufacturer Sony Corp. dropped 7 percent to 8,320
yen (dlrs 61.73) and tapemaker TDK Corp. plunged almost 11 percent
to 7,720 yen (dlrs 57.28).
	   South Korea's Composite Stock Price Index opened lower, but soon
recovered and closed at 308.25, up 2.61 points.
	   ``We had expected a significant fall today too, but it was not
so bad as we expected,'' said Lee Chu-bum, an analyst at Seoul's
Dongwon Securities Co.
	   In Australia, the All Ordinaries stock index fell 36.9 points,
or 1.4 percent, closing at 2,532.3. Bank shares led the market
lower after the drop in financial shares traded overnight in New
York, but this was partially offset by a rise in mining stocks on
higher gold prices, traders said.
	   Neighboring New Zealand's NZSE-40 capital index lost 26.30
points, closing at 1,668.24 _ its second straight day at a
five-year low.
	   Bourses in Manila and Taipei were similarly hit hard Friday
after sharp declines in the previous day's trading. The 30-share
Philippine Stock Exchange Index retreated 31.70 points, or 2.6
percent, ending the week at 1,195.62.
	   In Taiwan, the Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange
sank 266.06 points, or 3.96 percent, to 6,346.00. Wall Street
worries added to concerns over reports that a local transportation
conglomerate was unable to meet its payment obligations, traders
said.
	   Also affected by worries about the global economy, Indonesia's
JSX Composite Index lost 10.639 points, or 3.9 percent, closing at
263.229.
	   Hong Kong and Shanghai financial markets were closed Friday to
celebrate China's National Day holiday.

Ex-Rwandan mayor sentenced to life imprisonment for genocide

	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A U.N. court on Friday ordered a former
Rwandan mayor to serve three life sentences for convictions of
genocide and crimes against humanity, plus 80 years for other
violations including rape.
	   In the first judgment by an international court on genocide,
Jean-Paul Akayesu was convicted Sept. 2 of nine counts of genocide,
crimes against humanity and rape.
	   Akayesu had made an impassioned plea Monday for forgiveness from
the Rwandan people for the genocide of more than 500,000 people,
mostly minority Tutsis, in 1994.
	   However, Judge Laity Kama said Friday Akayesu ``chose to
participate in the genocide,'' and should therefore spend the rest
of his life in prison, according to the Swiss-based Hirondelle news
agency.
	   ``The chamber is of the opinion ... that genocide constitutes
the crime of crimes,'' Kama told the court. Akayesu was ordered to
serve the sentences concurrently, which means he will serve a
single life sentence.
	   Akayesu stood silently, showing no emotion as the sentence was
read.
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was formed in
November 1994, months after an extremist Hutu government sponsored
the 90-day slaughter. The genocide ended only when Tutsi-led rebels
took power in July 1994.
	   Akayesu, who was born in 1953, was mayor of the central village
of Taba where 2,000 Tutsis who sought his protection were killed.
He has maintained his innocence, claiming he was unable to stop the
slaughter.
	   Acting in his own defense during his pre-sentencing hearing
Monday, Akayesu said remorsefully, ``I regret what happened from
the bottom of my heart.'' He also asked for God's forgiveness,
Hirondelle reported.
	   Prosecutor Pierre Prosper called the former mayor a predator and
asked for seven life sentences plus additional lesser sentences for
other crimes. He later said he was satisfied with Akayesu's life
sentence, the maximum penalty the U.N. tribunal can impose.
	   Akayesu has appealed his convictions, Hirondelle reported.
	   The tribunal, in Akayesu's precedent-setting judgment, had ruled
that rape and sexual violence were brutally wielded as tools of
genocide in Rwanda in 1994. No one accused Akayesu personally of
rape, but many witnesses said he incited the sexual abuse of Tutsi
women. He was sentenced to 15 years for rape.
	   During the 20-month trial, Akayesu fired his defense team three
times, most recently on Monday, and has represented himself on
several occasions.
	   The tribunal is holding 31 people in Arusha. Another person is
in custody in Texas.
	   Friday's sentencing was the tribunal's second. Ex-Prime Minister
Jean Kambanda, 42, pleaded guilty in May and was sentenced to life
imprisonment on Sept. 4.
	   Rwandan courts have tried at least 330 people in the genocide,
and 116 have been sentenced to death. A total of 126,078 people are
imprisoned and awaiting trial, according to the Red Cross.
	   On April 24, the Rwandan government executed 22 genocide
convicts by firing squad, the first executions for the slaughter.
	   At the Yugoslav tribunal, two men have received sentences, but
neither was for genocide.
	   All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials
pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination. The
trials predated the establishment of the crime of genocide 50 years
ago.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off threatened NATO
attacks, Yugoslavia's Serb leadership on Friday invited the U.N.
secretary general to visit, saying that would help him understand
``the real situation in Kosovo.''
	   The invitation, carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency,
came only days before Secretary General Kofi Annan is scheduled to
submit a report on compliance with a U.N. Security Council
resolution, essentially demanding an end to the Kosovo offensive by
Serbian police and the Yugoslav army. And it threatens unspecified
further action if the demand is ignored _ a condition seen by some
NATO countries as opening the door to military intervention.
	   In Pristina, capital of Kosovo province, ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova said Friday NATO military strikes in Kosovo would be
a humanitarian move that would save the Serbian province's majority
Albanian population. He spoke on the heels of a series of reported
massacres of Albanian villagers.
	   ``The most critical issue is to stop the war machine of Belgrade
and to protect the people of Kosovo,'' Rugova told reporters, when
asked about the effectiveness of any eventual air strikes. ``That's
an issue of humanity. Otherwise we will be seeing other massacres
as we've already seen in the past few weeks.''
	   On Thursday, Britain and the United States failed to convince
the Russians and Chinese to specifically blame the Serbs for the
killings at a new U.N. Security Council meeting. The council
instead strongly condemned the massacres and called on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to punish those responsible.
	   In another sign of the complexity facing those searching for an
end to the crisis, ethnic Albanian guerrillas said they did not
intend to abandon their battle for independence in the majority
Albanian province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Attacks by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army against police and
soldiers led Milosevic to launch the crackdown Feb. 28.
	   In Washington, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said
his government was willing to have international experts take part
in an investigation into the massacres to ``establish and prove the
facts.'' The Foreign Ministry in the capital Belgrade said
invitations went out to forensic experts from Finland. Serb police
have denied responsibility for murdering civilians.
	   The Serbs also announced the withdrawal of combat forces from
battlefields in Kosovo. But ethnic Albanian sources claimed
fighting continued Thursday along the border with Albania, where
separatist guerrillas take sanctuary, and Rugova challenged the
claims of pullbacks, saying the government had forces had ``only
changed their tactical position.''
	   He cited a report by the Albanian Human Rights Council which
says more than 1,400 people have been killed since March, more than
100 are missing and 2,000 have been detained. The United Nations
estimates hundreds killed and more than 270,000 homeless, including
more than 50,000 without shelter _ a source of concern ahead of
winter.
	   In Washington, Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior
Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the United
States and its NATO allies should prepare to launch an air
campaign.
	   ``With the onset of winter only weeks away, a humanitarian
catastrophe looms,'' Biden said in a speech to a foreign-policy
group. ``The stability of the entire southern Balkans hangs in the
balance.''
	   He spoke Thursday as the Clinton administration began laying the
groundwork in Congress for possible new NATO air strikes against
Serb military positions. U.S. President Bill Clinton dispatched his
national security team Thursday to Capitol Hill to brief lawmakers.
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle suggested military action
``may be required.''
	   Despite the Yugoslav offer of outside examination of the
massacre reports, Robert Gelbard, the U.S. envoy to the Balkans,
said the massacres have left the Belgrade government with ``no
credibility at all.''
	   ``We have seen atrocities piled on atrocities,'' Gelbard told
the British Broadcasting Corporation. ``Our people in Kosovo ...
have verified that these atrocities have occurred, that these
latest atrocities that occurred piled on top of previous ones.''
	   Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, told his governing
Labor Party that, ``we don't want to use force'' but warned
Milosevic ``that if it will take force, Britain is ready to back
force.''
	   In the latest allegation, Human Rights Watch said a
self-described survivor of one massacre supplied chilling new
details of alleged atrocities.
	   Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch said a wounded Albanian
reported that he and 13 other men were beaten and shot by Serb
police Saturday. He was the only survivor.
	   Bouckaert said the survivor's story was corroborated by other
witnesses from Golubovac, a village five kilometers (three miles)
from Donje Obrinje, site of another massacre.

Iraq demands probe of arms inspectors over ties to Israel, CIA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 15-17 with Iraq denial it has nuclear
weapons; DELETES previous final two grafs to trim; CORRECTS Aziz's
first name in 2nd graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has accused United Nations arms
inspectors of working with foreign intelligence agencies hostile to
the country and demanded a special investigation into the U.N.
commission overseeing the inspections.
	   The government made the accusation in a letter from Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that was
reported Thursday night on Iraqi state television and quoted in
Friday's Iraqi dailies.
	   The Iraqi action follows reports in Israeli and American
newspapers quoting former arms inspector Scott Ritter as saying he
dealt with Israeli intelligence and the CIA in seeking information
on Iraq's weapons program.
	   In his letter Aziz urged an official investigation into the U.N.
Special Commission's ``connections and intelligence work that is
hostile to Iraq.''
	   The letter added such a step was necessary to ``guarantee the
United Nations' credibility, neutrality, and reputation.''
	   The Iraqi government has long maintained that some of the arms
inspectors were spies, Ritter in particular, and that the U.N.
Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, was not a neutral agency but
worked under the thumb of the United States.
	   The arms inspectors have the job of certifying that Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, a necessary step under
U.N. resolutions before the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait can be lifted.
	   ``UNSCOM, which works in the name of the U.N. Security Council
... is firmly connected with the intelligence agencies of states
that pursue anti-Iraq policies,'' the letter said.
	   ``The main source of information UNSCOM uses to peddle its false
claims, to carry out exposed espionage on Iraq, and to fabricate
crises, are U.S. and Israeli sources,'' Aziz said in the letter.
	   He added that ``the statements by Scott Ritter clearly show that
UNSCOM had not only collected information, but studied with the
U.S. and Israeli intelligence services ways to carry out its work
in Iraq.''
	   Iraq has long maintained that it has fulfilled its obligation
under U.N. resolutions, but the arms inspectors say the government
of President Saddam Hussein continues to hide weapons and the means
to make more.
	   Ritter, who resigned in an angry letter on Aug. 26, has since
spoken out several times on Iraq's weapons programs, maintaining
the United States and Britain did not stand behind UNSCOM as it
tried to do its job.
	   On Thursday, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the chief weapons
inspector, Richard Butler, had criticized Ritter for making public
details about Iraq's weapons programs. Butler wrote a letter to
Ritter accusing him of violating his U.N. contract by speaking to
the press, Eckhard said.
	   One of Ritter's statements, made in congressional testimony, was
that Iraq has built at least three bodies for nuclear bombs and is
only lacking uranium to complete the nuclear weapons.
	   On Thursday, an Iraqi official repeated Iraq's denial that it
has developed nuclear devices.
	   ``The International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations
know that Iraq does not have nuclear weapons, nor other weapons of
mass destruction,'' said Abdel Ghani Abdel Ghafour, member of the
regional command of ruling Baath Party.

3-under-par 69 Friday and shared a one-shot lead after the first
round of the 60 million yen (dlrs 441,000) Kosaido Ladies Golf Cup.
	   Takasu sank four birdies against one bogey on the 6,257-yard,

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off threatened NATO
attacks, Yugoslavia's Serb leadership on Friday invited the U.N.
secretary general to visit, saying that would help him understand
``the real situation in Kosovo.''
	   The invitation, carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency came
only days before Secretary General Kofi Annan is scheduled to
submit a report on compliance with a U.N. Security Council
resolution, essentially demanding an end to the Kosovo offensive by
Serbian police and the Yugoslav army. And it threatens unspecified
further action if the demand is ignored _ a condition seen by some
NATO countries as opening the door to military intervention.
	   In Pristina, capital of Kosovo province, ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova said Friday NATO military strikes in Kosovo would be
a humanitarian move that would save the Serbian province's majority
Albanian population. He spoke on the heels of a series of reported
massacres of Albanian villagers.
	   ``The most critical issue is to stop the war machine of Belgrade
and to protect the people of Kosovo,'' Rugova told reporters, when
asked about the effectiveness of any eventual air strikes. ``That's
an issue of humanity. Otherwise we will be seeing other massacres
as we've already seen in the past few weeks.''

Tearful British designer defends use of paraplegic model
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Avant-garde British designer Alexander McQueen was
driven to tears as he defended his use of a handicapped model
during his fashion show in London last weekend, a French newspaper
reported Friday.
	   McQueen has come under fire for having American model Aimee
Mullins, who had her lower legs amputated after she was born
without a fibula, strut the catwalk with prosthetic legs on Sunday
during London Fashion Week.
	   Now the 22-year-old model is trying to evade paparazzi, and
McQueen, whose cousin was maimed in a car accident, is fighting off
critics.
	   ``I wanted to show the beauty that comes from inside,'' McQueen
told Le Figaro. ``Look at the covers of women's magazines: they
only show slim, blonde women, preferably with light skin.
	   ``The vultures imagined I was exhibiting Aimee as a freak
show,'' he said. ``Now, paparazzi are camped in front of her home
to get a miserable scoop. She had to get a hotel room.
	   The 29-year-old designer who revitalized the French fashion
house Givenchy claimed he wanted Mullins' condition to go
unnoticed.
	   ``It was a secret of love,'' he said. ``If you see her walk, you
would understand,'' he said, pausing and sobbing, the newspaper
said. ``She is simply magnificent.''
	   ``One time in her life, she would feel ordinary,'' he said. ``I
had specially designed prosthesis in the form of boots. So what if
they cost me 40,000 francs! (dlrs 7,200)
	   Mullins, a Paralympic medal winner for sprinting, became an
overnight sensation in the British press. ``Disabled model steals
McQueen show,'' headlined the Times.
	   But among McQueen's critics was Pierre Berge, president of the
fashion house Yves Saint Laurent, calling him a
``voyeur-provocateur.''
	   ``That man knows nothing about life,'' McQueen said. ``I'm
personally living a veritable nightmare. My cousin became a
vegetable after a car accident when he was 13 years old. I was
never able to accept the scornful and frightened looks people gave
him.''
	   Asked if he was following in the footsteps of Benetton's latest
clothing ads in Europe using handicapped people, he said: ``For
pity's sake, no!,'' breaking into tears again. ``When will people
understand that I'm acting out of kindness?''
	   ``Benetton uses people dying of AIDS to sell their sweaters,''
he said. ``As a homosexual, I find that disgusting. Like using war
victims from Yugoslavia.''
	   ``I'm not advertising, I'm promoting. Promoting handicapped
people,'' he said. ``I know I'm provocative. You don't have to like
what I do, but at least you can't ignore it.''

 &UR; Doohan fastest in Friday sessions &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: updates with later qualifying, changes headline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHILLIP ISLAND, Australia (AP) _ World champion Mick Doohan held
his rivals at bay Friday to lead qualifying for Sunday's Australian
Grand Prix 500 c.c. motorcycle race.
	   Doohan repelled challenges from arch-rival Max Biaggi of Italy
and American John Kocinski to clock a fiery lap of 1 minute, 33.162
seconds _ almost a full second under his own lap record set last
year.
	   The Australian, who can wrap up a fifth consecutive world title
this weekend, dominated early practice and signaled his intention
to take his first grand prix at the Phillip Island track.
	   Biaggi, his closest challenger in the world championship, made a
dramatic improvement after a sluggish early practice session, when
he could manage no better than 12th place.
	   The Italian's pit crew worked feverishly on the bike's settings
before Biaggi jumped into second place in first qualifying with a
last-gasp lap of 1:33.712.
	   He hinted he could have pushed further.
	   ``The last few laps were difficult because I could see some
raindrops on my screen and that makes it hard to go fast,'' Biaggi
said.
	   Kocinski, who headed the session before being overtaken by a
flying Doohan lap, finished third-quickest on 1:33.789.
	   Defending Australian champion Alex Criville slid to seventh on
the list, while fellow Spaniard Carlos Checa limped in at 13th
after surviving a high-speed crash.
	   Checa lost his Honda on a sweeping turn and tumbled off the
track as bits flew off the bike, but he was up immediately and
suffered no injury.
	   The one variable which bothers Doohan's Honda team is the
changing weather forecast, with intermittent showers due over the
next two days.
	   ``Everything seems pretty good so far, but the problem we've got
is that we don't know what the weather's going to do,'' Doohan
said.
	   ``If it is wet tomorrow, today's going to be really important in
terms of what we did with tires.''
	   Italians had a good day in the smaller classes, with youngster
Marco Melandri setting fastest time in the 125 c.c. class and
Valentino Rossi taking provisional pole by one hundredth of a
second in the 250 c.c. category. (djp)

Workers approve rescue plan; Philippine Airlines to reopen

holding talks with PAL on possible investment, 16th graf &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Debt-laden Philippine Airlines said
Friday it will reopen next week after its workers voted by a wide
margin to accept a management-proposed recovery plan.
	   About 61 percent of votes cast by members of PAL's largest union
supported the plan, officials announced.
	   Under the proposal, workers will accept a 10-year suspension of
their collective bargaining agreement in exchange for 20 percent of
the company's stock and seats on its board.
	   PAL said it can resume flights to 14 domestic destinations next
Wednesday and to nine international destinations within several
weeks.
	   ``It's all systems go,'' said senior vice president Avelino
Zapanta. ``We're very happy about this development.''
	   It was the second time that the 6,700 members of PAL's largest
union had voted on the rescue plan. Last week, they rejected the
proposal, forcing the airline to shut down and leaving much of the
country without air service.
	   Turnout for the second referendum was heavy, with about 81
percent of the union voting. Last week, less than half cast
ballots.
	   ``It's overwhelming,'' said President Joseph Estrada. ``It's
democracy in action. The people have spoken.''
	   Estrada assured workers that he will defend their rights during
the 10-year bargaining agreement suspension.
	   The union had been sharply split over the proposal, with
militant membe to close. But when government-enlisted
foreign carriers began flying some domestic routes Monday, union
leaders reversed their position and agreed to accept the management
plan.
	   The agreement must be formally endorsed by workers, regulators
and PAL's creditors.
	   Zapanta said at least 2,000 workers will be recalled to handle
domestic operations, and most of the airline's 8,600 current
workers will be recalled once international flights are fully
operational, which he expects by Nov. 15.
	   On Thursday, PAL chairman and chief stockholder Lucio Tan asked
all of the airline's executives to submit resignations so that any
new investors could have a free hand in the company's management.
	   Zapanta said Cathay Pacific Airways seems to be the ``most
serious'' among possible investors in PAL. The Hong Kong-based
airline sent a 25-man team Thursday to start talks with PAL, he
said.
	   PAL has been ravaged by strikes and Asia's currency crisis. It
says creditors and investors have insisted on a suspension of the
union's bargaining agreement to ensure labor harmony before they
accept a restructuring of the company's finances.
	   Asia's currency crisis hit shortly after PAL launched a dlrs 4
billion modernization program, greatly inflating the amount of
money it must repay to overseas creditors. It has been unable to
make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of debt.
	   Two foreign carriers, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific and Dragon
Airlines, are flying some domestic routes to help fill the vacuum
left by PAL's closure.

Greek author Lili Zografou dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Lili Zografou, a prolific author whose
work often dealt with Greece's turbulent politics and social
inequities, died Friday. She was 76.
	   Ms. Zografou died at a hospital on her home island of Crete a
week after suffering a stroke, hospital officials said.
	   She first appeared on the literary scene in 1949 with her novel
``Love'' and established her career 10 years later with a highly
praised essay on Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis.
	   Ms. Zografou also worked as a journalist and contributed
articles to a variety of publications.
	   Many of the Zografou's 24 books were deeply laced with political
themes and commentaries on social issues, particularly the status
of women in Greek society.
	   The targets of her political critiques were varied. She
denounced the 1967-74 military dictatorship in books such as ``Your
Wife the Tramp'' (1984) and ``Occupation: Whore'' (1978). But she
also was an outspoken foe of the late Socialist Premier Andreas
Papandreou.
	   Nikos Konstantopoulos, president of political group Coalition of
Leftist Forces, said Ms. Zografou was ``always on the radical
forefront of spiritual and social pursuits ... close to personal
pain and to the unyielding battle for social rights and political
freedom.''
	   Her 1994 book ``Love Was Late One Day,'' a family saga set
during the Italian occupation of Greece in World War II, was made
into a serial for Greek television.
	   Her funeral was planned for Saturday in Crete. She is survived
by a daughter, writer Rena Hatzidaki.

Catalonia's parliament claims right to independence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background on Pujol party's role in national parliament &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Catalonia's parliament has passed a
resolution claiming the right to secede from Spain.
	   The largely symbolic bill was passed Thursday night with support
from Catalan President Jordi Pujol's party, a nominal ally of Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar in the national legislature.
	   But Pujol was quick to stress that he and his Convergence and
Union party still respected the Spanish constitution.
	   The bill was sponsored by a Catalan party seeking independence
for Spain's wealthy, industrialized northeast region.
	   The tally was 75 in favor, 15 against and 39 abstentions. Among
those voting against was Aznar's center-right Popular Party. The
main opposition party, the Socialists, abstained.
	   A spokeswoman for Pujol's party said Friday the resolution did
not actually call for independence, but rather reaffirmed what she
called Catalans' right to decide if they want independence.
	   ``It does not say that we should secede,'' said the spokeswoman,
Elisenda Pifarre. ``It asserts the right to ask the Catalan people
if they want to or not, through a referendum.''
	   A commission of the Catalan parliament approved a similar bill
in 1989 but it never passed in the legislature as a whole.
	   Thursday's vote came as Spain focuses on nationalist aspirations
in another important region, the Basque country, where the armed
separatist group ETA declared a ceasefire two weeks ago after three
decades of attacks aimed at carving out an independent homeland.
	   Pifarre insisted that the Catalan regional parliament was not
competing with Basques for Spain's attention. Still, she
acknowledged, ``Catalan people don't want to be left behind.''
	   Aznar, who was elected in 1996, lacks a majority in the national
legislature, and relies on Pujol's party and the moderate Basque
Nationalist Party to pass bills.
	   The price for that support, set in a post-election deal, was
greater autonomy for those two regions and a bigger slice of the
economic pie.
	   Analysts said the Catalan parliament's vote serves as a reminder
to Aznar that, as he heads toward elections in 2000, he owes his
job to Catalonia.

Greece to send warplanes to Cyprus for military exercises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greece will send warplanes to take part
in next month's military exercises by the Cyprus National Guard as
a way to strengthen the two countries' defense pact, the Greek
defense minister said Friday.
	   Advancing the alliance is necessary because Turkey's hardening
stance means that initiatives by the United States and other
foreign countries to settle the Cyprus problem are pointless, added
the minister, Akis Tzochatzopoulos.
	   His statement comes as the United States is trying to ease
tensions in Cyprus, asking Cyprus to cancel its order for Russian
anti-aircraft missiles and requesting that Greece and Turkey agree
to a flight moratorium over the war-divided island.
	   But Tzochatzopoulos, speaking to reporters at the end of a
three-day visit, said the American efforts for peace were going
nowhere because of Turkish intransigence.
	   ``We have recently seen Turkey not only unwilling to participate
in the U.N. dialogue, but demanding legalization of the illegal
occupation of north Cyprus,'' he said.
	   ``This is why there is no sense in dealing with the various
(foreign) initiatives for a Cyprus settlement as long as Turkish
intransigence not only continues, but grows even more insolent,''
he added.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied its northern third after an abortive coup by supporters of
union with Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north
is only recognized by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Tension has been rising following Turkey's warning it will
prevent the deployment of the Russian S-300 missiles due for
delivery toward the end of the year.
	   Tzochatzopoulos repeated that Greece would respond to any such
Turkish attack by coming to the aid of Cyprus.
	   Cyprus has no air force. In the past Turkey reacted by sending
warplanes of its own to the Turkish-occupied north of the island
whenever Greek warplanes visited the Greek Cypriot controlled
south.
	   Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides has offered to cancel the
missile deployment if Turkey accepts his demilitarization proposal
and a no-flight zone for warplanes over the island, or if there is
progress in U.N.-sponsored talks for reuniting Cyrus.
	   The talks are deadlocked following Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash's demands that his breakaway state must be recognized
before talks resume. He also wants the Cypriot government to cancel
the missile deployment and end talks on joining the European Union.

Cambodia warns U.S. not to interfere in court probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian government has warned
the United States not to interfere in a court investigation of an
opposition politician, according to an internal government memo
obtained Friday.
	   Interior Minister Sar Kheng wrote Thursday to Cambodian leader
Hun Sen that he had met with U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Quinn and
warned the United States not to interfere in a court's attempt to
summon outspoken politician Khem Sokha for questioning about his
role in recent anti-government demonstrations.
	   Hun Sen wrote in response at the bottom of the letter that Khem
Sokha was summoned in connection with a criminal case and that
neither of the governments should be seen as influencing the court.
	   ``Not only can foreign governments not meddle in this affair,
even the Royal Government of Cambodia is unable to block the
proceedings of the court,'' Hun Sen wrote.
	   Cambodia's courts, however, are widely seen as controlled by Hun
Sen and his ruling Cambodian People's Party.
	   The threat of arrests has hung over the heads of opposition
politicians as negotiations continue with the ruling party for the
formation of a new government.
	   In elections July 26, Hun Sen's party won 64 of 122 seats in
parliament, short of the two-thirds needed to form the government
alone.
	   The Phnom Penh municipal court issued a summons last week to
Khem Sokha, former chairman of parliament's human rights
commission, but has been unable to deliver it.
	   Khem Sokha, who has been in hiding for fear of arrest, did not
appear before a judge Thursday as requested in the summons.
	   Municipal Court Judge Mong Moni Chariya said Thursday that Khem
Sokha was summoned in connection with a case being built against
junior opposition leader Sam Rainsy.
	   The court is considering four charges against Sam Rainsy for his
prominent role in demonstrations that called for Hun Sen's ouster
following the elections. The opposition charged that intimidation
and fraud led to his victory.
	   Mong Moni Chariya said the charges include destruction of state
property, incitement of violence and incitement of racial hatred.
	   Sam Rainsy gained immunity from prosecution last week when he
was sworn in as a member of parliament. Khem Sokha, however, failed
to win a second term in the election.
	   Sar Kheng wrote that Quinn told him the U.S. State Department,
U.S. senators and human rights organizations were concerned about
Khem Sokha and that arresting or detaining him could affect
relations between the two countries.
	   Quinn declined Friday to comment on the letter.
	   Two U.S. senators wrote to Hun Sen this week and called on the
Cambodian leader to respect the immunity of opposition members of
parliament. They also warned that they took ``a personal interest''
in the safety of Khem Sokha.

Gunmen target leading lawmaker from Angola's former rebel group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Gunmen fired three shots at close range
into the car of a leading official of the former rebel group UNITA
Friday as his wife and chauffeur prepared to drive off. No one was
injured.
	   Abel Chivukuvuku, UNITA's parliamentary leader, was not in the
car at the time. He claimed the shooting was an assassination
attempt by the government.
	   Gunmen drove past the car, which was parked outside
Chivukuvuku's suburban house, at high speed and fired three 9mm
bullets from a pistol which apparently had a silencer, police said.
	   Two bullets entered through the windshield on the driver's side.
Another went through the car and lodged in the passenger-side door.
	   Chivukuvuku's wife, Toya, and his chauffeur got into the
state-provided Daewoo car at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT), the usual time
Chivukuvuku leaves home to go to the National Assembly in downtown
Luanda.
	   His security guards, provided by the government as part of the
1994 peace agreement that ended a two-decade civil war, did not
turn up for work Friday, Chivukuvuku said.
	   Police said they were investigating.
	   Chivukuvuku, who recently has been pressured by the government
to join UNITA dissidents who have broken with the movement's leader
Jonas Savimbi, alleged the shooting was an assassination attempt.
	   ``I usually drive the car. This was an assassination attempt
against me and my family,'' Chivukuvuku told The Associated Press
shortly after the incident.
	   ``But I won't be forced to join the dissidents by gunfire,'' he
said.
	   The incident was the latest jolt to the country's ailing peace
process which is running over a year behind schedule and which has
not advanced since May due to continuing hostility between the
former foes.
	   The governing Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or
MPLA, last month broke off all contact with Savimbi and is keen to
see him internationally isolated.
	   The MPLA has expelled Savimbi's officials from the national
unity government and also wants the groups' lawmakers to join the
breakaway movement.
	   However, most of UNITA's 70 lawmakers, including Chivukuvuku,
have stayed loyal to Savimbi, who lives in the movement's central
highland stronghold Andulo.
	   The government has accused UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, of failing to
comply with the peace pact and keeping an army hidden in the bush.
	   UNITA has refused to relinquish control of its four remaining
central highland strongholds in contravention of the peace accord,
bringing United Nations sanctions against it.

Taiwan shipping firm buys Italy's Lloyd Triestino
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's Evergreen Group said Friday it
has acquired the Italian shipping company Lloyd Triestino Di
Navigazione S.P.A.
	   The Taiwanese conglomerate said it plans to expand the Italian
company's fleet and strengthen its presence in the Mediterranean,
Persian Gulf, India, Australia, New Zealand and Africa.
	   Lloyd Triestino operates eight shipping lines and has a fleet of
seven vessels, an Evergreen statement said.
	   Evergreen, which owns Taiwan's largest shipping company, also
plans to build a dock in the Italian port of Taranto, it said.
	   It did not disclose the value of the transaction.
	   Lloyd Triestino and Evergreen have cooperated on shipping route
operations since 1994.

Greece to send warplanes to Cyprus for military exercises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greece will send warplanes to take part
in next month's military exercises by the Cyprus National Guard as
a way to strengthen the two countries' defense pact, the Greek
defense minister said Friday.
	   Advancing the alliance is necessary because Turkey's hardening
stance means that initiatives by the United States and other
foreign countries to settle the Cyprus problem are pointless, said
Akis Tzochatzopoulos.
	   His statement comes as the United States is trying to ease
tensions in Cyprus, asking Cyprus to cancel its order for Russian
anti-aircraft missiles and requesting that Greece and Turkey agree
to a flight moratorium over the war-divided island.
	   But Tzochatzopoulos, speaking to reporters at the end of a
three-day visit, said the American efforts for peace were going
nowhere because of Turkish intransigence.
	   ``We have recently seen Turkey not only unwilling to participate
in the U.N. dialogue, but demanding legalization of the illegal
occupation of north Cyprus,'' he said.
	   ``This is why there is no sense in dealing with the various
(foreign) initiatives for a Cyprus settlement as long as Turkish
intransigence not only continues, but grows even more insolent,''
he added.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied its northern third after an abortive coup by supporters of
union with Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north
is only recognized by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said Friday he is not too choosy about who will be his successor.
	   The man need not necessarily be very religious and only
preoccupied with doing virtuous deeds at all times, the national
news agency, Bernama, quoted Mahathir as saying after Friday
prayers at the Al-Falah Mosque in the northern town of Jitra in
Kedah state.
	   ``It is sufficient that the person does things acceptable by the
people,'' Mahathir said.
	   So far Mahathir, 72, has designated three heirs-apparent during
his 17-year rule. One resigned. Another challenged Mahathir for
leadership of the ruling party, and lost.
	   On Sept. 2, he fired the last one, Anwar Ibrahim, calling him
morally unfit for office. Anwar mounted a nationwide campaign
against the prime minister before being detained as a national
security risk and charged with illegal homosexual acts and
corruption in connection with those allegations.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES throughout with Yeltsin's spokesman, Central
Bank chief denying intention to ban foreign currency. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Government officials on Friday denied any
intention to ban Russians from buying foreign currency and said
they would decide how to deal with the economic crisis after
consulting with international lenders.
	   Responding to media reports of a government economic plan that
would prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars and other foreign
currency, a Kremlin spokesman said that President Boris Yeltsin is
strongly opposed to such a move.
	   ``That would bring back the Iron Curtain,'' presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko on Friday also
dismissed a proposal to ban the circulation of foreign currency as
a ``mad idea.''
	   He and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov were heading to
Washington later Friday for talks with the International Monetary
Fund.
	   Zadornov met in the morning with leaders of the lower house of
parliament, the State Duma, to discuss how the government planned
to meet its debts to state-funded institutions.
	   Nikolai Kharitonov, head of the Agrarian Party faction, said the
government's crisis program ``is most likely to be composed after
we check our watches with the IMF, that is, when it becomes clear
what we can count on _ only on ourselves or on some outside
support,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Thursday that he might be
forced to take ``unpopular measures'' to salvage the Russian
economy if the IMF didn't come through with more money.
	   Russia has been trying to pressure the lending agency into
releasing the second, dlrs 4.3 billion installment of a loan that
was approved in July, a month before the country's economy crashed
and the government effectively defaulted on its foreign loans.
	   The IMF credit would allow Russia to come out of the crisis
``with minimum losses,'' Primakov said. Without the loan, he added,
``We will take measures _ measures that may be quite unpopular. We
will not throw our country to the winds.''
	   IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to come
up with a sound economic program before the loan is given, and have
made it clear that currency controls and boosting the money supply
by printing rubles are not acceptable. Both options are reportedly
under consideration by the new government.
	   The government is reportedly considering an economic plan loaded
with Soviet-style economic levers such as tight currency controls
and the generous printing of new money. Primakov said that the
plan, which was outlined Thursday in the Kommersant business daily,
is just one of six alternatives his Cabinet was considering.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A cooking gas canister exploded Friday in a
crowded marketplace in a town near Milan, injuring at least 29

Latvian referendum overshadows parliamentary poll
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL TARM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) - Whether to make citizenship easier for the
countrys huge ethnic Russian population is the top issue for most
Latvians when they vote in national elections Saturday.
	   In the third national election since Latvia broke with the
Soviet Union , the electorate will pick a new slate of deputies to
the countrys 100-seat parliament, the Saeima.
	   But it is a referendum being held simultaneously that has drawn
most attention in the voting run-up and which has driven the
election campaigns of most of the 21 parties and alliances seeking
seats.
	   The controversial referendum, if passed, would nullify
amendments adopted earlier this year liberalizing Latvian
citizenship laws, which place high obstacles to 700,000 out of
Latvias 1.2 million ethnic Russians becoming citizens.
	   Non-citizens are not eligible to vote on the referendum or in
the election.
	   After Latvia regained independence in 1991, citizenship was
granted automatically to pre-1940 residents and their descendants _
leaving stateless most of the ethnic Russians who poured into
Latvia in the Soviet era.
	   The citizenship amendments, approved by parliament in June, were
supposed to signal that Latvia was ready to integrate the Russians,
who make up some 45 percent of the country's 2.5 million
population.
	   Western governments have warned of their disapproval if the
citizenship amendments are overturned. The European Union has said
turning down the changes could foil Latvias bid for membership.
	   Russia, which has already denounced Latvian citizenship
policies, is also likely to react angrily if the referendum goes
through.
	   Five of the six parties in Latvias current government coalition
and all the major opposition parties have called on voters to
reject the referendum and allow the amendments to stand, stressing
the potential damage to Latvia's image abroad.
	   The right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party, a member of the
governing coalition and the party of Latvian Prime Minister Guntars
Krasts, is the only major party campaigning for a yes-vote in the
referendum.
	   Fatherland and Freedom argues that by softening naturalization
rules Latvia has caved in to Western pressure. Its main campaign
poster, emblazoned by a maroon and white Latvian flag, reads,
``Latvians: Don't give in!''
	   Many voters are expected to split their votes, casting ballots
for moderate parties in the parliamentary poll, but voting for the
referendum. On the eve of the election, observers said the final
referendum result was still too close to call.
	   On issues other than citizenship, like the need to seek EU and
NATO membership, there is wide cross-party agreement. There is also
broad support for the free-market reforms implemented in the
country with such success in recent years.
	   Voter support for one party or another seems to depend less on
the issues, and more on the personality of different party leaders.
	   The party that has been No. 1 in most pre-election polls with
around 20 percent support is the center-right Peoples Party, a new
party founded by wealthy businessman and a former prime minister,
Andris Skele.
	   Skele has said Latvia relies too much on transit trade to and
from Russia, and said policies should also focus on producing goods
in Latvia for export.
	   Other parties scoring around 15 percent in opinion surveys
include the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom, the centrist Latvias
Way and the opposition leftists, the Social Democrats.
	   The centrist News Party, led by flamboyant pop music composer
Raimonds Pauls, is also expected to score above the five percent
threshold required to win parliamentary seats.

Israel seals off Palestinian areas indefinitely

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Friday sealed off its borders with
the West Bank and Gaza Strip indefinitely amid warnings that the
Islamic militant group Hamas plans to carry out bombing attacks.
	   The closure takes effect at 2 p.m.. (noon gmt) Friday, the army
said. The restrictions bar the more than 2.5 million Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza from entering Israel.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai decided to impose the
closure after consulting with top army generals Friday. Mordechai
reportedly told the Israeli Cabinet on Thursday that Hamas planned
an ``unprecedented, horrific'' attack in Israel.

Three killed in Tajik border clash

	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Three people were killed Friday in a
battle with Russian border troops when a group of drug smugglers
tried to cross into Tajikistan from Afghanistan, officials said.
	   Alexander Kondratiyev, a spokesman for the Russian border
forces, said a group of 10 armed men tried to cross Tajikistan's
southern border before dawn, but they were spotted by Russian
troops based in the area. The Russian forces did not suffer any
casualties in the clash, he said.
	   Russian troops found a package of heroin and a machine gun after
the battle, he said.
	   Russia maintains some 20,000 border guards along Tajikistan's
border with Afghanistan, mainly to block Tajik forces opposed to
the pro-Moscow government in Dushanbe. There are frequent clashes
with the Tajik opposition forces and heroin smugglers based in
Afghanistan.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Many Asian markets drifted lower Friday as cautious
investors withdrew funds following a second day of losses exceeding
200 points in Wall Street's key stock index. Sinking stock prices
in New York have kindled doubts that Asian manufacturers can rely
on strong U.S. sales to keep their factories running when home
markets cannot. Singapore's main Index fell 16.03 points, or 1.8
percent, to 899.99. But some Asian markets shook off early
declines. In Tokyo, Japan's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average dipped
below 13,000 for the first time since January 1986 before reversing
course and closing up 26.57 points, or 0.20 percent, at 13,223.69.
South Korea's Composite Stock Price Index opened lower, but soon
recovered and closed at 308.25, up 2.61 points. The dollar dropped
1.50 yen in Tokyo, buying 134.78 yen in late afternoon trading. In
Europe, meanwhile, London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was down 140.9 at 4,767.3 in midmorning trading.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Government officials on Friday denied any
intention to ban Russians from buying foreign currency and said
they would decide how to deal with the economic crisis after
consulting with international lenders. Responding to media reports
of a government economic plan that would prohibit Russians from
buying U.S. dollars and other foreign currency, a Kremlin spokesman
said that President Boris Yeltsin is strongly opposed to such a
move. ``That would bring back the Iron Curtain,'' presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said. Central Bank chairman Viktor
Gerashchenko on Friday also dismissed a proposal to ban the
circulation of foreign currency as a ``mad idea.'' He and Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadornov were heading to Washington later Friday
for talks with the International Monetary Fund. Zadornov met in the
morning with leaders of the lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, to discuss how the government planned to meet its debts to
state-funded institutions. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Debt-laden Philippine Airlines said
Friday it will reopen next week after its workers voted by a wide
margin to accept a management-proposed recovery plan. About 61
percent of votes cast by members of PAL's largest union agreed to
accept a 10-year suspension of their collective bargaining
agreement in exchange for 20 percent of the company's stock and
seats on its board. PAL said it can resume flights to 14 domestic
destinations next Wednesday and to nine international destinations
within several weeks. It was the second time that the 6,700 members
of PAL's largest union had voted on the rescue plan. Last week,
they rejected the proposal, forcing the airline to shut down and
leaving much of the country without air service. The union had been
sharply split over the proposal, with militant members saying a
suspension of the bargaining agreement would violate workers'
rights. Union president Alex Barrientos, a supporter of the plan,
received death threats. He said militants seized control of the
union office Friday in a scuffle. (PHILIPPINES-PAL)
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ On the eve of a close election,
Prime Minister John Howard unveiled a 100 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 58 million) relief fund Friday to help those
worst hit by a natural gas shortage caused by a refinery explosion.
``Its conjunction with the federal election campaign is a matter of
sheer coincidence,'' Howard said. Howard said the fund would be
used to pay workers laid off as a result of the gas shutdown, help
the elderly and sick and offset the cost to business of converting
to non-gas energy in Victoria state. A fire at Esso's Longford gas
refinery Sept. 25 killed two men and injured eight. The plant
supplied more than 80 percent of the natural gas for Australia's
second-most populous state, and some 1.4 million households and
100,000 businesses may be without it for at least two weeks.
Industry will get priority over households once Victoria's gas
supply resumes flowing to enable people to get back to work, state
Premier Jeff Kennett said Thursday. (AUSTRALIA-GAS SHORTAGE)
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilians expect tougher times
will hit soon _ though even austerity measures don't appear to be
turning many against their president ahead of Sunday's election.
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, well out front of his 11
rivals in the presidential race, said this week that an austerity
package to ease Brazil's economic crisis isn't coming _ at least
not before Tuesday. But while Cardoso campaigned, his economic team
met in Washington with the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank, negotiating an emergency loan package reportedly worth
dlrs 30 billion or more. Despite leading a government with a
ballooning budget deficit and battered credibility, voters seem to
consider the 67-year-old sociologist who took office in 1995 the
best prepared to overcome 50 percent annual interest rates and
unemployment that is at its highest in a decade. (BRAZIL-ELECTIONS)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off threatened NATO
attacks, Yugoslavia's Serb leadership on Friday invited the U.N.
secretary general to visit, saying that would help him understand
``the real situation in Kosovo.'' The invitation, carried by the
state-run Tanjug news agency came only days before
Secretary-General Kofi Annan is scheduled to report on compliance
with a U.N. Security Council resolution, essentially demanding an
end to the Kosovo offensive by Serbian police and the Yugoslav
army. And it threatens unspecified further action if the demand is
ignored _ a condition seen by some NATO countries as opening the
door to military intervention. But ethnic Albanian guerrillas say
they won't abandon their battle for independence in the majority
ethnic Albanian province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
Attacks by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army against police and
soldiers led Milosevic to launch the crackdown Feb. 28.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A U.N. court on Friday ordered a former
Rwandan mayor to serve three life sentences for genocide and crimes
against humanity, plus 80 years for other violations including
rape. In the first judgment by an international court on genocide,
Jean-Paul Akayesu was convicted Sept. 2 of nine counts of genocide,
crimes against humanity and rape. Akayesu had made an impassioned
plea Monday for forgiveness from the Rwandan people for the
genocide of more than 500,000 people, mostly minority Tutsis, in
1994. However, Judge Laity Kama said Friday Akayesu ``chose to
participate in the genocide,'' and should therefore spend the rest
of his life in prison, according to the Swiss-based Hirondelle news
agency. Akayesu, who was born in 1953, was mayor of the central
village of Taba where 2,000 Tutsis who sought his protection were
killed. He has maintained his innocence, claiming he was unable to
stop the slaughter. An extremist Hutu government sponsored the
90-day slaughter, which ended when Tutsi-led rebels took power in
July 1994. (RWANDA-GENOCIDE TRIBUNAL)
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A commercial airliner that disappeared
into the Indian Ocean with 55 people on board this week may have
been shot down by Tamil rebels believing it was a military plane, a
naval officer said Friday. The plane could have strayed too close
to a rebel coastal base off the northern Jaffna Peninsula, said
Rear Admiral H.R. Amaraweera, the navy's director of operations.
The Lionair Antonov AN-24 looks like the air force Antonov AN-32
transport plane and the rebels may have hit it with missiles, said
Amaraweera. On Thursday, a naval gunboat spotted three bodies and
some wreckage floating near Iranaitivu, a tiny uninhabited island
off the country's northern coast 260 kilometers (160 miles) north
of Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital. The guerrillas have made no
comment on the missing plane. The rebels are fighting for a
separate homeland for minority Tamils in the country's north and
east, claiming that they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese. More than 55,000 people have been killed since the
fighting began in 1983. (SRI LANKA-PLANE CRASH)
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher on
Wednesday led a team of medical specialists to Africa to help
victims of the terrorist attacks on U.S. Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania. The U.S. team includes plastic surgeons with experience
in physical reconstruction, and a psychiatrist who worked in
Oklahoma City, where 168 people were killed in a 1995 bombing. The
team planned to leave Nairobi on Thursday for Dar es Salaam.
Besides meeting the immediate physical and emotional needs of
bombing victims, the United States will consider helping set up a
disaster response center in Kenya, Satcher said. U.S. President
Bill Clinton has requested dlrs 50 million in emergency assistance
funding from Congress for Tanzania and Kenya, where bombings Aug. 7
killed 259 people and injured more than 5,500. (KENYA-EMBASSY
BOMBINGS)
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ With the outcome of this weekend's
national election still too close to call, Prime Minister John
Howard on Friday urged voters to hand him a solid majority in
Parliament _ or throw him out of office. On the eve of the Saturday
vote, Howard's coalition and the main opposition Labor Party are
neck and neck in opinion polls, with government members warning
that Labor may end up with a slim lead. Labor's campaign has been
helped by the unpopularity of Howard's plan to introduce a 10
percent tax increase on all goods and services. Howard says tax
reform is crucial to Australia's economic future and has staked the
government's reelection hopes on the package. Despite being
sweetened with promises of big income tax cuts, polls show the new
tax is unpopular with voters. (AUSTRALIA-ELECTION)

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off threatened NATO
attacks, Yugoslavia's Serb leadership on Friday invited the U.N.
secretary general to visit, saying that would help him understand
``the real situation in Kosovo.'' But British leaders warned that
time to prevent such attacks was running short.
	   The invitation, carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency,
came only days before Secretary General Kofi Annan is scheduled to
submit a report on compliance with a U.N. Security Council
resolution, essentially demanding an end to the Kosovo offensive by
Serbian police and the Yugoslav army. And it threatens unspecified
further action if the demand is ignored _ a condition seen by some
NATO countries as opening the door to military intervention.
	   In Pristina, capital of Kosovo province, ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova urged NATO military strikes on the heels of a series
of reported massacres of Albanian villagers.
	   ``The most critical issue is to stop the war machine of Belgrade
and to protect the people of Kosovo,'' Rugova told reporters.
``Otherwise we will be seeing other massacres as we've already seen
in the past few weeks.''
	   On Thursday, Britain and the United States failed to convince
the Russians and Chinese to specifically blame the Serbs for the
killings at a new U.N. Security Council meeting. The council
instead strongly condemned the massacres and called on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to punish those responsible.
	   Britain, among the most vocal supporters of NATO action as a
last resort, delivered strong warnings on Friday.
	   ``This is a humanitarian disaster,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair
told Channel 4 TV News in London. ``I believe it will only be
stopped if Milosevic gets the clearest possible message ... namely,
if you carry on doing this, you will face a military penalty.''
	   Defense Secretary George Robertson warned the Yugoslav
leadership that the ``clock is ticking.''
	   ``Stop the violence, the cold-blooded murders of innocent
civilians, return your sinister troops to barracks, let the people
return to their homes in safety _ and start negotiating a political
settlement,'' he told a Labor Party conference in Blackpool. ``If
you don't ... then NATO, with Britain playing its full part, will
act decisively in the only way that you, Milosevic, seem to
respect.''
	   In Washington, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said
his government was willing to have international experts take part
in an investigation into the massacres to ``establish and prove the
facts.'' The Foreign Ministry in the capital Belgrade said
invitations went out to forensic experts from Finland. Serb police
have denied responsibility for murdering civilians.
	   The Serbs also announced the withdrawal of combat forces from
battlefields in Kosovo. But ethnic Albanian sources claimed
fighting continued Thursday along the border with Albania, where
separatist guerrillas take sanctuary, and Rugova challenged the
claims of pullbacks, saying the government had forces had ``only
changed their tactical position.''
	   He cited a report by the Albanian Human Rights Council which
says more than 1,400 people have been killed since the government
crackdown on Kosovo's guerillas began in late February. The United
Nations estimates hundreds killed and more than 270,000 homeless,
including more than 50,000 without shelter _ a source of concern
ahead of winter.
	   In Washington, Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior
Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the United
States and its NATO allies should prepare to launch an air
campaign.
	   ``With the onset of winter only weeks away, a humanitarian
catastrophe looms,'' Biden said in a speech to a foreign-policy
group.
	   Robert Gelbard, the U.S. envoy to the Balkans, said the
massacres have left the Belgrade government with ``no credibility
at all.''
	   ``We have seen atrocities piled on atrocities,'' Gelbard told
the British Broadcasting Corporation Thursday. ``Our people in
Kosovo ... have verified that these atrocities have occurred.''
	   In the latest allegation, Human Rights Watch said a
self-described survivor of one massacre supplied chilling new
details of alleged atrocities.
	   Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch said a wounded Albanian
reported that he and 13 other men were beaten and shot by Serb
police Saturday. He was the only survivor.
	   Bouckaert said the survivor's story was corroborated by other
witnesses from Golubovac, a village five kilometers (three miles)
from Donje Obrinje, site of another massacre.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A crippling seven-year rift in the
Bulgarian Orthodox church has ended, a churchman announced Friday,
at the conclusion of a secret conclave called to address the
problem.
	   The two-day meeting was chaired by Ecumenical Patriarch
Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of nearly 300 millions of
Orthodox Christians, in Sofia's Alexander Nevski cathedral.
	   The uncommon forum dealt with the feud between supporters of
Patriarch Maxim, who served as church leader under communist rule,
and Pymen, whose followers seceded in 1991 and proclaimed him
patriarch in 1996. Maxim promptly declared him excommunicated.
	   ``The rift was healed, it is over,'' said Metropolitan Meleti,
speaking on behalf of Bartholomew I.
	   An official statement is expected to be published later on
Friday.
	   After an hours-long debate late Thursday night, the clergymen
led by Pymen, who had seceded from the canonic Synod of Patriarch
Maxim, declared that they are penitent.
	   ``Those that have seceded from the Bulgarian Orthodox Church
have repented and are returning to its bosom,'' Maxim said
announcing the end of the rift.
	   Still, new conflict could emerge over whether Maxim agreed to
step down as part of the compromise. Pymen's spokesman, Anatoli
Balachev, said he hoped ``Maxim comprehended the hint given to him
by Bartholomew that the best thing he can do is step down,''
allowing for the appointment of a temporary substitute until
elections for a permanent replacement. But Maxim made no mention of
plans to step aside.
	   The seven-year old schism has badly damaged the image of the
Orthodox church in a country already badly polarized by the legacy
of communism. Government efforts to mediate were fruitless, and the
conflict led to several violent clashes between the two factions.

Pope back in Croatia to beatify controversial martyr
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EUGENE BRCIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARIJA BISTRICA, Croatia (AP) _ Four years to the day of his
last visit, Pope John Paul II is scheduled to arrive in Croatia to
beatify a controversial World War II cardinal and touch off a
search for lost moral values.
	   The pontiff is expected to land in the capital, Zagreb, at 17:30
p.m. (1530 GMT) Friday for a three-day tour.
	   During his papacy, John Paul has beatified 804 people. Cardinal
Alojzije Stepinac, Zagreb's archbishop during World War II, is not
one that will go unnoticed.
	   Stepinac welcomed the advent of dictator Ante Pavelic's
Nazi-puppet state in 1941 as an incarnation of centuries-old Croat
longings for an independent state.
	   By 1942, Stepinac had become a harsh critic. He denounced the
regime's genocidal policies, which killed tens of thousands of
Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croats.
	   Stepinac's personal notes and recent studies suggest he spoke
out against the atrocities and worked to save lives, but many Serbs
and Jews consider him a war criminal.
	   His critics say he carried out orders to convert Orthodox Serbs
and Jews to Catholicism and lifted his voice when it was too late.
	   Supporters see Stepinac as a hero for resisting attempts by the
former Communist government to suppress religion.
	   After the war, Stepinac was tried by Yugoslavia's Communist
authorities and sentenced to 16 years in prison for Nazi
collaboration. He died under house arrest in 1962, allegedly with
traces of poison in his blood.
	   In Marija Bistrica, where the pontiff is to carry out Saturday's
beatification ceremony, excitement was swelling.
	   Hundreds of workers have toiled for weeks at this popular Marian
shrine to prepare for up to 400,000 visitors.
	   ``This is the biggest day in the history of our small town,''
chirped 48 year-old Ivanka Ivak, a department store cashier. ``Of
course we're in good spirits.''
	   The mood was also festive in the coastal city of Split, adorned
in the Vatican's traditional yellow and white. The Pope is to
celebrate Mass outdoors Sunday, visit St. Dujam Cathedral and spend
time with youth.
	   Schools and stores will close early Friday, and a giant screen
will be set up in Zagreb's main square, providing complete coverage
of the pope's tour.
	   The pope is certain to send a sober message to his fellow Slavs.
Zagreb's archbishop, Josip Bozanic, indicated that the pontiff will
address the ``loss of moral values'' in post-war society, growing
materialism and an increasing spiritual void as the fledgling
nation moves towards full democracy.

EU clears dlrs 1.15 million in aid for China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Friday approved
1.05 million European currency units (dlrs 1.15 million) in aid for
victims of the current flood disaster in China.
	   The EU executive Commission said the funds will help carry out
emergency measures, particularly the distribution of food aid and
water purification to victims of the floods.
	   ``About 225 million people - about one-fifth of China's whole
population - are affected'' by the floods, the Commission said.
	   The statement said there have been over 3,000 deaths, and almost
14 million people have been displaced.
	   The funds will be channeled through the International Federation
of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent.
	   Last week, the United Nations launched an appeal for a total
dlrs 139 million in disaster relief for flood victims.
	   A U.N disaster assessment team returning from flood-hit areas in
the south and northeast of China stressed the urgency of providing
shelter to victims, with the onset of winter in northern China five
to six weeks away.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, the Commission has allocated a
total of 2.73 million ecu (dlrs 3 million) in humanitarian aid for
victims of natural disasters in China, the Commission statement
said.

Russia develops new jet-powered flamethrower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has developed a jet-powered flamethrower
that has the power of a cannon and can be used in the most
difficult terrain, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Friday.
	   The new device is a major advance because it marries the
flamethrower with a jet, making it more accurate and giving it much
greater range, the report said.
	   The flamethrower is an infantry weapon dating back to World War
I, which fires blasts of burning gasoline or other chemicals at
targets. It is no longer widely used because had limited range and
was cumbersome.
	   The new Russian version, called the Bumble Bee, has an impact
comparable to a 152 mm artillery shell and a range of up to 1,000
meters (yards), the report said. It can be employed in rugged
countryside or city fighting where artillery would be difficult to
employ, it said.
	   The report said the new weapon would be available for export.

Israel seals off West Bank, Gaza indefinitely
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Friday sealed its borders with the
West Bank and Gaza Strip indefinitely following warnings by the
defense minister that the Islamic militant group Hamas plotted an
``unprecedented, horrific'' attack in Israel.
	   The closure came as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reported
some progress in talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal. A Hamas
bombing would disrupt the U.S.-brokered negotiations which are to
climax with a four-day Mideast summit in Washington in mid-October.
	   However, the Palestinians denounced the closure as collective
punishment, saying it would hurt the Palestinian economy and keep
tens of thousands of workers from their jobs.
	   Israeli and Palestinian security forces have thwarted recent
attempts by Hamas to carry out attacks in Israel in retaliation for
the killing of two of the group's fugitives by Israeli soldiers.
	   A Palestinian security official said Friday that two Hamas
activists were caught a week ago with 60 kilos (130 pounds) of
explosives. The two were en route to the Nahal Oz crossing between
the Gaza Strip and Israel, the official said.
	   Earlier this week, a Hamas activist was killed when a car rigged
with explosives blew up in a West Bank village. In the West Bank
town of Hebron, Palestinian police seized nearly a ton of
explosives in a raid of a Hamas bomb factory.
	   Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in
Israel since 1994 and has threatened new attacks.
	   In troubled Hebron, meanwhile, dozens of Palestinians hurled
stones and empty bottles at Israeli soldiers who fired
rubber-coated steel pellets. Seven Palestinians were injured,
including one who was in serious condition.
	   Clashes erupted before and after Muslim noon prayers.
	   The Israeli-controlled downtown area of Hebron has been under
curfew since Wednesday when two grenades were thrown at Israeli
security forces, wounding 22 people. Hebron is home to 450 Jewish
settlers and 130,000 Palestinians.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai decided after
consultations with top army generals Friday to seal the West Bank
and Gaza indefinitely. The Israeli newspaper Maariv quoted
Mordechai as telling the Israeli Cabinet on Thursday that ``Hamas
wants to carry out a horrific, unprecedented attack in Israel.''
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the Palestinian
Authority has taken sporadic steps to control Hamas, but ``it's far
short of what we would like.''
	   Fogel warned that an attack would hurt the peace process. In the
past, Israel has suspended talks with the Palestinians after
large-scale attacks by Palestinian extremists.
	   However, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the closure
constituted collective punishment and that Israel must stop taking
unilateral steps. ``Instead of taking us as partners, they (the
Israelis) subject us to closures,'' he said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to arrive in the
Middle East on Tuesday for two days of talks to prepare for an
summit meeting in Washington.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton invited Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington to try to complete a
long-delayed agreement over a further Israeli pullback in the West
Bank. Erekat said the summit will take place Oct. 15-19.
	   Netanyahu faces conflicting pressures inside his own coalition
government. A Cabinet minister from the pro-settler National
Religious Party declared that Netanyahu should refuse to go to
Washington. Science Minister Silvan Shalom, from Netanyahu's Likud
Party rejected that, but only for tactical reasons. He told Israel
radio that ``Israel would get all the blame'' for a breakdown of
the peace talks and would face isolation in the world.

Chief observer says Cambodian election reflected will of the
</HEADLINE>
people &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The chief European Union observer
certified Friday that Cambodia's elections had reflected the will
of the people, but said more could have been done to ease tensions
after the vote.
	   EU Chief Observer Sven Linder said in his final statement on the
July 26 election that he and his 215 foreign monitors witnessed no
major irregularities on polling day or during the following day's
counting of the ballots.
	   Linder said, however, that the National Election Committee and
Cambodia's highest court could have done more to address complaints
by the opposition alleging fraud and intimidation. Both bodies were
controlled by loyalists of the ruling Cambodian People's Party.
	   After opposition appeals to the election bodies were rejected,
thousands of opposition supporters took to the streets in
demonstrations calling for Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ouster.
	   Last month, police violently suppressed the opposition-led
demonstrations.
	   Hun Sen's party won a narrow majority in the election, claiming
64 of 122 seats in parliament, but not the two-thirds needed to
form a government alone. The two-party opposition won 58 seats.
	   Sven Linder said tensions could have been eased if the
opposition's demands for recounts and other complaints were better
handled by the NEC, but he doubted that serious fraud occurred.
	   ``The European Union Observation Unit has found no indication of
flaws and frauds of a magnitude that could have distorted the will
of the Cambodian voters,'' Linder said.
	   The EU was the largest single foreign contributor to the
elections, donating dlrs 11 million to the process.
	   Mediation efforts by King Norodom Sihanouk helped bring the
three parties to the bargaining table last month. The National
Assembly officially convened last week, but no progress has been
made in forming the next government.
	   A senior minister in Hun Sen's government on Friday blamed the
opposition for the continuing delays and said the outgoing
government would continue working until a new one is formed.
	   ``We have tried very hard to see the National Assembly meet so
we can form the new government, but the problem is the opposition
parties keep looking for ways to prevent this process from moving
forward,'' Sok An said after a Cabinet meeting.
	   The opposition has maintained that its allegations of fraud must
be thoroughly investigated before discussions on the new government
begin.

Russian health system facing critical shortage of medicines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's public health system won't be able to
provide adequate treatment for many patients because it is
dependent on imported medicines that have become too expensive, a
top official said Friday.
	   Health Minister Vladimir Starodubov said the poorly-funded
system was dependent on imported medicines and ingredients to
manufacture drugs and the cost was prohibitive following the sharp
fall of the ruble.
	   Starodubov said in an interview with the ITAR-Tass news agency
that the problem could not be solved by issuing edicts limiting the
price of medicines because the supply would simply dry up. He said
the health system must have more money or it would not be able to
cope.
	   The Russian economy plunged into crisis in August after the
government defaulted on loans, causing the value of the Russian
currency to drop against the U.S. dollar by some 250 percent. The
government has been struggling for years to fund the health system
and other services because of a drastic lack of public funds.

EU clears dlrs 1.15 million in aid for China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union approved 1.05
million European currency units (dlrs 1.15 million) Friday in aid
for victims of the flooding in China.
	   The EU executive Commission said the funds will help carry out
emergency measures, particularly the distribution of food aid and
water purification to victims of the floods.
	   ``About 225 million people _ about one-fifth of China's whole
population _ are affected'' by the floods, the Commission said.
	   The floods have killed more than 3,000 people, and affected
about 233 million.
	   The funds will be channeled through the International Federation
of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent.
	   Last week, the United Nations launched an appeal for a total
dlrs 139 million in disaster relief for flood victims.
	   A U.N. disaster assessment team returning from flood-hit areas
in the south and northeast of China stressed the urgency of
providing shelter to victims, with the onset of winter in northern
China five to six weeks away.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, the Commission has allocated a
total of 2.73 million ecu (dlrs 3 million) in humanitarian aid for
victims of natural disasters in China, the Commission statement
said.

Karpov refuses to take part in next World Chess Championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ World chess champion Anatoly Karpov threatened
Friday to legally challenge a rule change that would oblige him to
defend his title for the second time this year.
	   The World Chess Federation recently decided to hold its
championships annually instead of every other year, as it did
previously. It intends to hold the next World Chess Championship in
Las Vegas in November _ less than a year after Karpov defended his
title.
	   Karpov, a Russian, won the World Chess Federation title for the
sixth time in a January match with India's Viswanathan Anand.
	   Karpov also objected to new rules of the federation, known by
its French acronym as FIDE, which would require the defending
champion to defend his title in competition with numerous players,
instead of against a single challenger who had won previous
tournaments.
	   ``There's no way that I would participate under such
conditions,'' Karpov said, adding that the changes would make the
world championship a random and chaotic event.
	   ``We can just as well play roulette in Las Vegas to determine a
champion,'' he told a news conference.
	   Karpov said he would go to Russia's southern region of Kalmykia
on Saturday to try to persuade the federation's leaders to change
their mind. FIDE's president is Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, a chess buff
who is president of Kalmykia.
	   Karpov added, however, that he had little hope of succeeding and
was preparing a lawsuit against FIDE in Lausanne, Switzerland, the
organization's headquarters.
	   Karpov's refusal to play in FIDE's championship would add
confusion to the chess world.
	   ``We already have three people considering themselves World
Champions _ (Russian Garry) Kasparov, Karpov and (American Bobby)
Fisher, and now we are going to have a fourth one,'' he said.
	   Kasparov is reigning world champion of the rival Professional
Chess Association.
	   Karpov accused Ilyumzhinov of ignoring his repeated pledges to
consult with him on the change in rules.
	   ``They claim they make the change in the interests of other
players, but chess has always been a kingdom, not a democracy,''
Karpov said.
	   An annual chess Olympiad is currently underway in Kalmykia. Some
2,000 players and guests from 157 countries are attending the
tournament, which started last month and is to end Oct. 13.

Albanians agree on new cabinet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's new prime minister announced
agreement on a new government Friday, and said the 18 cabinet
members would be sworn in later in the day.
	   Attempts by Socialist Prime Minister Pandeli Majko to reach
agreement with his coalition partners Wednesday and Thursday failed
after a minority party demanded the deputy prime ministership.
	   The Socialists, who held the position in the previous
government, refused to give up the post.
	   The Social Democrats withdrew their demands Friday, and accepted
the posts of minister of transportation and minister of public
works.
	   The new government will focus on restoring public order and
decreasing tensions in this impoverished Balkan nation after months
of unrest, Majko said.
	   Majko came to power after his predecessor, Fatos Nano, resigned
Monday after failing to win approval for Cabinet changes following
riots two weeks ago triggered by the assassination of a popular
opposition leader.
	   Former President Sali Berisha, who heads the opposition
Democratic Party, blamed Nano for the assassination and led a
series of protests that threatened to plunge the country into
chaos.
	   Majko said the government will work to open up dialogue with the
opposition.
	   Other priorities will include passing a new constitution and
keeping track of the situation in neighboring Kosovo, where the
ethnic Albanian majority is fighting for independence from Serbia.
	   Albania is still trying to recover from nationwide riots that
exploded in 1997 after pyramid investment schemes collapsed,
depriving many Albanians of their life savings.
	   Berisha, who was president at the time, resigned after
internationally sponsored elections brought Nano and his Socialists
to power.

France easeing repayment of Morocco's debt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Jospin announcing debt forgiveness

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Friday said that
France will ease repayment of Morocco's foreign debt, which has
become a huge burden for the North African kingdom.
	   Speaking at a joint news conference with Moroccan Prime Minister
Abderrahmane Youssoufi, Jospin said Paris will set aside 4.2
billion francs (dlrs 760 million) to ease Morocco's debt to France.
	   That debt is currently about 19 billion French francs (dlrs 3.3
billion), or about 17.5 percent of the country's total foreign
debt.
	   ``France is determined to remain Morocco's primary economic
partner, its primary investor and its primary financial
supporter,'' Jospin said before his talks with Youssoufi.
	   The Moroccan leader said that the debt represented his country's
``most ``our most serious difficulty in continuing our economic,
financial, social and human development.''
	   Morocco's foreign debt constitutes about 58 percent of the
country's gross domestic product.
	   Throughout his visit to France which began Wednesday, Youssoufi
has been pressing for an easing of the debt and Jospin's remarks
came as no surprise.
	   ``France has confidence in the Moroccan economy, as it has
confidence in happy outcome of the democratic process that Mr.
Yousouffi's government is carrying out,'' Jospin said.
	   Youssouffi also said that easing Morocco's debt would help
stimulate foreign investment as well as permit the Moroccan
government to address social priorities.
	   The Moroccan prime minister called for some of the country's
debt to be converted to investment credits and said such a
conversion would be a big boost for the local economy. He also said
easing the debt would help free funds for Moroccan government to
address social priorities.
	   A Socialist, Youssoufi was named prime minister in March by King
Hassan II, breaking three months of political deadlock after
legislative elections that left the country without governing
coalition.

Taiwan scraps military display to build atmosphere for China talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS description of weapons on display, graf 6; CORRECTS
semiofficial sted private, graf 11 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Seeking to sweeten the atmosphere for
talks, Taiwan on Friday canceled a large military display that
could have disturbed Beijing just before a top envoy's visit to
China.
	   The staging of the event was ``not appropriate at this time,''
Armed Forces Commander in Chief Tang Fei told reporters after a
rehearsal for the live-fire display, designed to show off new
weapons.
	   By canceling the display, originally scheduled Oct. 12 in
southern Pingtung County, Taiwan hopes to set the stage for
``pleasant relations between the sides'' and avoid ``unnecessary
misunderstanding and difficulties,'' Tang said.
	   He said Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui participated in the
decision to cancel the display.
	   The Defense Ministry spokesman's office said there were no
immediate plans to reschedule. A second rehearsal scheduled for
Oct. 7 was also canceled.
	   But Tang's announcement came only after a full-scale, televised
rehearsal in which tanks, planes and attack helicopters staged a
mock assault, and navy frigates fired missiles off the Pingtung
coast.
	   Taiwan hopes informal talks by Koo Chen-fu, an elderly adviser
who is Lee's top negotiator with China, in Shanghai and Beijing
will pave the way for a formal restoration of dialogue.
	   Koo's trip, beginning Oct. 14, marks the best hope for a
resumption since Beijing broke off talks in 1995 in anger over
Taiwan's drive for greater international recognition.
	   Taiwan feared that showing off advanced new weapons _ U.S. F-16
and French Mirage 20005 fighters and French Lafayette missile
cruisers _ would have been too blatant a reminder of the island's
determination to resist Beijing's coercion.
	   Many legislators applauded the decision to cancel, but some in
the opposition called it unnecessary and said it may set a bad
precedent.
	   ``I think this is a goodwill gesture and Beijing can be expected
to pick up on it,'' said Andrew Yang, secretary-general of the
semiofficial Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies.
	   The cancellation could be counted as the second concession to
China in advance of Koo's visit. Vice President Lien Chan has also
shelved plans for impromptu trips abroad that Beijing finds
infuriating.
	   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government driven from the
mainland in 1949 by Communist forces. China claims the island as a
renegade province, and its threat to use force if necessary to
bring it back prompts Taiwan to allocate huge defense budgets.
	   The timing of military exercises by either side has been the
subject of intense scrutiny since China staged threatening war
games during Taiwan's presidential elections in 1996.
	   Drills staged by Taiwan during Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese
rule on July 1, 1997, were widely considered a message to the world
that Taiwan would determine its own fate.

Israel seals off West Bank, Gaza indefinitely
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Friday sealed its borders with the
West Bank and Gaza Strip indefinitely following warnings by the
defense minister that the Islamic militant group Hamas plotted an
``unprecedented, horrific'' attack in Israel.
	   The closure came as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reported
some progress in talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal. A Hamas
bombing would disrupt the U.S.-brokered negotiations which are to
climax with a four-day Mideast summit in Washington in mid-October.
	   However, the Palestinians denounced the closure as collective
punishment, saying it would hurt the Palestinian economy and keep
tens of thousands of workers from their jobs.
	   Israeli and Palestinian security forces have thwarted recent
attempts by Hamas to carry out attacks in Israel in retaliation for
the killing of two of the group's fugitives by Israeli soldiers.
	   A Palestinian security official said Friday that two Hamas
activists were caught a week ago with 60 kilos (130 pounds) of
explosives. The two were en route to the Nahal Oz crossing between
the Gaza Strip and Israel, the official said.
	   Earlier this week, a Hamas activist was killed when a car rigged
with explosives blew up in a West Bank village. In the West Bank
town of Hebron, Palestinian police seized nearly a ton of
explosives in a raid of a Hamas bomb factory.
	   Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in
Israel since 1994 and has threatened new attacks.
	   In troubled Hebron, meanwhile, dozens of Palestinians hurled
stones and empty bottles at Israeli soldiers who fired
rubber-coated steel pellets. Seven Palestinians were injured,
including one who was in serious condition.
	   Clashes erupted before and after Muslim noon prayers.
	   The Israeli-controlled downtown area of Hebron has been under
curfew since Wednesday when two grenades were thrown at Israeli
security forces, wounding 22 people. Hebron is home to 450 Jewish
settlers and 130,000 Palestinians.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai decided after
consultations with top army generals Friday to seal the West Bank
and Gaza indefinitely. The Israeli newspaper Maariv quoted
Mordechai as telling the Cabinet on Thursday that ``Hamas wants to
carry out a horrific, unprecedented attack in Israel.''
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the Palestinian
Authority has taken sporadic steps to control Hamas, but ``it's far
short of what we would like.''
	   Fogel warned that an attack would hurt the peace process. In the
past, Israel has suspended talks with the Palestinians after
large-scale attacks by Palestinian militants.
	   However, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the closure
constituted collective punishment and that Israel must stop taking
unilateral steps. ``Instead of taking us as partners, they (the
Israelis) subject us to closures,'' he said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to arrive Tuesday
in the Middle East for two days of talks to prepare for an summit
meeting in Washington.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton invited Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington to try to complete a
long-delayed agreement over a further Israeli pullback in the West
Bank. Erekat said the summit will take place Oct. 15-19.
	   Netanyahu faces conflicting pressures inside his own coalition
government. A Cabinet minister from the pro-settler National
Religious Party declared that Netanyahu should refuse to go to
Washington. Science Minister Silvan Shalom, from Netanyahu's Likud
Party rejected that, but only for tactical reasons. He told Israel
radio that ``Israel would get all the blame'' for a breakdown of
the peace talks and would face isolation in the world.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Government officials on Friday denied any
intention to ban Russians from buying foreign currency and said
they would decide how to deal with the economic crisis after
consulting with international lenders.
	   Responding to media reports of a government economic plan that
would prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars and other foreign
currency, a Kremlin spokesman said that President Boris Yeltsin is
strongly opposed to such a move.
	   ``That would bring back the Iron Curtain,'' presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko on Friday also
dismissed a proposal to ban the circulation of foreign currency as
a ``mad idea.''
	   He and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov headed to Washington on
Friday afternoon for talks with the International Monetary Fund.
	   Zadornov met in the morning with leaders of the lower house of
parliament, the State Duma, to discuss how the government planned
to meet its debts to state-funded institutions.
	   Nikolai Kharitonov, head of the Agrarian Party faction, said the
government's crisis program ``is most likely to be composed after
we check our watches with the IMF, that is, when it becomes clear
what we can count on _ only on ourselves or on some outside
support,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Thursday that he might be
forced to take ``unpopular measures'' to salvage the Russian
economy if the IMF didn't come through with more money.
	   Russia has been trying to pressure the lending agency into
releasing the second, dlrs 4.3 billion installment of a loan that
was approved in July, a month before the country's economy crashed
and the government effectively defaulted on its foreign loans.
	   The IMF credit would allow Russia to come out of the crisis
``with minimum losses,'' Primakov said. Without the loan, he added,
``We will take measures _ measures that may be quite unpopular. We
will not throw our country to the winds.''
	   The business daily Kommersant said that the Cabinet has drafted
a budget for the fourth quarter of 1998 with a deficit nearing 100
billion rubles (around dlrs 6 billion), which is to be financed
almost entirely by the IMF loan.
	   IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to come
up with a sound economic program before the loan is given, and have
made it clear that currency controls and boosting the money supply
by printing rubles are not acceptable.
	   The government was reportedly considering an economic plan
loaded with just such measures. The blueprint was prepared by Yuri
Maslyukov, a Communist who is first deputy prime minister in charge
of economic strategy. Maslyukov served as the last chairman of the
Soviet central planning agency.
	   Primakov said that the plan, which was outlined Thursday in
Kommersant, is just one of six alternatives his Cabinet is
considering.
	   A government session on Thursday considered Maslyukov's plan but
refused to accept it after Zadornov's sharp criticism, Kommersant
said Friday.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off threatened NATO
attacks, Yugoslavia's Serb leadership on Friday invited the U.N.
secretary general to visit, saying that would help him understand
``the real situation in Kosovo.''
	   The invitation, carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency came
only days before Secretary General Kofi Annan is scheduled to
submit a report on compliance with a U.N. Security Council
resolution, essentially demanding an end to the Kosovo offensive by
Serbian police and the Yugoslav army. And it threatens unspecified
further action if the demand is ignored _ a condition seen by some
NATO countries as opening the door to military intervention.
	   In Pristina, capital of Kosovo province, ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova said Friday NATO military strikes in Kosovo would be
a humanitarian move that would save the Serbian province's majority
Albanian population. He spoke on the heels of a series of reported
massacres of Albanian villagers.
	   ``The most critical issue is to stop the war machine of Belgrade
and to protect the people of Kosovo,'' Rugova told reporters, when
asked about the effectiveness of any eventual air strikes. ``That's
an issue of humanity. Otherwise we will be seeing other massacres
as we've already seen in the past few weeks.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Stock prices fell sharply in Europe Friday,
following sharp drops on Wall Street the previous two days, but
Tokyo's key index finished higher after scraping a 12-year low.
	   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, the leading
barometer on the Stock Exchange in London, was down 150.2 points,
or 3 percent, at 4,758.0 at noon. Information technology, telecoms
and financial stocks led the decline, as concerns about financial
turmoil in the banking sector battered European markets.
	   Frankfurt's main index dropped more than 5 percent, while share
prices were down 5 percent in Zurich, 3.6 percent in Milan and more
than 3 percent in Paris.
	   ``We're entering a very grave global situation. A global
recession seems very likely,'' said Lionel Sens, a salesman at
Credit Lyonnais Securities in Paris. ``Things aren't going to
improve anytime soon.''
	   Singapore's Straits Times Index fell 16.03 points, or 1.8
percent, to 899.99.
	   ``I suppose it's not unexpected given what's happened on Wall
Street and the other markets,'' said Yang Sy Jian, chief economist
at Kay Hian Research in Singapore.
	   The Dow, which fell 237.90 points Wednesday, dropped another
210.09 points, or 2.7 percent, on Thursday, closing at 7,632.53.
	   The selling spree, sparked by worries about shrinking corporate
profits and fears of new financial crises, left the Dow 18.3
percent, or more than 1,700 points, below the all-time high of
9,337.97 reached July 17.
	   Sinking stock prices in New York have kindled doubts about
whether Asian manufacturers can rely on strong sales in the United
States.
	   In Tokyo, however, the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average closed up
26.57 points, or 0.2 percent, at 13,223.69 after dipping below
13,000 for the first time since January 1986.
	   South Korea's Composite Stock Price Index opened lower, but soon
recovered and closed at 308.25, up 2.61 points.
	   ``We had expected a significant fall today too, but it was not
so bad as we expected,'' said Lee Chu-bum, an analyst at Seoul's
Dongwon Securities Co.
	   In Australia, the All Ordinaries stock index fell 36.9 points,
or 1.4 percent, closing at 2,532.3. Bank shares led the market
lower after the drop in financial shares traded overnight in New
York, but this was partially offset by a rise in mining stocks on
higher gold prices, traders said.
	   Neighboring New Zealand's NZSE-40 capital index lost 26.30
points, closing at 1,668.24 _ its second straight day at a
five-year low.
	   Markets in Manila and Taipei were similarly hit hard today after
sharp declines in the previous day's trading. The 30-share
Philippine Stock Exchange Index retreated 31.70 points, or 2.6
percent, ending the week at 1,195.62.
	   In Taiwan, the Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange
sank 266.06 points, or 3.96 percent, to 6,346.00. Wall Street
worries added to concerns over reports that a local transportation
conglomerate was unable to meet its payment obligations, traders
said.
	   Also affected by worries about the global economy, Indonesia's
JSX Composite Index lost 10.639 points, or 3.9 percent, closing at
263.229.
	   Hong Kong and Shanghai financial markets were closed today to
celebrate China's National Day holiday.

Maccabi draws Austria's SV Ried after PSG upset
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Surprise conqueror of Paris Saint Germain
Thursday, Israel's Maccabi Haifa has been rewarded with an easier
game against Austria's SV Ried in the second round of the Cup
Winners Cup.
	   A deflected injury time winner by Alon Mizrahi gave Maccabi a
3-2 victory over the French powerhouse, a Cup Winners titlist only
two seasons ago, just as PSG appeared to be going through on the
basis of scoring more away goals.
	   Liverpool must play Valencia and Premier League leader Aston
Villa faces Celta Vigo in two England vs. Spain matchups created by
Friday's UEFA Cup draw.
	   Italian league leader Fiorentina meets Switzerland's
Grasshoppers while Roma has a tough game against managerless Leeds
United, Parma visits Poland's Wisla Krakow in the first leg when
Bologna hosts Slavia Prague.
	   With clubs segregated to avoid clubs from the same country
playing each other, many of the strong teams stayed apart.
	   But the draw means that the last 16 may be without two of the
three English clubs or two of the five Spanish teams.
	   Although Celta Vigo has drawn all four of its Spanish league
games so far including a 2-2 tie with mighty Barecelona, it seems
to be saving its best form for the UEFA Cup.
	   On Tuesday the Spanish team crushed Arges of Romania 7-0 with
three goals from veteran Bulgarian striker Luboslav Penev.
	   Valencia, whose last European triumph was in the Cup Winners Cup
in 1980, is confident of surprising four-time Champions Cup titlist
Liverpool.
	   ``It seems to us a very exciting tie,'' said club spokesman Jose
Lopez. ``We're going into it very happy. I would say it's 50-50,
but we're fairly confident.''
	   Stuttgart, one of three German survivors, faces Belgium's Club
Brugges having produced one of the greatest comeback in the
competition's history.
	   On Tuesday, Stuttgart scored a 3-0 victory at Feyenoord to wipe
out the Dutch club's 3-1 triumph in the first leg in Germany.
	   In the Cup Winners Cup, star-studded defending titlist Chelsea,
which scraped into the second round after a goalless tie with
modest Swedish club Helsingborg, goes to FC Copenhagen in the first
leg. The Danish club crushed Levski Sofia 4-1 Thursday to gain the
second round.
	   Chelsea managing director Colin Hutchinson said the first leg
mey be moved to Chelsea because the same field at the Parken
stadium will be used the previous day for the Brondby vs.
Manchester United Champions Cup game.
	   Poul-Erik Petersen, FC Copenhagen's sports director, admitted
his team had drawn the toughest opponent.
	   ``But there will be a lot of interest for the Danish people,
because Brian Laudrup will be playing for Chelsea,'' he said.
``There will be high interest to watch a great team like Chelsea.''
	   Lazio, another leading contender, only made it on the away goals
rule after gaining a 2-2 tie with Lausanne and now meets Partizan
Belgrade, conquerer of Ruud Gullit's Newcastle by the same rule.
	   Mallorca has been drawn to meet Belgium's Genk but will be
replaced Hearts if the Scottish club wins its protest that the
Spanish club's goalposts were the wrong size.
	   The two teams tied 1-1 Thursday so that Mallorca advanced 2-1.
But Hearts complained to UEFA that the goalposts at one end of the
Luis Sitjar Stadium were too close together.
	   Ramon Servallas, director of external relations for the Spanish
club, argued that whatever the dimensions of the goalposts, neither
team was favored over the other.
	   ``The protest makes no sense, but they have all the right in the
world to make it,'' he said.
	   ``It must be said that in the morning inspection of the pitch
the goal was inspected'' and UEFA officials found nothing unusual.

Japan's banking reform bills pass Parliament's lower house
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos TOK110-113 &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Parliament's lower house late Friday passed a
package of bills that would allow using taxpayer money to help
clean up Japanese banks' massive bad loan problem, widely viewed as
a crucial first step to economic recovery.
	   The bills are seen as necessary to end the credit crunch
devastating businesses, especially small and medium-size companies.
With unemployment at a record high, bankruptcies soaring and
consumer spending lagging, Japan has been unable to climb out of
its worst recession in 50 years.
	   The bills, approved after weeks of bickering between the ruling
party and the opposition, now go to the upper house, where they are
likely to pass next week and become law.
	   This would be a major victory for Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi,
who has come under fire both at home and abroad for not taking
quick enough action to fix the economy and the bad loan mess,
estimated to be as big as dlrs 1 trillion.
	   ``We must first solve the worries about the financial system,
which is the artery of our economy,'' said ruling party lawmaker
Kazumi Mochinaga.
	   While legislators were fighting over the bills last weekend,
Japan Leasing Corp. filed for bankruptcy _ Japan's biggest
bankruptcy since World War II. Its parent company was the ailing
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, whose bailout was the key sticking
point in the political wrangling.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has been anxious to save
Long-Term Credit Bank, one of the nation's biggest banks, as well
as other banks. But the opposition has opposed the plan, instead
pushing for a solution that would force bank managements to be more
accountable.
	   Under the new law, the government would set up an organization
similar to the U.S. Resolution Trust Corp. in the 1980s U.S.
savings and loan crisis. The agency would buy bad debt from banks
with a pool of public funds of about 10 trillion yen (dlrs 74
billion).
	   An earlier public fund proposed by the ruling party was turned
down because the opposition felt the Finance Ministry had too much
sway over its use.
	   The power of the Finance Ministry has been another point of
contention between the ruling party and the opposition. Many
Japanese blame the ministry for failing to keep the bad debt
problem in check.
	   In the latest agreement, the ruling party gave in to the
opposition demand to take away some of the ministry's policy-making
authority over the financial system by 2000.
	   With the popularity of Obuchi's administration plunging, the
ruling party was eager to have the bills passed as quickly as
possible. This gave the opposition far greater leverage than in the
past.
	   Some analysts said the legislation was too unclear on which
troubled banks will qualify for the money.
	   ``This legislation is basically the same as having no
legislation,'' Yasunari Ueno, chief economist at Fuji Securities,
told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   Although the fight over the bills has come to an end, carrying
out the cleanup is likely to be a drawn-out struggle.
	   For decades, the ruling party has closely taken instructions
from Finance Ministry officials. Lawmakers acknowledge they were
kept in the dark by the ministry about the magnitude of the bad
loan problem.
	   ``Things seem to be moving slowly to outsiders' eyes,'' Akitaka
Saiki, a spokesman for the prime minister, told reporters this week
when questioned about Tokyo's dragged out response to mounting
economic problems. ``But we are making utmost efforts with an
extreme sense of urgency.''

More than 50 illegal migrants detained at Ukraine's border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian border guards detained more than
50 illegal migrants in a single day, officials said Friday.
	   Most of the 41 migrants from Afghanistan were taken off a
passenger train headed to the western Ukrainian border city of
Uzhgorod from Moscow on Thursday, the Ukrainian border guard
command reported.
	   Ten more migrants, all from Sri Lanka, were detained at
Ukraine's western border near the town of Mukachevo. Local
residents from a nearby village helped border guards capture two
more illegal migrants, the command said.
	   In a related development, border guards from neighboring
Slovakia turned over to Ukraine 73 Southeast Asian migrants who had
illegally crossed the Ukrainian border this week.
	   The number of illegal migrants from poor Asian nations trying to
cross into Western Europe through the former Soviet Union,
especially Ukraine and Russia, has increased drastically in recent
years.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A disgruntled former employee hijacked a company
plane Friday and took 15 hostages, forcing the pilot to land at an
airport outside Marseille on Friday, officials said.
	   The plane, identified as a Fokker-20 belonging to Serge Dassault
Aviation on a flight from Paris, landed at Marseille-Marignane
Airport at 12:30 p.m. (1030 GMT), Marseille police said.
	   The hijacker, armed with a knife, first demanded to talk to his
lawyer, the police said on customary anonymity.

Singapore denies Malaysia's allegations of air space intrusions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore has denied Malaysian allegations that
Singapore military jets have intruded in Malaysian airspace,
television reported late Friday, quoting a Defense Ministry
spokesman.
	   Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar accused Singapore
Thursday of violating Malaysian air and sea space at least seven
times since Sept. 18, when Malaysia revoked the longstanding
agreement allowing all Singapore military aircraft to enter its
airspace while in transit or on search and rescue missions.
	   The abrupt decision came amid a bitter row between the two
Southeast Asian neighbors.
	   Syed Hamid also dismissed Singapore's accusation that Malaysian
officials impeded the rescue last week of a British navy crewman
after a helicopter crash in the South China Sea.
	   A spokesman for Singapore's Defense Ministry said Malaysia has
not officially complained about any airspace intrusion by
Singapore, Singapore TV's main news Channel 5 reported.

Congolese rebels take fight to the Internet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels have taken their two-month
capaign to oust President Laurent Kabila to the Internet.
	   ``We have to explain to the world audience who we are and what
we're fighting for,'' rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said on
Friday. ``Besides, the (Kabila) government has been using the
Internet to tell their side of the story.''
	   The 56-year-old history professor at the University of Dar es
Salaam in Tanzania said supporters of the Congolese Rally for
Democracy in the United States have created a web site for the
rebellion.
	   The site _ www.prairienet.org/panafrican/cdm _ has been set up
on the donor-supported Prairenet Community Network in eastern
Illinois.
	   The rebels are a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted
members of Kabila's army and political opponents who accuse Kabila
of power-grabbing, mismanagement, corruption and sowing dissent
among Congo's 400 tribes.
	   After an initial lightning advance in the far west of Africa's
third-largest nation, the rebels were stopped at the outskirts of
the capital, Kinshasa, by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia,
who are backing Kabila.
	   Since then, the rebels have been confined to a chunk of
territory in the extreme eastern part of the country where their
rebellion was declared Aug. 2.
	   Wamba said the rebels control 40 percent of Congo, an area of 15
million people.
	   So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels,
accusing them of being the puppets of neighboring Rwanda and
Uganda.
	   Posting the rebel mission statement on the Internet is just part
of the media campaign.
	   Last week, Wamba dispatched two of his top aides to the United
States and Europe to lobby for political support and raise public
awareness about the conflict in Congo.
	   ``World leaders, diplomats and are not familiar enough with our
cause. They still talk about Tutsis leading the rebellion. Well,
I'm not a Tutsi,'' Wamba said.
	   Jacques Depelchin, the movement's vice president and a former
lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley, met in
Washington earlier this week with the U.S. special envoy in the
Great Lakes region of Central Africa, Howard Wolpe and with
congressmen, Wamba said.

Yugoslavia offers new cooperation in effort to stave off NATO
</HEADLINE>
attack
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with British warnings; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off threatened NATO
attacks, Yugoslavia's Serb leadership on Friday invited the U.N.
secretary-general to visit, saying that would help him understand
``the real situation in Kosovo.'' But British leaders warned that
time to prevent such attacks was running short.
	   The invitation, carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency,
came only days before Secretary-General Kofi Annan is scheduled to
submit a report on compliance with a U.N. Security Council
resolution, essentially demanding an end to the Kosovo offensive by
Serbian police and the Yugoslav army. And it threatens unspecified
further action if the demand is ignored _ a condition seen by some
NATO countries as opening the door to military intervention.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels seeking
independence for Kosovo has left hundreds dead and more than
270,000 homeless since it began in February. Kosovo is a province
in southern Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   In Pristina, capital of Kosovo province, ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova urged NATO military strikes after a series of
reported massacres of Albanian villagers.
	   ``The most critical issue is to stop the war machine of Belgrade
and to protect the people of Kosovo,'' Rugova told reporters.
``Otherwise we will be seeing other massacres as we've already seen
in the past few weeks.''
	   On Thursday, Britain and the United States failed to persuade
the Russians and Chinese at a new U.N. Security Council meeting to
specifically blame the Serbs for the killings. The council instead
condemned the massacres and urged Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to punish those responsible.
	   Britain, among the most vocal supporters of NATO action as a
last resort, delivered strong warnings on Friday.
	   ``This is a humanitarian disaster,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair
told Channel 4 TV News in London. ``I believe it will only be
stopped if Milosevic gets the clearest possible message ... namely,
if you carry on doing this, you will face a military penalty.''
	   Defense Secretary George Robertson warned the Yugoslav
leadership that the ``clock is ticking.''
	   ``Stop the violence, the cold-blooded murders of innocent
civilians, return your sinister troops to barracks, let the people
return to their homes in safety _ and start negotiating a political
settlement,'' he told a Labor Party conference in Blackpool. ``If
you don't ... then NATO, with Britain playing its full part, will
act decisively in the only way that you, Milosevic, seem to
respect.''
	   In Washington, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said
his government was willing to have international experts take part
in an investigation into the massacres to ``establish and prove the
facts.'' The Foreign Ministry in the capital Belgrade said
invitations went out to forensic experts from Finland. Serb police
have denied responsibility for murdering civilians.
	   The Serbs also announced the withdrawal of combat forces from
battlefields in Kosovo. But ethnic Albanian sources claimed
fighting continued Thursday along the border with Albania, where
separatist guerrillas take sanctuary and Rugova challenged the
claims of pullbacks, saying the government had forces had ``only
changed their tactical position.''
	   He cited a report by the Albanian Human Rights Council which
says more than 1,400 people have been killed in the crackdown
against the Kosovo Liberation Army. The United Nations estimates
more than 50,000 diplaced Kosovars are without shelter _ a source
of concern ahead of winter.
	   In Washington, Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior
Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the United
States and its NATO allies should prepare to launch an air
campaign.
	   ``With the onset of winter only weeks away, a humanitarian
catastrophe looms,'' Biden said in a speech to a foreign-policy
group.
	   Robert Gelbard, the U.S. envoy to the Balkans, said the
massacres have left the Belgrade government with ``no credibility
at all.''
	   ``We have seen atrocities piled on atrocities,'' Gelbard told
the British Broadcasting Corporation on Thursday. ``Our people in
Kosovo ... have verified that these atrocities have occurred.''
	   In the latest allegation, Human Rights Watch said a
self-described survivor of one massacre supplied chilling new
details of alleged atrocities.
	   Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch said a wounded Albanian
reported that he and 13 other men were beaten and shot by Serb
police Saturday. He was the only survivor.
	   Bouckaert said the survivor's story was corroborated by other
witnesses from Golubovac, a village five kilometers (three miles)
from Donje Obrinje, site of another massacre.

England calls off game against Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England has called off next month's exhibition
soccer game against Yugoslavia at Wembley because of the conflict
in Kosovo.
	   According to the English Football Association, the decision was
taken in the light of reports of increased unrest in the Kosovo
region and amid talk of intended United Nations military action
against the Serbs.
	   ``It is obvious that the situation in Kosovo has deteriorated to
an alarming extent,'' the FA's director of public affairs, David
Davies, said Friday.
	   ``Like millions of people around the world, we have been shocked
by informed reports of recent developments.
	   ``The decision to cancel the (Nov. 18) game is ours. To remove
any uncertainty a decision was needed now,'' Davies said.
	   ``We are disappointed not just for England supporters but also
for the Yugoslav community in this country who were looking forward
to the match. We hope it can be rearranged in the not too distant
future.
	   ``Football has the potential, as it has shown in the past, to
bring nations together. But in the right circumstances at the right
time,'' Davies said. ``Now is not that time, nor do those
circumstances exist.''

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Amid mounting concern over the
treatment of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's former deputy,
police on Friday began probing allegations that Anwar Ibrahim was
beaten during his first night in jail.
	   A team led by a police officer from the southern state of
Malacca, not involved in the case, will question the officers
assigned to interrogate the 51-year-old dissident who is
challenging Mahathir's rule.
	   A trial date will be decided after Anwar appears Monday in High
Court for a fresh reading of 10 counts alleging corruption and
illegal homosexual acts, a defense lawyer said. He was expected to
repeat his innocent pleas.
	   With a black eye, and bruises on his neck and arms, Anwar was
arraigned Tuesday and Wednesday. He told the magistrate's courts he
was beaten by police on Sept. 20, the night of his arrest.
	   Mahathir, 72, initially suggested that Anwar had inflicted his
own injuries to gain public sympathy.
	   But as condemnation grew and newspapers worldwide published
pictures of Anwar's welts and bruises, Mahathir ordered an
investigation.
	   No timetable for it has been announced.
	   On Thursday, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged
in a message to Mahathir that Anwar be treated properly in
accordance with the rule of law. Annan said he was heartened by
Mahathir's subsequent statement that the reports of physical abuse
would be investigated.
	   World Bank President James Wolfensohn said he was troubled by
the photographs of Anwar, who was to have played a key role at the
annual meetings of the bank and the International Monetary Fund,
now under way.
	   Wolfensohn called Anwar ``a friend who had a real position in
our group. I hope the world keeps an eye on him and he gets a
chance to state his case.''
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime
minister and finance minister, saying he was morally unfit for
office. The two had differed over economic policy as the country
veered into recession and Anwar has said Mahathir feared him as an
alternative leader.
	   Anwar conducted nationwide rallies calling for Mahathir's
resignation, and thousands of Malaysians continued the protests in
Kuala Lumpur after his arrest.
	   Friday prayers at mosques around the capital ended peacefully,
despite rumors of demonstrations. There were no police at monuments
in the downtown area for the first time this week. And inside the
National Mosque, there was no chanting for Anwar and reform, as had
occurred last week.
	   Meanwhile, Malaysia's Bar Council, angered by police questioning
of a defense attorney who accompanied Anwar's wife to police
headquarters Thursday, scheduled an Oct. 10 meeting to discuss
detentions such as Anwar's under the Internal Security Act. The
British colonial law allows prisoners to be held indefinitely
without charge, often without access to lawyers or family.
	   Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, a former ally of Anwar who was among 17
associates, opposition and ruling party leaders detained this
month, held a news conference Friday to distance himself from the
reform movement. He was freed Wednesday after nine days in
detention, during which he resigned a high ruling party post.
	   The Bar Council described the Internal Security Act as an ``an
obnoxious piece of legislation undermining fundamental human
rights, basic democratic principles and the rule of law.''
	   The council demanded that ``members of the bar who are acting in
the defense of their clients be allowed to carry out their duties
freely without any harassment, hindrance or restraint by the
authorities.''
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, was summoned to police headquarters
Thursday for the third time to answer questions about a television
interview expressing fears for her husband's health. Police also
interrogated her lawyer, and traveled to Singapore to question the
CNBC Asia journalists who interviewed her.

<TEXT>
	   MARIGNANE, France (AP) _ A disgruntled former aerospace employee
hijacked a company plane with 15 people aboard Friday, forcing the
pilot to land at an airport outside Marseille on Friday, officials
said.
	   The plane, identified as a Falcon 20 belonging to Serge Dassault
Aviation, landed at Marseille-Marignane Airport at 12:30 p.m. (1030
GMT) after being hijacked while on a flight from Paris, Marseille
police said.
	   The hijacker, armed with a shotgun and grenades, first demanded
to talk to his lawyer, the police said on customary anonymity.
	   He then released 10 hostages, but continued to hold the pilot
and an undetermined number of other people, police said.
	   Police Prefect Hughes Parant rushed to the airport, where police
and firefighters were deployed around the plane.
	   The plane ferries employees between the corporate headquarters
near Paris and the company's plant in the southern city of Istres.
	   Dassault builds fighter planes including the Mirage and Rafale,
as well as civilian planes including the Falcon.

EU Commissioner Cresson sues Liberation newspaper over defamation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union Commissioner Edith
Cresson has filed suit in a French court case against La Liberation
newspaper for defamation, EU officials said Friday.
	   The case was filed after the Paris daily alleged that Cresson,
the EU research and development commissioner and a former French
prime minister, was involved in irregularities in awarding a
commission contract.
	   Spokesman Jimmy Jamar said she filed the defamation suit because
of ``certain words and interpretations'' in two articles that
appeared in the second half of September.

Latvian referendum overshadows parliamentary poll
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL TARM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Whether to make citizenship easier for the
country's huge ethnic Russian population is the top issue for most
Latvians voting in Saturday's elections.
	   In the third national election since Latvia broke with the
Soviet Union, the electorate will pick a new slate of deputies to
the country's 100-seat parliament, the Saeima.
	   But a simultaneous referendum has drawn most attention in the
voting run-up and which has driven the election campaigns of most
of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats.
	   The controversial referendum, if passed, would nullify
amendments adopted earlier this year liberalizing Latvian
citizenship laws, which place high obstacles to citizenship for
700,000 of Latvia's 1.2 million ethnic Russians.
	   Non-citizens are not eligible to vote on the referendum or in
the election.
	   After Latvia regained independence in 1991, citizenship was
granted automatically to pre-1940 residents and their descendants _
leaving stateless most of the ethnic Russians who poured into
Latvia in the Soviet era.
	   The citizenship amendments, approved by parliament in June, were
supposed to signal that Latvia was ready to integrate the Russians,
who make up some 45 percent of the country's 2.5 million
population.
	   Western governments have warned of their disapproval if the
citizenship amendments are overturned. The European Union has said
turning down the changes could foil Latvia's bid for membership.
	   Russia, which has already denounced Latvian citizenship
policies, is also likely to react angrily if the referendum goes
through.
	   Five of the six parties in Latvia's current government coalition
and all the major opposition parties have called on voters to
reject the referendum and let the amendments stand, stressing the
potential damage to Latvia's image abroad.
	   The right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party, a member of the
governing coalition and the party of Latvian Prime Minister Guntars
Krasts, is the only major party campaigning for a yes-vote in the
referendum.
	   Fatherland and Freedom argues that by softening naturalization
rules Latvia has caved in to Western pressure. Its main campaign
poster, emblazoned by a maroon and white Latvian flag, reads,
``Latvians: Don't give in!''
	   Many voters are expected to split their votes, casting ballots
for moderate parties in the parliamentary poll, but voting for the
referendum. On the eve of the election, observers said the final
referendum result was still too close to call.
	   On issues other than citizenship, like the need to seek EU and
NATO membership, there is wide cross-party agreement. There is also
broad support for the free-market reforms implemented in the
country with such success in recent years.
	   Voter support for one party or another seems to depend less on
the issues, and more on the personality of different party leaders.
	   The party that has been No. 1 in most pre-election polls with
around 20 percent support is the center-right Peoples Party, a new
party founded by wealthy businessman and a former prime minister,
Andris Skele.
	   Skele has said Latvia relies too much on transit trade to and
from Russia, and said policies should also focus on producing goods
in Latvia for export.
	   Other parties scoring around 15 percent in opinion surveys
include the rightist Fatherland and Freedom, the centrist Latvia's
Way and the opposition leftists, the Social Democrats.
	   The centrist News Party, led by flamboyant pop music composer
Raimonds Pauls, is also expected to score above the five percent
threshold required to win parliamentary seats.

Burkina Faso president to visit Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso
will attend Taiwan's National Day celebrations Oct. 10 during a
state visit, the Foreign Ministry said Friday.
	   Blaise will lead a large delegation including several Cabinet
ministers on his third visit to Taiwan, during which he will hold
discussions and sign a joint communique with Taiwan President Lee
Teng-hui, the ministry said.
	   Burkina Faso is one of just 27 countries that have formal
diplomatic relations with Taiwan, claimed by China as a renegade
province with no right to international recognition.
	   Most of Taiwan's allies are poor nations in Africa, Central
America and the Caribbean, and Taipei keeps those ties strong
through loans, investment and development assistance.

NATO will strike back if attacked in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO troops in Bosnia will
protect themselves if attacked in retaliation for involvement in
Kosovo, officials of the defense alliance said Friday.
	   ``We do have contingency plans,'' said Maj. Richard Saint-Louis,
a NATO spokesman in Sarajevo on Friday. ``We would react according
to the level of threat we could asses.''
	   Saint-Louis offered no details in reaction to a threat made
Thursday by Serbian Deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj. Seselj
threatened retaliation against NATO personnel outside Yugoslavia in
case the alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslav army or
Serbian police targets to stop the bloodshed in Kosovo. The
ethnic-Albanian Kosovo province is part of Serbia, the dominant
Yugoslav republic.
	   The president-elect of the Serb half of Bosnia is Nikola
Poplasen, a member of the Bosnian branch of Seselj's Radical party.
That, and the proximity of Bosnia to neighboring Serbia, has raised
concerns about NATO security in the wake of Seselj's threat.

Tanaka takes one-stroke lead in Japan Open golf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HIGASHI-IBARAKI, Japan (AP) _ Hidemichi Tanaka shot a
2-under-par 70 Friday and took a one-stroke lead after the second
round of the 120 million yen (dlrs 882,000) Japan Open Golf
Championship.
	   Tanaka, seeking his second Japan PGA Tour title of the year,
sank five birdies against three bogeys on the 7,160-yard, par-72
Oarai Golf Club course.
	   ``I just kept thinking I wanted to put the ball on the middle of
the green and have a good time grabbing par,'' said Tanaka, who
stood sixth after completing the rained-delayed first round earlier
Friday.
	   His 72-70 put him one shot ahead of Toshimitsu Izawa, overnight
co-leader Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki and Taiwan's Hsieh Chin-sheng.
	   Izawa also had a second-round 70, with four birdies and two
bogeys. Hsieh shot a 71 and Ozaki a 72.
	   American Peter Teravainen shot a 71 Friday and moved into a tie
at 144 with seven other golfers, including money-rankings leader
Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki and defending champion Craig Parry of
Australia.
	   Japan's Koki Idoki, who shared the lead after the first round,
slipped to a 75 and was four shots behind the leader at 146.
	   A total of 62 golfers made the cut at 8-over 152 to advance to
the final two rounds. Sunday's winner will collect 24 million yen
(dlrs 176,000).

Hoddle leaves McManaman, Ince out of Euro squad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England coach Glenn Hoddle has left Liverpool
stars Steve McManaman and Paul Ince out of his squads for the
upcoming European Championship qualifying games against Bulgaria
and Luxembourg.
	   McManaman, who has been struggling with an Achilles tendon
injury, was left out at the request of the Liverpool management and
will miss both the Oct. 10 game at Wembley against Bulgaria and the
visit to Luxembourg four days later.
	   Ince, who was sent off in last month's 2-1 loss to Sweden, is
automatically suspended for the game against Bulgaria and could
receive a further ban because of the gesture he made towards the
fans when he left the field.
	   On that basis, Hoddle hasn't included him at all.
	   Manchester United midfielder David Beckham, who was suspended
for the game against Sweden following his expulsion against
Argentina during the World Cup, will be back in midfield.
	   Newcastle's David Batty has been recalled having missed the game
against Sweden through injury and the fact that he was serving a
six-game domestic ban. Likely he will replace Ince as the
midfielder strongman.
	   Squad:
	   Goalkeepers _ David Seaman (Arsenal), Nigel Martyn (Leeds), Tim
Flowers (Blackburn).
	   Defenders _ Tony Adams (Arsenal), Sol Campbell (Tottenham),
Gareth Southgate (Aston Villa), Martin Keown (Arsenal), Rio
Ferdinand (West Ham), Andy Hinchcliffe (Sheffield Wednesday), Gary
Neville (Manchester United), Graeme Le Saux (Chelsea), Phil Neville
(Manchester United).
	   Midfielders _ Darren Anderton (Tottenham), Ray Parlour
(Arsenal), Robert Lee (Newcastle), David Batty, (Newcastle), Nicky
Butt (Manchester United), David Beckham (Manchester United), Paul
Merson (Aston Villa), Jamie Redknapp (Liverpool).
	   Forwards _ Paul Scholes (Manchester United), Alan Shearer
(Newcastle), Michael Owen (Liverpool), Ian Wright (West Ham), Teddy
Sheringham (Manchester United), Dion Dublin (Coventry).

Daimler-Benz opens 19-building complex at Potsdamer Platz
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ With music and speeches, Daimler-Benz on Friday
inaugurated its 19-building complex at Potsdamer Platz, the former
``crossroads of Europe'' that was leveled during World War II and
bisected for decades by the Berlin Wall.
	   ``This is a miracle for many Berliners,'' Mayor Eberhard Diepgen
told a crowd of 2,500 people, referring to the transformation of
Potsdamer Platz, a Cold War no-man's land, into the city's future
commercial center.
	   The revival of Potsdamer Platz is key to the German government's
move to Berlin next year _ and the new Daimler-Benz complex was one
more sign that that revival was nearing completion.
	   During the celebrations, wide-screen TVs depicted Potsdamer
Platz's history, from a Hitler giving a speech at the site to
Germans tearing down the Berlin Wall in 1990. Choirs and orchestras
performed songs written for the occasion, and German President
Roman Herzog led a tour of the new complex.
	   Before World War II, Potsdamer Platz was one of Europe's busiest
intersections _ and site of the first traffic signal on the
continent. What was not destroyed by Allied bombing during World
War II was torn down when the area became part of the ``death
strip'' between the Wall's two sections.
	   ``Berlin has reclaimed its city center,'' Daimler-Benz chief
Juergen Schrempp said Friday. ``Today, the heart of our city beats
again.''
	   The new Daimler-Benz complex took four years and 4 billion marks
(dlrs 2.3 billion) to build. Surrounding a square named for actress
Marlene Dietrich, the complex has apartments, shops, theaters,
offices and its centerpiece, a 20-story office tower for the
Daimler-Benz's financial service Debis.
	   With its 20 stories of terra-cotta tile, the office tower, open
for almost a year, already has become something of a landmark; a
green, illuminated cube on top of the building is visible for miles
across the city.
	   Italian architect Renzo Piano, who designed the Debis tower,
also oversaw construction of the site's other buildings, designed
by an international team of architects.
	   ``The piazza is the center of a city, of everyday life,'' Piano
told the crowd of Berliners gathered at Marlene Dietrich Square.
``This is a mythological place in Berlin. And 50 years of war will
not be able to kill the life here.''
	   The Daimler-Benz complex is the largest of the many building
projects that have made the 27 acres of Potsdamer Platz the biggest
construction site in Europe. The other big investor, Sony, is
spending $630 million to build its European headquarters on the
site.
	   Daimler-Benz also will celebrate the grand opening by keeping
the site's some 100 shops open until midnight over the weekend.
Stores in Germany usually are open until 4 p.m. on Saturdays and
closed on Sundays.

France easing repayment of Morocco's debt

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Friday said that
France will ease repayment of Morocco's foreign debt, which has
become a huge burden for the North African kingdom.
	   Speaking at a joint news conference with Moroccan Prime Minister
Abderrahmane Youssoufi, Jospin said Paris will set aside 4.2
billion francs (dlrs 760 million) to ease Morocco's debt to France.
	   That debt is currently about 19 billion French francs (dlrs 3.3
billion), or about 17.5 percent of the country's total foreign
debt.
	   Jospin said the debt easing package included easing repayment
terms, credits as well as a lowering of interest rates on the debt
itself, as well as converting some of the debt into investment
credits.
	   About one-third of Morocco's exports are to France, which is the
country's biggest trading partner and a longtime customer for
French companies.
	   ``France is determined to remain Morocco's primary economic
partner, its primary investor and its primary financial
supporter,'' Jospin said before his talks with Youssoufi.
	   Jospin also said that he would support Morocco's efforts to
improve its relations with the European Union.
	   The Moroccan leader said that the debt represented his country's
``most serious difficulty in continuing our economic, financial,
social and human development.''
	   Morocco's foreign debt constitutes about 58 percent of the
country's gross domestic product.
	   Throughout his visit to France which began Wednesday, Youssoufi
has been pressing for an easing of the debt and Jospin's remarks
came as no surprise.
	   ``France has confidence in the Moroccan economy, as it has
confidence in happy outcome of the democratic process that Mr.
Yousouffi's government is carrying out,'' Jospin said.
	   Youssouffi also said that easing Morocco's debt would help
stimulate foreign investment as well as permit the Moroccan
government to address social priorities.
	   The Moroccan prime minister had called for some of the country's
debt to be converted to investment credits and said it would be a
big boost for the economy. He also said easing the debt would help
free funds for Moroccan government to address social priorities.
	   A Socialist, Youssoufi was named prime minister in March by King
Hassan II, breaking three months of political deadlock after
legislative elections that left the country without governing
coalition.
	   In addition to economic issues, Jospin and Youssouffi discussed
political turmoil in Algeria, Morocco's hopes for a lifting of
international sanctions against Iraq and Libya, as well as the
problem of illegal immigration of Moroccan citizens to France.

Syria says Turkish threats are part of Israeli plot against Syria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria responded to reports of Turkish
troops massing along they Syrian border by accusing Turkey of
plotting with Israel to create a crisis with the aim of undermining
Syria.
	   The statements came in government-controlled newspapers Friday,
and Prime Minister Mahmoud al-Zoubi also warned that Syria would
stand up to any action by Turkey.
	   The threats do not represent the opinion of the Turkish people
but are ``an outcome of coordination between Ankara and Tel Aviv
(Israel), based on ... the Turkish-Israeli alliance,'' said an
editorial in Al-Baath, the ruling Baath Party's newspaper.
	   ``The latest Turkish threats are a kind of support to the
Israeli stand and to what (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin)
Netanyahu's government is doing to terminate Syria,'' said the
paper.
	   Al-Zoubi told a meeting of governors and Baath Party officials
Thursday that Syria ``rejects surrender and is a power in the face
of all dangers.''
	   The daily Al-Baath's paper's comments come amid increasing
tension between the two countries over Turkish claims that Syria is
supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels. Turkish papers have reported
that Turkey was massing troops and armored vehicles along its
border with Syria.
	   On Thursday, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel told legislators
that ``our patience is running out,'' and that Turkey retains the
``right to counter Syria.''
	   Turkey's Chief of General Staff, Gen. Huseyin Kivriloglu, said
that ``the current situation is that of an undeclared war.'' But
the air force commander, Gen. Ilhan Kilic, said the military would
step in only if the government failed to find a solution.
	   Turkey's Kurdish rebels carry out cross-border attacks from
bases in Syria, Iraq and Iran. Turkey says the rebels' headquarters
are based in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of Lebanon and that
their leader, Abdullah Ocalan, lives in the Syrian capital
Damascus.
	   Syria has denied sheltering the rebels.
	   Syrian papers focused on the Turkish-Israeli military
cooperation agreement which Damascus views as a threat to the Arab
world.
	   ``Since Syria is standing in the face of the Zionist plan, the
Turkish government insists on creating a dispute with Syria only to
realize Israeli ambitions,'' said al-Baath.
	   Syria's objects to the Turkish-Israeli alliance because the pact
``is not in the interest of the Turkish Muslim people, and is
directed against Arabs and their interests,'' said Al-Baath.
	   Another pro-government paper, Al-Thawra, took a more moderate
line, calling for the ``purifying of relations between the two
countries.''
	   Arguing that the interests of the Turkish people and their
government would not be achieved through alliance with Israel, the
paper said that the Turkish regime is trying to escape from its
internal crisis by creating disputes with Syria.
	   Instead, Turkey's interests ``lie in establishing true relations
with neighboring Arab and Muslim countries, based on dialogue and
mutual interests, not on threat and provocative policy that serves
Israel,'' Al-Thawra said.

Liam Neeson, Natasha Richardson win libel damages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson won 50,000
pounds (dlrs 85,000) in libel damages Friday over newspaper
allegations that she was filing for divorce behind his back and
that their marriage was a sham.
	   The couple said they would donate the money to victims of the
Aug. 15 car bombing in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh, the
worst terrorist strike in the province's 30-year conflict.
	   Neeson, nominated for an Academy Award for his role in
``Schindler's List,'' and Richardson, who won a Tony Award this
year for ``Cabaret,'' had sued the publishers of the Mirror tabloid
for libel and malicious falsehood after publication of the story
last month.
	   Neeson learned of the story from his mother, who phoned him in
great distress after seeing the headlines while out shopping, said
the couple's attorney, Mark Thomson.
	   Neeson was born in Northern Ireland and his family still lives
there. It also is part of the Mirror's circulation area.
	   Martin Cruddace, the lawyer for The Mirror's parent company,
MGN, said the newpaper ``uneqivocally'' accepted that the story was
entirely false and apologized for the embarrassment, hurt and
distress caused to the couple, who have been married for four years
and have two sons.
	   MGN also will pay the couple's legal costs.

Chairman of troubled UBS resigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The chairman of UBS AG resigned
Friday in the wake of the announcement that the Swiss banking giant
will lose 2.2 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 1.61 billion), largely
because of its involvement in a troubled private U.S. investment
fund.
	   In a press release, Mathis Cabiallavetta said ``the conviction
that I can prove my service to the bank with this step moved me to
do this.'' Cabiallavetta declined any ``financial arrangement,''
the bank's chief executive officer Marcel Ospel said.
	   Three other top UBS executives are also leaving, the
announcement said. Ospel wouldn't discuss possible remuneration for
them because of contractual terms.
	   Last Thursday, UBS said it would incur a 950 million franc (dlrs
699 million) charge on its exposure to Long Term Capital
Management, which with other losses will lead to a third quarter
after tax-loss of up to 1 billion francs (dlrs 735 million).
	   An internal inquiry uncovered lapses by managers in controls and
decisions before and after the merger, UBS said. It found no signs
of gross negligence, the bank added.
	   UBS said transactions like LTCM won't reoccur. Ospel called its
LTCM involvement an extremely complex case in which risk was ``very
underestimated.''
	   He said the three executives were aware of that and thus left
the bank, but said Cabiallavetta wasn't aware of all the risks
involved. Ospel said the bank will learn lessons and improve risk
controls.
	   Part of the problem in reconstructing the LTCM case, Ospel said,
was that the fund only updated its partners once a month.
	   For a time, he said, ``we were flying blind.''
	   The transaction with LTCM consisted of an equity investment of
around 270 million dlrs and a complex options structure, he said.
In order to hedge that position UBS bought 800 million dlrs worth
of shares in the fund.
	   For regulatory and accounting reasons, the different legs of the
transaction weren't booked in the same places which is why the
extent of the losses went undetected for a long time, Ospel said.
	   Ospel and interim chairman Alex Krauer said UBS first informed
Swiss federal regulators in early September that market turmoil had
caused the bank problems.
	   Last week, the bank told regulators of its losses' extent and,
later in the week, of the investigation's findings.
	   Krauer, vice-chairman of UBS and also chairman of drug giant
Novartis, told a news conference staff changes wouldn't be enough
to restore confidence in the bank. He regretted the losses but
suggested the negative reaction was ``overdone.''
	   ``We promise to do everything so as to not disappoint,'' he
said, adding that a new chairman would be sought quickly.
	   UBS' management on Monday reassured employees in a memo it
remained sound and that it was investigating.
	   The bank said executives leaving by ``mutual agreement'' include
Felix Fischer, chief risk officer of UBS; Werner Bonadurer, former
co-chief operating office of Warburg Dillon Read; and Andrew
Siciliano, former head of rates at Warburg.
	   After an early rise Friday to 302 francs (dlrs 222) a share,
which dealers said reflected enthusiasm at the management shake-up,
at 0913 GMT UBS shares were back down to 267 francs (dlrs 196).
	   Stock market analysts said Friday more still needs to be done to
convince participants of UBS' long-term profitability, in
particular detailed announcements of what the bank plans to do to
prevent similar mishaps in the future. ``Confidence hasn't been
restored yet,'' said Gerd Ramsperger, analyst at Zuercher
Kantonalbank's brokerage research.

Israel deports four Lebanese from occupied zone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli security agents in occupied
southern Lebanon on Friday expelled two couples whose sons were
involved in anti-Israeli activities, Lebanese security officials
said.
	   Israeli forces and their allies of the South Lebanon Army
militia in the occupied zone have in the past punished by expulsion
inhabitants deemed a security threat.
	   The four Druse men and women walked some four kilometers (2.5
miles) to a Lebanese army checkpoint on the edge of the occupied
zone.
	   They were interrogated by Lebanese army officers on the reasons
for their expulsion before they were allowed to drive to Beirut,
the officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Two of the four, Fawaz Munzir, 42, and his wife Adiyeh Munzir,
46, are the parents of Naji Munizer, who killed Nidal Nasr, a
suspected collaborator with Israel and its proxy Lebanese militia.
	   The body of Nasr, a Syrian, was found in a valley in the eastern
sector of the occupied zone Wednesday.
	   In July, Nasr had replaced Raja Ward, a senior South Lebanon
Army security official who fled the Israeli occupation zone and
provided the Lebanese army with information that led to the arrest
of 17 people suspected of spying for Israel.
	   The other two who were expelled are Ward's parents, Mahmoud
Ward, 80, and Zahra Namour, 75.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen
from the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to shield its northern towns
against cross-border guerrilla attacks.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The money-losing state power company
increased its charges by 20 percent Friday, with four more hikes of
15 percent each to be staggered over the next year.
	   The Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority said it wanted to
increase power charges by 37 percent to meet escalating running and
maintenance costs, but settled on an immediate 20 percent hike
after talks with the government.
	   The agreement was to ``cushion consumers against the adverse
impact of steep one-off increases,'' the company said in a
statement.
	   About 45 percent of Zimbabwe's power is imported from neighoring
Mozambique, South Africa and Zambia.
	   The statement said the weakening of the Zimbabwe dollar against
the U.S. dollar by 70 percent since November lost the company about
300 million Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 30 million), both on paying for
the imports and servicing loans for imported equipment.
	   The government, fearing panic buying and possible unrest, says
it has agreed to food price increases of about 20 percent over the
next few weeks, lower than food producers demanded.
	   At least six people died in food riots in January
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The Chinese-built, dlrs 30 million Nelson
Mandela sports stadium outside the Ugandan capital stands empty
most of the time because it is too big, too far and too expensive,
the stadium chairman said Friday.
	   Algeria meets Uganda Friday in a first-leg qualifying match for
the 2000 Africa Cup of Nations in the much smaller, older, closer
and cheaper Nakivubo stadium in Kampala.
	   Balamaze Lwanga, chairman of the three-year-old Mandela stadium
that seats 40,000, said rates for use of the stadium are usually
negotiated with soccer teams and begin at around dlrs 2,000 and go
to around dlrs 4,000.
	   The cost of floodlights for night games and security influence
the fee.
	   Officials of the Federation of Uganda Football Association said
it does not have that kind of money.
	   ``Teams fear insufficient crowds at Mandela stadium and also
don't like the traffic jams,'' Lwanga said.
	   The Chinese government has built huge soccer stadiums and sports
complexes in many African countries. They often stand idle for lack
of operating funds.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ President Yoweri Museveni returned to
Uganda Friday after a three-day visit to Libya, where he joined
other African leaders in congratulating Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi on his 29 years in power.
	   Museveni and the presidents of Chad, Niger and Eritrea all broke
a U.N. air embargo against Libya imposed for its failure to hand
over for prosecution two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a U.S.
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Museveni made no comment on his return. But a statement from his
office said he and the other leaders had held talks with Gadhafi on
``developments taking place on the African continent and how to
promote closer unity and cooperation among nations.''
	   It is widely believed that the leaders discussed the conflict in
Congo to which Chad has sent at least 1,000 troops to support
President Laurent Kabila. The Congolese leader accuses Uganda and
Rwanda of backing the eight-week rebellion to oust him.
	   --
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South African Airways will
from Saturday resume scheduled flights to Kinshasa, the airline
said Friday.
	   SAA's commercial flights to the Democratic Republic of Congo
were suspended because of the civil war.
	   ``The situation has returned to normality and it is now safe to
operate commercial flights to Kinshasa,'' SAA said in a statement.
	   --
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's
house was broken into and ransacked but it was unclear if anything
was stolen, her security spokesman said Friday.
	   Sipho Zimba said the burglar apparently entered the property in
Soweto on Thurday night by climbing a wall surrounding it. One set
of footprints was found.
	   ``I don't know what he wanted there. It is very strange,'' Zimba
said.
	   Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela is the former wife of President Nelson
Mandela.

Slovaks try unsuccessfully to get foreign currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Exchange offices around the capital
had no hard foreign currency available for exchange early Friday,
one day after the National Bank allowed the currency to float
freely.
	   ``I only have 400 American dollars left, but you should buy them
now, because later there will be none,'' said a bank official at
Bratislava's Investicna a Rozvojova Banka.
	   The bank was the only financial institution in downtown
Bratislava Friday still buying and selling U.S. dollars, which
climbed 4 crowns overnight to 39 crowns. Even exchangers on the
black market, had no dollars or German marks Friday.
	   The National Bank's decision to no longer guarantee the fixed
exchange rate of the crown was expected to considerably devalue the
currency. This is due to the combination of the current account
deficit, created mostly by the foreign trade deficit and a deficit
in the public sector, combined with the parliamentary elections,
the bank said Thursday.
	   Opposition politicians criticized the government of outgoing
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar for the current state of the Slovak
crown. Meciar was ousted after last week's national elections, in
which his governing party was outpolled by opposition parties.
	   ``They held the crown on a certain level, and now they want to
put the blame on us,'' said Rudolf Schuster, the chairman of the
opposition Party of Civic Understanding.
	   The leader of the largest opposition Slovak Democratic Coalition
Mikulas Dzurinda, said Friday that the new parliament should be
called in as soon as possible, so that measures can be taken to
stabilize the currency.
	   The new parliament has to be called by Oct. 29, but so far no
dates have been set.
	   Businesses were preparing Friday for the value of the currency
to continue dropping. Rajo, Slovakia's largest dairy producer said
it will raise its prices, Anna Chudikova, a company representative
said.
	   ``We will know specifically how much next week. Right now it is
hard to predict,'' said Chudikova.

Report: Israel fears attacks on holy sites during millennium
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Fearing attacks during the millennium, Israel
has conducted anti-terror drills at Jerusalem holy sites and
considers asking the United States and Europe for help in spotting
fanatics among Christian pilgrims, a newspaper said Friday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed that the
government's anti-terrorism adviser, Meir Dagan, has proposed
security measures to deal with millions of Christian pilgrims
expected in the Holy Land between 1999 and 2001.
	   Netanyahu spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said Dagan drew on
information provided by the Shin Bet security service and police
intelligence, but would not discuss the proposals made.
	   Israel expects that millions of Christian pilgrims will visit
the Holy Land in the next four years to mark the 2000th anniversary
of Jesus' birth. Some experts believe that among the visitors will
be thousands who believe the end of the world and the second coming
of Christ are near.
	   Kol Ha'ir, the Israeli weekly, said Netanyahu's anti-terror
adviser considered several scenarios, including that Christian
extremists attack Jerusalem holy sites to trigger an apocalyptic
bloodbath that would pave the way for redemption.
	   The weekly said special police units have carried out
anti-terrorist drills at holy places and that a police committee
has been set up to identify extremists among the pilgrims.
	   Security will be stepped up at Christian, Jewish and Muslim holy
places and state-of-the-art protective devices are to be installed,
the newspaper said.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin referred all questions to
Dagan's office.
	   The plan also calls for tougher security checks at airports.
Pilgrims will be required to show a return ticket and a reservation
at a hotel or other accommodation in Israel, the paper said.
	   Dagan also proposes that Israel enlist the help of the United
States and European governments in pinpointing extremists, Kol
Ha'ir said.

Parliament commission to probe intelligence scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A parliamentary commission on Friday
summoned four prominent officials to examine an unprecedented
public airing of rifts within the governing party and possibly
recommend penalties against those involved.
	   Last week, two aides of President Franjo Tudjman, Hrvoje Sarinic
and Franjo Greguric, accused another advisor, Ivic Pasalic, of
coordinating a campaign against a moderate wing of the Tudjman's
governing Croatian Democratic Union.
	   They alleged that Pasalic, a nationalist skeptical of Western
ideas, enlisted support from the nation's military
counterintelligence, known as SIS, to eliminate rivals from the
political arena by smearing their reputations via the media,
especially the tabloids.
	   Pasalic denied the claims, while the head of SIS, Gen. Markica
Rebic, refused to comment.
	   The parliamentary commission, entrusted with examining breaches
of national security, summoned the four to appear Oct. 12.
	   The affair brought into the open a long-standing rift inside the
ruling party between pro-Western moderates and nationalist
hard-liners, in what appears to be struggle for dominance if
Tudjman steps down.
	   Tudjman, 77 is in his last term and is widely rumored to be
seriously ill.

State Duma: NATO attack over Kosovo would be unprovoked aggression
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament declared Friday that any NATO
military action over Kosovo taken without U.N. approval would be
considered an ``illegal act of aggression.''
	   In a resolution passed unanimously by a vote of 359 to 0, the
State Duma lower house of parliament said it would review all
agreements between NATO and Russia if the western alliance were to
opt for force against Yugoslavia.
	   Such a decision ``may cause irreparable harm to the
international security system fixed in the U.N. Charter,'' the
resolution said.
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution passed last week urges a
cease-fire and threatens to consider ``further action and
additional measures'' if the belligerents continue fighting in
Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia.
	   The NATO allies have not yet resolved their differences over
whether a further U.N. resolution is needed to launch airstrikes.
NATO authorities requested Thursday that the member countries come
forward with specific offers of weapons for possible airstrikes,
but a final decision about whether to use force won't likely be
made until next week.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov warned that ``if a single bomb or
rocket is dropped in Serbia, the Yugoslav army will retaliate ...
and this can trigger a full-scale war,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   The Duma said it would consider renewing military-technical
cooperation with Yugoslavia in the event of a NATO strike.
	   It called on both sides in the Kosovo conflict to cease fighting
and start peace talks, and appealed to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to fulfill the agreement he struck with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin in Moscow in June.
	   That agreement called for Yugoslav authorities to provide
security for the civilian population of Kosovo, create conditions
for the return of refugees and prosecute those responsible for
crimes against civilians.

 &UR; Ex-employee hijacks corporate plane
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with hijacker surrendering

<TEXT>
	   MARIGNANE, France (AP) _ A disgruntled former aerospace employee
hijacked a company plane with 15 people aboard Friday, forcing the
pilot to land at an airport outside Marseille, officials said.
	   The plane, identified as a Falcon 20 belonging to Serge Dassault
Aviation, landed at Marseille-Marignane Airport at 12:30 p.m. (1030
GMT) after being hijacked while on a flight from Paris, Marseille
police said.
	   The hijacker, armed with a shotgun and grenades, first demanded
to talk to his lawyer, the police said on customary anonymity.
	   He then released 10 hostages unharmed but continued to hold the
pilot and an undetermined number of other people. He released the
rest of his hostages and surrendered about two hours after the
plane landed, police said.

Bosnia owes 8 million marks to various organizations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's debt to various
international organizations totals nearly 8 million marks (dlrs 4.8
million), including 1.5 million marks (dlrs 900,000) to the United
Nations, the Onasa news agency reported Friday.
	   Bosnia is the only country created in the break-up of Yugoslavia
that has not regularly paid its membership dues to the United
Nations, the daily Oslobodjenje reported.
	   Present-day Yugoslavia, comprised of Serbia and Montenegro, is
not a member of the international organization.
	   Bosnian officials hope to set aside 3 million marks (dlrs 1.8
million) as soon as possible to begin paying the country's
obligations.
	   The money for the budget comes from tax collections and customs
duties.
	   Because of the amount of debt, the Foreign Ministry has been
asked to make a list of priorities for payment. The three-man joint
presidency then will have to sign off on the list.
	   The Foreign Ministry is expected to make paying off debt to the
United Nations the first priority, Oslobodjenje reported. The
country also would pay half of what it owes to the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency,
the World Health Organization and Interpol.
	   ``We have chosen these organizations because they have a
significant number of projects in our country. The non-payment of
contributions could cause revoking of those projects,'' a Foreign
Ministry source told Oslobodjenje.

Swissair flight forced to land at Vienna airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A Swissair flight from Bucharest to
Zurich made an unscheduled stop in Vienna on Friday after an
anonymous caller in Bucharest said a bomb was on board, officials
said.
	   The plane, an Airbus A320 carrying 68 people, flew on to
Switzerland nearly four hours later after no bomb was found, said
Mario Sante, a spokesman for Vienna International Airport.
	   Police removed all the baggage and mail and questioned the
passengers but learned nothing about a possible bomb, officials
said.
	   In Romania, the Transport Ministry said the call was received a
half-hour after Flight 461 left at 8:42 a.m. (0542 GMT).
	   The plane landed in Vienna at 8:31 a.m. (0631 GMT) and left at
12:17 p.m. (1017 GMT), Sante said.
	   In Zurich, Swissair spokesman Erwin Schaerer said it landed
safely at Kloten airport at 1:30 p.m. (1130 GMT).
	   The airline had no indication of a motive behind the bomb threat
or where it came from, Schaerer said.
	   Romania's central bank governor, Mugur Isarescu, was among the
32 Romanian passengers on board, on his way to Washington for a
meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, a
Bucharest radio station reported.

Singaporean partner drops out of Myanmar Airways International
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Spelling Myanma correct, grafs 2 and 7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The foreign partner in Myanmar's flag
carrier, Myanmar Airways International, has withdrawn its
investment in the joint venture, airline industry officials said
Friday.
	   Highsonic Enterprise Pte. Ltd. of Singapore began joint-venture
operations with the state-owned Myanma Airways in August 1993. The
airline initially flew from the Myanmar capital, Yangon, to
Bangkok, Singapore and Hong Kong.
	   The pullout became effective Monday. Local staff were informed
last week that the Singapore partner was pulling out due to
economic difficulties.
	   It was not immediately known whether the Myanmar government
would continue to run the airline alone or if new foreign
shareholders would be found.
	   A Myanmar Airways International official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, declined to give details about how big Highsonic's
investment had been.
	   Myanmar Airways International originally leased aircraft from
Royal Brunei Airlines, and used the airline's pilots and
maintenance personnel. It later expanded its service to Dhaka,
Bangladesh, and leased two planes from Malaysian Air Services,
together with air crews and maintenance staff.
	   The airline was the first joint venture between Myanma Airways
and a foreign partner.
	   In November 1994, Air Mandalay, a joint venture with Mandalay
Holdings of Singapore, began a domestic service, adding flights to
the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai in August 1995.

Norway appoints new governor for state central bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A top finance ministery official, Svein
Gjedrem, was appointed Friday as the new governor of the state Bank
of Norway for a six-year term.
	   Gjedrem, 48, will assume leadership of the central bank on Jan.
1, following the retirement of current bank governor Kjell Storvik,
a finance ministry statement said.
	   The new bank governor currently holds the highest civil service
post in the finance ministry, as finance advisor. He also worked as
a consultant at the Bank of Norway from 1975 to 1979.
	   Gjerdrem, an economist, joined the finance ministry in 1979. He
was seen as a solid and uncontroversial figure, who is likely
maintain the bank's distance from political meddling.
	   ``He's got a good reputation for knowing the subject and being a
strong personality,'' said Marius Loemo, senior analyst at
Christiania Markets brokerage in Oslo.
	   Gjedrem was one of 10 applicants for the job, including the
current deputy central bank governor Jarle Bergo.
	   The finance ministry sets Norway's monetary policy, while the
central bank uses interest rates and other measures to reach the
country's goal of maintaining a stable value for its national
currency, the krone.

Russian banker gets five years in jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ In what is the first jail term for
a foreign financier, Russian banker Alim Karmov was sentenced to
five years for asset mismanagement, CTK news agency reported.
	   In 1995, Karmov set up the Futurum Aurum investment fund in the
Czech Republic, using lavish TV ads to attract individual
investors.
	   One year later he announced that the moeny had money
disappeared.
	   He was arrested, admitted to fraud and publicly called himself a
``Russian beast'', apologizing to Czech creditors.
	   As it turned out, he used the fund's full assets worth over one
million dollars to pay debts of his private construction company.
	   Karamov's activity was seen as an attempt to use Russian mafia
practices such as pyramid schemes in the Czech Republic, but such
allegations have not been substantiated.
	   Karmov's sentence of five years was appealed by both the
prosecution and the defendant.
	   Financial mismanagement normally carries a sentence of five to
twelve years.

Chairman of troubled UBS resigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The chairman of UBS AG resigned
Friday in the wake of the announcement that the Swiss banking giant
will lose 2.2 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 1.61 billion), largely
because of its involvement in a troubled private U.S. investment
fund.
	   In a press release, Mathis Cabiallavetta said ``the conviction
that I can prove my service to the bank with this step moved me to
do this.'' Cabiallavetta declined any ``financial arrangement,''
the bank's chief executive officer Marcel Ospel said.
	   Three other top UBS executives are also leaving, the
announcement said. Ospel wouldn't discuss possible remuneration for
them because of contractual terms.
	   Last Thursday, UBS said it would incur a 950 million franc (dlrs
699 million) charge on its exposure to Long Term Capital
Management, which with other losses will lead to a third quarter
after tax-loss of up to 1 billion francs (dlrs 735 million).
	   An internal inquiry uncovered lapses by managers in controls and
decisions before and after the merger, UBS said. It found no signs
of gross negligence, the bank added.
	   UBS said transactions like LTCM won't reoccur. Ospel called its
LTCM involvement an extremely complex case in which risk was ``very
underestimated.''
	   He said the three executives were aware of that and thus left
the bank, but said Cabiallavetta wasn't aware of all the risks
involved. Ospel said the bank will learn lessons and improve risk
controls.
	   Part of the problem in reconstructing the LTCM case, Ospel said,
was that the fund only updated its partners once a month.
	   For a time, he said, ``we were flying blind.''
	   The transaction with LTCM consisted of an equity investment of
around 270 million dlrs and a complex options structure, he said.
In order to hedge that position UBS bought 800 million dlrs worth
of shares in the fund.
	   For regulatory and accounting reasons, the different legs of the
transaction weren't booked in the same places which is why the
extent of the losses went undetected for a long time, Ospel said.
	   Ospel and interim chairman Alex Krauer said UBS first informed
Swiss federal regulators in early September that market turmoil had
caused the bank problems.
	   Last week, the bank told regulators of its losses' extent and,
later in the week, of the investigation's findings.
	   Krauer, vice-chairman of UBS and also chairman of drug giant
Novartis, told a news conference that staff changes wouldn't be
enough to restore confidence in the bank. He regretted the losses
but suggested the negative reaction was ``overdone.''
	   ``We promise to do everything so as to not disappoint,'' he
said, adding that a new chairman would be sought quickly.
	   UBS' management on Monday reassured employees in a memo that the
bank remained sound and that it was investigating.
	   The bank said executives leaving by ``mutual agreement'' include
Felix Fischer, chief risk officer of UBS; Werner Bonadurer, former
co-chief operating office of Warburg Dillon Read; and Andrew
Siciliano, former head of rates at Warburg.
	   After an early rise Friday to 302 francs (dlrs 222) a share,
which dealers said reflected enthusiasm at the management shake-up,
at 0913 GMT UBS shares were back down to 267 francs (dlrs 196).
	   Stock market analysts said Friday more still needs to be done to
convince participants of UBS' long-term profitability, in
particular detailed announcements of what the bank plans to do to
prevent similar mishaps in the future. ``Confidence hasn't been
restored yet,'' said Gerd Ramsperger, analyst at Zuercher
Kantonalbank's brokerage research.

Election bets indicate possible upset Labor victory

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A surge in bets favoring a Labor
victory in Saturday's election had tightened the odds on the
result, said Australia's biggest private betting agency, CentreBet.
	   A Labor win had started out at 2-1 Friday morning but firmed to
7-4 by evening and was expected to shorten even further before
betting closed at 2 p.m. Saturday, the Alice Springs-based agency's
manager, Gerard Daffy, said.
	   Prime Minister John Howard's governing conservatives had drifted
from 1-3 to 2-5 to win and its odds looked likely to lengthen again
by Saturday.
	   ``On that basis, Labor is looking pretty strong for an upset
win,'' Daffy said.

UN human rights top calls for urgent action in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Top UN human rights official Mary Robinson
on Friday condemned violence against civilians in Kosovo and called
for urgent action to stop the slaughter in the Yugoslav province.
	   ``It is terrible and I believe definitely that very serious
positive action is needed,,'' the U.N. High Commission for Human
Rights said at a news conference in Oslo. She did specify what
action.
	   The United Nation's security council has condemned the massacres
of ethnic Albanians the Serb-run Kosovo province of Yugoslavia.
NATO has threatened attacks on Serb positions unless Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic withdraws his troops.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels seeking
independence for Kosovo has left hundreds dead and more than
270,000 homeless since it began in February. Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up about 90 percent of the 2 million population, is
in southern Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   After massacres last weekend, at least 18 civilians were found
murdered at one site alone in the Drenica region.
	   Robinson said she could not second guess the U.N. security
council, which could order military intervention.
	   ```But I do find it unacceptable that we talk about human rights
... and then watch this level of violence unfold,'' Robinson said.
	   Robinson was in Oslo to open a human rights symposium called by
Norway, her own office and the U.N. Human Development program. At
the symposium, a broad range of experts were discussing global
human rights issues.
	   In her keynote address, Robinson said human rights abuses are
still widespread, 50 years after the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was adopted.
	   ``The international community has not been able to stop the
genocide in Cambodia or Rwanda, the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia (or)
the tragic situation in Kosovo,'' she said.
	   At a news conference afterwards, Robinson said her office was
attempting to set up a small office in Pristina, the capital of
Kosovo ``to focus on the terrible reality of the situation.''
	   Robinson also said she took the rare step of issuing a statement
on Kosovo Thursday to protest the murder of men, woman and
children.
	   ``These killing are particularly reprehensible because they are
evidence that, despite expressions of international concern and
official (Yugoslav) assurances that civilians would be respected,
atrocities are continuing in Kosovo,'' her statement said.

Coast guard: Owners of sunken ferry negotiating oil slick cleanup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Owners of a Philippine ferry that
sank outside Manila Bay are negotiating on payment for cleaning up
oil from the ship that has threatened beach resorts, coastal
villages and marine life, the coast guard said Friday.
	   The coast guard has spent 2 million pesos (dlrs 45,450) for
chemicals and fuel to battle the oil slick from the Princess of the
Orient, which sank Sept. 18 in stormy weather off Batangas
province, south of Manila, said coast guard chief of staff Capt.
Herbie Escutin.
	   At least 70 people died and 80 others are still missing from the
sinking of the ferry, which carried 505 people.
	   Escutin said the coast guard is asking Sulpicio Lines for an
initial deposit of 5 million pesos (dlrs 113,600) to buy additional
materials and chemicals needed for the cleanup.
	   He said the company previously had ignored the demands, but
began negotiating after the coast guard warned that it might face
charges or a suspension of its franchise.
	   With some 50,000 liters (13,160 gallons) of oil seeping from the
ship, the coast guard said the slick has reached several coastal
areas in Cavite province and metropolitan Manila.
	   In some areas, the slick is two inches (5 centimeters) thick. It
has disrupted and could destroy oyster and fish farms. It could
also affect a number of beach resorts and damage marine resources.
	   The ferry, on its way to central Cebu province, was carrying at
least 600,000 liters (160,000 gallons) of fuel oil and 11,000
liters (3,000 gallons) of lubricant oil, Coast guard spokesman Lt.
Joel Garcia said.
	   Sulpicio Lines has a total of 32 ships. It also owned the Dona
Paz, a ferry that collided with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in
the world's worst peacetime shipping disaster. A year later, 250
people died in the sinking of another ship owned by the company,
the Dona Marilyn.
	   The captain of the Princess of the Orient has not been found,
and some officials believe he is in hiding.
	   Maritime officials have allowed three of Sulpicio's seven ships
with designs similar to that of the sunken ferry to return to sea

Stable prices seen easing Philippines' inflation pressures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Stabilizing prices, especially for
food, are expected to have eased inflation pressures in the
Philippines in September.
	   Economists polled on Friday forecast September inflation at 10.4
percent year-on-year, lower than August's 10.5 percent rate. The
data will be released Monday.
	   In the eight months through August, inflation averaged 9.3
percent, lower than the government's target of 10 percent this
year. Inflation hit double digits in May for the first time in
nearly two years, when it reached 10.3 percent.
	   Economists no longer expect average inflation to breach the 10
percent mark this year as the impact of a drought attributed to the
El Nino weather phenomenon on agricultural production is declining.
	   However, the impact of expected heavy rains later this year has
yet to be measured.
	   Still, economists are confident that the government is prepared
to import food staples such as rice, corn and sugar in the event of
a shortage in agricultural production in the fourth quarter. This
would prevent prices from shooting up.
	   ``Food prices have been stabilizing and we expect this trend to
continue,'' said Ricky Lozari, an economist at Abacus Securities
Inc.
	   Noel Reyes, research head at Anscor Hagedorn Securities Inc.,
predicts a further decline in food prices next year as agricultural
production is not expected to be affected substantially by weather
disturbances.
	   Agricultural production is crucial in determining Philippine
inflation as it makes up around half of the consumer price index.
	   Reyes also pointed to recent steady interest rates as an
indication of minimal inflationary pressures.
	   ``We don't expect any upticks in inflation for the rest of the
year and steady interest rates are certainly helping,'' he said.
	   Audi Pantillano, an economist at Securities 2000 Inc., said
inflation has ceased to become a major concern in Philippine
financial markets.
	   ``Unless there is a major, unexpected movement, the currency and
equities market no longer react strongly to consumer prices,'' he
said.
	   Economists say regional market developments, such as the
movement of the yen, are now being more closely monitored by
participants in local financial markets.

Congolese rebels take fight to the Internet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to restore dropped ``m'' in campaign in lede &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels have taken their two-month
campaign to oust President Laurent Kabila to the Internet.
	   ``We have to explain to the world audience who we are and what
we're fighting for,'' rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said on
Friday. ``Besides, the (Kabila) government has been using the
Internet to tell their side of the story.''
	   The 56-year-old history professor at the University of Dar es
Salaam in Tanzania said supporters of the Congolese Rally for
Democracy in the United States have created a web site for the
rebellion.
	   The site _ www.prairienet.org/panafrican/cdm _ has been set up
on the donor-supported Prairenet Community Network in eastern
Illinois.
	   The rebels are a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted
members of Kabila's army and political opponents who accuse Kabila
of power-grabbing, mismanagement, corruption and sowing dissent
among Congo's 400 tribes.
	   After an initial lightning advance in the far west of Africa's
third-largest nation, the rebels were stopped at the outskirts of
the capital, Kinshasa, by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia,
who are backing Kabila.
	   Since then, the rebels have been confined to a chunk of
territory in the extreme eastern part of the country where their
rebellion was declared Aug. 2.
	   Wamba said the rebels control 40 percent of Congo, an area of 15
million people.
	   So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels,
accusing them of being the puppets of neighboring Rwanda and
Uganda.
	   Posting the rebel mission statement on the Internet is just part
of the media campaign.
	   Last week, Wamba dispatched two of his top aides to the United
States and Europe to lobby for political support and raise public
awareness about the conflict in Congo.
	   ``World leaders, diplomats and are not familiar enough with our
cause. They still talk about Tutsis leading the rebellion. Well,
I'm not a Tutsi,'' Wamba said.
	   Jacques Depelchin, the movement's vice president and a former
lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley, met in
Washington earlier this week with the U.S. special envoy in the
Great Lakes region of Central Africa, Howard Wolpe and with
congressmen, Wamba said.

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A surge in bets favoring a Labor
victory in Saturday's election has tightened the odds on the
result, said Australia's biggest private betting agency, CentreBet.
	   A Labor win had started out at 2-1 Friday morning but firmed to
7-4 by evening and was expected to shorten even further before
betting closed at 2 p.m. Saturday, the Alice Springs-based agency's
manager, Gerard Daffy, said.
	   Prime Minister John Howard's governing conservatives had drifted
from 1-3 to 2-5 to win and their odds looked likely to lengthen
again by Saturday.
	   ``On that basis, Labor is looking pretty strong for an upset
win,'' Daffy said.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said Friday he is not too choosy about who will be his successor.
	   The man need not necessarily be very religious and only
preoccupied with doing virtuous deeds at all times, the national
news agency, Bernama, quoted Mahathir as saying after Friday
prayers at the Al-Falah Mosque in the northern town of Jitra in
Kedah state.
	   ``It is sufficient that the person does things acceptable by the
people,'' Mahathir said.
	   So far Mahathir, 72, has designated three heirs-apparent during
his 17-year rule. One resigned. Another challenged Mahathir for
leadership of the ruling party, and lost.
	   On Sept. 2, he fired the last one, Anwar Ibrahim, calling him
morally unfit for office. Anwar mounted a nationwide campaign
against the prime minister before being detained as a national
security risk and charged with illegal homosexual acts and
corruption in connection with those allegations.
	   Mahathir told reporters later that Anwar had been working toward
toppling him as prime minister and president of the governing
coalition's dominant party, the United Malays National
Organization.
	   ``He appeared very good to me but he was actually planning ways
of bringing me down. At first, I did not believe when people told
me about this, but I now know this to be true,'' said Mahathir.
	   Mahathir said Anwar had arranged for his supporters to contest
for and gain control of the UMNO divisions so that he could win the
party's top post in next year's party elections.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Solemn-faced Kenyans whose relatives were
killed in the terrorist bombing of a U.S. Embassy collected
benefits on Friday they said failed to compensate for their losses.
	   ``It's not enough, nothing could be enough,'' Beatrice Akoth
Yongo, a widow with four young children and another due in
December, said in the shade of a flowering jacaranda tree.
	   Attorney-General Amos Wako, representing the government at the
gathering of 100 in downtown Uhuru Park, acknowledged with regret,
``This is peanuts for someone who has died.''
	   Yongo was one of 31 relatives paid 100,000 Kenyan shillings
(dlrs 1,667) each from donations that have reached 228 million
Kenyan shillings (dlrs 3.8 million).
	   They came, some from days away, and wore their Sunday best.
Several shed tears as they accepted checks from smiling officials
offering condolences.
	   In the coming days, more of the 213 Kenyan families who lost a
relative will be compensated, said Charles Njonjo, chairman of the
National Disaster Emergency Fund.
	   Many families previously received an immediate payment of 50,000
Kenyan shillings (dlrs 833) for burial expenses. Additional
payments will be made, if money becomes available, Njonjo said.
	   A total of 248 people, including a dozen Americans, were killed
in the Nairobi bombing on Aug. 7. A twin attack on the U.S. Embassy
in neighboring Tanzania killed 11 people, all Africans.
	   Compensation later will be paid to the most seriously injured
among more than 5,400 people who were hurt in Kenya, mostly
passersby sliced by flying debris, Njonjo said. Amounts have not
been determined.
	   Nearly two months after the bombings, many people still need
physical and psychological help, and not enough is being provided,
aid agencies say.
	   ``The needs are very serious and we keep identifying more and
more as the days go by,'' said Amimo Agola of the Bomb Relief
Support Unit, an umbrella group for all nongovernmental agencies
assisting bomb victims.
	   A total of 17 people remain in hospital for treatment of serious
physical injuries, including broken limbs and backs and
amputations, the National Disaster Operations Center said.
	   Another 200 people need reconstructive surgery, Agola said.
Meanwhile, mangled eyelids are failing to protect otherwise
undamaged eyes, hands with severed tendons are turning into useless
claws.
	   Patients, although unable to work and lacking medical insurance,
must now pay for treatment that initially was free.
	   Most rehabilitation programs need money, too, Agola said.
	   For example, 97 people were fully or partially blinded by flying
glass and debris, and need training that the Kenya Society for the
Blind can't always afford to provide. Many patients can't afford to
buy the powerful eyeglasses they need.
	   ``The greatest need is that many, many of us have been
psychologically traumatized, and very, very few are receiving
help,'' Agola said.
	   Businesses have started to fire people who have not yet returned
to work because they are still upset by the bombing, she said.
	   Especially heartbreaking are the pleas from people who say
they've lost the family's only breadwinner.
	   In Kenya, as in much of Africa, strong ties of the extended
family _ and the enormous disparity between earnings in the city
and the countryside _ make it common for one urban breadwinner to
be the main source of support for dozens of other family members.
	   The government's social welfare system is hopelessly inadequate,
and life insurance is a luxury of the rich.
	   Some people were angry at the paucity of assistance.
	   ``This is nothing,'' Esther Dalizu said, waving a compensation
check. Her dead sister was a senior bank employee who had earned
the same amount in just a few months. ``The loss cannot be
compensated.''
	   Dalizu said she planned to save the money for the education of
her sister's 11-year-old daughter.
	   Yongo, 32, said without her husband's salary the family now must
live on her earnings of less than half as much. After she pays the
rent on a government-subsidized apartment, she has just 1,200
shillings (dlrs 20) per month to feed her brood, pay utilities and
school fees.
	   ``It has been so difficult,'' she said, blotting away a tear.
Relatives cannot afford to help her.
	   Yongo is afraid her husband's dream of university educations for
their children has died with him. ``This makes me even sadder,''
she said.

Facilities for Bangkok's Asian Games almost ready, organizers say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Organizers of December's Asian Games
have dismissed press reports that a sports complex would not be
completed on time, saying preparations are well in hand, a local
newspaper said Friday.
	   Santiparb Tejavanija, deputy secretary of the Bangkok Asian
Games Organizing Committee, said construction of the sports complex
at the Muang Thong Thani housing estate is 95 percent complete and
will be finished this month, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   Liquidity problems at Bangkok Land, the company that owns the
housing estate, threatened to prevent the company from finishing
the complex in time for the Dec. 6-20 games.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, who chairs the
organizing committee, expressed doubt last month that the complex
would be completed on time because of the financial problems.
	   Santiparb told the Post the money problems had been overcome by
shifting 200 million baht (dlrs 5 million) worth of credit
guarantees from a project that had been scrapped to cover the
construction cost of the complex.
	   Preparations for the games have been plagued by political
interference by previous governments, alleged corruption and
incompetence.
	   The decision to award the contract for the sports complex was
controversial, with critics calling it an attempt to bail out the
property developer's failed housing estate.
	   Doubts over Thailand's ability to stage the games increased over
the past year-and-a-half after the country entered its worst
economic downturn in decades.
	   The body governing the games threatened several times to award
Asia's version of the Olympics to other countries, but Thailand
argued that all would be ready by opening day.
	   The Bangkok games are expected to attract more than 10,000
athletes from 43 nations.

Greek author Lili Zografou dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Lili Zografou, a prolific author whose
work often dealt with Greece's turbulent politics and social
inequities, died Friday. She was 76.
	   Ms. Zografou died at a hospital on her home island of Crete a
week after suffering a stroke, hospital officials said.
	   She first appeared on the literary scene in 1949 with her novel
``Love'' and established her career 10 years later with a highly
praised essay on Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis.
	   Ms. Zografou also worked as a journalist and contributed
articles to a variety of publications.
	   Many of the Zografou's 24 books were deeply laced with political
themes and commentaries on social issues, particularly the status
of women in Greek society.
	   The targets of her political critiques were varied. She
denounced the 1967-74 military dictatorship in books such as ``Your
Wife the Tramp'' (1984) and ``Occupation: Whore'' (1978). But she
also was an outspoken foe of the late Socialist Premier Andreas
Papandreou.
	   Nikos Konstantopoulos, president of political group Coalition of
Leftist Forces, said Ms. Zografou was ``always on the radical
forefront of spiritual and social pursuits ... close to personal
pain and to the unyielding battle for social rights and political

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Dozens of street children, some only
four-year-old, demonstrated outside Colombo's city hall Friday,
demanding that their rights be protected.
	   ``We need love,'' ``Let's say no to child labor,'' read placards
carried by 57 children. Their hour-long protest was organized by
World Vision Lanka, a child rights group.
	   Child sex trade on the island's palm fringed beaches has brought
a bad name to Sri Lanka which thrives on tourism. As many as 30,000
boys are estimated to be involved in sex trade.
	   Children also are exploited as workers in Sri Lankan homes and
workplaces.
	   ``We want to educate people of the rights of children,'' said
Nilanka Jayasuriya of the World Vision Lanka.
	   In August, the Sri Lankan parliament adopted a tough legislation
outlawing child labor and setting a Child Protection Authority with
wide powers to investigate sex abuses.

Washington tries to negotiate understanding on unilateral steps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank ( AP) _ The United States is trying to coax
a pledge from Israel not to expand Jewish settlements, in exchange
for assurances from the Palestinians that they will not encourage
illegal construction, a Palestinian negotiator said Friday.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton has offered each side a letter
guaranteeing that the other will refrain from certain unilateral
steps, said the negotiator, Saeb Erekat.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians have accepted the proposed trade,
but that ``I don't know this morning where Mr. Netanyahu stands on
these issues,'' referring to the Israeli prime minister.
	   The United States has intensified efforts to conclude a
long-overdue agreement on an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent
of the West Bank.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will arrive in the
Middle East on Tuesday to try and narrow the gaps ahead of an Oct.
15-19 Mideast summit in Washington, Erekat said.
	   During her two-day stay, Albright will meet Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis
Ross, will accompany her and stay on until Oct. 12.
	   Earlier this week, Clinton hosted Netanyahu and Arafat in a
three-way summit and also held separate talks with the leaders.
	   Erekat said U.S. officials proposed a trade under which each
side would refrain from a number of unilateral steps.
	   ``We will be asked in an American-Palestinian understanding, for
instance, not to question Israel's credentials at the United
Nations,'' Erekat told a Palestinian-European conference in
Ramallah.
	   The Americans also proposed that the Palestinian Authority
coordinate with Israel on the granting of construction permits in
West Bank areas still under Israeli control, the negotiator said.
	   In exchange, Israel would agree not to expand Jewish settlements
and not to demolish some 1,800 Palestinian homes built without
permits.
	   An Israeli official said he was not familiar with the U.S.
proposal, but said it was highly unlikely Israel would agree to
such a trade. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.

Congolese rebels take fight to the Internet

Democratic Coalition to conform to style &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels have taken their two-month
campaign to oust President Laurent Kabila to the Internet.
	   ``We have to explain to the world audience who we are and what
we're fighting for,'' rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said on
Friday. ``Besides, the (Kabila) government has been using the
Internet to tell their side of the story.''
	   The 56-year-old history professor at the University of Dar es
Salaam in Tanzania said supporters of the Congolese Rally for
Democracy in the United States have created a web site for the
rebellion.
	   The site _ www.prairienet.org/panafrican/cdm _ has been set up
on the donor-supported Prairenet Community Network in eastern
Illinois.
	   The rebels are a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted
members of Kabila's army and political opponents who accuse Kabila
of power-grabbing, mismanagement, corruption and sowing dissent
among Congo's 400 tribes.
	   After an initial lightning advance in the far west of Africa's
third-largest nation, the rebels were stopped at the outskirts of
the capital, Kinshasa, by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia,
who are backing Kabila.
	   Since then, the rebels have been confined to a chunk of
territory in the extreme eastern part of the country where their
rebellion was declared Aug. 2.
	   Wamba said the rebels control 40 percent of Congo, an area of 15
million people.
	   So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels,
accusing them of being the puppets of neighboring Rwanda and
Uganda.
	   Posting the rebel mission statement on the Internet is just part
of the media campaign.
	   Last week, Wamba dispatched two of his top aides to the United
States and Europe to lobby for political support and raise public
awareness about the conflict in Congo.
	   ``World leaders, diplomats and are not familiar enough with our
cause. They still talk about Tutsis leading the rebellion. Well,
I'm not a Tutsi,'' Wamba said.
	   Jacques Depelchin, the movement's vice president and a former
lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley, met in
Washington earlier this week with the U.S. special envoy in the
Great Lakes region of Central Africa, Howard Wolpe and with
congressmen, Wamba said.

UN human rights top calls for urgent action in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; CORRECTS typos in grafs 2 and 3.
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Top UN human rights official Mary Robinson
on Friday condemned violence against civilians in Kosovo and called
for urgent action to stop the slaughter in the Yugoslav province.
	   ``It is terrible and I believe definitely that very serious
positive action is needed,,'' the U.N. High Commission for Human
Rights said at a news conference in Oslo. She didn't specify what
action.
	   The United Nations Security Council has condemned the massacres
of ethnic Albanians in the Serb-run Kosovo province of Yugoslavia.
NATO has threatened attacks on Serb positions unless Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic withdraws his troops.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels seeking
independence for Kosovo has left hundreds dead and more than
270,000 homeless since it began in February. Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up about 90 percent of the 2 million population, is
in southern Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   After massacres last weekend, at least 18 civilians were found
murdered at one site alone in the Drenica region.
	   Robinson said she could not second guess the U.N. security
council, which could order military intervention.
	   ```But I do find it unacceptable that we talk about human rights
... and then watch this level of violence unfold,'' Robinson said.
	   Robinson was in Oslo to open a human rights symposium called by
Norway, her own office and the U.N. Human Development program. At
the symposium, a broad range of experts were discussing global
human rights issues.
	   In her keynote address, Robinson said human rights abuses are
still widespread, 50 years after the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was adopted.
	   ``The international community has not been able to stop the
genocide in Cambodia or Rwanda, the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia (or)
the tragic situation in Kosovo,'' she said.
	   At a news conference afterwards, Robinson said her office was
attempting to set up a small office in Pristina, the capital of
Kosovo ``to focus on the terrible reality of the situation.''
	   Robinson also said she took the rare step of issuing a statement
on Kosovo Thursday to protest the murder of men, woman and
children.
	   ``These killing are particularly reprehensible because they are
evidence that, despite expressions of international concern and
official (Yugoslav) assurances that civilians would be respected,
atrocities are continuing in Kosovo,'' her statement said.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A billionaire son of former President
Suharto was interrogated Friday as a suspect in the alleged misuse
of loans made to an insolvent bank that he partly owns.
	   Bambang Trihatmodjo, second son of the autocratic former leader,
just smiled as he left the National Police headquarters where he
was interrogated for four hours.
	   He refused to answers questions by dozens of reporters.
Plainclothes policemen pushed away photographers.
	   Maj. Gen. Da'i Bachtiar, the police chief of detectives, said
earlier that Bambang ``has been summoned as a suspect because of
his position as a commissioner of Bank Andromeda.''
	   Bambang controls 25 percent of the shares of the bank, which was
among 14 closed last November for allegedly violating lending
limits set by the central bank, Bank Indonesia.
	   The major shareholder, with a 50 percent stake, is Prajogo
Pangestu, an ethnic Chinese timber tycoon.
	   Police are investigating possible violations of banking laws,
and about 160 bankers have come under scrutiny.
	   Bambang, who used to head one of the country's biggest business
conglomerates, is the first member of the Suharto family to be
interrogated on charges of corruption.
	   Police earlier had interrogated a number of executives of the
bank.
	   Suharto quit as president in May amid widespread protests and
riots fueled by the worst economic crisis in decades in the world's
fourth most populous country.
	   A government team is investigating whether the 77-year-old
ex-president illegally enriched himself, his family and close
associates during his 32-year rule.
	   Bambang was accompanied during the interrogation by his lawyer,
O.C. Kaligis.

Ukrainian president calls for `corrections' to market reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma called Friday for
``corrections'' to Ukraine's program of market reforms, but pledged
that reforms would continue.
	   Kuchma did not elaborate in his comments to a group of Ukrainian
economists, saying only that the changes were necessary because of
the country's economic problems.
	   Kuchma urged the economists to come up with recommendations
before a national meeting of economists in November, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Ukraine has suffered economic problems since the 1991 collapse
of the Soviet Union and it has been especially hard hit by the
financial crisis in neighboring Russia, its main trading partner.
	   The Russian crisis has hurt bilateral trade, caused the
Ukrainian currency to fall and led to a withdrawal of investors
from Ukraine.
	   In recent months, Kuchma has implemented some economic reforms
by decree, prompting the International Monetary Fund to release the
first installment of a long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan. Many
reforms, however, remain stalled.
	   National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko left this week for
consultations with IMF officials in Washington. Yushchenko has
warned that the bank would not spend its dwindling reserves to
support the hryvna currency, but has avoided comments on the
currency in recent days.
	   There are wide expectations in Ukraine that the hryvna will fall
even further, and Ukrainians have been stocking up on food,
clothing and household goods to save their fast-devaluing money.

Presidential election: suspense, few candidates, one voter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's presidential race is more
suspenseful than most. Though the vote must be held by Oct. 23, the
likely favorite has yet to declare, and the single voter who will
really choose the winner has yet to decide.
	   ``The Elections Are Lost Between Fast Track and Delay,'' said a
headline in the newspaper Ad-Diyar Friday, describing the confusion
over Lebanon's first new head of state to be chosen in peacetime in
nearly three decades.
	   Most Lebanese agree no one can win without approval in advance
from Lebanon's dominant neighbor, Syria. Once Syria gives its view,
the 128-member Parliament elects the president which, under the
constitution, it must do by Oct. 23 to allow a transition before
President Elias Hrawi leaves office Nov. 24.
	   Although there are no campaign rallies or fiery speeches, the
race dominates newspapers and TV news. The news is all about
backroom wrangling and trips to Damascus, a three-hour drive away,
by politicians seeking signals from Syria.
	   And despite their lack of say in the outcome, most Lebanese are
hoping a new head of state will bring much needed optimism _ and
political stability _ as the nation still struggles to recover from
the devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   As it is now, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's multibillion dollar
reconstruction program has been repeatedly stymied by feuding among
the nation's president, prime minister and Parliament speaker.
	   The most popular candidate with the public _ although he has not
declared his candidacy _ is the army commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud,
who enjoys good relations with Syria.
	   Still, Syrian President Hafez Assad has not sent word on how he
will cast his all-important ballot.
	   ``It is still early,'' Hariri said this week after a visit to
Damascus, replying to a question about when the presidential
question would be decided.
	   In this tiny, politically weak country of 3.2 million people,
the choice has always depended on outside forces _ Syria, the
United States and Lebanon's traditional patron France _ as well as
competing interests inside the country.
	   But Syria, which maintains 30,000 troops here, now has a much
stronger say over who will be Lebanon's president.
	   ``Syria names, America may or may not approve and Europe is
notified,'' commentator Gibran Tueini wrote in a recent editorial
in the independent daily An-Nahar.
	   Still, Syria must consider internal factors such as public
acceptance of the candidate _ especially the Christian view since
the president is always a Maronite Catholic under a tradition that
makes the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker
a Shiite Muslim.
	   Lahoud, 62, faces an array of declared and undeclared
candidates, prominent among them are three Cabinet ministers and
three opposition politicians.
	   But for Lahoud to have a shot at the nation's highest office,
the constitution must be amended to allow active senior state
employees to run.
	   That shouldn't be a problem. Three years ago, when Hrawi's
single, constitutionally limited six-year term was running out, the
pro-Syrian Parliament created an extension desired by Syria. And
another extension this time around is still not completely ruled
out.
	   While awaiting Assad's word may be frustrating, it's better than
the violence surrounding the presidency during the civil war when
two elected heads of state were assassinated.
	   One elected president, Bashir Gemayel, was killed in a bomb
explosion 10 days before he could take office in 1982. In 1989,
President Rene Mouawad was assassinated after only 17 days in
office.

UNICEF director ``troubled'' after meeting child fighters

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ The United Nations Children's Fund
urged Sierra Leone's government Friday to disarm the country's
legion of child warriors and give amnesty to rebel youngsters
captured in battle.
	   Speaking to journalists during a two-day visit, UNICEF executive
director Carol Bellamy said she was ``troubled'' after meeting a
contingent of child Kamajor, or Civil Defense Force, soldiers a day
earlier during a whistle-stop tour in the country's interior.
	   ``UNICEF is very clear that children should not be put into
combat positions, or be made messengers or be sexually abused in
fighting forces,'' Bellamy said after meetings with the president
and other government ministers.
	   Sierra Leone has more than 4,000 child soldiers by U.N.
estimates, and many observers believe the real figure is much
higher.
	   During her visit, Bellamy attended a mock demobilization
ceremony of child soldiers in the town of Bo north about 350
kilometers (220 miles) northwest of the capital, Freetown. There,
children danced and sang for Bellamy and other UNICEF and
government officials.
	   Many of the children _ who wore elaborate traditional dresses
and headgear carried guns and ranged in age from 7 to 17 _ told
journalists they wished to go to school but also enjoyed killing
``the wicked enemy,'' a reference to members of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front.
	   Some of the children had up to two years of battle experience.
	   Kamajor leaders said that they were waiting for funding from the
government and United Nations before the children would come home
from the bush and take up civilian life.
	   ``We need money for the demobilization. The children have
nothing to go back to and need support for technical schooling and
re-integration into their communities,'' said John Lawundeh, the
Kamajor commander of the Komboya district surrounding Bo.
	   The Kamajors, traditional fighters who believe they are
protected from harm by their spiritual beliefs, are allied with
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government and Nigerian-led West
African intervention troops who restored Kabbah to power in March.
	   Kabbah was deposed in a bloody armed coup in May last year by
military troops allied to the rebels and led by Lt. Col. Johnny
Paul Koroma, who has since gone into hiding.
	   Bellamy said both sides in the continuing conflict in the
interior ``bear responsibility'' to demobilize child soldiers and
end the recruitment children to their ranks.
	   The RUF have been accused of kidnapping children to join their
cause while several Kamajor children told journalists they were
prompted to fight after members of their families were killed,
maimed and raped by rebels.
	   Although figures are not available, aid workers believe several
thousand of people have injured or killed in fighting since March.

Police reform commission starts public hearings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ An international commission
created as part of Northern Ireland's peace agreement opened
hearings Friday on the future of the predominantly Protestant
police force.
	   April's peace agreement empowered the Independent Commission on
Policing, led by former Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, to
recommend ways to make the Royal Ulster Constabulary more
acceptable to the north's large Roman Catholic minority. It is
supposed to report by mid-1999.
	   Many Catholics consider the 91 percent Protestant force to be
biased against them. Police commanders say the biggest deterrent to
recruiting Catholics has been the Irish Republican Army's
traditional threat to kill them.
	   The seven commissioners _ including a Massachusetts
law-enforcement executive and Canadian and American university
criminologists _ heard testimony from labor unions, business groups
and the province's most hard-line Protestant party, the Democratic
Unionists.
	   Democratic Unionist justice spokesman Ian Paisley Jr. appealed
to the commission to recognize the RUC's successful defense of
Northern Ireland versus the IRA, which killed 300 members from 1970
to 1997, and to keep it intact, including the ``royal'' in its
name.
	   Paisley annoyed some commissioners when he called them
``puppets'' of the British and Irish governments, which cosponsored
the Belfast accord. The Democratic Unionists opposed the accord
because it included the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, which wants the
RUC disarmed and disbanded.
	   ``We wouldn't be sitting here as members of a commission if
there was any preordained outcome. That would be anathema to each
one of us,'' said Sir John Smith, former deputy commander of
London's Metropolitan police who once tried to become the RUC's
commander.
	   Meanwhile, South Africa's Desmond Tutu completed a two-day visit
to Northern Ireland by meeting the Protestant leader of the
province's new cross-community government, David Trimble.
	   The retired Anglican archbishop, who won a Nobel prize for his
activism against apartheid, said Thursday night at Queen's
University that successful peacemakers should avoided making ``too
many preconditions.''
	   That comment appeared aimed at Trimble, who is refusing to let
Sinn Fein participate in the new multi-party administration until
the IRA starts disarming.
	   Standing beside a jovial Trimble, Tutu emphasized that South
Africa's transition wasn't directly applicable to Northern Ireland.
	   ``We would be utterly, utterly presumptuous if we came along and
we said, `Now here is the blueprint.' That would be totally,
totally unacceptable,'' said Tutu, who on Thursday met Sinn Fein
leader Gerry Adams.
	   Also Friday, five more IRA prisoners serving life sentences for
murder were freed from the anti-terrorist Maze prison southwest of
Belfast. Such early paroles under terms of the accord began last
month.
	   Each prisoner had served eight to 14 years. One had been
convicted of killing a deputy governor of the prison.

 &UR; Smart Car goes on sale across Europe &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The long-awaited Smart Car, a tiny,
cartoonish-looking two-seater that can nip into the smallest
parking spot, went on sale across Europe on Friday.
	   Developed by Micro Compact Car AG, a joint venture between
luxury German car giant Daimler-Benz and the Swiss manufacturer of
the Swatch wristwatch, Schweizerische Gesellschaft, the car's debut
was delayed six months after it flunked the so-called ``moose
test,'' mimicking a driver swerving to avoid an unexpected
obstacle.
	   The 720-kilogram (1,587-pound) vehicle flipped over during the
test, proving an embarrassment for luxury-oriented Mercedes Benz as
it sought to enter the subcompact market.
	   The makers say the problem _ related to the car's suspension _
has now been solved with a ``multitude'' of technical alterations.
These included adding an electronic sensor system and modifying the
undercarriage, said Daimler-Benz spokesman Wolfgang Riecke.
	   The car is on sale in Germany, Italy, France, Spain,
Switzerland, Austrian, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg in
special ``Smart Centers,'' which bypass normal auto dealers.
	   The company planned to examine the car's market potential in the
United States, Riecke said, but there were no immediate plans to
sell it there.
	   Riecke said interest has been high in Europe, but declined to
give figures on orders, saying numbers were not available for all
of the countries where it was being sold.
	   Micro Compact Car (MCC) said late last year that the technical
improvements and delayed sales would cost about 300 million marks
(dlrs 170 million) for this and next year.
	   The 2.5-meter (yard) long car takes up just about half of a
standard parking spot. Makers hope that will help it become the
city car of choice.
	   The Swatchmobile, as it also is known, runs on around a third
less gas - it uses just 4.8 liters per 100 kilometers (60 miles) -
than rivals already on the road, such as Ford's Ka and Volkswagen's
Polo.
	   With its bright yellow and red colors, mix-and-match replaceable
parts and all-plastic body, the car is aimed at a young market.
	   Three models went on sale Friday - the basic Smart and Pure,
which retails at around dlrs 8,500; the fancier Smart and Pulse,
which has a sun-roof; and the Limited One, with leather seats and
air-conditioning.
	   Riecke dismissed concerns about the car's tiny size and lack of
a crumple zone. It's black or silver frame _ buyer's choice _ will
envelop occupants ``like a stable nut,'' he said.

Britain warns against travel in Yugoslavia; England calls off

soccer game &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain on Friday warned its citizens not to
travel to Yugoslavia, and England canceled a soccer match with
Yugoslavia because of the situation in Kosovo.
	   ``British nationals in the Federal Republica of Yugoslavia are
advised to consider leaving,'' the Foreign Office said.
	   ``Those who choose to remain should be fully prepared to leave
the country at very short notice.''
	   The English Football Association earlier announced its decision
to cancel the Nov. 18 match against Yugoslavia, which was to be in
London.
	   ``The decision to cancel the game is ours. To remove any
uncertainty a decision was needed now,'' said David Davies, the
association's director of public affairs.

Mubarak: Israel's seeks to hide military buildup by criticizing
</HEADLINE>
Egypt &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak lashed out at Israel
for questioning Egypt's motives in improving its armed forces,
saying that Israel was trying to divert international attention
from its own military build-up.
	   The real question that should be asked is ``why you (Israel)
improve your forces and weapons, upgrade your rockets and launch
spy satellites despite having signed peace agreements with a number
of Arab countries,'' Mubarak said in an interview with the Armed
Forces magazine.
	   The current uproar in the Israeli media is ``nothing more than a
cover and a curtain ... for what Israel is doing,'' said Mubarak.
The text of the interview was carried by Egypt's Middle East News
Agency Friday.
	   Mubarak said that the Israeli media was attempting to divert
attention from the Israeli-Turkish military pact, and that similar
blasts against Egypt were launched to coincide with Israel's
purchase of F-15 A fighter planes and other weaponry.
	   In comments that are among his most vociferous against Israel,
Mubarak also said that it was not Israel's right alone to develop
its armed forces.
	   ``Is it Egypt which increases its military expenditure in a
horrific way every year?'' asked Mubarak, in comments coinciding
with the 25th anniversary of Egypt's 1973 October War against
Israel.
	   ``And is it asked of us that we leave our weapons without
upgrade or maintenance while you procure the latest weapons,'' he
said, also questioning why Israel had not yet signed the Nuclear
non-Proliferation Treaty.
	   Israel has never acknowledged owning nuclear, biological or
chemical weapons but foreign intelligence and defense agencies say
it has all three. Western intelligence reports say Israel is the
only nuclear power in the Middle East and has a significant
stockpile.
	   Mubarak also criticized Israeli claims that it is Egypt that is
standing in the way of peace in the region by encouraging
Palestinians not to accept Israel's proposals.
	   ``If it was not for Egypt, there wouldn't have been peace in the
region at all,'' he said, adding that the Palestinians have the
right to decide for themselves what to accept.
	   If it is asked that Egypt pressure the Palestinians into
accepting an agreement not in their interests, then ``No, one
thousand nos,''' said Mubarak.
	   Egypt, which in 1979 became the first Arab country to sign a
peace treaty with Israel, has been sought to help Israel and the
Palestinians reach an agreement.
	   But, like its Arab neighbors, it has accused Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's of refusing to honor agreements
signed with previous Israeli governments.

Ukrainian president calls for `corrections' to market reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS penultimate graf to CORRECT that bank chief back from
Washington. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma called Friday for
``corrections'' to Ukraine's program of market reforms, but pledged
that reforms would continue.
	   Kuchma did not elaborate in his comments to a group of Ukrainian
economists, saying only that the changes were necessary because of
the country's economic problems.
	   Kuchma urged the economists to come up with recommendations
before a national meeting of economists in November, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Ukraine has suffered economic problems since the 1991 collapse
of the Soviet Union and it has been especially hard hit by the
financial crisis in neighboring Russia, its main trading partner.
	   The Russian crisis has hurt bilateral trade, caused the
Ukrainian currency to fall and led to a withdrawal of investors
from Ukraine.
	   In recent months, Kuchma has implemented some economic reforms
by decree, prompting the International Monetary Fund to release the
first installment of a long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan. Many
reforms, however, remain stalled.
	   National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko was in Washington this
week for consultations with IMF officials. Yushchenko has warned
that the bank would not spend its dwindling reserves to support the
hryvna currency, but has avoided comments on the currency in recent
days.
	   There are wide expectations in Ukraine that the hryvna will fall
even further, and Ukrainians have been stocking up on food,
clothing and household goods to save their fast-devaluing money.

Poles demand explanation of cyanide pollution by Czech factory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland has demanded an explanation
officials in Prague after a Czech steel works dumped cyanide into
the Oder River that forms a border between the neighboring
countries, and failed to alert Warsaw.
	   Experts were called to investigate Monday after dead fish were
reported in the Oder near the Polish-Czech border. Tests found
cyanide pollution, but the amount present does not pose a threat to
humans, an Environmental Protection Ministry spokeswoman, Katarzyna
Karpinska, said Friday.
	   The spill originated at a steel works in Ostrava, about 10
kilometers (six miles) from the Czech-Polish border.
	   Poland's Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek raised the problem
during talks with his Czech counterpart Jan Kavan in the northern
Czech town of Sychrov on Thursday.
	   ``I asked Mr. Kavan to clarify the issue. Poland and the Czech
Republic have signed an agreement on exchange of information on
such accidents,'' Geremek told the PAP news agency.
	   International law also requires that authorities inform
neighboring countries of pollution.

Farazijn admits possession of EPO, denies using it
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgian cyclist Peter Farazijn of the
embattled Lotto team has admitted possessing endurance drug EPO but
denied ever using it. The Lotto team has also denied any
wrongdoing.
	   The Belgian federation said Friday it planned to rule on the
issue after next week's world championships in the Netherlands.
Farazijn is not part of the Belgian world championship team.
	   Belgian newspapers cited Farazijn saying he had personally
bought 12 vials of EPO and stashed it away.
	   When police searched his home part of an investigation into
alleged drug use within the Lotto team earlier this year, Farazijn
voluntarily turned over the vials, the reports said.
	   ``Maybe I'll become the only cyclist in the whole world who will
be punished for having EPO without ever using it,'' he was quoted
as telling the Het Volk newspaper. ``How stupid can you be?''
	   Farazijn was quoted saying he had not yet used the drug because
he wanted to do it with proper medical guidance.
	   ``The story is not credible but it is the bitter truth,'' the
paper quoted him as saying.
	   Farazijn was part of the Lotto team that participated in the
Tour de France this summer, when a drug scandal overshadowed
cycling's premier event.
	   ``There is no hurry since the season is over in ten days. We'll
do whatever we have to do afterwards,'' said federation chairman
Laurent De Backer.

<TEXT>
	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Michael Slater and Steve Waugh both
hit centuries and led Australia to 237 for four Friday, within 32
runs of Pakistan's first innings total on the second day of their
first test.
	   Australia was struggling at 28 for three before lunch, but
rallied in the afternoon session in reply to Pakistan's first
innings total of 269.
	   Slater, a double century-maker in the tourists' four-day warm-up
game in Karachi, continued his fine form with 108 while Waugh hit
an unbeaten 104.
	   The two combined for a 198-run fourth-wicket partnership before
Mohammad Hussain broke the four-hour stand shortly before close of
play.
	   Hussain, the left-arm spinner, had Slater caught at short extra
cover by Mohammad Wasim, who dropped a sitter at short leg off
Saqlain Mushtaq when Slater was on 66.
	   Pakistan, whose lineup includes three specialist spinners,
toiled hard to break both batsmen.
	   The Australians tumbled to 28 for three before lunch when
paceman Wasim Akram removed captain Mark Taylor and Justin Langer
off successive deliveries.
	   Akram, back into the team after leading Lancashire to runner-up
position in the County Championship in England last month, had
Taylor caught behind for three in his fourth over.
	   The left-arm paceman then removed Langer leg before.
	   Slater reached his eighth test hundred and second against
Pakistan with a forceful on drive off Saqlain Mushtaq for his 11th
four of the innings.
	   Waugh completed his 15th test century shortly before close in a
similar fashion, driving Hussain to cover boundary. His century
contained nine fours and a six over mid-wicket off Mushtaq.
	   Stuart MacGill was the best of the Australian bowlers, finishing
off the Pakistani innings with five for 66 while McGrath had two
for 83.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Solemn-faced Kenyans whose relatives were
killed in the bombing of a U.S. Embassy on Friday collected
benefits that they said failed to compensate their losses.
	   ``It's not enough, nothing could be enough,'' Beatrice Akoth
Yongo, a widow with four young children and another due in
December, said in the shade of a flowering jacaranda tree.
	   Attorney-General Amos Wako, representing the government at the
gathering of 100 in downtown Uhuru Park, acknowledged with regret,
``This is peanuts for someone who has died.''
	   Yongo was one of 31 relatives each paid 100,000 Kenyan shillings
(dlrs 1,667) from donations that have reached 228 million Kenyan
shillings (dlrs 3.8 million).
	   The relatives came, some from days' journey away, and wore their
Sunday best. Several shed tears as they accepted checks from
smiling officials offering condolences.
	   In the coming days, more of the 213 Kenyan families who lost a
relative will be compensated, said Charles Njonjo, chairman of the
National Disaster Emergency Fund.
	   Many families earlier received 50,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs
833) for burial expenses. Additional payments will be made, if
money becomes available, Njonjo said.
	   A total of 248 people, including a dozen Americans, were killed
in the Nairobi bombing on Aug. 7. A twin attack on the U.S. Embassy
in neighboring Tanzania killed 11 people, all Africans.
	   U.S. investigators accuse Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden, a
Saudi Arabian living in exile in Afghanistan, of plotting and
paying for the attacks.
	   The two suspects in custody in New York _ Mohamed Sadeek Odeh
and Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali _ are charged with conspiring
to carry out the bombings. Both have links to bin Laden.
	   Compensation later will be paid to the most seriously injured
among more than 5,400 people hurt in Kenya, mostly passersby sliced
by flying debris, Njonjo said. Amounts have not been determined.
	   Nearly two months after the bombings, many people still need
physical and psychological help, and not enough is being provided,
aid agencies say.
	   ``The needs are very serious and we keep identifying more and
more as the days go by,'' said Amimo Agola of the Bomb Relief
Support Unit, an umbrella group for all nongovernmental agencies
assisting bomb victims.
	   A total of 17 people remain in hospital for treatment of serious
physical injuries, including broken limbs and backs and
amputations, the National Disaster Operations Center said.
	   Another 200 people need reconstructive surgery, Agola said.
Meanwhile, mangled eyelids are failing to protect otherwise
undamaged eyes, hands with severed tendons are turning into useless
claws.
	   Flying glass and debris from the blast fully or partially
blinded 97 people who need training that the Kenya Society for the
Blind can't always provide. Many patients can't afford to buy the
powerful eyeglasses they need.
	   ``The greatest need is that many, many of us have been
psychologically traumatized, and very, very few are receiving
help,'' Agola said.
	   Businesses have started to fire people still upset by the
bombing who have not returned to work, she said.
	   Especially heartbreaking are the people who have lost the
family's only breadwinner.
	   In Kenya, as in much of Africa, strong ties of the extended
family _ and the enormous disparity between earnings in the city
and the countryside _ make it common for one urban breadwinner to
be the main source of support for dozens of other family members.
	   The government's social welfare system is hopelessly inadequate,
and life insurance is a luxury.
	   Some people were angered by the paucity of assistance.
	   ``This is nothing,'' Esther Dalizu said, waving a compensation
check. Her dead sister was a senior bank employee who had earned
the same amount in just a few months. ``The loss cannot be
compensated.''
	   Dalizu said she would save the money for the education of her
sister's 11-year-old daughter.
	   Yongo, 32, said without her husband's salary the family now must
live on her earnings of less than half as much. After she pays the
rent on a government-subsidized apartment, she has just 1,200
shillings (dlrs 20) per month to feed her brood, pay utilities and
school fees.
	   Yongo, is afraid her husband's dream of college for their
children has died with him. ``This makes me even sadder,'' she
said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Government officials on Friday denied any
intention to ban Russians from buying foreign currency and said
they would decide how to deal with the economic crisis after
consulting with international lenders.
	   Responding to media reports of a government economic plan that
would prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars and other foreign
currency, a Kremlin spokesman said that President Boris Yeltsin is
strongly opposed to such a move.
	   ``That would bring back the Iron Curtain,'' said presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko also dismissed any
proposal to ban the circulation of foreign currency as a ``mad
idea.''
	   He and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov headed to Washington
for talks with the International Monetary Fund.
	   Before leaving, Zadornov met with leaders of the lower house of
parliament, the State Duma, to discuss how the government planned
to pay its debts to state-funded institutions.
	   Nikolai Kharitonov, head of the Agrarian Party faction, said the
government's crisis program ``is most likely to be composed after
we check our watches with the IMF, that is, when it becomes clear
what we can count on _ only on ourselves or on some outside
support,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Thursday that he might be
forced to take ``unpopular measures'' to salvage the Russian
economy if the IMF didn't come through with more money.
	   Russia has been trying to pressure the lending agency into
releasing the second, dlrs 4.3 billion installment of a loan that
was approved in July, a month before the country's economy crashed
and the government effectively defaulted on its foreign loans.
	   The IMF credit would allow Russia to come out of the crisis
``with minimum losses,'' Primakov said. Without the loan, he added,
``We will take measures _ measures that may be quite unpopular. We
will not throw our country to the winds.''
	   The business daily Kommersant said that the Cabinet has drafted
a budget for the fourth quarter of 1998 with a deficit nearing 100
billion rubles (around dlrs 6 billion), which is to be financed
almost entirely by the IMF loan.
	   ``The government's short-term program will depend on whether we
get dlrs 4.3 billion following the talks in America (with the
IMF),'' First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov said at a news
conference on Friday.
	   IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to come
up with a sound economic program before the loan is given, and have
made it clear that currency controls and boosting the money supply
by printing rubles are not acceptable.
	   The government was reportedly considering an economic plan
loaded with just such measures. The blueprint was prepared by Yuri
Maslyukov, a Communist who is first deputy prime minister in charge
of economic strategy. Maslyukov served as the last chairman of the
Soviet central planning agency.
	   Liberal politicians and the media have criticized the plan as an
effective reversal of free-market reforms and return to the
Soviet-style command economy.
	   ``It's a program of combating the ruble's convertibility and
closing the Russian economy,'' former prime minister Yegor Gaidar,
who initiated Russia's free-market reforms in 1992, said on Friday,
according to Interfax.
	   Primakov insisted, however, that the plan published in
Kommersant is just one of six alternatives his Cabinet is
considering.
	   A government session on Thursday considered Maslyukov's plan but
refused to accept it after Zadornov's sharp criticism, Kommersant
said Friday.

U.N. human rights official calls for urgent action in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The top U.N. human rights official on Friday
condemned violence against civilians in Kosovo and urged urgent
action to stop the slaughter in the majority ethnic Albanian
province.
	   The U.N. Security Council has condemned the massacres of ethnic
Albanians in the Serbian province. NATO has threatened attacks on
Serb positions unless President Slobodan Milosevic withdraws his
troops.
	   ``It is terrible and I believe definitely that very serious
positive action is needed,'' Mary Robinson, U.N. High Commissioner
for Human Rights, said at a news conference in Oslo.
	   Robinson said she would not second-guess the decision of the
U.N. security council, which has yet to order military
intervention.
	   ``But I do find it unacceptable that we talk about human rights
... and then watch this level of violence unfold,'' Robinson said.
	   The Serb crackdown on the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army has
left hundreds dead and more than 270,000 homeless since it began in
February. Serbia is the dominant republic in the Yugoslav
federation.
	   After massacres last weekend, at least 18 civilians were killed
at a single site in the Drenica region.
	   Robinson was in Oslo to open a human rights symposium called by
Norway, her own office and the U.N. Human Development program.
	   In her keynote address, Robinson said human rights abuses are
still widespread, 50 years after the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
	   ``The international community has not been able to stop the
genocide in Cambodia or Rwanda, the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia (or)
the tragic situation in Kosovo,'' she said.
	   At a news conference afterwards, Robinson said her office was
trying to set up a small office in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo.
	   Robinson issued a rare condemnation Thursday to protest the
murder of men, women and children in Kosovo.
	   ``These killings are particularly reprehensible because they are
evidence that, despite expressions of international concern and
official (Yugoslav) assurances that civilians would be respected,
atrocities are continuing in Kosovo,'' her statement said.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks opened little changed on Wall Street on
Friday as traders looked for bargains in the aftermath of a global
selloff that knocked nearly 6 percent off the Dow industrials over
the previous three days.
	   European stocks were falling sharply, however, and Asian markets
turned in a mixed performance.
	   The Dow Jones industrials, down 476.31 over the past three
sessions, was up 4.12 at 7,636.65 in the early going Friday.
Broader indicators were mixed.
	   There was an additional sign that money is not pouring out of
stocks. The market for U.S. government bonds, which has been
rallying on a ``flight-to-safety'' this week, stabilized in the
morning. Interest rates on Treasury bonds, which move in the
opposite direction from bond prices, edged higher Friday after
falling to 30-year lows in each of the past three days.
	   The Dow's slide included back-to-back losses of more than 200
points on Wednesday and Thursday. Traders remain worried about a
global economic slowdown that is cutting the profits of U.S.
companies and fears of further fallout from the near-collapse last
week of Long-Term Capital Management LP, a Greenwich, Connecticut,
hedge fund.
	   There was fresh evidence of a cooling of the U.S. economy Friday
as the government reported a small rise in the unemployment rate
and a slowdown in the growth of new jobs.
	   The unemployment rate was 4.6 percent in September, compared
with 4.5 percent during the three previous months and a 28-year low
of 4.3 percent in April and May. In addition, the government said
employers added only 69,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, the
weakest figure since a blizzard in the Northeast forced businesses
to cut payrolls in January 1996.
	   European markets were beset by worries about recession and
further fallout from the dlrs 3.6 billion rescue of the hedge fund.
On Friday, the chairman resigned at the Swiss bank UBS AG, which
has said it will lose dlrs 1.6 billion as a result of its
involvement with Long-Term Capital Management.
	   In afternoon trading, the key stock index in London was down 2.4
percent, and indicators were off 4.7 percent in Frankfurt, Germany,
and 2.1 percent in Paris.
	   ``We're entering a very grave global situation. A global
recession seems very likely,'' Lionel Sens, a salesman at Credit
Lyonnais Securities in Paris, said. ``Things aren't going to
improve anytime soon.''
	   Stocks finished mixed in Japan with the market's main indicator
posting a slim 0.2 percent gain.
	   There was an encouraging development in Japan after markets
closed as the lower house of parliament passed a package of bills
that would allow the government to use taxpayer money to help clean
up banks' massive bad loan problems. The move is widely viewed as a
crucial first step to economic recovery.
	   The key index in South Korea also edged higher. Key market
gauges fell, however, in Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan and the
Philippines.
	   Hong Kong and Shanghai financial markets were closed today to
celebrate China's National Day holiday.

	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australia survived a second-half
comeback from Tahiti to beat the South Pacific island team 4-1 in
an Oceania Nations Cup semifinal Friday at Suncorp Stadium.
	   New Zealand earlier beat Fiji 1-0 on Danny Hay's 88th-minute
goal to advance to Sunday's final against Australia.
	   Tahiti's fate looked to be sealed at half-time after the
Socceroos raced to a commanding 2-0 lead following two goals by
striker Damian Mori.
	   Tahiti has lost all six previous encounters against the
Socceroos.
	   New Zealand defender Danny Hay sunk the Fijians with a glancing
header two minutes from time off a delicate cross from midfielder
Aaran Lines on the left flank. (djp)

Man accused of wearing a Hitler tattoo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Police pressed charges against a
31-year old man for violating the country's law prohibiting
promotion of fascism by wearing a Hitler tattoo in public, media
reported Friday.
	   ``The investigator accused him of wearing a tattoo of the
fascist leader, and thus publicly expressing his sympathy with this
movement,'' police spokesman Petr Kovar told CTK news agency.
	   According to the report, the man's tattoo depicted German
fascist leader Adolf Hitler in uniform wearing a swastika armband.
	   Kovar said the man wore the tattoo publicly and will have to
either change or erase it.
	   Illegal promotion of movements aimed at suppressing human
rights, such as fascism and communism, is punishable in the Czech
Republic with one to five years in prison.

Washington tries to negotiate understanding on unilateral steps
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The United States is trying to coax a
pledge from Israel not to expand Jewish settlements, in exchange
for assurances from the Palestinians that they will not encourage
illegal construction, a Palestinian negotiator said Friday.
	   The United States has intensified negotiations with Israel's
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to conclude a long-overdue agreement on an Israeli troop
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton has offered each side a letter
guaranteeing that the other will refrain from certain unilateral
steps, said the negotiator, Saeb Erekat.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians have accepted the proposed trade,
but that ``I don't know this morning where Mr. Netanyahu stands on
these issues.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will arrive Tuesday
in the Middle East to try to narrow the gaps before an Oct. 15-19
Mideast summit in Washington, Erekat said.
	   During her two-day stay, Albright will meet Netanyahu and
Arafat. The U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, will accompany her and
stay on until Oct. 12.
	   Earlier this week, Clinton hosted Netanyahu and Arafat in a
three-way summit and also held separate talks with them.
	   Erekat said U.S. officials proposed a trade under which each
side would refrain from a number of unilateral steps.
	   ``We will be asked in an American-Palestinian understanding, for
instance, not to question Israel's credentials at the United
Nations,'' Erekat told a Palestinian-European conference in
Ramallah.
	   The Americans also proposed that the Palestinian Authority
coordinate with Israel on the granting of construction permits in
West Bank areas still under Israeli control, the negotiator said.
	   In exchange, Israel would agree not to expand Jewish settlements
and not to demolish some 1,800 Palestinian homes built without
permits.
	   An Israeli official said he was not familiar with the U.S.
proposal, but said it was highly unlikely Israel would agree to
such a trade. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.

Report: Israel fears attacks on holy sites during millennium
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Fearing attacks during the millennium, Israel
has conducted anti-terror drills at Jerusalem holy sites and
considers asking the United States and Europe for help in spotting
fanatics among Christian pilgrims, a newspaper said Friday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed that the
government's anti-terrorism adviser, Meir Dagan, has proposed
security measures to deal with millions of Christian pilgrims
expected in the Holy Land between 1999 and 2001.
	   Netanyahu spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said Dagan drew on
information provided by the Shin Bet security service and police
intelligence, but would not discuss the proposals made.
	   Israel expects that millions of Christian pilgrims will visit
the Holy Land in the next four years to mark the 2000th anniversary
of Jesus' birth. Some experts believe that among the visitors will
be thousands who believe the end of the world and the second coming
of Christ are near.
	   Kol Ha'ir, the Israeli weekly, said Netanyahu's anti-terror
adviser considered several scenarios, including that Christian
extremists attack Jerusalem holy sites to trigger an apocalyptic
bloodbath that would pave the way for redemption.
	   The weekly said special police units have carried out
anti-terrorist drills at holy places and that a police committee
has been set up to identify extremists among the pilgrims.
	   Security will be stepped up at Christian, Jewish and Muslim holy
places and state-of-the-art protective devices are to be installed,
the newspaper said.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin referred all questions to
Dagan's office.
	   The plan also calls for tougher security checks at airports.
Pilgrims will be required to show a return ticket and a reservation
at a hotel or other accommodation in Israel, the paper said.
	   Dagan also proposes that Israel enlist the help of the United
States and European governments in pinpointing extremists, Kol
Ha'ir said.

Seibu sweeps doubleheader with Nippon Ham
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Domingo Martinez hit a two-run homer in the first
game Friday as the Seibu Lions widened their Pacific League lead by
sweeping a doubleheader against the second-place Nippon Ham
Fighters, 6-3 and 3-1.
	   Leading by three games, the Lions now can clinch the league
pennant by winning five of their remaining 11 games.
	   Playing at Seibu Dome, the Lions' Taisei Takagi provided an
early lead with a two-run homer in the first inning off Nippon Ham
starter Kip Gross. Gross lasted only 1 1/3 innings and took the
loss, his third against three victories. Takagi has 16 homers this
season.
	   Seibu designated hitter Martinez, formerly of the Triple-A
Rochester team, added two more runs in the fifth inning with his
28th homer.
	   Nippon Ham's Nigel Wilson, formerly of the Cleveland Indians,
hit his league-leading 33rd homer of the year for the Fighters.
	   In the nightcap, Seibu pitcher Takashi Ishii gave up five hits
over 8 2/3 innings, picking up his ninth victory against three
losses.
	   Seibu's Kazuo Matsui hit a solo homer in the third inning and
Koji Otsuka contributed an inside-the-park homer in the seventh.
	   In the Central League, Bobby Rose, formerly of the California
Angels, drove in the winning run with a single in the eighth
inning, lifting the front-running Yokohama Baystars past the
second-place Chunichi Dragons 5-2 at Nagoya Dome.
	   The victory gave the BayStars a seven-game lead. Yokohama needs
to win just three games of its remaining 10 to clinch its first
pennant since 1960.
	   Yokohama hurler Kazuhiro Sasaki picked up his 43rd save and tied
former Chunichi reliever Kuo Yuan-tzu's record for ``save points''
_ saves plus wins in relief _ with 44.
	   In Hiroshima, Kojiro Machida hit a one-run homer in the second
inning and Alejandro Quezada, from the Carp's Dominican Academy,
belted a two-run shot in the sixth, lifting the Hiroshima Toyo Carp
over the Yomiuri Giants 6-3.

Unbeatens? How about the Saints?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ There's this unbeaten team in Sunday's U.S.
National Football League matchup between New England and New
Orleans, and it's not the Patriots.
	   ``Big deal'', is just about everyone's sarcastic comment.
	   That includes New Orleans coach Mike Ditka, who realizes his
club's 3-0 start was built at the hands of weaklings St. Louis
(1-3), Carolina (0-3) and Indianapolis (0-4).
	   ``If it had been Denver or Green Bay we beat, somebody would
have said it was a fluke,'' Ditka said. ``Not that we can beat
them, that it was a fluke.''
	   But New Orleans has gone 7-3 over the last 10 games and has
shown improvement offensively this year. The defense already was
impressive and has a sack in 52 straight games.
	   ``We've been playing the way we expect to play every game,''
defensive lineman Wayne Martin said. ``We just have to do that
again Sunday. It won't be easy against this team, but we can do
it.''
	   New Orleans is not making the critical mistakes that cost games.
It also seems to have discovered a running game. Running back Lamar
Smith had a career-high 157 yards on 24 carries in an overtime
victory at Indianapolis last weekend.
	   Last season, New Orleans opened 0-3 and coughed up the ball 19
times. This year, the Saints are plus-6 in turnover ratio.
	   ``Minus-19 in three games last year to plus-6 this year. That's
a turnaround of 25,'' Ditka said. ``That's unheard of, but it's
something our coaching staff has harped on.''
	   It's also something the Patriots excel at. They haven't had a
giveaway in their three games, the only team in the league that's
spotless.
	   ``It's something that we take great pride in and it's something
that we put a lot of emphasis on,'' said Patriots quarterback Drew
Bledsoe, who was last intercepted Dec. 12, 1997. ``The most
important statistic in football, other than the final score, is the
turnovers. If we can continue to take care of the football and not
turn it over, we give ourselves a great chance to win every game.''
	   In other games involving unbeaten teams Sunday, Miami (3-0) is
at the New York Jets; Philadelphia is at Denver (4-0); and San
Francisco (3-0) is at Buffalo. On Monday night, Minnesota goes to
Green Bay in a matchup of 4-0 teams.
	   Also Sunday, it's Carolina at Atlanta, Dallas at Washington,
Detroit at Chicago, San Diego at Indianapolis, Oakland at Arizona,
the New York Giants at Tampa Bay and Seattle at Kansas City.
	   Idle this week are Baltimore, Cincinnati, Jacksonville,
Pittsburgh and St. Louis.
	   The Dolphins have used a stingy defense that has allowed a
league-low 22 points, has 13 sacks and is a plus-6 in turnover
differential. Their running game also has perked up, and they don't
need to rely on Dan Marino so much.
	   Not that the Jets (1-2) are looking for Marino to be
inconsequential. They know better: In 26 career starts vs. New
York, he is 17-9, hitting on 565 of 945 passes for 7,699 yards and
67 touchdowns, with 28 interceptions.
	   ``It's a great test and a great incentive to play against him,''
Jets safety Victor Green said. ``If you get a pick or make a big
play on him, when he's in the Hall of Fame, you can say, `I did
this against him.'
	   ``They are playing sound football and running the ball, limiting
the chances for interceptions (none so far). They've taken the
pressure off Dan, so he doesn't have to throw for 300 yards.''
	   The Broncos have been overwhelming, as have the 49ers. Both face
winless teams that can't seem to do anything right.
	   Philadelphia (0-4) wouldn't seem to have much chance at Mile
High Stadium, where the hosts are 24-2 under coach Mike Shanahan,
the best mark at home by any NFL coach.
	   ``I turned on the Dallas film briefly for about five minutes,''
Eagles coach Ray Rhodes said. ``After I saw all those possessions
with touchdowns, I thought to myself: I'm not ready to look at this
yet. That's something a coach at 0-4 doesn't want to take a look at
right now. Let's go to another game.''

Man found guilty of trying to blackmail al Fayed's father
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A man who tried to sell the father of
Princess Diana's companion phony information about an alleged
murder plot against her and Dodi al Fayed was found guilty on
Friday of attempted fraud and sentenced to 2{ years in prison.
	   Oswald LeWinter was found innocent on another charge _ issuing a
dangerous threat.
	   The Austria Press Agency identified LeWinter as a former CIA
agent who claims double American-Israeli citizenship. He had
entered a guilty plea to the charges of trying to sell Mohamed al
Fayed phony documents for dlrs 15 million, said the agency.
	   The dangerous threat charge arose after he was alleged to have
threatened to kill an al Fayed bodyguard after his arrest in May.
	   LeWinter, 67, claimed to have come into the possession of phony
CIA documents presenting the car crash-deaths of Diana and Dodi al
Fayed in a Paris tunnel nearly 14 months ago as a murder carried
out by the British Secret Service and offered them to Mohamed al
Fayed.
	   Al Fayed, present in court Friday, was quoted as demanding that
LeWinter be severely punished.

Government, parliament consider ways to fight economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin would view any effort to
prohibit Russians from buying foreign currencies as a ``return of
the Iron Curtain'' and would have a ``very tough'' response, his
spokesman said Friday.
	   Government officials have denied any plans to limit the
circulation of U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies, but
Russian media have widely reported that is part of the plan to
stabilize the ruble and solve the country's economic crisis.
	   ``The president clearly understands that such a ban would be a
clear violation of our rights and, apart from the economic
consequences, that would mean a return of the Iron Curtain in
everyday life,'' said Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   ``The president's reaction to such a return would be very
tough,'' he said.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko also dismissed any
proposal to ban the circulation of foreign currency as a ``mad
idea.'' He and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov headed to
Washington for talks with the International Monetary Fund.
	   Before leaving, Zadornov met with leaders of the lower house of
parliament, the State Duma, to discuss how the government planned
to pay its debts to state-funded institutions.
	   Nikolai Kharitonov, head of the Agrarian Party faction, said the
government's crisis program ``is most likely to be composed after
we check our watches with the IMF, that is, when it becomes clear
what we can count on _ only on ourselves or on some outside
support,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Thursday that he might be
forced to take ``unpopular measures'' to salvage the Russian
economy if the IMF didn't come through with more money.
	   Russia has been trying to pressure the lending agency into
releasing the second, dlrs 4.3 billion installment of a loan that
was approved in July, a month before the country's economy crashed
and the government effectively defaulted on its foreign loans.
	   The IMF credit would allow Russia to come out of the crisis
``with minimum losses,'' Primakov said. Without the loan, he added,
``We will take measures _ measures that may be quite unpopular. We
will not throw our country to the winds.''
	   The business daily Kommersant said that the Cabinet has drafted
a budget for the fourth quarter of 1998 with a deficit nearing 100
billion rubles (around dlrs 6 billion), which is to be financed
almost entirely by the IMF loan.
	   ``The government's short-term program will depend on whether we
get dlrs 4.3 billion following the talks in America (with the
IMF),'' First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov said at a news
conference on Friday.
	   IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to come
up with a sound economic program before the loan is given, and have
made it clear that currency controls and boosting the money supply
by printing rubles are not acceptable.
	   The government was reportedly considering an economic plan
loaded with just such measures. The blueprint was prepared by Yuri
Maslyukov, a Communist who is first deputy prime minister in charge
of economic strategy. Maslyukov served as the last chairman of the
Soviet central planning agency.
	   Liberal politicians and the media have criticized the plan as an
effective reversal of free-market reforms and return to the
Soviet-style command economy.
	   ``It's a program of combating the ruble's convertibility and
closing the Russian economy,'' former prime minister Yegor Gaidar,
who initiated Russia's free-market reforms in 1992, said on Friday,
according to Interfax.
	   Primakov insisted, however, that the plan published in
Kommersant is just one of six alternatives his Cabinet is
considering.
	   A government session on Thursday considered Maslyukov's plan but
refused to accept it after Zadornov's sharp criticism, Kommersant
said Friday.

Taliban ambassador says Iran jets violate Afghan air space
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious army
said Iranian fighter jets violated Afghan airspace Friday, and it
warned of ``disastrous effects'' if the violations continued.
	   The allegations by the Taliban's ambassador to Pakistan, Maulvi
Saeed-ur-Rehman Haqqani, could not be independently confirmed.
There was no immediate comment from Iran.
	   Early Friday, 15 Iranian fighter jets entered Afghan airspace
over western Nimroz province and flew over neighboring Herat
province before returning to Iran, Haqqani said.
	   About the same time, 15 helicopters also violated Afghan
airspace, the Taliban ambassador said in a statement issued to the
privately run Pakistani news agency, News Network International
(NNI).
	   Several weeks ago, Iran deployed more than 200,000 soldiers, as
well as helicopter gun ships and jet fighters, to its eastern
borders with Afghanistan. The deployment came after Taliban
fighters killed eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist
during the Aug. 8 capture of the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   The Taliban leadership blamed renegade soldiers for the killings
but has refused to apologize to Tehran. Instead the Taliban says
Iran is arming and financing its northern-based opposition, which
also includes the country's minority Shiite Muslims. Most Iranians
also are Shiite Muslims.
	   The Taliban army, believed to be supported by neighboring
Pakistan, is made up largely of ethnic Pashtuns, who are mostly
Sunni Muslims.
	   In areas under Taliban control, women are confined to the home,
girls are denied education, and television, movies and books have
been banned. Thieves have their hands cut off and murderers are
publicly executed.
	   In a statement issued to NNI, Haqqani urged the United Nations
to quickly intercede and put an end to the incursions.
	   While saying Afghanistan would not initiate a war with Iran,
Haqqani said the Taliban army would not back down from a fight. The
United Nations already has urged both countries to show restraint
and is sending its special envoy to the region.
	   It is believed the Taliban army has deployed an estimated 10,000
soldiers to its borders with Iran. Earlier this week another 4,000
fresh troops were reportedly sent to the border region.

Dissatisfied drunk goes amok in state liquor store
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ After drinking half of a bottle of hard
liquor, a Norwegian decided he wasn't getting enough of a buzz and
went on a rampage after a state liquor store refused to trade the
remaining spirits for something stronger.
	   When clerks at a Vinmonopolet _ the state liquor monopoly _ in
Oslo rejected his request, the 37-year-old man called the police to
demand their assistance in exchanging his booze, the Oslo newspaper
Verdens Gang reported Friday.
	   Police declined. But then the man, whose name was not released,
jumped over the counter on Thursday afternoon and started smashing
dozens bottles of liquor, getting the police to turn up anyway.
	   ``The customer wanted to exchange a half-empty bottle of spirits
because he wasn't satisfied with the effect of its contents,''
liquor monopoly managing director Knut Groeholt was quoted as
telling the newspaper.
	   The Norwegian was arrested on charges of destruction of
property, public drunkenness and assaulting police officers. No was
injured in the incident.
	   Liquor prices in Norway are among the world's highest due to
heavy taxes to discourage drinking.

Congolese rebels take fight to the Internet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: in 3d graf, CHANGES name of rebel movement to Congolese
Democratic Coalition to conform to style

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels have taken their two-month
campaign to oust President Laurent Kabila to the Internet.
	   ``We have to explain to the world audience who we are and what
we're fighting for,'' rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said on
Friday. ``Besides, the (Kabila) government has been using the
Internet to tell their side of the story.''
	   The 56-year-old history professor at the University of Dar es
Salaam in Tanzania said supporters of the Congolese Democratic
Coalition in the United States have created a web site for the
rebellion.
	   The site _ www.prairienet.org/panafrican/cdm _ has been set up
on the donor-supported Prairenet Community Network in eastern
Illinois.
	   The rebels are a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted
members of Kabila's army and political opponents who accuse Kabila
of power-grabbing, mismanagement, corruption and sowing dissent
among Congo's 400 tribes.
	   After an initial lightning advance in the far west of Africa's
third-largest nation, the rebels were stopped at the outskirts of
the capital, Kinshasa, by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia,
who are backing Kabila.
	   Since then, the rebels have been confined to a chunk of
territory in the extreme eastern part of the country where their
rebellion was declared Aug. 2.
	   Wamba said the rebels control 40 percent of Congo, an area of 15
million people.
	   So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels,
accusing them of being the puppets of neighboring Rwanda and
Uganda.
	   Posting the rebel mission statement on the Internet is just part
of the media campaign.
	   Last week, Wamba dispatched two of his top aides to the United
States and Europe to lobby for political support and raise public
awareness about the conflict in Congo.
	   ``World leaders, diplomats and are not familiar enough with our
cause. They still talk about Tutsis leading the rebellion. Well,
I'm not a Tutsi,'' Wamba said.
	   Jacques Depelchin, the movement's vice president and a former
lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley, met in
Washington earlier this week with the U.S. special envoy in the
Great Lakes region of Central Africa, Howard Wolpe and with
congressmen, Wamba said.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The top U.N. human rights official on Friday
condemned violence against civilians in Kosovo and urged urgent
action to stop the slaughter in the majority ethnic Albanian
province.
	   The U.N. Security Council has condemned the massacres of ethnic
Albanians in the Serbian province. NATO has threatened attacks on
Serb positions unless President Slobodan Milosevic withdraws his
troops.
	   ``It is terrible and I believe definitely that very serious
positive action is needed,'' Mary Robinson, U.N. High Commissioner
for Human Rights, said at a news conference in Oslo.
	   Robinson said she would not second-guess the decision of the
U.N. security council, which has yet to order military
intervention.
	   ``But I do find it unacceptable that we talk about human rights
... and then watch this level of violence unfold,'' Robinson said.
	   The Serb crackdown on the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army has
left hundreds dead and more than 270,000 homeless since it began in
February. Serbia is the dominant republic in the Yugoslav
federation.
	   After massacres last weekend, at least 18 civilians were killed
at a single site in the Drenica region.
	   Robinson was in Oslo to open a human rights symposium called by
Norway, her own office and the U.N. Human Development program.
	   In her keynote address, Robinson said human rights abuses are
still widespread, 50 years after the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
	   ``The international community has not been able to stop the
genocide in Cambodia or Rwanda, the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia (or)
the tragic situation in Kosovo,'' she said.
	   At a news conference afterwards, Robinson said her office was
trying to set up a small office in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo.
	   Robinson issued a rare condemnation Thursday to protest the
murder of men, women and children in Kosovo.
	   ``These killings are particularly reprehensible because they are
evidence that, despite expressions of international concern and
official (Yugoslav) assurances that civilians would be respected,
atrocities are continuing in Kosovo,'' her statement said.

Spain protests Gibraltar police action against fishermen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain and Britain swapped formal protests
Friday concerning disputes over fishing and road access to the
disputed colony of Gibraltar.
	   Spanish officials claim Gibraltar coastal guards boarded several
Spanish fishing boats overnight, causing damage to one.
	   Gibraltar claims Spanish fishermen have no right to fish in a
three-mile (five-kilometer) area around the British-ruled Rock
situated on Spain's southern tip and lately have been urging them
to leave the area.
	   The fishermen deny that the waters belong to Gibraltar and claim
they have always fished in the zone.
	   British authorities admitted that in the past the fishermen have
been allowed work the waters, but argue the numbers fishing have
grown greatly in recent months.
	   British embassy spokesman Patrick Owen said Britain rejected the
Spanish complaint and had lodged one of its own to protest what it
deems to be unnecessary delays being caused by Spanish police at
the border crossing between Spain and Gibraltar.
	   The fishing issue has been under discussion between Spanish and
Gibraltar officials in recent weeks but has yet to be resolved.
	   Last weekend, dozens of fishermen blocked the road leading onto
the Rock in protest at Gibraltar coast guard actions.
	   Gibraltar, located at the entrance to the Mediterranean, has
bedeviled relations between Spain and Britain since the land was
ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.
	   The conservative government of Jose Maria Aznar in Madrid has
been vigorously pressing Spain's claim to sovereignty over
Gibraltar. However, the 55,000 Gibraltarians overwhelmingly oppose
becoming a part of Spain, and Britain argues that it cannot hand
over sovereignty without the consent of the colony's residents.

Three kids seriously injured as bus loses its top
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRANTHAM, England (AP) _ Three children were seriously injured
Friday when a low bridge sheared off the top of a double-decker
bus.
	   Thirty-five other children were treated for cuts and bruises,
police said. The bus was carrying 63 youngsters aged 5 to 10 to a
swimming lesson in Grantham, 105 miles (170 kms) north of London.
	   ``Had the top deck been full of adults I am sure that several
would have been killed. These children have had a very lucky
escape,'' said Chief Inspector Mark Marsden.
	   Police said they would question the driver about why he tried to
go under the railway bridge, which had a clearance of 13 feet (4
meters).

 &UR; Eds: TOPs with 9 grafs to UPDATE Dow retreating, adding volume,

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street was extending its slide Friday after
an attempt fizzled to bounce back from a global selloff that
knocked nearly 6 percent off the Dow industrials over the previous
three days.
	   European stocks were falling sharply and Asian markets turned in
a mixed performance.
	   The Dow Jones industrials, down 476.31 over the past three
sessions, was up as much as 56.64 in the early going as
bargain-hunters emerged. But the Dow quickly retreated and was off
95.78 at 7,536.75 at midmorning. Broader indicators also were
falling in active trading that was running below Thursday's heavy
pace.
	   More money also flowed into U.S. government bonds, a traditional
haven for cash in times of uncertainty. Interest rates on Treasury
bonds, which move in the opposite direction from bond prices, were
falling further Friday after dropping to 30-year lows in each of
the past three days.
	   The Dow's slide included back-to-back losses of more than 200
points on Wednesday and Thursday. Traders remain worried about a
global economic slowdown that is cutting the profits of U.S.
companies and fears of further fallout from the near-collapse last
week of Long-Term Capital Management LP hedge fund.
	   There was fresh evidence of a cooling of the U.S. economy Friday
as the government reported a small rise in the unemployment rate
and a slowdown in the growth of new jobs.
	   The unemployment rate was 4.6 percent in September, compared
with 4.5 percent during the three previous months and a 28-year low
of 4.3 percent in April and May. In addition, the government said
employers added only 69,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, the
weakest figure since a blizzard in the Northeast forced businesses
to cut payrolls in January 1996.
	   European markets were beset by worries about recession and
further fallout from the dlrs 3.6 billion rescue of the hedge fund.
On Friday, the chairman resigned at the Swiss bank UBS AG, which
has said it will lose dlrs 1.6 billion as a result of its
involvement with Long-Term Capital Management.
	   In afternoon trading, the key stock index in London was down 2.6
percent, and indicators were off 6.3 percent in Frankfurt, Germany,
4.3 percent in Zurich, Switzerland, and 3.2 percent in Paris.

Ex-employee hijacks corporate plane

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police saying hijacker upset over being turned
down for liquor license, other details; TRIMS

<TEXT>
	   MARIGNANE, France (AP) _ A former aerospace employee hijacked a
company plane with 15 people aboard Friday, forcing the pilot to
land at an airport outside Marseille, officials said.
	   The plane, identified as a Falcon 20 belonging to Serge Dassault
Aviation, landed at Marseille-Marignane Airport at 12:30 p.m. (1030
GMT) after being hijacked while on a flight from Paris, Marseille
police said.
	   The former Dassault employee, armed with a shotgun and grenades,
first demanded to talk to his lawyer, the police said on customary
anonymity.
	   Police said the hijacker, identified by French radio as a
53-year-old man who left jetmaker six years ago, was upset over
being rejected a liquor license for his bar.
	   He then released 10 hostages unharmed but continued to hold the
pilot and an undetermined number of other people. He freed the rest
of his hostages and surrendered about two 1/2 hours after the plane
landed, police said.
	   The plane ferries employees between the corporate headquarters
near Paris and the company's plant in the southern city of Istres.
	   Dassault builds fighter planes including the Mirage and Rafale,
as well as civilian planes including the Falcon.

Spanish town eyes aircraft carrier just for fun
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARBELLA, Spain (AP) _ In a seaside resort of big money and big
stars, what better than an aircraft carrier for a playground?
	   Mayor Jesus Gil says he wants to buy one from Argentina, tow it
to waters off Marbella and turn it into a honeycomb of nightclubs,
art galleries and other treats, maybe even a casino.
	   ``People may think it's a joke,'' he told reporters Thursday.
``I don't care.''
	   Gil, who also owns one of Spain's top soccer teams, Atletico de
Madrid, said Marbella is in negotiations with Argentina on buying a
now-disused aircraft carrier that was deployed in the 1982 war with
Britain over the Falkland Islands.
	   The price tag for the ship is 130 million pesetas (dlrs
930,000).
	   City officials say they have yet to figure out how much it will
cost to have tug boats bring it to Spain's southern Costa del Sol,
re-dredge Marbella's harbor and overhaul the behemoth for
entertainment purposes.
	   They are not even sure if they can get permission from Andalusia
regional authorities.
	   But officials here say an aircraft carrier is a good idea for
this Mediterranean town, which is a mecca for Spanish celebrities
and jet-setters from around the world.
	   By day, they say, children could be taken on guided tours of the
ship and its exhibition rooms. The rest of the time it would
concentrate lots of noisy nightlife in one sprawling space _ 10,000
square meters (108,000 square feet) of it.
	   ``The idea is to use it for recreation and leisure activities,''
one city official said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia's Serb leadership on
Friday invited U.N. chief Kofi Annan to visit, saying it would help
him understand ``the real situation in Kosovo'' after international
condemnation of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians and the
threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   The invitation, carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency,
came after an ethnic Albanian man gave human rights workers a
graphic account of what he said was a massacre of 13 ethnic
Albanian men by Serbian police in a Kosovo forest on Saturday.
	   The Serb invitation also came days before Annan is scheduled to
submit a report on compliance with a U.N. Security Council
resolution demanding an end to the Kosovo offensive by Serbian
police and the Yugoslav army. The resolution threatens unspecified
further action if the demand is ignored.
	   Serb police have denied killing civilians, and Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said Thursday in Washington that his
government is willing to let an international team take part in an
investigation to ``establish and prove the facts.''
	   The Foreign Ministry in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade said
invitations had already gone out to forensic experts from Finland.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown in
February against rebels in Kosovo who are seeking independence for
the province in southern Serbia that is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   On Thursday, Peter Bouckaert of New York-based Human Rights
Watch said a wounded ethnic Albanian man, whose name was not
released to protect him, recounted how he survived the Saturday
massacre. The man's story was corroborated by other witnesses from
Golubovac, a village three miles (five kilometers) from Donje
Obrinje, the site of another massacre, Bouckaert said.
	   Relating the man's account, Bouckaert said Serb police sent old
men into nearby woods to tell refugees it was safe to come out of
their hiding place.
	   Police then selected about 20 to 25 of the men; the older ones
were eventually let go. The rest were forced to lie on their
stomachs with their hands behind their heads. All were beaten and
kicked and told if they would say who in the group belonged to the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, the rest could go free.
	   Finally, ``one policeman executed them all with short bursts of
automatic fire,'' Bouckaert said the survivor told him. After two
trips up and down the line, the policemen kicked each victim.
	   The man said he waited about 10 or 15 minutes, then fled home,
where his mother and wife waited, according to Bouckaert.
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council condemned ``those
responsible'' for the bloodletting in Kosovo, but Britain and the
United States failed to convince Russia and China to specifically
blame the Serbs. The council called on Milosevic to identify, find
and punish the killers.
	   Britain, among the most vocal supporters of NATO action as a
last resort, delivered strong warnings Friday.
	   ``This is a humanitarian disaster,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair
told Channel 4 TV News in London. ``I believe it will only be
stopped if Milosevic gets the clearest possible message ... namely,
if you carry on doing this, you will face a military penalty.''
	   But Russia's parliament declared Friday that any NATO military
action taken without U.N. approval would be considered an ``illegal
act of aggression.''
	   On Thursday, Serbian Deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj threatened
retaliation against NATO personnel outside Yugoslavia if the
alliance launched strikes against Yugoslav or Serbian targets to
stop the bloodshed in Kosovo. In Bosnia on Friday, spokesman Maj.
Richard Saint-Louis said NATO troops there will protect themselves
if attacked.
	   Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo support independence, although
many Western nations do not, fearing it could further destabilize
the Balkans.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department urged Americans in
Yugoslavia to consider leaving. Spokesman James Rubin said military
action is closer to a reality ``because of Belgrade's failure to
comply with the requirements of the international community.''

Report: 100 killed in Sudan tribal clashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ More than 100 people have died in clashes
among tribespeople in western Sudan, an independent newspaper
reported Friday.
	   The fighting started when members of the Abu Darak clan tried to
split from the Habania tribe and set up their own tribe, the Akhbar
al-Saa said.
	   The fighting in the province of South Dafur left at least 100
people hundred dead and ``a large number of persons displaced,''
said the paper. It did not say when the clashes occurred.
	   Akhbar al-Saa said the dispute goes back to 1997 when Abu Darak
clan attempted to assert its independence during a camel race.
	   It said the government plans to mediate between tribal elders
who are now in Khartoum.
	   Armed clashes among tribes in Dafur have been on the increase
since a 1985 drought made competition for grazing lands among
nomadic tribes more fierce.

Swissair flight forced to land at Vienna airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A Swissair flight from Bucharest to
Zurich made an unscheduled stop in Vienna on Friday after an
anonymous caller in Bucharest said a bomb was on board, officials
said.
	   The plane, an Airbus A320 carrying 68 people, flew on to
Switzerland nearly four hours later after no bomb was found, said
Mario Sante, a spokesman for Vienna International Airport.
	   Police removed all the baggage and mail and questioned the
passengers but learned nothing about a possible bomb, officials
said.
	   In Romania, the Transport Ministry said the call was received a
half-hour after Flight 461 left at 8:42 a.m. (0542 GMT).
	   The plane landed in Vienna at 8:31 a.m. (0631 GMT) and left at
12:17 p.m. (1017 GMT), Sante said.
	   In Zurich, Swissair spokesman Erwin Schaerer said it landed
safely at Kloten airport at 1:30 p.m. (1130 GMT).
	   The airline had no indication of a motive behind the bomb threat
or where it came from, Schaerer said.
	   Romania's central bank governor, Mugur Isarescu, was among the
32 Romanian passengers on board, on his way to Washington for a
meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, a
Bucharest radio station reported.

State Duma: NATO attack over Kosovo would be unprovoked aggression
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Primakov saying Kosovo can't be solved by force. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The problems in Kosovo cannot be solved by the use
of outside force, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Friday.
	   Primakov also reiterated the Russian position that any NATO
military action over Kosovo requires authorization from the United
Nations, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Primakov made his comments in a telephone conversation with
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Earlier Friday, Russia's parliament also declared that any NATO
military action over Kosovo taken without U.N. approval would be
considered an ``illegal act of aggression.''
	   In a resolution passed unanimously by a vote of 359 to 0, the
State Duma lower house of parliament said it would review all
agreements between NATO and Russia if the western alliance were to
opt for force against Yugoslavia.
	   Such a decision ``may cause irreparable harm to the
international security system fixed in the U.N. Charter,'' the
resolution said.
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution passed last week urges a
cease-fire and threatens to consider ``further action and
additional measures'' if the belligerents continue fighting in
Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia.
	   The NATO allies have not yet resolved their differences over
whether a further U.N. resolution is needed to launch airstrikes.
NATO authorities requested Thursday that the member countries come
forward with specific offers of weapons for possible airstrikes,
but a final decision about whether to use force won't likely be
made until next week.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov warned that ``if a single bomb or
rocket is dropped in Serbia, the Yugoslav army will retaliate ...
and this can trigger a full-scale war,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   The Duma said it would consider renewing military-technical
cooperation with Yugoslavia in the event of a NATO strike.
	   It called on both sides in the Kosovo conflict to cease fighting
and start peace talks, and appealed to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to fulfill the agreement he struck with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin in Moscow in June.
	   That agreement called for Yugoslav authorities to provide
security for the civilian population of Kosovo, create conditions
for the return of refugees and prosecute those responsible for
crimes against civilians.

Rebels: 10,000 Congolese Tutsis flee government persecution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHE NKURUNZIZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UVIRA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels say more than 10,000 ethnic
Tutsis have fled persecution by government forces in eastern Congo,
and 318 arrived this week in the Lake Tangyanika town of Uvira.
	   Rebel official Moise Nyarugago said Thursday that another 5,000
Congolese Tutsis who had fled from the southeastern Vyura region
around the town of Moba had reached rebel-controlled Kalemie on
Lake Tanganyika, halfway between Moba and their destination, Uvira,
on the lake's northwestern shore.
	   On Thursday, Nyarugago showed journalists the 318 displaced
people who had arrived in Uvira Tuesday. He said 10,000 ethnic
Tutsis known as Banyamulenge were on the move, fleeing government
forces he accused of carrying out genocide.
	   ``If a government can select one category of people to kill or
exterminate, I think this is what we call genocide,'' Nyarugago
said.
	   ``We think it is a very important humanitarian issue and ask the
international community to assist them. Neglecting 10,000 people in
danger would be a bad thing.''
	   Congolese rebels have taken control of several major eastern
towns since they began their uprising Aug. 2 to oust President
Laurent Kabila.
	   A few of the rebel leaders and some of the officers leading the
rebellion are Banyamulenge. Rebels have accused Kabila of targeting
Tutsis for extermination. Before it was taken over by rebels, the
radio in the then-government town of Bunia in northeastern Congo
encouraged local residents to hunt down and kill with whatever
weapons at hand all the Tutsis they could find.
	   Rebels also claim Kabila is recruiting and training former
Rwandan Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible for the 1994
genocide of half a million Tutsis in Rwanda.
	   The exiled Rwandan Hutus are now staging their own rebellion
from the Congo against the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan government.
	   Nyarugago said the Congolese rebels now controlled all of North
and South Kivu provinces in eastern Congo as well as part of
southeastern Katanga province where Moba is located. He said some
15 million people live in the rebel-controlled territory.
	   Kabila denies encouraging ethnic persecution and accuses the
Congolese rebels of being puppets of Rwanda and Uganda, whom he has
accused of invading Congo.
	   Both countries insist they are justified in protecting their
borders from rebel incursions but have not publicly acknowledged
that their troops are fighting with the Congolese rebels.

Striking archaeologists block ticket windows at the Louvre

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Visitors to the Louvre got in free Friday as state
archaeologists blocked ticket windows to protest a government
decision to end their monopoly on digging up France's heritage.
	   The decision, announced jointly this week by the French Culture
and Finance Ministries, means competition for the Association for
National Archaeological Excavations and its 2,000 members who have
handled the vast majority of digs in France.
	   About 150 archaeologists set up a picket line and distributed
pamphlets, blocking access to museum ticket windows. Museum
cashiers left their posts in support of the strikers, allowing
visitors to free entrance.
	   According to the decision, which is in keeping with European
Union guidelines, building contractors must open excavation
contracts to tender.
	   Critics fear private groups lack the professional expertise to
analyse and preserve the many relics that lie hidden beneath French
soil.
	   Others say private groups will cave in to commercial pressure
because serious digging sometimes requires years and often results
in costly delays for contractors.
	   ``Archaeology isn't merchandise, and the lowest price doesn't
necessarity correspond to the highest quality work,'' said Patrick
Barbier, spokesman for AFAN. ``The national heritage belongs to us
all.''
	   According to historian Alfred Fierro, author of the recent
``Dictionary of Lost Paris,'' more than 4,500 sites and historical
monuments have been razed as the city developed over the centuries.
	   Today, the trend is toward maximum preservation.
	   Archaeologists and citizens groups are furious over two-year
excavations near the Parc Montsouris in southern Paris which saw
the destruction of a 25-meter-long (75-foot-long) segment of an
aquaduct dating to the first and 17th centuries.
	   Defenders say other sections of the aquaduct will be displayed
behind glass in a specially-designed crypt located in the entrance
to a renovated metro station at Cite Universitaire.
	   Michel Fleury, president of the Old Paris Commission overseeing
the dig, justified razing the aquaduct saying ``all elements were
studied and photographed'' for posterity.

Tyson says he's bitter and potentially explosive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mike Tyson says he's bitter and defensive, and a
threat to explode.
	   The former heavyweight boxing champion, who is trying to win
back his license to fight in the state of Nevada, made the comments
in an interview in this month's Playboy magazine.
	   ``I know I'm going to blow one day,'' Tyson was quoted as saying
in the profanity-laced interview, which was conducted in July
before his appearance in front of the New Jersey Athletic
Commission.
	   He described himself as a ``hateful individual.''
	   ``My life is doomed the way it is, I have no future,'' Tyson
said. ``I feel bad about my outlook, how I feel about people and
society, and that I'll never be part of society the way I should.''
	   He saw only gloom ahead for him.
	   ``I expect the worst to happen in my life. I expect people to
... treat me bad,'' Tyson said, adding that he expects someday
someone to shoot him.
	   Tyson lost his license in Nevada for biting champion Evander
Holyfield's ears during their championship fight.
	   The revocation of his license effectively prohibits him from
boxing anywhere in the United States.
	   Of that incident, Tyson, who accused Holyfield of intentionally
butting him with his head during the bout, said he was enraged and
angry.
	   ``I wanted to kill him, bite him,'' he said.
	   Tyson appeared before the New Jersey panel to get permission to
fight in a bout in Atlantic City, but withdrew his request before
the the commission rendered a decision.
	   Last month he applied to the Nevada Athletic Commission to get
his license back. The commission ordered him to undergo
psychological testing before it would restore his license.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A man who tried to sell the father of
Princess Diana's companion phony information about an alleged
murder plot against her and Dodi Fayed was found guilty on Friday
of attempted fraud and sentenced to 2{ years in prison.
	   Oswald LeWinter was found innocent on another charge _ issuing a
dangerous threat.
	   The Austria Press Agency identified LeWinter as a former CIA
agent who claims double American-Israeli citizenship. He had
entered a guilty plea to the charges of trying to sell Mohamed al
Fayed phony documents for dlrs 15 million, said the agency.
	   The dangerous threat charge arose after he was alleged to have
threatened to kill an al Fayed bodyguard after his arrest in May.
	   LeWinter, 67, claimed to have come into the possession of phony
CIA documents presenting the car crash-deaths of Diana and Dodi al
Fayed in a Paris tunnel nearly 14 months ago as murder carried out
by the British Secret Service and offered them to Mohamed al Fayed.
	   Al Fayed, present in court Friday, was quoted as demanding that
LeWinter be severely punished.

German soldier charged in connection with neo-Nazi videos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ In a case that shocked Germany and
embarrassed its army, a former soldier has been charged connection
with neo-Nazi videotapes showing soldiers giving the Hitler salute
and talking about killing Jews, prosecutors announced Friday.
	   The former private first class, identified only as Michael R.,
helped cause the furor by turning the homemade videos over to a TV
news program.
	   Michael R., charged earlier this week, was among six soldiers
who acted out neo-Nazi scenes in the videos. He alone was charged,
with incitement of the public and public display of Nazi symbols,
because he made the videos public, state prosecutor Gerhard Greiner
said.
	   He faces up to five years imprisonment if convicted. No trial
date was set.
	   Prosecutors say the six soldiers, all of the 571st Mountain
Infantry battalion in the eastern town of Schneeberg, made five
videos during 1994-95. All soldiers were dismissed from the army.
	   Clips of the videos were broadcast last October on Sat1
television. The broadcast was followed by revelations that a known
neo-Nazi had given a speech at a military officers school in
Hamburg. The incidents combined sparked a parliamentary
investigation into extreme-rightist activity in the German army.
	   While the investigation found that neo-Nazi leanings were no
more widespread in the military than in daily life, Defense
Minister Volker Ruehe ordered the army to increase education
programs about tolerance and democracy.

Pope praises anti-abortion movement in United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II praised the anti-abortion
movement in the United States on Friday, calling it ``one of the
most positive aspects of American public life.''
	   The pontiff also denounced partial-birth abortions, which a
Republican-led bloc in the U.S. Senate tried unsuccessfully to ban
this year.
	   The pope, speaking to a group of American bishhops, noted a
``widespread mobilization of consciences in support of life'' in
the 25 years since the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide.
	   ``The pro-life movement is one of the most positive aspects of
American public life, and the support given it by the bishops is a
tribute to your pastoral leadership. Despite the generous efforts
of so many, however, the idea that elective abortion is a `right'
continues to be asserted.''
	   ``Moreover, there are signs of an almost unimaginable
insensitivity to the reality of what actually happens during an
abortion, as evidenced in recent events surrounding the so-called
`partial-birth' abortion,'' the pope said.
	   Partial-birth abortion entails feet-first delivery of a fetus
and drainage of its skull.
	   John Paul also urged Catholic families in the United States to
open their homes to unwanted children.
	   He called on everyone _ Catholic lawmakers in particular _ to
support the ``inalienable right'' to life from conception to
natural death _ for the unborn, for the handicapped, the elderly
and the terminally ill.
	   ``What is at stake here is nothing less than the indivisible
truth about the human person on which the Founding Fathers staked
your nation's claim to independence,'' John Paul said.
	   ``The life of a country is much more than its material
development and its power in the world,'' he said. ``A nation needs
a soul.''

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A man who tried to sell the father of
Princess Diana's companion phony information about an alleged
murder plot against her and Dodi Fayed was found guilty on Friday
of attempted fraud and sentenced to 2{ years in prison.
	   Oswald LeWinter was found innocent on another charge _ issuing a
dangerous threat.
	   The Austria Press Agency identified LeWinter as a former CIA
agent who claims double American-Israeli citizenship. He had
entered a guilty plea to the charges of trying to sell Mohamed al
Fayed phony documents for dlrs 15 million, said the agency.
	   The dangerous threat charge arose after he was alleged to have
threatened to kill an al Fayed bodyguard after his arrest in May.
	   LeWinter, 67, claimed to have come into the possession of phony
CIA documents presenting the car crash-deaths of Diana and Dodi
Fayed in a Paris tunnel nearly 14 months ago as murder carried out
by the British Secret Service and offered them to Mohamed al Fayed.
	   Al Fayed, present in court Friday, was quoted as demanding that
LeWinter be severely punished.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police have arrested five people on
charges of planning a pro-independence protest in Irian Jaya, an
Indonesian province on New Guinea Island.
	   The five were detained Wednesday night in Jayapura, the
provincial capital of Irian Jaya, about 2,300 miles (3,700
kilometers) east of Jakarta, the official Antara news agency
reported.
	   It quoted Brig. Gen. Hotman Siagian, chief of the local police,
as saying the five have been formally detained as suspects.
	   Among them were Don Flasi, secretary of the local development
planning agency, and priest Agustinus Ansanay.
	   Siagian said police also have summoned a number of people
including Martinus Werimon, chairman of the student senate of the
state-run Cendrawasih University, for interrogation.
	   Siagian did not rule out possible interrogation of Yoris
Raweyai, an Irianese member of the People's Consultative Assembly
who allegedly masterminded a plan to hold protests Thursday and
Friday.
	   Security personnel had tightly guarded some strategic places in
the provincial town since Wednesday, Antara said.
	   Indonesia took over the former Dutch colony that covers the
western portion of New Guinea Island in 1963 and named it Irian
Jaya.
	   A small rebel group, called OPM or Free Papua Movement, has been
fighting since then for independence.
	   An unidentified group hoisted an OPM flag Friday in Manokwari,
450 miles (720 kilometers) west of Jayapura, Antara said in another
report.
	   The ``morning star'' flag flew in front of a local government
office for two hours before officers tore it down, Antara said.
	   The military was looking for those responsible for the incident,
it added, quoting Maj. Gen. Amir Sembiring, the regional military
chief.
	   In July, a series of pro-independence protests flared up in the
remote province. At least two protesters and one policeman were
killed.

Rebels: 10,000 Congolese Tutsis flee government persecution

	   UVIRA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels say more than 10,000 ethnic
Tutsis have fled persecution by government forces in eastern Congo,
and 318 arrived this week in the Lake Tangyanika town of Uvira.
	   Rebel official Moise Nyarugabo said Thursday that another 5,000
Congolese Tutsis who had fled from the southeastern Vyura region
around the town of Moba had reached rebel-controlled Kalemie on
Lake Tanganyika, halfway between Moba and their destination, Uvira,
on the lake's northwestern shore.
	   On Thursday, Nyarugabo showed journalists the 318 displaced
people who had arrived in Uvira Tuesday. He said 10,000 ethnic
Tutsis known as Banyamulenge were on the move, fleeing government
forces he accused of carrying out genocide.
	   ``If a government can select one category of people to kill or
exterminate, I think this is what we call genocide,'' Nyarugabo
said.
	   ``We think it is a very important humanitarian issue and ask the
international community to assist them. Neglecting 10,000 people in
danger would be a bad thing.''
	   Congolese rebels have taken control of several major eastern
towns since they began their uprising Aug. 2 to oust President
Laurent Kabila.
	   A few of the rebel leaders and some of the officers leading the
rebellion are Banyamulenge. Rebels have accused Kabila of targeting
Tutsis for extermination. Before it was taken over by rebels, the
radio in the then-government town of Bunia in northeastern Congo
encouraged local residents to hunt down and kill with whatever
weapons at hand all the Tutsis they could find.
	   Rebels also claim Kabila is recruiting and training former
Rwandan Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible for the 1994
genocide of half a million Tutsis in Rwanda.
	   The exiled Rwandan Hutus are now staging their own rebellion
from the Congo against the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan government.
	   Nyarugabo said the Congolese rebels now controlled all of North
and South Kivu provinces in eastern Congo as well as part of
southeastern Katanga province where Moba is located. He said some
15 million people live in the rebel-controlled territory.
	   Kabila denies encouraging ethnic persecution and accuses the
Congolese rebels of being puppets of Rwanda and Uganda, whom he has
accused of invading Congo.
	   Both countries insist they are justified in protecting their
borders from rebel incursions but have not publicly acknowledged
that their troops are fighting with the Congolese rebels.

Peslier out for third straight win at Arc de Triomphe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French prodigy Olivier Peslier, riding Sagamix,
will vie to equal the record of legendary jockey Pat Eddery on
Sunday by winning a third successive Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.
	   Peslier, 26, who mounted Peintre Celebre and Helissio to victory
in the last two years, is among the favorites in what is expected
to be a close race over the 2,400-meter (1 1/2 mile) course in
Longchamps, west of Paris.
	   In his short career, Peslier has also won the English and French
derbies, and been French champion jockey for the last two years.
	   This season, he has recorded 117 wins and racked up winnings of
23 million francs (dlrs 4.1 million) in France.
	   A third straight Arc de Triomphe win would match Eddery's
winning streak at Europe's most prestigious horse race between 1985
and 1987.
	   ``Sagamix will not mind the cut in the ground and it has been
raining heavily again,'' said Peslier's agent Shippy Ellis. ``It
would be brilliant if Olivier could win the Arc again and there is
no doubt he is on a horse with a serious chance.''
	   Peslier won this season's English derby on High-Rise, but
decided against riding the four-year old Irish colt at Longchamps,
opting instead to mount Jean-Luc Lagardere's relatively
inexperienced Sagamix, winner of this season's Prix Niel.
	   High-Rise, one of two horses entered by Sheik Mohammed bin
Rashid Al Maktoum, crown prince of Dubai, will instead be ridden by
Mick Kinane.
	   Victory for High-Rise would propel the horse into the elite
company of Mill Reef (1971) and Lamm Tara (1995), which also won
the English Derby and Arc de Triomphe in the same season.
	   Texan jockey Cash Asmussen, on Dream Well, is also looking to
stop Peslier.
	   The experienced Asmussen _ winner at the Arc de Triomphe back in
1991 on Suave Dancer _ has maintained good form this season, raking
in more than 12 million francs (dlrs 2.2 million) in France, but
has again been overshadowed by the younger Peslier.
	   Dream Well has had two outstanding outings this season, winning
both the Irish and French derbies, but came a poor third at the
Prix Niel, 11 lengths behind Sagamix.
	   Dream Well's backers point out that the Niel, normally a good
form guide for the Arc de Triomphe, was run on very heavy ground.
	   By Friday's deadline for entries, 14 horses _ 13 colts and one
filly _ had been declared, the smallest field for an Arc de
Triomphe since 1991.
	   Athos Christodoulou-owned Posidonas, ridden by Eddery, is the
only one of last year's runners back this year.
	   British bookmaker Ladbrokes on Friday had four 9/2 joint
favorites _ Dream Well, High Rise, Sagamix and Sea Wave, which won
the English Oakes so impressively in June.
	   Croco Rouge, which came second in the Prix Niel, was at 5/1.
	   The four million franc (dlrs 714,000)-race rarely goes against
form: in the last seven years, the favorite has won five times and
been placed on the other two races.
	   In Fridays' draw, High Rise, Sagamix and Sea Wave were drawn in
the middle, in stalls six, seven and eight, with Dream Well on the
outside in stall 14.

Swissair flight forced to land at Vienna airport

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A Swissair flight from Bucharest to
Zurich made an unscheduled stop in Vienna on Friday after an
anonymous caller in Bucharest said a bomb was on board, officials
said.
	   The plane, an Airbus A320 carrying 68 people, flew on to
Switzerland nearly four hours later after no bomb was found, said
Mario Sante, a spokesman for Vienna International Airport.
	   Police removed all the baggage and mail from Flight 461 and
questioned the passengers but learned nothing about a possible
bomb, officials said.
	   The plane landed in Vienna at 8:31 a.m. (0631 GMT) and left at
12:17 p.m. (1017 GMT), arriving safely at Zurich's Kloten airport
at 1:30 p.m. (1130 GMT). Swissair spokesman Erwin Schaerer said in
Zurich that the airline had no idea of the motive behind the threat
or where it came from
	   In Bucharest, Col. Sorin Stoicescu, operation director at
Otopeni Airport, said ``a man with a young voice'' called the
airport half an hour into the flight and asked whether the Swissair
Zurich flight had taken off.
	   When told it had, the man said: ``Did you discover the bomb?
It's going to explode,'' and he laughed and hung up, Stoicescu
reported. The call was recorded, as all telephone calls to the
airport are.
	   Stoicescu said the plane was in Hungarian airspace when the call
came but it was decided to land in Vienna because Austria and
Switzerland have an air agreement.
	   Romania's central bank governor, Mugur Isarescu, was among the
32 Romanian passengers on board, on his way to Washington for a
meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
Romanian authorities said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Bills that would provide at least 10 trillion yen
(dlrs 74 billion) in taxpayer money to help Japan over a major
economic stumbling block _ its mass of bad loans _ passed
Parliament's lower house Friday.
	   With Japan under pressure to reverse its recession and help
Asian economic recovery, the bills are a major victory for Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi and ended weeks of dispute between the ruling
party and the opposition.
	   They are virtually guaranteed to pass the upper house next week
and become law.
	   But almost immediately, legislators began to quarrel over a
separate ruling party proposal to use government loans to
strengthen weakened banks that had not failed.
	   ``It looks pretty tough,'' said opposition lawmaker Hajime
Ishii. ``It's like we're playing soccer and they threw in a rugby
ball.''
	   The amount of bad loans crippling Japanese banks has been
estimated at up to dlrs 1 trillion.
	   With new loans hard to get, business has been suffering,
especially small and medium-size companies. Unemployment is at a
record high, bankruptcies are soaring and consumer spending is
falling.
	   Washington has repeatedly prodded Tokyo to use public money for
a bank bailout. And the ruling party was eager for some progress on
the bills ahead of a meeting of finance ministers in Washington
this weekend.
	   But it was clear carrying out the cleanup would be a drawn-out
struggle.
	   Under the new law, the government would set up an organization
similar to the U.S. Resolution Trust Corp. in the 1980s U.S.
savings and loan crisis to buy bad debt from banks.
	   ``We must first solve the worries about the financial system,
which is the artery of our economy,'' said ruling party lawmaker
Kazumi Mochinaga.
	   The law also would allow the nationalization of some banks, as
well as ``bridge banks,'' the initial ruling party plan that would
allow the government to take over weak banks until they can be
brought back to health, Japanese media reports said.
	   It was unclear what standards would be used to decide which
banks would fall under each method. But the pool of public money to
help will total more than 10 trillion yen (dlrs 74 billion).
	   Procrastination over the bank cleanup and additional economic
rescue measures has underlined problems in Japanese political
leadership.
	   For decades, ruling politicians have relied on elite bureaucrats
who shaped national policy and wrote the laws. Ruling party
lawmakers acknowledge they were kept in the dark by the Finance
Ministry about the magnitude of the bad loan problem.
	   Opposition lawmakers accuse the ruling party of having too many
collusive ties with the banking sector to take needed action.
	   Adding to the political quagmire is the weakening of the ruling
party due to widespread public disenchantment over the recession.
While the opposition is not powerful enough to take control, it has
enough leverage to drag out decisions almost indefinitely.
	   While legislators were fighting over the bills last weekend,
Japan Leasing Corp. filed for bankruptcy _ Japan's biggest
bankruptcy since World War II. Its parent company was the ailing
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, whose bailout was the key sticking
point in the political wrangling.
	   The ruling party has been anxious to save Long-Term Credit Bank,
one of the nation's biggest banks, as well as other banks. But the
opposition opposed the plan, instead pushing for a solution that
would force bank management to be more accountable.

Beatification of controversial Cardinal delights Croats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS new 10th graf, `The Vatican ...' to ADD that Vatican
has not responded to controversy, called Stepinac heroic. EDITS

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ When Pope John Paul II beatifies
Croatia's wartime cardinal this weekend, he will be honoring one of
the Balkans' most controversial figures _ a man denounced as a Nazi
collaborator but hailed by many Croats as a national martyr.
	   Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who will advance toward sainthood
with the ceremony Saturday, was tried by the Communists in 1946 and
sentenced to 16 years imprisonment for collaborating with the
pro-Nazi Croatian puppet state established by the Germans during
World War II.
	   Stepinac died in 1960. In 1991, when Croatia broke from
Communist Yugoslavia, the new nationalist government rehabiliated
Stepinac and hailed him as a national hero.
	   The differing views of his life illustrate the problems facing
this newly independent nation struggling to resolve its wartime
past and define its place in modern Europe.
	   For decades, Serbs and many Jews saw Stepinac as a symbol of the
fascist state that tried to exterminate them. His critics said he
blessed fascist Croat soldiers, maintained contacts with pro-Nazi
leader Ante Pavelic and carried out the regime's order to convert
Serbs, who are Orthodox Christians, to Roman Catholicism.
	   For Croats, Catholicism is one of the foundations of their
national identity. The Catholic faith separates Croats from the
Orthodox Serbs who dominated the former Yugoslavia.
	   Stepinac was portrayed as a martyr _ the victim of Communist
attempts to suppress the Roman Catholic Church and stifle the
national aspirations of the Croat people. Some Croatian media
speculate that Stepinac was poisoned in prison.
	   The editor of Croatian television's religious program section,
Tonci Trstenjak, said he hoped the beatification ``will clear the
slandered face of Croatia.''
	   But the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Nazi-hunting organization,
asked the Vatican to postpone the ceremony until independent
researchers review Stepinac's role.
	   The Vatican did not respond to the request and has not made an
official comment on the controversy. On Friday, its newspaper
L'Osservatore Romano called Stepinac a ``heroic cardinal.''
	   Meanwhile, another figure from Croatia's Nazi-era past _ Dinko
Sakic _ is in jail pending trial for war crimes committed while he
served as commander of the notorious concentration camp Jasenovac,
where thousands of Serbs, Jews and anti-fascist Croats died.
	   Sakic escaped to Argentina after the war and remained free until
June, when he was extradited to Croatia to stand trial.
	   Croats often cite Stepinac's comments about Jasenovac to defend
the cardinal as a religious leader who was struggling to make the
best of a bad situation during the war.
	   In public statements, Stepinac called the camp a ``shame.'' When
greeting Pavelic at the entrance to the Zagreb Cathedral, Stepinac
quoted the 7th Commandment: ``Thou shalt not kill.''
	   The cardinal's speeches show that as early as 1942, he was
speaking out, albeit carefully, against the excesses of the regime.
	   ``All nations and races are from the God and they all have a
right to live,'' Stepinac said at a Mass in 1942 when killings in
Jasenovac and other camps were in full swing. ``That is why the
Croatian church has always condemned injustice and violence
committed in the name of class, racist or ethnic theories.''
	   Stepinac's admirers also argue that by ``allowing'' Serbs and
Jews to convert to Catholicism, he was trying to give them a chance
to escape persecution.
	   Croatia's Jewish community, which lost 30,000 members during the
war, said they were ``grateful'' to Stepinac for saving the lives
of many Jews. However, in a statement released Wednesday, they said
that ``the time will judge'' him.

Cabinda separatists report Angolan army offensive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Angolan troops supported by attack
helicopters were advancing on armed separatists in the country's
oil-rich enclave of Cabinda on Friday, a Lisbon-based spokesman for
the separatists said.
	   A battalion of 400 Angolan soldiers began an offensive Sept. 28
and are battling guerrillas in the jungle in eastern areas of the
coastal enclave, Carlos Puna said by telephone.
	   He said many people had been killed in the fighting but could
not give specific figures. He declined to give the strength of the
guerrilla force.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the fighting.
	   An unidentified Angolan army source, quoted by the Portuguese
news agency Lusa, confirmed military operations were underway in
several parts of Cabinda but said no major offensive had been
launched.
	   Cabinda is an impoverished 7,000 square-kilometer (4,400
square-mile) patch of Angolan territory wedged between Congo and
the Republic of Congo, north of Angola.
	   Major western oil companies operate oil platforms off the
Cabindan coast and have bases in the enclave's coastal capital,
also called Cabinda. Oil revenue provides much of the Angolan
government's income.
	   A heavy Angolan security contingent in the capital has kept the
separatists in remote inland areas since they launched their fight
for independence two decades ago following Angola's independence
from Portugal.
	   Angola has also deployed troops in western Congo, near Cabinda,
to help President Laurent Kabila quell an insurgency.

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Any doubts that the ferocity of Sri
Lanka's civil war had waned after 15 years ended this week with
three days of often bitter hand-to-hand combat that the military
says killed about 1,200 people.
	   Mustering nearly all their forces, the Tamil Tiger rebels struck
the northern town of Kilinochchi at night on Sunday, nullifying the
government's high-tech arsenal of Israeli-built Kfir warplanes and
Russian MI-24 armored helicopter gunships.
	   Crossing minefields strung with barbed wire in a scene
reminiscent of World War I, the guerrillas fought 3,500 government
soldiers with relatively low-tech weaponry _ grenades, mortars and
machine guns.
	   The rebels _ each with a vial of cyanide around their necks that
they are under orders to bite if they are on the verge of capture _
fought fiercely to seize the town of Kilinochchi, 270 kilometers
(170 miles) north of the capital, Colombo.
	   ``Many people think that the war is at an end, and that it will
die down in intensity. But in fact, as the army gains more ground,
the rebels will hit back with increasing savagery,'' said Harry
Goonatilleke, a retired air force chief.
	   The rebels had attacked Kilinochchi in a bid to control a key
highway that links the government-held southern section of the
Indian Ocean island with the military-controlled northern town of
Jaffna.
	   Complete control of the highway could be a turning point in the
protracted war. The military had controlled two-thirds of it before
Tuesday, when rebels captured Kilinochchi.
	   The battle at Kilinochchi, together with fighting at Mankulam,
30 kilometers (18 miles) south, left 535 soldiers and 620 rebels
dead, the government said.
	   The military's admitted death toll was lower than the figure
that journalists had calculated Wednesday from Red Cross reports,
hospitals accounts and earlier sketchy reports from the defense
ministry. But the final death toll remained uncertain Friday.
	   The rebels turned over 74 bodies to the Red Cross Friday, in
addition to 600 bodies handed over on Wednesday and another 10 on
Thursday. The military said its casualty figure included 262
soldiers whose deaths were announced before the Red Cross
handovers. In Colombo, hospital officials speaking on condition of
anonymity said another 65 soldiers died in hospitals.
	   The military said it captured 26 rebels and only 10 of its
soldiers were missing, presumably taken prisoner by the rebels.
	   The government's loss at Kilinochchi was softened by its
takeover of Mankulam, which rebels had held for a year.
	   Both the towns had been abandoned by civilians years ago,
leading to more vicious fighting.
	   Some military officials believe the rebels struck Kilinochchi
since they knew Mankulam was about to fall and they needed a
victory to boost their morale and international prestige.
	   ``The fall of Mankulam should have been a turning point for the
worse in the fortunes of the (Tamil Tigers). But it has become
almost a hollow victory for the army because of the loss of
Kilinochchi,'' said political analyst Jehan Perera.
	   The military's strategy since peace talks broke down in 1995 has
been to capture the guerrillas' stronghold on the Jaffna Peninsula
and supply it by air and sea until troops capture the
78-kilometer-(48 mile)-jungle highway to link it to the rest of the
government-held area.
	   Jaffna City fell in December 1995, and the rest of the peninsula
and parts of the northern mainland, including Kilinochchi, were
captured a few months later.
	   In May 1997, the army began an offensive for the highway. The
battle for Mankulum began in February 1998.
	   Rebel leaders were determined to hold the town, and as months
passed opposition politicians and newspapers criticized the
military's strategy as taking too long and resulting in too many
fatalities.
	   This week's battles were the biggest since July 1996, when 1,240
soldiers were killed when rebels overran a garrison at Mullaittivu,
280 kilometers (175 miles) north of Colombo.
	   The rebels want a separate homeland for minority Tamils in the
country's north and east, claiming that they are discriminated
against by the majority Sinhalese who control the government and
the military. More than 55,000 people have been killed since the
fighting began in 1983.

Doping scandal widens in Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Twenty-four players of first-division soccer team AC
Parma were reported Friday to have shown altered blood values in
doping tests in July _ a circumstance that could indicate the use
of the banned drug EPO.
	   According to reports published Friday, virtually all Parma
players had hematocrit levels __ the proportion of red blood cells
to the total volume of blood __ of around 50 percent.
	   That is considered a health risk and may indicate the use of
EPO, a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of red
blood cells.
	   EPO, or erythropoietin, boosts oxygen absorption in the
bloodstream. It is the same substance that several cyclists in the
Tour de France are alleged to have taken.
	   Fabio Cannavaro, an Italian national team defender, was
indicated by news reports as the only Parma player not involved in
the scandal.
	   Results of the tests were found in the medical records of Dr.
Alberto Bargossi, who works with Parma. Bologna Prosecutor Alberto
Spinosa, who is conducing a doping investigation, ordered his
office searched.
	   Several doping investigations have begun following remarks by AS
Roma coach Zdenek Zeman, who said last summer that he was amazed by
the quick muscular development of some players.
	   One investigation, done for the Olympic Committee's doping
commission, ended in August without finding evidence of illegal
drug use, but did find that the use of legal muscle-builders is
widespread.
	   On Thursday, the chief administrator of the lab that allegedly
covered up a failed test by a soccer player was fired.
	   Also Thursday, Mario Pescante reiterated his intention to step
down as president of the Italian Olympic Committe.
	   The committee oversees all sports _ amateur and professional _
in Italy. As head of the committee, Pescante became a target for
blame when Italian media reported that sports authorities were
failing to run all the required doping tests on pro soccer league
players.

Greenspan, Rubin efforts to shore up markets not working
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Clinton remarks &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN CRUTSINGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Economics Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton said Friday the United
States has a heavy responsibility to lead the world ``back away
from this financial precipice'' of a global economic crisis,
warning that Americans will suffer if the turmoil continues to
spread.
	   ``We know we are going into an unprecedented time,'' the
president said. ``This country has got to lead. We've got to be
aggressive. We've got to stay on the balls of our feet.''
	   He said half the world is in recession or experiencing very low
economic growth. ``We don't have to have a worldwide recession if
those of us that enjoy growth will take the initiative and move
now. But we just _ we cannot afford to dally around here.''
	   In remarks on the South Lawn before departing for a trip,
Clinton said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan would explore steps with allies to design
new programs of financial help in the International Monetary Fund
``to help countries ward off global financial contagion.''
	   Further, Clinton urged the World Bank and other development
banks to develop a new emergency capacity for loans to help
countries reform their financial sectors and to use loan guarantees
and other means to leverage private-sector lending to emerging
markets.
	   He said the United States would take new steps to encourage
American firms to continue exporting to and investing in emerging
markets hurt by the crisis.
	   ``Now, with these steps we are acting to protect our own
prosperity and to exercise responsible economic stewardship in the
world.''
	   The president called anew on Congress to provide full funding
for the IMF. ``This is terribly, terribly important,'' Clinton
said. ``We can lead back away from this financial precipice but we
need the resources to do it.''
	   Securities markets plunged Thursday even while two U.S. economic
superstars _ Rubin and Greenspan _ were out on the stump.
	   The Dow Jones average suffered its second straight loss of more
than 200 points as investors fretted about whether other U.S. hedge
funds could fail and worried about news indicating Japan is still
mired in its worst recession in 50 years. Losses continued Friday.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ When Pope John Paul II beatifies
Croatia's wartime cardinal this weekend, he will be honoring one of
the Balkans' most controversial figures _ a man denounced as a Nazi
collaborator but hailed by many Croats as a national martyr.
	   Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who will advance toward sainthood
with the ceremony Saturday, was tried by the Communists in 1946 and
sentenced to 16 years imprisonment for collaborating with the
pro-Nazi Croatian puppet state established by the Germans during
World War II.
	   The pontiff was expected to land in the Croatian capital,
Zagreb, at 17:30 p.m. (1530 GMT) Friday for a three-day tour.

<TEXT>
	   KNOKKE, Belgium (AP) _ England's Greg Owen shot nine birdies on
his way to a course-record 62 Friday to move into contention at the
Belgacom Open, four shots off the half-way pace.
	   Sweden's Fredrik Jacobson had a second strong day to take him
into the lead at 10 under par, which allowed him to briefly forget
his back pains.
	   Owen, 26, needed just 25 putts to smash the old record by two
strokes on the par-71 Royal Zoute course in this North Sea resort.
	   ``This is easily the best round of my life,'' said Owen, whose
previous best was a 67.
	   New Zealand's Greg Turned dropped into second place with a 70
Friday for a 8-under half-way total.
	   Owen joined fellow-Englishman Van Phillips and Swede Per-Ulrik
Johansson in joint-third place at 6-under par.
	   Jacobson needs a good showing at the 400,000-pound (dlrs
680,000) Belgacom Open to hold on to his European Tour Card. He has
only won 44,000 pounds (dlrs 75,000) and needs to finish in the top
eight to hold on to his tour card.
	   The Swede has been taking painkillers to keep his Tour challenge
going this week.

Top Olympian Bjorn Daehlie to aid and abet US ski team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Nordic skier Bjoern Daehlie, the winningest
Winter Olympian in history, on Friday announced plans to sponsor
struggling rivals as they prepare for the Olympics at home in Salt
Lake City, Utah.
	   Not that the U.S. Nordic ski team is much of a rival for Daehlie
or other top skiers from this small northern nation of 4.4 million
people that is a superpower in winter sports.
	   Daehlie announced a deal in which his company, Ski Pool Norway,
will supply the latest in hi-tech Nordic ski attire to 50 athletes
and staff of the U.S. cross-country, Nordic combined and special
Olympic ski teams from now through the Salt Lake Winter Olympics in
2002.
	   He would not say how much the sponsorship deal was worth, but
described it as great marketing for his products in the United
States, especially as host of the next Winter Games.
	   ``There are just as many skiers in the United States, strangely
enough, as there are in Norway,'' Daehlie told a news conference in
Oslo.
	   With eight Olympic gold medals, and a total of 12 overall in
three Olympics, Daehlie is the winningest athlete in the history of
the Winter Games. The U.S., on the other hand, has never been much
of a force on the Nordic ski trail.
	   So how are American athletes supposed to feel about wearing
clothes made by the competition?
	   ``Heh. I wouldn't wear clothes that Smirre (rival Olympic
champion Vladimir Smirnov of Kazakhstan) signed,'' admitted
Daehlie. ``I can understand that some might find it demoralizing,
but the team in the United States is so far behind the world's
elite that they might find it inspiring.''
	   Daehlie helped start the ski wear company two years ago, and is
already projecting a 10-million kroner (dlrs 1.3-million) turnover
this year products that include his ``Bjoern Daehlie Technical
Wear.''
	   The Norwegian skier has been in hard training for the coming ski
season. However, it was not clear whether Daehlie, now 31, would
continue his carreer long enough to attempt to personally show
rivals the back of his designer cloths on the Nordic trails of Salt
Lake in 2002.

Report: 100 killed in Sudan tribal clashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ More than 100 people have died in clashes
among tribespeople in western Sudan, an independent newspaper
reported Friday.
	   The fighting started when members of the Abu Darak clan tried to
split from the Habania tribe and set up their own tribe, the Akhbar
al-Saa said.
	   The fighting in the province of South Dafur left at least 100
people hundred dead and ``a large number of persons displaced,''
said the paper. It did not say when the clashes occurred.
	   Akhbar al-Saa said the dispute goes back to 1997 when Abu Darak
clan attempted to assert its independence during a camel race.
	   It said the government plans to mediate between tribal elders
who are now in Khartoum.
	   Armed clashes among tribes in Dafur have been on the increase
since a 1985 drought increased competition among nomadic tribes for
grazing lands.

Zhirinovsky: Russia needs land link with Kaliningrad region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia should swap territory with Poland or
Lithuania so that it has a direct land link to Kaliningrad, its
westernmost region, ultranationalist politician Vladimir
Zhirinovksy said Friday.
	   Kaliningrad, located on the Baltic Sea, is separated from the
rest of Russia by Lithuania and Belarus. Poland is located to the
south, but does not border Russia.
	   Zhirinovsky said that territories of 100 to 200 kilometers (62
to 125 miles) are not crucial to countries, and could be swapped,
the Interfax news agency said.
	   He suggested Russia could give up part of its Smolensk region in
the exchange.
	   Kaliningrad was a strategic naval base in the Soviet era and was
closed to foreigners. It has declared itself a free economic zone.

Latvia at a glance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Latvia-Elections &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Facts and figures on Latvia, which holds national elections
Saturday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GEOGRAPHY: The small country of 65,000 square kilometers (25,000
square miles) occupies a commercially and militarily strategic
position, with the Baltic Sea to the west and Russia to the east.
Also borders Lithuania, Belarus and Estonia.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PEOPLE: Of the 2.5 million residents, little more than half are
ethnic Latvians. Most of the country's substantial ethnic Russian
minority became stateless after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ECONOMY: Latvia has made progress in overcoming the economic
stagnation of the Soviet period, and now reports a gross national
product of about dlrs 5,300 per capita and strong economic growth.
Latvia aspires to join the European Union as soon as possible.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HISTORY: Although Latvians have considered themselves a distinct
nationality for some 800 years, Latvia has been independent for
less than 30 years. The first period was 1918-39, after which it
was annexed by the Soviet Uinion, occupied by the Nazis and retaken
by the Soviets. Latvia became independent again in September 1991,
about three months before the Soviet Union collapsed entirely.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ELECTION: Voters will choose all 100 seats in the parliament,
the Saeima (pronounced SIGH-mah), from a field of 21 parties or
alliances.
	   They also will vote in a controversial referendum on whether to
ease restrictions for people seeking citizenship. Russia has
denounced Latvia's current laws. Rejection of the changes could
provoke a new outbreak of tensions with Russia, as well as
undermine the country's chances of joining the EU.

Cabinda separatists report Angolan army offensive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Angolan troops supported by attack
helicopters were advancing on armed separatists in the country's
oil-rich enclave of Cabinda on Friday, a Lisbon-based spokesman for
the separatists said.
	   A battalion of 400 Angolan soldiers began an offensive Sept. 28
and are battling guerrillas in the jungle in eastern areas of the
coastal enclave, Carlos Puna said by telephone.
	   He said many people had been killed in the fighting but could
not give specific figures. He declined to give the strength of the
guerrilla force.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the fighting.
	   An unidentified Angolan army source, quoted by the Portuguese
news agency Lusa, confirmed military operations were underway in
several parts of Cabinda but said no major offensive had been
launched.
	   Cabinda is an impoverished 7,000-square-kilometer
(4,400-square-mile) patch of Angolan territory wedged between Congo
and the Republic of Congo, north of Angola.
	   Major western oil companies operate oil platforms off the
Cabindan coast and have bases in the enclave's coastal capital,
also called Cabinda. Oil revenue provides much of the Angolan
government's income.
	   A heavy Angolan security contingent in the capital has kept the
separatists in remote inland areas since they launched their fight
for independence two decades ago following Angola's independence
from Portugal.
	   Angola has also deployed troops in western Congo, near Cabinda,
to help President Laurent Kabila quell an insurgency.

Proposed laws would allow more parties, more elected lawmakers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's government on Friday
submitted proposed laws that would allow more political parties in
next year's general elections, and reduce the number of military
legislators.
	   Indonesia previously had allowed only three parties _ the ruling
Golkar party, the Muslim-based United Development Party and the
Christian-nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party.
	   Under the autocratic Suharto, who ruled for 32 years, their
policies and candidates all needed government approval.
	   But since Suharto was forced to step down as president in May
amid widespread protests and riots fueled by the nation's worst
economic crisis in three decades, more than 50 political parties
have been set up.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised
elections next May 26, and greater democratic freedom in the
meantime.
	   Bills on the elections and the shape of new legislative bodies
were presented to the 500-member legislature by Minister of Home
Affairs Syarwan Hamid.
	   Under the proposed laws, he said, the number of parliament
members would be increased to 550 while the People's Consultative
Assembly, which elects the president, would be reduced to 700 from
the existing 1,000.
	   The number of legislators sent by the military will be reduced
to 55 from 75, added Syarwan, who also is a three-star army
general.
	   ``The reduction also is a proof that the assembly under the
`reform era' is mostly made up of elected members,'' he said.
	   Under Suharto, the Consultative Assembly was made up of the 500
legislators and 500 local representatives, public figures and
delegates of mass organizations, all appointed by the president.
	   The new assembly is scheduled to select a president by the end
of 1999. Habibie has said he will be a candidate.
	   Meanwhile, the government also submitted a new draft law on
freedom of expression to replace one abandoned three days earlier
amid widespread criticism that it would limit human rights.
	   Minister of Justice Muladi told the legislature that the bill
was aimed at regulating instead of repressing the people's public
freedom of expression.
	   Such a law, he said, was a ``precondition for the existence of a
civilized nation.''
	   ``Furthermore, regulation on freedom to express opinions in
public is not aimed at meddling in the rights and freedom of
people, but on the other hand at respecting the rights of others,''
he said.
	   One change from the abandoned bill was demonstrations by fewer
than 100 people would not require written applications and police
permits.
	   The law would cover police powers to disperse protests or
rallies if they were deemed unlawful or a danger to life or
property, or to peace and public order.
	   Like the abandoned proposal, the new one would restrict protests
outside the presidential palace in Jakarta as well as places of
worship and military installations across the nation. It would ban
such activities at night.

Dutch stocks plunge in panic selling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with final share prices, ABN Amro issuing
profit warning. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Panic selling Friday drove share
prices to a new low for 1998 on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
	   The 27-share AEX Index ended the session down 5.3 percent or
47.38 points at 848.59 taking the week's losses to 99.23 points or
10.5 percent.
	   The AEX has fallen 36 percent from its 12-month high of 1323.65
points in July.
	   And the news didn't get any better at the final bell in
Amsterdam. Minutes after trading closed, Dutch bank ABN Amro issued
a profit warning, joining a growing band of Dutch multinationals
feeling the effects of the global economic meltdown.
	   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, oil giant Shell and electronics group
Philips also have issued profit warnings.
	   ABN Amro said that profit over the whole year may be flat from
1997. Because of the worsening situation in global financial
markets the bank no longer expects second-half profit to top the
year-ago period.
	   ``The management expects that net profit over the whole of 1998
will be about equal to the strong 1997 profit,'' the bank said in a
press release.
	   When it released its first-half earnings, the ABN forecast that
net profit would rise by at least 13 percent this year.
	   Bank and insurance combine ING announced Thursday that Asia's
financial crisis will cut more deeply into its profit than first
expected.
	   The company said earnings per share will rise by 15 percent over
the whole of the year, about half of the previously forecast profit
growth.

African mine union to set up fund; CORRECTS name of ruling party to

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Officials from four countries mediated
talks Friday between Lesotho's ruling party and opposition groups
to try to resolve political turmoil that led to South Africa's
military intervention last week.
	   About 1,000 opposition supporters gathered outside King Letsie
III's palace as the talks proceeded at United Nations offices down
the road. Intervention troops from South Africa and Botswana _ who
arrived in this mountainous kingdom last week to quell an army
mutiny and a series of strikes _ warily looked on.
	   The South African Council of Churches, meanwhile, said South
Africa and the Southern African Development Community should accept
responsibility for a looting and arson spree that erupted when the
intervention _ launched on behalf of SADC _ began on Sept. 22.
	   Neighboring countries should help rebuild Lesotho, which has
suffered an estimated 2 billion rands (dlrs 350 million) in damage
during the intervention, the church group said.
	   Taking a step in that direction, South Africa's National Union
of Mineworkers said Friday it would set up a fund to help rebuild
essential services. Between 80,000 and 90,000 people from Lesotho
work in South Africa's mines, their wages generating most of the
income of this impoverished land-locked nation.
	   Mediating Friday's talks were South African Security Minister
Sydney Mufamadi and representatives from Zimbabwe, Botswana and
Mozambique, said South African government spokesman Ricky Naidoo.
	   The turmoil in this Belgium-sized country of 2 million _ which
is surrounded by South Africa _ stems from the May elections, which
the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy won by a landslide.
Opposition parties claim the voting was rigged.
	   A regional commission found irregularities in the voting but not
enough to warrant overturning the result.
	   On Thursday, Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili said he would not
share political power, as demanded by opposition groups.
	   Refuting claims that 58 of its soldiers had died in the
intervention, the Lesotho Defense Force asserted in a statement
Friday that 18 were killed and nine injured. Nine South African
soldiers have also been killed, according to official figures.

Latvian referendum overshadows parliamentary poll
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES apostrophes throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL TARM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Whether to make citizenship easier for the
country's huge ethnic Russian population is the top issue for most
Latvians voting in Saturday's elections.
	   In the third national election since Latvia broke with the
Soviet Union, the electorate will pick a new slate of deputies to
the country's 100-seat parliament, the Saeima.
	   But a simultaneous referendum has drawn most attention in the
voting run-up and which has driven the election campaigns of most
of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats.
	   The controversial referendum, if passed, would nullify
amendments adopted earlier this year liberalizing Latvian
citizenship laws, which place high obstacles to citizenship for
700,000 of Latvia's 1.2 million ethnic Russians.
	   Non-citizens are not eligible to vote on the referendum or in
the election.
	   After Latvia regained independence in 1991, citizenship was
granted automatically to pre-1940 residents and their descendants _
leaving stateless most of the ethnic Russians who poured into
Latvia in the Soviet era.
	   The citizenship amendments, approved by parliament in June, were
supposed to signal that Latvia was ready to integrate the Russians,
who make up some 45 percent of the country's 2.5 million
population.
	   Western governments have warned of their disapproval if the
citizenship amendments are overturned. The European Union has said
turning down the changes could foil Latvia's bid for membership.
	   Russia, which has already denounced Latvian citizenship
policies, is also likely to react angrily if the referendum goes
through.
	   Five of the six parties in Latvia's current government coalition
and all the major opposition parties have called on voters to
reject the referendum and let the amendments stand, stressing the
potential damage to Latvia's image abroad.
	   The right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party, a member of the
governing coalition and the party of Latvian Prime Minister Guntars
Krasts, is the only major party campaigning for a yes-vote in the
referendum.
	   Fatherland and Freedom argues that by softening naturalization
rules Latvia has caved in to Western pressure. Its main campaign
poster, emblazoned by a maroon and white Latvian flag, reads,
``Latvians: Don't give in!''
	   Many voters are expected to split their votes, casting ballots
for moderate parties in the parliamentary poll, but voting for the
referendum. On the eve of the election, observers said the final
referendum result was still too close to call.
	   On issues other than citizenship, like the need to seek EU and
NATO membership, there is wide cross-party agreement. There is also
broad support for the free-market reforms implemented in the
country with such success in recent years.
	   Voter support for one party or another seems to depend less on
the issues, and more on the personality of different party leaders.
	   The party that has been No. 1 in most pre-election polls with
around 20 percent support is the center-right Peoples Party, a new
party founded by wealthy businessman and a former prime minister,
Andris Skele.
	   Skele has said Latvia relies too much on transit trade to and
from Russia, and said policies should also focus on producing goods
in Latvia for export.
	   Other parties scoring around 15 percent in opinion surveys
include the rightist Fatherland and Freedom, the centrist Latvia's
Way and the opposition leftists, the Social Democrats.
	   The centrist News Party, led by flamboyant pop music composer
Raimonds Pauls, is also expected to score above the five percent
threshold required to win parliamentary seats.

Four miners killed in accident
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RAISES death toll to 4 from 1. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A sudden eruption of coal and gas trapped
miners in a remote shaft of a mine in eastern Ukraine, killing four
of them, officials said Friday.
	   The accident occurred Thursday at the Bulavinska mine in the
city of Yenakievo in Ukraine's coal-rich Donetsk region, the
Emergency Situations Ministry reported.
	   Rescue teams clearing the way to the miners, who were blocked at
a depth of 530 meters (1,739 feet), found four bodies, the ministry
said.
	   A total of 299 people have died in mine accidents in Ukraine
since the beginning of 1998. That's about 100 more than in the same
period last year, according to government statistics.
	   The number of miners killed on the job has been increasing
steadily in recent years because mines lack the funds needed to
modernize equipment and improve safety conditions.
	   The worst single accident this year occurred in April, when a
methane gas blast killed 63 workers at a mine in the Donetsk
region.

Sri Lanka to seek dlrs 100 million loan as war cost skyrockets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sri Lanka-Savage War &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's government will seek a
loan of at least dlrs 100 million to bridge a yawning budget
deficit swelled by skyrocketing expenditure on the civil war,
officials said Friday.
	   Last week, the government estimated the 1998 defense budget at
dlrs 851 million, a 28 percent increase over an earlier estimate of
dlrs 667 million.
	   ``The sharp increase in defense costs is the major reason for
the government to push for such a loan now,'' said Chanaka
Wickramasooriya, head of research at NDBS Stock Brokers.
	   Total government revenue for the first six months of this year
was dlrs 1.23 billion, while spending was dlrs 1.89 billion.
	   The loan was not on the government's agenda, but efforts to
raise dlrs 200 million by issuing five-year treasury bonds have
been delayed, said the officials who asked not to be identified.
Central Bank and finance ministry officials blamed the Asian
financial turbulence for the bond's delay.
	   No decision has been taken on where the loan will come from,
said the officials.
	   Rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority Tamils
in the country's north and east, claiming that they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese, who control the
government and the military.
	   More than 55,000 people have been killed since the fighting
began in 1983.

Analysts say future hedge fund impact uncertain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Chaos is being created in European stock markets
by uncertainty over the future impact on European banks and
financial institutions of exposure to troubled hedge funds,
analysts said Friday.
	   ``I think at the moment, people are tending to exaggerate the
amount of expected losses,'' said Jean-Pierre Beguelin, chief
economist at Pictet banking group in Geneva. ``People become very
cautious after being very adventurous.'' He said the marketplace
would suffer a lack of confidence for a while because of losses
incurred from exposure to the private investment partnerships.
	   ``Markets are valuing banking stocks on worst-case-scenario
levels,'' said John Paul Crutchley, analyst at Credit Lyonnais
Securities Europe. That means they're counting on the likelihood of
a world-wide recession, as well as larger exposures to hedge funds
and regions such as Russia and Asia.
	   An unsettling week for European banks culminated Friday in the
resignation of UBS AG chairman Mathis Cabiallavetta and three other
top executives of the Swiss banking giant.
	   The resignation followed the announcement last week that UBS
will lose 2.2 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 1.61 billion), largely
because of its involvement in troubled private U.S. investment fund
Long Term Capital Management.
	   The bank's third quarter after-tax loss of up to 1 billion
francs (dlrs 735 million) is due in part to a 950 million francs
(dlrs 699 million) writedown linked to its exposure to LTCM.
	   Another furore over hedge funds broke out Friday, this time in
Italy. Politicians demanded that the government explain the
state-run UIC foreign exchange office's 410 billion lire (dlrs 250
million) investment in LTCM.
	   Hedge funds are largely unregulated and privately managed
investment funds run for large-scale investors and involve borrowed
money on bonds, stocks and other more exotic investments.
	   Hans Kaufmann, an analyst with portfolio managers Julius Baer in
Zurich, said hedge funds were popular with investors in
Switzerland, but no figure could be estimated for the exposure of
Swiss banks and financial institutions because of banking secrecy
laws.
	   Kaufmann said he believed restrictions on banks' investment in
the funds would be tightened.
	   While many market-watchers feel that a worst-case scenario is
unlikely and share-price drops have been overdone, investors see a
range of unquantifiable risks ahead and are playing it safe.
	   Beguelin said there would probably be more losses, ``but
probably nothing to compare with UBS.''
	   Analysts, meanwhile are looking for more detailed announcements
of what UBS plans to do in order to prevent similar mishaps in the
future.
	   ``What the market needs is figures and a clear strategy,'' said
Gerd Ramsperger, analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank's brokerage
research. ``Confidence hasn't been restored yet.''
	   ``They are taking action, that at least is a good sign,'' said
another analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity.

coach &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The U.S. Soccer Federation is within a week of
naming a new coach, and D.C. United general manager apparently
isn't helping Bruce Arena's chances.
	   Earlier this week, dates for the Interamerican Cup between the
South American Copa Libertadores champion, Brazil's Vasco da Gama,
and the CONCACAF champ, D.C. United, were set for Nov. 14 in
Washington and Dec. 5 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
	   With the United States set to host Australia in a friendly Nov.
6 in San Jose, California, the USSF wants to have its replacement
for Steve Sampson, who resigned after the World Cup, in place
before then.
	   But Payne has been quoted as saying he won't release Arena from
his contract until after the Interamerican Cup games. The MLS Cup
title game, which D.C. United is the two-time defending champion,
is set for Oct. 25 in Pasadena, California.
	   ``The Interamerican Cup is much more important than a friendly
against Australia, and I'm sure the USSF would agree with that,''
Payne said.
	   Not necessarily.
	   Even though a victory by United would go a long way to improving
the international prestige of U.S. Major League Soccer and U.S.
soccer in general, Steinbrecher is not as easily convinced as
Payne.
	   ``If (Arena) is selected, we would want him to coach in that
November game,'' USSF secretary general Hank Steinbrecher said
Friday. ``I'm surprised that Kevin is making those statements. It
would be wise if it is the same candidate (Arena), that something
be worked out.''
	   ``I think everyone's making a hasty judgment that Bruce will be
our coach.''
	   Arena has been mentioned as the leading candidate of four
potentials, along with former U.S. coach and current New York-New
Jersey MetroStars manager Bora Milutinovic, former Portuguese
national team coach Carlos Queiroz and former Brazil manager Carlos
Alberto Parreira.
	   Steinbrecher said Payne's comments could possibly harm Arena's
chances, but not necessarily doom them.
	   The USSF could name a player to coach the game against
Australia, most likely captain-sweeper Thomas Dooley, or one of the
other staff coaches, such as under-17 coach John Ellinger,
Steinbrecher said.
	   ``We have a lot of options,'' Steinbrecher said. ``All of this
will most likely be decided by the end of next week.''

<TEXT>
	   Facts and figures on Latvia, which holds national elections
Saturday:
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GEOGRAPHY: The small country of 65,000 square kilometers (25,000
square miles) occupies a commercially and militarily strategic
position, with the Baltic Sea to the west and Russia to the east.
Also borders Lithuania, Belarus and Estonia.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PEOPLE: Of the 2.5 million residents, slightly more than half
are ethnic Latvians. Most of the country's substantial ethnic
Russian minority became stateless after the collapse of the Soviet
Union.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ECONOMY: Latvia has made progress in overcoming the economic
stagnation of the Soviet period, and now reports a gross national
product of about dlrs 5,300 per capita and strong economic growth.
Latvia aspires to join the European Union as soon as possible.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HISTORY: Although Latvians have considered themselves a distinct
nationality for some 800 years, Latvia has been independent for
less than 30 years. The first period was 1918-39, after which it
was annexed by the Soviet Union, occupied by the Nazis and retaken
by the Soviets. Latvia became independent again in September 1991,
about three months before the Soviet Union collapsed entirely.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ELECTION: Voters will choose all 100 seats in the parliament,
the Saeima (pronounced SIGH-mah), from a field of 21 parties or
alliances.
	   They also will vote in a controversial referendum on whether to
ease restrictions for people seeking citizenship. Russia has
denounced Latvia's current laws. Rejection of the changes could
provoke a new outbreak of tensions with Russia, as well as
undermine the country's chances of joining the EU.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Annan turning down the invitation &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off threatened NATO
attacks, Yugoslavia's Serb leadership on Friday invited U.N. chief
Kofi Annan to visit, saying that would help him understand ``the
real situation in Kosovo.''
	   But in New York, Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said the
secretary-general declined the invitation, saying he was already
receiving reports from U.N. officials in the area. And British
leaders warned that time to prevent such attacks was running short.
	   The invitation to Annan, carried by the state-run Tanjug news
agency, came only days before the U.N. chief is scheduled to submit
a report on compliance with a U.N. Security Council resolution,
essentially demanding an end to the Kosovo offensive by Serbian
police and the Yugoslav army. And it threatens unspecified further
action if the demand is ignored _ a condition seen by some NATO
countries as opening the door to military intervention.

Albanians agree on new cabinet

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new government sworn in
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The new Socialist-led government was
sworn in Friday by President Rexhep Mejdani , only hours after
after new Prime Minister Pandeli Majko announced agreement on the
makeup of the Cabinet.
	   Attempts by Socialist Prime Minister Pandeli Majko to reach
agreement with his coalition partners Wednesday and Thursday failed
after a minority party demanded the deputy prime ministership.
	   The Socialists, who held the position in the previous
government, refused to give up the post.
	   The Social Democrats withdrew their demands Friday, and accepted
the posts of minister of transportation and minister of public
works.
	   At the swearing in ceremony, Mejdani told the new ministers that
``your commitment is a sacrifice in this difficult period Albania
is going through.''
	   The government lineup features six new names, including Interior
Minister Petro Koci and Musa Ulqini, who heads the newly created
Ministry of Information. Former Minister of Works Anastas Angjeli
became the new finance minister.

Yeltsin would intervene if new economic program was too strict

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly to
any effort to prohibit Russians from buying foreign currencies,
believing the move would be like bringing another Iron Curtain down
on the country, his spokesman said Friday.
	   ``The president clearly understands that such a ban would be a
clear violation of our rights ... that would mean a return to the
Iron Curtain in everyday life,'' said presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushin.
	   The remarks came after media reports of a government economic
plan in the works that would prohibit Russians from buying U.S.
dollars and other foreign currencies, and institute other strict
economic controls, rolling back seven years of reforms.
	   Though government officials say such a plan is only one of six
possibilities, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Thursday that
he might be forced to take ``unpopular'' measures to rescue the
Russian economy if it does not receive the next installment in a
dlrs 22.6 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and Finance Minister
Mikhail Zadornov flew to Washington on Friday for negotiations with
the IMF over the dlrs 4.3 billion installment.
	   IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to come
up with a sound economic program before the loan is given, and have
made it clear that currency controls and boosting the money supply
by printing rubles are not acceptable.
	   But Primakov said that the country's plan would be dependent on
the IMF loan, not the other way around.
	   No short-term economic plan will be known for another three
weeks, long after the IMF is set to make its decision, said First
Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov.
	   A draft version of the government's fourth-quarter budget would
rely heavily on the IMF loan, the Kommersant newspaper said.
Without the loan, the government would have to engage in major
deficit spending.
	   Calls for Soviet-style controls _ part of the plan drafted by
First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov and leaked to the press
_ have apparently created a rift within the Cabinet. The plan drew
heavy criticism from Zadornov, and Gerashchenko called the idea of
banning foreign currency sales ``a mad idea.''
	   Meanwhile, Russia's stock market dropped by 5 percent to 38.8
Friday, but trading was so light the downward move meant little.
The stock market has continued to fall since the crisis hit Aug.
17.
	   And tax collection was down in September, the result of the
collapse in Russia's banking system, said Alexander Pochinok, head
of the government's finance and credit department. Revenues totaled
14.3 billion rubles (dlrs 875 million), 700 million rubles (dlrs 43
million) less than expected.
	   The government wants to reverse this trend by raising taxes for
oil and gas companies, but the idea is expected to meet sharp
resistance in the lower house of Russia's parliament, which wants
to cut tax rates, Pochinok said.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Four years to the day of his last visit,
Pope John Paul II arrived in Croatia to beatify a controversial
World War II cardinal and touch off a search for lost moral values.
	   The pontiff's special Alitalia plane landed in the capital,
Zagreb, at 17:35 p.m. (1535 GMT) Friday for a three-day tour.
	   President Franjo Tudjman, Zagreb Archbishop Josip Bozanic and
papal nuncio Giulio Einaudi were at the airport to greet the pope.
	   Residents lined the streets leading from the airport to welcome
the pontiff on his way to Zagreb Cathedral.
	   Later Friday, the pope is expected to address the crowd in front
of the Cathedral and to visit the tomb of Cardinal Alojzije
Stepinac.
	   During his papacy, John Paul has beatified 804 people. Stepinac,
Zagreb's archbishop during World War II, is not one that will go
unnoticed.

Farazijn admits possession of EPO, denies using it
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgian cyclist Peter Farazijn of the
embattled Lotto team has admitted possessing endurance drug EPO but
denied ever using it. The Lotto team has also denied any
wrongdoing.
	   The Belgian federation said Friday it planned to rule on the
issue after next week's World Championships in the Netherlands.
Farazijn is not part of the Belgian World Championship team.
	   Belgian newspapers cited Farazijn saying he had personally
bought 12 vials of EPO and stashed it away.
	   When police searched his home part of an investigation into
alleged doping within the Lotto team earlier this year, Farazijn
voluntarily turned over the vials, the reports said.
	   ``Maybe I'll become the only cyclist in the whole world who will
be punished for having EPO without ever using it,'' he was quoted
as telling the Het Volk newspaper. ``How stupid can you be?''
	   Farazijn was quoted saying he had not yet used the drug because
he wanted to do it with proper medical guidance.
	   ``The story is not credible but it is the bitter truth,'' the
paper quoted him as saying.
	   Farazijn was part of the Lotto team that participated in the
Tour de France this summer, when a drug scandal overshadowed
cycling's premier event.
	   ``There is no hurry since the season is over in 10 days. We'll
do whatever we have to do afterwards,'' federation chairman Laurent
De Backer said.

Ukrainian president calls for `corrections' to market reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New grafs 8-9 to UPDATE with Friday's meeting, detail &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma called Friday for
``corrections'' to Ukraine's program of market reforms, but pledged
that reforms would continue.
	   Kuchma did not elaborate in his comments to a group of Ukrainian
economists, saying only that the changes were necessary because of
the country's economic problems.
	   Kuchma urged the economists to come up with recommendations
before a national meeting of economists in November, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Ukraine has suffered economic problems since the 1991 collapse
of the Soviet Union and it has been especially hard hit by the
financial crisis in neighboring Russia, its main trading partner.
	   The Russian crisis has hurt bilateral trade, caused the
Ukrainian currency to fall and led to a withdrawal of investors
from Ukraine.
	   In recent months, Kuchma has implemented some economic reforms
by decree, prompting the International Monetary Fund to release the
first installment of a long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan. Many
reforms, however, remain stalled.
	   National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko was in Washington this
week for consultations with IMF officials. Yushchenko has warned
that the bank would not spend its dwindling reserves to support the
hryvna currency, but has avoided comments on the currency in recent
days.
	   Kuchma met Friday with Yushchenko, Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko and other senior officials to discuss ways to
stabilize the hryvna.
	   The government's press service said they focused on possible
ways to keep the hryvna under 3.5 to the U.S. dollar through the
end of the year. The hryvna has been trading at 3.4 to the dollar
in recent days but trading has been limited.
	   There are wide expectations in Ukraine that the hryvna will fall
even further, and Ukrainians have been stocking up on food,
clothing and household goods to save their fast-devaluing money.

Aid agency seeks extension of Sudanese cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN DAVIES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Unless a cease-fire in southern Sudan's
civil war is extended beyond Oct. 15, the delivery of vital food
aid and the lives of hungry children will be threatened, an aid
agency said Friday.
	   Underscoring its concern, CARE International Secretary-General
Guy Tousignant said the charity _ for the first time _ is playing
an active role in trying to solve a political problem.
	   ``Everyone's talking peace, but we need actions not just
words,'' he said after pressuring the government and rebels to
agree to a cease-fire extension and expansion.
	   Low-level officials from each side were scheduled to discuss the
cease-fire in Nairobi on Monday.
	   A three-month cease-fire to facilitate the aid program ends Oct.
15. The government has said it applies to all of the south, while
the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army said it is restricted to
Bahr el Ghazal province, where the famine is concentrated.
	   Despite the cease-fire, fighting has been raging since Sept. 14
in the southern province of East Equatoria.
	   Hunger is a persistent problem in southern Sudan, where a
15-year civil war often has led to famine because rebels or
government-backed militias burned or stole crops that their enemy
or civilians rely on. About 1.5 million people have died in the
fighting and famines.
	   This year, the resources of Bahr el Ghazal province quickly were
depleted. Aid agencies have distributed about 16,400 tons of food
for an estimated 1.8 million Sudanese threatened by the famine,
according to a World Food Program report.
	   Although the worst of the famine is over, too many people are
still dying of hunger, according to the United Nations.
	   Tousignant said if the cease-fire ends and fighting escalates,
aid workers may have to pull out with severe consequences,
especially for children.
	   ``Many are still too sick to fend for themselves. It is likely
that all the children in our therapeutic centers will die if they
are cut off, once again, from any kind of relief,'' said
Tousignant.
	   CARE is the largest nonsectarian humanitarian agency working on
both sides of the conflict in Sudan. Programs which began 20 years
ago include emergency feeding centers as well as development.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The U.S. Soccer Federation is within a week of
naming a new coach, and D.C. United general manager Kevin Payne
apparently isn't helping Bruce Arena's chances.
	   Earlier this week, dates for the Interamerican Cup between the
South American Copa Libertadores champion, Brazil's Vasco da Gama,
and the CONCACAF champ, D.C. United, were set for Nov. 14 in
Washington and Dec. 5 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
	   With the United States set to host Australia in a friendly Nov.
6 in San Jose, California, the USSF wants to have its replacement
for Steve Sampson, who resigned after the World Cup, in place
before then.
	   But Payne has been quoted as saying he won't release Arena from
his contract until after the Interamerican Cup games. The MLS Cup
title game, which D.C. United is the two-time defending champion,
is set for Oct. 25 in Pasadena, California.
	   ``The Interamerican Cup is much more important than a friendly
against Australia, and I'm sure the USSF would agree with that,''
Payne said.
	   Not necessarily.
	   Even though a victory by United would go a long way to improving
the international prestige of U.S. Major League Soccer and U.S.
soccer in general, Steinbrecher is not as easily convinced as
Payne.
	   ``If (Arena) is selected, we would want him to coach in that
November game,'' USSF secretary general Hank Steinbrecher said
Friday. ``I'm surprised that Kevin is making those statements. It
would be wise if it is the same candidate (Arena), that something
be worked out.''
	   ``I think everyone's making a hasty judgment that Bruce will be
our coach.''
	   Arena has been mentioned as the leading candidate of four
potentials, along with former U.S. coach and current New York-New
Jersey MetroStars manager Bora Milutinovic, former Portuguese
national team coach Carlos Queiroz and former Brazil manager Carlos
Alberto Parreira.
	   Steinbrecher said Payne's comments could possibly harm Arena's
chances, but not necessarily doom them.
	   The USSF could name a player to coach the game against
Australia, most likely captain-sweeper Thomas Dooley, or one of the
other staff coaches, such as under-17 coach John Ellinger,
Steinbrecher said.
	   ``We have a lot of options,'' Steinbrecher said. ``All of this
will most likely be decided by the end of next week.''

Beatification of controversial Cardinal delights Croats

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ When Pope John Paul II beatifies
Croatia's wartime cardinal this weekend, he will be honoring one of
the Balkans' most controversial figures _ a man denounced as a Nazi
collaborator but hailed by many Croats as a national martyr.
	   Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who will advance toward sainthood
with the ceremony Saturday, was tried by the Communists in 1946 and
sentenced to 16 years imprisonment for collaborating with the
pro-Nazi Croatian puppet state established by the Germans during
World War II.
	   The pontiff landed Friday afternoon in the capital, Zagreb,
beginning a three-day tour.
	   Residents lined the streets leading from the airport to welcome
the pontiff on his way to Zagreb Cathedral, where he will address
the crowd. He will later visit Stepinac's tomb.
	   Stepinac died in 1960. In 1991, when Croatia broke from
Communist Yugoslavia, the new nationalist government rehabiliated
Stepinac and hailed him as a national hero.
	   The differing views of his life illustrate the problems facing
this newly independent nation struggling to resolve its wartime
past and define its place in modern Europe.
	   For decades, Serbs and many Jews saw Stepinac as a symbol of the
fascist state that tried to exterminate them. His critics said he
blessed fascist Croat soldiers, maintained contacts with pro-Nazi
leader Ante Pavelic and carried out the regime's order to convert
Serbs, who are Orthodox Christians, to Roman Catholicism.
	   For Croats, Catholicism is one of the foundations of their
national identity. The Catholic faith separates Croats from the
Orthodox Serbs who dominated the former Yugoslavia.
	   Stepinac was portrayed as a martyr _ the victim of Communist
attempts to suppress the Roman Catholic Church and stifle the
national aspirations of the Croat people. Some Croatian media
speculate that Stepinac was poisoned in prison.
	   The editor of Croatian television's religious program section,
Tonci Trstenjak, said he hoped the beatification ``will clear the
slandered face of Croatia.''
	   But the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Nazi-hunting organization,
asked the Vatican to postpone the ceremony until independent
researchers review Stepinac's role.
	   The Vatican did not respond to the request and has not made an
official comment on the controversy. On Friday, its newspaper
L'Osservatore Romano called Stepinac a ``heroic cardinal.''
	   Meanwhile, another figure from Croatia's Nazi-era past _ Dinko
Sakic _ is in jail pending trial for war crimes committed while he
served as commander of the notorious concentration camp Jasenovac,
where thousands of Serbs, Jews and anti-fascist Croats died.
	   Sakic escaped to Argentina after the war and remained free until
June, when he was extradited to Croatia to stand trial.
	   Croats often cite Stepinac's comments about Jasenovac to defend
the cardinal as a religious leader who was struggling to make the
best of a bad situation during the war.
	   In public statements, Stepinac called the camp a ``shame.'' When
greeting Pavelic at the entrance to the Zagreb Cathedral, Stepinac
quoted the 7th Commandment: ``Thou shalt not kill.''
	   The cardinal's speeches show that as early as 1942, he was
speaking out, albeit carefully, against the excesses of the regime.
	   ``All nations and races are from the God and they all have a
right to live,'' Stepinac said at a Mass in 1942 when killings in
Jasenovac and other camps were in full swing. ``That is why the
Croatian church has always condemned injustice and violence
committed in the name of class, racist or ethnic theories.''
	   Stepinac's admirers also argue that by ``allowing'' Serbs and
Jews to convert to Catholicism, he was trying to give them a chance
to escape persecution.
	   Croatia's Jewish community, which lost 30,000 members during the
war, said they were ``grateful'' to Stepinac for saving the lives
of many Jews. However, in a statement released Wednesday, they said
that ``the time will judge'' him.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's defense ministry was ordered
to pay legal expenses to the family of Romania's last communist
dictator for their lengthy battle to get their parents' death
certificates, a defense official said Friday.
	   The children of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu sued the Defense
Ministry in May after an almost 10-year battle to obtain the death
certificates. They received the papers in late September.
	   Ceausescu was overthrown in December 1989 and the couple was
executed by firing squad on Christmas Day after a brief trial by a
military court.
	   The Ceausescus' daughter, Zoe, wanted the ministry to pay legal
expenses because it ``was responsible for this delay.''
	   The Bucharest Court of Appeal agreed, and Thursday ordered the
ministry to pay 500,000 lei, or about dlrs 55, to the state for
legal expenses. Legal expenses are generally inexpensive in
Romania.
	   ``We shall go along with the court decision and we will not
appeal the case because the sum is so little,'' said Lt. Tiberiu
Fratila, a Defense Ministry official.

Last Catholic missionaries pull out of kidnap-prone Somalia, ending
</HEADLINE>
vital service &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Fear of kidnapping has forced out the last Catholic
church workers in Somalia _ three sisters whose hospital provided
vital care for mothers and children, the Vatican's missionary news
service reported Friday.
	   The nuns' departure follows the kidnapping at gunpoint of
another sister working at the SOS charity hospital in the Somali
capital, Mogadishu. The three remaining sisters _ ages 60, 52 and
57 _ left Sept. 26, the Fides news service said.
	   In an open letter to the people of Mogadishu, the sisters of the
Missionaries of Consolation said the decision ``was made necessary
by numerous recent threats'' that have ``made precarious the safety
of our workers.''
	   The group expressed hope for a resolution ``that would permit
our sisters to resume their humanitarian mission in Mogadishu.''
	   The nun kidnapped Sept. 10 was released after three days and
heavy pressure from mothers and others in the general community.
The abductors were sentenced to one year in prison _ the first
trial for kidnapping since the start of civil strife in 1990.
	   Somalia disintegrated into a fiefdom of clans after the ouster
of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Since then, militiamen out
to make money or exert pressure in disputes have kidnapped more
than 100 foreigners, including aid workers.
	   The sisters' hospital was the main provider of maternity and
child care in Mogadishu, serving Somalis without charge. It treated
500 children a week, Fides said.

UN chief has no plans to visit Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan has no plans
to travel to Kosovo, despite an invitation Friday from the Yugoslav
leadership to visit the region, U.N. officials said.
	   Annan has declined the invitation, saying that the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, had just visited the
region and that other U.N. officials were there and were reporting
to him, spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   He noted that Yugoslav foreign minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, had
met with the U.N. chief on Tuesday and suggested Annan visit the
region ``to see for himself,'' what was happening in Kosovo, where
Serb forces are trying to crush a separatist movement by the ethnic
Albanian majority.
	   Jovanovic said he felt Annan was not informed and criticized the
U.N. stance on Kosovo, Eckhard said.
	   The invitation, carried Friday by the state-run Tanjug news
agency, came after an ethnic Albanian man gave human rights workers
a graphic account of what he said was a massacre of 13 ethnic
Albanian men by Serbian police in a Kosovo forest on Saturday.
	   As well, diplomats, journalists and human rights workers
reported seeing as many as 18 mutilated bodies in the forests
around the Kosovo town of Obrija earlier this week.
	   Annan said Thursday that the fighting must stop.
	   ``I utterly condemn these unwarranted killings and excesses by
the Serb security forces and I think violence by all sides must
stop immediately,'' he said. ``If it doesn't stop and we don't have
access to the displaced and refugees in need, there will be a
humanitarian disaster.''
	   His comments came as the Security Council condemned the massacre
and called on Yugoslav President Slobodon Milosevic to immediately
identify and punish those responsible.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's chancellor-elect, Gerhard
Schroeder, will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on
Oct. 9, the Social Democrats announced Friday.
	   Schroeder made his first foreign trip as Germany's future
chancellor on Wednesday, traveling to Paris just three days after
he led the Social Democrats' defeat of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democrats in Sunday's election.
	   Schroeder has assured Germany's allies that the nation's foreign
policy will not change under his center-left government. Schroeder
has also announced plans to meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin in
Moscow.
	   The Social Democrats opened talks Friday with the
environmentalist Greens to form a governing coalition that will
succeed Kohl's center-right government after 16 years.
	   The new parliament is expected to convene for the first time on
Oct. 26, and confirm Schroeder as chancellor on Oct. 27.
	   Details of Schroeder's Washington trip were not immediately
available.

Analysts say future hedge fund impact uncertain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Chaos is being created in European stock markets
by uncertainty over the future impact on banks and financial
institutions of exposure to troubled hedge funds, analysts said
Friday.
	   ``I think at the moment, people are tending to exaggerate the
amount of expected losses,'' said Jean-Pierre Beguelin, chief
economist at Pictet banking group in Geneva.
	   ``People become very cautious after being very adventurous.'' He
said the marketplace would suffer a lack of confidence for a while
because of losses incurred from exposure to the private investment
partnerships.
	   ``Markets are valuing banking stocks on worst-case-scenario
levels,'' said John Paul Crutchley, analyst at Credit Lyonnais
Securities Europe. That means they're counting on the likelihood of
a world-wide recession, as well as larger exposures to hedge funds
and regions such as Russia and Asia.
	   An unsettling week for European banks culminated Friday in the
resignation of UBS AG chairman Mathis Cabiallavetta and three other
top executives of the Swiss banking giant.
	   The resignation followed the announcement last week that UBS
will lose 2.2 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 1.61 billion), largely
because of its involvement in troubled private U.S. investment fund
Long Term Capital Management.
	   The bank's third quarter after-tax loss of up to 1 billion
francs (dlrs 735 million) is due in part to a 950 million francs
(dlrs 699 million) writedown linked to its exposure to LTCM.
	   Another furore over hedge funds broke out Friday, this time in
Italy. Politicians demanded that the government explain the
state-run UIC foreign exchange office's 410 billion lire (dlrs 250
million) investment in LTCM.
	   Hedge funds are largely unregulated and privately managed
investment funds run for rich investors and involve borrowed money
on bonds, stocks and other more exotic investments.
	   Hans Kaufmann, an analyst with portfolio managers Julius Baer in
Zurich, said hedge funds were popular with investors in
Switzerland, but no figure could be estimated for the exposure of
Swiss banks and financial institutions because of banking secrecy
laws.
	   Kaufmann said he believed restrictions on banks' investment in
the funds would be tightened.
	   While many market-watchers feel that a worst-case scenario is
unlikely and share-price drops have been overdone, investors see a
range of unquantifiable risks ahead and are playing it safe.
	   Beguelin said there would probably be more losses, ``but
probably nothing to compare with UBS.''
	   Analysts, meanwhile are looking for more detailed announcements
of what UBS plans to do in order to prevent similar mishaps in the
future.
	   ``What the market needs is figures and a clear strategy,'' said
Gerd Ramsperger, analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank's brokerage
research. ``Confidence hasn't been restored yet.''
	   ``They are taking action, that at least is a good sign,'' said
another analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's new Socialist-led government
was sworn in Friday by President Rexhep Mejdani, only hours after
new Prime Minister Pandeli Majko announced agreement on the makeup
of the Cabinet.
	   Earlier attempts by Majko to reach agreement with his coalition
partners failed after a minority party demanded the deputy prime
minister's slot. The Socialists, who held the position in the
previous government, refused to give up the post.
	   The Social Democrats withdrew their demands Friday, and accepted
the posts of minister of transportation and minister of public
works.
	   At the swearing in ceremony, Mejdani told the new ministers that
``your commitment is a sacrifice in this difficult period Albania
is going through.''
	   The government lineup features six new names, including Interior
Minister Petro Koci and Musa Ulqini, who heads the newly created
Ministry of Information. Former Minister of Works Anastas Angjeli
became the new finance minister.

	   MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton told 1,000
women from throughout the hemisphere Friday that now is the time
for women to make great gains in their political and economic
status.
	   ``If we take our energy and work together ... I think we have a
great opportunity ahead of us,'' she said in a keynote address to
the ``Vital Voices of the Americas'' conference, a U.S. foreign
policy initiative begun last year.
	   If women's voices continue to be heard in city halls and
boardrooms and at the highest circles of political power, reminding
the world that the big issues concern not just women but societies,
then the fruits of democracy and prosperity will be spread more
widely and deeply than ever before, she said.
	   Mrs. Clinton, considered an inspiration by many women at the
conference, said that as she travels the world and meets women in
all walks of life, ``I'm always amazed, impressed and humbled by
the extraordinary human spirit and hopefulness that I find. ... I'm
always with women who inspire me.''
	   Mrs. Clinton was welcomed with scattered cheers from the
audience already on its feet for the arrival of Uruguayan first
lady Marta Canesa de Sanguinetti.
	   Along with encouraging women to pursue greater gains and to
share their knowledge with other women _ a prime purpose of the
Vital Voices meeting _ Mrs. Clinton announced new U.S. government
programs to promote women.
	   The initiatives include dlrs 50 million from the Agency for
International Development to strengthen human rights, justice and
democracy. AID will also increase its loans to small enterprises in
the hemisphere to dlrs 120 million over the next three years, more
than two-thirds of the loans going to women.
	   Women at the conference said they were thrilled Mrs. Clinton
addressed the meeting.
	   ``I wish we could have more women like you around the world,''
Eva Morales of Guatemala said in a speech prior to Mrs. Clinton's
address. ``We appreciate you. We love you,'' she said to applause.
	   Gladys Aida Caballero, vice president of Honduras, said in an
interview: ``I'd like her to be the first woman president of the
United States.''
	   Mrs. Clinton's four-day trip to South America was all about
women, featuring a speech to the first ladies of the Americas
meeting in Santiago, Chile, and a rousing talk Thursday to the
multiparty Women's Political Network in Uruguay.
	   Her campaign for women's rights wasn't just about political
success. It also was about money, including access to credit.
	   Such access ``is one of the surest ways to change women's lives
around the world,'' enabling them to start their own businesses,
generating income for their families, she told the Uruguayan women
packed Thursday into an ornate ballroom of the Legislative Palace.
	   ``Unfortunately, many commercial banks don't see women as good
credit risks,'' she said, despite studies showing poor women paid
off their debts at a rate of 95 percent to 99 percent.

Ukraine's parliament rejects presidential decree on savings fund
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Friday refused to
approve President Leonid Kuchma's decree establishing a state fund
to compensate people for savings lost in banks.
	   Deputies voted 240-47 to prepare a revised version of the decree
and debate it later in the month. They must consider the decree by
Oct. 10, or else it automatically takes effect under the
constitution.
	   Leftist factions, which voted against the proposed legislation,
said it would not fully guarantee the return of savings lost during
the financial instability that has recently hit Ukraine.
	   The fund Kuchma proposed to establish would have accumulated
money in a special National Bank account and repay people in case
the bank they kept their savings in went bankrupt or became
insolvent.
	   Although the decree provided for compensation of deposits
amounting only to 500 hryvna (dlrs 147 at the current exchange
rate), its authors said it would cover more than 90 percent of
Ukrainians who keep their money in banks.
	   The measure was meant to prevent mass withdrawals of deposits
that most Ukrainian banks have already experienced as people,
scared by the fall of the national currency and the turmoil in
neighboring Russia, started to stock up on food, clothing and
household goods.
	   Government officials say that Ukrainians have recently withdrawn
at least 10 percent of the 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 882 million) they
deposited in banks.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia's Serb leadership invited
U.N. chief Kofi Annan to visit, saying Friday it would help him
understand ``the real situation in Kosovo'' after international
condemnation of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians and the
threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   But in New York, Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said the
secretary-general declined, saying he was already receiving reports
from U.N. officials in the area.
	   The invitation, carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency,
came after an ethnic Albanian man gave human rights workers a
graphic account of what he said was a Saturday massacre of 13
ethnic Albanian men by Serbian police in a Kosovo forest.
	   The Serb invitation also came days before Annan is scheduled to
submit a report on compliance with a U.N. Security Council
resolution demanding an end to the Kosovo offensive by Serbian
police and the Yugoslav army. The resolution threatens unspecified
further action if the demand is ignored _ a condition seen by some
NATO countries as opening the door to military intervention.
	   Serb police have denied killing civilians, and Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said Thursday in Washington that his
government is willing to let an international team take part in an
investigation to ``establish and prove the facts.''
	   The Foreign Ministry in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade said
invitations had already gone out to forensic experts from Finland.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown in
February against rebels in Kosovo who are seeking independence for
the province in southern Serbia that is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   On Thursday, Peter Bouckaert of New York-based Human Rights
Watch said the wounded ethnic Albanian man, whose name was not
released to protect him, recounted how he survived the Saturday
massacre. The man's story was corroborated by other witnesses from
Golubovac, a village three miles (five kilometers) from Donje
Obrinje, the site of another massacre, Bouckaert said.
	   Relating the man's account, Bouckaert said Serb police sent old
men into nearby woods to tell refugees it was safe to come out of
their hiding place.
	   Police then selected about 20 to 25 of the men; the older ones
were eventually let go. The rest were forced to lie on their
stomachs with their hands behind their heads. All were beaten and
kicked and told if they would say who in the group belonged to the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, the rest could go free.
	   Finally, ``one policeman executed them all with short bursts of
automatic fire,'' Bouckaert said the survivor told him. After two
trips up and down the line, the policemen kicked each victim.
	   The man said he waited about 10 or 15 minutes, then fled home,
where his mother and wife waited, according to Bouckaert.
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council condemned ``those
responsible'' for the bloodletting in Kosovo, but Britain and the
United States failed to convince Russia and China to specifically
blame the Serbs. The council called on Milosevic to identify, find
and punish the killers.
	   Amid warnings of military strikes, President Bill Clinton said
Friday that the United States and its allies must remain ``very,
very strong'' in demanding that Milosevic loosen his stranglehold
on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   ``We cannot allow this conflict to spread again and risk what we
stopped in Bosnia starting over again in Kosovo,'' Clinton said.
	   Britain, among the most vocal supporters of NATO action as a
last resort, delivered strong warnings Friday.
	   ``This is a humanitarian disaster,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair
told Channel 4 TV News in London. ``I believe it will only be
stopped if Milosevic gets the clearest possible message ... namely,
if you carry on doing this, you will face a military penalty.''
	   But Russia's parliament declared Friday that any NATO military
action taken without U.N. approval would be considered an ``illegal
act of aggression.''
	   On Thursday, Serbian Deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj threatened
retaliation against NATO personnel outside Yugoslavia if the
alliance launched strikes against Yugoslav or Serbian targets to
stop the bloodshed in Kosovo. In Bosnia on Friday, spokesman Maj.
Richard Saint-Louis said NATO troops there will protect themselves
if attacked.
	   Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo support independence, although
many Western nations do not, fearing it could further destabilize
the Balkans.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department urged Americans in
Yugoslavia to consider leaving. Spokesman James Rubin said military
action is closer to a reality ``because of Belgrade's failure to
comply with the requirements of the international community.''

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Four years to the day of his last visit,
Pope John Paul II arrived in Croatia to beatify a controversial
World War II cardinal and touch off a search for lost moral values.
	   The pontiff's special Alitalia plane landed in the capital,
Zagreb, at 17:35 p.m. (1535 GMT) Friday for a three-day tour.
	   President Franjo Tudjman, Zagreb Archbishop Josip Bozanic and
papal nuncio Giulio Einaudi were at the airport to greet the pope.
	   The pope kissed Croatian soil held up to him in a bowl.
	   Visiting the area that was devastated in the 1991 war between
Croats and the country's ethnic Serb minority, the pope called for
reconciliation among different ethnic and religious groups and
efforts for greater democracy.
	   ``I hope most fervently that in this part of Europe there will
never again be repetition of the inhuman situations which we have
repeatedly seen in the century,'' the pontiff said in the speech at
the airport.
	   Speaking in Croatian, he addressed the country's emergence from
both communism and war, saying: ``Croatia is finally experiencing a
period of peace and freedom.''

 &UR; Russian companies keep billions outside of country &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian companies stashed about dlrs 2.5 billion
outside the country in September alone, the Interfax news agency
quoted the central bank as saying Friday.
	   The central bank did not indicate how it came up with the
figure.
	   The problem of capital flight has increased since Russia
released most economic controls in 1992, Central Bank Chairman
Viktor Gerashchenko told lawmakers in the lower house of
parliament, the State Duma, on Friday.
	   He said talks with foreign authorities would be needed to stem
the outflow of money from Russia, although he noted the best weapon
against capital flight would be attractive investment conditions at
home.
	   Gerashchenko said the central bank is attempting to close
loopholes that have allowed companies to evade restrictions and
send capital abroad, Interfax said. It did not provide further
details.
	   Many analysts say Russian capital flight is likely to worsen in
the wake of the government's plans to reintroduce Soviet-era
measures to strictly control foreign trade and hard currency
transactions.
	   The proposals have spooked large Russian exporters and other
domestic producers, who have already been hard hit by the financial
crisis.

Report: Argentine joblessness up slightly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's unemployment rate
rose slightly in August to 13.5 percent, up from 13.2 percent in
May, said a major newspaper Friday in citing partial government
data.
	   Unnamed government officials, quoted by Clarin, cautioned that
the data could shift up or down slightly once final figures are in
and the official jobless report is released Oct. 9.
	   Clarin quoted the officials as blaming international economic
turmoil for the slight rise. They added that joblessness could
continue to rise later in the year.
	   A figure of 13.5 percent unemployment would mean about 1.7
million workers are unemployed in Argentina, Clarin reported. It
said partial data showed an additional 13 percent of workers were
underemployed, or working less than 35 hours a week.
	   Together, the unemployed and underemployed could total 3.5
million, Clarin said.

	   The latest set of documents from the independent counsel is to
be released by the House Judiciary Committee about 1630 GMT Friday.
The material runs about 4,800 pages in three bound volumes from the
Government Printing Office.
	   It includes transcripts of taped conversations between Monica
Lewinsky and her former friend Linda Tripp, as well as transcripts
of key grand jury testimony from Tripp, President Clinton's
personal secretary, Betty Currie; Clinton's friend, Vernon Jordan;
and White House Secret Service agents.
	   AP will move excerpts on World Service circuits. We will begin _
as soon as possible _ with material from the Tripp tapes and follow
with grand jury transcripts. We will advise further with estimates
of word count and timing as we know more.
	   Because of the amount of copy, we will not move full texts of
the tapes or testimony on World Service circuits.
	   We will provide the documents on an ftp site and to users on the
Web at our official documents page, when they are available
electronically. However, that may not be until several hours after

Presidential election: much suspense, few candidates, one voter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS thruout to raise references to Assad, Lahoud; TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The vote in Lebanon's presidential race
must be held by Oct. 23, but the likely favorite has yet to
declare, and the only voter who counts _ Syrian President Hafez
Assad _ has yet to make his own decision known.
	   The 128-member Parliament must elect the president _ the first
new head of state to be chosen in peacetime in nearly three decades
by Oct. 23 _ to allow a transition before President Elias Hrawi
leaves office Nov. 24.
	   The reality is that no one can win until Syria, Lebanon's
dominant neighbor, makes its preference known.
	   The most popular candidate with the public _ although he has not
declared his candidacy _ is the army commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud,
who enjoys good relations with Syria. Assad has not sent word on
how he will cast his all-important ballot.
	   Although there are no campaign rallies or fiery speeches, the
race dominates newspapers and TV news. The news is all about
backroom wrangling and trips to Damascus, a three-hour drive away,
by politicians seeking signals from Syria.
	   And despite their lack of say in the outcome, most Lebanese are
hoping a new head of state will bring much needed optimism _ and
political stability _ as the nation still struggles to recover from
the devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   As it is now, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's multibillion dollar
reconstruction program has been repeatedly stymied by feuding among
the nation's president, prime minister and Parliament speaker.
	   ``The Elections Are Lost Between Fast Track and Delay,'' said a
headline in the newspaper Ad-Diyar Friday.
	   ``It is still early,'' Hariri said this week after a visit to
Damascus, replying to a question about when the presidential
question would be decided.
	   In this tiny, politically weak country of 3.2 million people,
the choice has always depended on outside forces _ Syria, which
maintains 30,000 troops here, the United States and Lebanon's
traditional patron France _ as well as competing interests inside
the country.
	   Still, Syria must consider internal factors such as public
acceptance of the candidate _ the president is always a Maronite
Catholic under a tradition that makes the prime minister a Sunni
Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim.
	   Lahoud, 62, faces an array of declared and undeclared
candidates, including three Cabinet ministers and three opposition
politicians. And should he declare, the constitution must be
amended to allow active senior state employees to run.
	   That shouldn't be a problem. Three years ago, when Hrawi's
single, constitutionally limited six-year term was running out, the
pro-Syrian Parliament created an extension desired by Syria. And
another extension this time around is still not completely ruled
out.
	   While awaiting Assad's word may be frustrating, it's better than
the violence surrounding the presidency during the civil war when
two elected heads of state were assassinated.
	   One elected president, Bashir Gemayel, was killed in a bomb
explosion 10 days before he could take office in 1982. In 1989,
President Rene Mouawad was assassinated after only 17 days in
office.

Ex-employee hijacks corporate plane in southern France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police identifying hijacker, saying his lawyer
played part in freeing hostages, raises reference to all released
unharmed, ADDS quote from lawyer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARIGNANE, France (AP) _ A former aerospace employee hijacked a
company plane with 15 people aboard Friday, forcing the pilot to
land at an airport outside Marseille.
	   After a 2 1/2 hour ordeal, the passengers and crew were freed
unharmed, police said.
	   The plane, identified as a Falcon 20 belonging to Serge Dassault
Aviation, landed at Marseille-Marignane Airport at 12:30 p.m. (1030
GMT) after being hijacked during a flight from Paris, Marseille
police said.
	   The hijacker was a former Dassault employee. He was armed with a
shotgun and grenades and immediately demanded to talk to his
lawyer, the police said on customary anonymity.
	   The hijacker, identified as 55-year-old Lucien Diaz, left the
jetmaker six years ago. Police said the hijacking was a result of
him being upset after his application for a liquor license for a
bar was rejected.
	   His lawyer, Gilbert Collard, arrived at the airport shortly
after the plane landed and helped negotiate the release of the
hostages, police said.
	   Collard described Diaz as ``a desperate man in a totally nervous
state,'' adding that by hijacking the plane he was trying to draw
media attention to a court case he is currently involved in. The
lawyer did not elaborate.
	   The plane ferries employees between the corporate headquarters
near Paris and the company's plant in the southern city of Istres.
	   Dassault builds fighter planes including the Mirage and Rafale,
as well as civilian planes including the Falcon.

Beirut film festival opens with more than 50 films
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZEINA KARAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The International Beirut Film Festival
opened Friday with an award-winning movie about Lebanon's 15 year
civil war, and scheduled more movies about social and sectarian
conflicts in other countries.
	   The week long festival features more than 50 international,
Arab, Iranian and Lebanese films, including ``Welcome to Sarajevo''
by American director Michael Winterbottom.
	   The movie _ a collection of true stories of the 1992-95 Bosnian
civil war _ is about a journalist and his feeling of powerlessness.
It is also about his attempts to strike a balance between his job
and his desire to help war victims.
	   Organizers say the festival, which is in its second year, aims
to encourage international co-production with Lebanon where the
movie industry is virtually non-existent.
	   Among other prominent movies that will be screened is ``Train to
Pakistan'' by Pamela Rooks, a screen adaptation of a novel by
Indian author Khushwant Singh.
	   The story is set in 1947 during the partition of the former
British colonial India into a predominantly Hindu India and an
Islamic Pakistan. The event led to one of the worst religious
carnages in history as Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs killed each other.
	   War is also the theme of most other Lebanese films, particularly
the student entries, which highlight the horrors of the 1975-90
civil war that claimed 150,000 lives.
	   The tragedy is depicted best in Friday's show of ``West
Beirut,'' a French-Lebanese co-production that won its director,
Lebanese Ziad Doueiri of Lebanon, the Rothman's World Film
International Critics Award for first-time film-makers at the
Toronto Film Festival and two awards at Cannes.
	   ``West Beirut'' sees Lebanon's violence through the eyes of
Muslim teenagers Tarek and his friend Omar and their Christian
neighbor May.
	   Tarek is more than happy when school shuts down on April 13,
1975 _ the day civil war broke out. But as Beirut slips into
anarchy, Tarek finds himself wishing classes would resume.
	   A notable Arab films is ``Keswa _ The Lost Thread,'' in which
Tunisian director Kalthoum Bornaz tells the tale of a young woman
who had escaped her destiny set forth by traditions by eloping with
the man she loves.
	   Renowned Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami's award-winning
``Taste of Cherry'' tackles the issue of suicide, a taboo subject
in Iran where the government has controlled movie-making since the
1979 Islamic Revolution.
	   Awards will be given in six categories: international features,
Arab features, Lebanese feature films, Lebanese short films,
Lebanese documentaries and Lebanese student films.

 &UR; Eds: TOPs with 10 grafs to UPDATE Dow recovering in the afternoon,

 &UR; By BRUCE MEYERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street was trying to bounce back Friday
from a global selloff that knocked nearly 6 percent off the Dow
industrials over the previous three days.
	   But European stocks closed mostly lower and Asian markets turned
in a mixed performance.
	   The Dow Jones industrials, down 476.31 over the past three
sessions, was up as much as 56.64 in the early going as
bargain-hunters emerged, then retreated to a loss of 102.22 before
trying once more to rebound. The Dow was up 67.71 at 7,700.24 by
early afternoon. Broader indicators turned mixed and were well
above the day's lows in active trading that was running below
Thursday's heavy pace.
	   More money also flowed into U.S. government bonds, a traditional
haven for cash in times of uncertainty. Interest rates on Treasury
bonds, which move in the opposite direction from bond prices, were
falling further Friday after dropping to 30-year lows in each of
the past three days.
	   The Dow's latest slide included back-to-back losses of more than
200 points on Wednesday and Thursday. Traders remain worried about
a global economic slowdown that is cutting the profits of U.S.
companies and fears of further fallout from the near-collapse last
week of Long-Term Capital Management LP hedge fund.
	   President Bill Clinton warned Friday that half the world either
is in recession or experiencing very low economic growth. He said
the United States has a heavy responsibility to lead the world
``back away from this financial precipice.''
	   There was fresh evidence of a cooling of the U.S. economy as the
government reported a small rise in the unemployment rate and a
slowdown in the growth of new jobs.
	   The unemployment rate was 4.6 percent in September, compared
with 4.5 percent during the three previous months and a 28-year low
of 4.3 percent in April and May. In addition, the government said
employers added only 69,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, the
weakest figure since a blizzard in the Northeast forced businesses
to cut payrolls in January 1996.
	   European markets were beset by worries about recession and
further fallout from the dlrs 3.6 billion rescue of the hedge fund.
On Friday, the chairman resigned at the Swiss bank UBS AG, which
has said it will lose dlrs 1.6 billion as a result of its
involvement with Long-Term Capital Management.
	   London's key index closed down 3.1 percent, and indicators were
off 6.2 percent in Frankfurt, Germany, and 4.2 percent in Zurich,
Switzerland. But the main index managed to close with a slight gain
of 1.13 points in Paris, a mere fraction of a percent.

State Duma: NATO attack over Kosovo would be unprovoked aggression
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin comment. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The problems in Kosovo cannot be solved by the use
of outside force, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Friday.
	   Primakov also reiterated the Russian position that any NATO
military action over Kosovo requires authorization from the United
Nations, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Primakov made his comments in a telephone conversation with
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Earlier Friday, Russia's parliament also declared that any NATO
military action over Kosovo taken without U.N. approval would be
considered an ``illegal act of aggression.''
	   In a unanimous resolution, the State Duma said it would review
all agreements between NATO and Russia if the western alliance were
to opt for force against Yugoslavia.
	   Such a decision ``may cause irreparable harm to the
international security system fixed in the U.N. Charter,'' the
resolution said.
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution passed last week urges a
cease-fire and threatens to consider ``further action and
additional measures'' if the belligerents continue fighting in
Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia.
	   The NATO allies have not yet resolved their differences over
whether a further U.N. resolution is needed to launch airstrikes.
NATO authorities requested Thursday that the member countries come
forward with specific offers of weapons for possible airstrikes,
but a final decision about whether to use force won't likely be
made until next week.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov warned that ``if a single bomb or
rocket is dropped in Serbia, the Yugoslav army will retaliate ...
and this can trigger a full-scale war,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   The Duma said it would consider renewing military-technical
cooperation with Yugoslavia in the event of a NATO strike.
	   It called on both sides in the Kosovo conflict to cease fighting
and start peace talks, and appealed to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to fulfill the agreement he struck with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin in Moscow in June.
	   That agreement called for Yugoslav authorities to provide
security for the civilian population of Kosovo, create conditions
for the return of refugees and prosecute those responsible for
crimes against civilians.
	   Yeltsin called again Friday for a diplomatic solution to the
fighting in a telephone call with Finish President Martti
Ahtisaari, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.

Hingis retires in semifinal match against fellow Swiss
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, Agassi beating Korda &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Top-ranked Martina Hingis, suffering from
cramps, squandered a 5-1 lead and a match point and then retired at
5-5 in the third set against Patty Schnyder in the semifinals of
the Grand Slam Cup Friday.
	   ``I have to get into a better shape,'' Hingis said.
	   In a men's quarterfinal, Andre Agassi rallied to beat Petr Korda
4-6, 6-0, 6-1.
	   Korda, the Australian Open champion, was the only men's Grand
Slam winner in the tournament that nominally brings together
players with best records at the four Grand Slam events of the year
_ the Australian, French and U.S. Opens and Wimbledon.
	   Agassi, a wild card, dropped his serve to lose the first set but
then went on a roll, winning the next eight games.
	   Korda's double-fault at match point was typical of his
performance: 16 double-faults and 39 unforced errors.
	   Hingis had won the first set 7-5, while Schnyder took the
second, also 7-5, in the first showdown between the two Swiss
teen-agers.
	   In the third, Hingis raced to a 5-1 lead and held a match point
at 5-3, but she netted a backhand to waste it. She also questioned
two calls that went against her as she dropped her serve.
	   Schnyder held serve to come within a game of equaling the score.
During the changeover, Hingis had her thighs massaged by a trainer.
	   Back on court, she had trouble running as Schnyder hit the
corners. Hingis quickly lost the game and with the score at 5-5,
she retired, after two hours and 11 minutes.
	   ``I think I would have won those two games, but it's true, she
retired and I didn't really win it,'' Schnyder said.
	   ``In a regular tournament or in a Grand Slam, she would have
played those last two games, even at the risk of a major injury,''
Schnyder said. ``But this is not a tournament where you can win
points and she's got a few tournaments coming up where she has to
defend her No. 1 position.''
	   Hingis admitted as much. ``Why continue? I would have had no
chance anyway.''
	   ``I didn't want to suffer more, to get a worse injury,'' she
said. ``I still want to play the next two tournaments.''
	   Hingis turned 18 on Wednesday, while Schnyder, ranked No. 9 in
the world, is 19. The two helped Switzerland win the Fed Cup two
weeks ago over Spain.
	   Hingis said she also cramped in the Fed Cup against Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario.
	   ``I haven't had enough time to recover since the U.S. Open, but
I also have to work on my fitness,'' she said.
	   Next week, Hingis is scheduled to play in Filderstadt, Germany,
where she could lose the top ranking to Lindsay Davenport.
	   After winning three of the four Grand Slam tournaments last year
(Australian Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open) and reaching the final
of the French Open, Hingis captured only one this year _ the first
one in Australia.
	   Since then, Hingis has won only three more titles, at Indian
Wells, Hamburg and Rome, and she lost the U.S. Open final to
Davenport, her third loss to the American this year.
	   Including the Fed Cup, Hingis' singles record this year is now
60-11.
	   By reaching the final, Schnyder made sure of earning at least
dlrs 400,000 _ and would get dlrs 800,000 for winning the event.
	   Women are playing the dlrs 6.7 million tournament for the first
time. The men's champion will receive dlrs 1.3 million. There are
no ranking points at stake.
	   Hingis got dlrs 200,000, plus a dlrs 100,000 bonus for her
Australian Open title.
	   Korda, winner here in 1993, received a bye into the
quarterfinals and for one match made a total of dlrs 300,000 _
including a dlrs 125,000 bonus for his Australian Open title.
	   Agassi is guaranteed dlrs 325,000 for reaching the semifinals.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street was trying to bounce back Friday
from a global selloff that knocked nearly 6 percent off the Dow
industrials over the previous three days.
	   But European stocks closed mostly lower and Asian markets turned
in a mixed performance.
	   The Dow Jones industrials, down 476.31 over the past three
sessions, was up as much as 56.64 in the early going as
bargain-hunters emerged, then retreated to a loss of 102.22 before
trying once more to rebound. The Dow was up 67.71 at 7,700.24 by
early afternoon. Broader indicators turned mixed and were well
above the day's lows in active trading that was running below
Thursday's heavy pace.
	   More money also flowed into U.S. government bonds, a traditional
haven for cash in times of uncertainty. Interest rates on Treasury
bonds, which move in the opposite direction from bond prices, were
falling further Friday after dropping to 30-year lows in each of
the past three days.
	   The Dow's latest slide included back-to-back losses of more than
200 points on Wednesday and Thursday. Traders remain worried about
a global economic slowdown that is cutting the profits of U.S.
companies and fears of further fallout from the near-collapse last
week of Long-Term Capital Management LP hedge fund.
	   President Bill Clinton warned Friday that half the world either
is in recession or experiencing very low economic growth. He said
the United States has a heavy responsibility to lead the world
``back away from this financial precipice.''
	   There was fresh evidence of a cooling of the U.S. economy as the
government reported a small rise in the unemployment rate and a
slowdown in the growth of new jobs.
	   The unemployment rate was 4.6 percent in September, compared
with 4.5 percent during the three previous months and a 28-year low
of 4.3 percent in April and May. In addition, the government said
employers added only 69,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, the
weakest figure since a blizzard in the Northeast forced businesses
to cut payrolls in January 1996.
	   European markets were beset by worries about recession and
further fallout from the dlrs 3.6 billion rescue of the hedge fund.
On Friday, the chairman resigned at the Swiss bank UBS AG, which
has said it will lose dlrs 1.6 billion as a result of its
involvement with Long-Term Capital Management.
	   London's key index closed down 3.1 percent, and indicators were
off 6.2 percent in Frankfurt, Germany, and 4.2 percent in Zurich,
Switzerland. But the main index managed to close with a slight gain
of 1.13 points in Paris, a mere fraction of a percent.

Muslims demonstrate over the banning of five relief agencies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE MWANGI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya, (AP) _ Chanting slogans against the governments
of the United States and Kenya, Muslims in several Kenyan cities
demonstrated against the banning of five Islamic relief agencies
after the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in the Kenyan capital.
	   But in Nairobi, about 100 would-be protesters were frustrated
when a planned demonstration was called off by the Supreme Council
of Kenyan Muslims for ``technical reasons.''
	   Last month the government banned five private Islamic relief
organizations after it said investigations had revealed that
explosives used in the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy were
brought into Kenya in shipments of relief food handled by one of
the agencies.
	   FBI and local investigators arrested suspects linked to the
exiled Saudi Islamic militant Osama bin Laden. Two were transferred
to New York and formally charged with murder and conspiracy to
murder.
	   The blast killed 248 people, including 12 Americans, and injured
5,400 more.
	   In the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa some 5,000 boisterous
demonstrators marched on the office of the representative of the
central government and delivered a four-page statement accusing the
government of persecuting Muslims and acting to please the U.S.
government.
	   There were other, smaller demonstrations in central Nakuru,
western Kisumu and northeastern Garissa.
	   Toward the end of the Mombasa demonstration, some of the
protesters looted stalls selling second-hand clothing and ripped
watches off the arms of pedestrians.
	   ``The government acted on the orders of the American government
which provided them with information that the organizations could
be linked to terrorism,'' said the document, signed by Ahmed
Khalif, Secretary-General of the Muslim council.
	   The document demanded a government apology to Kenya's Muslim
community, estimated by authorities and academics at between 5 to
10 percent of the population of 29 million. Muslim leaders say the
figure is closer to 30 percent.
	   At Jamia Mosque in Nairobi, Imam Hassan Omar charged that some
Muslim leaders had been paid by the government of President Daniel
arap Moi to call off the demonstration.
	   ``From now on, there is no Muslim politician who will speak for
Muslims,'' Omar said. ``We feel that they have been paid by the
government. That is why they called off the demonstrations.''
	   Others complained that the banned relief agencies had provided
many services to Muslim communities, particularly in those in
northeastern Kenya that receive little attention from the central
government.

New East Timor talks scheduled, autonomy plan tops agenda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Indonesia and Portugal will meet at the
United Nations next week to discuss an autonomy plan for East
Timor, a spokesman said Friday.
	   During the two-day talks, which begin Tuesday, the two sides
will set aside for the moment the issue of the final status of the
troubled province, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said. The U.N.
chief's representative, Jamsheed Marker, will chair the talks.
	   During the last round of talks in early August, Portugal and
Indonesia agreed to discuss granting East Timor autonomy and to
further involve East Timor activists in the talks.
	   Portugal, the province's colonial master until 1975, previously
backed nothing short of self-determination for East Timor.
	   Indonesia has offered to grant some autonomy to East Timor and
to release imprisoned rebel leader Xanana Gusmao in exchange for
international recognition of the territory as its 27th province.
	   East Timor is a half island territory with 800,000 inhabitants
about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of the Indonesian
capital, Jakarta.

Nobel committee picks peace prize winner, choice remains secret
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The Norwegian awards committee knows who
will win the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize after a final meeting on
Friday, but in keeping with a strong tradition of secrecy will say
nothing until the Oct. 16 announcement.
	   The Oslo-based committee sifted through a record 139 nominations
this year, including 114 individuals and 25 organizations.
	   Geir Lundestad, the committee's nonvoting secretary, said a
decision has been made but, as usual, would not give the slightest
him.
	   ``We have reached a conclusion. Now we will use the days
remaining to polish the citation,'' Lundestad was quoted as telling
the Norwegian news agency NTB.
	   No clear favorites have emerged for the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize,
which includes a dlrs 975,000 cash award. NTB, an avid Nobel
watcher, said the winner could be linked to Northern Ireland peace
process or a human rights activist, such as Czech President Vaclav
Havel, in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the U.N. Human
Rights Charter.
	   The five-member awards committee refuses to release the names of
candidates, partly to protect some of them from persecution.
	   However, sometimes those making nominations announce them.
	   Such known candidates this year include Havel, U.S. President
Clinton and former President Carter for wide-ranging peace efforts,
Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. official who brokered the 1995 accord
that brought an end to Bosnia's fighting, and Pope John Paul II as
a symbol of peace.
	   Others include Chinese pro-democracy campaigners Wei Jingsheng
and Wang Dan, the Salvation Army, the humanitarian group Doctors
without Borders, and Kurdish lawmaker Leyla Zana, who is jailed in
Turkey.
	   The awards committee often uses the prize to encourage difficult
peace efforts, such as in the Middle East and South Africa.
	   While the Northern Ireland peace process could also use a nudge
forward, so many people were involved, including British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, Irish President Bertie Ahern, U.S. peace
mediator George Mitchell and many others, deciding who to honor
would be a daunting task for the committee.
	   The Nobel Prizes are always presented on the Dec. 10 anniversary
of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swede who invented dynamite and
endowed the Nobel Prizes. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, and
the other Nobel prize in Stockholm, Sweden.

Voet makes new allegations of doping at Festina
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The war of words between former Festina physio
Willy Voet and team cyclists continued Friday when Voet made
further allegations about systematic doping within the Spanish
team.
	   In an interview published Friday by French sports daily
L'Equipe, Voet said that nearly all Festina riders, including
Pascal Herve and Richard Virenque, asked for and took doping
products.
	   Virenque denies taking doping substances, while Herve has said
that he was consistently misled by team doctors.
	   In the interview, Voet said that Virenque ``will go into a wall
to deny evidence,'' of taking the banned doping product EPO.
	   According to Voet, Festina sporting director Bruno Roussel set
up a doping system in February 1994, though illegal substances had
been in use since 1993.
	   Voet said he was asked by team doctor Eric Ryckaert to travel to
Bordeaux twice a year, normally in February and June, to collect
doping products which were supplied by a Spanish Festina team
member in Portugal.
	   ``Each time I would bring 300 doses of EPO and growth
hormones,'' which would cost around 600,000 francs (dlrs 107,000),
h said.
	   Voet said that about 80 percent of Festina cyclists took banned
doping substances, most taking about 80 doses of EPO and 40 doses
of growth hormones a year.
	   Herve, Voet said, was the largest consumer, while Virenque also
took large quantities.
	   The doping scandals that rocked the Tour de France began when
customs officials intercepted Voet in possession of 400 doping
products on the France-Belgium border.
	   The Belgian physio has since been put under formal investigation
and released under court supervision.

Camacho names four Bilbao players for game against Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Breaking with the Spanish team's
traditional reliance on Real Madrid and Barcelona players, new
coach Jose Antonio Camacho named four Athletic de Bilbao to the
squad to play Israel.
	   On the 18-man squad list for the first time for the Oct. 14
Europe 2000 qualifying match in Tel Aviv are Bilbao striker Ismael
Urzaiz and Zaragoza forward Marcos Vales.
	   Bilbao's other players are Joseba Etxeberria, Rafael Alkorta and
Bittor Alkiza.
	   Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, who in the past have frequently
supplied up to 10 players to the squad between them, have this time
each being asked to free just two; striker Raul Gonzalez and
sweeper Fernando Hierro from Real and midfielder Luis Enrique
Martinez and defender Sergi Barjuan from Barcelona.
	   Camacho took over this month from Javier Clemente who coached
Spain between 1992-98 was sacked after the side suffered a
humiliating defeat against semiprofessional Cyprus in the European
qualifiers.
	   Spain defeated Russia 1-0 in its first game under Camacho,
himself a former Real Madrid player.
	   The squad also includes 'keeper Santiago Canizares of Valencia,
Albert Ferrer, of Chelsea, `Kiko' Narvaez, of Atletico de Madrid,
Toni Gomez, of Espanyol, Michel Salgado, of Celta, Mallorca's
Vicente Engonga, Antonio `Ito' Perez from Betis, Francisco De Pedro
from Real Sociedad and Paco Jemez of Zaragoza.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia's Serb leadership Friday
invited U.N. chief Kofi Annan to visit, saying it would help him
understand ``the real situation in Kosovo'' after international
condemnation of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians and the
threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   But in New York, Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said the
secretary-general declined, saying he was already receiving reports
from U.N. officials in the area.
	   In another bid to head off NATO action, the independent Beta
news agency said the Serbs on Friday invited an ethnic Albanian
negotiating team to a meeting as soon as possible to continue the
``political dialogue'' which broke down last May.
	   ``Unnecessary delay... and expectations that someone from the
outside will be able to solve all open questions... instead of
Kosovo's citizens and ethnic communities... can bring no results
but only make life more difficult for people in Kosovo,'' Beta
quoted the invitation as saying.
	   There was no response from the ethnic Albanian side.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, Interior Ministry spokesman
Artan Bizhga said fighting was underway Friday just across the
border in Yugoslavia. Bizgha said Serbs were using heavy artillery
in the clash and that some rounds had landed near an Albanian
border police station.
	   The invitation to Annan, carried by the state-run Tanjug news
agency, came after an ethnic Albanian man gave human rights workers
a graphic account of what he said was a massacre of 13 ethnic
Albanian men by Serbian police in a Kosovo forest on Saturday.
	   Annan is scheduled to submit a report Monday on compliance with
a U.N. Security Council resolution demanding an end to the Kosovo
offensive by Serbian police and the Yugoslav army. The resolution
threatens unspecified further action if the demand is ignored _ a
condition seen by some NATO countries as opening the door to
military intervention.
	   Serb police have denied killing civilians, and Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said Thursday in Washington that his
government is willing to let an international team take part in an
investigation to ``establish and prove the facts.''
	   The Foreign Ministry in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade said
invitations had already gone out to forensic experts from Finland.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown in
February against rebels in Kosovo who are seeking independence for
the province in southern Serbia that is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   On Thursday, Peter Bouckaert of New York-based Human Rights
Watch said the wounded ethnic Albanian man, whose name was not
released to protect him, recounted how he survived the Saturday
massacre. The man's story was corroborated by other witnesses from
Golubovac, a village five kilometers (three miles) three miles from
Donje Obrinje, the site of another massacre, Bouckaert said.
	   Relating the man's account, Bouckaert said Serb police sent old
men into nearby woods to tell refugees it was safe to come out of
their hiding place.
	   Police then selected about 20 to 25 of the men; the older ones
were eventually let go. The rest were forced to lie on their
stomachs with their hands behind their heads. All were beaten and
kicked and told if they would say who in the group belonged to the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, the rest could go free.
	   Finally, ``one policeman executed them all with short bursts of
automatic fire,'' Bouckaert said the survivor told him. After two
trips up and down the line, the policemen kicked each victim.
	   The man said he waited about 10 or 15 minutes, then fled home,
where his mother and wife waited, according to Bouckaert.
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council condemned ``those
responsible'' for the bloodletting in Kosovo, but Britain and the
United States failed to convince Russia and China to specifically
blame the Serbs. The council called on Milosevic to identify, find
and punish the killers.
	   Amid warnings of military strikes, President Bill Clinton said
Friday the United States and its allies must remain ``very, very
strong'' in demanding that Milosevic loosen his stranglehold on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   ``We cannot allow this conflict to spread again and risk what we
stopped in Bosnia starting over again in Kosovo,'' Clinton said.
	   Britain, among the most vocal supporters of NATO action as a
last resort, delivered strong warnings Friday.
	   ``This is a humanitarian disaster,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair
told Channel 4 TV News in London. ``I believe it will only be
stopped if Milosevic gets the clearest possible message ... namely,
if you carry on doing this, you will face a military penalty.''
	   But Russia's parliament declared Friday that any NATO military
action taken without U.N. approval would be considered an ``illegal
act of aggression.''
	   On Thursday, Serbian Deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj threatened
retaliation against NATO personnel outside Yugoslavia if the
alliance launched strikes against Yugoslav or Serbian targets to
stop the bloodshed in Kosovo. In Bosnia Friday, spokesman Maj.
Richard Saint-Louis said NATO troops there will protect themselves
if attacked.
	   Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo support independence, although
many Western nations do not, fearing it could further destabilize
the Balkans.
	   In Washington, the State Department urged Americans in
Yugoslavia to consider leaving. Spokesman James Rubin said military
action is closer to a reality ``because of Belgrade's failure to
comply with the requirements of the international community.''

Hingis retires in semifinal match against fellow Swiss

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Spain won the Fed Cup in 15th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Top-ranked Martina Hingis, suffering from
cramps, squandered a 5-1 lead and a match point and then retired at
5-5 in the third set against Patty Schnyder in the semifinals of
the Grand Slam Cup Friday.
	   ``I have to get into a better shape,'' Hingis said.
	   In a men's quarterfinal, Andre Agassi rallied to beat Petr Korda
4-6, 6-0, 6-1.
	   Korda, the Australian Open champion, was the only men's Grand
Slam winner in the tournament that nominally brings together
players with best records at the four Grand Slam events of the year
_ the Australian, French and U.S. Opens and Wimbledon.
	   Agassi, a wild card, dropped his serve to lose the first set but
then went on a roll, winning the next eight games.
	   Korda's double-fault at match point was typical of his
performance: 16 double-faults and 39 unforced errors.
	   Hingis had won the first set 7-5, while Schnyder took the
second, also 7-5, in the first showdown between the two Swiss
teen-agers.
	   In the third, Hingis raced to a 5-1 lead and held a match point
at 5-3, but she netted a backhand to waste it. She also questioned
two calls that went against her as she dropped her serve.
	   Schnyder held serve to come within a game of equaling the score.
During the changeover, Hingis had her thighs massaged by a trainer.
	   Back on court, she had trouble running as Schnyder hit the
corners. Hingis quickly lost the game and with the score at 5-5,
she retired, after two hours and 11 minutes.
	   ``I think I would have won those two games, but it's true, she
retired and I didn't really win it,'' Schnyder said.
	   ``In a regular tournament or in a Grand Slam, she would have
played those last two games, even at the risk of a major injury,''
Schnyder said. ``But this is not a tournament where you can win
points and she's got a few tournaments coming up where she has to
defend her No. 1 position.''
	   Hingis admitted as much. ``Why continue? I would have had no
chance anyway.''
	   ``I didn't want to suffer more, to get a worse injury,'' she
said. ``I still want to play the next two tournaments.''
	   Hingis turned 18 on Wednesday, while Schnyder, ranked No. 9 in
the world, is 19. The two played for Switzerland in the Fed Cup
final loss to Spain.
	   Hingis said she also cramped in the Fed Cup against Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario, although she won that match.
	   ``I haven't had enough time to recover since the U.S. Open, but
I also have to work on my fitness,'' she said.
	   Next week, Hingis is scheduled to play in Filderstadt, Germany,
where she could lose the top ranking to Lindsay Davenport.
	   After winning three of the four Grand Slam tournaments last year
(Australian Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open) and reaching the final
of the French Open, Hingis captured only one this year _ the first
one in Australia.
	   Since then, Hingis has won only three more titles, at Indian
Wells, Hamburg and Rome, and she lost the U.S. Open final to
Davenport, her third loss to the American this year.
	   Including the Fed Cup, Hingis' singles record this year is now
60-11.
	   By reaching the final, Schnyder made sure of earning at least
dlrs 400,000 _ and would get dlrs 800,000 for winning the event.
	   Women are playing the dlrs 6.7 million tournament for the first
time. The men's champion will receive dlrs 1.3 million. There are
no ranking points at stake.
	   Hingis got dlrs 200,000, plus a dlrs 100,000 bonus for her
Australian Open title.
	   Korda, winner here in 1993, received a bye into the
quarterfinals and for one match made a total of dlrs 300,000 _
including a dlrs 125,000 bonus for his Australian Open title.
	   Agassi is guaranteed dlrs 325,000 for reaching the semifinals.

Pope back in Croatia to beatify controversial martyr

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Pope John Paul II visited Croatia on
Friday to beatify a controversial World War II cardinal and set off
a search for lost moral values during his three-day tour.
	   The pontiff's special Alitalia plane landed Friday afternoon in
the capital, Zagreb, four years to the day after his last visit.
	   President Franjo Tudjman, Zagreb Archbishop Josip Bozanic and
papal nuncio Giulio Einaudi were at the airport to greet the pope.
	   The pope kissed Croatian soil held up to him in a bowl.
	   Visiting the area that was devastated in the 1991 war between
Croats and the country's ethnic Serb minority, the pope called for
reconciliation among different ethnic and religious groups and
efforts for greater democracy.
	   ``I hope most fervently that in this part of Europe there will
never again be repetition of the inhuman situations which we have
repeatedly seen in the century,'' the pontiff said in the speech at
the airport.
	   Speaking in Croatian, he addressed the country's emergence from
both communism and war, saying: ``Croatia is finally experiencing a
period of peace and freedom.''
	   Later Friday, the pope is expected to address the crowd in front
of the Cathedral and to visit the tomb of Cardinal Alojzije
Stepinac.
	   During his papacy, John Paul has beatified 804 people. Stepinac,
Zagreb's archbishop during World War II, is not one that will go
unnoticed.
	   Stepinac welcomed the advent of dictator Ante Pavelic's
Nazi-puppet state in 1941 as an incarnation of centuries-old Croat
longings for an independent state.
	   By 1942, Stepinac had become a harsh critic. He denounced the
regime's genocidal policies, which killed tens of thousands of
Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croats.
	   Stepinac's personal notes and recent studies suggest he spoke
out against the atrocities and worked to save lives, but many Serbs
and Jews consider him a war criminal.
	   His critics say he carried out orders to convert Orthodox Serbs
and Jews to Roman Catholicism and lifted his voice when it was too
late.
	   Supporters see Stepinac as a hero for resisting attempts by the
former Communist government to suppress religion.
	   After the war, Stepinac was tried by Yugoslavia's Communist
authorities and sentenced to 16 years in prison for Nazi
collaboration. He died under house arrest in 1962, allegedly with
traces of poison in his blood.
	   The pope is certain to send a sober message to his fellow Slavs.
Zagreb's archbishop, Josip Bozanic, indicated that the pontiff will
address the ``loss of moral values'' in postwar society, growing
materialism and an increasing spiritual void as the fledgling
nation moves toward democracy.
	   In Marija Bistrica, where the pontiff is to carry out Saturday's
beatification ceremony, excitement was swelling.
	   Hundreds of workers have toiled for weeks at this popular Marian
shrine to prepare for up to 400,000 visitors.
	   ``This is the biggest day in the history of our small town,''
chirped 48-year-old Ivanka Ivak, a department store cashier. ``Of
course we're in good spirits.''
	   The mood was also festive in the coastal city of Split, adorned
in the Vatican's traditional yellow and white. The Pope is to
celebrate Mass outdoors Sunday, visit St. Dujam Cathedral and spend
time with youth.
	   Schools and stores closed early Friday, and a giant screen in
Zagreb's main square will provide complete coverage of the pope's
tour.

Poles demand explanation of cyanide pollution by Czech factory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Czech steel factory dumped cyanide into
a river that crosses into Poland, and Polish officials have
demanded to know why the Czech Republic failed to alert them.
	   Experts were called to investigate Monday after dead fish were
reported in the Oder River. Tests found cyanide pollution, but the
amount did not pose a threat to humans, Poland's Environmental
Protection Ministry spokeswoman, Katarzyna Karpinska, said Friday.
	   Poland's Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek raised the issue
Thursday during talks with his Czech counterpart Jan Kavan in the
northern Czech town of Sychrov. Geremek told the PAP news agency
that Poland and the Czech Republic have signed an agreement on
exchange of information on such accidents.
	   International law also requires that authorities inform
neighboring countries of pollution.

Maccabi draws Austria's SV Ried after PSG upset
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS date of UEFA goalposts hearing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Surprise conqueror of Paris Saint Germain
Thursday, Israel's Maccabi Haifa has been rewarded with an easier
game against Austria's SV Ried in the second round of the Cup
Winners Cup.
	   A deflected injury time winner by Alon Mizrahi gave Maccabi a
3-2 victory over the French powerhouse, a Cup Winners titlist only
two seasons ago, just as PSG appeared to be going through on the
basis of scoring more away goals.
	   Liverpool must play Valencia and Premier League leader Aston
Villa faces Celta Vigo in two England vs. Spain matchups created by
Friday's UEFA Cup draw.
	   Italian league leader Fiorentina meets Switzerland's
Grasshoppers while Roma has a tough game against managerless Leeds
United, Parma visits Poland's Wisla Krakow in the first leg when
Bologna hosts Slavia Prague.
	   With clubs segregated to avoid clubs from the same country
playing each other, many of the strong teams stayed apart.
	   But the draw means that the last 16 may be without two of the
three English clubs or two of the five Spanish teams.
	   Although Celta Vigo has drawn all four of its Spanish league
games so far including a 2-2 tie with mighty Barecelona, it seems
to be saving its best form for the UEFA Cup.
	   On Tuesday the Spanish team crushed Arges of Romania 7-0 with
three goals from veteran Bulgarian striker Luboslav Penev.
	   Valencia, whose last European triumph was in the Cup Winners Cup
in 1980, is confident of surprising four-time Champions Cup titlist
Liverpool.
	   ``It seems to us a very exciting tie,'' said club spokesman Jose
Lopez. ``We're going into it very happy. I would say it's 50-50,
but we're fairly confident.''
	   Stuttgart, one of three German survivors, faces Belgium's Club
Brugges having produced one of the greatest comeback in the
competition's history.
	   On Tuesday, Stuttgart scored a 3-0 victory at Feyenoord to wipe
out the Dutch club's 3-1 triumph in the first leg in Germany.
	   In the Cup Winners Cup, star-studded defending titlist Chelsea,
which scraped into the second round after a goalless tie with
modest Swedish club Helsingborg, goes to FC Copenhagen in the first
leg. The Danish club crushed Levski Sofia 4-1 Thursday to gain the
second round.
	   Chelsea managing director Colin Hutchinson said the first leg
mey be moved to Chelsea because the same field at the Parken
stadium will be used the previous day for the Brondby vs.
Manchester United Champions Cup game.
	   Poul-Erik Petersen, FC Copenhagen's sports director, admitted
his team had drawn the toughest opponent.
	   ``But there will be a lot of interest for the Danish people,
because Brian Laudrup will be playing for Chelsea,'' he said.
``There will be high interest to watch a great team like Chelsea.''
	   Lazio, another leading contender, only made it on the away goals
rule after gaining a 2-2 tie with Lausanne and now meets Partizan
Belgrade, conquerer of Ruud Gullit's Newcastle by the same rule.
	   Mallorca has been drawn to meet Belgium's Genk but will be
replaced Hearts if the Scottish club wins its protest that the
Spanish club's goalposts were the wrong size.
	   The two teams tied 1-1 Thursday so that Mallorca advanced 2-1.
But Hearts complained to UEFA that the goalposts at one end of the
Luis Sitjar Stadium were too close together and soccer's European
body will discuss the protest Oct. 8.
	   After a similar complaint last year UEFA ordered the replay of a
game between Spartak Moscow and Sion of Switzerland.
	   Ramon Servallas, Mallorca's director of external relations,
argued that whatever the dimensions of the goalposts, neither team
was favored over the other.
	   ``The protest makes no sense, but they have all the right in the
world to make it,'' he said.
	   ``It must be said that in the morning inspection of the pitch
the goal was inspected'' and UEFA officials found nothing unusual.

Sudan: Mubarak bowing to U.S. pressure on factory bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's official media Friday accused the
Egyptian President of succumbing to U.S. pressure after he said
that a Sudanese drug factory bombed by the United States could have
produced chemical weapons agent.
	   President Hosni Mubarak's statement on the El-Shifa factory
``has been met with dismay in Khartoum,'' the official Al-Anba
daily newspaper said.
	   The United States, which fired guided missiles at the factory in
August, said the facility was producing ingredients for chemical
weapons.
	   Denying the charge, Sudan said the factory only produced
medicine, which accounted for more than half of the country's
pharmaceuticals production.
	   All Arab countries including Egypt supported that stand but in
an interview published Wednesday Mubarak raised the possibility
that the United States was right in its assessment.
	   He said that while the plant was producing medicine, it may also
have been used for making chemical weapons agents.
	   Al-Rai Al-Am, another Sudanese newspaper, quoted Ali al-Hajj
Mohammed, a top ruling party official, as saying that Mubarak
changed his position because of ``American pressure.''
	   Mubarak's state 
assassination attempt on Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Egypt
said Sudan was behind the attempt and that it is harboring the
attackers.

First dispute with Schroeder: Greens seek energy tax hike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with talks ended, quotes, background on Greens.
No pickup. &QL;

 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Coming out of their first formal talks on
forging a new governing coalition Friday, leaders of the Social
Democrats and environmentalist Greens emphasized their strong
desire to form a stable government.
	   Even when differences between the parties came up during the
five hours of talks, leaders on both sides said the mood was one of
consensus-seeking.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat who ousted
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Sunday's election, has said he wants to
form a coalition quickly. The Greens are eager to secure a place in
the national government for the first time.
	   ``The atmosphere was good,'' said Wolfgang Thierse, a member of
the Social Democrat team. ``The differences are known and we'll
have to work them out in the next few days. But in every area, it
was evident that the will to agree was enormous.''
	   One area where the Social Democrats and Greens found quick
agreement was on the urgent need to combat unemployment, stuck
above 10 percent. The sides announced that they would launch a
drive to fight joblessness, especially among young people trying to
enter the work force, after Schroeder formally takes office as
chancellor. He is expected to be sworn in Oct. 27.
	   The teams also discussed energy taxes and nuclear energy, points
on which the Greens' take a harder line. They would like to see a
steep increase in energy taxes as well as immediate steps to scrap
nuclear energy.
	   Schroeder did not comment after the talks. But he has made clear
that it is up to the Greens to adapt their sometimes radical stands
to be a junior governing partner. This could strain the party's
shaky balance between moderates and leftists in the weeks ahead.
	   Accommodating the Greens is tricky even beyond their differences
with the Social Democrats over foreign and defense policy, law and
order and energy taxes.
	   The party's traditional equal sharing of posts between men and
women was already affecting the negotiations. With the Greens
likely to get only three Cabinet posts, two seemed set to go to men
_ with moderate Joschka Fischer as possible foreign minister and
leftist Juergen Trittin pegged for the environment post.
	   But that would put only one Greens woman into the Cabinet. And
to please another constituency, she would likely have to be from
former communist East Germany.
	   The Greens exposed their roots in the European protest and
feminist movements of the 1970s and '80s as the two sides sat down
for their first full-scale talks Friday _ men dominated Schroeder's
13-member delegation; the Greens pointedly sent six men and six
women.
	   Fischer, once a former student radical and now the leading
Greens moderate, has only one goal: getting his party into power
for the first time at the national level.
	   In fact, Schroeder says he could imagine giving the foreign
minister's job to Fischer, a former student radical and pacifist
who has come around to supporting NATO and the deployment of German
soldiers on U.N. missions.
	   To underline the will for harmony, Greens chairman Juergen
Trittin and his counterpart Oskar Lafontaine sat next to each other
smiling at the news conference after Friday's talks. Both said they
were optimistic the negotiations would succeed.
	   But the Greens are not known for party discipline, and members
were making pet demands even as bargaining began.
	   The Greens' budget expert, Oswald Metzger, recommended raising
the tax on gasoline by 26 pfennigs (15 cents) a liter as part of an
``ecological tax reform'' to help lower social security taxes, Bild
newspaper reported Friday.
	   Schroeder, who sits on the supervisory board of Volkswagen and
calls himself a ``car man,'' has firmly rejected the demand. He
says he would tolerate an increase of six pfennigs (3.5 cents).
	   Both parties agreed, though, that any new spending _ for
instance, a promised increase in government aid to families with
children _ must not endanger Germany's economic stability.
	   ``Both partners place a high priority on solid financial
policy,'' Lafontaine said. ``All plans have to be affordable.''
	   Schroeder's party made its stand toward the Greens clear even
before talks began.
	   ``The Greens know there is no room for craziness with Gerhard
Schroeder,'' Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democratic faction leader
in parliament, told ZDF television Thursday evening.

Denktash: EU decision on Cyprus membership setback to settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The European Union's decision to begin
membership talks with the Greek Cypriot government is a setback for
a political solution to reconcile the war-divided island, Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said Friday.
	   ``EU entry for Cyprus is illegal until a political solution has
been reached,'' said Denktash, whose breakaway state of Northern
Cyprus is recognized only by Turkey.
	   The EU has agreed to open talks with 10 East European nations
and Cyprus to bring them into the EU over the next decade but
snubbed Turkey because of its poor human rights record, territorial
disputes with Greece and occupation of northern Cyprus.
	   The Mediterranean island has been divided into a Greek
Cypriot-controlled south and a Turkish-occupied north since a 1974
Turkish invasion following an abortive coup by supporters of union
with Greece.
	   Denktash said that the world would have to recognize that the
Greek Cypriot government did not represent or rule the whole of
Cyprus.
	   ``They have no right to be the government of Turkish Cypriots or
to colonize Turkish Cypriots,'' Denktash told reporters.
	   Although he was at the United Nations for the General Assembly
session he was not invited to speak because his government is not
recognized by the world body.
	   Denktash said he refused to discuss a political solution for
Cyprus until his government was recognized as the legitimate
representative of the Turkish Cypriots.
	   ``We are as good a government as they are and we are as
democratic as they are. Our status has to be recognized as equal to
theirs,'' Denktash said. He said he had insisted on this in his
talks with U.N. officials.
	   The United States is anxious to restart U.N.-sponsored peace
talks that have been stalled since August and to persuade Cyprus to
cancel the planned deployment of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles in November.
	   Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides said last week that his
government was committed to the deployment.
	   Turkey, which maintains more than 35,000 troops in northern
Cyprus, has threatened to retaliate if the missiles are deployed.

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Armenia's desire to improve its
relationship with NATO does not have to conflict with defense
cooperation with Russia, Armenia's foreign minister said Friday.
	   Armenia's ties with NATO should supplement its relationship with
Russia, not contradict it, Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan
Oskanian said during a visit of NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana on Friday.
	   Solana met with Oskanian and Armenian President Robert Kocharian
during his two day visit to discuss the conflict in
Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic-Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan that
has caused friction and violence between the two neighbors,
Oskanian said.
	   They also discussed developing cooperation in science, security,
and personnel training, he said.
	   Solana called the trip ``important and fruitful.''
	   ``I'm sure that bilateral relations with Armenia will continue
and be extended. I'll come back,'' he said.
	   Russia has watched warily as NATO has improved relations with
other former Soviet republics and Eastern European countries.

Soccer union asks government to reverse its suspension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's soccer union, which the
government suspended from running soccer affairs in a doping
scandal, demanded Friday that the ban to be lifted.
	   The Union said that Ilia Gruev, who had tested positive in
April, has already been suspended from the national championship
for three months.
	   ``We consider that the Bulgarian Soccer Union has fulfilled its
obligations ... which gives sufficient ground for its license to be
restored,'' reads a statement carried by the state news agency BTA.
	   There was no immediate response from the government.
	   The government Sports Committee, which is empowered to license
teams and sports organizations, banned the Union in September from
running soccer affairs, saying it failed to comply with domestic
and international law on doping in Gruev's case.
	   FIFA warned last week that Bulgaria may be suspended from all
international competitions because of the ban.
	   Pushed by lawmakers on Wednesday, Committee and Union officials
agreed to negotiate a deal to reverse the ban in exchange for
Gruev's punishment.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's chancellor-elect, Gerhard
Schroeder, will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on
Oct. 9, the Social Democrats announced Friday.
	   Schroeder made his first foreign trip as Germany's future
chancellor on Wednesday, traveling to Paris just three days after
he led the Social Democrats' defeat of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democrats in Sunday's election.
	   Schroeder has assured Germany's allies that the nation's foreign
policy will not change under his center-left government.
	   Schroeder has also announced plans to meet Russian President
Boris Yeltsin in Moscow. A Berlin daily, Der Tagesspiegel, quoted
Social Democratic sources Friday as saying Schroeder also planned
to visit Warsaw on the invitation of President Aleksander
Kwasniewski, possibly before he is confirmed as chancellor.
	   The Social Democrats opened talks Friday with the
environmentalist Greens to form a governing coalition that will
succeed Kohl's center-right government after 16 years.
	   The new parliament is expected to convene for the first time on
Oct. 26, and confirm Schroeder as chancellor on Oct. 27.
	   Details of Schroeder's Washington trip were not immediately
available.

State Duma: NATO attack over Kosovo would be unprovoked aggression
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS NATO Secretary-General's comments, Ivanov's phone calls. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The problems in Kosovo cannot be solved by the use
of outside force, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Friday.
	   Primakov also reiterated the Russian position that any NATO
military action over Kosovo requires authorization from the United
Nations, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Primakov made his comments in a telephone conversation with
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Earlier Friday, Russia's parliament also declared that any NATO
military action over Kosovo taken without U.N. approval would be
considered an ``illegal act of aggression.''
	   In a unanimous resolution, the State Duma said it would review
all agreements between NATO and Russia if the western alliance were
to opt for force against Yugoslavia.
	   Such a decision ``may cause irreparable harm to the
international security system fixed in the U.N. Charter,'' the
resolution said.
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution passed last week urges a
cease-fire and threatens to consider ``further action and
additional measures'' if the belligerents continue fighting in
Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia.
	   The NATO allies have not yet resolved their differences over
whether a further U.N. resolution is needed to launch airstrikes.
NATO authorities requested Thursday that the member countries come
forward with specific offers of weapons for possible airstrikes,
but a final decision about whether to use force won't likely be
made until next week.
	   ``The situation now is very fluid,'' said NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana, speaking in Armenia. As for acting without the
Security Council's permission, Solana said NATO is prepared for a
strike, and ``the most important thing is that (Yugoslav President
Slobodan) Milosevic should stop what he is doing.''
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov warned that ``if a single bomb or
rocket is dropped in Serbia, the Yugoslav army will retaliate ...
and this can trigger a full-scale war,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   The Duma said it would consider renewing military-technical
cooperation with Yugoslavia in the event of a NATO strike.
	   It called on both sides in the Kosovo conflict to cease fighting
and start peace talks, and appealed to Milosevic to fulfill the
agreement he struck with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow
in June.
	   That agreement called for Yugoslav authorities to provide
security for the civilian population of Kosovo, create conditions
for the return of refugees and prosecute those responsible for
crimes against civilians.
	   Yeltsin called again Friday for a diplomatic solution to the
fighting in a telephone call with Finish President Martti
Ahtisaari, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov discussed the issue by telephone
with U.S, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the French and
Italian foreign ministers, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Ivanov ``reaffirmed Russia's position with regard to the
unacceptability and counterproductiveness of any attempts to use
force in resolving the Kosovo problem,'' said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel closed its borders with the Palestinian
territories on Friday in efforts to prevent what Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said were plans for an ``unprecedented,
horrific'' attack that could set back peace talks.
	   The army was trying to prevent a bombing by the Islamic militant
group Hamas, which could hamper Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on
an Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   Although Israeli officials said the U.S.-brokered talks have
brought some advances toward a deal they hope to conclude in a
four-day summit in Washington in mid-October, the Palestinians
remained skeptical.
	   Hamas has vowed to carry out attacks against Israel after
Israeli soldiers killed two of the group's leaders last month.
	   But Israeli and Palestinian security forces have prevented
bombing attempts in recent weeks by the group whose attacks since
1994 have killed dozens of Israelis.
	   Palestinian police caught two Hamas members with 60 kilos (130
pounds) of explosives in the Gaza Strip a week ago and uncovered a
bomb factory of the group with almost a ton of explosives in the
West Bank city of Hebron, security officials said,
	   Another Hamas member was killed earlier this week when a car he
was in exploded in a West Bank village.
	   As the forces tried to avert attacks, the peace talks were not
getting anywhere, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Friday.
	   Arafat said no great progress had been made in his two meetings
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month in the
United States.
	   ``No substantial progress can be cited,'' the Palestinian leader
said in a speech read at a conference in the West Bank city of
Ramallah by Palestinian International Cooperation Minister Nabil
Shaath.
	   Arafat said he was continuing with plans to declare a
Palestinian state on May 4, 1999, the date when the he says the
interim peace accords will expire.
	   Netanyahu has warned such a move will provoke Israeli
retaliation and possibly an annexation of disputed lands.
	   ``It has been our declaration that we shall declare the exercise
of our soveriegnty of our independent Palestinian state,'' Shaath
said, quoting Arafat's speech.
	   Tensions on the ground continued in Hebron on Friday when seven
Palestinians were injured, one seriously, in clashes with Israeli
soldiers.
	   The Israeli-controlled center of Hebron has been under curfew
since Wednesday when two grenades were thrown at Israeli security
forces, wounding 22 people. Hebron is home to 450 Jewish settlers
and 130,000 Palestinians.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai decided Friday to
seal the West Bank and Gaza indefinitely. The Israeli newspaper
Maariv quoted Mordechai as telling the Israeli Cabinet on Thursday
that ``Hamas wants to carry out a horrific, unprecedented attack in
Israel.''
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the Palestinian
Authority has taken sporadic steps to control Hamas, but ``it's far
short of what we would like.''
	   Fogel warned that an attack would hurt the peace process. In the
past, Israel has suspended talks with the Palestinians after
large-scale attacks by Palestinian extremists.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to arrive in the
Middle East on Tuesday for two days of talks to prepare for a
summit meeting in Washington that Erekat said will take place Oct.

Yeltsin would intervene if new economic program was too strict

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly to
any effort to prohibit Russians from buying foreign currencies,
believing the move would be like bringing another Iron Curtain down
on the country, his spokesman said Friday.
	   ``The president clearly understands that such a ban would be a
clear violation of our rights ... that would mean a return to the
Iron Curtain in everyday life,'' said presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushin.
	   The remarks came after media reports of a government economic
plan in the works that would prohibit Russians from buying U.S.
dollars and other foreign currencies, and institute other strict
economic controls, rolling back seven years of reforms.
	   Though government officials say such a plan is only one of six
possibilities, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Thursday that
he might be forced to take ``unpopular'' measures to rescue the
Russian economy if it does not receive the next installment in a
dlrs 22.6 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and Finance Minister
Mikhail Zadornov flew to Washington on Friday for negotiations with
the IMF over the dlrs 4.3 billion installment.
	   IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to come
up with a sound economic program before the loan is given, and have
made it clear that currency controls and boosting the money supply
by printing rubles are not acceptable.
	   But Primakov said that the country's plan would be dependent on
the IMF loan, not the other way around.
	   No short-term economic plan will be known for another three
weeks, long after the IMF is set to make its decision, said First
Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov.
	   A draft version of the government's fourth-quarter budget would
rely heavily on the IMF loan, the Kommersant newspaper said.
Without the loan, the government would have to engage in major
deficit spending.
	   Calls for Soviet-style controls _ part of the plan drafted by
First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov and leaked to the press
_ have apparently created a rift within the Cabinet. The plan drew
heavy criticism from Zadornov, and Gerashchenko called the idea of
banning foreign currency sales ``a mad idea.''
	   But in an interview Friday, Maslyukov called the leaked plan
``not very fresh fish,'' according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``We are not talking about a program, but about adopting a set
of urgent measures aimed at stabilizing the situation,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's stock market dropped by 5 percent to 38.8
Friday, but trading was so light the downward move meant little.
The stock market has continued to fall since the crisis hit Aug.
17.
	   And tax collection was down in September, the result of the
collapse in Russia's banking system, said Alexander Pochinok, head
of the government's finance and credit department. Revenues totaled
14.3 billion rubles (dlrs 875 million), 700 million rubles (dlrs 43
million) less than expected.
	   The government wants to reverse this trend by raising taxes for
oil and gas companies, but the idea is expected to meet sharp
resistance in the lower house of Russia's parliament, which wants
to cut tax rates, Pochinok said.

threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   But in New York, Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said the
secretary-general declined, saying he was already receiving reports
from U.N. officials in the area.
	   The invitation, carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency,
came after an ethnic Albanian man gave human rights workers a
graphic account of what he said was a Saturday massacre of 13
ethnic Albanian men by Serbian police in a Kosovo forest. Serb
police have denied killing civilians.
	   The Serb invitation came days before Annan is scheduled to
submit a report on compliance with a U.N. Security Council
resolution demanding an end to the Kosovo offensive by Serbian
police and the Yugoslav army. The resolution threatens unspecified
further action if the demand is ignored _ a condition seen by some
NATO countries as opening the door to military intervention.
	   In a separate bid to head off NATO action, the independent Beta
news agency said the Serbs on Friday invited an ethnic Albanian
negotiating team to a meeting as soon as possible to continue the
dialogue that broke down last May. There was no response from the
ethnic Albanian side.
	   On Friday, Serb forces and ethnic Albanians were fighting in
Kosovo just over the Albanian border, said Artan Bizhga, a
spokesman for Albania's interior ministry in the capital, Tirana.
He said Serbs were using heavy artillery in the clash and that some
rounds had landed near an Albanian border police station.
	   Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said Thursday in
Washington that his government is willing to let an international
team take part in an investigation into the massacres to
``establish and prove the facts.''

Three die after attack by rabid bats in Mexico's Copper Canyon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Rabid bats have prompted a health alert in
northern Mexico's scenic Copper Canyon, where three people have
died from bat bites and eight others recently were attacked.
	   A 40-year-old Tarahumara Indian man and his two teen-age sons
died after a group of bats attacked them while they slept in the
village of Batopilas, a popular tourist stop.
	   The deaths occurred two months ago, but Mexico City health
officials could not confirm the cause was rabies-induced
encephalitis until now, newspapers reported Friday.
	   Bats attacked eight other people last month. The victims were
undergoing treatment and have not shown symptoms of rabies,
newspapers reported.
	   An epidemiological team is investigating Copper Canyon, in the
border state of Chihuahua, where thousands of bats live in numerous
caves.

Britain sends more warplanes to Italy; warns against travel in

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain said Friday it will send four more
fighter-bombers to a NATO base in southern Italy as part of the
buildup over Kosovo.
	   Defense Secretary George Robertson said the GR7 Harrier jump
jets will fly Monday from Laarbruch, a British base in Germany, to
Gioia del Colle, bringing the number of Royal Air Force warplanes
there to eight.
	   ``This deployment shows that we mean business and if the
violence does not stop, then Britain will play its full part in
what needs to be done,'' Robertson said.
	   Also Friday, the government warned Britons not to travel to
Yugoslavia, and England canceled a soccer match with Yugoslavia
which was to have been played in London Nov. 18. The English
Football Association said it acted now to end uncertainty over the
fixture.
	   The Foreign Office said Britons in Yugoslavia should consider
leaving now, or be prepared to go at short notice.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair again warned of military reprisals if
attacks against ethnic Albanians _ blamed on Serbs _ continued
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia.
	   ``The objective is the same as the objective throughout, which
is to make him (Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic) stop
committing atrocities and barbarism within Kosovo,'' Blair told
Channel 4 News.
	   ``This is a humanitarian disaster. I believe it will only be
stopped if Milosevic gets the clearest possible message, which is
an unmixed message, namely, if you carry on doing this you will
face a military penalty.''
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels wanting
independence for Kosovo has left hundreds dead and more than
270,000 homeless since it began in February. Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1 in the two million population, is in
southern Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.

Albania: NATO should intervene in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Albania's foreign minister called Friday
for NATO intervention in Kosovo and said Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic should be held accountable for genocide and
investigated for war crimes.
	   Speaking to the U.N. General Assembly, Paskal Milo said
immediate NATO action is necessary ``because of the failure of the
peaceful means applied by the international community so far.''
	   ``It is high time for the U.N. and other international
organizations to urgently intervene for the restoration of peace,
otherwise we risk to have another wider conflict,'' he warned.
	   Milo accused Milosevic of ordering ``the implementation of his
ethnic cleansing policy against Albanians under the pretext of
combating the so-called Albanian terrorism.''
	   The Albanian government urged the prosecutor of the
International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia ``to start
the investigation for the indictment of Milosevic as a war
criminal,'' the minister said.
	   A crackdown by Serb security forces on ethnic Albanian
separatists in the southern Serb province has left hundreds dead
and more than 270,000 homeless since it began in February. Serbia,
the dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation, accuses Albania
of backing the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army and supplying them
with arms.
	   Milo said thousands of Kosovo Albanians have fled to Albania and
thousands more were wandering Kosovo's forests and mountains,
creating an acute humanitarian crisis.
	   The U.N. Security Council on Thursday condemned recent massacres
of ethnic Albanians, but did not assign blame and added no new
legal backing for any NATO action. It demanded compliance with
resolutions calling for the immediate withdrawal of special Serb
police forces sent to Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians, who comprise
90 percent of the province, are seeking independence.
	   In his speech, Milo accused Serbian propaganda of trying to
justify indiscriminate attacks and the massacre of ethnic Albanians
_ just as it did in Bosnia _ by making false accusations of
terrorist activity.
	   ``The Albanian government strongly condemns this policy and
openly declares that Milosevic should be taken accountable and
responsible for genocide,'' he said.
	   Milo insisted that Albania wants a peaceful end to the Kosovo
conflict.
	   ``We are in favor of an immediate end of the conflict and the
initiation of the negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina, with
an international involvement as a third party,'' Milo said. ``This
would guarantee their success. The negotiations should define the
future status of Kosovo.''
	   The Albanian government believes a solution ``should take into
consideration the respect of the will of the Albanians to
self-determination and the respect for the international
conventions which reject the violent changing of borders,'' he
said.
	   On domestic matters, Milo said the Albanian government was
``working diligently'' to establish the long-term rule of law after
months of unrest. Albania is still trying to recover from
nationwide riots that exploded in 1997 after pyramid investment
schemes collapsed, depriving many Albanians of their life savings.
	   Milo expressed hope that the Albanian people will be able to
vote on a proposed draft constitution, which recognizes the need to
share political power and secure human rights, by the end of the
year.
	   The adoption of a constitution _ ratified by the people _ that
recognizes ``the fundamental rule of law and protects liberties,''
offers the best hope for the future of Albania, Milo said.

World Cup hero Jacquet to quit soccer after current post
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Aime Jacquet, who coached France to
World Cup glory, said Friday he will retire from soccer when he
leaves his current post as technical director of the French
Football Federation.
	   In an interview with regional newspaper La Tribune-Le Progres,
Jacquet said that he received offers to take over several top
European clubs before his World Cup success _ ``and even more
afterwards.''
	   But he said his coaching days were behind him.
	   ``I turned them down without entering into discussions,''
Jacquet was quoted as saying.
	   Jacquet will spend this weekend celebrating the World Cup win in
Sail-sous-Couzan, a village of just over 1,000 people in south
eastern France where he grew up.
	   About 20,000 people are expected to pay homage to Jacquet.
	   France won the World Cup for the first time in its history on
July 12, beating Brazil 3-0.

Nobel committee picks peace prize winner, choice remains secret
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The Norwegian awards committee knows who
will win the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize after a final meeting Friday,
but in keeping with tradition of secrecy will say nothing until the
official announcement Oct. 16.
	   The Oslo-based committee sifted through a record 139 nominations
this year, including 114 individuals and 25 organizations.
	   Geir Lundestad, the committee's nonvoting secretary, said a
decision has been made but, as usual, would not give the slightest
him.
	   ``We have reached a conclusion. Now we will use the days
remaining to polish the citation,'' Lundestad was quoted as telling
the Norwegian news agency NTB.
	   No clear favorites have emerged for the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize,
which includes a dlrs 975,000 cash award. NTB, an avid Nobel
watcher, said the winner could be linked to Northern Ireland peace
process or a human rights activist, such as Czech President Vaclav
Havel, in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the U.N. Human
Rights Charter.
	   The five-member awards committee refuses to release the names of
candidates, partly to protect some of them from persecution.
	   However, sometimes those making nominations announce them.
	   Such known candidates this year include Havel; U.S. President
Bill Clinton and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter for
wide-ranging peace efforts; Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. official
who brokered the 1995 accord that brought an end to Bosnia's
fighting; and, Pope John Paul II, as a symbol of peace.
	   Others include Chinese prodemocracy campaigners Wei Jingsheng
and Wang Dan, the Salvation Army, the humanitarian group Doctors
without Borders, and Kurdish lawmaker Leyla Zana, who is jailed in
Turkey.
	   The awards committee often uses the prize to encourage difficult
peace efforts, such as in the Middle East and South Africa.
	   While the Northern Ireland peace process could also use a nudge
forward, so many people were involved, including British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, Irish President Bertie Ahern, U.S. peace
mediator George Mitchell and many others, deciding whom to honor
would be a daunting task for the committee.
	   The Nobel Prizes are always presented on the Dec. 10 anniversary
of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swede who invented dynamite and
endowed the Nobel Prizes. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, and
the other Nobel prize in Stockholm, Sweden.

Jamaica sends soldiers, materials to help hurricane relief effort
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica has sent soldiers, electrical
workers and emergency supplies to Antigua and St. Kitts and Nevis
to help the recovery from Hurricane Georges.
	   Fifteen Jamaica Defense Force soldiers skilled in carpentry,
plumbing, electrical engineering, medical technology and other
essential areas were sent Friday to St. Kitts, the government
announced.
	   They bring to 24 the total of soldiers sent to the small,
eastern Caribbean islands first hit by Georges as it plowed through
the region, killing more than 400 people.
	   The Jamaica Public Service Co. Ltd. also sent a 17-member team
of linesmen and supervisory personnel to help Antigua restore
electric service.
	   Medical supplies, plastic sheeting and bedding have also been
sent, government officials said.

Divisions showing in Slovak opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ One of four opposition parties that
won a majority in parliament announced Friday it would not enter a
coalition with one of the other parties, marking the first division
among the group.
	   Prior to elections and immediately afterward, the four parties
informally agreed to form a coalition. But the Democratic Left of
former Communists changed tack Friday, saying it would not enter
into a coalition that includes the Hungarian Coalition party.
	   ``We think that it would be better for the Slovak citizens if
the three opposition parties formed the ruling coalition without
the Hungarian Party,'' independent radio Twist quoted party
chairman Jozef Migas as saying Friday. He did not comment on why
his party changed its mind.
	   All told, the four opposition parties won 93 seats, a
constitutional majority in the new parliament elected in balloting
held last weekend. The Democratic Left is the second strongest
party in the informal opposition alliance, with 23 seats in the new
parliament.
	   Bela Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian Coalition Party, which
represents Slovakia's 550,000 ethnic Hungarians, threatened to be a
strong opposition to the others three parties if left out of the
coalition.
	   ``This is a historic opportunity for Slovakia to have Hungarians
in the government,'' Bugar told reporters at a news conference.
``If we are not going to be included in the government, we are
going to be a strong opposition to the ruling parties.''
	   But without the Hungarians, the opposition coalition would hold
only 78 seats in the 150-seat Slovak Parliament, far short of the
90 votes needed to make changes to the constitution.
	   The two remaining opposition parties, including the largest
Slovak Democratic Coalition, reiterated Friday their continued
desire to form a coalition of all four opposition parties.
	   On Wednesday, the opposition parties greeted Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar's announcement that he would resign within a month.
Meciar has ruled Slovakia for virtually its entire six years of
independence. It was his authoritarian practices that drove the
opposition to join forces in the first place, vowing to never
forget ``Meciarism.''
	   The Democratic Left are to meet with the Slovak Democratic
Coalition to begin talking about a coalition agreement next
Tuesday.

Faced by breakaway Super League, UEFA outlines improved Champions
</HEADLINE>
Cup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A UEFA Task Force announced Friday a new format
it's considering for the European Champions Cup to counter the
launch of a breakaway independent Super League.
	   Following 3 1/2 hours of meetings with several of Europe's
biggest clubs, the European Football 2000 Task Force projected
600-800 million Swiss francs (dlrs 440-590 million) in total prize
money for the new format.
	   ``The winners have the possibility to win between 60-80 million
Swiss francs,'' UEFA general secretary Gerhard Aigner said in an
impromptu press conference following the meeting.
	   ``It depends of the format the executive committee chooses next
week at meetings in Lisbon.''
	   UEFA proposed two different formats for the new and improved
Champions Cup with 24- and 32-team versions. The Task Force also
proposed to merge the UEFA Cup and the Cup Winners Cup into one
competition.
	   The proposals are in retaliation to a Super League conceived by
a Milan-based marketing firm, Media Partners, which is currently
attempting to lure some of the biggest names in European soccer
including Bayern Munich, Ajax, Inter and AC Milan, Manchester
United and Arsenal, with a reported 1.2 billion dollar pot.

Russia won't face bread shortages despite poor grain harvest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ There will be no bread shortage in Russia this
year even though the country is expected to have its worst grain
harvest in decades, a news agency reported Friday.
	   The country's bread needs will be fulfilled with the help of
grain reserves from 1997, said Alexander Bondarenko, deputy head of
the Agricultural Ministry's department for food and processing
industries, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   About 20 million metric tons (22 million tons) of grain will go
toward bread production, and the rest will be used in macaroni and
flour production, Bondarenko said.
	   Agricultural officials have already said they expect to harvest
only 56 million metric tons (62 million tons) of grain this year,
the lowest since the 54.9 million-metric-ton (60.5 million-ton)
harvest of 1957.
	   The ministry blamed the poor production partly on late September
rains. Many regions are still harvesting their crops, even as snow
is beginning to blanket portions of the country.

Federation asks government to reverse its suspension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's soccer federation, suspended
by the government from running the sport over a doping issue,
demanded Friday that the ban to be lifted.
	   The Bulgarian Football Union said that Neftochimik forward Ilia
Gruev, who had tested positive for banned substances in April,
already has been suspended from the national championship for three
months.
	   ``We consider that the Bulgarian Football Union has fulfilled
its obligations ... which gives sufficient ground for its license
to be restored,'' read a statement carried by the state news agency
BTA.
	   There was no immediate response from the government.
	   The government Sports Committee, which is empowered to license
teams and sports organizations, banned the BFU in September from
administering the sport, saying it failed to comply with domestic
and international law on doping in Gruev's case.
	   FIFA warned last week that Bulgaria may be suspended from all
international competitions because of the ban.
	   Pushed by lawmakers on Wednesday, Committee and BFU officials
agreed to negotiate a deal to reverse the ban in exchange for
Gruev's punishment.

New elections to be held in strife-torn Lesotho
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with election announcement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ This mountainous kingdom will hold new
elections within 18 months, South Africa's deputy president
announced Friday after his country mediated talks between Lesotho's
government and opposition parties.
	   The current government, elected last May in a vote opposition
groups claim were rigged, will stay in power until the elections
are held 15 to 18 months from now, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
said in a televised address.
	   The announcement came at the end of a day of talks _ mediated in
Lesotho by officials from South Africa and three other countries _
between the country's ruling party and opposition groups to try to
resolve the turmoil that led to South Africa's military
intervention last week.
	   Mbeki said all parties had agreed to new elections, which would
be held after the small nation's electoral commission is
``strengthened.''
	   About 1,000 opposition supporters gathered outside King Letsie
III's palace while the talks were held at United Nations offices
down the road. Intervention troops from South Africa and Botswana _
who arrived in this mountainous kingdom last week to quell an army
mutiny and a series of strikes _ warily looked on.
	   Mediating Friday's talks were South African Security Minister
Sydney Mufamadi and representatives from Zimbabwe, Botswana and
Mozambique, said South African government spokesman Ricky Naidoo.
	   The turmoil in this Belgium-sized country of 2 million _ which
is surrounded by South Africa _ stems from the May elections, which
the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy won by a landslide.
Opposition parties claim the voting was rigged.
	   A regional commission found irregularities in the voting but not
enough to warrant overturning the result.
	   Refuting claims that 58 of its soldiers had died in the
intervention, the
	   Lesotho Defense Force asserted in a statement Friday that 18
were killed and
	   nine injured. Nine South African soldiers have also been killed,
according to official figures.
	   The South African Council of Churches, meanwhile, said South
Africa and the Southern African Development Community should accept
responsibility for a looting and arson spree that erupted when the
intervention _ launched on behalf of SADC _ began on Sept. 22.
	   Neighboring countries should help rebuild Lesotho, which has
suffered an estimated 2 billion rands (dlrs 350 million) in damage
during the intervention, the church group said.
	   Taking a step in that direction, South Africa's National Union
of Mineworkers said Friday it would set up a fund to help rebuild
essential services. Between 80,000 and 90,000 people from Lesotho
work in South Africa's mines, their wages generating most of the
income of this impoverished land-locked nation.

	   Raising Pizza
	   MADERA, California (AP) _ It's an unconventional farm by any
measure _ a circular plot of land, sliced into eight sections, each
with farm produce or animals that end up as different ingredients
in a pizza.
	   Children love it. They also learn a few things.
	   ``Some of them really thought that pizzas grew on trees or
slices sprouted up from the ground,'' said Darren Schmall, who
founded the Pizza Farm six years ago. ``Some thought pigs lay
sausage links.''
	   In Schmall's world, pizzas do come from trees and sprout from
the ground, but only as ingredients. And he's committed his small
plot at the Madera County Fairgrounds to making sure children know
that fact.
	   The Pizza Farm's slices are laden with olive trees, tomato
plants, peppers, wheat, herbs, pigs, dairy cows and cows for meat.
Chickens and turkeys are kept in a separate shed.
	   And now the idea is catching on _ it's being duplicated in at
least three places in the United States, and Schmall says he
receives e-mail from farmers and educators worldwide who want to
start their own.
	   ``I started it because I wanted the kids to understand
agriculture and know how important San Joaquin Valley is,'' said
Schmall, 33. ``People don't realize that this area is the No. 1
agriculture area in the world. ... And we want them to know that
their food comes from farms, not grocery stores.''
	   But why pizza?
	   ``Knowing all kids love pizza, we explain to them that without
farmers, they wouldn't have their favorite food,'' he said.
	   About 10,000 children, from preschoolers to 6th graders, visit
each year, mostly on field trips. A one-hour guided tour includes a
talk about agriculture and how each crop or animal is grown.
Afterwards, the children get to see the animals and produce _ and
eat pizza.
	   ``We just ate a pig, a cow and a chicken,'' said grinning
9-year-old Stephanie Whitfield while finishing her pizza slice.

	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ A fiery explosion blew apart a car in a
crowded quarter of Naples on Friday, injuring about 20 people.
Authorities suspected a car bomb planted by one of the city's
warring crime clans.
	   Three of the injured were reported in grave condition.
	   The blast and the resulting fire blew out windows in surrounding
homes and blackened pavement and buildings in the narrow street. At
least five other cars were destroyed.
	   The blast occurred in an area where two clans of the Camorra
crime syndicate are fighting for control.

Dominicans look for answers in hurricane mishaps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Shell-shocked from
Hurricane Georges, thousands of Dominicans panicked when a rumor
spread this week that a tidal wave was barreling towards the
Caribbean country's shores.
	   Ignoring civil defense officials who said there was nothing to
fear, they jumped from their beds early Thursday in Santo Domingo
and other coastal areas and headed for higher ground. They soon
filed back home, bleary-eyed and embarrassed, but glad to be alive.
	   The scare revealed Dominicans' mistrust of their government,
which many blame for inadequate warning about the deadly Hurricane
Georges.
	   ``People pay more attention to the word on the street than what
the authorities are telling them,'' said Ruddy Gonzalez, director
of the daily newspaper Ultima Hora.
	   The storm killed at least 249 here and left at least 100,000
homeless.
	   Across the Caribbean, Georges killed at least 412 people last
week.
	   Critics, including Roman Catholic Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus
Lopez Rodriguez, say the tragedy could have been lessened if
officials _ particularly the civil defense chief, Elpidio Baez, and
the weather service director, Felix Abel Abreu _ had given more
warning about Georges' arrival and moved people into shelters
sooner.
	   Government meteorologists said they presented dire forecasts at
a meeting with disaster officials three days before the hurricane
hit. They claimed that Baez and Abreu ordered the reports toned
down and delayed because they didn't want to create a panic.
	   ``We would have preferred to alarm the population than to have
the situation we have now,'' chief meteorologist Mercedes Mejia
told The Associated Press.
	   Mejia, who was using satellite data and forecasts from the U.S.
National Hurricane Center in Miami, said she was finally allowed to
issue an alert for certain areas the morning of Sept. 21 _ less
than 24 hours before Georges hit.
	   The warning, made more menacing later that day, predicted
``torrential rains'' and ``strong winds'' and urged people to obey
civil defense officials.
	   It was unclear, however, how many Dominicans _ most of whom get
their news by radio and television _ got the message, or how many
got it in time.
	   Newspapers printed the warnings in their Sept. 22 editions, and
President Leonel Fernandez gave a radio and television address
early that afternoon. By that time, however, the hurricane had
already pummeled half of the country and caused widespread
blackouts.
	   The toughest criticism has been of Baez, a political appointee
from the ruling Dominican Liberation Party who was named civil
defense chief a month before the hurricane hit.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Baez denied the many
charges against him: that he suppressed meteorological data, failed
to announce where shelters were and then opened them too late, and
was passive about evacuating people from the most vulnerable areas.
	   ``I said the country had to prepare itself for the worst,'' Baez
insisted, adding that many Dominicans simply chose not to listen.
	   ``People in this country are not afraid of hurricanes, '' Baez
said. ``They believe the hurricanes are never going to arrive.''
	   Indeed, with a recent history of near-misses _ the last
hurricane to do major damage here was Hurricane David in 1979 _
Dominicans may have developed a false sense of security.
	   In San Juan de la Maguana, a town 75 miles (125 kilometers) west
of Santo Domingo where the Red Cross reported 76 dead, the
government says poor residents not wanting to part with their
possessions hurled rocks at civil defense workers trying to
evacuate them.
	   The government also denies it released water to ease pressure on
a dam upstream, accidentally helping to bury parts of the town
under raging floodwaters.
	   As he picked through the debris of his mud-flattened house
earlier this week, San Juan de la Maguana resident Alberto Calderon
said he and his shantytown neighbors just didn't take the
government seriously.
	   ``We were advised, but we didn't know it would be like this,''
he said.

<TEXT>
	   GRENOBLE, France (AP) _ A small lock of gray hair belonging to
King Louis XVI will be auctioned on Saturday, 205 years after the
monarch was beheaded during the French Revolution.
	   The hair, in an ornate frame dating from the same era, is
expected to fetch at least 20,000 francs (dlrs 3,333), antique
experts say.
	   Certificates on the back of the frame say the hair was cut off
just moments after the king was beheaded on Jan. 21, 1793 at Place
de la Concorde in central Paris.
	   A drummer near the scaffold was said to have cut off several
locks after trapping the king's head with his foot. He later
distributed them among the king's supporters.
	   Bidding will begin at at around 5,000 francs (dlrs 830),
auctioneer Jean Pierre Bouvier said, valuing the lock at 8,000
francs (dlrs 1,333).
	   Experts said bidding would go far higher.
	   ``It's a rare piece, worth more than 20,000 francs,'' said local
antiques expert Roland Del-Balzo, adding that he had already heard
of such offers being planned.
	   No forensic tests have been conducted to prove the hair belonged
to the monarch. But Del-Balzo said the family selling it had the
certificates to prove it.
	   The family, from Grenoble, has requested they not be identified.
	   Del-Balzo said the value is enhanced by the two certificates on
the frame detailing two previous sales of the lock of hair _ in
1810 and 1880.
	   King Louis XVI lived from 1754 to 1793.
	   The auction takes place Saturday afternoon at the Clarine du
Fontanil hotel, in Fontanil, near Grenoble.

Germany poised to win individual dressage, after claiming gold in
</HEADLINE>
team event &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Germany's Isabel Werth led the individual dressage
at the World Equestrian Games Friday, a day after helping her team
secure the championships' first gold in the team dressage.
	   The 1996 Olympic Champion in individual and team dressage, Werth
finished second in Friday's Grand Prix Special but managed to stay
atop the event standings with a total of 157.15 points.
	   The Netherland's Anky Van Grunsven put in an exceptional
performance on her bay Gestion Bonfire to win the Special.
Grunsven, the Olympic silver medalist, is less than one point
behind Werth, who rides chestnut Nissan Gigolo.
	   The individual dressage concludes Sunday with the Free Style
event.
	   On Thursday, Germany won the team dressage title, with the
silver going to the Netherlands and the bronze to Sweden. The
United States was fourth.
	   ``Our riders did really, really well,'' said Jessica
Ransehausen, chef de mission for the American team. ``We were
fourth by a very small margin.''
	   Germany showed its strength again Friday in the three-day event
when Bettina Overesch on grey Watermill Stream took over the lead
from New Zealand's Mark Todd, a former Olympic champion.
	   Todd rode Thursday and scored 34 points on Broadcast News,
compared to Overesch's 33.6.
	   The defending three-day event champion, Vaughn Jefferis of New
Zealand, put in a mediocre performance to finish 18th.
	   David O'Connor, on Giltedge, scored the U.S. team's best result
to finish fourth with 40.6 points. The three other American riders
finished 20th, 24th and 30th.
	   ``Our horses and riders look good,'' said Jim Wolf, the director
of the U.S. three-day event team. ``Any of six nations could win,
so we need a bit of luck.''
	   At the Atlanta Olympics, the Americans claimed the silver in the
discipline while New Zealand took the bronze. Australia won.
	   The three-day event continues Saturday with the speed and
endurance tests, followed by the final test of show jumping Sunday.
	   About 700 horses and 550 riders and drivers from 42 countries
will compete in the championships, held at three separate sites,
which run through Oct. 11. Eleven titles will be assigned in five
disciplines, including the Olympic events of dressage,
three-day-event and jumping.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel closed its borders with the Palestinian
territories Friday in an effort to prevent what Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said were plans for an ``unprecedented,
horrific'' attack that could set back peace talks.
	   The army was trying to prevent a bombing by the Islamic militant
group Hamas, which could hamper Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on
an Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   Although Israeli officials said the U.S.-brokered talks have
progressed toward a deal they hope to conclude in a four-day
October summit in Washington, the Palestinians remained skeptical.
	   Hamas has vowed to carry out attacks against Israel after
Israeli soldiers killed two of the group's leaders last month.
	   But Israeli and Palestinian security forces have prevented
bombing attempts in recent weeks by the group, whose attacks since
1994 have killed dozens of Israelis.
	   Palestinian police caught two Hamas members with 130 pounds (60
kilos) of explosives in the Gaza Strip a week ago and uncovered a
Hamas bomb factory with almost a ton of explosives in the West Bank
city of Hebron, security officials said.
	   Another Hamas member was killed earlier this week when a
bomb-laden car, apparently intended for an attack on Israelis,
exploded in a West Bank village.
	   While Palestinian police worked to avert attacks, the peace
talks were getting nowhere, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said
Friday.
	   No real progress was made in his two meetings with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the United States this week, Arafat
said.
	   ``No substantial progress can be cited,'' Arafat said in a
speech read at a conference in the West Bank city of Ramallah by
Palestinian International Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath.
	   Arafat said he was continuing with plans to declare a
Palestinian state on May 4, 1999, the date the Palestinians say the
interim peace accords expire.
	   Netanyahu has warned such a move will provoke Israeli
retaliation and possibly an annexation of disputed lands.
	   ``We shall declare the exercise of our sovereignty of our
independent Palestinian state,'' Shaath said, quoting Arafat's
speech.
	   Tensions on the ground continued Friday in Hebron when seven
Palestinians were injured, one seriously, in clashes with Israeli
soldiers.
	   The Israeli-controlled center of Hebron has been under curfew
since Wednesday, when two grenades were thrown at Israeli security
forces, wounding 22 people. Hebron is home to 450 Jewish settlers
and 130,000 Palestinians.
	   Mordechai, the Israeli defense minister, announced Friday that
the West Bank and Gaza Strip would be sealed indefinitely. The
Israeli newspaper Maariv quoted Mordechai as telling the Israeli
Cabinet on Thursday that ``Hamas wants to carry out a horrific,
unprecedented attack in Israel.''
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the Palestinian
Authority has taken sporadic steps to control Hamas, but ``it's far
short of what we would like.''
	   Fogel warned that an attack would hurt the peace process. In the
past, Israel has suspended talks with the Palestinians after
large-scale attacks by Palestinian militants.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to arrive Tuesday in
the Middle East for two days of talks to prepare for a summit
meeting in Washington that Erekat said will take place Oct. 15-19.

First lady draws inspiration from women around the world
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with new details, recasts &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, cheered by
women in Latin America as a source of inspiration, says the women
she meets on her world travels are the ones who inspire her.
	   ``I am very grateful for the opportunity that I have to meet
with women and to listen to them, their dreams, their aspirations,
their hopes, their concerns,'' Mrs. Clinton told the Vital Voices
of the Americas Conference, a U.S. foreign policy project aimed at
helping women advance politically and economically.
	   ``And I'm always amazed, impressed and humbled by the
extraordinary human spirit and hopefulness that I find.
	   ``Whether I'm in a very poor village in Bangladesh or Uganda, or
in a very small business in Nicaragua or Santiago, I'm always with
women who inspire me.''
	   The voices of women throughout the hemisphere must be heard, she
said, ``in city halls and boardrooms and trade union offices, in
political parties, in academia, in families.''
	   Mrs. Clinton, on the final day of her four-day trip to Puerto
Rico and South America, struck many of the themes she has
emphasized before _ in Santiago, Chile, where she addressed her
fellow first ladies of the Americas; on Thursday, when speaking to
the multiparty Uruguayan Women's Political Network; in the six
years she has lived in the White House and even long before then.
	   She emphasized anew the need for women's full participation in
the political and economic lives of their countries as well as the
need for judicial systems to treat women fairly. So-called women's
issues, she said, are really society's issues _ domestic violence,
for example, is not a women's problem but a crime.
	   Hattie Babbitt, the deputy administrator for the Agency for
International Development, said Friday in an interview that she's
been hearing her friend argue these cases for more than two
decades. After Mrs. Clinton delivered her stirring speech Thursday
to the Uruguayan Women's Political Network, Babbitt told her: ``You
know, you gave that speech in 1974.''
	   Women at the conference said they were moved that Mrs. Clinton
had come to Montevideo.
	   Gladys Aida Caballero, the vice president of Honduras, said in
an interview that she has high hopes for Mrs. Clinton's future.
	   ``I'd like her to be the first woman president of the United
States,'' said Ms. Caballero, who like Mrs. Clinton is a lawyer.
``I think it's the time for a lady like her to be president. She
has all the qualifications you need.''
	   Eugenia Charles, the former prime minister of Dominica, said in
an interview, ``She's interested in the right things, not just in
being a first lady. She wants to improve things. She's not
satisfied by the status quo.''
	   Mrs. Clinton announced new U.S. government programs Friday
directed largely at women. The initiatives include dlrs 50 million
from the U.S. Agency for International Development to strengthen
human rights, justice and democracy. AID will also increase its
loans to small enterprises in the hemisphere to dlrs 120 million
over the next three years, more than two-thirds of the loans going
to women.
	   Mrs. Clinton was flying back to Washington Friday.

Election results certified, moderates won more power despite
</HEADLINE>
Poplasen's victory
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Although nationwide
elections produced less change than hoped, the election results
certified Friday have increased the power of moderates.
	   Election supervisors announced the official results and the
allocation of seats for the legislative bodies in voting that took
place three weeks ago.
	   ``Pluralism has won today,'' said U.S. Ambassador Robert Barry,
the head of the Bosnian branch of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe charged with organizing and supervising the
elections.
	   Parties considered moderate for the most part won at all levels,
apart from the disappointing victory of ultra-nationalist Nikola
Poplasen over moderate Biljana Plavsic for president of the Bosnian
Serb half of the country.
	   Under the Bosnian peace agreement negotiated in Dayton, Ohio, in
1995 Bosnia was divided into two halves _ the Bosnian Serb republic
and the Muslim-Croat Federation. Both have their own parliaments,
governments and presidents. The entities are loosely linked by a
joint presidency, parliament and government.
	   Previously, hard-line nationalist parties, seeking the division
of the country had the majority and blocked the peace process,
forcing international officials on the ground to impose solutions.
	   Barry believes the elections will entail authorities who are
``more responsive to the will of the people.''
	   He said the message of the voters to their leaders was: ``Get on
with the issues that are a concern to us, act responsibly, make
decisions for yourselves and don't wait for the international
community to make them for you!''
	   For the first time, some minority parties are represented in
parliaments of the country.
	   The Serb National Assembly may play a key role in the future,
since it can approve or reject Poplasen's proposals for a premier
in case he offers a hard-liner like himself.
	   It was important that ``nobody in that parliament has a blocking
majority as was the case in the past,'' Barry said. Pro-Dayton
forces have won more seats over hard-liners on all levels.
	   With the general elections certified, international institutions
in Bosnia will move over to the harder part - the implementation of
results and monitoring the work of the new authorities.
	   ``We expect those parties which have won mandates from the
electorate to respect democratic principles in forming executive
bodies,'' Barry said.

Hingis retires in semifinal match against fellow Swiss
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ As she prepares to defend her No. 1
ranking from the assault of Lindsay Davenport, Martina Hingis has
to worry about her fitness.
	   After blowing a 5-1 lead and a match point in the third set
against her fellow Swiss teen-ager Patty Schnyder, Hingis retired
at 5-5 after suffering cramps in the Grand Slam Cup semifinal.
	   ``I have to get into a better shape,'' Hingis said.
	   The first official showdown between the two teammates had lasted
two hours and 11 minutes by the time Hingis retired. Hingis won the
first set 7-5, Schnyder took the second, also 7-5.
	   ``I haven't had enough time to recover since the U.S. Open, but
I also have to work on my fitness,'' said Hingis, who turned 18 on
Wednesday.
	   ``If you have certain assets, if you know that you can win with
these assets without going to your workout studio all the time, you
tend to neglect your workout studio,'' she said.
	   ``Usually I try to have the others players move around the court
without moving myself too much,'' Hingis said.
	   Schnyder, 19, made Hingis run a lot and felt she could have won
the match anyway.
	   ``I think I would have won those two games, but it's true, she
retired and I didn't really win it,'' Schnyder said.
	   ``In a regular tournament or in a Grand Slam, she would have
played those last two games, even at the risk of a major injury,''
Schnyder said. ``But this is not a tournament where you can win
points and she's got a few tournaments coming up where she has to
defend her No. 1 position.''
	   Hingis admitted as much. ``Why continue? I would have had no
chance anyway.''
	   ``I didn't want to suffer more, to get a worse injury,'' she
said. ``I still want to play the next two tournaments.''
	   The first is next week in Filderstadt, Germany, where Davenport
can seize the top ranking. Davenport lost her opening match here,
against Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Hingis also suffered cramps in a match against Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario in the Fed Cup final two weeks ago. Although she
won that match, Spain beat Switzerland for the title.
	   After winning three of the four Grand Slam tournaments last year
(Australian Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open) and reaching the final
of the French Open, Hingis captured only one this year _ the first
one in Australia.
	   Since then, Hingis has won only three more titles, at Indian
Wells, Hamburg and Rome, and she lost the U.S. Open final to
Davenport, her third loss to the American this year.
	   In men's quarterfinals, Andre Agassi rallied to beat Petr Korda
4-6, 6-0, 6-1.
	   Korda, the Australian Open champion, was the only men's Grand
Slam winner in the tournament that nominally brings together
players with best records at the four events.
	   Agassi, a wild card, dropped his serve to lose the first set but
then went on a roll, winning the next eight games.
	   ``I just got the momentum and I kept it,'' Agassi said.
	   Korda's double-fault at match point was typical of his
performance: 16 double-faults and 39 unforced errors.
	   While the first set lasted 37 minutes, Agassi needed only 47 for
the next two. He won his opening match against Cedric Pioline in a
tournament-record 43 minutes.
	   ``I drank too much coffee, I had too much energy,'' he said.
	   Although there are no ranking points to be earned at the dlrs
6.7 million tournament, there is plenty of money to compensate.
	   Schnyder earned dlrs 400,000 _ and could double that for winning
the title.
	   Hingis got dlrs 200,000, plus a dlrs 100,000 bonus for her
Australian Open title.
	   Korda, winner here in 1993, received a bye into the
quarterfinals and for one match made a total of dlrs 300,000 _
including a dlrs 125,000 bonus for his Australian Open title.
	   Agassi got dlrs 325,000 for reaching the semifinals. The men's
winner will earn dlrs 1.3 million.

Beirut film festival opens with more than 50 films
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZEINA KARAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ An award-wining look at Lebanon's 15-year
civil war opened Beirut's international film festival on Friday,
kicking off a week of other movies about conflicts around the
world.
	   Organizers say the festival, in its second year, encourages
international productions with Lebanon, whose movie industry is
small.
	   The weeklong festival features more than 50 international, Arab,
Iranian and Lebanese films, including ``Welcome to Sarajevo'' by
American director Michael Winterbottom.
	   The film _ a collection of true stories of the 1992-95 Bosnian
civil war _ is about a journalist and his feeling of powerlessness.
It is also about his attempts to strike a balance between his job
and his desire to help war victims.
	   War is also the theme of other Lebanese films, particularly
student entries, that highlight the horrors of the 1975-90 civil
war that claimed 150,000 lives.
	   The tragedy is depicted best in Friday's show of ``West
Beirut,'' a French-Lebanese co-production that won its director,
Lebanese Ziad Doueiri of Lebanon, the Rothman's World Film
International Critics Award for first-time film-makers at the
Toronto Film Festival and two awards at Cannes.
	   ``West Beirut'' sees Lebanon's violence through the eyes of
Muslim teenagers Tarek and his friend Omar and their Christian
neighbor May.
	   Tarek is more than happy when school shuts down on April 13,
1975 _ the day civil war broke out. But as Beirut slips into
anarchy, Tarek finds himself wishing classes would resume.
	   Among other prominent movies that will be screened is ``Train to
Pakistan'' by Pamela Rooks, a screen adaptation of a novel by
Indian author Khushwant Singh.
	   The story is set in 1947 during the partition of the former
British colonial India into a predominantly Hindu India and an
Islamic Pakistan. The event led to one of the worst religious
carnages in history among Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs.
	   A notable Arab film is ``Keswa _ The Lost Thread,'' in which
Tunisian director Kalthoum Bornaz tells the tale of a young woman
who had escaped her traditional destiny by eloping with the man she
loves.
	   Renowned Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami's award-winning
``Taste of Cherry'' tackles the issue of suicide, a taboo subject
in Iran where the government has controlled filmmaking since the
1979 Islamic Revolution.
	   Awards will be given in six categories: international features,
Arab features, Lebanese feature films, Lebanese short films,
Lebanese documentaries and Lebanese student films.

Belarus fulfilling obligations despite profit loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarus is fulfilling its obligations to
get rid of its weapons stockpiles even though it is losing
potential income in the process, a Belarusian official said Friday.
	   Belarus has dismantled more than 3,000 tanks, as well as 150
warplanes and helicopters, as part of world disarmament agreements,
said Prime Minister Sergei Ling.
	   Ling said that for each tank Belarus could have fetched up to
dlrs 48,000.
	   ``However, we have not traded, and got rid of our nuclear
weapons,'' he said.
	   Belarus, which gave up the nuclear weapons it inherited from the
Soviet Union in 1996, has been hit hard by Russia's latest
financial crisis, and like Russia, is desperately in need of hard
cash.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Turkish, Macedonian presidents adopting joint
declaration on Kosovo, quotes from press conference

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ The presidents of Turkey and Macedonia
adopted Friday a joint declaration on Kosovo, calling for an
immediate solution to the crisis by peaceful means and preservation
of Yugoslavia's territorial integrity.
	   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel arrived Friday on a two-day
visit to boost relations with this former Yugoslav republic and
discuss the situation in strife-torn Kosovo.
	   After meeting his host, Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov, the
two men signed a joint declaration on Kosovo, expressing deep
concern that the conflict in neighboring Yugoslavia's province
could jeopardize peace and stability in the entire Balkans.
	   Demirel and Gligorov gave support to the last U.N. resolution on
Kosovo and called for coordinated efforts of the international
community to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe in the province.
	   Both pledged their countries readiness to help with these
efforts.
	   The declaration said , ``Meaningful negotiations between
Yugoslav authorities and Kosovo Albanians should start
immediately.''
	   ``Kosovo should gain such a status in the framework of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, based on democracy, pluralism and
respect of human rights,'' it said.
	   Asked at a news conference later whether Turkey would
participate in NATO airstrikes in Kosovo, Demirel simply answered:
``Yes,'' but expressed hope that a military intervention would not
be necessary.
	   ``Turkey is a member of the U.N. and NATO,'' Demirel said.
``Yugoslavia should obey the U.N. Security Council resolution,'' he
added.
	   Gligorov told reporters that if Macedonia were asked to
participate in a NATO intervention in Kosovo, then, `` the
Macedonian government will make a decision.''
	   Macedonia has its own restive ethnic Albanian minority and could
be affected by the fighting between Serb forces and separatist
ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Three people were wounded Friday after an armed man
burst into a church in south east Paris during a Gypsy wedding,
firing shots at the congregation.
	   The incident occurred at the Notre-Dame-du-Rosaire church late
Friday afternoon.
	   All three of the casualties were hospitalized, police said, one
with a gunshot wound, and the other two with knife wounds. The man
who was shot was in a serious condition having been hit in the
thorax, police said.

scene, stabbed the two men in the ensuing melee.
	   Police said two people were detained for questioning.

Serbs show evidence of withdrawal, ethnic Albanians say all is

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With the clock ticking down to
possible NATO airstrikes, Serb authorities scrambled Friday to show
they are complying with U.N. demands to pull back their forces and
bring peace to Kosovo.
	   The ethnic Albanians' political leader called it a false show,
and said NATO strikes on Serbia would be welcome.
	   ``The most critical issue is to stop the war machine of Belgrade
and to protect the people of Kosovo,'' said Ibrahim Rugova, who
long has advocated pacifism to settle the Serb-Albanian standoff in
Kosovo. ``That's an issue of humanity.''
	   In a flurry of moves, the Serbs invited U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to visit the southern Serbian province, issued a new
appeal for talks with ethnic Albanian negotiators, removed a key
police roadblock and showed reporters heavy equipment they said has
been withdrawn.
	   But Annan turned down the offer and the ethnic Albanians
indicated they aren't willing to talk with fighting still
continuing.
	   Britain and the United States, keeping up the pressure on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, warned strongly that the
time to prevent intervention is running out.
	   ``We cannot allow this conflict to spread again and risk what we
stopped in Bosnia starting over again in Kosovo,'' U.S. President
Bill Clinton said.
	   The international furor over the Serbs' eight-month crackdown in
separatist Kosovo has intensified this week, pushing the United
States and other countries to the verge of long-threatened
airstrikes.
	   The Serbs' efforts to crush separatist resistance in the
province, which is populated largely by ethnic Albanians, has
killed hundreds of people and driven an estimated 275,000 from
their homes.
	   Even as the Serbs said this week that they were halting their
action against Kosovo ``terrorists,'' evidence surfaced of at least
two massacres of civilians in the Drenica region within recent
days.
	   Claiming that media reports wrongly portray the situation in
Kosovo, Serb authorities said Annan should come himself to see the
``real situation.'' But Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said the
secretary-general was already receiving reports from U.N. officials
in the area.
	   Late Friday, the independent Beta news agency said Serbia's
Deputy Premier Ratko Markovic had invited an ethnic Albanian
negotiating team to meet as soon as possible to resume the
political dialogue which broke down last May.
	   But Fehmi Agani, chief ethnic Albanian negotiator, said the
letter seemed to be intended to ease some of the increasing
international pressure on Serbia rather than a sincere move.
	   ``I don't see how negotiations can possibly continue at this
point when the fighting in Kosovo has not ceased to this date,''
Agani said.
	   Things were moving on the ground in Kosovo. Serb police removed
a roadblock on the road from Pristina to Pec, a highly visible
symbol of the heavy police presence in Kosovo.
	   At the same time, Serb officials hastened to show reporters
heavy police equipment and weapons they say have been withdrawn
from the Kosovo conflict. Many of the men, they say, have been sent
on leave.
	   A makeshift bunker of truck tires and sandbags located at
Komorane, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Pristina, since the
start of the conflict in February was pulled down with a backhoe.
	   At a special police forces base at Ajvalija, the largest police
base in Kosovo located about five kilometers (three miles) east of
Pristina, Col. Bozidar Filic showed reporters seven armored
personnel carriers, armored jeeps and other vehicles, plus a Bell
helicopter, saying all had been withdrawn from the conflict with
the ethnic Albanians.
	   But Rugova and the ethnic Albanians weren't buying the Serbs'
statements.
	   ``The Serb military forces have not withdrawn from Kosovo, they
have only changed their tactical position,'' Rugova told reporters.
``The situation continues to be grave and dangerous.''
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, reported Serb forces attacked two villages
Friday near Malisevo in southwestern Kosovo, then sent in
reinforcements when KLA rebels showed heavy resistance.
	   For its part, the pro-Serb Media Center said Yugoslav army
border guards came under grenade-launcher fire from inside
Albania's territory near the Pogaj border outpost opposite Prizren,
Kosovo.
	   The top Serbian official in Kosovo lashed out at what he said
were ``daily fabrications of new massacres by the ethnic Albanian
propaganda machine.''
	   Veljko Odalovic, head of the provincial government, accused
world powers of helping terrorists in Kosovo by threatening Serbia
and the Yugoslav Federation.
	   Britain, among the most vocal supporters of NATO action as a
last resort, joined the United States in delivering a strong
warning.
	   ``This is a humanitarian disaster,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair
told Channel 4 TV News in London. ``I believe it will only be
stopped if Milosevic gets the clearest possible message ... namely,
if you carry on doing this, you will face a military penalty.''

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Unmoved by a plea for forgiveness, a
U.N. court on Friday sentenced a former Rwandan mayor to life in
prison for his role in the deaths of 2,000 minority Tutsis who had
sought his protection.
	   Jean-Paul Akayesu, who portrayed himself as a lowly village
mayor powerless to halt the evil that engulfed Rwanda in 1994, also
was sentenced to 80 years for other violations, including rape.
	   In the first judgment by an international court on genocide,
Akayesu was convicted Sept. 2 of nine counts in connection with the
slaughter of more than 500,000 people.
	   Judge Laity Kama ruled that Akayesu ``chose to participate in
the genocide'' and should therefore spend the rest of his life in
prison, according to the Swiss-based Hirondelle news agency.
	   ``The chamber is of the opinion ... that genocide constitutes
the crime of crimes,'' Kama said. Akayesu was ordered to serve the
sentences for genocide, crimes against humanity and other
violations concurrently, which means he will serve a single life
sentence.
	   Following the sentencing, Akayesu moved slowly under the watch
of U.N. security guards and collected documents from the table
where he sat alone after firing his lawyers for a third time this
week.
	   Akayesu had made an impassioned plea Monday for forgiveness from
the Rwandan people for his failure to halt the killing by Hutu
extremists wielding machetes and clubs studded with nails.
	   The court acknowledged that Akayesu initially prevented the
massacres in the central village of Taba, and played a relatively
small role in the government that perpetrated the genocide.
	   But Kama ruled that Akayesu later endorsed the plan to
exterminate Tutsis, and was ``individually and criminally
responsible for the deaths.''
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was formed in
November 1994, months after an extremist Hutu government sponsored
the 90-day slaughter. The genocide ended only when Tutsi-led rebels
took power in July 1994.
	   Prosecutor Pierre Prosper, who called the former mayor a
predator, had asked for seven life sentences plus additional lesser
sentences for other crimes. He later said he was satisfied with
Akayesu's life sentence, the maximum penalty the U.N. tribunal can
impose.
	   In Kigali, Rwanda, Mary Balikungeri said the women who survived
rape and genocide in Taba were not satisfied. ``It's better than
nothing but still to the survivors, if you've killed, you must pay
with your life,'' said the director of Hope Clinic, which counsels
Tutsi women who survived the genocide.
	   Akayesu has appealed his convictions in the 20-month trial,
Hirondelle reported.
	   The tribunal, in Akayesu's precedent-setting judgment, had ruled
that rape and sexual violence were brutally wielded as tools of
genocide in Rwanda in 1994. No one accused Akayesu personally of
rape, but many witnesses said he incited the sexual abuse of Tutsi
women. He was sentenced to 15 years for rape.
	   The tribunal is holding 31 people in Arusha. Another person is
in custody in Texas.
	   Friday's sentencing was the tribunal's second. Former Prime
Minister Jean Kambanda, 42, pleaded guilty in May and was sentenced
to life imprisonment on Sept. 4.
	   Rwandan courts have tried at least 330 people in the genocide,
and 116 have been sentenced to death. A total of 126,078 people are
imprisoned and awaiting trial, according to the Red Cross.
	   All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials
pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination. The
trials predated the establishment of the crime of genocide 50 years
ago.

Owen shoots course record 62, Jacobson in lead, Westwood pursues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds : UPDATES with late results

<TEXT>
	   KNOKKE, Belgium (AP) _ England's Greg Owen shot nine birdies on
his way to a course-record 62 Friday to move into contention at the
Belgacom Open, four shots off the half-way pace set by Sweden's
Fredrik Jacobson.
	   Jacobson, who needs a good result here to keep his European Tour
card, followed up Thursday's 65 with a 67 to take him into the lead
at 10 under par.
	   Dutchman Rolf Muntz was one shot off the lead with New Zealand's
Greg Turner a further shot back at 8-under par.
	   Standing in fourth place, just 3 shots off the lead, Lee
Westwood kept his hopes alive to squeeze past the Order of Merit
leader Colin Montgomerie, a no-show here, during the season-ending
Volvo Masters at the end of the month.
	   Westwood knows the 66,600 pound top prize here would bring him
within striking distance. He is currently 112,000 pounds behind
Montgomerie's leading 760,077 pounds. Two victories in the last two
events would give him the Order of Merit title, whatever Montgomery
did.
	   ``If I can win here we have only the Volvo Masters to play and
then it's in my own hands,'' Westwood said.
	   Owen, 26, needed just 25 putts to smash the old record by two
strokes on the par-71 Royal Zoute course in this North Sea resort.
	   ``This is easily the best round of my life,'' said Owen, whose
previous best was a 67. The stunning round was such a surprise that
the Englishman had to start unpacking again, so sure had he been he
would miss the half-way cut.
	   Jacobson needs a good showing at the 400,000-pound (dlrs
680,000) Belgacom Open to hold on to his European Tour Card. He has
only won 44,000 pounds (dlrs 75,000) and needs to finish in the top
eight to hold on to his tour card.
	   The Swede has been taking painkillers to ease the strain in his
back and keep his Tour challenge going this week.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ This African kingdom remained in turmoil
Friday after South Africa _ whose troops moved in last week to
crush a military rebellion _ announced new elections would be held
within 18 months.
	   South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said Friday evening
that day-long talks _ mediated by officials from South Africa,
Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique _ between the ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy and opposition groups had resulted in an
agreement to hold elections in 15 to 18 months.
	   But opposition coalition spokeswoman Mamelo Morrison told the
South African Press Association the announcement was premature.
	   ``What your deputy president said was a lie,'' SAPA quoted
Morrison as saying. ``We have not come anywhere near agreement.
This has just put the whole negotiations into chaos.''
	   Chaos has been prevalent in this Belgium-sized country since
hundreds of South African troops _ acting on behalf of the Southern
African Development Community _ poured over the Lesotho border on
Sept. 22 to quell an army mutiny and a series of strikes aimed at
overturning the results of the May general elections.
	   Dozens of people were killed, mostly in clashes between South
African and Lesotho soldiers. The intervention sparked a wave of
looting and arson attacks that has left much of the capital,
Maseru, in ashes.
	   The current government, elected by a landslide in the election
which opposition groups claim were rigged, will stay in power until
new elections are held in 15 to 18 months, Mbeki said.
	   The announcement was the result of a day of talks to try to
resolve the political turmoil.
	   ``This important agreement lays a firm basis for the return of
Lesotho to normality,'' Mbeki declared.
	   A regional commission found irregularities in May election but
not enough to warrant overturning the result.
	   ``The Independent Electoral Commission will be reconstituted and
strengthened ... to ensure that these general elections are free
and fair and that all political parties participating in the
elections are assured of a level playing field.''
	   Mbeki said Southern African Development Community troops would
remain until Lesotho's security forces ``are able to effectively
discharge their legal and constitutional roles.''
	   Opposition parties will ``cooperate'' with that mission, Mbeki
said. However, he did not specify if they had agreed to cooperate.
	   In addition to the more than 1,000 South African troops, there
are at least 200 from Botswana in this Belgium-sized country of 2
million.
	   About 1,000 opposition supporters gathered outside King Letsie
III's palace while the talks were held at United Nations offices
down the road. Intervention troops warily looked on. No violence
was reported.
	   South African Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi heading
mediation efforts in Friday's talks, said South African government
spokesman Ricky Naidoo.
	   Refuting claims that 58 of its soldiers had died in the
intervention, the Lesotho Defense Force asserted in a statement
Friday that 18 were killed and nine injured. Nine South African
soldiers have also been killed, according to official figures.
	   The South African Council of Churches, meanwhile, said South
Africa and SADC should accept responsibility for the looting and
arson spree. Initially, businesses owned by followers of the ruling
party were targeted, but it quickly degenerated in a free-for-all
that wrecked the capital and caused an estimated 2 billion rands
(dlrs 350 million) in damage.
	   Neighboring countries should help rebuild Lesotho, the church
group said.
	   Taking a step in that direction, South Africa's National Union
of Mineworkers said Friday it would set up a fund to help rebuild
essential services. Between 80,000 and 90,000 people from Lesotho
work in South Africa's mines, their wages generating most of the
income of this impoverished nation which is surrounded by South
Africa.

Israel seals off West Bank, Gaza indefinitely

 &UR; Eds: ADDS Netanyahu quotes on fight against terror

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel closed its borders with the Palestinian
territories on Friday in efforts to prevent what Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said were plans for an ``unprecedented,
horrific'' attack that could set back peace talks.
	   The army was trying to prevent a bombing by the Islamic militant
group Hamas, which could hamper Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on
an Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   Although Israeli officials said the U.S.-brokered talks have
brought some advances toward a deal they hope to conclude in a
four-day summit in Washington in mid-October, the Palestinians
remained skeptical.
	   Hamas has vowed to carry out attacks against Israel after
Israeli soldiers killed two of the group's leaders last month.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that the
security forces could not be totally effective in combating terror
groups.
	   ``We have to know that, during this fight, we will take some
blows,'' Netanyahu told public television. ``We are working against
those murderers so there will be less attacks or none at all.''
	   Netanyahu said he would judge the seriousness of the Palestinian
Authority in peace talks by its willingness to crack down on
militant groups.
	   Israeli and Palestinian security forces have prevented bombing
attempts in recent weeks by Hamas whose attacks since 1994 have
killed dozens of Israelis.
	   Palestinian police caught two Hamas members with 60 kilos (130
pounds) of explosives in the Gaza Strip a week ago and uncovered a
bomb factory of the group with almost a ton of explosives in the
West Bank city of Hebron, security officials said.
	   Another Hamas member was killed earlier this week when a car he
was in exploded in a West Bank village.
	   As the forces tried to avert attacks, the peace talks were not
getting anywhere, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Friday.
	   Arafat said no great progress had been made in his two meetings
with Netanyahu last month in the United States.
	   ``No substantial progress ... pickup 10th graf pvs.

Hingis retires in semifinal match against fellow Swiss
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Kucera beating Ivanisevic &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ As she prepares to defend her No. 1
ranking from the assault of Lindsay Davenport, Martina Hingis has
to worry about her fitness.
	   After blowing a 5-1 lead and a match point in the third set
against her fellow Swiss teen-ager Patty Schnyder, Hingis retired
at 5-5 after suffering cramps in the Grand Slam Cup semifinal.
	   ``I have to get into a better shape,'' Hingis said.
	   The first official showdown between the two teammates had lasted
two hours and 11 minutes by the time Hingis retired. Hingis won the
first set 7-5, Schnyder took the second, also 7-5.
	   ``I haven't had enough time to recover since the U.S. Open, but
I also have to work on my fitness,'' said Hingis, who turned 18 on
Wednesday.
	   ``If you have certain assets, if you know that you can win with
these assets without going to your workout studio all the time, you
tend to neglect your workout studio,'' she said.
	   ``Usually I try to have the others players move around the court
without moving myself too much,'' Hingis said.
	   Schnyder, 19, made Hingis run a lot and felt she could have won
the match anyway.
	   ``I think I would have won those two games, but it's true, she
retired and I didn't really win it,'' Schnyder said.
	   ``In a regular tournament or in a Grand Slam, she would have
played those last two games, even at the risk of a major injury,''
Schnyder said. ``But this is not a tournament where you can win
points and she's got a few tournaments coming up where she has to
defend her No. 1 position.''
	   Hingis admitted as much. ``Why continue? I would have had no
chance anyway.''
	   ``I didn't want to suffer more, to get a worse injury,'' she
said. ``I still want to play the next two tournaments.''
	   The first is next week in Filderstadt, Germany, where Davenport
can seize the top ranking. Davenport lost her opening match here,
against Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Hingis also suffered cramps in a match against Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario in the Fed Cup final two weeks ago. Although she
won that match, Spain beat Switzerland for the title.
	   After winning three of the four Grand Slam tournaments last year
(Australian Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open) and reaching the final
of the French Open, Hingis captured only one this year _ the first
one in Australia.
	   Since then, Hingis has won only three more titles, at Indian
Wells, Hamburg and Rome, and she lost the U.S. Open final to
Davenport, her third loss to the American this year.
	   In men's quarterfinals, Andre Agassi rallied to beat Petr Korda
4-6, 6-0, 6-1, while Karol Kucera ousted Goran Ivanisevic 5-7, 6-4,
8-6.
	   Korda, the Australian Open champion, was the only men's Grand
Slam winner in the tournament that nominally brings together
players with best records at the four events.
	   Agassi, a wild card, dropped his serve to lose the first set but
then went on a roll, winning the next eight games.
	   ``I just got the momentum and I kept it,'' Agassi said.
	   Korda's double-fault at match point was typical of his
performance: 16 double-faults and 39 unforced errors.
	   While the first set lasted 37 minutes, Agassi needed only 47 for
the next two. He won his opening match against Cedric Pioline in a
tournament-record 34 minutes.
	   ``I drank too much coffee, I had too much energy,'' he said.
	   Although there are no ranking points to be earned at the dlrs
6.7 million tournament, there is plenty of money to compensate.
	   Schnyder earned dlrs 400,000 _ and could double that for winning
the title.
	   Hingis got dlrs 200,000, plus a dlrs 100,000 bonus for her
Australian Open title.
	   Korda, winner here in 1993, received a bye into the
quarterfinals and for one match made a total of dlrs 300,000 _
including a dlrs 125,000 bonus for his Australian Open title.
	   Agassi and Kucera, who will clash in the semifinals, got dlrs
325,000 for reaching the semifinals. The men's winner will earn
dlrs 1.3 million.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A British woman was scheduled to return home
Friday after suffering injuries from a gliding accident in Yemen,
officials said.
	   The woman fell Thursday while gliding over the town of Manakha
and hurt her pelvis, said the officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Manakha, a mountainous area, is 90 kilometers (56 miles) west of
the capital, San`a.
	   The woman's name and hometown or other details about the
accident were not immediately available.
	   Health Minister Abdullah Abdul-Wali Nasher visited her at the
Thawra hospital in San`a where she was treated. She had come to
Yemen with a group of seven European amateur gliders.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fourteen bodies have been found under the rubble
of a five-story apartment building seriously damaged by a gas
explosion and fire in Kazakstan, and four residents are still
missing, a news agency said Friday.
	   The explosion Tuesday in the central Kazak town of Saran split
the building in half and caused 15 apartments to collapse.
	   The fire was fueled by coal, firewood and materials used for
welding in the basement of the building, ITAR-Tass said. It said
the thick, pungent smoke from the fire hampered firefighters and
rescuers, but that three survivors were found.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ This African kingdom remained in turmoil
Friday after South Africa _ whose troops moved in last week to
crush a military rebellion _ announced new elections would be held
within 18 months.
	   South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said Friday evening
that day-long talks _ mediated by officials from South Africa,
Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique _ between the ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy and opposition groups had resulted in an
agreement to hold elections in 15 to 18 months.
	   But opposition coalition spokeswoman Mamelo Morrison said that
while there was ``tentative agreement'' on the holding of elections
within 18 months, details had not been agreed upon.
	   ``What your deputy president said was a lie,'' the South African
Press Association quoted Morrison as saying. ``We have not come
anywhere near agreement. This has just put the whole negotiations
into chaos.''
	   She said opposition party leaders were discussing whether to
continue with the negotiations.
	   Chaos has been prevalent in this Belgium-sized country since
hundreds of South African troops _ acting on behalf of the Southern
African Development Community _ poured over the Lesotho border on
Sept. 22 to quell an army mutiny and a series of strikes aimed at
overturning the results of the May general elections.
	   Dozens of people were killed, mostly in clashes between South
African and Lesotho soldiers. The intervention sparked a wave of
looting and arson attacks that has left much of the capital,
Maseru, in ashes.
	   The current government, elected by a landslide in the election
which opposition groups claim were rigged, will stay in power until
new elections are held in 15 to 18 months, Mbeki said.
	   ``This important agreement lays a firm basis for the return of
Lesotho to normality,'' Mbeki declared.
	   A regional commission found irregularities in May election but
not enough to warrant overturning the result.
	   ``The Independent Electoral Commission will be reconstituted and
strengthened ... to ensure that these general elections are free
and fair and that all political parties participating in the
elections are assured of a level playing field,'' Mbeki said.

	   ITAJUIPE, Brazil (AP) _ Luciene Ramos dos Santos knew a year ago
who she would vote for in Sunday's election _ whoever would buy her
a refrigerator.
	   Like many voters in Brazil's poor Northeast, dos Santos doesn't
expect anything from the politicians who win national elections
once they take office. So, she makes the most of their need for her
now.
	   ``Candidates or their friends pass by and ask if we need
anything. They write it down, and then we wait and see who comes
through,'' she said, standing outside her clapboard shack plastered
with campaign posters.
	   While Brazil has made strides in curtailing election fraud,
vote-buying is a time-hallowed practice in the poor interior.
Candidates offer everything from cash to coffins and vasectomies
for votes.
	   One popular gift is a new pair of shoes _ one is given before
the election and the other after, if the votes are delivered.
	   ``Unfortunately, it's become a tradition to give away shingles,
cement, medical care and even plastic surgery in exchange for
votes,'' explains Maria Alice Pereira, a campaign coordinator in
this cocoa-growing region 800 kilometers (500 miles) northeast of
Rio de Janeiro.
	   Pereira said the candidates she represents didn't buy votes.
	   The practice is most prevalent in poor districts and small
towns, where mayors rely on state and federal political bosses to
get funding for public works projects, explained Agenor Gasparetto,
head of the election consulting firm Socio Estatistica.
	   In return for funds, he said, mayors are expected to deliver
their town's votes _ all of them _ for the ruling party's
candidates. If the town as a whole votes the way the party desires,
gifts are doled out.
	   Gasparetto said it was common for mayors to hoard building
supplies, medical care and food earmarked for the poor until
election time, when it could be exchanged for votes.
	   Sometimes, the exchange is more subtle.
	   Roland Lavigne, a doctor and candidate for Congress, drives into
small interior towns in an air-conditioned mobile hospital,
offering medical examinations and minor surgery.
	   Before patients are examined, their photo is taken with a
digital camera. On leaving, they receive a calender with their
pictures next to Lavigne's, a reminder of their benefactor.
	   Gasparetto estimates that in Itajuipe and other southern Bahia
state towns as many as 45 percent of voters may be influenced by
such favors.
	   Earlier this week, dos Santos still was waiting for firm
commitments on part, if not all, of the 150 reals (dlrs 130) she
needs for her refrigerator. But she was hopeful _ last election, a
candidate paid for her 30-real (dlrs 30 at the time) refillable
cooking gas canister.
	   Those who are better off trade their votes for jobs or services,
Gasparetto said. ``It may not be as obvious as it is with the poor,
but there's a certain tolerance for this on all levels,'' he added.
	   Certainly, expectations seemed high among the crowd gathered at
a new hospital in nearby Itabuna, where Mayor Fernando Gomes
temporarily moved his office 45 days before the elections.
	   Thousands of middle-class residents flocked to the hospital,
arriving on the new road lined with flags advertising Gomes's
preferred candidates. A billboard describes the hospital as ``the
Public Works Project of the Century.''
	   Under the hospital's futuristic blue dome, Gomes patiently
examined the resumes of more than 10,000 job seekers.

Serbs show evidence of withdrawal, ethnic Albanians say all is

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With the clock ticking down to
possible NATO airstrikes, Serb authorities scrambled Friday to show
they are complying with U.N. demands to pull back their forces and
bring peace to Kosovo.
	   The ethnic Albanians' political leader called it a false show,
and said he would welcome NATO strikes on Serbia.
	   ``The most critical issue is to stop the war machine of Belgrade
and to protect the people of Kosovo,'' said Ibrahim Rugova, who
wants to settle peacefully the Serb-Albanian standoff in Kosovo.
``That's an issue of humanity.''
	   In a flurry of moves, the Serbs invited U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to visit the southern Serbian province, issued a new
appeal for talks with ethnic Albanian negotiators, removed a key
police roadblock and showed reporters heavy equipment they said has
been withdrawn.
	   But Annan turned down the offer and the ethnic Albanians
indicated they aren't willing to talk until fighting stops.
	   Britain and the United States, keeping up the pressure on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, warned that time to prevent
intervention is running out.
	   ``We cannot allow this conflict to spread again and risk what we
stopped in Bosnia starting over again in Kosovo,'' U.S. President
Bill Clinton said.
	   The international furor over the Serbs' eight-month crackdown in
separatist Kosovo has intensified this week, pushing the United
States and other countries to the verge of long-threatened
airstrikes.
	   The Serbs' efforts to crush separatist resistance in the
province, which is populated largely by ethnic Albanians, has
killed hundreds of people and driven about 275,000 from their
homes.
	   Even as the Serbs said this week that they were halting their
action against Kosovo ``terrorists,'' evidence surfaced of at least
two massacres of civilians in the Drenica region within recent
days.
	   Claiming that media reports wrongly portray the situation in
Kosovo, Serb authorities said Annan should come himself to see the
``real situation.'' But Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said the
secretary-general was already receiving reports from U.N. officials
in the area.
	   Late Friday, the independent Beta news agency said Serbia's
Deputy Premier Ratko Markovic had invited an ethnic Albanian
negotiating team to meet as soon as possible to resume the
political dialogue which broke down last May.
	   But Fehmi Agani, chief ethnic Albanian negotiator, said the
letter seemed to be intended to ease some of the increasing
international pressure on Serbia rather than a sincere move.
	   ``I don't see how negotiations can possibly continue at this
point when the fighting in Kosovo has not ceased to this date,''
Agani said.
	   Things were moving on the ground in Kosovo. Serb police removed
a roadblock on the road from Pristina to Pec, a highly visible
symbol of the heavy police presence in Kosovo.
	   Also, Serb officials showed reporters heavy police equipment and
weapons they say have been withdrawn from the Kosovo conflict. Many
of the men, they say, have been sent on leave.
	   A makeshift bunker of truck tires and sandbags at Komorane, 20
kilometers (12 miles) west of Pristina, since the start of the
conflict in February was removed.
	   At a special police forces base at Ajvalija, the largest police
base in Kosovo located about five kilometers (three miles) east of
Pristina, Col. Bozidar Filic showed reporters seven armored
personnel carriers, armored jeeps and other vehicles, plus a Bell
helicopter, saying all had been withdrawn from the conflict with
the ethnic Albanians.
	   But Rugova and the ethnic Albanians weren't buying the Serbs'
statements.
	   ``The Serb military forces have not withdrawn from Kosovo, they
have only changed their tactical position,'' Rugova told reporters.
``The situation continues to be grave and dangerous.''
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, reported Serb forces attacked two villages
Friday near Malisevo in southwestern Kosovo, then sent in
reinforcements when KLA rebels showed heavy resistance.
	   For its part, the pro-Serb Media Center said Yugoslav army
border guards came under grenade-launcher fire from inside
Albania's territory near the Pogaj border outpost opposite Prizren,
Kosovo.
	   The top Serbian official in Kosovo lashed out at what he said
were ``daily fabrications of new massacres by the ethnic Albanian
propaganda machine.''
	   Veljko Odalovic, head of the provincial government, accused
world powers of helping terrorists in Kosovo by threatening Serbia
and the Yugoslav Federation.
	   Britain, among the most vocal supporters of NATO action as a
last resort, joined the United States in delivering a strong
warning.
	   ``This is a humanitarian disaster,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair
told Channel 4 TV News in London. ``I believe it will only be
stopped if Milosevic gets the clearest possible message ... namely,
if you carry on doing this, you will face a military penalty.''

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel closed its borders with the Palestinian
territories on Friday in efforts to prevent what Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said were plans for an ``unprecedented,
horrific'' attack that could set back peace talks.
	   The army was trying to prevent a bombing by the Islamic militant
group Hamas, which could hamper Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on
an Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   Although Israeli officials said the U.S.-brokered talks have
brought some advances toward a deal they hope to conclude in a
four-day summit in Washington in mid-October, the Palestinians
remained skeptical.
	   Hamas has vowed to carry out attacks against Israel after
Israeli soldiers killed two of the group's leaders last month.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that the
security forces could not be totally effective in combating terror
groups.
	   ``We have to know that, during this fight, we will take some
blows,'' Netanyahu told public television. ``We are working against
those murderers so there will be less attacks or none at all.''
	   Netanyahu said he would judge the seriousness of the Palestinian
Authority in peace talks by its willingness to crack down on
militant groups.
	   Israeli and Palestinian security forces have prevented bombing
attempts in recent weeks by Hamas whose attacks since 1994 have
killed dozens of Israelis.
	   Palestinian police caught two Hamas members with 60 kilos (130
pounds) of explosives in the Gaza Strip a week ago and uncovered a
bomb factory of the group with almost a ton of explosives in the
West Bank city of Hebron, security officials said.
	   Another Hamas member was killed earlier this week when a car he
was in exploded in a West Bank village.
	   As the forces tried to avert attacks, the peace talks were not
getting anywhere, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Friday.
	   Arafat said no great progress had been made in his two meetings
with Netanyahu last month in the United States.

Rusedski powers through to semifinals; Siemerink ends Federer run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ No. 1 seed Greg Rusedski crushed French
challenger Arnaud Clement 6-4, 6-1 on Friday to qualify for the
semifinals of the dlrs 400,000 Toulouse Open tennis tournament.
	   Britain's Rusedski took just 56 minutes to win his quarterfinal
contest 6-4, 6-1.
	   Unseeded Clement, 20, dropped his opening service game and
always looked second best against the world No. 14, who clinched
the match by winning six straight games.
	   In the last four, Rusedski will face Germany's Nicolas Kiefer, a
6-2, 3-6, 6-1 winner over Marc Rosset of Switzerland.
	   Roger Federer, the 17-year-old junior Wimbledon champion, saw
his fine run end when he lost to No. 2 seed Jan Siemerink of the
Netherlands, 7-6, 6-2.
	   Federer has caused a sensation in Toulouse by beating two top 50
players, Richard Fromberg of Australia and France's Guillaume
Raoux, both in straight sets, in his first professional tournament.
	   A third shock looked on the cards when the first set went into a
tiebreak, but the Dutch player squeezed through 7-5, and proved too
strong in the next set, eventually winning 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.
	   In the next round, Siemerink will face either No. 3 seed Thomas
Johansson of Sweden or unseeded Frenchman Stephane Huet.

 &UR; Outspoken politician may become first eastern German parliament
president &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Wolfgang Thierse, a bearded, outspoken
Social Democrat from former East Germany, is seen as the top
candidate to take over as president of parliament, sources in the
leftist party said Friday.
	   Thierse, who will be 55 on Oct. 22, would replace Rita Suessmuth
of the Christian Democrats, who is stepping down after Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's conservatives were defeated by the Social Democrats
in Sunday's national elections.
	   While Thierse grew up in East Germany, he never joined the
communist party. He lost his job in the culture department of
Humboldt University in East Berlin for taking sides with dissident
singer Wolf Biermann who was banned to the west by the communists
in 1976.
	   Thierse joined the Social Democrats after the party regrouped in
East Berlin in early 1990 before unification and has been a member
of the Bundestag - or lower house of parliament - since winning a
seat in all German elections later that year.
	   A resident of the Prenzlauer Berg district of East Berlin,
Thierse often drew frowns from his western party colleagues for
arguing that government and parliament should move back to the
capital of Berlin to show unity with the eastern states.
	   In the end Thierse got his wish after a majority of parliament
voted in 1991 to return to what was always seen as the official
capital. The Berlin move is to be completed next summer and would
be all the sweeter to Thierse if parliament votes him president in
its first session expected on Oct. 26 or 27.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Police in southwestern Poland arrested two
Italian men Friday, who are wanted on international warrants for
armed assaults and car smuggling in Italy.
	   Identified only as Alessandro B. and Giovanni B., both 30 and
from Genoa, the two were found in Lwowek Slaski, some 460
kilometers (285 miles) southwest of Warsaw, during a police
investigation of feuds between the local gangs, police spokesman
Pawel Biedziak said.
	   Biedziak said the two were involved in prostitution and
organized the smuggling of alcohol and cigarettes between Poland,
the Czech Republic and Germany whose borders meet in the region.
	   Both remained arrested pending extradition to Italy, Biedziak
said.
	   Last month five men, two of them car smugglers, were shot in the
region in what police believe to be a war of gangs that thrive on
smuggling drugs and cars, between the three neighboring countries.

they are complying with U.N. demands to pull back their forces and

time to prevent intervention is running out.
	   ``We cannot allow this conflict to spread again and risk what we
stopped in Bosnia starting over again in Kosovo,'' U.S. President
Bill Clinton said.
	   The international furor over the Serbs' eight-month crackdown in
separatist Kosovo has intensified this week, pushing the United
States and other countries to the verge of long-threatened
airstrikes.
	   The Serbs' efforts to crush separatist resistance in the
province, which is populated largely by ethnic Albanians, has
killed hundreds of people and driven an estimated 275,000 from
their homes.
	   Even as the Serbs said this week that they were halting their
action against Kosovo ``terrorists,'' evidence surfaced of at least
two massacres of civilians in the Drenica region within recent
days.
	   Claiming that media reports wrongly portray the situation in
Kosovo, Serb authorities said Annan should come himself to see the
``real situation.'' But Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said the
secretary-general was already receiving reports from U.N. officials
in the area.
	   Late Friday, the independent Beta news agency said Serbia's
Deputy Premier Ratko Markovic had invited an ethnic Albanian
negotiating team to meet as soon as possible to resume the
political dialogue which broke down last May.
	   But Fehmi Agani, chief ethnic Albanian negotiator, said the
letter seemed to be intended to ease some of the increasing
international pressure on Serbia rather than a sincere move.
	   ``I don't see how negotiations can possibly continue at this
point when the fighting in Kosovo has not ceased to this date,''
Agani said.
	   Things were moving on the ground in Kosovo. Serb police removed
a roadblock on the road from Pristina to Pec, a highly visible
symbol of the heavy police presence in Kosovo.
	   At the same time, Serb officials hastened to show reporters
heavy police equipment and weapons they say have been withdrawn
from the Kosovo conflict. Many of the men, they say, have been sent
on leave.
	   But Rugova and the ethnic Albanians weren't buying the Serbs'
statements.
	   ``The Serb military forces have not withdrawn from Kosovo, they
have only changed their tactical position,'' Rugova told reporters.
``The situation continues to be grave and dangerous.''
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, reported Serb forces attacked two villages
Friday near Malisevo in southwestern Kosovo, then sent in
reinforcements when KLA rebels showed heavy resistance.
	   It also said 20 more bodies had been discovered in the Drenica
region, some near the site where civilians were massacred last
weekend.
	   For its part, the pro-Serb Media Center said Yugoslav army
border guards came under grenade-launcher fire from inside
Albania's territory near the Pogaj border outpost opposite Prizren,
Kosovo.
	   The top Serbian official in Kosovo lashed out at what he said
were ``daily fabrications of new massacres by the ethnic Albanian
propaganda machine.''
	   Veljko Odalovic, head of the provincial government, accused
world powers of helping terrorists in Kosovo by threatening Serbia
and the Yugoslav Federation.
	   Britain, among the most vocal supporters of NATO action as a
last resort, joined the United States in delivering a strong
warning.
	   ``This is a humanitarian disaster,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair
told Channel 4 TV News in London. ``I believe it will only be
stopped if Milosevic gets the clearest possible message ... namely,
if you carry on doing this, you will face a military penalty.''
	   But Russia's parliament declared any NATO military action taken
without U.N. approval would be considered an ``illegal act of
aggression.''

Britain sends more warplanes to Italy; Contact Group says time

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain said Friday it will send four more
fighter-bombers to a NATO base in southern Italy as part of the
buildup over the Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Defense Secretary George Robertson said the GR7 Harrier jump
jets will fly Monday from Laarbruch, a British base in Germany, to
Gioia del Colle, bringing the number of Royal Air Force warplanes
there to eight.
	   ``This deployment shows that we mean business and if the
violence does not stop, then Britain will play its full part in
what needs to be done,'' Robertson said.
	   Senior representatives from the six Contact Group countries _
the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Russia _ met
here Friday and said that they were ''united in condemning what is
happening on the ground'' in Kosovo, where a Serb crackdown on
ethnic Albanian rebels wanting independence has left hundreds dead
and more than 270,000 homeless since it began in February.
	   ``We all concluded that time is running out,'' a statement from
the six said in reference to possible NATO military action.
	   ''We are determined to get compliance one way or another,'' a
British Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on terms of customary
anonymity, said after the talks. The group want Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to halt military action in Kosovo, allow
humanitarian agencies into the province and agree to a long-term
peace solution.
	   Also Friday, the government warned Britons not to travel to
Yugoslavia, and England canceled a soccer match with Yugoslavia
which was to have been played in London Nov. 18. The English
Football Association said it acted now to end uncertainty over the
fixture.
	   The Foreign Office said Britons in Yugoslavia should consider
leaving now, or be prepared to go at short notice.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair again warned of military reprisals if
attacks against ethnic Albanians _ blamed on Serbs _ continued in
Kosovo.
	   ``The objective is the same as the objective throughout, which
is to make him (President Slobodan Milosevic) stop committing
atrocities and barbarism within Kosovo,'' Blair told Channel 4
News.
	   ``This is a humanitarian disaster. I believe it will only be
stopped if Milosevic gets the clearest possible message, which is
an unmixed message, namely, if you carry on doing this you will
face a military penalty.''
	   Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1 in the two
million population, is in southern Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.

Election results certified, moderates win more power
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Although nationwide
elections produced less change than hoped, the election results
certified Friday have increased the power of moderates.
	   Election supervisors announced the official results and the
allocation of seats for the legislative bodies in voting that took
place three weeks ago.
	   ``Pluralism has won today,'' said U.S. Ambassador Robert Barry,
the head of the Bosnian branch of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe charged with organizing and supervising the
elections.
	   Parties considered moderate for the most part won at all levels,
apart from the disappointing victory of ultra-nationalist Nikola
Poplasen over moderate Biljana Plavsic for president of the Bosnian
Serb half of the country.
	   Under the Bosnian peace agreement negotiated in Dayton, Ohio, in
1995 Bosnia was divided into two halves _ the Bosnian Serb republic
and the Muslim-Croat Federation. Both have their own parliaments,
governments and presidents. The entities are loosely linked by a
joint presidency, parliament and government.
	   Previously, hard-line nationalist parties, seeking the division
of the country had the majority and blocked the peace process,
forcing international officials on the ground to impose solutions.
	   Barry believes the elections will entail authorities who are
``more responsive to the will of the people.''
	   He said the message of the voters to their leaders was: ``Get on
with the issues that are a concern to us, act responsibly, make
decisions for yourselves and don't wait for the international
community to make them for you!''
	   For the first time, some minority parties are represented in
parliaments of the country.
	   The Serb National Assembly may play a key role in the future,
since it can approve or reject Poplasen's proposals for a premier
in case he offers a hard-liner like himself.
	   It was important that ``nobody in that parliament has a blocking
majority as was the case in the past,'' Barry said. Pro-Dayton
forces have won more seats over hard-liners on all levels.
	   With the general elections certified, international institutions
in Bosnia will move over to the harder part - the implementation of
results and monitoring the work of the new authorities.
	   ``We expect those parties which have won mandates from the
electorate to respect democratic principles in forming executive
bodies,'' Barry said.

New deputy international editors announced
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Associated Press has appointed two deputy
international editors.
	   Sally Jacobsen, an economics specialist who has spent nearly a
decade in international reporting, will become deputy international
editor, concentrating on the day-to-day world news report and
enterprise.
	   Kevin Noblet, who has been deputy international editor since
1993, will become deputy international editor/training. He will
concentrate on identifying prospective international
correspondents, training them in advance of their assignments and
monitoring their performance abroad.
	   The appointments were announced Friday by AP International
Editor Thomas J. Kent.
	   Jacobsen joined the AP in 1976 in Baltimore. Beginning in 1979,
she worked for six years in the news cooperative's Washington
bureau, specializing in economic reporting. She then worked in
Mexico City and for seven years in Brussels as correspondent for
the European Union and NATO affairs.
	   Jacobsen held a Jefferson Fellowship for Asian studies at the
East-West Center in Honolulu in 1996 and then joined AP's Business
News Department in New York, specializing in international economic
issues.
	   A Colorado native, she earned a bachelor's degree from Iowa
State University and a master's from Cornell University.
	   Noblet joined the AP in New Orleans in 1980 after working for
newspapers in Connecticut.
	   He spent nine years based in Argentina, Chile and Puerto Rico
before becoming deputy international editor in New York. A graduate
of Concordia College in Bronxville, Noblet was a 1990-91 Nieman
Fellow at Harvard University.

 &UR; Croatia throws warm welcome for pope
 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ With rock bands, giant screens and tens
of thousands of people on the streets, Croatia rolled out the
welcome mat Friday for Pope John Paul II as he came to honor a
World War II cardinal held as a hero by Catholics but accused by
Serbs of sympathizing with the Nazis.
	   It was John Paul's second visit to the country, considered by
the Vatican a Catholic bastion in the Balkans. When he first came
in 1994, the Balkans war was still raging following the breakup of
Yugoslavia.
	   ``Now, happily. the war is no more,'' he told a crowd of young
people standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the cathedral square in
Zagreb's medieval city center. ``My hope is that there will never
again be war in this noble country,'' he said to sustained
applause.
	   He then entered the cathedral, knelt and prayed for two minutes
before the glass tomb of Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, embalmed in
red and gold vestments and a gold miter.
	   John Paul is scheduled to beatify Stepinac on Saturday in Marija
Bistrica, the country's leading Marian shrine, outside of Zagreb.
Beatification is the last step before possible sainthood.
	   While serving as Zagreb's archbishop in 1941, Stepinac supported
Croatia's German-backed fascist puppet government led by dictator
Ante Pavelic.
	   By 1942, however, Stepinac denounced the regime's genocidal
policies, which led to the extermination of thousands of Serbs,
Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents. Stepinac's own notes and recent
studies say he spoke out against the atrocities, and worked to save
lives, but many Serbs still consider him a war criminal.
	   After the war, the cardinal was tried by Yugoslavia's communist
government and sentenced to prison for collaboration with the
Nazis. He died while under house arrest, the basis of the Vatican's
finding that he died for his faith.
	   The 78-year-old pope, slowed by a series of ailments in recent
years, appeared in good form and delighted by the welcome. He
walked with a cane at the airport, but handed it to an aide when he
reached the cathedral.
	   The streets were packed, with well-wishers following his drive
in from the airport in the white popemobile on giant streets
erected in downtown Zagreb.
	   Helicopters whirred overhead, above the cathedral spires. Two
bands warmed up the crowd.
	   In arrival remarks, he called on Croats to spur reconciliation
among the nation's ethnic, religious and political groups. In a
gentle jab at the government that has ruled since Croatia broke
from communist Yugoslavia, he urged ``an ever greater
democratization of society.''
	   ``The obstacles created by the consequences of war and the
mentality shaped by the Communist regime are many,'' the pope said.
``I hope most fervantly that in this part of Europe there will
never again be a repetition of the inhuman situations which we have
repeatedly seen in this century.''
	   At the airport to greet him was President Franjo Tudjman, who
complained that ``certain international factors are pressuring
us,'' an apparent reference to calls by the West for Croatia to
strengthen its democratic institutions.
	   Both Tudjman and the pope spoke of Croatia's long Catholic
history, with John Paul referring to persecution under the Romans,
the Ottoman occupation and ``the terrible period of Communist
repression.''
	   The Vatican was one of the first countries to recognize an
independent Croatia. Of the country's 4.5 million citizens, the
Vatican estimates 80 percent are Catholic.

Mayfield finds different scenario in latest Charlotte race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOE MACENKA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CONCORD, North Carolina (AP) _ The last time the Winston Cup
circuit visited Charlotte Motor Speedway, Jeremy Mayfield had a
much better view of the season points race.
	   Mayfield goes into Sunday's UAW-GM Quality 500 in sixth place in
the 1998 driver standings, virtually eliminated from title
contention. With six races left, he is 784 points behind leader
Jeff Gordon.
	   It's a far different from late May, when the series rolled into
Charlotte for its all-star race and the Coca-Cola 600 on
consecutive weekends.
	   At that time, Mayfield was the Winston Cup points leader.
	   ``It's been a learning experience,'' he said. ``We've had some
ups and downs _ probably more downs than ups. But I think it's
going to be something that's going to help us in the future.''
	   Consistency wasn't a problem early in the year, even though the
team was reorganized during the offseason and switched from the
Ford Thunderbird to the Taurus. Mayfield was third in the
season-opening Daytona 500, one of six top-10 finishes he had in
the first 10 races.
	   A second-place finish at the California 500 put him atop the
points standings for the first time in his career, and on June 21,
he added another important first to the list by winning the Pocono
500 for his inaugural Winston Cup victory.
	   That was the last time Mayfield would lead the points race. He
finished 18th in the next event at Sears Point Raceway, starting a
stretch of five races in which he didn't post any top-10 finishes.
	   Culprits included a blown tire one week and a poor pit stop the
next. Several times, the car just didn't run well.
	   The bad stretch dropped him to sixth in the points, and he's
been unable to get any higher since.
	   But Mayfield remains optimistic, and team co-owner Michael
Kranefuss shares his view. Their position is supported by top-five
finishes in two of the last four races.
	   Mayfield will start ninth Sunday at Charlotte, where he has
raced 10 times and never finished better than 19th.
	   No matter what happens during the race, Mayfield considers it
another chance to learn and grow as he points toward his ultimate
goal of winning a season title.
	   ``I've been in different situations I've never been in before,''
he said. ``I've gained a lot of experience, but I feel like I still
need more.''

Yugoslav government rejects blame, protests double standards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Responding to the recent United
Nations resolution on Kosovo, the Yugoslav government on Friday
blamed the violence on ethnic Albanian separatist rebels.
	   ``The federal government understands the concern expressed by
the U.N. Security Council about Kosovo,'' the government said in a
statement carried by the Tanjug news agency, but rejects the
criticism of it.
	   It claimed that fighting has ended in Kosovo following a string
of defeats of the ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   The government stressed that authorities have opened an
investigation to determine the culprits in the recent massacre of
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   ``The federal government expresses regret that the world has
reacted so sharply and with threats to uninvestigated information
while it remained silent to earlier monstrous crimes'' against Serb
civilians in Kosovo, the statement said.
	   ``Such double standards have brought no good anywhere,'' said
the government, protesting what it called a ``staged anti-Serb
media campaign.''
	   The government also announced a new session of the Yugoslav
federal parliament to discuss how to ``protect international
position and state interests'' of the country.

	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ A fiery explosion blew apart a car in a
crowded quarter of Naples on Friday, injuring 13 people, police
said. Authorities suspected a car bomb planted by one of the city's
warring crime clans.
	   One of the injured was reported in grave condition.
	   The blast went off outside a game room frequented by a clan of
the Camorra crime syndicate, Italy's ANSA news agency said.
	   Most of the victims were innocent passers-by _ local artisans,
waiters or young men driving by on motorbikes, the news agency
said.
	   The blast and the resulting fire destroyed at least five other
cars. It blew out windows in surrounding homes on the narrow street
and blackened building facades up to their fifth floors.
	   The bomb was apparently on or under a stolen car parked outside
the game room. Authorities believe it may have been detonated by
remote control.
	   The blast occurred in an area where two clans of the Camorra
crime syndicate are fighting for control. Attacks that hurt such a
large number of bystanders are unusual even in gang wars;
authorities feared it might signal a worsening of hostilities, RAI
state television said.

Faced by breakaway Super League, UEFA outlines improved Champions

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A UEFA Task Force announced Friday a new format
it's considering for a revamped European Champions' Cup to counter
the launch of a proposed breakaway European Super League.
	   Following 3 1/2 hours of meetings with several of Europe's
biggest clubs, the European Football 2000 Task Force unveiled two
concepts it was considering for a new league that would pay out
600-800 million Swiss francs (dlrs 440-590 million) in total prize
money.
	   ``The winners have the possibility to win between 60-80 million
Swiss francs,'' said UEFA General Secretary Gerhard Aigner. ``It
depends of the format the executive committee chooses next week at
meetings in Lisbon.''
	   UEFA revealed it is considering two different concepts for a
remodelled Champions' League - one involving 24 teams and another
with 32. The Task Force also proposed to merge the UEFA Cup and the
Cup Winners' Cup into one competition.
	   The 24-team model was the preferred one, UEFA said, since it
involved just 15 match days, more easily shoehorned into an already
tight schedule.
	   The format of a UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup merger had not yet
been developed, but would likely include 114 teams playing in
preliminary rounds followed by knock-out matches.
	   The proposals are in response to a Super League conceived by a
Milan-based marketing firm, Media Partners, currently attempting to
lure some of the biggest names in European soccer _ including
Bayern Munich, Ajax, Inter and AC Milan, Manchester United and
Arsenal _ into its new competition with a reported dlrs 1.2 billion
in prize money.
	   Though falling significantly short of the Super League's
jackpot, UEFA was quick to insist its prize money was guaranteed.
	   ``At UEFA we base ourselves on realistic figures and conditions,
which are facts today,'' said Aigner. ``And not on speculations of
what the market might give us tomorrow. So an engagement with UEFA
is risk-free.''
	   In order to finance the revamped league, UEFA said it would
investigate the possibility of Pay per View and Pay TV.
	   ``We must change our concepts,'' Aigner said. ``The present
concept has reached saturation as far as possibilities for
television. TV is already overpaying for rights and we cannot
endlessly stretch them to pay more and more.
	   ``We must look at other alternatives.''
	   Under any new concept, broadcasting contracts and marketing
would remain under UEFA control, Aigner said. UEFA remained
unwilling to allow national leagues to take control of domestic TV
rights.
	   ``We are firmly of the opinion it should be centralized,'' said
Aigner. ``Any league needs to be centralized, otherwise it's the
beginning of disintegration.''
	   Some leagues, however, disagreed.
	   ``It would preferable that each team sell its own rights,'' said
Franco Carraro, president of the Italian league. ``If UEFA insists
on a centralized sale of rights then it must be transparent, and
involve UEFA partners as well as the teams.
	   ``Italy is in favor of European competition remaining under
UEFA's control,'' Carraro concluded. ``But only under these
conditions.''
	   Last week, soccer's world ruling body FIFA said it was ready to
take drastic measures to ensure a spin-off Super League never got
off the ground.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said FIFA was prepared to suspend
national associations whose teams defected to join a Super League.

Ground employees strike at Toronto's airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ More than 500 employees at Toronto's main airport
went on strike Friday, causing only minor delays to flights but
predicting disruptions would worsen if the walkout continued.
	   The strikers _ including administrative, maintenance and
computer staff at Pearson International Airport _ walked off the
job after contract talks broke down Thursday evening.
	   Pickets partially blocked service entrances, causing delays of
up to 45 minutes for arriving airline employees, delivery trucks
and air traffic controllers. But many passengers at Canada's
busiest airport didn't notice anything amiss and airline staff
reported no significant delays in flights.
	   Steve Shaw, vice president of strategic planning for the Greater
Toronto Airports Authority, said airport managers plan to fill in
for striking workers.
	   But leaders of the striking Union of Canadian Transport
Employees doubted management would be able to keep the airport
running smoothly if the strike continues into next week.
	   On average, the three-terminal airport handles 75,000 passengers
a day. It is a major hub for domestic and international flights.
	   The employees, whose wages have been frozen for seven years, are
seeking wage hikes of 15 percent to 23 percent in the first year of
a new contract, and 5 percent in the next two years. Management is
offering 8 percent in the first year, and a range of increases in
the next two years depending on the job category.

Israel seals off West Bank, Gaza indefinitely
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS other name of Erekat. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Friday sealed its borders with the
West Bank and Gaza Strip indefinitely following warnings by the
defense minister that the Islamic militant group Hamas plotted an
``unprecedented, horrific'' attack in Israel.
	   The closure came as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reported
some progress in talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal. A Hamas
bombing would disrupt the U.S.-brokered negotiations which are to
climax with a four-day Mideast summit in Washington in mid-October.
	   However, the Palestinians denounced the closure as collective
punishment, saying it would hurt the Palestinian economy and keep
tens of thousands of workers from their jobs.
	   Israeli and Palestinian security forces have thwarted recent
attempts by Hamas to carry out attacks in Israel in retaliation for
the killing of two of the group's fugitives by Israeli soldiers.
	   A Palestinian security official said Friday that two Hamas
activists were caught a week ago with 60 kilos (130 pounds) of
explosives. The two were en route to the Nahal Oz crossing between
the Gaza Strip and Israel, the official said.
	   Earlier this week, a Hamas activist was killed when a car rigged
with explosives blew up in a West Bank village. In the West Bank
town of Hebron, Palestinian police seized nearly a ton of
explosives in a raid of a Hamas bomb factory.
	   Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in
Israel since 1994 and has threatened new attacks.
	   In troubled Hebron, meanwhile, dozens of Palestinians hurled
stones and empty bottles at Israeli soldiers who fired
rubber-coated steel pellets. Seven Palestinians were injured,
including one who was in serious condition.
	   Clashes erupted before and after Muslim noon prayers.
	   The Israeli-controlled downtown area of Hebron has been under
curfew since Wednesday when two grenades were thrown at Israeli
security forces, wounding 22 people. Hebron is home to 450 Jewish
settlers and 130,000 Palestinians.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai decided after
consultations with top army generals Friday to seal the West Bank
and Gaza indefinitely. The Israeli newspaper Maariv quoted
Mordechai as telling the Cabinet on Thursday that ``Hamas wants to
carry out a horrific, unprecedented attack in Israel.''
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the Palestinian
Authority has taken sporadic steps to control Hamas, but ``it's far
short of what we would like.''
	   Fogel warned that an attack would hurt the peace process. In the
past, Israel has suspended talks with the Palestinians after
large-scale attacks by Palestinian militants.
	   However, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the closure
constituted collective punishment and that Israel must stop taking
unilateral steps. ``Instead of taking us as partners, they (the
Israelis) subject us to closures,'' he said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to arrive Tuesday
in the Middle East for two days of talks to prepare for an summit
meeting in Washington.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton invited Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington to try to complete a
long-delayed agreement over a further Israeli pullback in the West
Bank. Saeb Erekat said the summit will take place Oct. 15-19.
	   Netanyahu faces conflicting pressures inside his own coalition
government. A Cabinet minister from the pro-settler National
Religious Party declared that Netanyahu should refuse to go to
Washington. Science Minister Silvan Shalom, from Netanyahu's Likud
Party rejected that, but only for tactical reasons. He told Israel
radio that ``Israel would get all the blame'' for a breakdown of
the peace talks and would face isolation in the world.

Hingis retires in semifinal match against fellow Swiss
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Williams winning &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ As she prepares to defend her No. 1
ranking from the assault of Lindsay Davenport, Martina Hingis has
to worry about her fitness.
	   After blowing a 5-1 lead and a match point in the third set
against her fellow Swiss teen-ager Patty Schnyder, Hingis retired
at 5-5 after suffering cramps in the Grand Slam Cup semifinal.
	   ``I have to get into a better shape,'' Hingis said.
	   In Sunday's final, Schnyder will meet Venus Williams, who swept
past Nathalie Tauziat 6-4, 6-0 after coming back from a break down
in the first set.
	   The first official showdown between the two teammates had lasted
two hours and 11 minutes by the time Hingis retired. Hingis won the
first set 7-5, Schnyder took the second, also 7-5.
	   ``I haven't had enough time to recover since the U.S. Open, but
I also have to work on my fitness,'' said Hingis, who turned 18 on
Wednesday.
	   ``If you have certain assets, if you know that you can win with
these assets without going to your workout studio all the time, you
tend to neglect your workout studio,'' she said.
	   ``Usually I try to have the others players move around the court
without moving myself too much,'' Hingis said.
	   Schnyder, 19, made Hingis run a lot and felt she could have won
the match anyway.
	   ``I think I would have won those two games, but it's true, she
retired and I didn't really win it,'' Schnyder said.
	   ``In a regular tournament or in a Grand Slam, she would have
played those last two games, even at the risk of a major injury,''
Schnyder said. ``But this is not a tournament where you can win
points and she's got a few tournaments coming up where she has to
defend her No. 1 position.''
	   Hingis admitted as much. ``Why continue? I would have had no
chance anyway.''
	   ``I didn't want to suffer more, to get a worse injury,'' she
said. ``I still want to play the next two tournaments.''
	   The first is next week in Filderstadt, Germany, where Davenport
can seize the top ranking. Davenport lost her opening match here,
to Tauziat.
	   Hingis also suffered cramps in a match against Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario in the Fed Cup final two weeks ago. Although she
won that match, Spain beat Switzerland for the title.
	   After winning three of the four Grand Slam tournaments last year
(Australian Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open) and reaching the final
of the French Open, Hingis captured only one this year _ the first
one in Australia.
	   Since then, Hingis has won only three more titles, at Indian
Wells, Hamburg and Rome, and she lost the U.S. Open final to
Davenport, her third loss to the American this year.
	   In men's quarterfinals, Andre Agassi rallied to beat Petr Korda
4-6, 6-0, 6-1, while Karol Kucera ousted Goran Ivanisevic 5-7, 6-4,
8-6.
	   Korda, the Australian Open champion, was the only men's Grand
Slam winner in the tournament that nominally brings together
players with best records at the four events.
	   Agassi, a wild card, dropped his serve to lose the first set but
then went on a roll, winning the next eight games.
	   ``I just got the momentum and I kept it,'' Agassi said.
	   Korda's double-fault at match point was typical of his
performance: 16 double-faults and 39 unforced errors.
	   While the first set lasted 37 minutes, Agassi needed only 47 for
the next two. He won his opening match against Cedric Pioline in a
tournament-record 34 minutes.
	   ``I drank too much coffee, I had too much energy,'' he said.
	   Although there are no ranking points to be earned at the dlrs
6.7 million tournament, there is plenty of money to compensate.
	   Schnyder and Williams earned dlrs 400,000, and the winner will
get dlrs 800,000.
	   Hingis got dlrs 200,000, plus a dlrs 100,000 bonus for her
Australian Open title.
	   Korda, winner here in 1993, received a bye into the
quarterfinals and for one match made a total of dlrs 300,000 _
including a dlrs 125,000 bonus for his Australian Open title.
	   Agassi and Kucera, who will clash in the semifinals, got dlrs
325,000 each. The men's winner will earn dlrs 1.3 million.

EU concerned over alleged mistreatment of Malaysia's ex-deputy
</HEADLINE>
premier

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Friday expressed
its ``deep concern'' over reports of physical abuse of Malaysia's
former deputy-prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who was arrested last
month.
	   ``The EU urges the Malaysian authorities to ensure that similar
incidents will not occur again in the future and that Anwar Ibrahim
be assured correct treatment while in custody,'' a statement by the
15 EU countries said.
	   The EU ``hopes that appropriate action will be taken against any
individuals, including officials, found responsible for such
mistreatment,'' the statement added.
	   On Sept. 2, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired
Anwar, calling him morally unfit for office. Mahathir and Anwar had
differed over economic policy and Anwar says Mahathir feared him as
an alternative leader.
	   Anwar mounted a nationwide campaign against the prime minister
before being detained as a national security risk and charged with
illegal homosexual acts and corruption in connection with those
allegations.
	   Earlier this week, Anwar appeared in court with a black eye and
bruises on his neck and arms. He told the magistrate's courts he
was beaten by police on Sept. 20, the night of his arrest.
	   Faced with mounting public criticism, Mahathir called Thursday
for a probe by the attorney general of the alleged mistreatment of
Anwar. The EU statement welcomed the opening of this investigation.
	   It also welcomed the release of seven youth leaders, including
Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, the head of the youth wing of the ruling United
Malays National Organization and a former ally of Anwar, who were
arrested last week in connection with demonstrations in favor of
the ousted deputy-premier.
	   ``The EU expresses hope that the other political demonstrators
still detained under the Internal Security Act will also be
released soon,'' the statement said.
	   The former deputy-premier, who was also finance minister,
pleaded innocent this week to charges of sodomy and corruption.
	   A number of Anwar's associates are still detained.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ With the Great Pyramids as a backdrop and
love songs wafting through the air, 216 Egyptian couples celebrated
their weddings Friday at a government-sponsored party to mark the
25th anniversary of a war with Israel.
	   The night time revelry, paid for by local businessmen, was held
at a sports stadium covered with giant cutouts of crimson hearts
and flowers. Green, red and blue laser lights flickered overhead.
	   At the start of the celebrations, brides in white wedding gowns
and grooms in dark suits walked arm in arm in a line into the
arena. Relatives and friends packing the stands cheered but their
their voices were drowned by the traditional Egyptian wedding music
blaring from loudspeakers.
	   ``I am very happy that I am with the one I love in a place like
this,'' said Sayed Abdul-Fadeel, 32, a stock broker, as his bride,
Fatima Hussein Mohammed, 25, clung to his arm.
	   Behind them at a distance, the Pyramids of Giza illuminated for
the nightly sound-and-light show towered above the stadium.
	   Like all other couples, Abdul-Fadeel and Mohammed had taken
their vows in private earlier Friday.
	   The couples were seated at tables laid out with eight-tiered
white cakes, juices and food donated by restaurants and hotels. The
newlyweds then took over the dance floor, swinging to disco music
and later Egyptian folk dance songs.
	   The party was organized by the governorate of Giza, the district
outside Cairo where the Pyramids are located.
	   Giza governor Maher al-Gindi told reporters that some Giza
hotels gave away three nights accommodation to some couples while
the others will get to spend their honeymoon at the Red Sea resorts
of Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheik.
	   El-Gindi said several shops in Giza will give gifts to the
newlyweds like beds, refrigerators, heaters and washing machines.
	   The celebrations were part of nationwide festivities marking the
the anniversary of the Oct. 6, 1973 assault when the Egyptian army
crossed the Suez Canal into the Israeli-occupied Sinai peninsula.
	   The crossing restored Egyptian pride in its military after its
humiliating defeat in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and led to the
Egypt-Israel peace accord in 1979.
	   Gov. Al-Gindi said the original plan was to host only those
couples born in 1973 but lifted that restriction when many of those
who applied did not meet that criterion.
	   A free wedding is undoubtedly welcome in Egypt where many young
cannot afford the cost of a traditional ceremony in a rented a hall
and the mandatory dinner for scores of guests.
	   Even modest weddings costs far more than an Egyptian's average
monthly income of 300 pounds (dlrs 66).
	   ``The Giza governorate can do something like this. I cannot. I
would never have been able to afford a wedding like this,'' said
Hani Mohammed, a 26-year-old English teacher.
	   But like every wedding, Friday's party was not without hitches.
	   At a rehearsal Thursday, a fight nearly broke out when the
couples were told that they could invite only four and not 10
people as promised earlier. A compromise was reached and each
couple got to invite six.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ With rock bands, giant screens and tens
of thousands of people on the streets, Croatia welcomed Pope John
Paul II on Friday as he came to honor a World War II cardinal held
as a hero by Catholics but accused by Serbs of sympathizing with
the Nazis.
	   It was John Paul's second visit to the country, considered by
the Vatican a Catholic bastion in the Balkans. When he first came
in 1994, the Balkans war was still raging following the breakup of
Yugoslavia.
	   ``Now, happily. the war is no more,'' he told a crowd of young
people standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the cathedral square in
Zagreb's medieval city center. ``My hope is that there will never
again be war in this noble country,'' he said to sustained
applause.
	   He then entered the cathedral, knelt and prayed for two minutes
before the glass tomb of Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, embalmed in
red and gold vestments and a gold miter.
	   John Paul is scheduled to beatify Stepinac on Saturday in Marija
Bistrica, the country's leading Marian shrine, outside of Zagreb.
Beatification is the last step before possible sainthood.
	   While serving as Zagreb's archbishop in 1941, Stepinac supported
Croatia's German-backed fascist puppet government led by dictator
Ante Pavelic.
	   By 1942, however, Stepinac denounced the regime's genocidal
policies, which led to the extermination of thousands of Serbs,
Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents. Stepinac's own notes and recent
studies say he spoke out against the atrocities, and worked to save
lives, but many Serbs still consider him a war criminal.
	   After the war, the cardinal was tried by Yugoslavia's communist
government and sentenced to prison for collaboration with the
Nazis. He died while under house arrest, the basis of the Vatican's
finding that he died for his faith.
	   The 78-year-old pope, slowed by a series of ailments in recent
years, appeared in good form and delighted by the welcome. He
walked with a cane at the airport, but handed it to an aide when he
reached the cathedral.
	   The streets were packed, with well-wishers following his drive
in from the airport in the white popemobile on giant streets
erected in downtown Zagreb.
	   Helicopters whirred overhead, above the cathedral spires. Two
bands warmed up the crowd.
	   In arrival remarks, he called on Croats to spur reconciliation
among the nation's ethnic, religious and political groups. In a
gentle jab at the government that has ruled since Croatia broke
from communist Yugoslavia, he urged ``an ever greater
democratization of society.''
	   ``The obstacles created by the consequences of war and the
mentality shaped by the Communist regime are many,'' the pope said.
``I hope most fervantly that in this part of Europe there will
never again be a repetition of the inhuman situations which we have
repeatedly seen in this century.''
	   At the airport to greet him was President Franjo Tudjman, who
complained that ``certain international factors are pressuring
us,'' an apparent reference to calls by the West for Croatia to
strengthen its democratic institutions.
	   Both Tudjman and the pope spoke of Croatia's long Catholic
history, with John Paul referring to persecution under the Romans,
the Ottoman occupation and ``the terrible period of Communist
repression.''
	   The Vatican was one of the first countries to recognize an
independent Croatia. Of the country's 4.5 million citizens, the
Vatican estimates 80 percent are Catholic.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street bounced back Friday, halting a
global selloff that knocked nearly 6 percent off the Dow
industrials over the previous three days. But European stocks
closed mostly lower and Asian markets turned in a mixed
performance.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, down 476.31 over the past
three sessions, was off an additional 102.22 in the morning before
rebounding. It closed up 152.16, or by 2 percent, at 7,784.69.
	   Broader indicators also shook off early losses in trading volume
that was higher than Thursday's heavy pace.
	   Even with Friday's gain, the Dow ended the week with a loss of
244.08 points, or 3 percent. It also was 1.6 percent below where it
began the year and was down 16.6 percent, or more than 1,550
points, from its July 17 record of 9,337.97.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With the clock ticking down to
possible NATO airstrikes, Serb authorities scrambled Friday to show
they are complying with U.N. demands to pull back their forces and
bring peace to Kosovo.
	   The ethnic Albanians' political leader called it a false show,
and said NATO strikes on Serbia would be welcome.
	   ``The most critical issue is to stop the war machine of Belgrade
and to protect the people of Kosovo,'' said Ibrahim Rugova, who
long has advocated pacifism to settle the Serb-Albanian standoff in
Kosovo. ``That's an issue of humanity.''
	   In a flurry of moves, the Serbs invited U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to visit the southern Serbian province, issued a new
appeal for talks with ethnic Albanian negotiators, removed a key
police roadblock and showed reporters heavy equipment they said has
been withdrawn.
	   But Annan turned down the offer and the ethnic Albanians
indicated they aren't willing to talk until fighting stops.
	   Britain and the United States, keeping up the pressure on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, warned strongly that the
time to prevent intervention is running out.
	   ``We cannot allow this conflict to spread again and risk what we
stopped in Bosnia starting over again in Kosovo,'' U.S. President
Bill Clinton said.
	   The international furor over the Serbs' eight-month crackdown in
separatist Kosovo has intensified this week, pushing the United
States and other countries to the verge of long-threatened
airstrikes.
	   The Serbs' efforts to crush separatist resistance in the
province, which is populated largely by ethnic Albanians, has
killed hundreds of people and driven an estimated 275,000 from
their homes.
	   Even as the Serbs said this week that they were halting their
action against Kosovo ``terrorists,'' evidence surfaced of at least
two massacres of civilians in the Drenica region within recent
days.
	   Claiming that media reports wrongly portray the situation in
Kosovo, Serb authorities said Annan should come himself to see the
``real situation.'' But Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said the
secretary-general was already receiving reports from U.N. officials
in the area.
	   Late Friday, the independent Beta news agency said Serbia's
Deputy Premier Ratko Markovic had invited an ethnic Albanian
negotiating team to meet as soon as possible to resume the
political dialogue which broke down last May.
	   But Fehmi Agani, chief ethnic Albanian negotiator, said the
letter seemed to be intended to ease some of the increasing
international pressure on Serbia rather than a sincere move.
	   ``I don't see how negotiations can possibly continue at this
point when the fighting in Kosovo has not ceased to this date,''
Agani said.
	   Things were moving on the ground in Kosovo. Serb police removed
a roadblock on the road from Pristina to Pec, a highly visible
symbol of the heavy police presence in Kosovo.
	   At the same time, Serb officials showed reporters heavy police
equipment and weapons they say have been withdrawn from the Kosovo
conflict. Many of the men, they say, have been sent on leave.
	   But Rugova and the ethnic Albanians weren't buying the Serbs'
statements.
	   ``The Serb military forces have not withdrawn from Kosovo, they
have only changed their tactical position,'' Rugova told reporters.
``The situation continues to be grave and dangerous.''
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, reported Serb forces attacked two villages
Friday near Malisevo in southwestern Kosovo, then sent in
reinforcements when KLA rebels showed heavy resistance.
	   It also said 20 more bodies had been discovered in the Drenica
region, some near the site where civilians were massacred last
weekend.
	   For its part, the pro-Serb Media Center said Yugoslav army
border guards came under grenade-launcher fire from inside
Albania's territory near the Pogaj border outpost opposite Prizren,
Kosovo.
	   The top Serbian official in Kosovo lashed out at what he said
were ``daily fabrications of new massacres by the ethnic Albanian
propaganda machine.''
	   Veljko Odalovic, head of the provincial government, accused
world powers of helping terrorists in Kosovo by threatening Serbia
and the Yugoslav Federation.
	   Britain, among the most vocal supporters of NATO action as a
last resort, joined the United States in delivering a strong
warning.
	   ``This is a humanitarian disaster,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair
told Channel 4 TV News in London. ``I believe it will only be
stopped if Milosevic gets the clearest possible message ... namely,
if you carry on doing this, you will face a military penalty.''
	   But Russia's parliament declared any NATO military action taken
without U.N. approval would be considered an ``illegal act of
aggression.''

Doping scandal widens in Italy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Le Soir quoting former player
as saying they were given injections on match days. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Twenty-four players of first-division soccer team AC
Parma were reported Friday to have shown altered blood values in
doping tests in July _ a circumstance that could indicate the use
of the banned drug EPO.
	   According to reports published Friday, virtually all Parma
players had abnormally high levels of red blood cells.
	   That is considered a health risk and may indicate the use of
EPO, a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of red
blood cells.
	   EPO, or erythropoietin, boosts oxygen absorption in the
bloodstream. It is the same substance that several cyclists in the
Tour de France are alleged to have taken.
	   Fabio Cannavaro, an Italian national team defender, was
indicated by news reports as the only Parma player not involved in
the scandal.
	   Results of the tests were found in the medical records of Dr.
Alberto Bargossi, who works with Parma. Bologna Prosecutor Alberto
Spinosa, who is conducing a doping investigation, ordered his
office searched.
	   France's Le Soir newspaper quoted Daniel Bravo, who played for
Parma in 1996-97, as saying that Parma players were given
injections on match days.
	   Players were told they were being given vitamins, Le Soir quoted
him as saying, in an interview to be published Saturday.
	   ``We were told they were vitamins,'' Bravo reportedly said.
``But if you were a substitute you never had to take them.''
	   Several doping investigations began in Italy this summer,
prompted by AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman's public remarks that he was
amazed by the quick muscular development of some players.
	   One investigation, done for the Olympic Committee's doping
commission, ended in August without finding evidence of illegal
drug use, but did find that the use of legal muscle-builders is
widespread.
	   On Thursday, the chief administrator of the lab that allegedly
covered up a failed test by a soccer player was fired.
	   Earlier this week, the scandal led Mario Pescante to announce
his resignation as president of the Italian Olympic Committe.
	   The committee oversees all sports _ amateur and professional _
in Italy. As head of the committee, Pescante became a target for
blame when Italian media reported that sports authorities were
failing to run all the required doping tests on pro soccer league
players.

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ This African kingdom remained in turmoil
Friday after South Africa _ whose troops moved in last week to
crush a military rebellion _ announced new elections would be held
within 18 months.
	   South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said Friday evening
that day-long talks _ mediated by officials from South Africa,
Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique _ between the ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy and opposition groups had resulted in an
agreement to hold elections in 15 to 18 months.
	   But opposition coalition spokeswoman Mamelo Morrison said that
while there was a ``tentative agreement'' to hold elections within
18 months, details had not been agreed upon.
	   ``What your deputy president said was a lie,'' the South African
Press Association quoted Morrison as saying. ``We have not come
anywhere near agreement. This has just put the whole negotiations
into chaos.''
	   After Mbeki made his announcement on television, South African
Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi _ who headed mediation efforts _
acknowledged there was no agreement on whether Prime Minister
Pakhalitha Mosisili's government would remain in power until the
next elections.
	   Mufamadi said that and other outstanding issues would be
discussed when negotiations continued Monday, SAPA reported.
	   The leader of the Basotho National Party, Retshilisitsoe
Sekhonyane, said he was pleased elections would be held within 18
months.
	   ``It will be the right period for properly preparing for this
election,'' he told SAPA.
	   Chaos has been prevalent in this Belgium-sized country since
hundreds of South African troops _ acting on behalf of the Southern
African Development Community _ poured over the Lesotho border on
Sept. 22 to quell an army mutiny and a series of strikes aimed at
overturning the results of the May general elections.
	   Dozens of people were killed, mostly in clashes between South
African and Lesotho soldiers. The intervention sparked a wave of
looting and arson attacks that has left much of the capital,
Maseru, in ashes.
	   The current government, elected by a landslide in the election
which opposition groups claim were rigged, will stay in power until
new elections are held in 15 to 18 months, Mbeki said.
	   ``This important agreement lays a firm basis for the return of
Lesotho to normality,'' Mbeki declared.
	   A regional commission found irregularities in May election but
not enough to warrant overturning the result.
	   ``The Independent Electoral Commission will be reconstituted and
strengthened ... to ensure that these general elections are free
and fair and that all political parties participating in the
elections are assured of a level playing field,'' Mbeki said.
	   Mbeki said Southern African Development Community troops would
remain until Lesotho's security forces ``are able to effectively
discharge their legal and constitutional roles.''
	   Opposition parties will ``cooperate'' with that mission, Mbeki
said. However, he did not specify if they had agreed to cooperate.
	   In addition to the more than 1,000 South African troops, there
are at least 200 from Botswana in this Belgium-sized country of 2
million.
	   About 1,000 opposition supporters gathered outside King Letsie
III's palace while the talks were held at United Nations offices
down the road. Intervention troops warily looked on. No violence
was reported.
	   Refuting claims that 58 of its soldiers had died in the
intervention, the Lesotho Defense Force asserted in a statement
Friday that 18 were killed and nine injured. Nine South African
soldiers have also been killed, according to official figures.
	   The South African Council of Churches, meanwhile, said South
Africa and SADC should accept responsibility for the looting and
arson spree. Initially, businesses owned by followers of the ruling
party were targeted, but it quickly degenerated in a free-for-all
that wrecked the capital and caused an estimated 2 billion rands
(dlrs 350 million) in damage.
	   Neighboring countries should help rebuild Lesotho, the church
group said.
	   Taking a step in that direction, South Africa's National Union
of Mineworkers said Friday it would set up a fund to help rebuild
essential services. Between 80,000 and 90,000 people from Lesotho
work in South Africa's mines, their wages generating most of the
income of this impoverished nation which is surrounded by South
Africa.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council kept up the pressure
Friday on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, turning its
attention to Balkan atrocities committed as far back as 1991 and
deploring Milosevic's failure to turn over people indicted for war
crimes.
	   The council met to discuss the work of the U.N. tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia a day after condemning recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians in the southern Serb province of Kosovo. Serb forces are
trying to crush an independence movement by ethnic Albanians, who
constitute 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   Council members on Friday reaffirmed the tribunal's right to
investigate crimes committed in Kosovo, where recent killings of
ethnic Albanians have sparked an international outcry and threats
of NATO intervention.
	   ``There is no debate within the council that the tribunal has
jurisdiction over events and activities in Kosovo,'' U.S. Deputy
Ambassador Peter Burleigh said, refuting Belgrade's claims to the
contrary.
	   The president of the U.N. tribunal, Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, an
American, briefed council members on what she said was their duty
to enforce their resolutions demanding Belgrade turn over war
crimes suspects from the previous Balkan war.
	   She focused her briefing on three army officers _ Mile Mrksic,
Veselin Slijvancanin and Miroslav Radic _ who have been indicted
for war crimes in the massacre of 260 unarmed, non-Serb men
following the fall of the Croatian city of Vukovar in 1991.
	   McDonald called on the council to issue a resolution to remind
Belgrade that it has a legal obligation to turn the men over.
	   ``It seems to me that the `deploring' and `condemning' language
is helpful, but stronger actions need to be taken,'' McDonald told
reporters.
	   ``I wouldn't specify what particular actions, but it seems to me
that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should be told that the
time now, in fact long overdue, in terms of responding to its
obligations.''
	   NATO troops have only recently begun actively searching out and
arresting war crimes suspects from the Bosnian war. The top two
suspects on the tribunal's most wanted list, however _ former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military
chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic _ have not been arrested.
	   The council's president, Jeremy Greenstock of Britain, said in a
statement that the council ``deplored the continuing noncompliance
by the Belgrade authorities.''
	   The tribunal, which sits at The Hague, Netherlands, was set up
in 1993 to bring to justice those responsible for atrocities during
fighting in the former Yugoslavia. It has indicted 58 suspects and
has 26 in custody.
	   ``The world community has to decide whether they will ignore the
signals that we saw in the early days of the conflict in the former
Yugoslavia,'' McDonald said, recalling the council's indecision in
the early 1990s over the Bosnian war.
	   ``The Security Council will have to decide whether they will
react the same way,'' she said. ``Except that we now have the
opportunity once again to do something about it to make sure that
history does not repeat itself.''
	   In a speech to council members, McDonald said that Belgrade's
reason for harboring suspects _ that the constitution forbids
extraditing citizens _ had no legal basis.
	   ``It is a recognized principle of international law that states
may not rely on their domestic law to thwart their international
obligations,'' she said in closed consultations.

Elfriede Frank, second wife of Anne Frank's father, dies age 93
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Elfriede Frank, who married the father of Anne
Frank and campaigned with him to publicize his daughter's
best-selling wartime diary, has died in London aged 93, the Anne
Frank Educational Trust said Friday.
	   Executive director Gillian Walnes said that Mrs. Frank, known as
Fritzi, died peacefully in her sleep overnight Thursday. She did
not give a cause of death.
	   After World War II, Mrs. Frank helped Otto Frank establish the
Anne Frank House in the Dutch capital, Amsterdam, and was a patron
of the Anne Frank Educational Trust UK.
	   Elfriede Markovits was born in the Austrian capital, Vienna, in
1905. She fled to the Netherlands with her first husband, Erich
Geiringer, and their two children, Heinz and Eva, in 1938 after
Adolf Hitler incorporated the country into Nazi Germany. The family
settled in Amsterdam opposite the Frank family, where Eva become
friends with Anne.
	   Like the Frank family, the Geiringers received a summons to be
transported to work camp in Germany in July, 1942, and went into
hiding. They were betrayed in May 1944 and sent to Auschwitz.
Elfriede's husband and son died in the camp. She and her daughter
survived and were liberated by the Russians in January 1945.
	   On a train returning Auschwitz survivors to the Netherlands
after the war, Eva recognized Otto Frank and introduced him to her
mother. Frank was the sole survivor from his family.
	   ``They helped each other come to terms with their losses. Fritzi
was one of the people Otto consulted as to whether to publish
Anne's diaries,'' said Walnes.
	   The diary, which chronicled how Anne and her family hid in a
secret annex behind a movable bookcase in a house along an
Amsterdam canal, was published in 1947 and became a modern literary
classic and inspired numerous books, films and a hit Broadway
musical.
	   The couple were married in November 1953 and settled in Basel,
Switzerland.
	   A large part of their life after the war was spent informing the
world of the horrors of the Holocaust and Anne's life in Amsterdam.
After Otto's death in August, 1980, Mrs. Frank continued their work
alone.
	   ''She carried on correspondence with children all over the
world. She continued that correspondence right into old age, until
about 3 or 4 years ago,'' said Walnes.
	   Mrs. Frank is survived by her daughter and three granddaughters,
all of whom live in Britain.

Egypt's Ahmed Barada wins Ahram tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's Ahmed Barada defeated Scotland's
Martin Heath 3-2 on Friday to win the third annual Al-Ahram
International Squash tournament.
	   Barada won the 88-minute match 15-7, 15-17, 15-11, 13-15, 15-13.
	   This is the first time Egypt has won the local tournament. The
withdrawal of world champion Jansher Khan of Pakistan about a week
before the tournament eliminated Barada's toughest opponent.
	   In the women's matches, second seed Michelle Martin of Australia
defeated third seed Cassie Jackman of Britain 9-5, 9-3, 9-2.
	   Jackman had defeated top seed Sarah Fitz-Gerald of Australia in
a semi-final.
	   The matches were played in a flood-lit court built especially
for the tournament at the foot of the Pyramids outside Cairo.
	   Prizes at the tournament total dlrs 175,000, making it the
world's richest squash event.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Thousands of Mexicans _ from teen-agers to
elderly mothers _ paid tribute Friday to students and protesters
who died 30 years ago when police and army troops opened fire on a
peaceful democracy demonstration.
	   For the first time since the Oct. 2, 1968, massacre, city
workers lowered flags to half staff _ an order from opposition
leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas who won Mexico City's first mayoral
election last year.
	   The mayor planned to appear at the massacre site, Tlatelolco
Plaza, later Friday. Tens of thousands of people were expected to
march to the plaza from the city's main square, the Zocalo.
	   Police deployed 2,500 officers to control several marches
commemorating the date.
	   Candles and flowers sat at the foot of a monument honoring those
who were gunned down _ the exact number of victims has never been
revealed _ during a peaceful demonstration 10 days before the 1968
Olympic Games.
	   Clara Nadales, 72, wept softly in front of the monument. She
said two of her children _ ages 18 and 23 _ were killed when army
troops and special police squads opened fire on the crowd of
thousands.
	   The army cordoned off the square, chased students through a
nearby apartment complex and collected the bodies. Later, it said
between 30 and 40 people were killed, though international media
placed the death toll at about 300.
	   The Mexican government released some official files on the
massacre this year, but said the army will be allowed to keep its
records secret. The decision has angered rights and student groups,
and frustrated an investigation launched by the nation's first
opposition-dominated Congress here in nearly seven decades.
	   Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, president at the time of the massacre, died
in 1979; then-Interior Secretary Luis Echeverria said in a
television interview aired Friday that he was not responsible for
ordering the army to open fire.
	   ``I think there should have been more openness on the part of
the authorities'' in dealing with the students' demands for
democracy, ``but not the use of violence,'' Echeverria told Channel
40.
	   ``If it is said that I controlled the army, and ordered them to
fire, and I'm responsible for what happened, it wasn't that way,''
Echeverria said.
	   Echeverria succeeded Diaz Ordaz as president. But his role _ and
those of others _ may not be become clear ``for two or three
generations ... when everybody is put in his place (in history),''
Echeverria said.

NATO airstrikes: Something to meet every political need
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With rhetoric heightening at the
United Nations, in Washington and in European capitals over the
plight of ethnic Albanians in the southern Serbian province of
Kosovo, Serbs are becoming more and more convinced of the
inevitability of an allied air assault.
	   NATO, for its part, says it has all the punch it requires, and a
list of targets to fulfill whatever goal its political leaders
dictate.
	   The objective of any NATO military action would be to pressure
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic into ending his bloody
crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists. Hundreds of people
have died since February, and about 275,000 have been driven from
their homes.
	   Although NATO's political leaders have yet to decide whether to
launch a strike, the 16-nation alliance warns it has many options _
and an extensive list of targets. NATO will settle on which to use
only after decisions are made on launching the attack and on what
it should achieve.
	   A swift, short cruise missile attack could be used to convince
Milosevic that NATO means business, stepping up the campaign only
if he persists in continuing his offensive. Another option would be
a massive strike right from the start.
	   Among the targets are small installations, such as radar
stations, as well as airfields and command posts, a NATO source
said on condition of anonymity. Site possibilities aren't limited
to Kosovo province, and even could include targets in Belgrade.
	   That prospect worries residents of the Serb capital, many of
whom are unwilling to divulge their names given the tense
situation.
	   ``I feel shivers just at the thought of it,'' a toothless woman
on a downtown street said. A young man just shrugged his shoulders,
saying ``What can I do but find a safe place to hide?''
	   Srdjan Shaper, a musician and composer in his late thirties,
said he felt fatalistic about the strikes. ``Common people will
suffer most if NATO bombs,'' he said.
	   Serb military experts, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
a first wave likely would concentrate on the Yugoslav air defense
and radar and then move on to airfields and military warehouses.
	   There are more than 600 Yugoslav air defense sites around the
country, and they would be a direct threat to the NATO forces.
	   What they are less sure about is what comes next.
	   That's the same question some of the allies are asking. Initial
objectives would be fixed targets, previously identified and
already in the computers. If that doesn't do the job, what's left?
	   Military men eschew speculation that allied attack aircraft
would then go after individual tanks or mobile artillery pieces.
Doing so would be difficult to achieve in a heavily wooded area, a
NATO military source said. Road convoys, on the other hand, would
be easier.
	   Canada, Britain, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and
Portugal have announced plans to send dozens of warplanes to assist
with any NATO mission in Serbia. The United States has two
squadrons of 44 F-16 fighters based at Aviano Air Base in Italy.
	   The Navy's 6th Fleet is in the Mediterranean, including the
aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower, 18 other ships and about 100
aircraft. Among the ships are a cruiser and four destroyers that
can launch terrain-skimming cruise missiles.

<TEXT>
	   MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ Top seeded Carlos Moya of
Spain defeated Thomas Schiessling Friday to advance to the
semifinals of the dlrs 475,000 dollar Mallorca Open.
	   Moya, who was a clear favorite and a local hero from this
Mediterranean Spanish island, easily beat Schiessling of Austria
7-5, 6-4, in Friday's quarterfinal.
	   On Saturday, Moya will Fernando Vicente of Spain, who defeated
fellow countryman Tomas Carbonell 5-7, 7-6 (8-6) and 6-4 in the
second round. Vicente is ranked 78th in the world.
	   Eighth-seeded Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten took 1 hour,19 minutes
to defeat Sergi Bruguera of Spain, 6-4, 6-4.
	   Bruguera pulled off the biggest shock of the tournament when he
beat fellow countryman Alex Corretja, ranked No.7 in the world, on
Thursday. But Bruguera could not repeat victory against Kuerten, to
whom he already lost in the final of the French Open in 1997.
	   Tomas Muster of Austria beat Germany's Tommy Haas 3-6, 6-3 and
6-4, and will play Kuerten in the semifinals Saturday.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With the clock ticking down to
possible NATO airstrikes, Serb authorities scrambled Friday to show
they are complying with U.N. demands to pull back their forces and
bring peace to Kosovo.
	   The ethnic Albanians' political leader called it a false show,
and said NATO strikes on Serbia would be welcome.
	   ``The most critical issue is to stop the war machine of Belgrade
and to protect the people of Kosovo,'' said Ibrahim Rugova, who
long has advocated pacifism to settle the Serb-Albanian standoff in
Kosovo. ``That's an issue of humanity.''
	   In a flurry of moves, the Serbs invited U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to visit the southern Serbian province, issued a new
appeal for talks with ethnic Albanian negotiators, removed a key
police roadblock and showed reporters heavy equipment they said has
been withdrawn.
	   But Annan turned down the offer and ethnic Albanian political
leaders indicated they won't hold talks until NATO intervenes.
	   ``The bombing of Serb forces and positions is a necessary step
to create conditions for truthful negotiations,'' said the
Democratic League for Kosovo, the leading ethnic Albanian political
party. ``Experience from Bosnia shows Serbia accepts dialogue only
when forced to.''

As hall's doors open, Bird takes a pass on fame
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED after 0000 GMT ceremony &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFF DONN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Massachusetts (AP) _ With three NBA championships,
almost universal respect as one of the game's greatest players, and
now a place in basketball's pantheon, Larry Bird still won't take a
full bow.
	   ``It's not about me playing. It's about me and my team,'' he
said Friday before his induction to the Basketball Hall of Fame.
	   The Boston Celtics great enters the shrine with two other
players _ Marques Haynes of the Harlem Globetrotters and Arnie
Risen, also of the Celtics.
	   Other inductees are coaches Alex Hannum of the 1967 NBA champion
Philadelphia 76ers, Jody Conradt of the University of Texas and
Aleksandar Nikolic of Yugoslavia.
	   Atlanta Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens, inducted as a player in 1989,
was honored again, this time as the NBA's winningest coach. He has
an NBA coaching record of 1,120-908, including a 1979 championship
with Seattle.
	   But it was Bird alone who was besieged at a morning news
conference. Clearly uncomfortable with the hoopla, Bird at times
stared at the ceiling.
	   Along with Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan, Bird and his clutch
shots and breathtaking passes fueled the explosive growth of
contemporary basketball.
	   Through it all, Bird, who grew up outside French Lick, Indiana,
stayed almost enigmatically private. Only on the court did he
compete with the game's most flamboyant and self-promoting stars.
	   ``Everywhere I go, people ask me about my playing days. It seems
like it's getting worse, not better,'' said Bird, now 41 and coach
of the Indiana Pacers. ``Once this is over, I think I can close the
book on my career and look forward.''
	   From his entry in the NBA in 1979 to his retirement in 1992,
Bird averaged 24.3 points, 10 rebounds and 6.3 assists a game. The
6-foot-9 (2-meter) forward led Boston to NBA championships against
Houston in 1981 and 1986 and Los Angeles in 1984. He was a
three-time NBA Most Valuable Player and twice a finals Most
Valuable Player.
	   Voicing worry about the NBA lockout, Bird said he hopes the
outcome will help keep players from too much team hopping.
	   ``I think it's great for the fans to be able to identify with
certain players in certain places,'' he said.
	   Wilt Chamberlain, in Springfield to honor his former coach,
Hannum, said he would pick Bird first, even over Jordan, for a spot
on a personal dream team.
	   ``If you're going to go out with a ... team effort, you want
people to be able to blend in,'' said Chamberlain, who acknowledged
his contrasting solo style of play.
	   Indeed, Bird brought success to every team he joined. When he
was a senior at Indiana State, his team lost only one game: the
NCAA championship to Johnson and Michigan State.
	   With the Celtics, the frontcourt of Bird, Kevin McHale and
Robert Parish dominated through much of the 1980s.
	   Even when his bad back had almost ended his playing days, Bird
won a gold medal in 1992 with the U.S. Olympic team.
	   After five years as a Celtics special assistant, Bird took over
last season as coach of the Pacers. He led them to a 58-24 record,
their best since joining the NBA in 1976. He was chosen Coach of
the Year.
	   He remains a team player as coach, crediting assistants and
players.
	   ``I didn't go out there and turn this team around myself,'' he
said.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ A UEFA Task Force announced Friday a new format
that it is considering for a revamped European Champions' Cup to
counter the launch of a proposed breakaway European Super League.
	   Following 3 1/2 hours of meetings with several of Europe's
biggest clubs, the European Football 2000 Task Force unveiled two
concepts it was considering for a new league that would pay out
600-800 million Swiss francs (dlrs 440-590 million) in total prize
money.
	   ``The winners have the possibility to win between 60-80 million
Swiss francs,'' said UEFA General Secretary Gerhard Aigner. ``It
depends of the format the executive committee chooses next week at
meetings in Lisbon.''
	   UEFA revealed it is considering two different concepts for a
remodeled Champions' League _ one involving 24 teams and another
with 32. The Task Force also proposed to merge the UEFA Cup and the
Cup Winners' Cup into one competition.
	   The 24-team model was the preferred one, UEFA said, since it
involved just 15 match days, more easily shoehorned into an already
tight schedule.
	   The format of a UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup merger had not yet
been developed, but would likely include 114 teams playing in
preliminary rounds followed by knockout matches.
	   The proposals are in response to a Super League conceived by a
Milan-based marketing firm, Media Partners, currently attempting to
lure some of the biggest names in European soccer _ including
Bayern Munich, Ajax, Inter and AC Milan, Manchester United and
Arsenal _ into its new competition with a reported dlrs 1.2 billion
in prize money.
	   Though falling significantly short of the Super League's
jackpot, UEFA was quick to insist its prize money was guaranteed.
	   ``At UEFA we base ourselves on realistic figures and conditions,
which are facts today,'' said Aigner. ``And not on speculations of
what the market might give us tomorrow. So an engagement with UEFA
is risk-free.''
	   In order to finance the revamped league, UEFA said it would
investigate the possibility of Pay per View and Pay TV.
	   ``We must change our concepts,'' Aigner said. ``The present
concept has reached saturation as far as possibilities for
television. TV is already overpaying for rights and we cannot
endlessly stretch them to pay more and more.
	   ``We must look at other alternatives.''
	   Under any new concept, broadcasting contracts and marketing
would remain under UEFA control, Aigner said. UEFA remained
unwilling to allow national leagues to take control of domestic TV
rights.
	   ``We are firmly of the opinion it should be centralized,'' said
Aigner. ``Any league needs to be centralized, otherwise it's the
beginning of disintegration.''
	   Some leagues, however, disagreed.
	   ``It would preferable that each team sell its own rights,'' said
Franco Carraro, president of the Italian league. ``If UEFA insists
on a centralized sale of rights then it must be transparent, and
involve UEFA partners as well as the teams.
	   ``Italy is in favor of European competition remaining under
UEFA's control,'' Carraro concluded. ``But only under these
conditions.''
	   Last week, soccer's world ruling body FIFA said it was ready to
take drastic measures to ensure a spin-off Super League never got
off the ground.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said FIFA was prepared to suspend
national associations whose teams defected to join a Super League.

U.S. envoy meets newly-elected Serb hardliner, moderate leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Robert Gelbard, the top
U.S. envoy for Bosnia, met Friday for the first time with theSerb
ultranationalist leader, who was elected president of the Bosnian
Serb republic in Bosnia's nationwide elections last month.
	   After meeting Nikola Poplasen, Gelbard said the two had a very
long discussion about the Dayton peace agreement.
	   ``On behalf of my government and speaking on behalf of Contact
Group countries, I expressed our strongly held views that we fully
expect ... full compliance with the Dayton peace agreement,''
Gelbard said, adding he had congratulated Poplasen on his victory.
	   ``My government hopes to continue our dialogue with Mr Poplasen,
and we certainly hope that the circumstances will exist so we can
continue the positive collaboration'' the West had during 1988 with
the government of Poplasen's predecessor, Western-backed Biljana
Plavsic.
	   Poplasen's victory came as a blow to Western efforts of
stitching Bosnia's disparate ethnic groups closer together. His
Radical Party is allied with the Bosnian Serb faction backing war
crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic.
	   Western worries that Poplasen would work against the Dayton
peace agreement, which ended the 3 1/2-year Bosnian war, were based
on his record of a paramilitary commander in the war.
	   However, Poplasen pledged shortly after his election,to comply
with the Dayton agreement to the letter and adhere to democratic
rules in office.
	   After meeting Gelbard Friday, Poplasen said he was fully aware
of responsibilities ahead in respecting the Dayton agreement and
``the need to continue positive cooperation with the international
community and Western countries.''
	   ``We shall endeavor to preserve peace, economic and political
stability and the process of democratization,'' the Bosnian Serb
leader told reporters.
	   During Friday's surprise visit to the Bosnian Serb stronghold of
Banja Luka in the country's northwest, Gelbard first met moderate
Socialist Zivko Radisic who was elected Serb member in Bosnia's
three-man presidency.
	   After meeting Radisic, Gelbard said that there had been
important progress during moderate leadership in the Serb half of
the country.
	   ``The U.S. and the rest of the international community have been
able to provide specific amounts of economic assistance and we
certainly hope to continue,'' Gelbard told reporters.

	   WROCLAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish heavyweight Andrew Golota
delighted the first home crowd of his professional career Friday by
crafting a unanimous 10-round decision over aging former champion
Tim Witherspoon.
	   Golota, known for low blows and other dirty tactics, kept it
clean in a bout that started slowly before building in drama and
action toward the end.
	   The judges scored it 99-91, 100-91 and 98-93 for Golota, 30, who
improved to 32-3 with 27 knockouts and raised himself to contender
status again after last year's first-round knockout loss to WBC
champion Lennox Lewis.
	   Witherspoon, 40, fought hard but was unable to land his
trademark overhand right, missing at least seven times and only
glancing Golota with it a few other times.
	   The crowd of more than 5,000 in this southwest Polish city
chanted Golota's name throughout and roared its approval with
almost every punch he threw, whether it landed or not.
	   Neither fighter was hurt, though Witherspoon's jabs bloodied
Golota's nose in the ninth round. Golota fought with extreme
control, staying on the outside and clipping Witherspoon with
frequent short punches that caused little damage but scored points.
	   Only once did his control slip, when he threw a few punches
after the bell to end the fourth round.
	   Both fighters got dlrs 200,000 for the bout, billed as the first
professional heavyweight match staged in formerly communist ruled
Poland.
	   Organizers hoped the fight showed Poland can stage world-class
boxing. Despite high ticket prices _ up to 1,000 zlotys (almost
dlrs 300), more than many Poles earn in a month, the arena was
almost full.
	   Golota, who won a bronze medal at the Seoul Olympics in 1988, is
known more for the three losses in his pro career, which began
after he fled to Chicago in 1990 to escape assault charges from a
barroom brawl in Poland.
	   He was ahead in two matches against former champion Riddick Bowe
in 1996, only to get disqualified both times for low blows. Then
Lewis knocked him out in the first round of a title fight last
year.
	   A chair-throwing brawl in the ring after the first Bowe fight
and a dlrs 5,000 fine for secretly using the painkiller lidocaine
90 minutes before the Lewis fight added to Golota's unsavory
reputation.
	   He returned home for the first time last year to visit his
mother and paid a dlrs 7,000 fine in the assault case. But his
unpredictable behavior has continued, with Golota showing up two
hours late for Thursday's weigh-in.
	   Witherspoon, who held the WBC and WBA titles at different times,
fought his last title bout in 1986, losing a one-round knockout to
James ``Bonecrusher'' Smith.
	   The loss, his third straight, dropped his record to 46-8 and
probably ended any hope he had of gaining one more title shot.

Hundreds celebrate mass wedding to commemorate war with Israel

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ With the pyramids as a backdrop and love
songs wafting through the air, 216 Egyptian couples celebrated
their weddings Friday at a government-sponsored party to mark the
25th anniversary of a war with Israel.
	   The night time revelry, paid for by local businessmen, was held
at a sports stadium covered with giant cutouts of crimson hearts
and flowers. Green, red and blue laser lights flickered overhead.
	   At the start of the celebrations, brides in white wedding gowns
and grooms in dark suits walked arm in arm in a line into the
arena. Relatives and friends packing the stands cheered but their
their voices were drowned by the traditional Egyptian wedding music
blaring from loudspeakers.
	   ``I am very happy that I am with the one I love in a place like
this,'' said Sayed Abdul-Fadeel, 32, a stock broker, as his bride,
Fatima Hussein Mohammed, 25, clung to his arm.
	   Behind them at a distance, the Pyramids of Giza illuminated for
the nightly sound-and-light show towered above the stadium.
	   Like all other couples, Abdul-Fadeel and Mohammed had taken
their vows in private earlier Friday.
	   The couples were seated at tables laid out with eight-tiered
white cakes, juice and food donated by restaurants and hotels. The
newlyweds then took over the dance floor, swinging to disco music
and later Egyptian folk dance songs.
	   The party was organized by the governorate of Giza, the district
outside Cairo where the Pyramids are located.
	   Giza governor Maher el-Gindi told reporters that some Giza
hotels gave away three nights accommodation to some couples while
the others will get to spend their honeymoon at the Red Sea resorts
of Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheik.
	   El-Gindi said several shops in Giza will give gifts to the
newlyweds like beds, refrigerators, heaters and washing machines.
	   The celebrations were part of nationwide festivities marking the
the anniversary of the Oct. 6, 1973 assault when the Egyptian army
crossed the Suez Canal into the Israeli-occupied Sinai peninsula.
	   The crossing restored Egyptian pride in its military after its
humiliating defeat in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and led to the
Egypt-Israel peace accord in 1979.
	   Gov. El-Gindi said the original plan was to host only those
couples born in 1973 but lifted that restriction when many of those
who applied did not meet that criterion.
	   A free wedding is undoubtedly welcome in Egypt where many young
cannot afford the cost of a traditional ceremony in a rented a hall
and the mandatory dinner for scores of guests.
	   Even modest weddings costs far more than an Egyptian's average
monthly income of 300 pounds (dlrs 66).
	   ``The Giza governorate can do something like this. I cannot. I
would never have been able to afford a wedding like this,'' said
Hani Mohammed, a 26-year-old English teacher.
	   But like every wedding, Friday's party was not without hitches.
	   At a rehearsal Thursday, a fight nearly broke out when the
couples were told that they could invite only four and not 10
people as promised earlier. A compromise was reached and each
couple got to invite six.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council kept up the pressure
Friday on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, turning its
attention to Balkan atrocities committed as far back as 1991 and
deploring Milosevic's failure to turn over people indicted for war
crimes.
	   The council met to discuss the work of the U.N. tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia a day after condemning recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians in the southern Serb province of Kosovo. Serb forces are
trying to crush an independence movement by ethnic Albanians, who
constitute 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   Council members on Friday reaffirmed the tribunal's right to
investigate crimes committed in Kosovo, where recent killings of
ethnic Albanians have sparked an international outcry and threats
of NATO intervention.
	   ``There is no debate within the council that the tribunal has
jurisdiction over events and activities in Kosovo,'' U.S. Deputy
Ambassador Peter Burleigh said, refuting Belgrade's claims to the
contrary.
	   The president of the U.N. tribunal, Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, an
American, briefed council members on what she said was their duty
to enforce their resolutions demanding Belgrade turn over war
crimes suspects from the previous Balkan war.
	   She focused her briefing on three army officers _ Mile Mrksic,
Veselin Slijvancanin and Miroslav Radic _ who have been indicted
for war crimes in the massacre of 260 unarmed, non-Serb men
following the fall of the Croatian city of Vukovar in 1991.
	   McDonald called on the council to issue a resolution to remind
Belgrade that it has a legal obligation to turn the men over.
	   ``It seems to me that the `deploring' and `condemning' language
is helpful, but stronger actions need to be taken,'' McDonald told
reporters.
	   ``I wouldn't specify what particular actions, but it seems to me
that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should be told that the
time is now, in fact long overdue, in terms of responding to its
obligations.''

tough opponent, but I thought a lot during the fight and found his
weak spots.''
	   Witherspoon called Golota one of the toughest men he's fought
and a future champion.
	   ``I don't know why he didn't approach me or attack me because
he's strong, he's got a lot of heart,'' said Witherspoon, sporting

Australians decide if they want more taxes, or more jobs

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard has staked
his job and his party's fate on what he calls ``economically
radical'' tax reforms _ simplifying an antiquated tax structure.
	   Australians like the idea of revamping a tax code that has built
up since the 1930s, but whether they vote Saturday to keep Howard
in power rests on their willingness to accept a 10 percent sales
tax.
	   Howard's main opponent, Labor Party leader Kim Beazley, is
promising something far less painful: to create 500,000 new jobs.
And he has used a ``no tax'' promise to pull Labor _ a party
shattered by Howard and the conservatives in 1996 _ close enough to
smell victory
	   ``I still think we're there with a good fighting chance,''
Beazley said Friday. ``If they win, it will only be because they
successfully concealed the real impact of the goods and services
tax.''
	   Beazley has hit Howard hard on the tax increase, reminding
voters the prime minister once promised he ``never, ever'' would
introduce such a tax after voters soundly rejected it in the 1993
national election.
	   Howard defended his plan once again Friday: ``We desperately
need change, even our fiercest critics acknowledge that we need to
have a new system.''
	   Howard has tried to soften the sales tax by linking it to income
tax cuts worth dlrs 7.6 billion a year, and has promised to abolish
a variety of other wholesale taxes. The income tax cuts, however,
are based on an uncertain assumption: that the Australian economy
continue to grow 3.5 percent a year so the federal budget stays in
surplus.
	   The International Monetary Fund this week predicted Australia's
economic growth was likely to be 2.25 percent this year, and 2.5
percent the following fiscal year. Australia's major trading
partners, South Korea and Japan, are in recession.
	   Beazley, meanwhile, has promised to create a half-million jobs
in three years and has called for income tax cuts targeting
low-income earners. His proposed cuts would cost dlrs 1.8 billion,
an amount he says would be affordable even under the IMF's modest
growth projections.
	   Labor and Howard's conservative coalition have been in a dead
heat for weeks, according to the polls. Labor, however, needs to
win 27 seats for a majority in the House of Representatives. Labor
strategists were predicting a gain of 15-20 seats.
	   Currently, Howard's governing Liberal Party and rural National
coalition hold 90 seats, Labor 49, independents 8 and the Northern
Territory's Country Liberal Party 1.
	   Even if Howard retains control there, polls have indicated minor
parties or independents again will hold the balance of power in the
upper house, meaning the government may have to negotiate to get
bills passed.

Judge rules tough anti-terror law illegal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Northern Ireland

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ A judge ordered a suspected IRA dissident
freed from police custody Friday after ruling that new anti-terror
powers enacted in the wake of Northern Ireland's deadliest atrocity
were unconstitutional.
	   High Court Judge Catherine McGuinness ordered Deaglan Lavery,
23, to be released from custody immediately because his lawyer had
been denied access to his client or to police notes of their
interrogation.
	   Her ruling was the first to challenge new anti-terror laws
enacted by the Irish and British governments last month in response
to Irish Republican Army dissidents' bombing of the town of Omagh,
killing 29 and wounding 370.
	   The Irish package permits police to question suspected members
of the dissident gang for up to 96 hours without charge and to bar
lawyers during that time.
	   But McGuinness said Lavery's constitutional rights to counsel
were being violated.
	   Lavery was one of three men arrested Wednesday on suspicion of
handling the stolen car that dissidents packed with 500 pounds (225
kgs) of homemade explosives.
	   Though billed by both governments as an effective response to
the Omagh slaughter, their new laws have yet to produce charges
against a single suspect. Twelve people in British-ruled Northern
Ireland have been arrested but freed, six others in the Irish
Republic.
	   McGuinness' ruling makes it increasingly likely that police in
the Irish Republic will find their determination to hold suspects
beyond 48 hours _ the usual legal limit _ challenged by defense
attorneys.
	   McGuinness, one of Ireland's few female judges, is also among
its most prominent and respected. She moderated a Dublin Peace and
Reconciliation Forum that brought together many of the island's
politicians in the wake of 1994 cease-fires by outlawed
paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.

<TEXT>
	   WROCLAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish heavyweight Andrew Golota
delighted the first home crowd of his professional career Friday by
crafting a unanimous 10-round decision over aging former champion
Tim Witherspoon.
	   Golota, known for low blows and other dirty tactics, kept it
clean in a bout that started slowly before building in drama and
action toward the end.
	   The judges scored it 99-91, 100-91 and 98-93 for Golota, 30, who
improved to 32-3 with 27 knockouts and raised himself to contender
status again after last year's first-round knockout loss to WBC
champion Lennox Lewis.
	   Witherspoon, 40, fought hard but was unable to land his
trademark overhand right, missing at least seven times and only
glancing Golota with it a few other times.
	   The crowd of more than 5,000 in this southwest Polish city
chanted Golota's name throughout and roared its approval with
almost every punch he threw, whether it landed or not.
	   ``I couldn't have done it without the fans,'' Golota said, his
bruised eyes showing the effect of Witherspoon's punches.
	   Neither fighter was hurt, though Witherspoon's jabs bloodied
Golota's nose in the ninth round. Golota fought with extreme
control, staying on the outside and clipping Witherspoon with
frequent short punches that caused little damage but scored points.
	   Only once did his control slip, when he threw a few punches
after the bell to end the fourth round.
	   ``I fought an intelligent fight,'' Golota said. ``Tim was a very
tough opponent, but I thought a lot during the fight and found his
weak spots.''
	   Witherspoon called Golota one of the toughest men he's fought
and a future champion.
	   ``I don't know why he didn't approach me or attack me because
he's strong, he's got a lot of heart,'' said Witherspoon, sporting
a welt below his right eye. ``He can be a great champion, a 100
million dollar man, with support behind him.''

	   TORONTO (AP) _ A plaque was dedicated Friday to help remember
the more than 5,000 Ukrainian-Canadians who were rounded up and
branded ``enemy aliens'' during the First World War.
	   ``It's important to recognize the black days we had in this
country,'' said Toronto Councilman Chris Korwin-Kuczynski.
	   Marsha Skrypuch, author of ``Silver Threads,'' a children's book
based on her grandfather's interment experiences, helped unveil the
plaque.
	   She said she hopes Prime Minister Jean Chretien will keep the
promise he made in his 1993 election campaign to recognize the
tragedy.
	   ``I hope that the government will finally acknowledge what
happened to my grandfather and that it was unjust.''

Report: Soyinka will soon return to Nigeria for visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's most prominent exile, Nobel
laureate Wole Soyinka, will return late next week to his home
country for a brief visit, a Lagos newspaper said Friday.
	   The Guardian said Soyinka would come back for a week to give
lectures and meet with journalists and pro-democracy activists.
	   The report, which quoted unidentified sources close to Soyinka,
came one week after the writer met in New York with Nigerian
military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar. Abubakar told reporters
afterward that he had urged Soyinka to end his exile.
	   Soyinka, however, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Associates of his in Lagos, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said his return had not been definitively scheduled.
	   A spokeswoman for Emory University in Atlanta, where Soyinka
teaches, said he was traveling in Europe and she was unaware of his
plans.
	   Soyinka, who won the 1986 Nobel Prize for literature and has
been in exile for the past four years, said earlier in September
that he was worried about his safety on any trip to Nigeria.
	   The Guardian said the junta would provide security for Soyinka's
visit.
	   The junta recently dropped treason charges against Soyinka _
charges that were filed last year during the rule of the late
dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, and are believed to have been trumped
up in an attempt to silence Soyinka, a vocal critic of the Nigerian
junta.
	   At Abubakar's urging, several exiles have returned to Nigeria in
recent months. The general, who took office after the June death of
Abacha, pledges to return Nigeria to democracy and has freed many
political prisoners.

Rahal takes provisional pole for new Houston race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Bobby Rahal, hoping to make a splash in his last
season as a driver, took the provisional pole Friday in the opening
round of time trials for the inaugural Texaco Grand Prix of
Houston.
	   Rahal got around the 1.527-mile (2.46-kilometer), 10-turn
downtown street circuit in 60.191 seconds, a speed of 91.329 mph
(146.97 kph). That relegated Greg Moore's 91.069 mph (146.55 kph)
to the outside of the tentative front row for Sunday's race.
	   ``I've always loved street tracks,'' said Rahal, at 45 the
oldest driver in the Champ Car series. ``A street track is a
driver's track.''
	   The opening day on the new track was a complete guessing game
for everyone, and it was Rahal, a three-time CART FedEx Series
champion, who was able to come up with the best chassis setup.
	   ``I don't think it does much good to walk around the circuit or
drive around it in a street car beforehand,'' the owner-driver
said. ``The perspective is so much different in a race car.
	   ``But we were fortunate that we had a pretty good car to start
with.''
	   Rahal has 18 career poles, but his last one was in Toronto in
July of 1992, his last championship year. He sat on the provisional
pole in Vancouver in 1993, but wound up starting second in that
race.
	   Rahal's best start this year was second on the street circuit in
Long Beach in April. His best finish so far in 1998 was third in
August at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, a natural terrain road
course.
	   Although all of the drivers predicted the speeds would increase
in the conclusion of qualifying on Saturday, the record is not
likely to climb as high as 100 mph (160.93 kph).
	   Dario Franchitti, who won races earlier this season on the road
course in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, and the street circuit in
Vancouver, was third on Friday at 90.755 (146.05), followed by Max
Papis _ the driver who will replace Rahal in the cockpit next
season _ at 90.699 (145.96).
	   ``The track's not that bad,'' said Franchitti, who has started
on the front row in six of the last eight races. ``First of all,
there's a couple of places to pass and there are a lot of second-
and third-gear corners. It's bumpy in a couple of places.''
	   The biggest complaint from the drivers was directed at the pit
entrance and exit.
	   The entrance to the wide, straight pit lane is narrow and
abrupt, making the crews of Newman-Haas Racing teammates Christian
Fittipaldi and Michael Andretti _ in the last two pit stalls _
uneasy.
	   The pit exit is a narrow, winding funnel that Franchitti said
``is longer than some of the tracks I've driven on.''
	   Alex Zanardi, the reigning PPG Cup champion, had a difficult
day, turning a qualifying lap of 90.227 (145.20), good for 10th,
before sliding into a tire wall.
	   ``I had a problem with the gearbox that made me not stop in time
for the corner,'' the Italian driver said. ``Damage to the car
isn't too bad.
	   ``The circuit is really slippery. But it will get better fast. I
wouldn't be surprised if someone broke one minute tomorrow.''
	   Several other big names did not fare any better than Zanardi.
	   Jimmy Vasser, his teammate and the current series runner-up, was
12th, while two more former CART champions, Andretti and Al Unser
Jr., were 15th and 18th.

Russia skipper shows up late, but happy, for Around Alone race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ``Spend'' in 3rd graf quote is CQ &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLESTON, South Carolina (AP) _ Russian sailor Viktor Yazykov
wasn't going to let a few days keep him from his dream.
	   Yazykov and his new 40-foot (12-meter) yacht sailed out of
Charleston Harbor on Thursday in the Around Alone Race. He was five
days behind his fellow skippers, but just as happy as any
competitor.
	   ``I spend my life to get to this point,'' said Yazykov, 50. ``I
was not afraid of being five days late.''
	   Yazykov was assessed a 271-hour penalty that will be added to
his time when he reaches the race's first stopover at Cape Town,
South Africa.
	   But Yazykov isn't worried about winning, just racing. He grew up
in the Russian fishing village of Sochi on the Black Sea. His
father, a fisherman, was lost at sea when Yazykov was 14.
	   Yazykov fell in love with boating in 1964 when he picked up a
Western sailing magazine that was supposed to be banned in his
country, then part of the Soviet Union. He went to nautical college
and worked with the Soviet fishing fleet in the North Pacific.
	   Almost a decade ago he helped build the vessel Fazisi, a Russian
entry in the 1989-90 Whitbread Race, a predecessor to the
around-the-world race.
	   American skipper Bob Adams went to Sochi and built identical
racing yachts to show that Russia was a good place to do business.
But Adams had to drop out of the event with severe equipment
problems on the trip from Russia to Charleston.
	   Yazykov got in two days before the race began on Sept. 26. He
spent the next week working on his vessel's problems. On Thursday,
after some last minute questions for insurance, Yazykov was ready
to go.
	   ``Sail safe, you've worked hard for this,'' race director Mark
Schrader told Yazykov as he departed.
	   It took more than six years, but Yazykov says he finally reached
his goal.
	   ``I was trying to do my best for my country, to show that you
can do something in Russia, no matter how hard times are,'' Yazykov
said.

NATO airstrikes: Something to meet every political need
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to ADD U.S. statement that attack would come
within two weeks. EDITS to conform. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With rhetoric heightening at the
United Nations, in Washington and in European capitals over the
plight of ethnic Albanians in the southern Serbian province of
Kosovo, Serbs are becoming more and more convinced of the
inevitability of an allied air assault.
	   NATO, for its part, says it has all the punch it requires, and a
list of targets to fulfill whatever goal its political leaders
dictate.
	   The objective of any NATO military action would be to pressure
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic into ending his bloody
crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists. Hundreds of people
have died since February, and about 275,000 have been driven from
their homes.
	   Although NATO's political leaders have yet to decide whether to
launch a strike, the 16-nation alliance warns it has many options _
and an extensive list of targets. NATO will settle on which to use
only after decisions are made on launching the attack and on what
it should achieve.
	   The Clinton administration said Friday that strikes would come
within two weeks unless Milosevic meets all U.N. demands in halting
his assault on ethnic Albanians.
	   A swift, short cruise missile attack could be used to convince
Milosevic that NATO means business, stepping up the campaign only
if he persists in continuing his offensive. Another option would be
a massive strike right from the start.
	   Among the targets are small installations, such as radar
stations, as well as airfields and command posts, a NATO source
said on condition of anonymity. Site possibilities aren't limited
to Kosovo province, and even could include targets in Belgrade.
	   That prospect worries residents of the Serb capital, many of
whom are unwilling to divulge their names given the tense
situation.
	   ``I feel shivers just at the thought of it,'' a toothless woman
on a downtown street said. A young man just shrugged his shoulders,
saying ``What can I do but find a safe place to hide?''
	   Srdjan Shaper, a musician and composer in his late thirties,
said he felt fatalistic about the strikes. ``Common people will
suffer most if NATO bombs,'' he said.
	   Serb military experts said on condition of anonymity that a
first wave likely would concentrate on the Yugoslav air defense and
radar and then move on to airfields and military warehouses.
	   There are more than 600 Yugoslav air defense sites around the
country, and they would be a direct threat to the NATO forces.
	   What they are less sure about is what comes next.
	   That's the same question some of the allies are asking. Initial
objectives would be fixed targets, previously identified and
already in the computers. If that doesn't do the job, what's left?
	   Military men eschew speculation that allied attack aircraft
would then go after individual tanks or mobile artillery pieces.
Doing so would be difficult to achieve in a heavily wooded area, a
NATO military source said. Road convoys, on the other hand, would
be easier.
	   Canada, Britain, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and
Portugal have announced plans to send dozens of warplanes to assist
with any NATO mission in Serbia.
	   In Washington, Secretary of Defense William Cohen dismissed a
report that NATO would wait at least two weeks to take any action
against Milosevic.
	   ``I believe action, if it's required, will take place before
that time _ that there will not be a two-week hiatus between now
and the time that would be necessary to provide relief for the
people who are currently suffering,'' Cohen said.
	   The United States has two squadrons of 44 F-16 fighters based at
Aviano Air Base in Italy, and the Navy's 6th Fleet is in the
Mediterranean. The fleet includes the aircraft carrier USS
Eisenhower, 18 other ships and about 100 aircraft. Among the ships
are a cruiser and four destroyers that can launch terrain-skimming
cruise missiles.

Duchess tells of her love for her mother, newspaper says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Duchess of York has said that ''a light has
gone out of my life,'' after the death of her mother in a road
crash earlier this month, The Sun newspaper reported Saturday.
	   ''There will always be a shadow of darkness, but I have
memories: memories of her love and laughter and the courage she
showed during the lowest moments of her life,'' The Sun quoted the
38-year-old duchess, former wife of Queen Elizabeth II's second
son, as saying in an interview with the tabloid newspaper.
	   Susan Barrantes, the duchess's mother, died Sept. 19 when the
car she was driving collided with another car near her estate El
Pucara, 310 miles (500 kilometers) southwest of Buenos Aires.
Barrantes settled in Argentina in 1975 with her second husband,
Argentine professional polo player the late Hector Barrantes.

Egypt's Ahmed Barada wins Ahram tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's Ahmed Barada defeated Scotland's
Martin Heath 3-2 on Friday to win the third annual Al-Ahram
International Squash tournament.
	   Barada won the 88-minute match 15-7, 15-17, 15-11, 13-15, 15-13.
	   This is the first time Egypt has won the local tournament. The
withdrawal of world champion Jansher Khan of Pakistan about a week
before the tournament eliminated Barada's toughest opponent.
	   In the women's matches, second seed Michelle Martin of Australia
defeated third seed Cassie Jackman of Britain 9-5, 9-3, 9-2.
	   Jackman had defeated top seed Sarah Fitz-Gerald of Australia in
a semi-final.
	   The matches were played in a flood-lit court built especially
for the tournament at the foot of the Pyramids outside Cairo.
	   Prizes at the tournament total dlrs 175,000, making it the
world's richest squash event.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON_ A final batch of evidence from Kenneth Starr's
investigation portrays President Bill Clinton's worried response
the night that news of his affair with an intern spilled onto the
Internet. In testimony made public Friday, Oval Office secretary
Betty Currie said the president woke her up with a telephone call
late that night, probably after midnight, and said ``something
would be in The Washington Post'' and ``it was not good.'' ``Do you
think you can reach Monica, see what's happening?'' the president
asked her. Mrs. Currie said she placed a page asking Monica
Lewinsky to call. But she didn't hear from the young woman until
the next morning, Jan. 19, when Ms. Lewinsky said only, ``I can't
talk to you'' and hung up. (US-CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ With the clock ticking down to possible
NATO airstrikes, Serb authorities scrambled Friday to show they are
complying with U.N. demands to pull back their forces and bring
peace to Kosovo. The ethnic Albanians' political leader called it a
false show, and said NATO strikes on Serbia would be welcome. ``The
most critical issue is to stop the war machine of Belgrade and to
protect the people of Kosovo,'' said Ibrahim Rugova, who long has
advocated pacifism to settle the Serb-Albanian standoff in Kosovo.
``That's an issue of humanity.'' (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   SYDNEY, Australia _ Prime Minister John Howard has staked his
job and his party's fate on what he calls ``economically radical''
tax reforms _ simplifying an antiquated tax structure. Australians
like the idea of revamping a tax code that has built up since the
1930s, but whether they vote Saturday to keep Howard in power rests
on their willingness to accept a 10 percent sales tax. Howard's
main opponent, Labor Party leader Kim Beazley, is promising
something far less painful: to create 500,000 new jobs. And he has
used a ``no tax'' promise to pull Labor _ a party shattered by
Howard and the conservatives in 1996 _ close enough to smell
victory. (AUSTRALIA-ELECTION)
	   ZAGREB, Croatia _ With rock bands, giant screens and tens of
thousands of people on the streets, Croatia welcomed Pope John Paul
II on Friday as he came to honor a World War II cardinal held as a
hero by Catholics but accused by Serbs of sympathizing with the
Nazis. It was John Paul's second visit to the country, considered
by the Vatican a Catholic bastion in the Balkans. When he first
came in 1994, the Balkans war was still raging following the
breakup of Yugoslavia. (CROATIA-POPE-MARTYR)
	   RIGA, Latvia _ Whether to make citizenship easier for the
country's huge ethnic Russian population is the top issue for most
Latvians voting in Saturday's elections. In the third national
election since Latvia broke with the Soviet Union, the electorate
will pick a new slate of deputies to the country's 100-seat
parliament, the Saeima. But a simultaneous referendum has drawn
most attention in the voting run-up and which has driven the
election campaigns of most of the 21 parties and alliances seeking
seats. (LATVIA-ELECTION)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip stocks bounced back Friday, reversing
course in the midst of a third day of heavy selling fueled by
disappointment over the Federal Reserve's cautious response to the
global economic crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average rose
152.16 _ or by 2 percent _ to 7,784.69 after swinging from a
102-point loss to a 185-point gain. (US-CLOSING STOCKS, WORLD
MARKETS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The unemployment rate rose to 4.6 percent and
job growth slumped to its lowest level in nearly three years in
September as the global economic crisis spread and deepened. The
seasonally adjusted rate, up from 4.5 percent during the three
previous months, was the highest in six months, the Labor
Department said Friday. It had hit a 28-year low of 4.3 percent in
April and May. Employers added only 69,000 jobs to their payrolls
last month, down from 309,000 in August and the weakest figure
since a blizzard in the Northeast forced businesses to cut payrolls
in January 1996. The weak growth reflected an unusually small
increase in services and job losses in manufacturing and
construction.(US-ECONOMY)
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Cargill Inc., the world's largest grain
trader, has suffered financial losses from its operations in
troubled Russian markets. The company won't specify the amount of
the losses by its financial unit, but a senior official confirmed
that they have been ``significant.'' Several observers with
knowledge of Cargill Financial's activities in Russia estimate that
the damage could run to dlrs 200 million _ equal to almost half of
Cargill's entire profit for its most recent fiscal year _ the Star
Tribune reported Friday. Cargill is the largest privately held
company in the United States with 80,000 employees in 65 countries.
(US-CARGILL-RUSSIA)
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French government and Renault SA chairman Louis
Schweitzer denied a newspaper report Friday that the French auto
maker would merge with a foreign partner. The Finance Ministry
``denies any plans by the state to disengage in any form from
Renault's capital,'' the ministry said in a statement. The French
government has a 44.2 percent stake in the company, which was once
entirely state-controlled. Schweitzer said Renault would try to
keep costs low with small-scale industrial partnerships. ``There is
no project for a big capitalistic marriage for Renault, but there
is a development strategy: We want to double our production to four
million vehicles a year by 2010, and that's exactly what we're
going to do,'' the company chairman told French radio station
France Inter. (FRANCE-RENAULT)
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Chaos is being created in European stock markets
by uncertainty over the future impact on banks and financial
institutions of exposure to troubled hedge funds, analysts said
Friday. ``I think at the moment, people are tending to exaggerate
the amount of expected losses,'' said Jean-Pierre Beguelin, chief
economist at Pictet banking group in Geneva. ``People become very
cautious after being very adventurous.'' He said the marketplace
would suffer a lack of confidence for a while because of losses
incurred from exposure to the private investment partnerships. An
unsettling week for European banks culminated Friday in the
resignation of UBS AG chairman Mathis Cabiallavetta and three other
top executives of the Swiss banking giant. (EUROPE-HEDGE FUNDS)
	   PALO ALTO, California (AP) _ Hewlett-Packard Co. on Friday
announced plans to cut up to 2,500 jobs, or 2 percent of its
workforce, becoming the latest high-tech business to slash costs
due to the Asia slump and slowing demand for personal computers.
The big maker of computers, printers and high-tech accessories had
already announced a dlrs 150 million restructuring charge this
quarter to pay for belt-tightening measures. Hewlett-Packard said
it expects 2,500 of its 127,200 workers to accept voluntary
severance offers, including about 800 in Silicon Valley.
Hewlett-Packard also is moving some employees and manufacturing to
less expensive sites, closing most of its facilities during the
December holidays, curbing new hiring and reducing expenses such as
travel. (US-HEWLETT-PACKARD-JOB CUTS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Bills that would provide at least 10 trillion yen
(dlrs 74 billion) in taxpayer money to help Japan over a major
economic stumbling block _ its mass of bad loans _ passed
Parliament's lower house Friday. With Japan under pressure to
reverse its recession and help Asian economic recovery, the bills
are a major victory for Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and ended weeks
of dispute between the ruling party and the opposition. They are
virtually guaranteed to pass the upper house next week and become
law. (JAPAN-BANK BILLS)

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ An airplane carrying tourists to see
the world's highest waterfall crashed in the Amazon jungle Friday,
killing the co-pilot and injuring 26 passengers and crew members.
	   The DC-3 operated by the Venezuelan airline Servivensa had flown
by Angel Falls and crashed as it was approaching a runway in
Canaima National Park, 700 kilometers (400 miles) southeast of
Caracas. Officials said one of the airplane's engines failed.
	   The passengers included 14 people from Uruguay and two each from
the United States, Britain, Germany and Venezuela. Officials did
not immediately release their names.
	   The airplane had left from the city of Puerto Ordaz in eastern
Venezuela an hour before the accident.
	   Canaima National Park also is home to mysterious flat-topped
mountains that inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic adventure
novel ``The Lost World.''
	   ___
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ An ex-director of a state-owned
munitions company was arrested Friday in connection with alleged
illegal arms sales to Ecuador and Croatia.
	   Judge Marcos Aguinsky ordered the arrest of former Fabricaciones
Militares director Luis Sarlenga on charges of dealing in
contraband, the Diarios y Noticias news agency reported.
	   Authorities are looking into a 1991 weapons shipment to Panama
that was later diverted to Croatia, in violation of a United
Nations arms embargo.
	   Also under investigation is a shipment to Ecuador during its
1995 border war with Peru. Argentina was one of the countries
helping to negotiate a peace settlement to the war.
	   The government has denied any wrongdoing, saying it was deceived
by weapons dealers.
	   ___
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Hurricane Georges was both destroyer and savior of
Cuba's crucial sugar harvest, Cuban officials said.
	   In a preliminary report on the storm's effects on sugar, the
government said heavy rains could help speed up crop growth. But
there were also losses, the Communist Party's daily newspaper,
Granma, reported Thursday.
	   It said winds and rain crushed 1.56 million acres of sugar cane.
Another 498,000 acres of cane were flooded but most have since been
drained and the plants should survive.
	   Thousands more acres of cane affected by drought have recovered
with Georges' rains, and the additional water could allow the
planting of even more sugar, the report said.
	   Hurricane Georges killed more than 400 people in its sweep
across the Caribbean.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A mayoral candidate from Mexico's ruling
party has been jailed after federal agents found 660 pounds (300
kilos) of marijuana in his home near the border with Texas.
	   The agents, acting on a tip Thursday, found 64 packets of
marijuana at the home of Artemio Canales Diaz, a local official of
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, Mexico City newspapers
reported Friday.
	   Canales is the party's mayoral candidate for Oct. 25 elections
in Ciudad Mier, in Tamaulipus state across the border from Roma,
Texas.
	   Police also arrested four alleged accomplices.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Thousands of Mexicans paid tribute Friday to
students and protesters who died 30 years ago when police and army
troops opened fire on a peaceful democracy demonstration.
	   For the first time since the Oct. 2, 1968, massacre, city
workers lowered flags to half staff _ an order from opposition
leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas who won Mexico City's first mayoral
election last year.
	   Police deployed 2,500 officers to control several marches
commemorating the date.
	   Candles and flowers sat at the foot of a monument honoring those
who were gunned down _ the exact number of victims has never been
established _ during a peaceful demonstration 10 days before the
1968 Olympic Games.
	   The army said between 30 and 40 people were killed, but reports
put the death toll at about 300.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A mudslide caused by heavy rains killed one
man and injured his wife and two daughters Friday in northern
Mexico, government news agency Notimex reported.
	   A hillside collapsed near Aguamilpa, a village in the state of
Nayarit, sending rocks and mud onto the family's home. State civil
protection authorities identified the victim as Emeterio Diaz
Gonzalez, 26.
	   His wife, Lucia Ruiz Salvador, and their daughters Alma and
Judith suffered minor injuries, the report said.
	   ___
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Neither the government
nor Indian rebels are showing the political will to use upcoming
Chiapas state elections to bring peace to the region, a watchdog
group said Friday.
	   Heavy troop movement in the north and jungle areas, and the
continued presence of pro-government paramilitary groups throughout
the conflict zone, will prevent thousands of people from voting in
Sunday's state elections, the non-partisan Civic Alliance said.
	   In addition, leaders of the Zapatista National Liberation Army
have ordered supporters to stay away from balloting for county
authorities and the state legislature.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The accidental release of a cloud of natural
gas has sickened at least 60 people, mainly school children, near a
processing plant in the eastern Mexican port city of Veracruz,
state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos said.
	   An ``operation problem'' caused the gas to escape during a
pipeline renovation project Thursday. The cloud then drifted toward
a nearby primary school, Mexico City newspapers said.
	   The Red Cross reported that 72 children were treated for gas
inhalation, the daily Reforma said. The oil company, known as
Pemex, said 60 people suffered ``minor discomfort.''

Tabloids: Queen Elizabeth II's second son says that royal courtiers
</HEADLINE>
lied to the media

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Palace courtiers and royal spokesmen and women
``routinely'' lied to the press for two decades, Queen Elizabeth
II's second son Prince Andrew has said, tabloid newspapers reported
Saturday.
	   In an interview with reporters from Britain's tabloid press,
Andrew said that the royal family was now trying to reform itself
and become more open.
	   ``We are trying to make it better,'' The Mirror quoted Prince
Andrew, 38, as saying while on a royal visit to Malta.
	   The Mirror reported that Prince Andrew's remarks reflected the
time when Buckingham Palace spokesman consistently denied reports
that the marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana was in
trouble.
	   After the death of Princess Diana in a Paris car crash in Aug.
1997, the queen said that lessons would be learned from her open
and populist style.
	   The Prince, a Royal Navy officer and former husband of Sarah
Ferguson, said it was difficult to convince journalists that the
royals had changed, the tabloids said.
	   ``The difficulty now is trying to convince you ... that what you
are being told is the truth. You cannot believe you are being told
the truth because for the last 20 years you probably haven't
been,'' The Sun quoted Prince Andrew as saying.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ If Bosnia does not take the
necessary measures to update its computer systems, all might crash
on Jan. 1, 2000, jeopardizing some of the U.S. dlrs 500 millions
invested in the country, according to the World Bank.
	   The ``Millenium Bug'' could also create severe disruptions in
key sectors such as power, telecommunications, health, social
welfare, wage and pension payments, the financial organization said
in a statement Friday.
	   The statement followed a recent visit to Sarajevo by Prabhat
Garg, the Year 2000 Coordinator for the World Bank's Europe and
Central Asia region.
	   The Bosnian Council of Ministers said it plans to establish a
state coordination committee, which, with the help of the World
Bank staff, will develop an action plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina to
deal with the problem.

	   CONDOM, France (AP) _ The southwestern region of Armagnac, known
for its liqueur, foie gras and the Three Musketeers, has another
attraction _ a town with a name that triggers snickers.
	   Signs marking Condom's town limits draw tourists snapping
photos, if the signs haven't already been ripped off as souvenirs.
	   Don't get mad, get famous! After visitors kept asking a local
pharmacist for his shop's stamp on condom boxes, he decided there
was notoriety _ and money _ to be made off the town's name, the
English word for ``un preservatif.''
	   Why not a condom museum? The pharmacist, Gerard Dubrac, pitched
the idea to town officials about five years ago. ``At first they
laughed,'' he says.
	   Two years later, Dubrac was elected mayor.
	   The museum, he says, will be more than a freak show of models
from way back, but a conference center on safe sex in a country
where condom use is dangerously neglected.
	   ``It's not a museum, in precise terms,'' says the 45-year-old
father of two. ``It's a research center.''
	   Call it what you want, but the main draw will be displays of
hundreds of items, including a turn-of-the-century condom made of
thick rubber donated by the condom makers Durex.
	   It won't be the first museum with condoms. There's a History of
Contraception Museum outside Toronto. But Mayor Dubrac's got the
town name.
	   ``There's business to do,'' he says. ``You can make hats,
objects, whatever you want.'' Already, Condom sells plastic copies
of its real town signs, which disappear periodically.
	   Dubrac has produced a 12-page glossy pamphlet with blueprints
for a three-story museum. Costing about 30 million francs (dlrs 5
million), it would have exhibition space, a 400-seat auditorium and
a library.
	   Dubrac this year won government support for the first ``National
Condom Days'' July 3-4.
	   The event included Condom's first condom exhibit, with posters,
archive footage of TV commercials and World War II films on how
troops can avoid syphilis. It travels to Paris in October, at the
Centre Info-Sida (AIDS Information Center.)
	   The exhibit was coupled with a condom colloquium in nearby
Toulouse, the kind of event Dubrac hopes his center will host.
Medical experts discussed the condom's history, manufacture and
use.
	   French officials see the museum as a way to boost condom use.
	   ``Youth are neglecting the condom,'' was a front-page headline
this month in the daily Le Parisien, citing figures that only one
in four young adults uses condoms.
	   But funding has been an uphill battle. For the current exhibit,
the Health Ministry donated 50,000 francs (dlrs 8,200). Durex
provided materials but has yet to commit funds to build the museum
as it waits to see which other partners join in.
	   The name ``condom'' may well have originated in the town,
contends Dubrac, basing his claim on an 18th-century French book
called ``History of the Skin Trade.''
	   The book says a professor Le Baudroyeur made condoms during the
early 1700s. Protestants in Armagnac circulated a rumor that one of
the professor's customers was Bishop Bossuet in the town of Condom.
	   Many of the 7,700 residents of Condom are skeptical that the
museum will come to fruition, but they like the idea.
	   ``If it attracts tourists, that's great,'' said Philippe
Sabaron, 31, a video shop owner.

350,000 furry fliers lure tourists to Carlsbad Caverns

	   CARLSBAD, New Mexico (AP) _ The breakfast menu at Carlsbad
Caverns National Park calls for biscuits, eggs and juice _ with
hundreds of thousands of swarming bats on the side.
	   Each morning as the sun rises, the muddy-brown bats zip back
into the caverns after a night of feasting on mosquitoes, moths and
June bugs. Wings tucked, the furry fliers whistle through the air
in free fall at speeds of up to 60 mph (96.5 kph).
	   The caverns' 350,000 bats were the guests of honor at the first
International Bat Festival in September.
	   The celebration of one of the world's smallest mammals included
a sunrise breakfast with the bats, music, a street dance, a parade
featuring batcycles and batmobiles, and lectures that explained
that bats aren't ``scary nasty creatures'' but beneficial animals
that control the insect population, said Tracy Hill, executive
director of the Chamber of Commerce.
	   It was also a bid by the city of 28,000 just a few miles
(kilometers) from the Texas border to boost tourism.
	   Every night, just after sunset, the bats fly out of the cave and
gently circle upward, gaining enough altitude to swoop over a tall
limestone wall protecting the cave's main entrance. During the
night's foray, they collectively devour up to three tons of insects
on neighboring farm fields.
	   The bats rustle through the desert night sky, occasionally
chirping as they head out, and leaving behind a peculiar acrid
odor.
	   It makes for an exotic vacation.
	   ``We thought the kids would enjoy it,'' said Mike Scott of
Atlanta, who admired the bats with his wife and three children at a
bat breakfast in August. ``It's spectacular. It's just amazing to
see this.''
	   Although the sunset exodus regularly draws hundreds of visitors,
few rise at dawn to see the dramatic return. Park officials started
the annual Bat Flight Breakfast 42 years ago as a way to lure
sleepy tourists and residents to the show-stopping return.
	   ``We've heard they dive bomb,'' said Colby Parker of Houston,
who was among some 500 who attended this year's breakfast.
	   Do they ever.
	   A small child giggled with delight and pointed a small finger at
the peculiar creatures that whizzed overhead.
	   ``It's neat to see them like that,'' said Steve Kovacs of
Carlsbad, who watched the spectacle from the bat flight
amphitheater at the entrance to the caves.
	   From March through October, thousands of the animals cling to
the ceiling in Bat Cave a half mile (one kilometer) from the
caverns' main entrance. Visitors aren't allowed in the bat abode,
which hovers at a chilly 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 C), but can tour
other parts of the caves.
	   The small mammals spend their summers in the caverns, then head
south to Mexico for the winter.
	   The bats actually led to the discovery of the cave. Early
explorer Jim White stumbled onto the caves 100 years ago, thinking
smoke was pouring from the entrance.
	   More than 30 miles (48 kilometers) of caverns have been mapped,
and researchers are uncertain how much more there is.
	   Today, parts of the caverns are open for self-guided as well as
group tours. Landscape lighting highlights stunning stalactites and
stalagmites, and other distinctive rock formations. Sounds echo off
the cavern walls in a peculiar way and the cool air is thick with
humidity, all combining to create the feeling of another world.
	   Visitors can even grab a bite to eat at a coffee shop 750 feet
(228 meters) underground before zooming back to the surface in an
elevator.

Tour shows how magic is made in Walt's world

<TEXT>
	   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Florida (AP) _ There is a place at Walt Disney
World where Snow White can be seen munching a popsicle, where a
hairdresser perfects Cinderella's coif and where a mammoth
warehouse stores extra life-size heads of Mickey Mouse, Goofy and
the rest of the gang.
	   For dlrs 185 per person, tourists can visit this backstage
Disney and learn that it takes a lot of hard work, and not just
pixie dust, to create ``the happiest place on earth.'' Disney
barely publicizes the tour, which goes out six-days-a-week and has
a six-month waiting list.
	   Each of the theme parks have so-called backstage areas, where
many of Walt Disney World's 50,000 workers can change into their
costumes, eat and take breaks. Backstage also is where the
mechanics of the rides can be seen and workers monitor some
visitors on close-circuit television to make sure they're surviving
some of the more harrowing rides.
	   The other day, 20 Disney buffs boarded a plush, air-conditioned
bus to start the adults-only tour.
	   ``I know you are all real serious Disneyphiles,'' gushed David
Buchman, the guide. ``Behind here are the real magicians that put
on the show.''
	   But first, a few rules. No photos can be taken backstage,
Buchman said. ``We want to preserve the integrity of Walt Disney
World for those guests who can't see this.''
	   The all-day tour, which generally attracts 15 people a day,
covered three of Disney World's four theme parks; the newly opened
Animal Kingdom was bypassed. The backstage areas of Epcot, built in
the shape of a horseshoe, and Disney-MGM are literally behind the
parks. What might appear to be Epcot's The Living Seas on one side
looks like a big warehouse from the backstage area.
	   The backstage area is underground at the Magic Kingdom, which
was built in 1971 as Disney's first Florida theme park. Because
Florida's topography precluded building basements, a floor of
hallways, known as ``the tunnels,'' was built on the first floor.
The actual theme park was built on top of it. The tunnels have
changing rooms, food machines and pipes overhead that suck out
garbage from the theme park.
	   In the tunnels, workers dressed in Frontierland costumes or
clutching a Goofy head scurry from a costume check-in counter,
where many of the resort's 2 1-2 million costumes are stored, to a
dressing room to change. Workers have to check back their costumes
after each shift.
	   They might stop by hairstylist Ivan Wolman's make-up room for a
touchup, applying make-up that they can get only from Disney to
ensure uniformity.
	   Then it's up a flight of stairs or an elevator to the Magic
Kingdom. The idea of the tunnels is to prevent a worker from
Liberty Square popping up in Fantasyland.
	   In warehouses, out of sight of everyday tourists, artisans
repair or build damaged animatronics floats and costumes. There are
shelves filled with life-size Mickey Mouse heads, welders putting
together seats for the new Buzz Lightyear ride and an electronics
shop where technicians repair decapitated animatronics from the
``It's a Small World'' ride.
	   ``They're open 365 days a year and they take a lot of abuse,''
said Isle Voight, Disney's resident carousel expert, about the
rides as she painted a horse from Cinderella's Golden Carrousel.
	   At Disney-MGM Studios, the backstage tourists spend an hour
learning how to sketch Goofy and paint animation cells of Mickey,
Minnie, Goofy and Donald while watching movie clips from ``The Lion
King,'' ``Aladdin'' and ``Pocohantas.'' At EPCOT, they watch how
old railroad tracks pull a stage carrying robotic figures of Ben
Franklin and Mark Twain up to an audience for The American
Adventure Show.
	   The backstage visitors ranged from grandmothers to
20-somethings. All had a love of Disney and came to Walt Disney
World on a regular basis. Several had booked reservations a year in
advance.
	   Buchman deflated a few old wives' tales about Walt Disney World.
	   Contrary to urban myth, Walt Disney's frozen head is NOT buried
under Cinderella's Castle, the hotel rooms at the Contemporary
Resort do not slide out and there is more than one person who plays
Mickey Mouse, Buchman said.
	   ``What do you mean, there's more than one Mickey Mouse?'' joked
a bearded Allen Sutcliffe in a crestfallen voice. Sutcliffe, of
Poughkeepsie, New York, who was taking the tour with his wife,
Laura, was loathe to admit it but he loved Disney as much as their
twin 8-year-old boys, Mrs. Sutcliffe said.
	   For Barbara Sparkman, who works at a Disney store in Wichita,
Kansas, the tour was almost a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.
	   ``All those underground tunnels,'' said Mrs. Sparkman, who came
with her husband and daughter. ``Everybody in the store always
talked about them.''

	   CIMARRON, New Mexico (AP) _ Some ghost towns are more ghostlike
than others _ just scatterings of debris and faded memories. But
some can still be saved.
	   It is too late for the timber town of Ring _ just a couple of
mounds of rock and a few piles of collapsed timbers. The coal town
of Dawson, 18 miles (30 kilometers) east, was dismantled by mining
giant Phelps Dodge in 1952. Only foundations remain.
	   Several gold-mining and logging towns across a 20-mile
(32-kilometer) swath of northern New Mexico are marked only by
rusty equipment fragments. They all died around the same time, 80
to 100 years ago as the gold and timber ran out.
	   In the middle of that swath, seven log houses still stand in the
logging-railroad town of Ponil Park _ but not for long if Mother
Nature stays on track.
	   ``It could go tomorrow, now that the roofs are gone. That's
what's so scary,'' says Jon Young, archaeologist for the Carson
National Forest.
	   Young hopes to save Ponil Park from the fate that befell Ring,
LaBelle, Bonito, Dawson, Anchor, Midnight, Hopewell and many others
that are now gone forever.
	   The Boy Scouts of America, busily restoring similar ruins on the
Philmont Scout Ranch near Cimarron, have offered to help.
	   Ponil Park, 18 miles (30 kilometers) northwest of Cimarron and
16 miles (26 kilometers) south of the Colorado border, already is
getting help from the Scouts. If the town is restored, former
resident Kermit Webster, 88, would like to see it.
	   ``It was a railroad stop there,'' Webster said by phone from his
home in Ventura, Calif. ``Around up the hills, there was lumber
being made. They had flatcars they filled with lumber to go from
Ponil Park to Cimarron.''
	   Webster recalled the sawdust pile where he played as a child
with his little half-sister, Margaret Langridge. He remembers his
mother's vegetable garden, the little schoolhouse, the grocery.
	   ``I had my first bottle of sody pop there,'' Webster said. ``It
was a gift from the man who owned the grocery store.''
	   Webster's stepfather, Harry Langridge, was foreman of the
railroad loading operation and, as such, had the largest log house
in town, with a well just off the porch. But the Langridges didn't
stay long. Webster says they moved to Colorado when he was about 6.
	   Census data suggests Ponil Park had perhaps 100 residents at its
peak. It died in the 1920s.
	   Philmont began using Boy Scout crews to do historic preservation
projects on the private, 138,000-acre (55,847-hectare) Scout ranch
three years ago. Some 20,000 Scouts camped at Philmont this summer.
	   At McCrystal Ranch on the Carson Forest, about 8 miles (13
kilometers) north of the ruins of Ring and Ponil Park, half the
19th-century ranchhouse where John and Annie McCrystal raised six
children has fallen down.
	   ``My God, that just happened over the winter,'' said Young,
visiting the site with Scout leaders. ``It was probably the weight
of the snow and maybe the wind.''
	   Doug Palmer, Philmont's back-country programs manager, suggested
his crews might try salvaging at least part of the McCrystal house.
	   ``If we could get in there and stop it and maybe restore it, I'd
be tickled,'' Young said.
	   Palmer said Scouts might help Ponil Park as well. ``We've got
the labor if he (Young) has got the money. I think it could be
done,'' Palmer said.
	   The Forest Service would supply the materials, and Young said
he's immediately drafting a proposal for state approval and
earmarking the cutting of trees to furnish the logs needed for the
project.
	   Young also would like to see the railroad bridges restored, if
not the trains.
	   The Scouts have placed barriers around the Ponil Park houses to
keep stray cattle from nearby ranches and wild elk from causing
more damage.
	   The roofless walls twist, leaning inward. Bits of rusty
sheet-metal roofing lay wind-scattered or buried in rubble.
	   The Scouts previously did restoration on Philmont sites at
Rayado, Baldy and French Henry. At Baldy, near the summit of the
12,400-foot (3,780-meter) mountain of that name, the scouts have a
museum filled with antique glass and rusted gadgets. At French
Henry, they restored a 19th-century log building. Neither site is
open to the public.
	   For Ponil Park and McCrystal, Young must submit restoration
plans to the state Office of Cultural Affairs. A state
archaeologist, Eric Petersen, says the agency must ensure
renovations are historically accurate.
	   As for Ponil Park, he says, ``I suspect we'll be all for it.
``The only questions we will probably want to ask is what kind of
materials they're going to use, how they're going to do it.''
	   Young and Palmer say Scouts would use timber from the forest and
square off any replacement logs with hand tools just as Ponil Park
settlers did.

South Korean president heads to Japan for `Apology Summit'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan and South Korea share deep common roots in
culture and language _ and a history of military assaults,
colonization and general animosity.
	   When South Korean President Kim Dae-jung steps on Japanese soil
next week for a summit with Japanese counterpart Keizo Obuchi, both
sides hope to move beyond that dark past.
	   Tokyo and Seoul have heralded the four-day visit starting next
Wednesday as a turning point in relations between the two Asian
economic powers and a step toward settling historical differences.
	   To prove it, the two countries have reached a deal on a thorny
fishing dispute and Japan is expected to make its most explicit
apology yet for its harsh 1910-1945 colonization of the Korean
Peninsula.
	   The two sides have good reasons to work together more closely:
the Asian financial crisis and a recent rocket test launch by North
Korea pose troubling threats to regional stability.
	   ``A new type of cooperation between Japan and South Korea is
needed,'' said Kiyokazu Koshida, secretary-general of the
Asia-Pacific Research Center, an independent think-tank in Tokyo.
	   Evidence of that new cooperation came Wednesday with reports
that a Japanese government bank would extend dlrs 3 billion in
loans to small companies in South Korea.
	   Obuchi was to announce the loans by the Export-Import Bank of
Japan while Kim is in town, national broadcaster NHK reported. In
May, the bank lent dlrs 1 billion to South Korean companies to pay
for Japanese imports.
	   South Korea could use the money.
	   It is currently struggling to restructure its economy under a
dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Close cooperation between Tokyo and Seoul would seem natural.
The two share customs and cultural roots and their languages are
very similar.
	   On many fronts, relations between Japan and South Korea are
flourishing. But the two neighbors have some distance to go before
becoming best of friends.
	   At the top of the list of outstanding issues is Japan's rule
over Korea, when Tokyo imposed its language and even Japanese names
on its colonial subjects. Koreans were brought to Japan as slave
labor, and women were forced into prostitution in wartime brothels.
Ethnic Koreans are still treated as second-class citizens in Japan.
	   The hard feelings in South Korea are never far below the
surface. Japanese movies, for example, are banned, and recent
disputes over Sea of Japan islands and the hosting of the 2002
World Cup have triggered emotional protests in South Korea.
	   ``To put it simply, the South Korean people were victims,'' Kim
Suk-kyu, South Korea's ambassador to Japan, said recently.
President Kim ``is hoping Japan will offer a heartfelt apology and
reflect on its history.''
	   Japan has apologized several times in the past, but many South
Koreans feel that all fell short of displaying true remorse.
	   Relations got a boost recently with the reaching of a basic
agreement on a new treaty to set fishing boundaries and quotas
around hotly disputed islands. The treaty is expected to be signed
when Kim comes to Japan.
	   Also high on the agenda will be North Korea's test firing of a
rocket over Japan on Aug. 31. The test rattled Japan and reminded
the country of its vulnerability to attack.
	   South Korea is eager to get Japanese back involved in a U.S.-led
international effort to build two nuclear reactors for North Korea
to replace reactors that could be used to produce weapons-grade
material. Tokyo backed off its financial commitment to the plan
after the missile launch.
	   Kim and Obuchi are also expected to adopt a joint declaration
for a new partnership between the two countries. The South Korean
president will pay a courtesy call on Emperor Akihito and address
parliament.
	   The two sides have also been clear about what will not be
discussed during the visit: Kim's abduction from a Tokyo hotel in
1973, when he was a dissident in self-imposed exile.
	   Kim was taken by sea to South Korea and was set free five days
later. The kidnapping has never been solved conclusively, though
Kim says he was grabbed by South Korean government agents.
	   The crime sparked a serious diplomatic row between Japan and
South Korea, which was patched up a few years later when Seoul made
a vague apology for the action.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Like many 14-year-olds, Sombat longs to
play video games, to try new releases like the ones he recently saw
other teen-agers shopping for at a Bangkok emporium.
	   But these are the stuff of dreams for someone who steals and
begs on the streets, beds down on pavements and sells his body to
foreign tourists. And when he did venture into the video store, the
episode ended like many in his desperate life: he was abused and
driven away by an angry adult.
	   Sombat's fate has been shared by tens of thousands in Southeast
Asia for some time, but those who work with street children say
their ranks are swelling as economic woes sweep the region.
	   ``More children will be forced into the streets to help their
family or to fend for themselves as the economic crisis has shown
no signs of abating,'' Ernesto F. Herrera, a children rights worker
from the Philippines, said at a recent seminar organized by the
European Commission to exchange information and working experiences
among those trying to alleviate the plight of Asia's street
children.
	   In Thailand, where the Asian crisis began in mid-1997, the
government's much-reduced national budget has forced the
termination of a number of government-funded programs for street
children.
	   Chauchan Chongsatityoo, an official of the National Education
Commission in Thailand, said other government and non-governmental
organizations are struggling to keep their operations going.
Countries like Indonesia and Vietnam, once proud of its efforts to
get children off the streets, are facing similar problems.
	   ``To solve the problem of street children, we must alleviate
poverty. But it is more difficult now when we are falling into an
economic crisis and rely on (scarcer) international
resources,''said Vietnam's Labor and Social Affairs Minister Nguyen
Thi Hang.
	   Vietnam has more than 50,000 children living in the streets, of
which some 32,000 live in Ho Chi Minh City. The numbers are
expected to increase, the minister said.
	   The Indonesian capital of Jakarta has, by official estimate,
some 30,000 homeless, with a sizeable percentage of them children.
Similar situations exist in other cities in a country that has been
hit with particular force by the crisis.
	   In the Philippines, there are some 1.5 million working children,
30 percent of whom are homeless and frequently engaged in
prostitution and drug abuse, Herrera said.
	   An estimated 15,000 roam Thailand's streets, joined by an
unknown number of impoverished children who sneak across the
frontiers from neighboring Cambodia and Myanmar, also known as
Burma.
	   ``Solving the problem of street children should be accompanied
by a fight against child labor, prostitution and trafficking which
needs cooperation among countries,'' said Chauchan.
	   Thailand, and more recently Cambodia, have been branded as
playgrounds for foreign pedophiles, preying on youngsters driven
out of homes not only by poverty but parental abuse and breakup of
marriages.
	   Despite the dangers he daily faces, Sombat, who asked that his
full name not be used, says he prefers the streets to his broken
home and to soulless state shelters.
	   He manages 50 to 100 baht (dlrs 1.25 to 2.50) a day from
begging, hardly enough to pay for food, cigarettes and amphetamine
drugs. Sometimes he will steal, but the police _ his No. 1 enemy _
are quick to throw children like him into jail for petty theft or
being a public nuisance.
	   So to make ends meet, he cruises Bangkok's notorious Patpong
Road area at night to offer sex to tourists. Occasionally, he
encounters pedophiles who will film sexual acts he and his fellow
street kids perform.
	   ``Street children are kids who don't love their homes and their
homes don't love them. No child in this world wants to live in the
street,'' the Rev. Joseph H. Maier told the seminar. ``These
children need more open houses, not jails. They should have a place
where they can have bed and meals.''
	   Maier, an American Catholic priest who has worked with Bangkok's
slum dwellers for nearly three decades, provides schooling and
other aid to nearly 5,000 children. He also runs a center for AIDS
patients.
	   At least 120 residents of the center have died of the deadly
virus this year, among them a number of street children.

China set to sign key human rights pact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ China on Monday is expected to sign a key
human rights treaty that provides for freedom of expression,
religion and self-determination, U.N. officials said.
	   The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is one
of two accords seen as key treaties of fundamental human rights.
China has signed the other one _ the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights _ but hasn't ratified it.
	   China, whose human rights record has been widely criticized,
told the top U.N. human rights officer, Mary Robinson, last month
that it planned to sign the political rights treaty before
November.
	   The treaty was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1966 and
went into force a decade later. Since then, 140 countries have
ratified it or agreed to it.
	   The treaty states that all people have the right of
self-determination. It prohibits torture, cruel or degrading
punishment and provides for freedom of movement, thought, religion
and expression, among other things.
	   States that have signed on to the treaty are required to submit
an initial report within one year of ratification, and periodic
reports every five years thereafter.
	   The nonpartisan Freedom House, which promotes liberty and
democracy throughout the world, called Monday's signing a ``cynical
attempt to deceive the west about the true state of religious
repression in the country.''
	   In a statement, it said hundreds of Christians are laboring in
penal camps or under some other form of police restriction for
their faith.
	   ``If Beijing wants to prove its full membership in the
international community and commitment to its laws, it must empty
its religious gulag, allow churches to operate freely and abolish
the hated registration requirement,'' Nina Shea, director of
Freedom House's Center for Religious Freedom, said Friday.

Funk takes a three-shot lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM SALADINO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PINE MOUNTAIN, Georgia (AP) _ Fred Funk shot a 67 to increase
his lead to three strokes after the second round of the dlrs 1.5
million Buick Challenge.
	   Funk, who nearly withdrew with a sore back before Thursday's
opening round, held off the challenge of rookie of the year
candidate Steve Flesch, veteran D.A. Weibring and leading
money-winner David Duval with a 14-under-par 130.
	   The 42-year-old Funk, in his 10th full year on the tour and a
co-leader with Jim Carter after the first day, made two birdies on
his final three holes Friday to give him some breathing room in
bidding for the dlrs 270,000 first prize.
	   Funk would be a lock with a win here for a spot in The Tour
Championship _ only the top 30 on the money list qualify _ later
this month in Atlanta. That event has a whopping first prize of
dlrs 720,000 and a minimum paycheck of dlrs 64,000. He is currently
No. 30 on the money list with dlrs 825,458.
	   ``A win would be great. The top 30 is a big goal,'' said Funk.
``That's why I'm playing here, grinding hard at the end of the
year.''
	   Flesch, who shot a 66, was three shots back at 133, tied with
Weibring, who had a 65.
	   Another stroke back was Duval, who had a 68-134 over the par-72,
7,057-yard (6,450-meter) Mountain View course at the Callaway
Gardens resort. Carter, who had a 71, and Bill Glasson, who had a
65, were also tied with Duval, who has won three tournaments and
dlrs 2,070,283 so far this year.
	   ``I really was conscious of the fact that David Duval was up
there,'' said Funk. ``I think he's the best player in the world
right now, and when he gets on a roll, he's tough to beat.''
	   But, so is Funk on this course 75 miles (120 kilometers)
southwest of Atlanta. He won in 1995 and lost to Michael Bradley in
a five-man playoff in 1996.
	   ``It's a place I'm comfortable with,'' he said. ``I've got a
good record here and I'm looking forward to the weekend.''
	   Funk had six birdies and two bogeys in his round. Flesch, who
has four top-10 finishes and is 35th on the money list at dlrs
720,247, had six birdies and his only bogey on his last hole when
he missed a 4-foot putt.
	   ``I played really good. That was the only one I missed all
day,'' said Flesch, who also would move into the top 30 in earnings
with a win here.
	   ``That would be great. It would exceed anything I expected,''
said the 31-year-old, who qualified for the tour by finishing
fourth in earnings on the Nike Tour last year.
	   Funk, who won earlier this year at the Deposit Guaranty Classic
for his fifth tour victory, had considered withdrawing when his
back acted up Thursday. But a half-hour of physical therapy
loosened it up and he had no problems Friday.
	   The strong field has 19 of the top 30 money-winners, including
Vijay Singh, the PGA champion, who was at 139 after a 70. Defending
champion Davis Love III also was at 139 after a 70. Hal Sutton, who
won last week's Texas Open, had a 66 and was at 138.

Serbs move to evade NATO intervention

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Anxious to avoid NATO airstrikes,
Serb authorities are scrambling to show they are making progress
toward ending the conflict in Kosovo by complying with U.N. orders
to withdraw their troops from the troubled province.
	   But ethnic Albanian political leaders have rebuffed their offer
to hold talks, saying they won't sit down with the Serbs until NATO
intervenes.
	   ``The bombing of Serb forces and positions is a necessary step
to create conditions for truthful negotiations,'' said the
Democratic League for Kosovo, the leading ethnic Albanian political
party, on Friday. ``Experience from Bosnia shows Serbia accepts
dialogue only when forced to.''
	   Low-grade talks between the two sides, which the Serbs say could
lead to restoring some of the autonomy they took away from Kosovo
in 1989, broke off last May.
	   Despite the Serbs' claims that forces have been withdrawn and
fighting is over, there are reports of continuing clashes in the
separatist province of southern Serbia.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, said Serb forces attacked two villages Friday
near Malisevo in southwestern Kosovo, then sent in reinforcements
when Kosovo Liberation Army rebels fought back.
	   For its part, the pro-Serb Media Center said Yugoslav army
border guards came under grenade-launcher fire from inside
Albania's territory near the Pogaj border outpost opposite Prizren,
Kosovo.
	   Besides asking the ethnic Albanian negotiating team to resume a
political dialogue, the Serbs invited U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to visit Kosovo, removed a key police roadblock and showed
reporters heavy equipment they said has been withdrawn.
	   But Annan turned down the offer, and world leaders made their
skepticism clear, keeping up the pressure on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw forces and bring peace to Kosovo.
	   ``We cannot allow this conflict to spread again and risk what we
stopped in Bosnia starting over again in Kosovo,'' U.S. President
Bill Clinton said.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, however, argued the
problems in Kosovo cannot be solved by the use of outside force.
And Russia's parliament declared that any action taken without U.N.
approval would be considered an ``illegal act of aggression.''
	   The international furor over the Serbs' eight-month war in
Kosovo has intensified this week, pushing the United States and
other countries to the verge of long-threatened airstrikes.
	   The Serbs' efforts to crush separatist resistance in the
province, which is populated largely by ethnic Albanians, has
killed hundreds of people and driven an estimated 275,000 from
their homes.
	   Even as the Serbs said this week that they were halting their
action against Kosovo ``terrorists,'' evidence surfaced of at least
two massacres of civilians in the Drenica region within recent
days.
	   After a session of the Yugoslav government in Belgrade on
Friday, officials issued a statement saying the fighting had ended
and blaming continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels.

Pope John Paul II to beatify WW II Cardinal

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Thousands of Croats flocked overnight to
the Marian shrine in Marija Bistrica, where Pope John Paul II was
to beatify on Saturday Croatia's controversial World War II
Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac.
	   It is John Paul's second visit to the country, considered by the
Vatican a Catholic bastion in the Balkans.
	   More than 400,000 people are expected to witness the open-air
beatification ceremony in Croatia's leading shrine to Mary, the
mother of Jesus. The shrine is 25 kilometers (16 miles) northeast
of Zagreb.
	   Many more will watch live TV coverage of the event, considered
one of the biggest in the recent history of the country where about
80 percent of its 4.7 million people are Roman Catholics.
	   Stepinac was hailed as a hero by Catholics for his resistance to
communism and refusal to separate the Croatian church from the
Vatican. But his beatification, the last step before possible
sainthood, is controversial because many Serbs and Jews accuse him
of sympathizing with the Nazis.
	   On Friday, the pontiff knelt and prayed for two minutes before
the glass tomb of Stepinac, embalmed in red and gold vestments and
a gold miter, in Zagreb's cathedral.
	   While serving as Zagreb's archbishop in 1941, Stepinac supported
Croatia's German-backed fascist puppet government led by dictator
Ante Pavelic.
	   By 1942, however, Stepinac denounced the regime's genocidal
policies, which led to the extermination of thousands of Serbs,
Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents. Stepinac's own notes and recent
studies say he spoke out against the atrocities, and worked to save
lives, but many Serbs still consider him a war criminal.
	   After the war, the cardinal was tried by Yugoslavia's communist
government and sentenced to prison for collaborating with the
Nazis. He died while under house arrest, the basis of the Vatican's
finding that he died for his faith.
	   On Friday, the pope spoke of ``the terrible period of Communist
repression.''
	   Croatia was a part of communist-run Yugoslavia until 1991, when
it proclaimed independence. The Vatican was one of the first
countries to recognize the young state.
	   The secession of Croatia, and later of neighboring Bosnia, led
to bloody wars in which tens of thousands of people were killed.
	   When the pontiff came here for the first time in 1994, one third
of the country was still in rebel Serbs hands, while the war in
Bosnia was still raging.
	   ``Now, happily, the war is no more,'' the pope told a crowd in
the cathedral square. ``My hope is that there will never again be
war in this noble country,'' he said to sustained applause.
	   ``The obstacles created by the consequences of war and the
mentality shaped by the Communist regime are many,'' the pope said.
``I hope most fervently that in this part of Europe there will
never again be a repetition of the inhuman situations which we have
repeatedly seen in this century.''
	   The pontiff also called on Croats to spur reconciliation among
the nation's ethnic, religious and political groups. In a gentle
jab at the government, he urged ``an ever greater democratization
of society.''
	   The 78-year-old pope, slowed by a series of ailments in recent
years, appeared in good form and delighted by the warm welcome.

Brazilians tending to give Cardoso a second chance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With recession and record
unemployment looming, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso wants
another chance to fix Brazil's battered economy.
	   And some 106 million voters seem overwhelmingly inclined to give
him another four-year term as they head to the polls Sunday in
national elections. They also will pick 27 governors, all 513
federal deputies, one-third of the 81-seat Senate and 1,045 state
legislators.
	   For weeks, all major polls show Cardoso, a 67-year-old
sociologist, has enough votes to win re-election on the first
ballot. Voters are clinging to the hope that Cardoso can revive the
magic of the Plano Real, an anti-inflation program so successful it
propelled him to the presidency on the first ballot in 1994.
	   The plan created a dollar-pegged currency, the real, and slashed
2,400 percent annual inflation to near zero in the world's
ninth-largest economy. Brazilians consumed more, imported more, and
thought the bounty would last indefinitely.
	   But it ended quickly with last year's Asian crisis, and keeps
getting worse. The main problem is a huge budget deficit _ nearly
dlrs 60 billion _ and the fear that Brazil won't get the financing
to cover it.
	   Even as Cardoso campaigned, his economic team was in Washington
D.C. negotiating a huge loan package with the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other public and private lenders.
The value of the package was put at dlrs 30 billion or more.
	   But there's a price, and Cardoso hasn't tried to hide it. A week
before elections, he promised spending cuts, austerity, and maybe
new taxes in the months ahead.
	   All but forgotten are his early campaign promises to create 7.8
million jobs to combat unemployment that unions estimate at 18
percent. There's little chance for growth in the lean times ahead.
	   And there still is the question of long-delayed social reforms:
fixing the crumbling schools and hospitals, settling landless
farmers, redressing the distribution of wealth that is among the
most unequal in the world.
	   Brazilians hold to their only hope with stubborn optimism.
	   ``Controlling inflation had to be his first option and he
succeeded,'' said Vicky Piha, a Sao Paulo housewife. ``With another
four years, I'm sure he'll at least start solving the country's
serious social problems.''
	   Voting is mandatory for Brazilians between 18 and 70, and
failure to vote without a good excuse can bring a fine and
bureaucratic hassles.

Australians go to the polls to choose government for the new

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian voters went to the polls
Saturday to choose between a conservative incumbent promising an
unpopular new tax and a Labor party that they had cast into the
political wilderness just 2 1/2 years earlier.
	   About 12 million registered voters began casting their ballots
at about 2230 GMT. Thousands of polling booths were set up in
public buildings in towns from the nation's desert Outback to its
tropical north and in its modern, bustling cities in the southeast.
	   Counting will begin about 0800 GMT, but the closeness of the
race means the final results may not be known for days.
	   Prime Minister John Howard has staked his government's fate on
what he calls ``economically radical'' tax reforms _ simplifying an
antiquated tax structure that has built up since the 1930s.
	   Whether Howard retains power rests on voters' willingness to
accept a 10 percent tax on all goods and services.
	   Howard's main opponent, Labor Party leader Kim Beazley, is
promising something far less painful: to create 500,000 new jobs.
And he has used a ``no tax'' promise to pull Labor close enough to
smell victory.
	   Labor was thrown out in a landslide victory for Howard in 1996,
and the historical odds are against Beazley.
	   Labor must hold all its current electorates and win 27 more to
seize a majority in the House of Representatives, the more powerful
chamber in Australia's bicameral Parliament.
	   If it succeeds, Labor will have achieved the largest comeback in
Australian election history, and Howard's will become the first
single-term government since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
	   Labor and the coalition have been in a dead heat for weeks,
according to the polls, indicating the most likely outcome may be
another Howard government but with a reduced majority.
	   But a Newspoll published Saturday in The Weekend Australian
shows a late surge by Labor large enough to restore it to power if
repeated at the ballot box. The telephone survey of 2,618 voters a
few days before the election put support for Labor at 44 percent
against the coalition's 40 percent.
	   Currently, Howard's governing conservatives hold 91 seats, Labor
49 and independents eight.
	   Even if Howard retains control in the House of Representatives,
where government is formed, polls have indicated minor parties or
independents again will hold the balance of power in the upper
house, meaning the government may have to negotiate to get bills
passed.
	   Howard has tried to soften his tax plan by linking it to income
tax cuts worth Australian dollars 13 billion (U.S. dlrs 7.6
billion) a year and has promised to abolish a variety of other
wholesale taxes. But the income tax cuts are based on the uncertain
assumption that the Australian economy will continue to grow 3.5
percent a year to keep the federal budget in surplus.
	   The International Monetary Fund this week predicted Australia's
economic growth was likely to be 2.25 percent this year and 2.5
percent the following fiscal year. Australia's major trading
partners, South Korea and Japan, are in recession.
	   Beazley, meanwhile, has promised to create a half-million jobs
in three years and has called for income tax cuts targeting
low-income earners. His proposed cuts would cost Australian dollars
3 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.8 billion), an amount he says would be
affordable even under the IMF's modest growth projections.

Balkan heads of state meet as NATO ponders strikes in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS with comments from Greek foreign minister &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DELPHI, Greece (AP) _ As NATO ponders military action in Kosovo,
the leaders of Bulgaria, Greece and Romania gather in this home of
the ancient oracle to try to divine the future of their troubled
region.
	   ``This trilateral meeting is very important ... two of them are
the only European Union candidates in the region,'' said European
Affairs Minister George Papandreou.
	   EU-member Greece has been pushing the candidacies of Bulgaria
and Romania, countries which worry that a spread of the conflict in
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo could ruin their emerging economies
and possibly engulf them in a region-wide war.
	   ``It is clear that these two countries present... political
stability. Therefore they have particular duties which they must
undertake,'' said Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos.
	   Starting Saturday, Presidents Petar Stoyanov of Bulgaria and
Emil Constantinescu of Romania will hold a two-day meeting with
Greek Premier Costas Simitis in this ancient site, located on a
rocky and forested mountain 180 kilometers (112 miles) north of
Athens.
	   In ancient times, Delphi was considered to be the center of the
earth. In times of crisis, Greeks would visit the shrine, where a
priestess in a trance would relate the words of the gods and
foretell the future.
	   The trilateral meeting is taking place just days before United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan is to submit a report on
Yugoslav compliance with a Security Council resolution, essentially
demanding an end to the Kosovo offensive by Serbian police and the
Yugoslav army.
	   The resolution threatens unspecified further action, seen by
many as the decision NATO needs for military intervention.
	   All three countries at the summit oppose such action, fearing a
repeat of the Bosnian war and the sanctions that harmed the
economies of their countries.
	   ``We insist that a final effort must be made to lead both sides
to the negotiating table'' before military intervention, Pangalos
said.
	   The trilateral meeting also takes place just before the annual
summit meeting of Balkan heads of state to be held in Antalya,
Turkey, on Oct. 12-13.
	   During the previous summit on the Greek island of Crete last
year, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic met with Albania's
prime minister and discussed Kosovo. It was the first such meeting
in 49 years.
	   Sources close to the three delegations also said other joint
projects will be discussed, including an agreement signed last
month by Bulgaria, Greece and Romania to fight crime.
	   Under that accord, police forces from the three countries will
fight crime.
	   The crisis in Kosovo has emphasized the need to build up a
transport and communications infrastructure connecting their
countries to central and eastern Europe.
	   A sticking point that may be resolved is a trans-European
highway originating in St. Petersburg, Russia, crossing through
Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria and ending in the northern Greek port
of Alexandroupolis.

Angola reaffirms decision to sever contact with UNITA leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Angola reaffirmed its decision to sever
contact with the head of the former rebel movement UNITA and urged
international recognition for officials who split with him as the
valid UNITA representatives.
	   Angola's vice-minister for foreign relations, Joao Bernardo
Miranda, told the General Assembly on Friday that it was dangerous
to continue negotiating the completion of the 1994 peace accord
with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
	   ``This would only lead to more false expectations and we would
be wasting much needed time to take appropriate measures in this
respect,'' he said.
	   Instead, he said, the world should recognize a group called the
``Renovation Committee'' of UNITA members who split with Savimbi,
claiming he didn't want peace.
	   ``This renovation movement supports the peace accords, national
reconciliation, effective transformation of UNITA into a civilian
political party and it has given a new breath of hope for the
conclusion of the peace process,'' Miranda said.
	   The Security Council has rejected the government's recognition
of the group as the legitimate partners in negotiating the 1994
U.N.-brokered peace accord that ended nearly two decades of civil
war.
	   In a resolution last month, the council urged the government
reconsider its decision. Savimbi still controls land in Angola.
	   Angola's peace process has crumbled with a recent resurgence in
fighting between the government and Savimbi's troops. Tensions
mounted after the government severed contact with Savimbi last
month.
	   UNITA fought a civil war against the government for nearly two
decades after Angola won independence from Portugal in 1975. The
1994 accord ended the fighting, but the United Nations says UNITA
has resisted implementing it, particularly by refusing to hand over
four key territories and demobilize its troops.

Latvians vote on laws that angered Russia, distressed the West

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ In a referendum on whether to make
citizenship easier for the country's enormous ethnic Russian
community, Latvians on Saturday will choose between soothing a
sense of injured pride and risking future injury.
	   The referendum, held in conjunction with voting for the
country's 100-seat Saeima parliament, asks voters in the former
Soviet republic if they want to reject liberalizing citizenship law
amendments that parliament passed in June.
	   The amendments were passed after a tense spring in which Russia
threatened trade sanctions against its diminutive neighbor.
	   Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians poured into Latvia
after it was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union as part of Josef
Stalin's drive to ``Russify'' Soviet lands.
	   The influx was so enormous that today, only about 52 percent of
the people in this country of 2.5 million are ethnic Latvians. The
waves of Russians were deeply resented by Latvians, and critics say
the country's citizenship laws have no rationale but sheer spite.
	   After it won independence in 1991, Latvia granted automatic
citizenship only to those who lived in the country before World War
II and their descendants. That left 700,000 ethnic Russians
stateless.
	   The Russians, who make up about one-third of Latvia's
population, often accuse Latvians of discriminating against them.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is also
putting pressure on Latvia, urging it to lower its obstacles to
citizenship if it wants to join the European Union.
	   But many Latvians want to keep the strict citizenship laws, and
after the amendments were passed, a referendum drive to overturn
them began, spearheaded by nationalist politicians who claim
Latvian national identity is imperiled.
	   Many Latvians resent Russians, seeing them not only as reminders
of Latvia's suffering during 50 years of Soviet rule, but as
diluting Latvia's sense of itself.
	   While almost all Latvians speak passable Russian because they
learned it in Soviet-era schools, many Russians in the country
speak little or no Latvian.
	   Whether voters will choose to abandon their resentment by
accepting the changes or antagonizing Russia and dismaying the West
by rejecting them is unclear. No opinion polls on the referendum
have been conducted.
	   Of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the Saeima
(pronounced SIGH-mah), the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party
of Prime Minister Guntars Krasts is the only major party
campaigning to turn down the changes.
	   On issues other than citizenship, like the need to seek EU and
NATO membership, there is wide agreement among the parties. There
is also broad support for free-market reforms.
	   Voter support for one party or another seems based as much on
the personality of leaders as on specific issues.
	   The party that has been No. 1 in most pre-election polls with
around 20 percent support is the center-right Peoples Party, a new
party founded by wealthy businessman and a former prime minister,
Andris Skele.
	   Skele has said Latvia relies too much on transit trade with
Russia, and said policies should also focus on producing goods in
Latvia for export.

Australia's election at a glance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Some 12 million eligible voters among Australia's population of
18 million go to the polls Saturday in a national parliamentary
election.
	   Polls are open from 8 a.m.-6 p.m. (In the eastern states, 2200
GMT Friday-0800 GMT Saturday; in the west, 0000-1000 GMT Saturday).
	   The major parties and their leaders and policies are:
	   _Prime Minister John Howard's governing conservative coalition,
composed of his urban-based Liberal Party and the rural National
Party.
	   Howard is running on his management of the economy, growing at
about 3 percent while most of Asia is in recession, and on the need
for tax reform. He wants to introduce a 10 percent goods and
services tax. To sweeten the new tax, Howard linked it to promised
income tax cuts worth 13 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 7.6
billion) a year.
	   _Kim Beazley's Labor Party, which was ousted by Howard's
conservatives in 1996 after 13 years in power. Beazley is promising
no goods and services tax if his party is elected, and is also
offering more modest income tax cuts targeted at Labor's working
class constituents.
	   Labor has also promised to create 500,000 jobs in its first
three-year term.
	   The conservatives and Labor have been attracting about 43
percent each in
	   neck-and-neck polls throughout the campaign.
	   _Pauline Hanson's new right-wing populist One Nation party,
founded just last year. Hanson warns Australia is being ``swamped''
by Asians and would cut off Asian immigration. She also contends
Aborigines are the most privileged minority in Australia and would
abolish welfare programs for them.
	   One Nation stands no chance of winning government, since it is
polling about 7 percent, but it could tilt the balance of power in
a number of close races for Parliamentary seats.
	   In the 148-seat House of Representatives, where government is
formed, Howard's Liberal Party and the Nationals hold 90 seats, the
Labor Party holds
	   49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's Country Liberal
Party, 1.
	   Labor would need to win 27 seats to gain government, a feat no
Australian
	   opposition party has ever achieved.
	   Of the 76 Senate seats, 40 will be contested in this election.
Howard's government has 37 seats in the Senate, Labor 28, the
Australian Democrats 7, the Greens 2 and there are 2 independents.

Tyson psychiatric reports delayed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Nevada boxing authorities will have to wait a
little longer to see what a team of psychiatrists has to say about
the state of Mike Tyson's mind.
	   And Tyson may have to wait even longer to try and get his boxing
license if his attorneys go ahead with plans to appeal to the
Nevada Supreme Court in an effort to keep the public from seeing
Tyson's psychiatric reports.
	   Attorneys for Tyson did not comment, but a source close to the
Nevada Athletic Commission said Tyson's attorneys may be in court
again Monday to seek a stay of a judge's ruling that opened the
door for the records to be made public.
	   Reports from a five-day evaluation of the former heavyweight
champion still hadn't been sent to the commission offices as of
closing time Friday, four days after they were due.
	   Tyson attorney Jim Jimmerson said earlier he expected to have
the documents sent to the commission by Monday at the latest.
	   But Tyson's lawyers indicated late Friday to the commission that
they might continue the fight to keep the records from the public.
If so, a tentative Oct. 19 hearing date on Tyson's license would
presumably be moved back, jeopardizing any chances of Tyson
fighting this year.
	   Tyson's advisers have argued that the reports should be given
only to the commission and not be made public because that would
violate Tyson's right to confidentiality.
	   ``There's going to be some embarrassing things in the report,
I'm sure,'' Jimmerson said.
	   Jimmerson said he expected the report to be some 30 to 50 pages
and summarize a battery of tests and interviews that Tyson
submitted to last week at Massachusetts General Hospital.
	   Boxing commissioners demanded the reports at a Sept. 19 hearing
and had set a hearing for Saturday to decide whether to license
Tyson. But when the reports were delayed so was the hearing and it
is not expected to be held until at least Oct. 19.
	   ``I can't schedule a hearing until we have the documents,'' said
Marc Ratner, executive director of the commission.
	   Jimmerson went to court Thursday to try to block the documents
from becoming public information. But a judge, though saying he was
sympathetic to Tyson, said he could find no state statute that
would prevent their release as public records.
	   Jimmerson said after the ruling that he doubted it would be
appealed.
	   The suit was the latest twist in Tyson's increasingly complex
battle to regain the boxing license stripped from him for biting
Evander Holyfield's ears.
	   In addition to the tests, Tyson is expected to be grilled over
an Aug. 31 traffic accident in Maryland in which two men claim he
assaulted him.
	   While Tyson's attorneys have been negotiating with attorneys for
the two men in hopes of reaching a settlement before the commission
hearing, he is still scheduled to stand trial Oct. 19 for the
incident.
	   No negotiations are underway to drop the second-degree assault
charges, and prosecutors say they plan to go ahead with the case.

Eritrea urges independent investigation into border dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Eritrea urged an independent investigation
into the human rights conditions in the Horn of African nation,
which is locked in a border dispute with Ethiopia.
	   Eritrea's foreign minister, Haile Weldensae, told the General
Assembly Friday that the responsibility for the conflict, which was
sparked in May, rested solely with its former friend, Ethiopia.
	   ``At no time have Eritrean troops crossed Eritrea's
internationally recognized borders and it is there for everybody to
see,'' he said. ``On the contrary, it was Ethiopian troops that
invaded Eritrea.''
	   The two countries have regularly traded accusations about the
dispute _ and the volley was exchanged at the United Nations this
week.
	   On Thursday, Ethiopia's foreign minister, Seyoum Mesfin, said
his country was trying its best to avoid a war in its territorial
dispute with Eritrea, but would stand up to the aggression
regardless of the consequences.
	   Although no significant fighting has been reported since June,
both countries have been beefing up their entrenched positions
along their common 1,000-kilometer (625-mile) border.
	   Eritrea claims it is on territory that is rightful its own
according to internationally recognized boundaries Italian colonial
boundaries.
	   Ethiopia claims that Eritrean troops are occupying its territory
and will not enter peace talks until they withdraw.
	   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after having
been annexed by Addis Ababa in the early 1960s after passing from
Italian to British to United Nations control.

Mexicans mark 30th anniversary of Tlatelolco massacre
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS to UPDATE with Zapatista statement, color, crowd size &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK CONTRERAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Thousands of Mexicans _ from teenagers to
elderly mothers _ rallied at the site where students and protesters
were killed 30 years ago when police and army troops opened fire on
a peaceful democracy demonstration.
	   For the first time since the Oct. 2, 1968, massacre, city
workers lowered flags to half staff _ an order from opposition
leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas who won Mexico City's first mayoral
election last year.
	   Around 30,000 people _ by police estimate _ marched Friday from
the city's main square, the Zocalo, to the Tlatelolco plaza where
the massacre took place. Many carried signs asking that the
military release records on the bloody confrontation.
	   ``This day also marks the ... 30th anniversary of a movement
that fought for democracy, freedom and justice for all Mexicans,''
read a statement from Subcomandante Marcos, leader of the Zapatista
rebels in southern Chiapas state. ``We must not forget ... the
struggle continues.''
	   The crowds at Tlatelolco cheered the rebel leader's message and
shouted angry insults when student leaders mentioned President
Ernesto Zedillo's name.
	   Police deployed 2,500 officers to control several marches
commemorating the date. But aside from a few isolated fights and a
couple of smashed bus windows, the rally was largely peaceful,
police said.
	   Candles and flowers sat at the foot of a monument honoring those
who were gunned down _ the exact number of victims has never been
revealed _ during a peaceful demonstration 10 days before the 1968
Olympic Games.
	   Clara Nadales, 72, wept softly in front of the monument. She
said two of her children _ ages 18 and 23 _ were killed when army
troops and special police squads opened fire on the crowd of
thousands.
	   The army cordoned off the square, chased students through a
nearby apartment complex and collected the bodies. Later, it said
between 30 and 40 people were killed, though international media
placed the death toll at about 300.
	   The Mexican government released some official files on the
massacre this year, but said the army will be allowed to keep its
records secret. The decision has angered rights and student groups,
and frustrated an investigation launched by the nation's first
opposition-dominated Congress here in nearly seven decades.
	   Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, president at the time of the massacre, died
in 1979; then-Interior Secretary Luis Echeverria said in a
television interview aired Friday that he was not responsible for
ordering the army to open fire.
	   ``I think there should have been more openness on the part of
the authorities'' in dealing with the students' demands for
democracy, ``but not the use of violence,'' Echeverria told Channel
40.
	   ``If it is said that I controlled the army, and ordered them to
fire, and I'm responsible for what happened, it wasn't that way,''
Echeverria said.
	   Echeverria succeeded Diaz Ordaz as president. But his role _ and
those of others _ may not be become clear ``for two or three
generations ... when everybody is put in his place (in history),''
Echeverria said.

Investigators uncover 289 secret bank accounts by ex-president's
</HEADLINE>
brother &QL; 
 &UR; By JULIE WATSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Federal investigators have uncovered 289
secret bank accounts and scores of properties belonging to the
brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a law
enforcement official said Friday.
	   Deputy attorney general Jose Luis Ramos Rivera told a news
conference the accounts and properties were found in a series of
raids since July in raids at offices and homes of aides to Raul
Salinas, the ex-president's brother.
	   Raul Salinas has been in jail since February 1995 on trial for
illicit enrichment, alleged money laundering and masterminding the
murder of his brother-in-law Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, a leading
ruling party politician.
	   Government prosecutors have suffered setbacks in their cases
against Raul Salinas for murder and money laundering. But Ramos
Rivera said the new evidence made public Friday will strengthen the
illicit enrichment case.
	   Prosecutors have been insisting Raul Salinas could not have
amassed the fortune he did while employed as a mid-level government
employee at around dlrs 30,000 a year during his brother's 1988-94
administration.
	   Salinas, through his lawyers, has insisted he is innocent of the
charges and made the money through legal business deals.
	   Ramos Rivera said investigators have discovered, aside from the
bank accounts here and abroad, 123 homes, ranches, apartments and
land holdings.
	   He said the accounts were found under Raul Salinas's name or
those of an alias or business partners. Some 85 accounts were in
foreign banks, totaling about dlrs 55.7 million. In Mexico, bank
holdings discovered so far amount to some dlrs 94.6 million.
	   Officials also found financial documents and computer discs in
the raids in Mexico City and Ciudad Juarez, across the border from
El Paso, Texas, of homes and businesses of Raul Salinas's
accountant, Juan Manuel Gomez Gutierrez.

Japanese financial giants announce broad alliance

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. and Dai-Ichi
Mutual Life Insurance Co. have announced the latest in a series
alliances between Japanese financial giants as the country begins
sweeping market deregulation.
	   The companies said Friday they have agreed to a broad tie-up
that analysts said could eventually lead to them forming a joint
holding company.
	   In the near term, the alliance will include cooperation in new
product development, sales and asset management, the presidents of
the two companies said at a joint news conference.
	   Dai-Ichi President Tomijiro Morita said his company will also
buy up to 10 percent of IBJ's shares _ a move analysts valued at
about 100 billion yen (dlrs 740 million).
	   The link comes amid a wave of business tie-ups and mergers as
Japanese finance companies prepare for the ``Big Bang,'' a package
of market-opening moves that will liberalize prices, allow new
products and ease market entry by new companies.
	   Some companies have sought foreign expertise. On Friday, Sakura
Bank Ltd. said it is holding talks with Germany's Deutsche Bank AG
about a possible joint venture to manage mutual funds.
	   Another trend has been consolidation within existing industrial
groups, such as when four financial institutions belonging to the
Mitsubishi group said last month they will jointly set up a
securities company.
	   IBJ, which was set up in 1902 to supply cheap funds to
industrial development, lacks a group of its own. But analysts said
Dai-Ichi Life, Japan's second-largest life insurer, was an
attractive partner because its vast sales network geared toward
individual customers would compliment IBJ's long list of blue chip
corporate clients.
	   ``The alliance fits with IBJ's strategy to reposition itself as
an integrated financial institution, providing a variety of
services amid the ongoing deregulation,'' U.S. ratings service
Standard and Poor's said after the announcement.
	   IBJ President Masao Nishimura said that the tie-up was separate
from a partnership the bank formed earlier this year with Nomura
Securities Co., which deals mainly with investment management and
derivatives trading.
	   Nishimura said the two companies will set up a panel to hammer
out details of their alliance as soon as possible.

As hall's doors open, Bird takes a pass on fame
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS grafs 2-5 to UPDATE with Bird comments at induction &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFF DONN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) _ With three NBA championships, almost
universal respect as one of the game's greatest players, and now a
place in basketball's pantheon, Larry Bird still won't take a full
bow.
	   About 7,000 players, coaches, basketball officials, many home
state fans and others set off throaty chants of ``Lah-ree, Lah-ree,
Lah-ree'' for two minutes to celebrate Bird's induction into the
Basketball Hall of Fame Friday night at this city's Civic Center.
	   Sometimes put down as a hayseed during his spectacular career,
Bird was full of down-home, self-mocking humor at his induction. He
recalled asking for a first-class airplane seat with the Celtics in
his second year there.
	   ``I said, `Excuse me ... . Go tell coach (Bill) Fitch that I'm a
first-class player; I expect a first-class seat.'' The answer came
back: ``Tell him to get his butt on the plane.''
	   Earlier in the day, Bird said, ``It's not about me playing. It's
about me and my team.''
	   The Boston Celtics great enters the shrine with two other
players _ Marques Haynes of the Harlem Globetrotters and Arnie
Risen, also of the Celtics.
	   Other inductees are coaches Alex Hannum of the 1967 NBA champion
Philadelphia 76ers, Jody Conradt of the University of Texas and
Aleksandar Nikolic of Yugoslavia.
	   Atlanta Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens, inducted as a player in 1989,
was honored again, this time as the NBA's winningest coach. He has
an NBA coaching record of 1,120-908, including a 1979 championship
with Seattle.
	   But it was Bird alone who was besieged at a morning news
conference. Clearly uncomfortable with the hoopla, Bird at times
stared at the ceiling.
	   ``Certainly it is an honor to be here _ for me to attend Larry's
party,'' Wilkens said.
	   Along with Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan, Bird and his clutch
shots and breathtaking passes fueled the explosive growth of
contemporary basketball.
	   Through it all, Bird, who grew up outside French Lick, Ind.,
stayed almost enigmatically private. Only on the court did he
compete with the game's most flamboyant and self-promoting stars.
	   ``Everywhere I go, people ask me about my playing days. It seems
like it's getting worse, not better,'' said Bird, now 41 and coach
of the Indiana Pacers. ``Once this is over, I think I can close the
book on my career and look forward.''
	   From his entry in the NBA in 1979 to his retirement in 1992,
Bird averaged 24.3 points, 10 rebounds and 6.3 assists a game. The
6-foot-9 forward led Boston to NBA championships against Houston in
1981 and 1986 and Los Angeles in 1984. He was a three-time NBA Most
Valuable Player and twice a finals MVP.

Japanese financial giants announce broad alliance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to replace missing word in lead
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. and Dai-Ichi
Mutual Life Insurance Co. have announced the latest in a series of
alliances between Japanese financial giants as the country begins
sweeping market deregulation.
	   The companies said Friday they have agreed to a broad tie-up
that analysts said could eventually lead to them forming a joint
holding company.
	   In the near term, the alliance will include cooperation in new
product development, sales and asset management, the presidents of
the two companies said at a joint news conference.
	   Dai-Ichi President Tomijiro Morita said his company will also
buy up to 10 percent of IBJ's shares _ a move analysts valued at
about 100 billion yen (dlrs 740 million).
	   The link comes amid a wave of business tie-ups and mergers as
Japanese finance companies prepare for the ``Big Bang,'' a package
of market-opening moves that will liberalize prices, allow new
products and ease market entry by new companies.
	   Some companies have sought foreign expertise. On Friday, Sakura

Mexican drug suspect shot in Baja California massacre dies of
</HEADLINE>
wounds &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ An alleged drug-trafficker who survived the
massacre of his extended family last month died Friday in the Baja
California state town of Ensenada, police said.
	   State police commander Cesar Beltran Lopez said Fermin Castro
Ramirez died in the afternoon at hospital as a result of
complications from two bullet wounds in the Sept. 17 massacre at
the small Indian community of El Sauzal near Ensenada.
	   Castro's body was turned over to the morgue for an autopsy,
Beltran was quoted by the government news agency Notimex as saying.
	   Eighteen members of his extended family were roused from their
beds at night by a group of gunmen who lined them up against a wall
and opened fire with heavy caliber automatic weapons.
	   The gunmen fled and have not been caught. Police said Castro _
who appeared to be the main target of the attack _ was hit on the
head and stayed in a coma until the end.
	   Police believe the gunmen were linked to drug traffickers.
	   Federal police have detained 10 people in connection with the
killings at El Sauzal ranch, but none of them have been arraigned
yet.
	   Investigators say the massacre may have been related to Castro's
alleged drug-trafficking activities. Relatives, however, say Castro
is a rancher with no involvement in drugs.

Strong earthquake hits southwestern China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A moderately strong earthquake struck a remote
mountainous region in southwestern China's Yunnan province, but
there were no immediate reports of casualties, a local official
said Saturday.
	   The magnitude 5.3 earthquake hit Friday evening in Ninglang Yi
Autonomous County, a region of rugged terrain along Yunnan's border
with Sichuan province, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   About 10 percent of the houses in the area were severely
damaged, but information on casualties was still incomplete, said
an official at the provincial Seismology Bureau who gave only his
surname, Li.
	   He said the area had been rattled by eight aftershocks since the
earthquake.
	   Xinhua said the bureau had sent teams to the affected area to
investigate and monitor any further quakes.
	   Ninglang is an area predominantly inhabited by the Yi, one of
China's many ethnic minorities.
	   The area is one of China's most seismically active regions. A
magnitude 7 earthquake on Feb. 3, 1996, in neighboring Lijiang
killed 255 people and injured 14,000.
