<HEADLINE> Dow Up 105.43 in Morning Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today, with technology shares  
showing surprising strength a day before the Federal Reserve was to 
announce whether it will raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In late-morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 105.43 at 11,206.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 13.44 at 1,350.05, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 39.08 at 2,687.41. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's Open Market Committee meets Tuesday, and most  
economists predict the central bank will raise short-term interest 
rates a quarter-percentage point. Since higher interest rates can 
cut into corporate profits, stocks have faltered since the Fed 
first raised the possibility of a rate increase in July. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent sessions, however, stocks have edged back toward  
record highs as the market absorbed the likelihood of higher rates. 
This morning, the Dow briefly traded above its July 16 record close 
of 11,209.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks are also benefiting from a growing belief that the Fed  
may limit its action to one modest increase on Tuesday. In its bid 
to keep inflation from accelerating, the Fed also raised rates on 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, we expect a very solid summer rally based on very  
positive earnings reports and growing investor confidence that 
future Fed hikes will likely be moderate,'' said John H. 
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were buoying the Nasdaq. Amazon.com was up 5  
11/16 to 119 1/8, and Yahoo rose 5 3/4 to 150 3/4. Many of those stocks have 
been driven down by concerns over interest rates as their high 
prices and often meager earnings drove investors in search of more 
guaranteed investments. 
</P>
<P>
	United Water Resources rose 2 to 33 1/16 after French utility  
Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, launched a $35-per-share bid to acquire 
full ownership of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 198.62 million 
shares, behind Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, measuring the performance of smaller  
companies, rose 2.21 to 436.59.

<HEADLINE> Bush Uses Tax Law To Cut Own Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Texas (AP) -- When Gov. George W. Bush goes fishing at  
his lakeside retreat, he can be sure the biggest bite won't come 
from the taxman. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with cutting property taxes for Texans, Bush has managed  
to reduce his own bill by half on the rustic hideaway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate is among homeowners who  
have qualified for reduced taxes on private lake property in the 
piney woods of East Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The retreat had been the only home he owned since 1995, until he  
purchased a ranch in central Texas earlier this month. The 
lakehouse is a weekend getaway for Bush, who lives in the 
Governor's Mansion in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say he is taking advantage of a loophole and should pay  
at the full rate even if he does not have to. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without sacrificing too much of his wealth, he should have  
paid the tax and made it an example during his talks on property 
tax reform,'' said Democratic consultant Ed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and at least 15 other homeowners have halved their tax  
liability at their Rainbo Club acreage through a 1977 measure 
allowing club properties to be designated as recreational, park and 
scenic land. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rainbo Club turned to the provision in 1992 after Henderson  
County officials stripped the property of an agricultural exemption 
that had originally lowered the tax. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify for the tax cut, property must be at least five acres  
and covered by a deed restricting usage for at least 10 years. The 
current tax break hinges on a deed restriction that lasts through 
2011. 
</P>
<P>
	Members at the Rainbo Club own their own homes on 1,207 acres of  
leased land. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who bought into the club in December 1991, owns a house  
and guest cottage valued at $101,770. In October 1998, he paid 
$543.07 in property taxes, county records show. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan defends the use of the  
tax break, saying it is one that many Texans can enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vast majority of property in Texas qualifies for some  
exemption and this is one of those,'' said McClellan. Bush has 
shepherded some $2.8 billion in property tax cuts through the 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	But Martin says the intent of the tax break was not for rural  
counties, but to ensure space for parks and greenways in cities 
``so every inch wouldn't be paved over with a house and a swimming 
pool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One person, three clubs and 21 golf courses are currently using  
the exemption in nearby Dallas, says Cheryl Jordan of the Dallas 
County Appraisal District. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who last visited his retreat in June, has said he's doing  
nothing wrong in reducing his tax bill through the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is should you value property based upon its  
usage?'' the governor said. ``My answer is yes you should, whether 
it be for agricultural purposes or hunting and fishing or a 
homestead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rainbo Club is seven miles from the center of Athens, a town  
of 11,500 in an area that serves as a country getaway for Dallas 
millionaires. Travel for a few hundred yards off a state highway 
and there beneath a canopy of hardwoods is the entrance to Bush's 
club: a slightly askew wooden sign announcing Rainbo. 
</P>
<P>
	A few yards farther down the winding road the look is more  
sophisticated. A visitor encounters an electronic security gate, an 
8-foot-tall game fence with a pine tree screen surrounding the 
property, and a big No Trespassing sign. 
</P>
<P>
	There's not much worry about uninvited folks visiting from  
Athens, ``Black-eyed Pea Capital of the World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors less than a mile away don't know the private lake  
exists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never heard of the place,'' said Jerri Mayo, working in a  
town pawn shop.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Bills Interest Rates Rise / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.5 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.850 percent, up from 4.680 percent last 
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.950 percent, up from 4.900 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since Aug. 24, 1998, when  
the bills sold for 4.920 percent. The six-month rate was the 
highest since June 28 when the rate was 4.960. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.991 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,876.10 and 5.161 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,749.80. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 5.20 
percent last week from 5.23 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Runner Bounces Back From Sickness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Flat on his back 18 months ago with  
malaria and pneumonia, Wilson Kipketer thought he might never run 
again. At least, not in this world. 
</P>
<P>
	``After being sick, I was almost going to another world, and I  
didn't know if I was going to run in that world,'' said the 
Kenyan-born Dane, the two-time defending world champion at 800 
meters and world record-holder at the distance (1 minute, 41.11 
seconds). 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm still running here,'' he added. ``This is the most  
important thing. After that (malaria), I thought maybe my career 
was finished in running and I'd have to do something else. ... 
Everything was gone. I had to start from zero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unbeatable in 1996 and '97 -- but dead last a year ago in the  
European Championships, still suffering the side effects of the 
disease he caught visiting Kenya -- Kipketer is back. 
</P>
<P>
	With the top time in the world this season (1:42.57), he's a  
prohibitive favorite to win Friday's 800 final at the World 
Championships, setting the stage for his first Olympic gold next 
year in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	If there's one word to describe the new Kipketer, it's  
``happier.'' He's healthy again and has begun to manage his own 
business affairs, cutting out the middleman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really sick and I thought I was not going to run again,  
but I'm running and that's the most important thing. And that's why 
I'm happy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Famous for curt answers, he almost seemed to enjoy himself in an  
interview Monday. He got Danish citizenship last year -- after 
missing the 1996 Olympics because he didn't have it -- has a Danish 
girlfriend, speaks passable Danish, but lives mostly in the tax 
haven of Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was put on the spot by a Danish journalist and asked to  
name the most famous athletes in Denmark, he cracked a wry smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many best athletes,'' he said. ``I cannot name them  
because there are lots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even when a follow-up question might have drawn a frown, he  
smiled and tipped his sunglasses farther back on the top of his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	Does he plan to stay in Denmark for life?  
</P>
<P>
	``I have to take one thing at a time,'' he said. ``It's still a  
long time to decide where I'm going to live when I finish running. 
... Things change any time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should more of Kenya's super-talented distance runners seek  
citizenship abroad, forsaking the homeland? 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot say it's the right choice or not the right choice,''  
said the 26-year-old Kipketer, who first went to Denmark in 1990 as 
a student. ``Athletes have to decide where they can feel 
comfortable or where they can train better. Everywhere you can run 
good. It depends where people feel comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer described his physical shape ``as just as good as it  
was before,'' but said this alone would not guarantee a title or 
another world record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not only being in shape,'' he said. ``You can be in good  
shape. But if you're not strong enough mentally ... you will not 
have concentration and focus on the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer should be ready on both counts. And it's almost certain  
he will have to run faster than he did to win his last two golds. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the time the athletes are getting better,'' he said. ``In  
'95, I won in 1:45, '97 was 1:43. I don't know what it will be now, 
but it will be very fast.''

<HEADLINE>  Albanians Bar Russians From Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians prevented Russian  
peacekeepers from entering the southern Kosovo town of Orahovac 
today, barricading the roads with tractors, cars and buses and 
deflecting efforts by Dutch and German forces to let the Russians 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo Albanians don't want Russian peacekeepers in Orahovac, 40  
miles southwest of Pristina, because they say Russians collaborated 
with Serb paramilitaries who swept through the region during the 
78-day NATO bombing campaign. Hundreds of thousands of Kosovo 
Albanians were forced from their homes and others were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russians cannot come to our city because they are criminals,''  
said Hasan Sokoli, 65, one of scores of townspeople manning the 
barricades. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians were supposed to have begun taking up positions in  
the town today, replacing Dutch soldiers who have been patrolling 
Orahovac, which is in the German sector of southwestern Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Russian armored personnel carriers rolled to the gates  
of the town, they found the roads blocked. A Russian officer tried 
to explain that his troops were taking control of the town under 
international agreements reached between NATO and the Russian 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanians, however, refused to accept the  
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	German and Dutch troops were also prevented from entering the  
town. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been anti-Russian protests at every place in Kosovo  
where Russians have been stationed in Albanian-majority areas. In 
contrast, the only time American troops have faced a hostile 
Albanian crowd was when they defended the Russians in one incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russians who took part in the most inhumane massacres and  
criminal acts are not welcome in Orahovac,'' Agim Hasku, a local 
leader, told a crowd of more than 1,500 gathered in the city's main 
square Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO yes, Russians no'' and ``Russians murdered our  
children,'' read some protesters' signs. Others waved the 
red-and-black Albanian flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Orahovac was the scene of heavy fighting in the summer of 1998,  
during Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown against 
ethnic Albanian separatists. 
</P>
<P>
	That crackdown led to NATO's bombing campaign of Yugoslavia,  
which ended when Milosevic accepted a peace plan in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shall find a way to fulfill our task,'' Col. Gen. Georgy  
Shpak told Russia's ITAR-Tass news agency today. ``We shall 
methodically and calmly occupy our positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While a small group of Russians were to arrive today, it was  
expected to take at least two weeks for them to take over full 
patrolling and security responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, the Dutch began rounding up hundreds of  
automatic and semi-automatic weapons from Orahovac's 2,000 
remaining Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups of Serbs gathered around the main collection point  
Sunday, smoking and discussing what would happen next. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all packing up to leave. We don't feel safe now without  
our weapons,'' said a man who gave his initials only as G.K. for 
fear of revenge attacks. He added that the planned arrival of the 
Russians would not help the situation because they would be under 
control of the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serbs are not satisfied with the relations'' the NATO-led  
peacekeepers have with them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bozana Dedic, a former schoolteacher in Orahovac, said her bags  
were packed and she was only waiting until an international 
organization could escort her and other Serbs who wanted to leave 
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I insisted on staying in Kosovo. But after all I survived,  
I'll never be back,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reprisal attacks by the majority ethnic Albanians have prompted  
most of Kosovo's former 200,000-member Serb community to seek 
sanctuary in other parts of Yugoslavia. Kosovo's population is 
largely ethnic Albanian.

<HEADLINE> Author Seeks Inspiration for Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAMESTOWN, Va. (AP) -- Crime author Patricia Cornwell says she  
has been looking to the first permanent English settlement in North 
America for inspiration for an upcoming novel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornwell has been studying the Jamestown colony, founded in  
1607, and learning about archaeology for the book, which she said 
will combine fiction and nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
	She is especially interested in the shooting almost 400 years  
ago of an early Virginia colonist that nearly cut off his leg. 
Pieces of a musket ball were found in the bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kay Scarpetta, the chief medical examiner character in  
Cornwell's novels, will investigate the death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to find a way to connect the crimes of the past with  
what's going on now,'' she said during a visit here Monday. ``I 
think we'll find human nature hasn't changed very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tentatively entitled ``The Last Precinct,'' the book is expected  
to be released next summer.

<HEADLINE> Washington Withdraws From U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- MaliVai Washington withdrew from the  
U.S. Open on Monday with a knee injury and will be replaced by 
Richey Reneberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mal informed me that he had re-injured his knee at the gym  
over the weekend and it would prevent him from competing at 100 
percent for the Open,'' tournament director Jay Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington originally injured his left knee in the 1997 Davis  
Cup against Brazil. He has been bothered by the injury ever since 
and has played sparingly since.

<HEADLINE> Prisoner Beaten, Killed in N.M. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ROSA, N.M. (AP) -- An inmate at a privately run prison was  
beaten to death with a laundry bag full of rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando Gabaldon, 51, was watching television Sunday when he was  
attacked, state police said. He had been serving a life sentence at 
Guadalupe County Correctional Facility for habitual armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were questioning another inmate.  
</P>
<P>
	The 600-bed prison, which began accepting inmates early this  
year, is run by Wackenhut Corrections Corp. The company has a $25 
million-a-year contract to hold about 1,500 inmates at two prisons 
in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Wackenhut headquarters in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.,  
was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 percent of New Mexico's 4,720 male inmates are in  
privately run prisons, some of which have been hit by outbreaks of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, five prisoners and two guards were injured in a  
fight Aug. 17 during an inmate softball game at the Torrance County 
Detention Facility in Estancia. Corrections Corporation of America 
runs the prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lea County Correctional Facility, operated by Wackenhut, has  
had three inmate stabbing deaths since it opened in May 1998.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Soars 199 to Record Close / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average soared to a  
record today as investors banished fears that the Federal Reserve 
will raise interest rates repeatedly in its bid to quell inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow was up 199.15 at  
11,299.76, easily surpassing its July 16 record close of 11,209.84. 
With today's gains, the Dow is up 23 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose sharply, although they remain  
below their record highs of mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	A wide range of stocks rose today, from fledgling Internet  
companies to multinational consumer companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a legitimate, strong demand to own stocks,'' said  
Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the market's rally surprised some analysts who had  
predicted a quiet, lackluster session ahead of the Fed's meeting 
Tuesday. In an effort to contain inflation, the central bank is 
widely expected to raise short-term interest rates a 
quarter-percentage point, following an increase on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Since higher interest rates can cut into corporate profits,  
stocks have faltered since the Fed first raised the possibility of 
a second rate increase. In recent sessions, however, stocks have 
edged back toward record highs as the market absorbed the 
likelihood of higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks are also benefiting from a growing belief that the Fed  
may hold steady after a modest increase on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, we expect a very solid summer rally based on very  
positive earnings reports and growing investor confidence that 
future Fed hikes will likely be moderate,'' said John H. 
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's gains today were broad-based, but driven primarily by  
financial and technology companies. Financial services companies 
like Morgan are especially sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. 
Higher rates make companies less likely to borrow money, cutting 
into lending volume and potentially slowing the pace of mergers and 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were buoying the Nasdaq. Amazon.com and Yahoo  
rose. Many of those stocks have been driven down recently by 
concerns over interest rates as their high prices and often weak 
earnings drove investors in search of more guaranteed investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Merger activity enlivened trading, even as volume remained low  
due to the Fed watch and summer vacations. United Water Resources 
rose after French utility Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux launched a 
$35-per-share bid to acquire full ownership of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
rose 23.61 to 1,360.22, and the Nasdaq composite index rose rose 
71.37 to 2,719.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,723 up, 1,269 down and 550 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 673.76 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
658.10 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.87 to 437.25.

<HEADLINE>  Russian Rebels Cling to Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Islamic rebels held ground in a  
village in the Caucasus Mountains, despite being hammered by 
Russian jets and artillery for days, Russian officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians have been targeting the mountaintop village of  
Tando, which lies along the supply route that has brought fighters 
and weapons from the breakaway territory of Chechnya. Russian 
officials even claimed on Sunday that they had taken part of Tando. 
</P>
<P>
	But they backed off that claim today, acknowledging that 100  
rebels were still in Tando, where they are encircled, according to 
the Interior Ministry. Up to 1,000 militants were still in the 
whole of Dagestan, the Defense Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels tried to send reinforcements to Tando on Sunday, but  
they were repulsed in heavy fighting, the Defense Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian military claimed it carried out 68 bombing runs and  
killed 140 rebels Sunday, many in Tando. The claim could not be 
independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels, who invaded the republic of Dagestan from Chechnya  
on Aug. 7, still hold five villages, according to the Russians. The 
militants say they have even more. However, they have not been able 
to expand their operations beyond the small hamlets they captured 
in their initial assault. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants are fighting for an independent Islamic state in  
southern Russia, but are heavily outgunned by the Russian forces, 
which are believed to number several thousand. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, President Boris Yeltsin held talks on the conflict  
today with Dagestan's leader, Magomedali Magomedov. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Kremlin meeting, Magomedov said Dagestan had warned  
Russian authorities about the possibility of an attack before the 
Aug. 7 invasion. But Russian forces still appeared unprepared when 
the assault came, Magomedov was quoted as saying by the Interfax 
news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, he praised the Kremlin's strong response following  
the rebel incursion. Yeltsin ``has given concrete orders ... for 
the liquidation of the bandits,'' Magomedov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dagestan's secular politicians and moderate religious leaders,  
along wh much of the population, are opposed to the militants. 
</P>
<P>
	Dagestan has been plagued by kidnappings, crime and periodic  
border clashes, all part of the spillover from the war in Chechnya, 
where rebels fought a war against Russia in 1994-96. Chechnya has 
been effectively independent since the end of the war, but Chechen 
leaders have not been able to bring stability to the lawless 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Dagestan, an impoverished Caucasus Mountains region  
west of the Caspian Sea, say more than 11,000 civilians have fled 
the remote, rugged conflict zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dagestan fighting is the worst in Russia since government  
troops withdrew from Chechnya nearly three years ago. The Kremlin 
is pouring soldiers and weaponry into Dagestan but wants to avoid a 
repeat of the Chechnya debacle, particularly ahead of December 
parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials say up to 700 rebels have been killed in the  
two-week conflict, though the rebels say that figure is hugely 
exaggerated. Moscow has acknowledged losing about 40 soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	While support for separatism in Chechnya was widespread, most  
people in Dagestan oppose the militants, and many Muslim leaders in 
Russia have also condemned the rebels' violent tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Dagestani police have been cracking down on Islamic  
fundamentalists, detaining 100 people in the past 10 days and 
seizing religious literature in one home, the ITAR-Tass news agency 
reported.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Golfs on Martha's Vineyard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- On vacation and acting like it,  
President Clinton played golf on Martha's Vineyard for the first 
time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in khaki shorts and a blue sport shirt, Clinton spent  
about 10 minutes at the driving range, then took his first tee shot 
Monday at the Farm Neck Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aw, I killed it. I came over. I need help,'' Clinton said.  
Without asking his partners, he put another ball on the tee to take 
a mulligan, or repeat shot. That ball followed the path of the 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aw, I did it again,'' the president said. He evaluated his  
second effort, pointed to the adjacent tee and said, ``I should 
have teed up over there.'' He drove away with Boston businessman 
Thomas Lee in a golf cart toward their next shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The foursome also included Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and  
New York investment banker Matt Gohd. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Clinton's first golf excursion on Martha's Vineyard since  
his vacation here in 1997. Last year, the president mostly stayed 
indoors with his family, which was reeling after he admitted to the 
nation that he had had a relationship with former White House 
intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	That vacation was not a happy one, but this year the president  
and first lady seem far more relaxed and at ease. He also played 
golf on Friday on Nantucket. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night, they planned to attend a fund-raiser for the  
Martha's Vineyard Hospital, a fifth straight night out on the town. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons were asked to attend by their friend Vernon Jordan,  
said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``He relayed a request 
from the trustees who were doing this fund-raiser ... and the 
president happily agreed to help in this worthwhile effort,'' 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Jordan, too, was a focus of the Lewinsky inquiry,  
questioned by investigators about his efforts to find her a job 
outside the government. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the socialization, the president hasn't had much time  
to dig into the large bag of books he hauled along on this 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	The selections included ``Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story  
of Risk'' by Peter L. Bernstein, a history of risk and probability; 
``Cold Hit,'' the latest Alexandra Cooper book by Linda A. 
Fairstein; ``Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies'' 
by Jared Diamond, and ``Memoirs of Hadrian'' by Marguerite 
Yourcenar, a look at the second century Roman Empire originally 
published in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also brought along Michael Knox Beran's ``The Last  
Patrician: Bobby Kennedy and the End of American Aristocracy'' and 
``Waves of Rancor: Tuning in to the Radical Right'' by Robert 
Hillard and Michael Keith.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Gov. Wants BP to Sell Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles wants BP Amoco  
PLC to sell some of its Alaska holdings and make several other 
concessions before the state will give its blessing to BP's 
acquisition of Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco's purchase of Arco would give the company 70 percent of  
Alaska North Slope oil production, 72 percent ownership of the 
trans-Alaska oil pipeline and 80 percent of the available tanker 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	``This represents an unacceptable monopolistic control of  
Alaska's resources,'' Knowles said Monday in a speech to the 
Anchorage Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	In outlining the state's terms for the proposed merger, Knowles  
said the state wants a say in which North Slope acreage would be 
sold and to whom. He said major oil companies have expressed 
interest in purchasing the North Slope acreage, but did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	State law limits an oil company to 500,000 acres of leased  
exploration land. BP and Arco together hold about 860,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowles also wants BP Amoco to reduce the cost of shipping oil  
down the 800-mile pipeline so that other oil companies can operate 
competitively in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for the merged company to make an increased commitment  
to hiring Alaskans and to the environment and to make a 
``substantial'' endowment to the University of Alaska for technical 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowles said that the state is negotiating with BP on these  
issues and that he is hopeful an agreement could be reached at the 
bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
	If negotiations fail, he said, the state will notify the Federal  
Trade Commission of its opposition to the merger and will look at 
other ways to resolve the disagreement, including efforts in 
Congress, the Alaska Legislature and the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the forums that I think would be least productive,  
but may be necessary,'' Knowles said. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. President Richard Campbell  
disagreed with Knowles' assessment that the proposed takeover is 
anti-competitive and said his company has some concerns about the 
governor's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Campbell sounded confident that the company would come to an  
understanding with the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure we will find a way to agree,'' he said after  
listening to Knowles speech.

<HEADLINE> 'Sixth Sense' Tops Box Office Again / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The supernatural thriller ``The Sixth Sense''  
held on as the top pick for North American moviegoers for a third 
consecutive week, making it the first film to stay at No. 1 for 
that long since ``Star Wars Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sixth Sense'' -- starring Bruce Willis as a therapist  
treating a boy who sees dead people -- earned $24.1 million, pushing 
its gross to $107.7 million in three weeks, according to industry 
estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A different movie had debuted in first place for nine straight  
weekends after ``The Phantom Menace'' fell to second place in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hollywood satire ``Bowfinger,'' meanwhile, held on to second  
place this weekend. Starring Steve Martin as a wannabe director who 
secretly films an action star played by Eddie Murphy, ``Bowfinger'' 
earned $10.7 million in its second week for a total of $35.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' a romantic-comedy starring Hugh Grant as a  
man who discovers his fiancee's father is a mobster, opened in 
third place with a respectable $10.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other new films debuted in the bottom of the top 10.  
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Van Damme's sci-fi adventure ``Universal Soldier:  
The Return'' opened weakly with $4.7 million for seventh place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' a dark comedy about teens who hold  
their teacher hostage, was hampered by bad reviews and criticism of 
its violent content. The film earned a paltry $3.5 million for 
tenth place. 
</P>
<P>
	``People expected 'Tingle' to do really well, but teens don't  
want to see any comedy that has a dark theme. They want 
lighthearted fare or horror films,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, a movie 
analyst with Reel Source Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sixth Sense'' has done well because it takes its somber  
subject matter seriously, yet its PG-13 rating opens it up to a 
broad audience, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting incredible repeat business,'' Bucksbaum said.  
``Nothing else out there is even coming close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Julia Roberts-Richard Gere romance ``Runaway Bride'' was  
fourth with $9.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Blair Witch Project'' slipped to fifth place with $7.1  
million. The low-budget shocker has grossed $120.5 million, since 
it opened in wide release four weeks ago, making it one the most 
successful independent films in history, Bucksbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be doing even better if 'The Sixth Sense' weren't  
there,'' he said. ``That movie is really starting to overshadow 
'Blair Witch.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
were to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $24.1 million.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Released After Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Former NBA star Dennis Rodman was  
released from jail after being arrested on suspicion of 
intoxication in a public place after a verbal confrontation at a 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was released on his own recognizance Sunday, several  
hours after police were called by someone at a restaurant who said 
the flamboyant, tattooed Rodman was causing a disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was booked for investigation of being intoxicated in a  
public place, a misdemeanor, Sgt. Jim Kaminsky said. Rodman was 
ordered to appear in court Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had few details of Saturday night's incident, but the  
restaurant owner said it didn't appear to be instigated by Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I understand, a woman was verbally abusing him, and  
he said something back to her and her boyfriend grabbed him and the 
police were called,'' said Ralph Furra, whose wife, Julie, was 
managing the restaurant at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Rodman outside the restaurant, where he is a  
regular, Furra said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never had any problems with him, he's well-behaved,''  
Furra said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Rodman spent a few hours in custody before being  
released, Kaminsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's agent, Steve Chasman, did not immediately return a  
phone call seeking comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also arrested was Donn Emerson, 36, booked for investigation of  
obstructing a police officer. Details of his involvement and 
relationship to Rodman weren't immediately known, Kaminsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerson also was released on his own recognizance.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman played for the Detroit Pistons, San Antonio Spurs and  
Chicago Bulls before joining the Los Angeles Lakers for a short 
stint this year. The Lakers waived him in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who has made headlines off and on the court for years,  
has been sued twice this year. A Kentucky woman sued him in June, 
claiming he assaulted her in the lobby of a Las Vegas resort. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 19, a casino security guard sued Rodman, accusing him of  
grabbing her breast while she was working at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Three lawsuits filed in Las Vegas in June 1998 involve other  
allegations about Rodman's behavior in casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	A Las Vegas Hilton employee accused him of grabbing her and  
lifting her off the ground in April 1998. A Las Vegas woman accused 
Rodman of sexually assaulting her in April 1998 at the Las Vegas 
Hilton. A craps dealer at The Mirage filed a lawsuit alleging 
Rodman humiliated him at work by rubbing his groin and head.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Soars 199 to Record Close / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average soared to a  
record today as investors banished fears that the Federal Reserve 
will raise interest rates repeatedly in its bid to quell inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow was up 199.15 at  
11,299.76, easily surpassing its July 16 record close of 11,209.84. 
With today's gains, the Dow is up 23 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose sharply, although they remain  
below their record highs of mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	A wide range of stocks rose today, from fledgling Internet  
companies to multinational consumer companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a legitimate, strong demand to own stocks,'' said  
Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the market's rally surprised some analysts who had  
predicted a quiet, lackluster session ahead of the Fed's meeting 
Tuesday. In an effort to contain inflation, the central bank is 
widely expected to raise short-term interest rates a 
quarter-percentage point, following an increase on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Since higher interest rates can cut into corporate profits,  
stocks have faltered since the Fed first raised the possibility of 
a second rate increase. In recent sessions, however, stocks have 
edged back toward record highs as the market absorbed the 
likelihood of higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks are also benefiting from a growing belief that the Fed  
may hold steady after a modest increase on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, we expect a very solid summer rally based on very  
positive earnings reports and growing investor confidence that 
future Fed hikes will likely be moderate,'' said John H. 
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's gains today were broad-based, but driven primarily by  
financial and technology companies. Financial services companies 
like Morgan are especially sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. 
Higher rates make companies less likely to borrow money, cutting 
into lending volume and potentially slowing the pace of mergers and 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were buoying the Nasdaq. Amazon.com and Yahoo  
rose. Many of those stocks have been driven down recently by 
concerns over interest rates as their high prices and often weak 
earnings drove investors in search of more guaranteed investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Merger activity enlivened trading, even as volume remained low  
due to the Fed watch and summer vacations. United Water Resources 
rose after French utility Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux launched a 
$35-per-share bid to acquire full ownership of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
rose 23.61 to 1,360.22, and the Nasdaq composite index rose rose 
71.37 to 2,719.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,723 up, 1,269 down and 550 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 673.76 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
658.10 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.87 to 437.25.

<HEADLINE> Thompson-Thorpe-Heyns Break Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Jenny Thompson rode a ``calm, peaceful  
feeling'' to break Mary T. Meagher's 18-year-old 100-meter 
butterfly record during a record rush at the Pan Pacific swim 
championships today. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 26, was visibly shaken after eclipsing the  
second-oldest record in swimming, set by Meagher on Aug. 16, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	But before the race, Thompson said she underwent a  
transformation which helped her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't even believe it,'' Thompson said. ``I didn't feel  
that great yesterday, this morning or even in the warmup tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then, when I was coming out for the race, I felt that calm,  
peaceful feeling and I knew things were going to be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's Ian Thorpe broke his second world record of the  
meet, in the 200 freestyle, while South Africa's Penny Heyns got 
her fifth world record in five races in the 100 breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, a five-time Olympic gold medalist, had a time of 57.88  
seconds to lower the mark of 57.93 set by Meagher and break the 
fourth world record in two days at the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson has never won an individual gold at an Olympics but is  
favored to take the event in the same pool next year.	   ''The record used to seem like a long shot,'' said Thompson. 
``My time's been dropping little by little and it's seemed more 
like a reality each time. Tonight I didn't know where I was in the 
race but I just kept going and hoped it was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was followed home by Australia's Susie O'Neill who will  
attack the oldest record, Meagher's 200 fly mark set three days 
before the 100 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was awesome, I feel so good for Jenny,'' O'Neill said.  
``She's done it, now I want to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-year-old Thorpe added the 200 record to the 400 he set on  
Sunday. His time of 1 minute, 46.34 seconds came in a semifinal 
heat that included previous record holder Grant Hackett, who went 
1:46.67 earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hackett missed the final and said he might pull out of his  
favored 1,500 event, Thorpe promised he was still not at his peak 
in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still haven't recovered as much as I'd have liked to from  
the 400,'' said Thorpe. ``I'm still a bit worse for wear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heyns broke her fifth record in five races with victory in the  
heat. Her time of 1:06.52 broke her own record of 1:06.95 set at 
the Janet Evans Invitational in Los Angeles on July 19. 
</P>
<P>
	At that meet the Olympic champion broke the 100 and 200 records  
twice each. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you know me you'll know that I quite often run hot in the  
morning, so it wasn't a big surprise,'' Heyns said. ``I never 
really go for a world record, I just go out for a personal best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooke Bennett, the world championship silver medalist, won the  
women's 400 freestyle from fellow American Lindsay Benko. Costa 
Rica's Claudia Poll was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's Matthew Dunn won a thrilling 400 medley final  
against Canada's Curtis Myden, the man who stripped Dunn of the 
Commonwealth record two weeks ago. Dunn charged back from third at 
the final turn to get ahead five meters from the finish. American 
Tom Wilkens, who led with 100 to race, was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's Simon Cowley won the men's 100 breastroke in  
1:02.06, ahead of compatriot Regan Harrison with Canada's Morgan 
Knabe third. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia led the gold standings with four from eight events  
with the U.S. on three and Canada at one.

<HEADLINE>  Rain in Turkey Complicates Rescues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- The skies over northwestern Turkey  
brought the mixed blessing of rain today, washing away dirt and 
dust that could carry disease but also bringing contaminated runoff 
from decomposing corpses into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad weather came as the government began to shift its  
efforts from rescuing the trapped to caring for the survivors of 
Tuesday's 7.4 magnitude quake. Foreign rescue workers began to 
leave as the government insisted it was in control of efforts to 
cope with the country's worst disaster in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chances of survivors is diminishing hour by hour,'' said  
Joseph Uttrect, a Swiss rescue worker who was pulling out today. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts by local searchers pressed on, including the rescue of a  
4-year-old boy who spent 146 hours trapped in Cinarcik, 30 miles 
south of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is in good condition ... He asked for water and told us he  
is hungry,'' said Dr. Yusuf Bahadir, who was with the boy after he 
arrived for treatment in Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	The official casualty count crept higher today to 12,134 dead  
and 33,384 injured. Some politicians and relief leaders have 
estimated as many as 40,000 people may have perished and believe 
thousands of bodies are still entombed by rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	There were signs Turkey was preparing for the worst. The  
government asked the United Nations to help find 45,000 body bags, 
said Sergio Piazzi, head of the European desk at the U.N. Office 
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are shifting from the search and rescue phase to the acute  
emergency phase,'' said Piazzi. ``But still we have hope to find 
some individuals alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each astonishing survivor gave crews hope to press ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	One miraculous rescue came after a son dreamed his mother -- left  
unable to walk or talk by a previous stroke -- was alive in the 
ruins, calling out: ``Come save me!'' Darcan Cetinol's dream drove 
him to urge rescuers to look for Adalet Cetinol, 57, who was found 
Sunday in what's left of Golcuk. 
</P>
<P>
	A 50-year-old woman was also pulled out Sunday by Turkish,  
Israeli and Bulgarian rescue teams, according to the Israeli army. 
</P>
<P>
	Displaced survivors abandoned soggy blankets and mattresses in a  
desperate search for cover from the heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain also complicated efforts to clear the debris and  
continue looking for anyone who defied the odds and survived more 
than six days in the ruins. Rain makes the wreckage heavier and 
increases the risk it could shift and topple onto rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials also feared the rain, which is forecast to  
continue for several days, would bring down toxins pumped into the 
sky by a huge fire that burned for days at Turkey's biggest oil 
refinery. Health Minister Osman Durmus urged people to evacuate the 
area near the refinery in Izmit, 90 miles southeast of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people wore face masks as their only protection against  
potential serious diseases such as typhoid fever and dysentery that 
health workers fear could rampage through the hundreds of thousands 
of weary survivors, some of whom have resorted to washing in pools 
from broken water lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect several tens of thousands to be homeless'' but it's  
too early to say exactly how many were without shelter, Piazzi 
said. The picture was confused by the fact some people were staying 
with relatives or on ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, he said the government had asked for 20,000 tents that  
could accommodate a total of 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The government stepped up efforts to reverse the widespread  
impression that it was slow and disorganized in coping with the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of its strategy has been a large dose of patriotism --  
including from Durmus, who said Sunday that Turkish hospitals can 
handle all the injured and that foreign help, including the U.S. 
warships that arrived today, was not needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The USS Kearsarge and the USS Gunston Hall planned to treat  
earthquake injuries in their operating rooms. The ships also may 
offer fresh water from their desalinization systems, said Lt. Cappy 
Surette, a spokesman for the U.S. 6th Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey's military chief of staff, Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, spent  
Sunday defending the army, the country's most revered institution. 
Many Turks have criticized the military, which appeared to hold off 
on mobilizing soldiers to dig for survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Kivrikoglu said 53,000 soldiers have been involved in the rescue  
efforts, saving 20,000 people trapped in the rubble.

<HEADLINE> Hammer Thrower Celebrates Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Karsten Kobs thought the few hundred  
spectators who stuck around the Estadio Olimpico until midnight to 
watch him win the hammer throw at the World Championship deserved a 
special show. 
</P>
<P>
	So, the 27-year-old German sprinted the length of the field and  
dived into the steeplechase water jump, to the delight of the small 
crowd that stayed behind even after the showcase 100-meter finals 
and the heroics of Maurice Greene and Marion Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I had to do something for the spectators here,''  
Kobs said. ``It was 12 o'clock, they were still here, they had been 
supporting me. I thought just crying or doing a somersault wouldn't 
be enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Kobs plunged headfirst into the pond, remaining there for  
several long moments, emotions catching up with him as tears mixed 
with the water. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have done it at 5 p.m. It was too cold at this  
hour,'' the Dortmund native said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kobs won his first major title after finishing ninth at the  
Athens championship two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning throw of 263 feet, 3 inches was his first of the  
competition, and it stood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the world leader this year and I have a strong mind,''  
Kobs said. ``But the competition was late in the evening and I 
thought the right thing would be to throw big in the first round. 
After my second effort, I knew that I wouldn't be able to throw 
farther. My mind was strong, but my body was weak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hungary's Zsolt Nemeth took the silver medal and Vladislav  
Pinkunov of the Ukraine won the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	As world champion, Kobs succeeded another German, Heinz Weis,  
who failed to qualify for the final. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are good friends, train together and share the same  
coach, Bernhard Riedel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heinz has been giving me tips all year, especially in the last  
few weeks of preparations during joint training sessions,'' Kobs 
said. ``I owe him a lot.''

<HEADLINE> Smith's Agent Talks With Bengals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Akili Smith is a little closer to getting a  
contract agreement with the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Leigh Steinberg flew into Cincinnati on Sunday and held  
several hours of talks with general manager Mike Brown and other 
front-office officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked all day. We made a little progress,'' Steinberg said  
late Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides planned to resume talks today in hopes of breaking  
an impasse that has kept the quarterback from Oregon out of 
training camp and caused him to miss the first two preseason games. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the third overall pick in the draft, has been working out  
on the West Coast while the Bengals lost their first two preseason 
games. They failed to cross Detroit's 40-yard line until the fourth 
quarter of a 16-0 loss Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Bengals have planned all along to use Smith as a  
backup to Jeff Blake this season, the long contract impasse has 
caused him to miss valuable practice time in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did have a month and a half with us (before training camp)  
here, so he would be farther along than somebody who came to 
minicamp and we hadn't seen him since,'' coach Bruce Coslet said. 
``But to say that he would at this point be the No. 2 quarterback, 
I don't know. We'll have to see how fast he learns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has turned into the Bengals' longest contract impasse with a  
quarterback since David Klingler missed most of training camp in 
1992. Klingler also was a Steinberg client. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg got quick deals for first-round picks Dan Wilkinson  
and Ki-Jana Carter in the 1990s, and both got voidable-year deals 
from the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	Unhappy with how those two players have produced, the Bengals  
have insisted on a deal for Smith tied more closely to performance. 
Steinberg has pushed for a deal more like the one that Cleveland 
gave quarterback Tim Couch, taken No. 1 overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess we haven't been willing to necessarily do the Couch or  
(Ryan) Leaf deals and tried to explain to them the reasons why 
not,'' Bengals executive vice president Katherine Blackburn said 
Saturday. ``We've tried to address the problems that come up with 
those contracts in a few different ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before arriving in Cincinnati, Steinberg noted that Smith was  
his last unsigned client. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got 77 players signed and in camp and one out,'' he said.  
``We have nine draft picks signed and one out. It's the same 
person. We've worked hard to have our players signed on time and 
being part of the training camp experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a situation where we simply want Akili salaried in the  
same way that similarly situated quarterbacks have been in recent 
years.''

<HEADLINE> Iraqis Win Discrimination Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Five Iraqi plant workers were awarded  
$30,000 on Monday in a lawsuit claiming they were fired after they 
complained a supervisor told them to take dog food home for their 
friends to eat. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury issued the award against M.I. Industries, which  
makes pet treats from animal byproducts. The men worked there as 
meatcutters. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were treated like animals,'' their lawyer Kathleen Neary  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The men charged that their supervisor, Bill Tobias, did not like  
Iraqis and told them they should bring home cow tendons used to 
make dog chews for their Iraqi friends to eat. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobias, who no longer works for the company, also accused the  
men of being unsanitary, according to the men. The Iraqis said they 
were laid off after they complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Neary said the men were also denied medical attention after  
being injured at work and assigned duties in the most dangerous 
part of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Company president Robert Milligan said the verdict does not  
reflect the way M.I. Industries treats its employees, saying the 
company has a long history of working with employees and customers 
from many different national origins and cultures.

<HEADLINE> Boxer Settles With Ex-Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Boxer Johnny Tapia has settled a  
financial dispute with his former manager for $73,310, avoiding a 
trial that had been scheduled to begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The question was whether a 1995 court settlement that ended  
Tapia's 10-year relationship with manager Paul Chavez was binding. 
The new settlement upholds the old settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Tapia had agreed to pay Chavez a percentage of his  
future boxing purses up to $410,000 as a means of ending their 
professional relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	The $73,310 represents the final installment.  
</P>
<P>
	Tapia's lawyers had contended the 1995 deal was voided by the  
fact that Tapia signed under duress -- at a time when he feared a 
possible prison term for alleged assault with a deadly weapon 
against his wife. His lawyers also contended the agreement was 
reached by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chavez's lawyer, Bryan Query, said it wasn't the kind of  
mistake that would let Tapia off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez earned the money, Query said Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's entitled to it, and now he can enjoy the fruits of his  
labor,'' Query said. 
</P>
<P>
	A message seeking comment was left for Tapia through the office  
of his attorney, Michael Mozes, who also was not immediately 
available for comment, according to Mozes' secretary.

<HEADLINE> Rivals Advise Bush on Drug Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential contender George W.  
Bush is being urged by some of his GOP rivals to get the question 
of illegal drug use behind him by responding to the issue 
forthrightly. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, his competitors and supporters maintained that  
past indiscretions, including possible drug involvement, should not 
disqualify the Texas governor or anyone else from the presidency. 
And they emphasized there is no evidence Bush ever used narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
	But several candidates suggested that a more complete, direct  
response was required. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just answer the darn question and get rid of it,'' Sen. Orrin  
Hatch, R-Utah, said as the issue dominated the Sunday television 
talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said Bush opened the way for inquiries by giving partial  
answers. ``If there wasn't anything here, then George Bush should 
have just said there wasn't,'' Hatch said on NBC's ``Meet the 
Press.'' ``If there was, I think he, at this point, should answer 
it, get it behind him, because the polls show most of the American 
people are forgiving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush, 53, has acknowledged he once drank heavily and made  
``mistakes'' in his youth, there has been no evidence or even 
credible allegation that he ever has used cocaine or any other 
illegal drug. When pressed on the matter last week, he gave varying 
answers and finally said he had not used illegal drugs in the past 
25 years. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a right to privacy,'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,  
another GOP presidential contender, said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' 
He declined to say whether Bush should address the issue further. 
</P>
<P>
	But another Republican hopeful, conservative activist Gary  
Bauer, said Bush and other candidates should ``have to answer 
questions that go to law-breaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think anything that involves a felony, I don't see how you  
can get away with'' not answering such questions directly, Bauer 
said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle, another rival for the GOP  
presidential nomination, said he admired Bush for trying to draw a 
line by not discussing his private life, but he ``opened the door a 
bit'' for further inquiries by giving partial answers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once he started talking about it, you really probably are  
somewhat obliged to answer these questions,'' Quayle said on ABC's 
``This Week.'' Still, he called the issue of Bush's past 
indiscretions ``a sideshow'' in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said Republicans have a duty to give clear answers on the  
drug issue. ``We went nuts when Bill Clinton said he tried 
marijuana and didn't inhale. There were a lot of people in my party 
... that just pounded on that for months and months and months,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for Bush, all of the GOP candidates have said  
unequivocally that they have never used illegal drugs. Vice 
President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, rivals for the 
Democratic presidential nomination, both have admitted 
experimenting with marijuana during their youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told CNN that the  
drug questions were legitimate but that Bush need not be compelled 
to provide answers. ``I do think that the American people ought to 
hear a lot more about his past and about his positions,'' Daschle 
added. ``They haven't heard much yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But two Republican governors -- Frank Keating of Oklahoma and Tom  
Ridge of Pennsylvania, both strong Bush supporters -- said their 
colleague had sufficiently answered the questions about drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care what somebody did in college as long as he didn't  
kill somebody,'' Keating told ABC. ``He's taken his stand and we 
ought to move on,'' Ridge said on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a Fox News-Opinion Dynamics poll found that 72  
percent of those surveyed said experimental drug use while young 
should be forgiven, but 69 percent said they would want to know 
about a candidate's past cocaine use. The poll had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Opposition Denies Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An opposition faction pushing for  
President Slobodan Milosevic's ouster denied charges today by a 
rival opposition leader that the movement sought civil war in 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Alliance for Change, said:  
``There could be clashes, but not big ones like a civil war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Ironically, Milosevic has done something positive during his  
10-year rule: he has united the people in poverty, discontent and 
hopelessness,'' Djindjic told independent B2-92 radio. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there was no danger that people would fight each other  
over Milosevic, but if there was violence it would be Milosevic's 
regime cracking down on people. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unprecedented attack Sunday, opposition leader Vuk  
Draskovic accused the opposition of fomenting civil war, and 
Western countries of seeking to set up ``a large Albanian Islamic 
state in the Balkans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Under that scenario, the moment the civil war starts, they  
would again flee abroad and wait for the war to end,'' Draskovic 
said, referring to Djindjic, who left Serbia during the recent NATO 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then NATO comes and runs over Serbia in the role of  
peacekeepers. They (the coalition leaders) would, of course, come 
on NATO tanks,'' Draskovic said in a television interview late 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The clash between Draskovic and Djindjic, who in 1996-97 led the  
most massive protests against Milosevic, has split opposition 
efforts to oust the Yugoslav president. 
</P>
<P>
	Draskovic is calling for early ``democratic elections'' in  
Serbia, while Djindjic and the coalition are saying there could be 
no free and fair vote with Milosevic in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Djindjic and other coalition members have accused Draskovic of  
helping Milosevic dodge widespread demands for his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The precondition is that Milosevic goes,'' Batic said.  
</P>
<P>
	The opposition groups have gained new strength this year in the  
wake of Serbia's defeat against NATO, which led to the loss of 
Kosovo, and continued economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition has spearheaded intense anti-Milosevic rallies,  
held daily in all Serbian cities since June, with thousands 
demanding his resignation.

<HEADLINE>  Dow in Record Territory at 11,227.26 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved sharply higher today, pushing the  
Dow Jones industrial average into record territory a day before the 
Federal Reserve was to announce whether it will raise interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow was up 126.65  
at 11,227.26, above its July 16 record close of 11,209.84. Earlier 
in the session, the blue-chip index traded as high as the 11,252 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 16.59 at 1,353.20, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 52.68 at 2,701.01. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's Open Market Committee meets Tuesday, and most  
economists predict the central bank will raise short-term interest 
rates a quarter-percentage point. In its bid to keep inflation from 
accelerating, the Fed also raised rates on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Since higher interest rates can cut into corporate profits,  
stocks have faltered since the Fed first raised the possibility of 
a second rate increase. In recent sessions, however, stocks have 
edged back toward record highs as the market absorbed the 
likelihood of higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks are also benefiting from a growing belief that the Fed  
may hold steady after a modest increase on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, we expect a very solid summer rally based on very  
positive earnings reports and growing investor confidence that 
future Fed hikes will likely be moderate,'' said John H. 
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's gains today were broad-based. J.P. Morgan, up 4 1/4 to  
137 3/16, and IBM, up 2 to 123 3/4, led the gainers. Financial 
services companies like Morgan are especially sensitive to interest 
rate fluctuations. Higher rates make companies less likely to 
borrow money, cutting into lending volume and potentially slowing 
the pace of mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were buoying the Nasdaq. Amazon.com was up 3  
9/16 to 117, and Yahoo rose 5 9/16 to 150 9/16. Many of those 
stocks have been driven down recently by concerns over interest 
rates as their high prices and often weak earnings drove investors 
in search of more guaranteed investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Merger activity enlivened trading, even as volume remained low  
due to the Fed watch and summer vacations. United Water Resources 
rose 2 3/8 to 33 7/16 after French utility Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux 
launched a $35-per-share bid to acquire full ownership of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-8 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 506.81 million 
shares, behind Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, measuring the performance of smaller  
companies, rose 1.84 to 436.22.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `The Muse' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Like men who get drunk on grape juice thinking it's wine,  
filmmakers in Albert Brooks' ``The Muse'' are inspired by a diva 
who they believe is truly one of the Greek gods of creativity. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to this ``Muse,'' played by Sharon Stone and conducting  
business like the most pampered of starlets, we have James 
Cameron's ``Titanic,'' Rob Reiner's ``The American President'' and 
any number of Martin Scorsese movies. The Muse's worshippers arrive 
bearing trinkets from Tiffany and come away with advice they 
treasure like oracles. ``Stay away from the water,'' she urges 
Cameron, desperate for a followup to his blockbuster movie. 
</P>
<P>
	That Cameron, Reiner and Scorsese all make cameos in ``The  
Muse'' is a sign of how Hollywood adores Brooks, the poet of yuppie 
neurosis, and how it adores making fun of it itself. Brooks is 
clearly happy to reciprocate. 
</P>
<P>
	He stars as Steven Phillips, a middle-aged screenwriter once  
nominated for an Academy Award. The film begins with Steven 
receiving a ``humanitarian'' prize. Asked later by his daughter 
just why he was so honored, his response is realistic: Because he 
never won the Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	In his acceptance speech, Steven likens the screenwriter's  
status in Hollywood to a eunuch at an orgy. The next day, he will 
be banished from the palace altogether. His boss tells him he's 
``losing his edge'' and fires him (Brian De Palma needs his 
office). When he arrives on the lot of a rival studio, where he 
thinks he has a meeting with Steven Spielberg, he is told he has no 
``drive on'' privileges and must walk to Spielberg's office 
instead. The walk is nine miles. 
</P>
<P>
	With a wife (Andie MacDowell) and two kids to support, Steven  
begs for help from a more successful screenwriter (Jeff Bridges), 
who lets him in on the dirty secret: He owes it all to a ``Muse,'' 
named Sarah. Steven, too, can drink from the magic fountain, but 
the price is high: Sarah demands a fancy hotel suite, food, 
clothes, car service and Steven's constant availability, which 
includes a late-night delivery of Waldorf salad. Getting help from 
her proves no easier than arranging a meeting with Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
	An ingenious (yes, inspired) story on paper, ``The Muse'' feels  
like one of those films that was more fun to make than it is to 
watch. The actors, especially Stone, get a kick from sending up 
their peers (and themselves), but what they give us is an orgy of 
inside Hollywood jokes. The biggest laughs come early. After that, 
outsiders can only look on like so many eunuchs. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks sends up Hollywood superstition and, perhaps, his own  
reputation. The self-destructive whiners he played in ``Modern 
Romance'' and ``Lost in America'' are slightly better adjusted, and 
slightly less edgy, in ``Defending Your Life'' and ``Mother.'' The 
old Albert Brooks dreamed big and ended up where he started. The 
new Albert Brooks gets wise and moves on. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of that ``edge'' is back in ``The Muse,'' but the movie is  
still pretty soft compared to Brooks' earlier work and to such 
Hollywood satires as ``The Player'' and Steve Martin's 
``Bowfinger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Muse'' is an intelligent, undemanding comedy. Maybe this  
was the message all along: In Hollywood, even the gods are just too 
laid-back. 
</P>
<P>
	An October Films release, ``The Muse'' was directed by Brooks  
and co-written by Brooks and Monica Johnson. Herb Nanas was the 
producer. The film runs 97 minutes and is rated PG-13, with adult 
situations and the briefest of nude scenes, featuring the famously 
R-rated Ms. Stone.

<HEADLINE>  Dow in Record Territory at 11,227.26 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved sharply higher today, pushing the  
Dow Jones industrial average into record territory a day before the 
Federal Reserve was to announce whether it will raise interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow was up 126.65  
at 11,227.26, above its July 16 record close of 11,209.84. Earlier 
in the session, the blue-chip index traded as high as the 11,252 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 16.59 at 1,353.20, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 52.68 at 2,701.01. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's Open Market Committee meets Tuesday, and most  
economists predict the central bank will raise short-term interest 
rates a quarter-percentage point. In its bid to keep inflation from 
accelerating, the Fed also raised rates on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Since higher interest rates can cut into corporate profits,  
stocks have faltered since the Fed first raised the possibility of 
a second rate increase. In recent sessions, however, stocks have 
edged back toward record highs as the market absorbed the 
likelihood of higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks are also benefiting from a growing belief that the Fed  
may hold steady after a modest increase on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, we expect a very solid summer rally based on very  
positive earnings reports and growing investor confidence that 
future Fed hikes will likely be moderate,'' said John H. 
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's gains today were broad-based. J.P. Morgan, up 4 1/4 to  
137 3/16, and IBM, up 2 to 123 3/4, led the gainers. Financial 
services companies like Morgan are especially sensitive to interest 
rate fluctuations. Higher rates make companies less likely to 
borrow money, cutting into lending volume and potentially slowing 
the pace of mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were buoying the Nasdaq. Amazon.com was up 3  
9/16 to 117, and Yahoo rose 5 9/16 to 150 9/16. Many of those 
stocks have been driven down recently by concerns over interest 
rates as their high prices and often weak earnings drove investors 
in search of more guaranteed investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Merger activity enlivened trading, even as volume remained low  
due to the Fed watch and summer vacations. United Water Resources 
rose 2 3/8 to 33 7/16 after French utility Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux 
launched a $35-per-share bid to acquire full ownership of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-8 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 506.81 million 
shares, behind Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, measuring the performance of smaller  
companies, rose 1.84 to 436.22.

<HEADLINE> Inmates Enjoy New Quarters: Tents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPARTA, Ga. (AP) -- When inmates at Hancock State Prison heard of  
plans to erect tents to help with overcrowding, they debated 
whether it was cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they're practically standing in line to get assigned to  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, the insulated canvas structures are air  
conditioned, while the main prison has only fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first heard about it, I thought it would be hotter than  
the regular cells, but out of all the places I've been, this is 
definitely the nicest and the most relaxed,'' said Eric Willis, who 
has seen the inside of four different prisons since he began a 
10-year sentence for drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison officials moved 168 inmates into the insulated tents of  
``J Unit'' earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally planned as a temporary measure, the move created an  
unexpected benefit: Inmates like 29-year-old Willis, just eight 
months away from release, are willing to behave to get assigned to 
the unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Inmates at Hancock, about 90 miles east of Atlanta, are put  
through a tough screening process before they are allowed into the 
tents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last month, we only had two discipline reports filed, out of  
all 168 inmates,'' J Unit manager Dwayne Johnson said. ``They know 
that if they act out, they're gone. And they want to stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, this is definitely a perk,'' said inmate Larry Gibbins,  
55, who is in the fourth year of a 20-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said that although the tents initially were considered a  
quick fix, ``we got a deal on them,'' and they have worked out much 
better than officials thought. 
</P>
<P>
	The four tents -- three for housing and one for a dining hall --  
and a cinderblock administrative building cost about $514,000, or 
$2,763 per bed, according to Corrections Department spokesman Scott 
Stallings. A new prison with 1,000 beds costs about $32 million, 
about $32,000 a bed. 
</P>
<P>
	The tents look more like doublewide mobile homes than something  
you'd camp in. The canvas walls are held up by steel poles. They 
stand on concrete slabs buffed so frequently they shine brighter 
than linoleum. Johnson hopes the tents last up to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Each houses up to 65 inmates sleeping on rows of bunk beds and  
is attached to its own cinderblock bathroom and shower area. 
Features include fluorescent lights and two televisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Inmates are free to mingle in a common area or at each other's  
bunks, and the air conditioners keep the temperature in the tents 
in the 70s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything around here is concrete, and it can still be over  
100 degrees in the main building after 10 p.m.,'' Gibbins said. 
``This is a nice alternative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These aren't the only tents in use at prisons, but they are  
among the nicest. Inmates sentenced to a boot camp elsewhere in 
Georgia are put in Army surplus tents as punishment. And in 
Arizona, Maricopa County puts jail inmates in two-man tents in the 
blistering Phoenix heat as both punishment and to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison rights advocates say the fact that the Hancock tents had  
to be built at all shows that the system can't cope with rising 
inmate numbers brought by increasingly tough sentencing laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't build yourself out of the overcrowding problem,  
because only more and more prisoners are going to go to jail,'' 
said Kara Gotsch, public policy coordinator for the American Civil 
Liberties Union National Prison Project. ``We really need to be 
exploring alternative sanctions.''

<HEADLINE> Farm Equipment Sales Being Cut / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Low commodity prices are stretching  
beyond the fields and into the factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry projections show some farm equipment sales being cut by  
one-third this year. Tractor and combine manufacturers are scaling 
back production. 
</P>
<P>
	Needing their money for other things, farmers are making do with  
older equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many cases, the purchase of a piece of machinery is''  
postponed, said Emmett Barker, president of the Equipment 
Manufacturers Institute in Chicago. ``But you cannot plant corn 
without corn seed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barker's group projects U.S. sales of four-wheel-drive tractors  
declining 32.4 percent this year. Combine sales are expected to 
plummet 36.7 percent, it says. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of orders coming in has forced equipment manufacturers  
to put on the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporting a 76 percent drop in third-quarter earnings, Deere &AMP;  
Co. said last week it would periodically shut down its major U.S. 
farm equipment plants through October. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the Moline, Ill.-based company -- which is Iowa's  
largest manufacturing employer -- had announced a 25 percent 
shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee-based Case Corp., poised to merge with New Holland NV  
of the Netherlands, has taken similar steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've geared our factories down and had periodic shutdowns to  
reflect that demand has decreased,'' said Rick Bruck of Newton, a 
business manager for Case in central Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of our business is eight to nine months out, and it gets  
pretty foggy at times,'' he said. ``When farmers have good cash 
flow, it's easier for our dealers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many smaller manufacturers, as well as the companies that supply  
parts for the industry, have scaled back. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week in Des Moines, Firestone reported lower sales of farm  
implement tires and announced production cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Lewis, an Omaha, Neb.-based district sales manager for  
Kinze Manufacturing Inc. of Williamsburg, oversees an area 
encompassing Nebraska and Kansas, northwestern Missouri and western 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers concerned about low crop prices have gone into a holding  
pattern, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys could hold off three or four years and not be  
trading tractors,'' he said. ``There's so many unknown factors ... 
A lot of these farmers are very concerned about what's going to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Iowa State Fair, which ended Sunday in Des Moines,  
fairgoers walked through a tent behind the Varied Industries 
Building where shiny tractors and other implements beckoned to 
farmers who could not afford them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things you buy cost too much and things you sell don't bring  
enough,'' said Lowell Sherwood, whose son and son-in-law farm near 
Brooklyn and Victor, Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jumps 85 in Early Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher today, with technology  
shares showing surprising strength a day before the Federal Reserve 
announces whether it will raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 85.17 at 11,185.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 10.55 at 1,347.16, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 32.11 at 2,680.44. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's Open Market Committee meets Tuesday, and most  
economists predict the central bank will raise short-term interest 
rates a quarter-percentage point. Since higher interest rates can 
cut into corporate profits, stocks have faltered since the Fed 
first raised the possibility of a rate increase in July. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent sessions, however, stocks have edged back toward

This morning, the Dow was within 25 points of its July 16 record

	``Dark Side of the Spoon'' (Warner Bros.) -- Ministry  

</P>
<P>
	Ministry helped create industrial in the late 1980s,  
representing the darker side of the genre with rage-filled power 
chords and twisted yet funny lyrics that helped keep it from 
descending into disco noir. 
</P>
<P>
	But that genre has not only been receiving a lot of bad press  
since the recent school shootings; it has hit a creative wall as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Sparked by the creative duo Al Jourgensen and Paul Barker,  
Ministry lashes right back with ``Dark Side of the Spoon,'' a 
collage of sounds that swirl into a disturbing yet at times 
appealing melange that always has a pop groove buried somewhere 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The band is at its best on ``Eureka Pile,'' a tune that somehow  
manages to be hypnotic yet abrasive with its killer bass hook and 
wah-wah guitar that sounds like a Metallica riff sampled over and 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nursing Home'' relies on a banjo loop for its rhythm guitar  
and features a squawking saxophone that fits right in to the 
seven-minute head-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
	The band even takes on critics of heavy music in ``Vex &AMP;  
Siolence,'' saying that children are made angry by how they are 
treated, not by the music they listen to or the movies they watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dark Side of the Spoon'' represents not only a rebirth for  
Ministry, but a new step for the music they helped define. 
</P>

<P>
	``Souvenir'' (Windham Hill Jazz) -- Ricky Peterson  

</P>
<P>
	For most of his career, Ricky Peterson has been the ``other  
guy'' -- the keyboardist accompanying artists such as Prince, David 
Sanborn and Bonnie Raitt. 
</P>
<P>
	And on his fourth solo effort, Peterson's willingness to show  
his own identity is felt right away with the funky opener ``Drop 
Shot,'' a cut that incorporates the Minneapolis sound he is known 
for. 
</P>
<P>
	But things quickly go downhill from there, leaving it hard to  
discern who Peterson is as a musician. A by-the-numbers cover of 
Todd Rundgren's ``Can We Still Be Friends'' gives no new meaning to 
the cut, and another ill-advised ballad, ``Soft Touch,'' sounds 
embarrassingly close to Muzak. 
</P>
<P>
	The only places where the studio vet shows any creativity comes  
when he picks up the pace. Peterson shows that he knows his way 
around the keyboard on ``Souvenir.'' But it's a fine line between 
musicianship and artistry, a lesson Peterson apparently hasn't 
learned from his previous collaborators.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Released After Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Former NBA star Dennis Rodman was  
released from jail after being arrested on suspicion of 
intoxication in a public place after a verbal confrontation at a 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was released on his own recognizance Sunday, several  
hours after police were called by someone at a restaurant who said 
the flamboyant, tattooed Rodman was causing a disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was booked for investigation of being intoxicated in a  
public place, a misdemeanor, Sgt. Jim Kaminsky said. Rodman was 
ordered to appear in court Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had few details of Saturday night's incident, but the  
restaurant owner said it didn't appear to be instigated by Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I understand, a woman was verbally abusing him, and  
he said something back to her and her boyfriend grabbed him and the 
police were called,'' said Ralph Furra, whose wife, Julie, was 
managing the restaurant at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Rodman outside the restaurant, where he is a  
regular, Furra said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never had any problems with him, he's well-behaved,''  
Furra said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Rodman spent a few hours in custody before being  
released, Kaminsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's agent, Steve Chasman, did not immediately return a  
phone call seeking comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also arrested was Donn Emerson, 36, booked for investigation of  
obstructing a police officer. Details of his involvement and 
relationship to Rodman weren't immediately known, Kaminsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerson also was released on his own recognizance.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman played for the Detroit Pistons, San Antonio Spurs and  
Chicago Bulls before joining the Los Angeles Lakers for a short 
stint this year. The Lakers waived him in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who has made headlines off and on the court for years,  
has been sued twice this year. A Kentucky woman sued him in June, 
claiming he assaulted her in the lobby of a Las Vegas resort. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 19, a casino security guard sued Rodman, accusing him of  
grabbing her breast while she was working at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Three lawsuits filed in Las Vegas in June 1998 involve other  
allegations about Rodman's behavior in casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	A Las Vegas Hilton employee accused him of grabbing her and  
lifting her off the ground in April 1998. A Las Vegas woman accused 
Rodman of sexually assaulting her in April 1998 at the Las Vegas 
Hilton. A craps dealer at The Mirage filed a lawsuit alleging 
Rodman humiliated him at work by rubbing his groin and head.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Opposes N. Korea Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea today stepped up  
diplomatic efforts to stop North Korea from launching a new 
ballistic missile by holding high-level talks with China and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean Foreign Minister Hong Soon-young met his Japanese  
counterpart, Masahiko Komura, today in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing, the defense chiefs of China and South Korea also  
opened talks -- the first ever meeting between defense ministers of 
the two former Korean War adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, South Korea's Unification Minister Lim Dong-won left  
Seoul for a weeklong visit to the United States, which includes 
talks with former Defense Secretary William Perry, Washington's 
point man on North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-pronged South Korean efforts have the same agenda:  
what carrot it and the other two allies could offer if North Korea 
decides not to launch a missile experts say could reach Hawaii and 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea has reportedly completed preparations to test-fire a  
long-range missile, but has expressed willingness to negotiate in 
response to international appeals and warnings to scrap the launch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are always ready for negotiation if the hostile nations  
honestly ask for it out of an intention to alleviate our concern,'' 
a spokesman of the North's Foreign Ministry said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The unidentified spokesman said his country developed missiles  
because the United States wants to invade the North and has 
deployed a large number of weapons and troops in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts believe the North wants economic and political benefits  
in return for holding off on a test, which many fear would unsettle 
security in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean officials attached special significance to the  
meeting between their defense minister, Cho Sung-tae, and his 
Chinese counterpart, Chi Haotian. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries have shed much of their Cold War enmity  
through economic links. They are now each other's third-largest 
trading partners, with a trade volume of $23.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Chi told Cho he hoped that tensions between North and South  
Korea would subside and that the peninsula would become ``a 
nuclear-free region,'' Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chi, who led a Chinese battalion against U.S. and South Korean  
forces during the Korean War, also indirectly warned Seoul against 
enhancing military ties with the United States, Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid offending Beijing's longtime ally North Korea, China  
gave the meetings little publicity in its entirely state-controlled 
media. Government officials of both countries declined to answer 
reporters' questions about Cho's trip. 
</P>
<P>
	China remains North Korea's last remaining major communist ally.  
But their relations have cooled since Beijing opened formal 
relations with Seoul in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea believes Beijing is in the best position among major  
powers to persuade Pyongyang to forgo the reported missile launch. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the Japanese and South Korean foreign ministers agreed  
there were signs North Korea may be ready for dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has openly threatened economic penalties if the launch  
takes place, possibly including a ban on hundreds of millions of 
dollars sent by pro-North Korea Korean residents of Japan to their 
impoverished homeland each year. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Francisco, Lim was scheduled to meet Perry later this  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting comes amid reports that the United States has  
offered North Korea wide-ranging economic and political benefits if 
Pyongyang holds off on a missile test.

<HEADLINE> Maddux Has Chipped Wrist Bone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- After an MRI confirmed that 16-game winner Greg  
Maddux has a chipped bone in his pitching wrist, teammate Rudy 
Seanez joined the growing list of Braves on the disabled list 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the often-injured Seanez bothered by pain his right elbow  
the last few days, doctors performed a bone scan and discovered a 
stress fracture. He was placed on the 15-day DL and David Cortes, 
who has 22 saves at Triple-A Richmond, will join the Braves for 
Tuesday's game against Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Seanez, making his seventh trip to the DL, was 6-1 with a 3.35  
ERA and three saves in 56 games, serving in a valuable set-up role 
out of the Braves bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll come back,'' said Seanez, whose stint on the DL  
is retroactive to Saturday, a day after his last appearance. ``I've 
been through this too many times to let it get me down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seanez is the latest Brave to go down in a season filled with  
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	During spring training, the Braves lost leading hitter Andres  
Galarraga (cancer) and closer Kerry Ligtenberg (elbow) for the 
whole season. Then, catcher Javy Lopez (knee) and pitcher Odalis 
Perez (elbow) sustained season-ending injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, starter John Smoltz has been hampered by a sore elbow all  
season, prompting him to alter his delivery, while Brian Jordan has 
been bothered by a sore wrist and Kevin Millwood's back in aching. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux was injured Saturday in a victory over San Diego while  
trying to catch a foul popup. He underwent an MRI on Monday, which 
confirmed a badly sprained wrist and a chip in the olecranon bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux is still is not sure if he'll be able to make his next  
scheduled start, at St. Louis on Friday night. After Atlanta's 6-2 
victory over the Reds, though, he sounded optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels a lot better,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Maddux (16-6, 3.61 ERA) was tied for the NL lead in wins at the  
beginning of the day despite allowing a league-high 213 hits. He 
has won six straight starts since his last loss, at Florida on July 
21. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the string of injuries, the Braves held a half-game lead  
over the New York Mets in the NL East and the best record in the 
league.

<HEADLINE> Filene's Basement Files for Ch. 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Filene's Basement Corp., the storied Massachusetts  
discount clothing chain, filed for federal bankruptcy protection 
Monday in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wellesley, Mass.-based company said the Chapter 11 filing  
was prompted by low inventory caused by vendors who refused to 
deliver merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said all of its stores will continue to operate  
pending the development of a reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Barnard, president of the newsletter Barnard's Retail Trend  
Report in Upper Montclair, N.J., said the filing was not 
surprising, but part of the ``gradual demise'' of Filene's 
Basement, once a haven for bargain hunters. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have lost their ability to compete on two fronts: for  
consumers and for merchandise,'' said Barnard. ``Filene's Basement 
was once upon a time, decades ago, a hallowed name in discount 
retailing. But all that remains today is the name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnard said the Basement simply couldn't keep up with newer  
discount-clothing titans such as the Framingham-based TJX Companies 
Inc., which operates more than 1,000 stores in North America and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Filene's Basement had previously tried to improve merchandising  
and operations and to enhance financial performance with measures 
that included laying off 15 percent of its headquarters staff. 
</P>
<P>
	It said it has secured a financing commitment for $135 million  
from General Electric Capital Corp. and Paragon Capital LLC, 
subject to bankruptcy court approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Filene's Basement has 51 locations in Massachusetts and 13 other  
states. Earlier this year, the company opened a four-store chain of 
warehouse stores called Aisle 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced a $6.4 million quarterly loss in May, and  
its stock has been sinking for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Filene's Basement stock was halted at 91 cents in trading on the  
Nasdaq Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Insurer Says Doctor Made Up Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- A doctor submitted more than $780,000 in  
bogus medical bills for 138 auto accident victims to Prudential 
Property and Casualty Insurance Company of New Jersey, the insurer 
said in a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Vogel provided copies of identical diagnostic tests that  
determined nerve damage to the neck, arms and legs for all 138 
patients, Prudential charged in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests are like fingerprints, and vary according to patients'  
height, weight and medical problem, said Frank Baggett, 
Prudential's vice president of Casualty Claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Vogel also falsified his reports and billed the insurer  
excessively, Prudential said in the lawsuit filed Friday in state 
Superior Court here. 
</P>
<P>
	In another lawsuit filed earlier this month, the Holmdel-based  
subsidiary of Newark-based Prudential Insurance Company of America 
accused 182 people, including 19 policyholders, of filing $1.4 
million in false claims from car accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Vogel, who operates the Neurological Associates of Northern New  
Jersey in Glen Ridge, Jersey City, Passaic and Rahway, was on sick 
leave, his secretary said Monday.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Hopeful Chafee Admits Drug Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Lincoln Chafee, who is seeking to  
succeed his father as senator from Rhode Island, has admitted to 
trying cocaine while a college student in the 1970s. A second 
hopeful said he tried marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's important to put it into perspective -- I tried  
it,'' Chafee, 46, told WJAR-TV in an interview that aired Sunday. 
``It's not something I'm proud of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee, the mayor of Warwick, said he decided to speak publicly  
about his cocaine use following ``dogged'' questioning about 
whether Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush used 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	An interviewer posed the question to Chafee during the Friday  
taping of a news show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had three choices -- lie, which was not an option, or evade  
it and receive the consequences of that, or be honest. And I chose 
to be honest,'' Chafee told The Associated Press from his home 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee said he tried cocaine while a student at Brown  
University. He graduated in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee is the sole Republican running for the Senate seat. The  
race has also attracted Rep. Robert Weygand, D-R.I., former 
Democratic Lt. Gov. Richard Licht, and former state Attorney 
General Arlene Violet, who may run as an independent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Providence Journal reported today that Weygand admitted to  
experimenting with marijuana -- but not heroin or cocaine -- while at 
the University of Rhode Island. Licht and Violet both said they had 
never used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee acknowledged that his admission could hurt his candidacy  
if voters hold him to the wholesome image of his father, John 
Chafee, a former Boy Scout and World War II hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something positive for my record,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Said Violet: ``I think his personal involvement with cocaine is  
going to be between him and the voters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Chaffee announced earlier this year that he would not  
seek a fifth term as senator in 2000. Chaffee, 76, was secretary of 
the Navy and a three-term Rhode Island governor before he became a 
senator.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Push Dollar Mostly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against most currencies Monday,  
with sharp gains against the euro and British pound, as U.S. stocks 
surged. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar but fell slightly against the yen on optimism  
about Japan's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0505, down  
from $1.0668 Friday. The dollar also was quoted at 111.44 yen, down 
slightly from 111.52 yen but well above the seven-month low of 
110.60 yen reached early in the day in Tokyo trading. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Dow Jones industrial average surged almost 200 points to  
a new record, confidence in the U.S. stock market surged and 
investors bought dollars to purchase U.S. shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains came despite the widespread belief that the Federal  
Reserve will raise interest rates one-quarter percentage point on 
Tuesday, the second rate increase of the summer. Stocks were lifted 
on the perception that a relatively small increase would signal to 
the world's financial markets that the U.S. economy is on the right 
track and that U.S. inflation is essentially benign. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Bernzweig, a foreign exchange trader at Bank Leumi in New  
York said traders seem comfortable with the prospect of a 
quarter-point increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market seems to be saying, `We can handle that,''' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen continued to gain against the dollar on renewed optimism  
for Japan's economy. The Nikkei index, Japan's benchmark stock 
index, rose 135.44 points Monday, adding to Friday's 218-point 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5236 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4957, and 1.4979 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4964. The British 
pound fell to $1.6026 from $1.6142. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8620 German 
marks, up from 1.8334; 6.2449 French francs, up from 6.1491; and 
1,843 Italian lire, up from 1,815.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Bret Weakens in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVIERA, Texas (AP) -- A blustery shadow of its former self,  
Hurricane Bret plodded across a sparsely populated swath of 
southern Texas today after riding ashore with less might than 
forecasters had feared. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm, the biggest hurricane to strike Texas in nearly 20  
years, continued to drench the region with thunderous squalls, but 
no injuries were reported since Bret made landfall about 6 p.m. 
Sunday in sparsely populated Kenedy County. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 25 inches of rain had fallen in the county by early today  
and flooding was expected, the National Weather Service said. Some 
roofs were blown off in Falfurrias as the storm moved inland this 
morning, the weather service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Texas  
Division of Emergency Management and the Texas Department of Public 
Safety prepared this morning to move into the storm-blown areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first daylight, there will be preliminary damage assessment  
teams that will go into the area and begin to inspect the damage,'' 
FEMA spokesman Brad Craine said today. 
</P>
<P>
	As of 6 a.m. EDT today, Bret remained a Category 1 hurricane --  
the weakest of five possible strengths -- with 85 mph winds. The 
former Category 4 storm made landfall with winds blowing at 125 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Bret unleashed its power on the deserted Padre Island  
National Seashore, 70 miles south of Corpus Christi, before 
continuing into desolate, sparsely populated ranch land. 
</P>
<P>
	The center of Bret moved inland over Brooks County as it headed  
west toward Mexico at 5 mph. Hurricane warnings along the coast 
were downgraded to tropical storm warnings this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of residents from Brownsville to Corpus Christi had  
fled north and west as the hurricane approached. Windows throughout 
the region were taped and boarded in anticipation of the worst 
storm since Hurricane Allen, another Category 4 storm that struck 
roughly the same area in 1980, causing $55 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was overpublicized,'' said Ralph Huff, who defied  
conventional wisdom -- and an evacuation order -- and stayed in his 
cinder block home overlooking Baffin Bay, just east of this small 
agricultural town. His phone and power were still working late 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the storm's center passing less than 10 miles to the  
south, ``there wasn't even any storm surge,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 125 mph winds, with gusts blowing even higher, extended 40  
miles out from the storm when it first hit land. Forecasters feared 
possible tornadoes, a foot or more of rain and a storm surge that 
could approach 10 to 15 feet as it moved over land. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the tightly-focused storm made land, National Weather  
Service forecaster Jim Hoke said it had ``clear potential of 
producing major disaster.'' He compared the storm to Hurricane 
Andrew, which battered Florida in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	As Bret arrived, whitecaps crashed into Corpus Christi's seawall  
and palm trees along the cost bent and frayed with the gusts. A few 
surfers in Corpus Christi even took to the storm-fed waves. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who fled, shelters were set up inland in San Antonio,  
and hotels offered discounts for evacuees with proof of residence. 
</P>
<P>
	A few stragglers stayed behind on the Padre and Mustang barrier  
islands after all access to the mainland was severed. The incoming 
storm, coupled with high tide, threatened to cause coastal 
flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush said he would sign disaster proclamations  
for seven counties: Aransas, San Patricio, Kenedy, Cameron, 
Willacy, Nueces and Kleberg. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton issued a major disaster declaration Sunday  
night for the seven counties, freeing funds to help local 
governments with emergency supplies and debris removal, said FEMA 
Director James Lee Witt. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas hadn't been hit by a hurricane since Hurricane Jerry  
killed three people in October 1989. However, the state's 
367-mile-long coast has been struck by tropical storms since then, 
including Charley, which dumped 18 inches of rain and killed 19 
people after it moved inland in August 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Bret initially had been expected to head for Mexico's northern  
coast. But after the storm turned toward southern Texas, Mexico got 
little more than strong wind and warm rain.

<HEADLINE> Study: 6 Percent Are Web 'Addicts' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The largest study ever of Internet users has found  
that almost 6 percent -- or more than 11 million users -- suffer from 
some form of addiction to the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, which were released Sunday at the annual meeting  
of the American Psychological Association, appear likely to bolster 
the expanding acceptance of compulsive Internet use as a real 
psychological disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marriages are being disrupted, kids are getting into trouble,  
people are committing illegal acts, people are spending too much 
money. As someone who treats patients, I see it,'' said David 
Greenfield, a therapist and researcher who conducted the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly Young, a pioneer in the new field of research, said the  
study is so broad that it ``adds a layer of legitimacy to the 
concern that Internet addiction is real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 6 percent figure is lower that some earlier  
estimates of 10 percent or more that stemmed largely from research 
on college students. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield, who is a psychologist in West Hartford, Conn.,  
carried out the study jointly with ABC News. He collected 17,251 
responses to an Internet use questionnaire distributed and returned 
through the Web site ABCNEWS.com. 
</P>
<P>
	He adapted his questions from a widely used set of criteria for  
gambling addiction. For example, the questionnaires asked if 
participants had used the Internet to escape from their problems, 
tried unsuccessfully to cut back, or found themselves preoccupied 
with the Internet when they were no longer at the computer. 
</P>
<P>
	If participants answered ``yes'' to at least five of 10 such  
criteria, they were viewed as addicted, just as in gambling. A 
total of 990 participants, or 5.7 percent, answered ``yes'' to five 
or more questions. With an estimated 200 million Internet users 
worldwide, that would mean that 11.4 million are addicts. 
</P>
<P>
	The question about using the Internet as an escape yielded more  
``yes'' answers than any other: 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield's analysis of the data suggests that Internet users'  
feelings of intimacy, timelessness and lack of inhibition all 
contribute to the addictive force of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a power here that's different than anything we've  
dealt with before,'' said Greenfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers did caution that, while one of the best estimates  
yet, the 6 percent figure is based on a group of people who use 
only one Web site, however broadly aimed. The questionnaire also 
followed ABC news coverage on Internet addiction, so relatively 
more compulsive users might been drawn to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield, though, argued that his estimate is conservative. He  
added that, just as a drug is most addictive when absorbed directly 
into the bloodstream, the Internet's potential for abuse will grow 
with modem speeds and ease of access. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said Internet addiction will ultimately be broken  
down into several categories, perhaps revolving around sex and 
relations, consumerism, gambling, stock trading, and obsessive 
Internet surfing for its own sake. 
</P>
<P>
	Therapists at the psychology meeting said they have successfully  
treated some Internet addicts, often with a mix of talking sessions 
and programs aimed more narrowly at reducing a sharply defined set 
of behaviors.

<HEADLINE> Soliah Officially Changes Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A former Symbionese Liberation Army  
fugitive awaiting trial on murder conspiracy charges legally 
changed her name Monday to the one she has been living under for 
more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A court official allowed 52-year-old Kathleen Soliah to change  
her name to Sara Jane Olson. That was the name she took when she 
settled in Minnesota after fleeing prosecution in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked during the brief hearing why she wanted to change her  
name, she said: ``Because I've used the name Sara Jane Olson in my 
private and professional life for the past 20 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Ms. Olson put two pipe bombs under Los Angeles  
police cars in 1975 in retaliation for a shootout with police that 
killed six members of the SLA, the radical group that kidnapped 
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst. Neither bomb went off. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, FBI agents acting on a tip from ``America's Most  
Wanted'' captured Ms. Olson in St. Paul, where she was living as a 
mother, a doctor's wife and a community theater actress. 
</P>
<P>
	She could get life in prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Teams Try To Keep Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- The top European soccer clubs want to  
limit the time they lose players to the national teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of six top European soccer clubs met with FIFA  
president Sepp Blatter Monday, with one of the main issues being 
their desire for ``a severe reduction in the number of friendly 
international matches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter told the so-called G-14 group of wealthy clubs that  
FIFA's ruling executive committee will ``shortly'' study a proposal 
to reduce from five to four days the period for which they will 
have to give up players for official international games. 
</P>
<P>
	AC Milan representative Adriano Galliani said the clubs ``were  
in principle not opposed to the general idea for the World Cup 
being played every two years, provided the overall calendar could 
be properly synchronized,'' FIFA said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The clubs also repeated calls for national associations to take  
over responsibility for players' salaries while on international 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Blatter backed down on his controversial plan for a  
two-yearly World Cup and said the international soccer calendar had 
to be reorganized first if the idea was to become reality. 
</P>
<P>
	He says world soccer should have a radically revised calendar by  
the year 2005 with fewer domestic matches and better coordination 
of international play. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-14 group is chaired by Lorenzo Sanz, president of Real  
Madrid. AC Milan, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Olympique Marseille and 
Porto also were represented in the meeting at FIFA headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Ben Davis Welcomed Home at Vet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Ben Davis walked into the visiting dugout at  
Veterans Stadium before his hometown debut Monday night and got 
quite a shock. 
</P>
<P>
	Plastered all over the walls were copies of a back-page  
Philadelphia newspaper photo that left his teammates rolling with 
laughter. Davis, the San Diego Padres' catcher, was pictured 
jogging on the beach with dozens of women in bikinis chasing him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't scary,'' said Davis, making his first appearance as  
a big leaguer in his hometown. ``It was a little embarrassing, but 
not scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' debut was. Admittedly nervous in front of dozens of  
friends and family, Davis was 0-for-5 in the Padres' 7-6 victory 
over the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be honest, I was a bit nervous,'' said Davis, who caused  
the biggest stir at the Vet since J.D. Drew, the draft pick who got 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they gave me a lot better treatment than they gave  
him,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been quite a ride in the majors for the 22-year-old Davis  
so far. He's hit respectably and drawn raves for his defense. He 
was squatting behind the plate for the best view of Mark McGwire's 
500th home run a couple of weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a native Chester, Pa., who attended Malvern Prep School  
in suburban Philadelphia, has become somewhat of an icon in San 
Diego -- as shown by the TV commercial on the beach that was 
depicted in Monday's Philadelphia Daily News. Padres reliever 
Trevor Hoffman was nice enough to make copies and tape them to the 
wall in the dugout before the game against the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 6-4, 220 pounds, 22 years old, cut like a weight lifter,  
looks like a movie actor,'' Tony Gwynn said. ``And he can play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, the No. 2 pick in the 1995 amateur draft, was called up  
from Triple-A Las Vegas on June 23 when Jim Leyritz went on the 
disabled list with a broken hand. In his first 32 games, Davis had 
hitting streaks of 10 and 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He's struggled lately, though, going 4-for-34 in his last nine  
games. The pressure to perform is on this week; Davis left 73 
tickets for friends and family Monday night and has 92 more waiting 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not something you get to do every day, play big league  
baseball in your own back yard,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't all been easy for Davis, despite his considerable  
skills and popularity from South Philly to the West Coast. Gwynn 
and his teammates have given Davis the customary rookie treatment, 
including razzing him for showing up on a team flight wearing a 
T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody else was wearing a jacket and shirt and a tie,''  
Gwynn said. ``The guys thought it was best to tell him, `Hey, man, 
everybody else has a shirt and tie.' They made him take his shirt 
off and sit on the plane with no shirt on. That's what rookies have 
to go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his defense, Davis admitted, ``I don't own a suit. I probably  
should start dressing like these guys do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to dispensing advice on fashion and opposing  
pitchers, Gwynn encourages Davis not to get too carried away with 
himself. After all, he doesn't even have 200 at-bats yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I met him was after I drafted him,'' Gwynn  
said. ``I told him, `Get as much as you can get, sign and start 
your baseball career.' Here we are four years later and he's a 
starting catcher in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know which way it's going to go. He can continue to  
improve and get better, or he could get caught up in himself and 
believe all the stuff he sees and reads and go the other way.''

<HEADLINE> A tale of 2 QBs: Bledsoe, Beuerlein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Carolina incumbent Steve Beuerlein is still in there, trying to  
win the quarterback job with the Panthers. Drew Bledsoe, meanwhile, 
has things well in hand with the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't taken long for Bledsoe to remind the Patriots what he  
can do with a full -- and healthy -- stable of wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Patriots' 34-14 victory over the Cowboys on Saturday  
night, a healthy Terry Glenn caught five passes for 85 yards and a 
touchdown. An injury-free Troy Brown was once again a key target 
for Bledsoe on third down. Even Vincent Brisby, who missed much of 
last season with a broken finger, added a reception late in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we have our full complement of weapons, we have a very  
dangerous offense. I expect us to score some points this year,'' 
Bledsoe said after he finished 13-of-19 for 147 yards and two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina coach George Seifert, meanwhile, appears to be  
uncomfortable talking about the quarterback competition with the 
Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after Seifert got solid performances from Beuerlein,  
Jeff Lewis and Dameyune Craig in Friday night's 20-13 victory over 
Pittsburgh, the Panthers' first-year coach wasn't interested in 
discussing their status with the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert declined to reveal whether Beuerlein would work with the  
first-team offense in the Panthers' next exhibition Friday night in 
Baltimore. And Seifert cautioned reporters against reading too much 
into his refusal to announce a starter for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't say that Beuerlein's not going to start -- please,'' he  
said. ``Right now we're just looking at all the different 
scenarios.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *Steelers    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie linebacker Joey Porter needed only two exhibition games  
to supply some pressure -- not only on opposing quarterbacks, but 
also on the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, a backup to right outside linebacker Carlos Emmons,  
continued a good training camp with two sacks Friday in the 
Steelers' 20-13 exhibition loss to Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is starting to become a little more comfortable in this  
system,'' Steelers coach Bill Cowher said. ``You can see he is an 
athlete. He can run, and you can't teach that. Once he starts 
feeling more comfortable, he is the type of guy who can make some 
plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
                               *Jets    	
</P>
<P>
	New York coach Bill Parcells terminated the contract of  
quarterback Scott Zolak on Sunday, effectively handing the team's 
backup job to newly acquired Rick Mirer. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came two days after the club obtained Mirer from the  
Packers for a conditional selection in next year's draft. Zolak, a 
nine-year veteran in his first year with the Jets, played poorly in 
Friday night's 10-9 preseason win over the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a better opportunity for him to let him go now,''  
Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Bengals    	
</P>
<P>
	Safety Kelvin Moore was in stable condition at a hospital in  
Pontiac, Mich., two days after he broke a vertebra in his neck 
while making a tackle in an exhibition game against the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore has feeling in his arms and legs and is expected to make  
``an excellent recovery,'' team Dr. Robert Heidt Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching film of the play, coach Bruce Coslet said Moore  
did everything right and still got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like he was a little bit stumbling into him and just  
bent his head back,'' Coslet said. ``It just happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals, meanwhile, waived wide receiver Tommy Boyd and

	The hamstring injury that cornerback Jason Sehorn suffered a  
week before training camp continues to heal slowly and he will miss 
another week or two, according to coach Jim Fassel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn had an MRI on Friday and doctors decided not to let him  
run this week, Fassel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although he is just striding and things, they just want to  
make sure he completely rests it,'' Fassel said. ``So we are going

yards on 10 carries and scored on runs of 16 and 12 yards as the 
Colts beat New Orleans 37-7 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Edgerrin really showed why we picked him so high,'' Colts  
coach Jim Mora said. ``He gave us a spark and showed what he can 
do. He looks like the real deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts took James as the fourth overall draft pick, one spot  
ahead of the Saints, who took Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Quake Victims Return to Ga. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A 76-year-old woman and her daughter-in-law, both  
injured in the devasating earthquake in Turkey, arrived home in 
Georgia today on a jet specially equipped with medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of five family members, the only Americans confirmed  
dead in last week's quake, also were returned home. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkan Kilic, 76, was in critical condition in the intensive  
care unit at Kennestone Hospital with injuries to her lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she's at that point where she's very, very critical.  
She might make it, she might not,'' said Dr. Cengiz Kilic, one of 
Mrs. Kilic's four children who traveled to Turkey to bring back 
their injured and deceased family members. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Kilic, Mrs. Kilic's daughter-in-law, was hospitalized in  
stable condition, recovering from nerve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The women returned to Georgia early this morning on a special  
jet equipped with a ventilator and other medical equipment, Kilic 
said. Other family members returned on a flight from Istanbul late 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkan Kilic's husband, Nizam, and four of Jan Kilic's children  
-- Jeffrey, 6, Jennifer, 5, David, 2, and Katie, 9 months -- were 
killed in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	A 3-year-old daughter, Natalie, survived with just a black eye.  
</P>
<P>
	The Kilic children and their paternal grandfather are believed  
to be the only Americans confirmed dead in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	Nizam and Turkan Kilic, retired doctors, moved from Turkey to  
the United States more than 40 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Industry Survives Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IZMIT, Turkey (AP) -- The car-repair shop where Cihan Cakiroglu  
worked is twisted wreckage, his boss is dead, and the August 
paycheck thatis now homeless family needs will never come. 
</P>
<P>
	At the nearby Goodyear tire plant, the blue steel walls still  
stand, but most of the employees are too busy searching for 
relatives or shelter for their families to show up for work. 
</P>
<P>
	Turks nationwide are struggling to recover from the massive,  
7.4-magnitude earthquake that struck the country's industrial 
heartland early Tuesday. The social and economic costs appear to be 
staggering. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of homeless people like Cakiroglu are demanding that  
the government help them buy new homes and furniture and find them 
new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say each day remaining factories like the Goodyear plant  
remain idle leads to a loss of $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, already struggling to cut back a federal budget  
deficit, is strapped for the cash needed to repair basic 
infrastructure, including roads, bridges and electrical lines. And 
the area hit provides almost half the tax revenue, meaning the 
government will have even less income to count on. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost to the economy could top $20 billion -- 10 percent of  
the country's gross national product and enough to drag the country 
back into recession, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Government spokesman Sukru Sina Gurel said the economic damage  
to the country could ``be beyond what any tragic event in the 
history of Turkey has caused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulent Akgerman, head of the Aegean Young Businessmen  
Association, has suggested a six-day work week to overcome the 
impact of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Other industrialists are demanding aid from the international  
community, which has already provided $500 million in loans and 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we will be able to deal with it smoothly if we  
receive support from international organizations,'' said Tevfik 
Aksoy, chief economist of Istanbul's Bank Ekspres. ``I seriously 
doubt that Turkey will be left alone on this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also pointed out that the crucial cement, automobile and tire  
factories that make western Turkey so important to the economy have 
been left largely undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
	They are expected to reopen soon, which will no doubt help ease  
the strain of the earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Goodyear plant in Izmit, for example, was built with steel  
walls and survived the earthquake, unlike many local homes and 
buildings made of cheap cement, said engineering manager Mehmet 
Turkel. 
</P>
<P>
	Some equipment was damaged, he said, but the plant should be  
able to reopen quickly, and its 500 employees should return to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you come here in a week, you'll see this plant running,''  
he said. ``People want it to happen.'' But the plant will wait a 
few days more for the search for survivors and possessions to end. 
Five of the plant's workers are believed to have been killed in the 
quake, and almost half have lost their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Personnel manager Harun Savas said the plant is offering tea and  
sandwiches to workers who come in to help assess damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to start a new life,'' said Savas, who pulled the  
bodies of five of his relatives from the wreckage of their homes 
and later helped bury them. 
</P>
<P>
	His house survived the earthquake, but his 12-year-old son,  
Cagdas, was too frightened to stay in Izmit and has gone with 
Savas' wife and daughter to live with relatives on the Black Sea 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the major problem will be how to get people back to  
work,'' said Haluk Tukel, the secretary-general of TUSIAD, the 
country's leading organization of industrialists. 
</P>
<P>
	But for many people, there is no longer any work to speak of.  
</P>
<P>
	In a grassy lot in front of a 50-foot pile of rubble, Cakiroglu  
stood beside his new home -- a brown blanket held up by a few sticks 
of wood. It is here that he sleeps with his wife and 3-year-old 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm willing to do anything, even sell pretzels on the  
street,'' Cakiroglu said.

<HEADLINE> Tarasov Criticizes Russian Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Maxim Tarasov, the second-best pole  
vaulter in history and a favorite at the World Championships, is 
lamenting the current state of Russian sports. 
</P>
<P>
	He says it's understandable that some promising athletes are  
leaving his country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things in sports are getting worse and worse in Russia. That  
is my feeling,'' Tarasov said Monday, on the eve of pole vault 
qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarasov has been living in Budapest for most of the past seven  
years, and does not rule out seeking Hungarian citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, I could well become, let's say, Hungarian,'' he said,  
but stressed he has no such plans at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarasov, 28, said he would hang on to his nationality ``unless  
there is something really terrible in Russia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sports infrastructure has gone dramatically downhill from the  
Soviet days, a prime victim of the country's troubled economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my home city there are simply no facilities for pole  
vaulting, so when I became a national-level vaulter I had to spend 
half a year away, where there is a pit and a runway,'' he said. 
``And now it has become even worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What also worries Tarasov is a growing disinterest in sports.  
</P>
<P>
	``The media, they don't care about sport,'' he said. ``When I  
jump 6.05 meters (19.85 feet), which was quite a big national 
record, they didn't mention it on television. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one athlete -- Ukraine's Sergei Bubka -- who holds the world  
mark of 20.14 feet, has gone higher than Tarasov. 
</P>
<P>
	``They only care about politics, the president, and how bad the  
economy is, nothing else,'' Tarasov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarasov is not the first top Russian pole vaulter to leave the  
country. Viktor Chistiakov, a promising vaulter who is now 24, went 
to Australia in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like probably he has done the right thing to become an  
Australian,'' Tarasov said.

<HEADLINE> Rules Tightened for Fund Managers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have tightened the rules  
governing personal trading by mutual fund managers and employees, 
in the wake of several cases of fund managers accused of improperly 
enriching themselves with investors' money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday announced the  
move, which it has been considering for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes adopted by the SEC give boards of directors of  
mutual fund companies more supervision over personal trading by 
managers and employees and require fuller disclosure of such 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes are designed to avoid conflicts of interest that can  
arise when mutual fund managers and employees buy and sell 
securities for their own accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``These amendments will help ensure that the personal trading of  
mutual fund insiders does not compromise the interests of mutual 
fund shareholders,'' Paul Roye, director of the SEC's Division of 
Investment Management, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	If the regulators find that abuses persist, Roye warned, they  
will take ``enforcement action where necessary to protect 
investors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say personal trading by managers can hurt average mutual  
fund investors by, for example, driving up the price of stocks that 
are owned by managers and also must be purchased by the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	As previously reported by The Associated Press, a former  
in-house watchdog of the nation's fifth-largest mutual fund company 
asked the SEC and the FBI to investigate his claims that some of 
its money managers abused their positions for profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The requests to the federal agencies from Edward Siedle, a  
former SEC attorney and legal counsel for Putnam Investments, 
followed reports of a probe by federal and New York state 
authorities into the personal trading of a former money manager for 
another big fund company, Dreyfus Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Putnam denied the allegations. The company acknowledged,  
however, that it did restrict the trading of one fund manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreyfus, which is owned by Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank Corp.,  
said it believed that the fund manager -- whom it placed on paid 
leave -- followed its rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Siedle criticized the rule changes Monday, saying the SEC did  
not go far enough because it failed to require mutual fund 
companies to publicly disclose violations by employees of their 
personal trading codes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The SEC has once again not required disclosure to the public  
of illegal trading activity,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt has been pushing to expand the power  
of independent directors of mutual fund companies in an effort to 
better protect the millions of Americans who invest in the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 77 million Americans now invest in mutual funds, whose  
total assets exceeded $5.5 trillion at the end of last year, up 
from around $1 trillion in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes announced Monday, which take effect Oct. 29,  
include: 
</P>
<P>
	--A fund company's board of directors must approve the code of  
ethics that govern the fund and its managers and must review 
reports of any problems. 
</P>
<P>
	--Fund managers and other employees who participate in investment  
decisions must provide a report of their securities holdings to 
their employers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Fund managers and other top employees must get advance approval  
for any investments in initial public offerings or private 
placements of securities. 
</P>
<P>
	--Fund companies must disclose to the SEC their policies  
regarding personal trading practices by employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Fink, president of the Investment Company Institute, the  
mutual fund industry's trade group, said the group welcomed the 
changes, which it said ``further strengthen the existing strict 
regulation of personal investing by mutual fund personnel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ICI and the mutual fund industry ``have long supported effective  
restrictions on personal investing as part of their commitment to 
maintaining high ethical standards,'' Fink said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade group says an ``overwhelming majority'' of fund  
companies have voluntarily adopted codes of conduct for personal 
trading.

<HEADLINE> Iomega Chooses Interim CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROY, Utah (AP) -- Iomega chairman David J. Dunn will serve as the  
company's interim CEO while it searches -- again-- for a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn, who replaces Jodie Glore, said he plans to return the  
company to ``profitable growth, continuing Iomega's development of 
innovative solutions and recruiting top talent to fill executive 
openings, including that of CEO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He takes over effective Sept. 1, until a new CEO is hired.  
</P>
<P>
	Iomega, the maker of the Jaz and Zip removable data-storage  
systems for personal computers, announced the decision Monday after 
a unanimous vote of its board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Glore, who resigned Thursday, said he wanted to spend more time  
with his family and was not leaving for another job. He was the 
second CEO in 10 months to leave Iomega. 
</P>
<P>
	Glore had replaced interim president and CEO James E. Sierk, who  
remained on Iomega's board of directors. Sierk was named to the 
post in March 1998, when president and CEO Kim Edwards abruptly 
resigned after the company announced it had lost $25 million in 
that year's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Iomega has continued to struggle in the marketplace  
and has lost several key employees.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Viking Ditches Assault Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MASON, Mich. (AP) -- Leroy McFadden, a rookie tailback cut Monday  
by the Minnesota Vikings, on Monday risked being sought on a bench 
warrant after failing to appear for his trial on a misdemeanor 
assault count. 
</P>
<P>
	McFadden, out of Michigan State, faces up to 90 days in jail on  
a charge accusing him of assaulting the mother of his 9-month-old 
child at her Lansing home May 16. 
</P>
<P>
	He rushed six times for 24 yards in the Vikings' preseason  
victory over the Cleveland Browns on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last week, McFadden's attorney Stuart Shafer asked that his  
client's trial Monday be delayed, given that both men would be out 
of Michigan and that he believed the alleged victim wanted the case 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ingham County Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III said Monday he  
declined to back Shafer's request. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've dealt with Mr. McFadden before in a non-criminal manner,  
and he also appeared to have difficulty appearing for those 
proceedings,'' Dunnings said without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I also guess I wasn't inclined to give him an adjournment,  
particularly when it was requested at the last minute. Most people 
we ask to come to court have jobs, and sometimes you just have to 
take off and come, especially if you're the defendant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When McFadden and Shafer failed to appear Monday, prosecutors  
were granted a judge's bench warrant seeking McFadden's arrest, 
Dunnings said. The judge agreed to delay enforcement of the warrant 
to give Shafer unspecified time to explain his client's absence 
Monday, Dunnings said. 
</P>
<P>
	When reached later Monday by telephone while returning to  
Michigan from Illinois, Shafer said he was unaware of Monday's 
developments but said he was ``not concerned at all'' about the 
possible bench warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I'll talk to the judge tomorrow and explain what I  
just explained to you'' about reasons for Monday's court absence, 
Shafer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunnings said his office would decide whether to halt  
prosecution, not the alleged victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say McFadden assaulted his child's mother in May,  
the same month Michigan State announced the then-senior tailback 
was academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
	McFadden played in nine games last season for the Spartans,  
gaining 69 yards on 23 carries.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Lineman Has Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona Cardinals offensive lineman  
Ernest Dye underwent seven hours of surgery to repair nerves in his 
right arm, which was crushed in a car crash on Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors on Sunday removed strands of nerves from Dye's lower  
legs and grafted them onto his median and ulnar nerves, which 
provide movement for his hand and forearm. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye, whose arm was nearly severed in the accident, already had  
undergone a nine-hour surgery immediately after the crash to repair 
a bone in his arm and restore blood flow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We currently are monitoring his arm for possible infection and  
repairs we have made,'' Dr. Stephen Lex said in a statement 
released Monday by the Cardinals. ``In a couple of weeks, Mr. Dye 
should be able to begin physical therapy to keep his joints limber 
while we wait for the nerves to regenerate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although no one has said so officially, the injury almost  
certainly ended the playing career of the former University of 
South Carolina player. 
</P>
<P>
	Lex said nerves grow so slowly that it could be as long as three  
years before doctors know the extent of Dye's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye was among three players traveling to Flagstaff for the  
resumption of Cardinals' training camp when his car veered off 
Interstate 17 during a rainstorm and overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye and linebacker Carl Simpson were thrown from the car, and  
Dye's arm was pinned beneath the vehicle. Offensive guard Lester 
Holmes, who was driving, was the only one wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson injured his hip and is back with the team, but is not  
practicing. Holmes severely cut his forehead and has yet to rejoin 
the team. He is recuperating at his Phoenix home. Police have said 
Holmes would be cited for driving faster than was prudent at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	The car was traveling at about the posted speed limit of 75 mph  
but should have been going slower considering the weather, police 
said.

<HEADLINE> Defense Rests in Talk Show Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A day after learning on a segment taped  
for ``The Jenny Jones Show'' that his secret admirer was a gay 
acquaintance, Jonathan Schmitz showed signs that he was unsettled, 
his former boss testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally prompt and a model employee, Schmitz showed up late at  
the suburban Detroit restaurant where he worked as a waiter, poorly 
dressed and smelling of alcohol, said restaurant owner Kevin 
Downey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed he had been up most of the night,'' Downey testified  
Monday. ``He was not the same Jonathan Schmitz I knew before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz is accused of second-degree murder in the shotgun  
slaying of Scott Amedure three days after the taping in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Downey was among four witnesses called Monday on Schmitz's  
behalf before the defense rested, setting the stage for closing 
arguments Wednesday in his retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, then 24, and Amedure, 32, flew to Chicago for the  
taping on March 6, 1995. Amedure, who was gay, revealed his crush 
on Schmitz to the studio audience during the segment, which never 
aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz's father, Allyn Schmitz, said his son worried that  
viewers of the episode might wrongly believe he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
	``That thing in Chicago didn't work out too good for me,'' the  
elder Schmitz quoted his son as saying after returning from the 
taping. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Schmitz did not testify. He was convicted of  
second-degree murder in the original trial, but an appeals court 
overturned the verdict because of faulty jury instructions given by 
the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Schmitz calmly went about his business three  
days after the taping, buying ammunition and a shotgun, then 
shooting a defenseless Amedure twice in his mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense has argued that Amedure's affection turned into an  
obsession and that he provoked Schmitz. Schmitz's lawyer, Jerome 
Sabbota, said during opening statements that a conviction on the 
lesser offense of manslaughter would be the just outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate civil case, a jury in May found the show and its  
corporate owner, Warner Bros., negligent and ordered them to pay 
$25 million in damages to Amedure's relatives. Warner Bros. is 
appealing that decision.

<HEADLINE> Maddux Has Chipped Bone in Wrist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The injuries just keep on coming for the Atlanta  
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	The team learned Sunday that four-time Cy Young Award winner  
Greg Maddux chipped a bone in his pitching wrist a day earlier when 
he tumbled to the ground trying to catch a foul ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the ominous sound of the injury, the Braves don't  
believe it's serious. Still, Maddux could miss his next start 
Friday night against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sore,'' he said. ``We'll have to wait a couple of days  
and see how it feels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was the latest in a string of misfortune to plague  
the Braves, who are attempting to extend their record streak of 
seven straight postseason appearances. Atlanta moved a half-game 
ahead of the New York Mets in the NL East with a 3-2 victory over 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	During spring training, the Braves lost leading hitter Andres  
Galarraga (cancer) and closer Kerry Ligtenberg (elbow) for the 
whole season. Then, catcher Javy Lopez (knee) and pitcher Odalis 
Perez (elbow) sustained season-ending injuries. Also, starter John 
Smoltz has been hampered by a sore elbow all season, prompting him 
to alter his delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't go around whining and crying about it,'' Kevin  
Millwood said. ``There's still a good chance we're going to the 
playoffs, and we could go a long way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager John Schuerholz described Maddux's injury as a  
``small chip of a small bone in his wrist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the doctors had to go back and look at the X-rays  
a couple of times just to see it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux (16-6) is tied for the NL lead in wins, despite allowing  
a major league-worst 213 hits and having an ERA of 3.61 -- the 
highest since his rookie season with the Chicago Cubs in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander could skip his next start without seriously  
hampering the Braves pitching plans. Since the team is off 
Thursday, fifth starter Terry Mulholland could come back against 
the Cardinals on regular four days rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland, acquired at the trading deadline from the Cubs,  
worked eight innings Sunday in the victory over the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``It works out good,'' Maddux said. ``My day to pitch is an off  
day, so the other four guys don't have to worry if something 
happens. There's no real urgency. We'll just wait a couple of days 
and see how it feels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, the injury occurred on a botched defensive play by  
a pitcher who has won nine straight Gold Glove awards. 
</P>
<P>
	On a low foul pop-up in the sixth inning, Maddux called off  
third baseman Chipper Jones but lost control of the ball trying to 
make the catch. Maddux dove near the Padres dugout in a second, 
unsuccessful attempt to grab the ball before it hit the ground, 
only to land on his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux remained in the game, retiring the side in order in the  
seventh before the bullpen took over to close out a 6-2 victory. He 
allowed eight hits and both San Diego runs while striking out nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux has never been on the disabled list in his 13-year  
career.

<HEADLINE> Private Group Bids for Eskimo Pie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A private investment group has joined the  
bidding for Eskimo Pie Corp., offering $10.125 a share for the 
Richmond-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid, valued at $35 million, comes as Eskimo Pie's largest  
shareholder is attempting to replace the company's board of 
directors with one willing to sell the company off in pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	Yogen Fruz World-Wide Inc., which owns a 17 percent stake in  
Eskimo Pie and has made several previous attempts to acquire the 
company, initiated a proxy battle last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Eskimo Pie, which declined to identify the group that made  
Friday's bid, also markets frozen products under the SnackWell's 
and OREO brand names. It staved off previous offers from Yogen 
Fruz, first in November at $10.25 a share and then in December at 
$13. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Friday's bid) is at the bottom end of what Yogen Fruz thought  
the company was worth,'' said Kenneth Gassman, an analyst at 
Davenport &AMP; Co. in Richmond. ``In my opinion, you'll see another 
bid -- a higher bid -- and probably from Yogen Fruz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eskimo Pie said in a news release that its second largest  
shareholder, Peak Management Inc., which owns about 10.7 percent of 
the company's outstanding common stock, supports the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yogen Fruz president and co-chief executive officer Michael  
Serruya said Monday his company would not support the bid from the 
undisclosed group. 
</P>
<P>
	``This proposal clearly would be a better deal for Eskimo's  
current management than for the shareholders,'' Serruya said. 
``They would hold onto their jobs, while shareholders would take a 
one-third discount off the full value of their shares.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eskimo Pie's current board could be vulnerable in the proxy  
battle, Gassman said. Board members own only 4 percent of the 
company. Yogen-Fruz would require the support of 51 percent of 
shareholders to replace the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto-based Yogen Fruz operates about 3,500 frozen-yogurt  
outlets and has recently entered the retail dessert market. It also 
operates other well-known brands such as Yoohoo, Yoplait, and Trix. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman from Eskimo Pie declined further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Gassman said Yogen Fruz is primarily interested in Eskimo Pie's  
brand names. He said Eskimo Pie was created by Reynolds Metals as a 
market for aluminum foil and therefore has few other assets of 
value. 
</P>
<P>
	Yogen Fruz has said it is acting to raise stock value for all  
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eskimo Pie cannot be sold 'as a whole' to any single buyer for  
the highest price because Eskimo Pie is a hodge-podge collection of 
small dissimilar parts,'' Yogen Fruz said in its proxy statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Eskimo Pie rose 6 1/4 cents to $10.06 1/4 in trading on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> New Boeing Jet To Debut This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVERETT, Wash. (AP) -- Boeing's first new jetliner to enter  
service in the 21st century will be officially unveiled on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 767-400ER is 21 feet longer and can carry about 15 percent  
more passengers than the 767-300ER, which is itself a stretched 
version of the original 767-200 that entered service in 1982. ER 
stands for ``extended range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine aircraft is being pitched as a replacement for  
the L-1011, the widebody jetliner that earned praise for design, 
but struggled for market share and marked the end of Lockheed's 
commercial airplane efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The new plane also is intended to replace aging DC-10s, the  
McDonnell Douglas trijet that went into development at the same 
time as the L-1011 and looks nearly identical. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the 767-400ER gives Boeing a strategic advantage  
over European rival Airbus Industrie in the market for mid-sized 
commercial aircraft -- planes with a capacity for 200 to 250 
passengers and a range of 5,000 to 7,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The new plane will seat 245 passengers in the typical  
three-class configuration, or 304 passengers in two classes. Its 
range is about 6,480 miles. The list price ranges from $105 million 
to $117 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (middle) market isn't all that big right now, but Boeing  
is taking the part of it that matters,'' Richard Aboulafia, chief 
aviation analyst with the Teal Group, told the Seattle 
Post-Intelligencer. ``The development costs of the 767-400 were not 
that high and Boeing will probably sell several hundred 
airplanes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Boeing has firm orders for 54 of the new planes,  
including 26 from Continental and 21 from Delta Airlines, which has 
options to buy 24 more. Boeing projects that over the next 20 
years, there will be demand for 2,000 new mid-sized jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus has sold 113 of its competing A330-200 to 20 customers  
since the aircraft was first delivered in May 1998, said David 
Venz, a spokesman for Airbus in the United States. Of those, 36 
have been delivered. 
</P>
<P>
	A new feature of the 767-400ER is the ``raked,'' or swept back  
wing tip, which provides better aerodynamics and translates into 
fuel savings on longer flights.

<HEADLINE> Study: 6 Percent Are Web 'Addicts' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The largest study ever of Internet users has found  
that almost 6 percent -- or more than 11 million users -- suffer from 
some form of addiction to the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, which were released Sunday at the annual meeting  
of the American Psychological Association, appear likely to bolster 
the expanding acceptance of compulsive Internet use as a real 
psychological disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marriages are being disrupted, kids are getting into trouble,  
people are committing illegal acts, people are spending too much 
money. As someone who treats patients, I see it,'' said David 
Greenfield, a therapist and researcher who conducted the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly Young, a pioneer in the new field of research, said the  
study is so broad that it ``adds a layer of legitimacy to the 
concern that Internet addiction is real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 6 percent figure is lower that some earlier  
estimates of 10 percent or more that stemmed largely from research 
on college students. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield, who is a psychologist in West Hartford, Conn.,  
carried out the study jointly with ABC News. He collected 17,251 
responses to an Internet use questionnaire distributed and returned 
through the Web site ABCNEWS.com. 
</P>
<P>
	He adapted his questions from a widely used set of criteria for  
gambling addiction. For example, the questionnaires asked if 
participants had used the Internet to escape from their problems, 
tried unsuccessfully to cut back, or found themselves preoccupied 
with the Internet when they were no longer at the computer. 
</P>
<P>
	If participants answered ``yes'' to at least five of 10 such  
criteria, they were viewed as addicted, just as in gambling. A 
total of 990 participants, or 5.7 percent, answered ``yes'' to five 
or more questions. With an estimated 200 million Internet users 
worldwide, that would mean that 11.4 million are addicts. 
</P>
<P>
	The question about using the Internet as an escape yielded more  
``yes'' answers than any other: 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield's analysis of the data suggests that Internet users'  
feelings of intimacy, timelessness and lack of inhibition all 
contribute to the addictive force of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a power here that's different than anything we've  
dealt with before,'' said Greenfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers did caution that, while one of the best estimates  
yet, the 6 percent figure is based on a group of people who use 
only one Web site, however broadly aimed. The questionnaire also 
followed ABC news coverage on Internet addiction, so relatively 
more compulsive users might been drawn to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield, though, argued that his estimate is conservative. He  
added that, just as a drug is most addictive when absorbed directly 
into the bloodstream, the Internet's potential for abuse will grow 
with modem speeds and ease of access. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said Internet addiction will ultimately be broken  
down into several categories, perhaps revolving around sex and 
relations, consumerism, gambling, stock trading, and obsessive 
Internet surfing for its own sake. 
</P>
<P>
	Therapists at the psychology meeting said they have successfully  
treated some Internet addicts, often with a mix of talking sessions 
and programs aimed more narrowly at reducing a sharply defined set 
of behaviors.

<HEADLINE> Marino Testifies in Martin Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Dan Marino's testimony notwithstanding, Miami  
Dolphins receiver Tony Martin could not have turned a blind eye to 
huge cash repayments from a longtime friend, prosecutors said 
Monday at Martin's money-laundering trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony Martin can't stick his head in the sand,'' Assistant U.S.  
Attorney Ron DeWaard said in closing arguments. ``When he entered 
into those kinds of shady transactions, he had to know it was 
illegal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is accused of leasing three cars in his name on behalf of  
Rickey Brownlee, who paid him back with cash. He also is accused of 
taking $100,000 in cash to reimburse a check written to Brownlee's 
first lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether Martin, who has known Brownlee since  
childhood and calls him his uncle, knowingly accepted drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys contend that Brownlee's money was made from  
the restaurant business, not drugs, and any cash given to Martin 
was legally acquired. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-week case began winding down Monday, with jurors  
hearing closing statements from DeWaard and Brownlee's attorneys. 
Martin's lawyers will make their closing argument Tuesday morning, 
with jury deliberations to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's attorneys needed less than 30 minutes to present his  
case on Monday, calling just three character witnesses to the 
stand. Two of those were Marino and former Dolphins receiver Nat 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Some jurors smiled and nudged one another as Marino strode  
through the courtroom to take the stand. The NFL's leading career 
passer said he has known Martin since the receiver first joined the 
Dolphins in 1989, and Martin has visited Marino's home and met his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony's always been a good person,'' Marino said during his  
five-minute testimony. ``He's a loyal teammate. I don't believe 
Tony to be someone that would willingly commit a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by DeWaard whether he had any testimony relating to the  
money-laundering charges, Marino said: ``Other than what I know 
about Tony as a person, no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was the extent of cross-examination, though DeWaard drew a  
few chuckles when he told Marino, ``Good luck this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino said nothing as he left the courthouse accompanied by  
O.J. McDuffie, another Dolphins receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	DeWaard was less benevolent during his closing statement,  
telling jurors that Martin freely chose ``to become a money 
launderer for a drug trafficker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you do a transaction with a drug dealer, you can't say,  
`I don't care. I'm not going to look at where that money is coming 
from,''' DeWaard said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeWaard noted evidence that Martin never handled a large amount  
of cash until Brownlee, who served seven years in prison in two 
1980s drug cases, was freed in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months after the release, he said, Martin wrote checks for  
more than $13,000 to lease a 1994 Acura Legend. A few days later, 
the receiver made a $12,900 cash deposit into his bank account. 
Similar deposits came quickly after Martin leased two other cars 
used by Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
	All the while, DeWaard said, Brownlee was piling up $1.3 million  
in unexplained wealth. He also cited video and audiotapes of 
undercover drug transactions linked to Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no explanation how he made that money,'' DeWaard said.  
``He obviously made it through drug trafficking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brownlee's lawyers countered by saying prosecutors conveniently  
disregarded $1.6 million in revenue generated over 2 1/2 years at two 
restaurants Brownlee operated. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Peter Raben showed jurors two ledgers listing daily  
income at the restaurants. The establishments were registered in an 
associate's name, but several former workers testified that 
Brownlee ran the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government said Rickey Brownlee has unexplained wealth. I  
think we've learned by now that he has $1.6 million of explained 
wealth,'' Raben said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mel Black, Brownlee's other lawyer, noted that prosecutors could  
not find Brownlee's fingerprints on drug buys made by undercover 
agents, and that no marked money was found in Brownlee's 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't prove this was drug money because you can't prove  
Rickey Brownlee was drug dealing,'' Black said.

<HEADLINE> Britons Ship Beef to Brussels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British beef exporters shipped a small package of  
steaks to Brussels on Monday in a symbolic gesture aimed at 
re-establishing the $832 million export market. 
</P>
<P>
	The 110-pound consignment was the first British beef exported  
since the European Union lifted its 29-month ban three weeks ago, 
after ruling out a further threat of mad cow disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The shipment, from the St. Merryn Meat abattoir in Cornwall, was  
organized by Britain's Meat and Livestock Commission. It will be 
served Wednesday at a luncheon banquet attended by EU 
commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Minister Nick Brown admitted British farmers face a  
tough struggle to regain market share. ``It is going to be a long 
struggle to recapture markets which were good markets when the 
shutters came down in 1996,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain is expected to export 5,500 tons of de-boned beef this  
year, a fraction of the 271,100 tons shipped in 1995, the last full 
export year. 
</P>
<P>
	The beef ban was imposed after scientists identified a link  
between bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, and a 
new type of the human Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. 
</P>
<P>
	It was lifted Aug. 1, after EU agriculture ministers agreed that  
Britain had implemented strict regulations to avoid a recurrence of 
the disease.

	MOORESVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Ernie Irvan was released from a  
hospital Monday and returned to his farm in North Carolina to 
continue his recovery from injuries in a crash last week at 
Michigan Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan, who suffered a bruised lung and a mild head injury in  
Friday's crash, was released Monday from St. Joseph Mercy Hospital 
in Ypsilanti, Mich. He was flown to his home in this north

</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Mooresville-based MB2 Motorsports team said  
they were still considering whether Irvan was fit enough to drive 
in this week's Winston Cup event at Bristol Motor Speedway. Irvan, 
40, who was knocked unconscious in the Michigan wreck, was replaced 
for that event by Dick Trickle. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan's crash, which occurred during a practice run in his Busch  
Grand National car, came five years to the day after he had a 
near-fatal wreck in a Winston Cup car on the same two-mile track in 
Brooklyn, Mich.

<HEADLINE> Thompson-Thorpe-Heyns Break Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Jenny Thompson rode a ``calm, peaceful  
feeling'' to break Mary T. Meagher's 18-year-old 100-meter 
butterfly record during a record rush at the Pan Pacific swim 
championships today. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 26, was visibly shaken after eclipsing the  
second-oldest record in swimming, set by Meagher on Aug. 16, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	But before the race, Thompson said she underwent a  
transformation which helped her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't even believe it,'' Thompson said. ``I didn't feel  
that great yesterday, this morning or even in the warmup tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then, when I was coming out for the race, I felt that calm,  
peaceful feeling and I knew things were going to be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's Ian Thorpe broke his second world record of the  
meet, in the 200 freestyle, while South Africa's Penny Heyns got 
her fifth world record in five races in the 100 breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, a five-time Olympic gold medalist, had a time of 57.88  
seconds to lower the mark of 57.93 set by Meagher and break the 
fourth world record in two days at the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson has never won an individual gold at an Olympics but is  
favored to take the event in the same pool next year.	   ''The record used to seem like a long shot,'' said Thompson. 
``My time's been dropping little by little and it's seemed more 
like a reality each time. Tonight I didn't know where I was in the 
race but I just kept going and hoped it was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was followed home by Australia's Susie O'Neill who will  
attack the oldest record, Meagher's 200 fly mark set three days 
before the 100 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was awesome, I feel so good for Jenny,'' O'Neill said.  
``She's done it, now I want to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-year-old Thorpe added the 200 record to the 400 he set on  
Sunday. His time of 1 minute, 46.34 seconds came in a semifinal 
heat that included previous record holder Grant Hackett, who went 
1:46.67 earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hackett missed the final and said he might pull out of his  
favored 1,500 event, Thorpe promised he was still not at his peak 
in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still haven't recovered as much as I'd have liked to from  
the 400,'' said Thorpe. ``I'm still a bit worse for wear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heyns broke her fifth record in five races with victory in the  
heat. Her time of 1:06.52 broke her own record of 1:06.95 set at 
the Janet Evans Invitational in Los Angeles on July 19. 
</P>
<P>
	At that meet the Olympic champion broke the 100 and 200 records  
twice each. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you know me you'll know that I quite often run hot in the  
morning, so it wasn't a big surprise,'' Heyns said. ``I never 
really go for a world record, I just go out for a personal best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooke Bennett, the world championship silver medalist, won the  
women's 400 freestyle from fellow American Lindsay Benko. Costa 
Rica's Claudia Poll was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's Matthew Dunn won a thrilling 400 medley final  
against Canada's Curtis Myden, the man who stripped Dunn of the 
Commonwealth record two weeks ago. Dunn charged back from third at 
the final turn to get ahead five meters from the finish. American 
Tom Wilkens, who led with 100 to race, was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's Simon Cowley won the men's 100 breastroke in  
1:02.06, ahead of compatriot Regan Harrison with Canada's Morgan 
Knabe third. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia led the gold standings with four from eight events  
with the U.S. on three and Canada at one.

<HEADLINE> Talks With Alcoholics Cut Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A brief talk with hospitalized injury patients  
about their drinking problems dramatically reduced their risk of 
getting injured again, a study has found. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-minute conversation with a psychologist cut the risk  
nearly in half, prompting one trauma surgeon to call the study 
``ground-breaking'' evidence that such brief interventions can make 
a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	The work was done in a trauma center, which provides specialized  
care for life-threatening injuries like those from crashes or 
violence. But a similar program might also work in hospital 
emergency rooms, said Dr. Larry Gentilello. 
</P>
<P>
	Gentilello, a trauma surgeon at the Harborview Medical Center of  
the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, 
presented the results Sunday at the annual meeting of the American 
Psychological Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ground-breaking work,'' declared another trauma surgeon,  
Dr. Carl A. Soderstrom of the University of Maryland's trauma 
center in Baltimore. It's the first evidence that such a brief 
intervention can help with alcohol problems in that setting, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will get the attention of the rule-makers in emergency  
departments and trauma centers,'' said Soderstrom, who's planning 
another study of the approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, trauma centers generally don't address the problem of  
alcohol abuse in their patients, even though it's a potent factor 
in causing injuries, Gentilello said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the brief intervention didn't help severely dependent  
alcoholics, it did show an effect in people with mild to moderate 
alcohol problems, he said. Such people are involved in most 
alcohol-related crashes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His study screened 2,574 trauma center patients for drinking  
problems by measuring blood alcohol levels, testing for evidence of 
impaired liver function and administering a 15-item questionnaire. 
The questionnaire asked about such things as whether the person had 
tried to cut down on drinking or drank in the morning, or whether 
his or her family was upset about the drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-six percent of the patients showed evidence of a drinking  
problem, and 762 of them were randomly assigned to get either the 
brief intervention or just normal care. Some assigned to the 
intervention were discharged before it could be done, so eventually 
304 patients got it and 396 were assigned to the no-intervention 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	For the intervention, a psychologist first described the results  
of the screening tests and asked the patient's reaction to the fact 
that his or her blood alcohol level, for example, would boost the 
risk of a crash some 300-fold. 
</P>
<P>
	The psychologist then made clear it was the patient's  
responsibility to do something about the drinking problem, if the 
patient chose to, and provided encouragement that the problem could 
be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	After listing options for treatment, but without forcing the  
patient to choose, the psychologist offered empathy and further 
encouragement that the problem could be dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, the patient got a letter summarizing the  
conversation, offering further encouragement and a phone number to 
clear up any questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers used hospital records to show that people in the  
intervention group were far less likely to show up again for 
treatment of injuries than the patients who hadn't gotten the 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a 48 percent difference for either inpatient or  
outpatient treatment at Harborview within one year. For inpatient 
treatment anywhere in the state, the difference was 47 percent for 
periods of up to three years.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plays Sax at Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- There just happened to be a spare  
saxophone on the bandstand, so the president grabbed it and plunged 
into a jazzy rendition of ``My Funny Valentine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scene, with a relaxed Bill Clinton providing the solo for a  
couple celebrating their wedding anniversary at a political 
fund-raiser for his wife, Hillary, would have been unthinkable at 
presidential vacation time a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the president avoided his favorite vacation activity:  
golf. But today, Clinton donned a blue shirt and khaki shorts, then 
headed for Farm Neck Golf Club with a foursome that included Sen. 
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., Boston businessman Thomas Lee and New 
York investment banker Matt Gohd. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spent about 10 minutes at the driving range, then took  
his first tee shot. ``Aw, I killed it. I came over. I need help,'' 
Clinton said. Without asking his partners, he dropped another ball 
on the tee to take a mulligan, or repeat shot; That ball followed 
the path of the first. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aw, I did it again,'' the president said. He pointed to the  
adjacent tee and said, ``I should have teed up over there.'' He 
drove Lee away in the cart. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Clinton seems to be having a happier vacation this year  
than he did last year, amid the immediate aftermath of the 
president's speech to the nation acknowledging he hadn't told the 
truth about his relationship with former White House intern Monica 
Lewinsky. There were demands for more complete apologies. The 
tension between the president and the first lady was clear. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, those clouds appeared to have parted even though the  
actual weather on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard was 
cool and overcast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons greeted a crowd of 250 people gathered at the  
Edgartown home of Viacom executive Frank Biondi and his wife, 
Carol, to pledge support and money for Mrs. Clinton if she makes 
her expected run for the Senate seat from New York being vacated by 
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons passed up church services in anticipation of the  
late-morning political brunch, which raised $1,000 per ticket for 
the first lady's potential political future. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton spoke, but the president did not.  
</P>
<P>
	However, Clinton, who has never entirely gotten over his days as  
a high school band member in Arkansas, honored a request by an 
unidentified couple celebrating their 35th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	He picked up a saxophone and joined Resonance, a high school  
jazz band providing the entertainment, to play the requested song, 
``My Funny Valentine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guest list numbered some of the Vineyard summer residents  
that the White House staff refers to as ``the usual cast of 
characters.'' They included Clinton friends Vernon Jordan, Steven 
Rattner, Dick Ebersol and Maurice Tempelsman. Also attending were 
humor columnist Art Buchwald, lawyer Alan Dershowitz and Mrs. 
Clinton's former spokeswoman, Lisa Caputo. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, the Clintons journeyed to a restaurant in nearby Oak  
Bluffs to a birthday celebration for longtime aide Kelly Craighead.

<HEADLINE> SKorea Leader Nixes Cronkite Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- President Kim Dae-jung has rejected an  
appeal by Walter Cronkite to stop a South Korean company from 
building an apartment complex in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The retired CBS newsman asked Kim in a letter early this month  
to persuade Daewoo Corp. not to build the 90-story tower, 
presidential spokesman Park June-young said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daewoo building would be the world's tallest residential  
tower and would dwarf the nearby 39-story U.N. building. Cronkite 
lives in the neighborhood and belongs to a group campaigning to 
stop construction of the building because it would overshadow the 
U.N. complex. 
</P>
<P>
	The tower is to be finished by 2001 under a $180 million  
contract with Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not a matter in which the Korean government or president  
should be involved and it should be handled in accordance with U.S. 
law,'' Kim's office said in a statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
	The Internet has much to teach children, but a lot of it you  
don't want them to learn -- at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
	It's pretty easy to control when and where -- or if -- a toddler  
goes online, but it's a different story with those in elementary 
school. Although filtering software will block sites with adult 
content (and some innocent sites as well), that doesn't address 
kids corresponding with adults pretending to be children. 
</P>
<P>
	While the first danger that pops into a parent's head may be  
sexual predators, a burglar trolling the Net for possible targets 
would be delighted to learn from a seven-year-old that ``We don't 
have a dog because Mom and Dad are at work and when I'm at school 
it couldn't go out when it had to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A perfect solution probably doesn't exist, but parents of  
children in the 3-12 range might want to check out something called 
JuniorNet. 
</P>
<P>
	JuniorNet is an advertisment-free online service for children  
that establishes a safe, fun and educational area by using CD-ROM 
software that, once an Internet connection is made, restricts the 
users to the site. 
</P>
<P>
	The CD-ROM is the source of multimedia graphics, so download  
time is reduced, important for a target audience not famous for 
patience. And each child in a family is ``authorized'' to the site 
by a parent, who can set parameters for both outgoing and incoming 
messages. That allows children to talk with each other in a much 
more benign environment than ordinary chat rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The content of JuniorNet has a good educational underpinning and  
includes Weekly Reader, Highlights For Children (remember Goofus 
and Gallant?), Sports Illustrated For Kids, Ranger Rick and 
Zillions, a sort of Consumer Reports for the set whose major income 
is an allowance. 
</P>
<P>
	There are all sorts of activities and the e-mail alone ought to  
provide hours of boredom relief. And for those wrestling with 
homework, there's an online reference center with various 
encyclopedias from World Book, Oxford and Marshall and a 
dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
	The user interface is hip and cartoonish and installation is  
simple. System requirements are Internet service, Windows 95/98, at 
least a 133-megahertz Pentium, eight-speed CD-ROM or better, 32 
megabytes of memory, SoundBlaster or compatible sound card and at 
least 60 megabytes of hard disk space. 
</P>
<P>
	I had only two negative observations, one minor, the other maybe  
not so minor. 
</P>
<P>
	The minor: The central character and overall guide is a blue bug  
named Clik. On the copy of JuniorNet I reviewed, someone needs to 
synchronize Clik's sound and lip animation. 
</P>
<P>
	The major: While it's true that the software doesn't allow kids  
to surf the net at random, there are circumstances where closing 
the program doesn't terminate the Internet connection. That means 
12-year-olds can then open a browser and pursue their interest in 
comparative anatomy while parents still think they're using Ranger 
Rick. 
</P>
<P>
	The bug happens if you have both Internet Explorer and Netscape  
Navigator installed on your PC and Navigator is your default 
browser, Microsoft Network is the Internet provider and you first 
start JuniorNet before firing up net access. The temporary solution 
is to first make the Internet connection and then start JuniorNet 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	R. Patrick Johnson, chief technical officer for JuniorNet, says  
the company hopes to have the bug stomped by the next release of 
the software, due in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	JuniorNet costs $9.95 a month billed to a credit card after a  
trial period. More information and a demo are available at 
http://www.juniornet.com.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Gains; Corn, Soybeans Retreat / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures gained Monday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, while corn and soybean futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn and soybeans fell after beneficial rains fell in Midwest  
and Delta growing regions over the weekend, and were expected to continue 
into midweek. 
</P>
<P>
        Some investors also were expecting prices to retreat to profit-taking  
as harvest pressure begins to set in, but the outlook remained uncertain 
ahead of weekly crop ratings that were due late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
        The U.S. Agriculture Department's reports for the past few  
weeks have shown sharp deterioration in corn and soybean fields across 
the nation because of an extended drought. But some market participants 
predicted the recent rainfall will help some of the crop rebound, and 
tours of major growing states were finding expected yields per bushel 
to be higher than expected. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.88 a bushel;  
December corn fell 2 1/2 cents to $2.20 a bushel; December oats fell 
1/4 cent to $1.14 a bushel; November soybeans fell 2 cents to $4.70 
3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef futures retreated, while pork futures rose sharply on  
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
        October live cattle fell .75 cent to 64.70 cents a pound; October  
feeder cattle fell .40 cent to 77.77 cents a pound; October lean hogs 
rose 1.77 cents to 46.42 cents a pound; February pork bellies rose 
the limit 3 cents to 58.32 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Some Services Offered by Phone Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some services offered by phone companies to give consumers more  
information about their calls: 
</P>
<P>
	--Make a mad dash to the phone as it rings but still miss it?  
Offered by some phone companies as 69, the increasingly popular 
Call Return enables users to trace who called them, letting them 
decide whether to ring that person back. In many regions, customers 
can subscribe to the feature instead of just paying per call. 
</P>
<P>
	--For those who don't want their number identified, companies  
offer blocking for outgoing calls. This prevents the number from 
showing up on the recipient's Caller ID. 
</P>
<P>
	--Incoming calls can be blocked as well. For example, some  
carriers offer a services enabling customers to program certain 
phone numbers they do not want to get calls from. Callers from 
those numbers receive a message saying the recipient is not 
accepting their call. 
</P>
<P>
	--Couch potatoes who can't be bothered to reach for the phone  
when it rings can see who is calling right on their television 
screen with a Caller ID enhancement by Southwestern Bell. Another 
feature reads aloud the number of the incoming call. 
</P>
<P>
	--Distinctive ring features help phone users to sort their calls  
without adding lines. Some companies let customers get several 
numbers for the same line -- each with its own ringing pattern -- to 
indicate which number the caller is trying to reach. Other carriers 
also offer distinctive rings for specific incoming numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ameritech introduced its Talking Call Waiting service earlier  
this month. Following the Call Waiting ``beep'' that lets a phone 
user know someone else is calling, this feature then announces the 
incoming caller's name. Only the call recipient can hear the 
announcement.

<HEADLINE> Commodity Prices May Hurt Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal bank regulators are keeping a watchful  
eye on financial institutions that lend to businesses affected by 
the slump in prices for farm and industrial commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	If the price slide persists, the lending institutions could  
suffer losses, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. warned in a 
report issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FDIC is carefully monitoring the effects that low prices  
are having on local economies that depend heavily on commodity 
industries,'' said Donna Tanoue, who heads the deposit insurance 
agency. ``We know from experience that local economic adversity has 
the potential to result in problems'' for banks and thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for corn, soybeans, wheat and other crops have been  
depressed for the second year in a row because of huge harvests 
worldwide and the recent economic crises in Asia and Russia, which 
also have helped pushed down prices of chemicals, steel, oil and 
natural gas, though the energy commodities have since rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a tremendous drop in some of these commodity  
prices,'' said Carl Tannenbaum, senior vice president and chief 
economist at LaSalle Banks in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC's Regional Outlook report for the third quarter notes  
that a similar price slump in the 1980s triggered a ``rolling 
recession'' that spread through the Plains states and the oil 
producing regions of the south-central and western states. The 
decline of farm land values starting in 1981 contributed to the 
failure of hundreds of banks in agricultural regions between 1984 
and 1990, while falling oil prices in the mid-1980s played a role 
in the failure of banks and thrifts in Texas, Oklahoma and 
Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the report says, financial indicators show that ``the  
level of credit risk (for banks and thrifts) associated with 
commodity industries may be on the rise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are signs of rising credit losses among local  
(financial) institutions in counties with the highest 
concentrations of agriculture and oil and gas extraction,'' the 
report says. ``A continuation of today's weak pricing picture in 
these industries has the potential to result in higher credit 
losses for (financial) institutions during the next few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While banking problems of the magnitude of the 1980s are not  
expected this time, persistent low commodity prices, coupled with 
uncertainty about future federal farm programs, pose ``significant 
risks'' to banks in farm areas, the FDIC says. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, because those banks have higher levels of  
capital and reserves against loan losses than in the 1980s, they 
appear to be better prepared to absorb the risk, the report 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the worst case will prevail,'' Tannenbaum said  
in a telephone interview. Banks in the region have set aside more 
money to cover potential losses and agricultural demand in Asia has 
started to improve, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the incidence of defaults on bank loans in the region  
has been minimal, Tannenbaum added.

<HEADLINE> Schilling May Return in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Phillies ace Curt Schilling,  
who was eligible to come off the disabled list Monday, probably 
won't be activated until Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's progressing,'' Phillies manager Terry Francona  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling last pitched Aug. 7, then tried to rest his ailing  
shoulder and give it a jolt with a cortisone shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia was 12 games above .500 and very much alive in the  
NL wild-card race when Schilling was hurt, then went 4-9 and 
dropped 10 games back in the wild-card chase. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies got help Monday for a bullpen that has been  
battered in Schilling's absence, sending left-handed starter 
Anthony Shumaker to Triple-A Scranton and calling up right-handed 
reliever Joe Grahe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies have three off-days this month, but need a starter  
on Aug. 31 at San Francisco. Francona did not close the door on 
bringing Schilling back for that start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't envision us activating Schilling until Sept. 1,''  
Francona said. ``We'll have to see how that week goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Carlton Loewer, recovering from a stress fracture  
in his humerus bone, threw well in a simulated game Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``His fastball looked stronger now than when he left,'' Francona  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Loewer is expected to go to Florida as early as Thursday to  
begin a rehab assignment. If all goes well, he also could return 
Sept. 1.

<HEADLINE> Boise State Defensive Tackle Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Paul Reyna, a freshman defensive tackle at  
Boise State, died Monday after being hospitalized following a head 
injury last week. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement issued by the school's athletic department said  
Reyna, 19, died at 5:20 p.m. EDT in the intensive care unit at 
Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyna suffered a torn blood vessel between his brain and skull,  
and the bleeding developed into a blood clot. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery immediately after Wednesday night's injury relieved  
pressure on Reyna's brain. However, sports information director Max 
Corbet said the damage was too severe and led to Reyna's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyna was hurt in Boise State's first scrimmage of fall  
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	He apparently hit his head on the artificial turf. The 270-pound  
lineman from La Puente, Calif., walked off the field but complained 
of discomfort while sitting on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics administered oxygen and intravenous fluids before  
taking him to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service, open to the public, is scheduled for Tuesday  
at the Student Union Building on campus.

<HEADLINE> Vols Anxious To Get Lewis Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee was the best team in the  
nation last year without its top running threat. Now the Vols 
welcome back Jamal Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the start of another big game in what was becoming an  
increasingly good season for Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 67 yards to score the first time he touched the ball  
against Auburn Oct. 3, but felt a twinge in his right knee in the 
second half. He left for treatment on the sidelines and returned 
for one play. He gained 21 yards to push his total to 140 yards on 
18 carries, then hobbled off with what turned out to be a 
season-ending injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Lewis has fully recovered from the torn lateral  
collateral ligament is one of the biggest questions for Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great,'' said Lewis, a junior from Atlanta who added  
some muscle with his offseason training. ``My speed is great, the 
agility is there. I'm up to 233 (pounds), but it's not a heavy 
233.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis has spent the past 10 months rehabilitating the knee. He  
said the worst parts were going to class on crutches and ``doing 
the same old boring exercises every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis worked out with most of the other players on campus this  
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kind of tantalized me this summer,'' quarterback Tee Martin  
said. ``He'd come out and run two or three plays and sit back 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis had a limited spring practice and was off-limits to  
tacklers, which coach Phillip Fulmer says he would have done even 
without the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jamal is fine,'' Fulmer said. ``We'll get him out there and  
get him tackled a couple of times, and I guess you guys will quit 
asking me that. He made all the cuts in the spring. He's done a 
heck of a job with his rehab work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking forward to getting him the feel of a game again  
because it's been a long time since he's played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The high anticipation for Lewis' return is understandable. He  
didn't start until the fifth game of his freshman season in `1997, 
and still had the sixth-highest freshman rushing total in NCAA 
history (1,364 yards). 
</P>
<P>
	He was averaging 124 yards a game last season before the injury  
(497 yards in four games). 
</P>
<P>
	As for his expectations this year, Lewis said, ``I just want to  
get as many yards as it takes for us to win the football game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His return pushes the two Travises, Henry and Stephens, back  
onto the bench. Henry finished the season with 970 yards and 
Stephens added 477 as Tennessee led the Southeastern Conference in 
rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer has said the Vols may use a split-back set some this  
season, with Henry and Lewis in the same backfield, but that the 
basic offense won't change just because the Vols are deep at 
tailback. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's their job to please me, not my job to please them,  
necessarily,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Plead Case Before NLRB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Umpires cited unilateral changes made to the  
strike zone and changes to the job evaluation process among the 
reasons the National Labor Relations Board should seek an 
injunction to keep 22 umps for being let go next week. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 44-page brief submitted to the NLRB, the Major League  
Umpires' Association said the union's power and status had been 
undermined by the decision of the American and National leagues to 
accept the resignations of 22 umpires while letting 35 other umps 
withdraw theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	``An injunction is necessary because the leagues' unlawful,  
pervasive conduct has effectively undermined the MLUA's position as 
the collective bargaining representative of the umpires,'' said the 
brief, which was submitted to the NLRB last week and released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least 10 labor lawyers exhausted hundreds of hours of  
research in developing this document,'' union head Richie Phillips 
said in a letter to umpires that accompanied the brief. ``There are 
people in baseball who are attempting to inflict as much pain as 
possible on many of our members. Someday soon they will be held 
accountable for this senseless, reprehensible, corrupt behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners responded through their new outside lawyer, Howard Ganz  
of Proskauer Rose LLP, who has played a prominent role for the NBA 
owners in their labor struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganz, according to a management official speaking on the  
condition he not be identified, told the NLRB that most of the 
matters raised by the union should be decided by an arbitrator and 
that many of the union's accusations are unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, owners submitted tapes of the umpires' public  
statements last month in an effort to prove the union planned a 
walkout in violation of the no-strike clause in their labor 
contract, the management official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union claimed that when umpires announced their mass  
resignations on July 14, they weren't really planning to walk out 
but wanted to voice their anger at baseball's treatment of them. 
Umpires said Sandy Alderson, an executive vice president in the 
commissioner's office, threatened to fire low-rated umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``It strains credibility to conclude that seven-eighths of the  
bargaining unit, including many umpires with years left in their 
careers, actually intended to sever their employment with the 
leagues,'' the brief said. ``Instead ... the resignations must be 
viewed as a symbolic gesture aimed at inducing discussions between 
the two sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after the July 14 meeting, several umpires said  
publicly the action was taken to induce bargaining. Owners have 
cited a provision in labor law that prohibits bargaining until the 
final 60 days before a collective bargaining agreement expires. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires say Alderson's memo last February redefining the strike  
zone and the decision to no longer use former umps to evaluate 
current umpires were unfair labor practices, and they filed an 
unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB last month. The board 
has not yet decided whether it will issue a complaint and hasn't 
indicated whether it will rule before Sept. 2, the day the 22 umps 
are scheduled to be let go. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leagues' unilateral changes to the strike zone and umpire  
evaluation process constituted significant changes in the umpires' 
terms and conditions of employment,'' the brief said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the NLRB issues a complaint, it could ask a federal judge to  
issue an injunction to keep the 22 umps on the job.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' QB To Miss Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Jake Plummer's sprained right thumb will  
keep him out of Arizona's preseason game Saturday at Seattle, and 
the Cardinals' quarterback wants to take a cautious approach as the 
injury heals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've said seven to 10 days,'' Plummer said after he watched  
the Cardinals practice Monday. ``By the end of this week I hope to 
be able to grip the football and have a little strength in it, 
maybe throw light tosses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer was injured on the third play of Friday night's home  
game against Tennessee when he was sacked by Mike Jones. Plummer 
was to be examined by a hand specialist on Monday to make sure the 
injury isn't more serious. 
</P>
<P>
	With the hand was wrapped in a tight bandage, Plummer joked  
about learning how important a thumb is. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize that it does separate us from other mammals,'' he  
said. ``I went and had some sushi and realized even using 
chopsticks is kind of tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer might be back for Arizona's final preseason game at home  
against Oakland on Sept. 3. Regardless, he expects to be ready for 
the regular-season opener at Philadelphia on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just got to make sure I give it the right amount of time  
and not rush it,'' he said. ``If I rush it, it might not heal all 
the way and could bother the velocity on my ball and gripping the 
ball and all that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer said he had no gripes about Jones grabbing his thumb.  
</P>
<P>
	``His hand hit the ball. I almost fumbled the ball,'' Plummer  
said. ``I kind of wish I had fumbled it now because he wouldn't 
have held onto my thumb. I switched hands and he hung onto my 
thumb. It was just a defensive guy trying to make the sack and make 
the tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to grab whatever he gets his hands on, and it  
happened to be my thumb. It wasn't a dirty play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer said he hasn't been injured since he was a freshman at  
Arizona State, a remarkable statistic considering how often he 
scrambles with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	In Plummer's absence, former New York Giants starter Dave Brown  
will get extensive practice time with the first unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good just to get going with guys like Frank Sanders and  
David Boston and some of the other guys I really haven't had a 
chance to work with,'' Brown said. ``God forbid, if something does 
happen to Jake down the line, I think working with those guys a 
little bit more extensively in the preseason will help me out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Vince Tobin said he isn't sure how Plummer's absence will  
affect the quarterback rotation in the Seattle game. Normally, he 
said, the first-string quarterback would stay in the game into the 
third quarter, then would play fewer minutes in the following game. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Plummer can come back against Oakland, Brown and the rest  
of the first unit may play less this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever happens, third-string quarterback Chris Greisen, a  
rookie who led Northwestern Missouri State to the NCAA Division II 
title last season, will see considerably more playing time than he 
would have otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Greisen has impressed the Cardinals' coaching staff.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's done very well,'' Tobin said. ``He's a very mature young  
man. He's very poised, and he's got some ability.''

<HEADLINE> Magazine Wants Isuzu To Drop Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An Isuzu lawsuit against the publisher of  
Consumer Reports should be dismissed because the automaker failed 
to show the magazine fabricated results that Isuzu Troopers were 
prone to tip in sharp turns, attorneys for the consumer group said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers Union researchers were thorough and fair in stability  
tests they did on the Trooper in 1996, putting it through the same 
paces as dozens of other sport-utility vehicles the group has 
tested, attorneys said in court papers seeking to dismiss the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Isuzu sued in 1997, saying Consumers Union researchers drove the  
Trooper recklessly, trying to deliberately tip the vehicle up on 
two wheels. The automaker is seeking unspecified damages, saying 
the magazine's report hurt Trooper sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer Reports gave the vehicle a rare ``not acceptable''  
rating, warning consumers not to buy the Trooper because of the 
danger of rollovers. The only other sport-utility vehicle that 
received such a rating from Consumer Reports was the Suzuki 
Samurai, prompting a similar lawsuit against the magazine by 
Suzuki. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Norton, spokesman for Consumer Reports, said the magazine  
stands by its findings about the Trooper. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Cotchett, an attorney for Consumers Union, asked U.S.  
District Court Judge Richard Paez to dismiss the lawsuit. 
Regardless of whether the story was accurate, Paez should throw out 
the case because Isuzu has offered no evidence of malice by 
Consumers Union or that the group knowingly rigged the tests, 
Cotchett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Isuzu relies on outside criticism of Consumer Reports' methods  
but fails to present facts to prove the watchdog group acted in bad 
faith, Cotchett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they have is a series of statements from test drivers,''  
Cotchett said. ``That's what their case is based on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isuzu said the test drivers in Consumer Reports' research turned  
the Trooper's steering wheel faster and farther than motorists 
would in a real-life emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Reports' research amounted to a ``test of what the  
driver does,'' said Andrew White, an attorney for Isuzu. 
</P>
<P>
	Memos by Consumer Reports researchers before the findings were  
published indicate that the magazine knew the results were flawed 
or at least that the group ``had serious doubts,'' White said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paez reserved judgment and did not indicate when he would rule  
on whether to let the case go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A ruling on a Consumers Union request to dismiss the Suzuki case  
is pending before another judge.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Golfs on Martha's Vineyard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- On vacation and acting like it,  
President Clinton played golf on Martha's Vineyard for the first 
time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in khaki shorts and a blue sport shirt, Clinton spent  
about 10 minutes at the driving range, then took his first tee shot 
Monday at the Farm Neck Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aw, I killed it. I came over. I need help,'' Clinton said.  
Without asking his partners, he put another ball on the tee to take 
a mulligan, or repeat shot. That ball followed the path of the 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aw, I did it again,'' the president said. He evaluated his  
second effort, pointed to the adjacent tee and said, ``I should 
have teed up over there.'' He drove away with Boston businessman 
Thomas Lee in a golf cart toward their next shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The foursome also included Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and  
New York investment banker Matt Gohd. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Clinton's first golf excursion on Martha's Vineyard since  
his vacation here in 1997. Last year, the president mostly stayed 
indoors with his family, which was reeling after he admitted to the 
nation that he had had a relationship with former White House 
intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	That vacation was not a happy one, but this year the president  
and first lady seem far more relaxed and at ease. He also played 
golf on Friday on Nantucket. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night, they planned to attend a fund-raiser for the  
Martha's Vineyard Hospital, a fifth straight night out on the town. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons were asked to attend by their friend Vernon Jordan,  
said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``He relayed a request 
from the trustees who were doing this fund-raiser ... and the 
president happily agreed to help in this worthwhile effort,'' 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Jordan, too, was a focus of the Lewinsky inquiry,  
questioned by investigators about his efforts to find her a job 
outside the government. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the socialization, the president hasn't had much time  
to dig into the large bag of books he hauled along on this 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	The selections included ``Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story  
of Risk'' by Peter L. Bernstein, a history of risk and probability; 
``Cold Hit,'' the latest Alexandra Cooper book by Linda A. 
Fairstein; ``Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies'' 
by Jared Diamond, and ``Memoirs of Hadrian'' by Marguerite 
Yourcenar, a look at the second century Roman Empire originally 
published in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also brought along Michael Knox Beran's ``The Last  
Patrician: Bobby Kennedy and the End of American Aristocracy'' and 
``Waves of Rancor: Tuning in to the Radical Right'' by Robert 
Hillard and Michael Keith.

<HEADLINE> Ky. GOP Gains Unprecedented Majority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- Republicans will gain control of the  
Kentucky Senate for the first time in state history thanks to a 
Democratic senator's defection to the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Bob Leeper announced he will make the switch this  
week, becoming the second state senator to jump ship in the last 
six weeks and breaking a 19-19 deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you do become a clear majority, that is a new day,''  
Republican Caucus Chairman Charlie Borders said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The defections take Republicans from their previous 20-18  
minority to a 20-18 majority. As recently as nine years ago, 
Democrats held 30 of the 38 Senate seats. The party still has firm 
control of the House, with 65 of 100 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans held a majority in the legislature only once,  
controlling the House for a single year in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats had tried to change Leeper's mind, ushering him in for  
private sessions with Democratic Gov. Paul Patton and also 
promising retribution when he is up for re-election in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Leeper said he felt more comfortable with GOP philosophy and  
politics, the same reason given by state Sen. Dan Seum, whose 
switch last month left forced a tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' undoing may have been their own fault.  
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders  
enlisted the support of Republicans when he and a small group of 
Democrat renegades ousted the Senate's previous president in his 
bid for the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders repaid his debt to the GOP earlier this year by making  
Republicans chairmen of several committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Seum and Leeper had refused to pledge allegiance to  
Saunders, costing them their committee chairmanships. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the latest defections, Saunders may remain in power. The  
GOP has not yet decided whether to depose him, and Saunders claims 
he was elected to a two year-term as president and cannot be 
removed until that term expires. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. David Williams, the Senate's Republican leader, said he  
doesn't want to foreclose any options with the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will need them to govern effectively,'' Williams said.  
``That's why I'm not ruling out anything.''

<HEADLINE> Web Site Offers Props From TV Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just when it seems the World Wide Web has every  
possible stock price, song lyric, celebrity photo and how-to book, 
here's a new idea: putting clothes, furnishings and props from TV 
shows within the click of a mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Since May, AsSeenIn.com has received more than a million hits,  
helping viewers search for duplicates of one of Susan Lucci's 
glamorous gowns, perhaps, or even a lamp from another favorite 
program. ``Live like the stars!'' the site trumpets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans want to know where they can find certain outfits,'' said  
Sam Baldoni, who runs the site. ``Everybody that we talked to about 
this site has fallen in love with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, AsSeenIn.com shows where to buy items from three  
shows: Spelling Television's ``7th Heaven'' and ``Charmed,'' and 
Spelling Entertainment's ``Any Day Now.'' Spelling is a major 
shareholder in the site. 
</P>
<P>
	When the site launches in full next month, links are planned for  
three more shows -- ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' ``Safe Harbor,'' and 
the daytime drama ``Sunset Beach.'' The site may eventually include 
items from movies and clothes seen on award shows, Baldoni said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, surfers can click on ``Charmed'' and choose a room to  
peek inside, or pick a link to one of the stars' wardrobes. But 
some apparel doesn't lead visitors to another Web site. It's like 
spotting a dream dress in a display window of a closed store. 
</P>
<P>
	AsSeenIn.com does offer links to Web sites for Pier 1 Imports  
and Lucent Technologies, for instance, but the featured products 
are not always available online. Instead, AsSeenIn.com tells where 
to surf for items that can be bought on the Internet, and provides 
store locations for items that cannot. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, that may help its success, an analyst says.  
</P>
<P>
	Irma Zandl, president of a Manhattan retail consulting firm that  
advises on consumers under the age of 30, said many still limit 
their Web purchases to books, music or electronics. With other 
purchases, she said, they want to have something in hand first, or 
fear they won't be able to make a return. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a lot of kids say, 'If I can't try it, I don't buy it,'''  
Ms. Zandl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juliet Schor, an author and Harvard University lecturer,  
believes consumers' pursuit of television characters' make-believe 
trappings could be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``When twentysomethings can't afford much more than a  
utilitarian studio, but think they should have a New York apartment 
to match the ones they see on 'Friends,' they are setting 
unattainable consumption goals,'' she writes in her book, ``The 
Overspent American.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism notwithstanding, television and Internet executives  
are scurrying to exploit the interest in props seen on popular TV 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, for example, has begun an experiment in writing products  
into entertainment story lines. 
</P>
<P>
	A silver-dipped pewter bracelet showed up as a gift to a star  
character on the daytime drama ``Guiding Light'' and was played up 
as a bauble with a mysterious past. Now, fans can buy a replica for 
$29.95 on the network's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot more people just don't notice commercials,'' Ms. Zandl  
said. ``Having it be part of the story is going to be, certainly, a 
wave of the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while Zandl worries TV plots could suffer from the desire to  
please advertisers, Baldoni sees only the upside of his site. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, he said, advertisers can reach audiences through a  
new venue, television producers get many of their props free -- and 
his company gets a cut of anything bought through his site.

<HEADLINE> Ward May Boost Jets Passing Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Keyshawn Johnson is tall, athletic and  
strong. Wayne Chrebet is shifty, energetic and selfless. Quinn 
Early is experienced and versatile. 
</P>
<P>
	Dedric Ward? He's the gamebreaker.  
</P>
<P>
	At least that's what the New York Jets hope to get from the  
third-year receiver with the sub-4.4 speed and steadier hands. 
Ward, a former college sprinter, has learned to run more precise 
routes, and his upgraded play could lead to more time on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward, the Jets' third wideout behind Pro Bowler Johnson and  
third-down star Chrebet, made a strong showing in last Friday's 
10-9 victory over Philadelphia. Given a chance to play with the 
first unit, Ward caught six passes for 104 yards. He beat veteran 
cornerback Bobby Taylor for a 39-yard reception that led to a field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dedric is doing well,'' coach Bill Parcells said Monday.  
``Let's see if he keeps it going. He's made steady progress from 
his first year to his second year to now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was talking to him a little bit about that today. He had a  
real good offseason and has done everything you could have hoped 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets were careful not to rush Ward after he was selected in  
the third round in 1997 out of Northern Iowa. At first, Parcells 
believed Ward would be a kick returner, something Ward did well in 
college. But it wasn't an area of need with Leon Johnson emerging, 
so Ward had to settle for a slow development as a fourth receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	After an 18-reception rookie year, Ward showed signs of  
blossoming last season, averaging 19.1 yards for 25 catches and 
scoring three touchdowns. The highlight was a game-clinching 
43-yard TD at New England on Monday Night Football. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward followed that with a 71-yard TD reception in a victory at  
Buffalo that clinched the team's first division title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am out there doing my job, trying to find my niche in the  
offense,'' Ward said. ``I am a big-play guy, trying to be a 
sparkplug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly what Ward was in the rain against the Eagles. He  
and Vinny Testaverde hooked up on a 15-yard completion on third 
down, then the 39-yarder to get the Jets on track. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were sputtering early,'' Ward said. ``I was trying to make  
something happen. I wanted to do what I do best, and that's make 
big plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He just might get the chance to make them on a regular basis  
this season. New York's passing game is most balanced when it can 
utilize Ward's speed with Johnson's power and Chrebet's sneakiness. 
Johnson might make the more acrobatic catches and Chrebet finds 
openings few others can, but neither can get deep the way Ward can. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells called Ward the most improved player on the team during  
a minicamp. The coach's subsequent actions didn't necessarily 
support that -- he signed free agent Early, sparking speculation 
Ward's spot as the third wideout was in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	But the way Parcells has used Ward makes it clear what the coach  
is thinking. He's thinking about going deep with Dedric.

<HEADLINE> Mickelson Steams About Crenshaw  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALOHA, Ore. (AP) -- First, Phil Mickelson blistered the course on  
the opening day of the Fred Meyer Challenge charity tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he bristled about Ben Crenshaw, calling the Ryder Cup  
captain's recent criticism of him ``out of line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson, gaining momentum as the temperature climbed near 90  
degrees, had two eagles to carry his team into a share of the lead 
after Monday's opening round of the $1 million best-ball 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson and teammate Jay Haas finished at 11-under-par 61 at  
the 7,037-yard Reserve Vineyards and Golf Club course west of 
Portland. Billy Andrade and Brad Faxon had an eagle on No. 16 and a 
birdie on 17 to also finish 11 under. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phil really played a great round of golf,'' Haas said. ``He  
only fell asleep on a couple of holes, and I just happened to be 
there. It was a relaxed day for me. I was just cheering him on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson waved to the grandstand after a group of fans yelled,  
``How's the baby?'' in reference to his daughter Amanda, born the 
day after the U.S. Open two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But his mood dimmed in the clubhouse, when he was asked about  
the lingering controversy over whether Ryder Cup players should be 
paid. During the PGA Championship last month, an angry Crenshaw 
picked out Mickelson, along with David Duval, Tiger Woods and Mark 
O'Meara as players who wanted a say in how the PGA of America 
spends its profits from the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not say anything to the media. I did not say a word,''  
Mickelson said Monday. ``I didn't say what my views were. All Ben 
said was he was disappointed in me. That was a confidential 
meeting. He was out of line. 
</P>
<P>
	``And you'll have to ask him why he was disappointed in me.''  
</P>
<P>
	Three teams were tied for second at 10-under 62: Billy Mayfair  
and Steve Pate, Craig Stadler and Steve Elkington and Brian 
Henninger and Tim Herron. Mayfair and Pate had an eagle on 15, then 
made three birdies to complete the round. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold Palmer and tournament founder Peter Jacobsen, who have  
been teammates for all 14 years of the tournament, were last 
heading into Tuesday's final round at 4 under. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrade, angry after missing a 4-foot birdie putt on 15, eagled  
the par-5 16th. He hooked his drive but it gave him a good look at 
the flag. He used a 4-iron to get onto the green, and made a 
30-foot putt to pull to 9 under. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to redeem myself on that putt at 16,'' Andrade said.  
</P>
<P>
	On the par-5 15th, Mickelson's second shot landed about 8 feet  
from the cup and he made the eagle putt to go 10 under. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson's first eagle came on an 18-foot putt on the par-4,  
305-yard 5th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	On 16, Mickelson's drive landed just in the right rough, and his  
second shot went screaming toward a crowded tent to the left of the 
green before it curled right, bounced and rolled to the fringe 
above the hole. His chip for eagle was a few inches to the right, 
and he tapped in for birdie.

<HEADLINE> UAW Votes To Authorize Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- United Auto Workers have voted overwhelmingly to  
authorize a strike -- if necessary -- against Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW on Monday released the results of the  
strike-authorization vote, held Aug. 17, with 96.4 percent in favor 
of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tremendous turnout and overwhelming majority vote clearly  
reflect the solidarity and unity of the UAW-Ford membership across 
America,'' said UAW Vice President Ron Gettelfinger. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW this year sought to have all its Ford members cast votes  
on the same day rather than over several, as is typical for strike 
authorization votes. The votes are held every three years before 
national contract negotiations intensify in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan didn't quite work, since some of the 43 Ford locals  
across the country set their own voting schedule. The UAW 
represents about 101,000 production and skilled trades workers at 
Ford facilities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to have all Ford voting on one day led to speculation  
that the UAW was trying to signal its displeasure with the No. 2 
automaker over its possible spinoff of the Visteon Automotive 
Systems Corp. parts unit. The union opposes a spinoff of Visteon, 
which has about 28,500 UAW members. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts questioned how important that was, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``What's most important is that there's been significant  
profitability in the industry,'' said David Gregory, a labor 
professor at St. John's University School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
	Between high profitability and the traditionally good  
management-labor relations between Ford and the UAW, a solid 
contract likely will emerge from the talks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most stable, the most predictable (relationship) is  
between Ford and the UAW,'' Gregory said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current contracts with Ford, General Motors Corp. and the  
Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG expire Sept. 14.

<HEADLINE> British Burn Capital, Aug. 24, 1814 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fires reddened the sky in towers of flame  
that could be seen 50 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The deck officers on the ships in the British invasion fleet,  
anchored in the darkness of the Patuxent River near Chesapeake Bay, 
remarked there was a fire in the direction of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	A British Army lieutenant, returning from Bladensburg, the  
Maryland battlefield where the American forces had been routed, 
recalled that the fires so brilliantly lit the sky that ``a dark 
red light was thrown upon the road sufficient to permit each man to 
view distinctly his comrade's face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Georgetown College, on the heights above the Potomac River,  
John McElroy, the school's bookkeeper, looked across the city, then 
at his pocket watch. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a neat journal entry: ``Aug. 24, 1814 -- This evening  
about dark the British arrived in W.C. (Washington City), fired the 
Capitol about 9:06.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President James Madison, a fugitive on horseback in the Virginia  
countryside, saw the burning city and shuddered at what a member of 
his party called ``the dismal sight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest telling of the story is by Anthony S. Pitch in ``The  
Burning of Washington: The British Invasion of 1814,'' published by 
the Naval Institute Press in Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The late summer of 1814 had been hot, steamy and rainless. The  
war between Britain and the United States that had sputtered for 
two years had been a distant rumble at best. 
</P>
<P>
	But the defeat of Napoleon in Spain that spring had freed the  
veterans of the Duke of Wellington's army for duty in America. 
Their officers were in a mood for reprisal. The year before, U.S. 
forces had burned government buildings in York (now Toronto), the 
capital of the Canadian province of Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans, seeking to keep vital supplies out of British  
hands, struck the first match, lighting fuses at the Washington 
Navy Yard to destroy ammunition, sails, masts, lumber, pitch, 
ropes, even a frigate at its moorings. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Capitol, the two British commanders, Army Gen. Robert  
Ross and Adm. George Cockburn, ordered rockets fired through the 
roof of the House chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the roof failed to ignite, a few soldiers clambered up,  
only to find it covered with sheet iron,'' Pitch writes. 
``Undeterred, they made a bonfire of wooden furniture in the center 
of the chamber, setting it alight with the rocket's combustible 
material. Flames quickly engulfed the mahogany desks, tables and 
chairs ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Capitol burning behind him, Cockburn led a file of  
silent British sailors the mile down Pennsylvania Avenue to the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Dolley Madison had remained at the president's house  
as long as possible. But by 3 p.m. she could hear distant cannon. 
Messengers soon arrived with word the battle had been lost. In a 
famous action, she ordered Gilbert Stuart's full-length portrait of 
George Washington to be taken from its frame and carted away. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cockburn arrived he found the White House deserted. But the  
table in the State Dining Room was set for 40, with food and wine 
ready to serve. 
</P>
<P>
	The British officers consumed their commandeered dinner with  
toasts to success and sneers at ``little Jemmy Madison.'' Then, one 
of Cockburn's lieutenants remembered, ``they finished by setting 
fire to the house that had so liberally entertained them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our sailors were artists at their work,'' wrote Army Capt.  
Harry Smith. The interior of the president's house collapsed within 
a shell of fire-scorched sandstone walls. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, around midnight, came a storm whose pure destructive  
fury would have been talked about for years even if it had not been 
associated with the end of an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bolts of lightning illuminated scenes of chaos,'' Pitch  
writes. Whipping winds ripped off roofs and ``carried away feather 
beds.'' Several British cannon were tumbled away like a hand 
sweeping paperweights off a table. 
</P>
<P>
	And the fires slowly sputtered and died.  
</P>
<P>
	``Great God, madam, is this the kind of storm you are accustomed  
to in this infernal country?'' Cockburn asked one of the many 
Washingtonians who kept journals of the events of 1814. 
</P>
<P>
	The victorious British Army was soon marching out of Washington.  
Unexpectedly, the War of 1812 had just two more acts. 
</P>
<P>
	The British fleet and army were repulsed before Baltimore, where  
Gen. Ross was killed. Francis Scott Key, scribbling by ``the 
rockets red glare,'' wrote the words to ``The Star Spangled 
Banner.'' The British were defeated again, this time decisively, at 
New Orleans. By then a peace treaty ending the war had been signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 185 hot and steamy summers later, President Clinton enjoys  
ushering visitors, especially the British, onto the Truman Balcony 
of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	There, a square of sandstone wall has been left unpainted. The  
black soot marks of the British fire are etched into the absorbent 
stone. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Dow Soars 199 to Record Close / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average soared to a new  
record Monday as investors banished fears that the Federal Reserve 
will raise interest rates repeatedly in its bid to quell inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a broad-based, steady advance, the Dow rose 199.15 to close  
at 11,299.76, easily surpassing its July 16 record close of 
11,209.84. With Monday's gains, the Dow is up 23 percent for the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose sharply, although they remain  
below their record highs of mid-July. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 
rose 23.61 to 1,360.22, and the Nasdaq composite index rose rose 
71.24 to 2,719.57. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's rally occurred on light volume, as many traders were on  
vacation and many investors stayed on the sidelines, awaiting the 
Fed's announcement on interest rates Tuesday afternoon. 
Nonetheless, the rally lifted most sectors, with fledgling Internet 
companies, battered drug stocks and multinational consumer 
companies all rising. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a legitimate, strong demand to own stocks,'' said  
Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said investors have grown comfortable with the  
expectation that the Fed will raise short-term interest rates 
Tuesday in its continuing effort to contain inflation. Most 
economists expect the central bank to raise rates a 
quarter-percentage point, matching the increase imposed on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Since higher interest rates can cut into corporate profits,  
stocks have faltered since the Fed first raised the possibility of 
a second rate increase. The market's recovery comes from the 
growing belief that the Fed may hold rates steady after Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though the Fed may raise rates tomorrow, there is some  
real evidence that the economy is slowing,'' said Hugh Johnson, 
chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. Johnson cited the 
nation's widening trade deficit and an expected slowdown in the 
growth of the U.S. gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial and technology companies benefited most from Monday's  
rally. J.P. Morgan soared 6 13/16 to 139 3/4, and American Express 
gained 3 1/2 to 146 3/8, pacing the Dow to its new heights. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services companies are especially sensitive to  
interest rate fluctuations. Higher rates make companies less likely 
to borrow money, cutting into lending volume and potentially 
slowing the pace of mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks buoyed the Nasdaq. Amazon.com rose 4 15/16 to  
118 3/8, and Yahoo! shot up 7 1/8 to 152 1/8. Many of those stocks have been 
driven down recently by concerns over interest rates as their high 
prices and often weak earnings drove investors in search of less 
risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Merger activity enlivened trading. United Water Resources rose 2  
7/16 to 33 1/2 after French utility Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux launched a 
$35-per-share bid to acquire full ownership of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market also provided strong support for stocks Monday.  
Prices rose, and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond edged down 
to 5.98 percent from 5.99 percent late Friday. The yield is down 
sharply from its recent high of 6.27 percent; at that level it 
provided investors with a more attractive alternative than volatile 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rally in the bond market has clearly lifted spirits,''  
said Johnson. ``There's a real sense of relief that long-term bond 
yields have declined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Monday's advance, the Dow has risen 49.9 percent from its  
low point late last summer, when a host of global financial crises 
hurt U.S. stocks. The S&AMP;P 500 has risen 42.1 percent since last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	While analysts were surprised by Monday's rally, many believe  
the market can extend its gains once the interest rate question is 
put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not seeing the kinds of conditions that lead to the end  
of a bull market,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 833.54 
million shares, compared with 791.62 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.87 to 437.25.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes rose solidly, due in part to the strength on  
Wall Street over the past two sessions. Japan's Nikkei stock 
average rose 0.75 percent. Germany's DAX index rose 0.7 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 2.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.3 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Saberhagen Placed on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Boston right-hander Bret Saberhagen was  
placed on the 15-day disabled list Monday because of a weak 
throwing shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was retroactive to Aug. 18, a day after the two-time Cy  
Young Award winner was chased after just two innings in a 12-1 loss 
to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox had hoped a week's rest would help Saberhagen, but  
instead they placed him on the DL for the third time this season. 
In May he was out with a strained shoulder and in June he was 
sidelined with a cut on his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen is 9-5 with a 3.36 ERA in 18 starts.  
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder Damon Buford, who had been sidelined with a rib cage  
injury, was activated from the 15-day DL. The Red Sox optioned 
right-hander Brian Rose to Triple-A Pawtucket and recalled 
right-hander Tomokazu Ohka from the Paw Sox.

<HEADLINE> AP Union Leader Peecook Dies at 57 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- James Patrick ``Jim'' Peecook, a longtime  
Associated Press technician and leader of the union representing 
AP's technical employees, died Monday of complications from a 
stroke. He was 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Peecook headed the Communications Workers of America negotiating  
team in each of the last four contract talks with the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Peecook, who died at West Paces Medical Center, had been  
hospitalized since suffering a stroke Feb. 26. He had undergone 
three heart operations, most recently in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always admired the way Jim continued to fight through his  
illness and work for those whom he represented -- both the union 
members and the members of the AP,'' said Gary Clark, chief of 
bureau for Georgia and Alabama. ``That kind of courage is a rare 
commodity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James M. Donna, AP vice president and director of Human  
Resources in New York, said, ``Jim had the respect of people on 
both sides of the bargaining table and his death is a loss for all 
of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peecook started his AP career in 1960 as a 19-year-old office  
assistant in Cleveland. He moved up to ``operator attendant'' in 
1961 and transferred to Atlanta in 1968 as an ``automatic 
operator,'' typing news copy on the Teletype machines that 
distributed Associated Press stories around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	As computers replaced Teletypes, Peecook became a technician in  
1974, installing and repairing AP equipment in AP offices and 
member newspaper and broadcast stations throughout Georgia and 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	He was active in union affairs throughout his career, becoming  
chairman of the General Committee of the United Telegraph Workers 
in 1987. When the UTW merged with the CWA later that year, his 
title changed to president of CWA Local 1314. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta AP technician Craig Davis, formerly first vice  
president, takes over for his longtime friend as president. Peecook 
was the fifth president of the union representing AP's technical 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Terri; three children, Renee, Jimmy  
and Lenny; two grandchildren, his mother and three brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	A requiem Mass will be celebrated Thursday in Cumming, Ga.

<HEADLINE> Lost Hawaii Hikers Rescued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Two Danish women spent eight cold, rainy nights  
stranded on a steep trail with light clothing and little food, 
shivering, hugging and massaging each other to stay warm. 
</P>
<P>
	The two 20-year-old tourists were finally rescued Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We thought about our families and we couldn't let them down,''  
said Marianne Konnerup from a hospital bed. ``The easiest thing to 
do up there was to say, `OK, bye.' We didn't want to do that, we 
just wanted to keep on fighting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only food they had was two apples and two bagels each, said  
Anitta Winther. They had several bottles of water, but that soon 
ran out. 
</P>
<P>
	``When one week went by, you don't really realize that you're  
hungry anymore. You don't think about food so much,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	They licked dew off leaves in the morning and on their final day  
found they could squeeze water from moss. 
</P>
<P>
	The women, from Farsoe, Denmark, had set out for a one-day  
outing Aug. 14, hiking up a ridgeline in the back of a rugged 
tropical valley on the windward side of Oahu, 15 miles north of 
Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	The trail became difficult and steep and they became trapped,  
not daring to go up or back down, Winther said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trails in the area have some of the most treacherous hiking  
conditions in Hawaii, said Dick Davis, former president of the 
Hawaiian Trail and Mountain Club. Unwary hikers could easily plunge 
20 to 30 feet down cliffs, and anyone trying to follow a valley 
stream toward the beach would have a difficult time getting through 
brush, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Search parties were sent to look for the women.  
</P>
<P>
	``We saw a lot of airplanes and helicopters and we yelled at  
people and we could hear the dogs on the ground and music on the 
ground, but nobody could hear us scream,'' Winther said. ``It was 
really frustrating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, they finally managed to climb and crawl down the  
rocky, heavily vegetated ridgeline trail, and after four hours came 
in contact with searchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came and gave us water. It was so wonderful,'' said  
Konnerup. 
</P>
<P>
	Suffering from mild dehydration, sunburn and scratches, they  
were treated at Kahuku Hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't say anything. I just kissed her, and we cried  
together, and nothing more,'' said Konnerup's father, Per, who flew 
in from Denmark after learning his daughter was missing. ``It's the 
happiest day of my life, simply. I cannot describe it to you. It's 
not possible.''

<HEADLINE>  Prognosis Good for Bengals' Moore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- While safety Kelvin Moore recovers from a  
broken bone in his neck, the Cincinnati Bengals are struggling to 
deal with a familiar set of emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in three years, one of their players has  
suffered a severe neck injury that threatens his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore was in stable condition Sunday at a hospital in Pontiac,  
Mich., two days after he broke a vertebra in his neck while making 
a tackle in a preseason game against the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore has feeling in his arms and legs and is expected to make  
``an excellent recovery,'' team Dr. Robert Heidt Jr. said. There's 
no way to tell whether Moore, 24, will ever play again. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching film of the play, coach Bruce Coslet said Moore  
did everything right and still got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like he was a little bit stumbling into him and just  
bent his head back,'' Coslet said. ``It just happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It brought back memories of how offensive lineman Scott  
Brumfield was hurt on Nov. 3, 1996, in a game in Baltimore. 
Brumfield banged heads with teammate Troy Sadowski and was 
temporarily paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	Brumfield made a full recovery from a spinal cord concussion and  
played for the Bengals in 1997, appearing in 15 games and starting 
three. He partially tore an anterior cruciate ligament in his knee 
early in training camp in 1998 and agreed to an injury settlement, 
ending his career with the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore's injury also brought back memories for Detroit fans.  
Former Lions Mike Utley and Reggie Brown suffered severe neck 
injuries this decade and had to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``With these powerful athletes flying around and the collisions  
they generate, sometimes you wonder why there's not more of them,'' 
Coslet said. ``But when it happens, it's devastating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of the game, and injury always has been part of the  
game. When it becomes career-ending or life-threatening or whatever 
other adjective you want to use, it puts things in perspective 
quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coslet, general manager Mike Brown and a couple of coaches  
briefly visited Moore in Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital after Friday 
night's game.

<P>
	``He was pretty much out of it, but I think he recognized who  
was in there,'' Coslet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore will be transferred to USC University Hospital in Los  
Angeles, near his family's home, in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Coslet said he thinks about serious injuries more now than when  
he was a player. He was a tight end with the Bengals from 1969-76. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're that age, you're Superman. The bullets can't hurt  
you,'' Coslet said. ``I don't know if it's because of age or 
because I've been through this a couple of times now, but you 
reflect a little bit more and it affects you more. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing you can do about it, but that doesn't deter  
you from thinking about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore was on the Bengals' practice squad for most of last  
season, after he signed as a rookie free agent. He was in line to 
be part of the Bengals' special teams this season and play as an 
extra defensive back on passing downs. 
</P>
<P>
	His injury came one week after cornerback Ric Mathias hurt his  
knee, ending his season. Defensive back Tremain Mack was suspended 
for four games by the NFL on Friday for his alcohol-related 
arrests, further depleting the position. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to say, `Hey, we can't let this affect us,' and  
that's tough to do right now,'' Coslet said. ``But you've got to go 
on.''

<HEADLINE> Poet Patricia Beer Dies at 79 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Patricia Beer, the British poet lauded by her  
American contemporary Robert Lowell for her wry handling of eternal 
themes, has died at 79, her husband said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Parsons said his wife died of a stroke on Aug. 15 at their  
home at Honiton, in southwest England. 
</P>
<P>
	Beer was born in Exmouth, southern England, into a family of  
strict Plymouth Brethren -- a religious link she later severed, but 
which profoundly marked her. 
</P>
<P>
	In her 1968 prose memoir, ``Mrs. Beer's House,'' she gives a  
compelling account of her life in the stern, inward-looking 
religious community until the age of 14. 
</P>
<P>
	After Exmouth Grammar School, Exeter University and Oxford, she  
went to Italy, lecturing at the University of Padua from 1946-48, 
at the British Institute in Rome from 1948-50, and the Ministero 
Aeronautica in Rome from 1950-53. 
</P>
<P>
	On her return to Britain in 1953, she began writing poetry for  
the first time since her schooldays, exploring the themes of death, 
aging and faith in immaculately described English landscapes 
inspired by her heroes William Wordsworth and Thomas Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell relished her wit and restraint -- ``like Elizabeth  
Bishop's, though on a smaller scale,'' he wrote, referring to the 
Pulitzer Prize-winning American poet. 
</P>
<P>
	She published her first collection, ``The Loss of the Magyar and  
Other Poems,'' in 1959, and continued to produce a small volume of 
new poems every four or five years for the rest of her life. Her 
work ranges widely through personal, anecdotal and historical 
subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Her publisher, Michael Schmidt, described her as ``lucid,  
cannily innocent; she apprehends death with a secularized religious 
imagination; she accepts the inescapable, vivid materiality of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From 1962-68, she taught at Goldsmiths College in London, where  
she explored the literature of the 19th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Her scholarly work includes ``Reader, I Married Him,'' a study  
of the major 19th century female novelists and their female 
characters that anticipated the growth of feminist criticism. She 
also wrote a historical novel, ``Moon's Ottery,'' published in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
	She contributed to many journals, notably The London Review of  
Books, and had recently completed the libretto for a Millennium 
Oratorio. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she left the Plymouth Brethren, she retained her  
religious faith, converting to Roman Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
	She is survived by her husband, an architect. The funeral will  
be held Tuesday in Honiton.

<HEADLINE>  Prognosis Good for Bengals' Moore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- While safety Kelvin Moore recovers from a  
broken bone in his neck, the Cincinnati Bengals are struggling to 
deal with a familiar set of emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in three years, one of their players has  
suffered a severe neck injury that threatens his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore was in stable condition Sunday at a hospital in Pontiac,  
Mich., two days after he broke a vertebra in his neck while making 
a tackle in a preseason game against the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore has feeling in his arms and legs and is expected to make  
``an excellent recovery,'' team Dr. Robert Heidt Jr. said. There's 
no way to tell whether Moore, 24, will ever play again. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching film of the play, coach Bruce Coslet said Moore  
did everything right and still got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like he was a little bit stumbling into him and just  
bent his head back,'' Coslet said. ``It just happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It brought back memories of how offensive lineman Scott  
Brumfield was hurt on Nov. 3, 1996, in a game in Baltimore. 
Brumfield banged heads with teammate Troy Sadowski and was 
temporarily paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	Brumfield made a full recovery from a spinal cord concussion and  
played for the Bengals in 1997, appearing in 15 games and starting 
three. He partially tore an anterior cruciate ligament in his knee 
early in training camp in 1998 and agreed to an injury settlement, 
ending his career with the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore's injury also brought back memories for Detroit fans.  
Former Lions Mike Utley and Reggie Brown suffered severe neck 
injuries this decade and had to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``With these powerful athletes flying around and the collisions  
they generate, sometimes you wonder why there's not more of them,'' 
Coslet said. ``But when it happens, it's devastating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of the game, and injury always has been part of the  
game. When it becomes career-ending or life-threatening or whatever 
other adjective you want to use, it puts things in perspective 
quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coslet, general manager Mike Brown and a couple of coaches  
briefly visited Moore in Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital after Friday 
night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pretty much out of it, but I think he recognized who  
was in there,'' Coslet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore will be transferred to USC University Hospital in Los  
Angeles, near his family's home, in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Coslet said he thinks about serious injuries more now than when  
he was a player. He was a tight end with the Bengals from 1969-76. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're that age, you're Superman. The bullets can't hurt  
you,'' Coslet said. ``I don't know if it's because of age or 
because I've been through this a couple of times now, but you 
reflect a little bit more and it affects you more. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing you can do about it, but that doesn't deter

<HEADLINE> Art Dealer Leo Castelli Dead at 91 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anyone can discover an artist, Leo Castelli once  
said, ``but to make him what he is, give him importance, that's 
really discovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To the many American contemporary masters he promoted, Castelli,  
who died Sunday at age 91, was the quintessence of that vision -- an 
art dealer with an independent eye and a mind to match. 
</P>
<P>
	In fostering the careers of such painters as Robert Rauschenberg  
and Jasper Johns, admirers say he brought an energy and 
congeniality to the landscape of modern art he helped define. 
</P>
<P>
	Castelli died at his home on Manhattan's Upper East Side  
following a short illness, said Amy Poll, a family spokeswoman. A 
private service was held early Sunday evening at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Rauschenberg and Johns, Castelli's stable  
included Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, James 
Rosenquist, Robert Morris, Ellsworth Kelly, Kenneth Noland, Cy 
Twombly, Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Bruce Nauman, Richard Serra and 
Andy Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first saw the work of Johns and Stella, I was bowled  
over,'' Castelli said in 1984. ``I just feel sheer, pure 
enthusiasm. And then you get feedback from a mysterious consensus 
out there that you are right. Then, of course, you intensify your 
push and drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though some of his most famous artists defected to other dealers  
during the churning 1980s, Castelli's New York galleries were hot 
houses for major talents in the schools and styles that arose in 
post-war America and made New York the center of contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in the forefront in promoting the successors to abstract  
expressionism -- pop artists, minimalists and conceptualists. Author 
Danielle Gardner titled him ``a modern Medici, the man who sold 
Europe on contemporary American art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castelli's eye for what would sell brought his galleries  
millions of dollars worth of sales yearly, but Castelli put much of 
it back to nurture artists who had not yet found a market. 
</P>
<P>
	During his rise to pre-eminence among dealers in the 1960s, he  
told an interviewer that he only followed where art led, not vice 
versa. ``One has to accept what painters do. One does not have to 
like it, but one cannot discard it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Serra once recalled that when Castelli discovered him in 1963,  
the dealer guaranteed him monthly payments for three years without 
expectation of selling any of his sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like getting a Rockefeller grant,'' Serra said. ``Leo  
has always been generous, supportive, intimate and friendly, a 
throwback to another century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been learning from exhibitions at his gallery -- and from  
him -- for 30 years,'' Nan Rosenthal, 20th-Century curator of the 
National Gallery in Washington, said a few years ago. ``It's Leo's 
intelligence, and his loyalty to his artists, that makes him so 
extraordinary. It's not been about the business, but a passion for 
the art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times in the mid-'60s when you felt that if you  
didn't get to Leo's every other day, you were going to miss out on 
something,'' collector Victor Ganz once told an interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
	Castelli was born in Trieste in 1907 of well-to-do, socially  
prominent parents. He was educated in Milan and dabbled in the 
insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
	His marriage in 1933 to Ileana Schapira, daughter of a wealthy  
Romanian industrialist, led to a job in Paris and indulgence in the 
couple's interest in modern art. 
</P>
<P>
	Castelli opened a gallery in Paris with Rene Drouin, an  
architect and designer. Their first and only show, a surrealist 
exhibit, in 1939, was a success. Then World War II erupted and 
Castelli, a Jew, made his way to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving with U.S. Army intelligence, and receiving  
American citizenship as a consequence, Castelli tried his hand in a 
sweater manufacturing business set up by his father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pull of art led him from collecting to promoting and he  
helped finance the landmark Ninth Street Show of 1951, an exhibit 
of 61 abstract expressionists. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, at age 50, he and his wife opened a small gallery in  
their townhouse home on East 77th Street and began looking for 
artists headed in new directions. Johns, Rauschenberg and Stella 
were among his early stars. 
</P>
<P>
	He also arranged European exposure for his artists, an effort  
crowned in 1964 when Rauschenberg became the first American to win 
the grand prize of the Venice Biennale. 
</P>
<P>
	Castelli and Ileana divorced in 1960 and he married Antoinette  
Fraissex du Bost in 1963. The second Mrs. Castelli died in 1987. He 
married Barbara Bertozzi in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Castelli had a daughter, Nina Sundell, from the first marriage  
and a son, Jean-Cristophe, from the second.

<HEADLINE> Rain Sinks Grains, Soybeans Futures / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybeans futures opened lower today on  
the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for more rains beneficial 
to crops this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Some profit-taking was expected as harvest pressure begins to  
set in, but the outlook remained uncertain ahead of a weekly crop 
report due after trading ends today. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department's reports for the past few weeks  
have shown sharp deterioration in corn and soybean fields across 
the nation because of an extended drought. But some market 
participants predicted recent rainfall will help some of the crop 
rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainfall is expected to continue into Wednesday in the eastern  
Midwest. The southern Midwest and Delta are expected to get higher 
rainfall amounts as Tropical Storm Bret has forced precipitation 
north from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 1 1/4 cents to $2.85 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn was down 2 1/2 cents to $2.20 a bushel; December oats 
were down 1 1/4 cents to $1.13 a bushel; November soybeans fell 10 1/4 
cents to $4.62 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle prices were lower and feeder cattle prices were  
mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while pork futures were 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle fell 0.13 cent to 65.32 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle were down 0.02 cent to 78.15 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs were up 1.25 cents to 45.90 cents a pound; and 
February pork bellies were up 1.38 cents to 56.70 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE>  Greene Wants To Be Complete Sprinter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- He's enjoying the best season of any male  
100-meter sprinter in history -- breaking the world record, running 
under 10 seconds nine times and winning his second world title. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Maurice Greene still has something to prove.  
</P>
<P>
	A day after capturing the gold medal at the World Championships  
in 9.80 seconds, just short of his own world record, Greene said he 
won't be considered a truly great sprinter until he completes a 
100-200 double. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be the complete sprinter, that's practically every  
sprinter's goal,'' Greene said Monday. ``He wants to show the 
versatility, that he's not just a 100-meter sprinter, that he can 
also run the 200 meters. I believe that's what makes you great, 
when you can do both and not just stick to one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene will get his chance this week when he bids to become the  
first man to win both sprints at the World Championships, and the 
first at any major championship since Carl Lewis at the 1984 Los 
Angeles Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The 200 heats are scheduled for Tuesday, the semifinals  
Wednesday and the final Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene also is competing in the 400-meter relay in a bid for  
three gold medals. He said he would run in all the rounds, not just 
the final, and would probably run the anchor leg. The relay final 
in next Sunday on the final day of the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that (100) race last night, my mind has quickly switched  
to the 200 meters,'' said Greene, relaxing at a sponsor's lounge 
near the stadium. ``I have to start concentrating on that and do 
the things I have to do to win a double.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If not for his manager, Emanuel Hudson, Greene might not have  
been going for the double at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's open, if he tells you truthfully, he didn't want to  
run the 200 this year,'' Hudson said. ``I've been telling him that 
to be considered a real runner you've got to win both races. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way the public and media perceive an athlete, they don't  
put you in the great category until you cross categories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson pointed to the example of Michael Johnson, who  
accomplished a historic 200-400 double at the 1995 worlds and 1996 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael Johnson has run more sub 43s than anybody in the 400  
meters,'' he said. ``But he was everything when he won the 200 and 
the 400. So I said, `Maurice, you're the world champion in the 100, 
you should take this to the 200.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson said he also motivated Greene by citing all the attention  
being paid to Marion Jones' historic bid for four gold medals in 
Seville and five at next year's Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him, `You're the world champion and you're dominating  
in the 100, but everybody's still talking about Marion Jones. You 
know why? Because Marion is saying I'm going to win five gold 
medals, going to get this and that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene is still relatively unproved in the 200, where the  
technique of running the bend contrasts with the straight dash in 
the 100. Greene won the U.S. 200-meter title this year in his 
season's best time of 19.92. 
</P>
<P>
	His chances of victory in the 200 in Seville have been bolstered  
by the absence of his friend and training partner, Ato Boldon, the 
reigning 200 champ who is out with an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The big question is whether former world champion Frankie  
Fredericks of Namibia, who scratched from the 100-meter final with 
a thigh injury, will line up for the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll find out when it starts,'' Greene said. ``I don't worry  
about any other runner. If he's in, he's in. If he's out, he's out. 
I still have to run the same race whether he's in the race or 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that race is anything like Sunday night's 100 final, watch  
out. Despite a slight stumble out the blocks, Greene blazed to the 
second-fastest time ever, just .01 off the world mark of 9.79 he 
set in Athens, Greece, on June 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``That little problem I had at the beginning of the race -- that  
was the world record,'' said Greene, who had hoped to run 9.76. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene brought his career total of sub-10 second races to 25,  
just one short of the all-time record held by Fredericks. Greene 
has recorded those times over a period of just three years. By 
comparison, Carl Lewis ran only 15 sub-10s in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene has taken the 100 meters to a new level. Now it's a  
matter of seeing just how far he can lower the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say I can only run this time,'' he said. ``If  
I say that, I'll believe once I run that time, that's as fast as I 
can go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe as time progresses man will get faster. I'm not  
going to limit myself to only one time. I believe I'll always be 
able to run faster. I haven't run the perfect race yet. If one day 
I do, we'll see what happens.''

technique of running the bend contrasts with the straight dash in 
the 100. Greene won the U.S. 200-meter title this year in his 
season's best time of 19.92. 
</P>
<P>
	His chances of victory in the 200 in Seville have been bolstered  
by the absence of his friend and training partner, Ato Boldon, the 
reigning 200 champ who is out with an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The big question is whether former world champion Frankie  
Fredericks of Namibia, who scratched from the 100-meter final with 
a thigh injury, will line up for the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll find out when it starts,'' Greene said. ``I don't worry  
about any other runner. If he's in, he's in. If he's out, he's out. 
I still have to run the same race whether he's in the race or 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that race is anything like Sunday night's 100 final, watch  
out. Despite a slight stumble out the blocks, Greene blazed to the 
second-fastest time ever, just .01 off the world mark of 9.79 he 
set in Athens, Greece, on June 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``That little problem I had at the beginning of the race -- that  
was the world record,'' said Greene, who had hoped to run 9.76. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene brought his career total of sub-10 second races to 25,  
just one short of the all-time record held by Fredericks. Greene 
has recorded those times over a period of just three years. By 
comparison, Carl Lewis ran only 15 sub-10s in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene has taken the 100 meters to a new level. Now it's a  
matter of seeing just how far he can lower the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say I can only run this time,'' he said. ``If  
I say that, I'll believe once I run that time, that's as fast as I 
can go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe as time progresses man will get faster. I'm not  
going to limit myself to only one time. I believe I'll always be 
able to run faster. I haven't run the perfect race yet. If one day 
I do, we'll see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Ventura Returns to Wrestling Roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- He was ``The Body'' in the ring. Then, after  
winning the governor's mansion, he insisted on being called ``The 
Mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Gov. Jesse Ventura returned to his less cerebral  
roots in a paid wrestling appearance that generated as much 
political controversy as sweat-stained glitz. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was right back in character. He looked pretty happy up  
there,'' said Kyle Eggleston, 24, of River Falls, Wis., one of 
19,404 rowdy onlookers who packed the Target Center for the World 
Wrestling Federation's SummerSlam event. 
</P>
<P>
	During much of the three-person title match -- involving Stone  
Cold Steve Austin, Triple H and Mankind -- Ventura barked orders, 
but shied away from joining the action. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're in my state now,'' Ventura shouted at Triple H before  
the match got under way. ``I am law and order here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, wearing a long-sleeved, black-and-white referee shirt,  
drew standing ovations and chants of ``Jesse! Jesse!'' throughout 
the match. 
</P>
<P>
	He was more than eager to factor into the outcome. He refused to  
proclaim Triple H the winner even after he had Mankind pinned on 
the mat. Instead, Ventura sat in a corner of the ring, wagging his 
finger and smiling at the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Mankind won by pinning Austin, but not before Ventura physically  
threw Shane McMahon, son of WWF owner Vince McMahon, out of the 
ring when he tried to butt in. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura grabbed McMahon by the face, swung him around and  
hoisted him over the ropes, dropping him to the floor. Ventura and 
the elder McMahon have been enemies ever since Ventura successfully 
sued McMahon over royalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party governor, who retired from the ring in 1986  
because of injury, exhibited a sense of accomplishment just being 
at an event most politicians would shy away from. 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, Ventura deflected criticism for accepting the role.  
Some said he was abusing and degrading his office. Others charged 
he was sending the wrong message by appearing at a WWF spectacle 
complete with vulgar chants, guitar-shattering violence and 
scantily clad women making suggestive gestures. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of media saying I'm a disgrace for being here.  
I'll tell you this: I'm proud of wrestling. I'm proud I was a 
wrestler, and I'm proud to be here tonight,'' Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Ramsey County judge gave Ventura legal clearance to referee  
last week by refusing to issue a restraining order sought by a 
write-in candidate for governor, Leslie Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	For Ventura, the wrestling ring was familiar ground. Sunday's  
event -- which also was carried to millions of fans on pay-per-view 
TV -- wasn't even the first time Ventura officiated in the main 
SummerSlam event. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's stint as referee in a 1988 SummerSlam match involving  
Hulk Hogan, Macho Man Randy Savage, Andre the Giant and the Million 
Dollar Man Ted DiBiase is little more than an entertainment 
footnote. 
</P>
<P>
	His appearance at ``An Out of Body Experience'' -- as this year's  
event was billed -- promised to be much more. 
</P>
<P>
	His take from SummerSlam -- an event that brought the WWF $29.95  
per subscriber -- could reach seven figures. Ventura has said he 
will donate to charity the $100,000 fee he was given to referee. 
</P>
<P>
	But wrestling experts say he also was likely to receive at least  
$1 million in video royalties and for the use of his trademarked 
name. Ventura has repeatedly declined to say how much money he'll 
pocket from his appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Throngs of fans came to Ventura's defense.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's all in good fun,'' said Jason Anschutz, 16, of Circle  
Pines. ``If people take it too seriously they need to re-evaluate 
what they're thinking. It's all entertainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others seemed uneasy. Don Copp, 68, called it ``one of the worst  
experiences of my life'' -- and that was only a few minutes into the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	But even Copp tempered his remarks when it came to Ventura.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of governors make fools of themselves,'' Copp said.  
``Jesse's not the only one.''

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Cans Foie Gras Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Smithsonian Institution canceled a  
celebration of foie gras -- a delicacy produced by the forced 
feeding of ducks and geese -- after complaints from animal rights 
advocates including Sir John Gielgud. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials suspected that ``something untoward'' might happen at  
the session, spokesman David Umansky said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his staff spoke with a cross-section of 120 people who  
had paid $25 and $30 for the evening and they were concerned as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	The program ``Foie Gras: A Gourmet's Passion'' had been  
scheduled for Sept. 21 to include a talk by Michael Ginor, whose 
Hudson Valley farm in Ferndale, N.Y., makes the product. Following 
a panel discussion, samples of foie gras, French for ``fat liver,'' 
were to have been served with a glass of wine. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kuemmerle, in charge of farm animal programs for the  
Humane Society of the United States, said he was pleased the 
Smithsonian complied with the wishes of the public, including 
Gielgud, the British Shakespearean actor. 
</P>
<P>
	``These animals are tortured to produce the abnormally large and  
fatty livers, and no responsible institution should abet this 
unmistakable inhumane treatment of animals,'' Kuemmerle said in a 
statement this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Mara Mayor, director of the Smithsonian Associates, which runs  
lectures and performances in collaboration with the museums, 
promised full refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we are always concerned with the well-being of our  
participants, we have regretfully concluded that it would be in the 
best interests of everyone involved to cancel the program,'' she 
wrote to ticket-holders. 
</P>
<P>
	In a first response to the protest, Ms. Mayor wrote to the  
Humane Society that her group tried to reach the broadest possible 
number of people and would judge the response by the tickets sold. 
That letter did not say anything about canceling the program.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Mixed Ahead of Fed Decision / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term bond prices edged higher but  
intermediate and short-term Treasury securities slipped Monday, a 
day ahead of a meeting of the Federal Reserve Board's 
policy-setting committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts expect that the Fed will nudge short-term rates  
higher Tuesday for the second time in eight weeks in a bid to slow 
down the economy. The higher rates would make bonds already in 
circulation, especially ones with shorter maturities, less 
attractive to investors, forcing their rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/32  
point, or 31 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield was 
unchanged at 5.98 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were down 1/32 point, and intermediate maturities were down 1/16 
point to 1/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.98 percent as the  
discount rose 0.16 percentage point to 4.85 percent. Six-month 
yields were 5.14 percent, as the discount rose 0.06 percentage 
point to 4.94 percent. One-year yields were 5.18 percent as the 
discount rose by 0.04 percentage point from late Friday to 4.92 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.00 percent from 4.94 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/32 point to 113 points. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.86 percent from 5.85 percent.

<HEADLINE> Underwood To Meet With Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Rookie defensive end Dimitrius Underwood,  
wavering between his faith and an NFL career, planned to meet 
Tuesday with Miami Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson to discuss his 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unlikely Underwood will play this season, said his agent,  
Craig Domann. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a chance. I don't think it's a big chance,'' Domann  
said Monday. ``The more likely scenario is it's 2000, or plausibly 
not at all. ... I sense he's leaning toward not coming back (to 
football), probably ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota Vikings drafted Underwood in the first round in  
April, but he left training camp after one practice, saying he was 
struggling to balance football and his religious beliefs. The 
Vikings released Underwood, and he was claimed off waivers last 
week by the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has said he's in no hurry for the former Michigan State  
star to join the Dolphins because they have five veteran defensive 
ends this season.

<HEADLINE> Air Travel in W. Africa Adventurous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- It was snack time on the flight to  
Liberia, and the steward stumbled a bit as the small plane rolled 
with the turbulence in the West African skies. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd already brought the passengers their inflight lunches --  
glasses of powdery orange drink and chewy bread rolls. Now he was 
carrying refreshments to the front of the plane: beer for the 
cockpit crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Few passengers even looked up much less looked aghast.  
</P>
<P>
	While travelers in the West grumble about late arrivals and  
dirty planes, expectations in West Africa are not high. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a region where on-time flights are the exception, where  
Soviet castoff planes find new lives and where more than one 
airline is known as ``Air Maybe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Travelers exchange tales of flights that are 23 hours late, of  
planes that simply never arrive, of fellow passengers carrying goat 
carcasses on board. 
</P>
<P>
	And the trouble isn't just in the air.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, a Kenya Airways jet that landed at the Lagos,  
Nigeria, airport was blocked by bandits who proceeded to open a 
hatch and carry away baggage as the crew and passengers watched in 
stunned disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not just a case of growing pains for the world's  
less-developed nations. Travelers in East Africa report far fewer 
problems. Ethiopian Airlines, for instance, has long had a 
reputation for high-quality service and on-time flights. 
</P>
<P>
	In West Africa, passengers grumble openly about epidemic  
tardiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talking about 'flight delays' on Cam-Air is just stating the  
obvious,'' said Cameroonian passenger Jean Mengui of Cameroon 
Airlines' service. 
</P>
<P>
	The region's airlines must contend with political meddling,  
inadequate funding and the need to cover a multitude of tiny 
countries -- all the while overshadowed by Air Afrique, the 
stumbling behemoth of West African airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	A cooperative owned by 11 African countries, Air Afrique used to  
be the Holiday Inn of regional air travel -- a dependable, 
not-quite-fancy airline. It's green and white emblem became a 
symbol of African pride amid stories of economic failure. 
</P>
<P>
	But these days, it's in trouble. Four of its planes were seized  
by creditors last year, and the company is scrambling for 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the problems, many West Africans speak fondly of  
their airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	In a region better known for its wars, poverty and ethnic  
strife, the airlines can mean a lot for national pride. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident rate in Africa is eight times the world average,  
according to the Flight Safety Foundation, a nonprofit group based 
in Virginia. But the foundation says it has no breakdowns for the 
various African regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Anecdotal evidence indicates there have been few major crashes  
in West Africa and that many flights go off without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghana Airways may be routinely tardy, but to artist John Nsakyi,  
the airline ``is lovely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fact is that flying a West African airline is to sample the  
life of the continent. It may be disorganized, but it's always 
interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	On-board births are not unknown, and illiterate men often ask  
around for people who can fill in their landing cards, then share 
stories of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Nsakyi says the friendliness outweighs the problems: ``You know,  
the hospitality is great.''

<HEADLINE>  Bret Downgraded to Tropical Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVIERA, Texas (AP) -- A blustery shadow of its former self,  
Hurricane Bret was downgraded to a tropical storm today as it 
poured rain across southern Texas, weakening as it went. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries had been reported since Bret, the biggest hurricane  
to strike Texas in nearly 20 years, made landfall about 6 p.m. 
Sunday in Kenedy County. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like a big jet engine was coming down on top of us.  
It was very scary,'' Jesse Salinas said in Sarita, the only town in 
Kenedy County. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little structural damage in Sarita, a town of 460  
people. At least one tornado caused damage elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 25 inches of rain fell by early today on the coastal  
plains of Kenedy County, where the average rainfall for a whole 
year is 29.7 inches, the National Weather Service said. Rain 
tapered off there but continued falling in other parts of the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	And as the storm and its threat of flooding drifted slowly  
toward northern Mexico, evacuations were started in Nuevo Laredo, 
across the border from Laredo. 
</P>
<P>
	The King Ranch occupies much of Kenedy and Kleberg counties.  
Ranch president Jack Hunt said about 50 people were evacuated 
before Bret arrived, leaving some 55,000 head of cattle to fend for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado between Rockport and Aransas Pass destroyed a mobile  
home and damaged several other buildings, the Aransas County 
sheriff's department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage was substantial in Falfurrias, about 60 miles southwest  
of Corpus Christi, Mayor Michael Guerra said. 
</P>
<P>
	The eye passed over the town of about 5,800 residents about 3  
a.m., ripping roofs from homes and businesses, he said. Up to 90 
percent of the town had no electricity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of debris and live power lines in the roads, and  
we've had four convenience stores lose the canopies from their gas 
pumps. And some of the less-structurally sound buildings have lost 
roofs and windows,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Major damage also was reported in Port Mansfield, about 50 miles  
north of Brownsville, especially to mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Power outages were reported from the state's southern tip near  
Brownsville and McAllen to the counties surrounding Corpus Christi, 
said Jessica Mahaffey, spokeswoman for Central Power and Light Co. 
in Corpus Christi. The company serves much of South Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the four major power lines serving the lower Rio Grande  
Valley were down, said Jack Colley, assistant director of the state 
Division of Emergency Management. Demand was low because so many 
people had been evacuated, he said, ``but if the fourth line goes 
down then there is a major problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evacuees were allowed to return to North Padre Island today  
after Corpus Christi police reopened the causeway. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage on the island appeared to be minor, including downed  
signs and an overturned portable toilet at a construction site. 
</P>
<P>
	Susie and Carl Tennison found a tree in their yard on the island  
was cracked. ``Everything else was OK,'' Mrs. Tennison said. 
</P>
<P>
	As of 2 p.m. EDT today, Bret's top sustained wind speed had  
dwindled to 40 mph, with some higher gusts, the National Hurricane 
Center said. The minimum for a hurricane is 74 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Bret had been rated a Category 4 storm when it approached over  
the Gulf of Mexico with 140 mph wind, piling waves 26 feet high at 
one offshore weather buoy, but made landfall with wind down to 125 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, the center of Bret moved across rural southern  
Texas, going west-northwest at 6 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	It was expected to turn westward toward Mexico, where more than  
3,500 people living near the Rio Grande in Nuevo Laredo, just 
across the border from Laredo, Texas, had been evacuated because of 
the possibility of flooding, the government news agency Notimex 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen shelters for evacuees were set up at Nuevo Laredo, said  
civil protection director Ramiro Tellez. 
</P>
<P>
	Three bridges connecting Laredo to Nuevo Laredo were closed to  
large vehicles today and officials said they would be closed to all 
traffic later today because of the threat of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton issued a major disaster declaration Sunday  
night for seven counties, freeing funds to help local governments 
with emergency supplies and debris removal, said FEMA Director 
James Lee Witt. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Allen, another Category 4 storm, struck roughly the  
same area in 1980, causing $55 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas hadn't been hit by a hurricane since Hurricane Jerry  
killed three people in October 1989. However, the state's 
367-mile-long coast has been struck by tropical storms since then, 
including Charley, which dumped 18 inches of rain and killed 19 
people after it moved inland in August 1998.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Montel Williams has been diagnosed with multiple  
sclerosis but told reporters Monday he won't quit his talk show. 
</P>
<P>
	``This disease is not going to stop me,'' said Williams, who was  
accompanied by his wife, Grace, at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how long I've had it for, but I've been  
misdiagnosed for 10 years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 43, is considering several recently approved drugs and  
is starting a fund drive to find a cure for the crippling disease. 
</P>
<P>
	MS is a degenerative disorder of the nervous system. Victims  
typically typically lose some problem-solving capacity and 
short-term memory. Most end up in wheelchairs or need help walking.

year is 29.7 inches, the National Weather Service said. Rain 
tapered off there but continued falling in other parts of the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	And as the storm and its threat of flooding drifted slowly  
toward northern Mexico, evacuations were started in Nuevo Laredo, 
across the border from Laredo. 
</P>
<P>
	The King Ranch occupies much of Kenedy and Kleberg counties.  
Ranch president Jack Hunt said about 50 people were evacuated 
before Bret arrived, leaving some 55,000 head of cattle to fend for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado between Rockport and Aransas Pass destroyed a mobile  
home and damaged several other buildings, the Aransas County 
sheriff's department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage was substantial in Falfurrias, about 60 miles southwest  
of Corpus Christi, Mayor Michael Guerra said. 
</P>
<P>
	The eye passed over the town of about 5,800 residents about 3  
a.m., ripping roofs from homes and businesses, he said. Up to 90 
percent of the town had no electricity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of debris and live power lines in the roads, and  
we've had four convenience stores lose the canopies from their gas 
pumps. And some of the less-structurally sound buildings have lost 
roofs and windows,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Major damage also was reported in Port Mansfield, about 50 miles  
north of Brownsville, especially to mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Power outages were reported from the state's southern tip near  
Brownsville and McAllen to the counties surrounding Corpus Christi, 
said Jessica Mahaffey, spokeswoman for Central Power and Light Co. 
in Corpus Christi. The company serves much of South Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the four major power lines serving the lower Rio Grande  
Valley were down, said Jack Colley, assistant director of the state 
Division of Emergency Management. Demand was low because so many 
people had been evacuated, he said, ``but if the fourth line goes 
down then there is a major problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evacuees were allowed to return to North Padre Island today  
after Corpus Christi police reopened the causeway. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage on the island appeared to be minor, including downed  
signs and an overturned portable toilet at a construction site. 
</P>
<P>
	Susie and Carl Tennison found a tree in their yard on the island  
was cracked. ``Everything else was OK,'' Mrs. Tennison said. 
</P>
<P>
	As of 2 p.m. EDT today, Bret's top sustained wind speed had  
dwindled to 40 mph, with some higher gusts, the National Hurricane 
Center said. The minimum for a hurricane is 74 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Bret had been rated a Category 4 storm when it approached over  
the Gulf of Mexico with 140 mph wind, piling waves 26 feet high at 
one offshore weather buoy, but made landfall with wind down to 125 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, the center of Bret moved across rural southern  
Texas, going west-northwest at 6 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	It was expected to turn westward toward Mexico, where more than  
3,500 people living near the Rio Grande in Nuevo Laredo, just 
across the border from Laredo, Texas, had been evacuated because of 
the possibility of flooding, the government news agency Notimex 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen shelters for evacuees were set up at Nuevo Laredo, said  
civil protection director Ramiro Tellez. 
</P>
<P>
	Three bridges connecting Laredo to Nuevo Laredo were closed to  
large vehicles today and officials said they would be closed to all 
traffic later today because of the threat of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton issued a major disaster declaration Sunday  
night for seven counties, freeing funds to help local governments 
with emergency supplies and debris removal, said FEMA Director 
James Lee Witt. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Allen, another Category 4 storm, struck roughly the  
same area in 1980, causing $55 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas hadn't been hit by a hurricane since Hurricane Jerry  
killed three people in October 1989. However, the state's 
367-mile-long coast has been struck by tropical storms since then, 
including Charley, which dumped 18 inches of rain and killed 19 
people after it moved inland in August 1998.

<HEADLINE> Study: 6 Percent Are Web 'Addicts' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The largest study ever of Internet users has found  
that almost 6 percent -- or more than 11 million users -- suffer from 
some form of addiction to the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, which were released Sunday at the annual meeting  
of the American Psychological Association, appear likely to bolster 
the expanding acceptance of compulsive Internet use as a real 
psychological disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marriages are being disrupted, kids are getting into trouble,  
people are committing illegal acts, people are spending too much 
money. As someone who treats patients, I see it,'' said David 
Greenfield, a therapist and researcher who conducted the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly Young, a pioneer in the new field of research, said the  
study is so broad that it ``adds a layer of legitimacy to the 
concern that Internet addiction is real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 6 percent figure is lower that some earlier  
estimates of 10 percent or more that stemmed largely from research 
on college students. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield, who is a psychologist in West Hartford, Conn.,  
carried out the study jointly with ABC News. He collected 17,251 
responses to an Internet use questionnaire distributed and returned 
through the Web site ABCNEWS.com. 
</P>
<P>
	He adapted his questions from a widely used set of criteria for  
gambling addiction. For example, the questionnaires asked if 
participants had used the Internet to escape from their problems, 
tried unsuccessfully to cut back, or found themselves preoccupied 
with the Internet when they were no longer at the computer. 
</P>
<P>
	If participants answered ``yes'' to at least five of 10 such  
criteria, they were viewed as addicted, just as in gambling. A 
total of 990 participants, or 5.7 percent, answered ``yes'' to five 
or more questions. With an estimated 200 million Internet users 
worldwide, that would mean that 11.4 million are addicts. 
</P>
<P>
	The question about using the Internet as an escape yielded more  
``yes'' answers than any other: 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield's analysis of the data suggests that Internet users'  
feelings of intimacy, timelessness and lack of inhibition all 
contribute to the addictive force of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a power here that's different than anything we've  
dealt with before,'' said Greenfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers did caution that, while one of the best estimates  
yet, the 6 percent figure is based on a group of people who use 
only one Web site, however broadly aimed. The questionnaire also 
followed ABC news coverage on Internet addiction, so relatively 
more compulsive users might been drawn to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield, though, argued that his estimate is conservative. He  
added that, just as a drug is most addictive when absorbed directly 
into the bloodstream, the Internet's potential for abuse will grow 
with modem speeds and ease of access. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said Internet addiction will ultimately be broken  
down into several categories, perhaps revolving around sex and 
relations, consumerism, gambling, stock trading, and obsessive 
Internet surfing for its own sake. 
</P>
<P>
	Therapists at the psychology meeting said they have successfully  
treated some Internet addicts, often with a mix of talking sessions 
and programs aimed more narrowly at reducing a sharply defined set 
of behaviors.

<HEADLINE> Steelers' Center, Dawson, Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- All-Pro center Dermontti Dawson returned from  
a three-week injury layoff Monday as the Pittsburgh Steelers worked 
out for the first time on their new in-town practice fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerome Bettis may not be far behind, either.  
</P>
<P>
	Bettis, who said last week he wasn't 100 percent certain if he  
would be ready to start at running back in the Sept. 12 opener in 
Cleveland, discarded his left knee brace to take part in running 
drills. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson and Bettis injured their left knees only two days apart  
shortly after the Steelers opened camp July 29, and neither 
practiced until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Cowher said Bettis might resume full-scale practicing  
later this week as the Steelers prepare for Saturday night's home 
exhibition game against the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis isn't quite as far along as Dawson after needing two  
arthroscopic knee operations since the 1998 season, including an 
Aug. 2 procedure to repair torn cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the hardest he has run so far and he told me he felt  
great,'' Cowher said. ``He said the knee feels stable. He'll keep 
picking it up and we'll see how it responds each day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis isn't ready yet to set a return date, but is much more  
optimistic now that he can play in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson sprained his left knee in practice July 31, and has been  
so bored since that he snapped the ball without a helmet in 
non-contact drills against the Washington Redskins two weeks ago. 
He has never missed a game during his 11-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to find out where I am is to go all out,'' said  
Dawson, an All-Pro the last five seasons. ``I know what to do to 
get ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher didn't notice anything wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dermontti got through practice real well,'' Cowher said. ``He  
didn't have any setbacks at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Carlos Emmons sat out practice with a hamstring  
injury, while tight end Harold Bettis apparently will undergo 
arthroscopic knee surgery Wednesday. He had ice on both knees 
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Art Dealer Leo Castelli Dead at 91 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anyone can discover an artist, Leo Castelli once  
said, ``but to make him what he is, give him importance, that's 
really discovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To the many American contemporary masters he promoted, Castelli,  
who died Sunday at age 91, was the quintessence of that vision -- an 
art dealer with an independent eye and a mind to match. 
</P>
<P>
	In fostering the careers of such painters as Robert Rauschenberg  
and Jasper Johns, admirers say he brought an energy and 
congeniality to the landscape of modern art he helped define. 
</P>
<P>
	Castelli died at his home on Manhattan's Upper East Side  
following a short illness, said Amy Poll, a family spokeswoman. A 
private service was held early Sunday evening at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Rauschenberg and Johns, Castelli's stable  
included Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, James 
Rosenquist, Robert Morris, Ellsworth Kelly, Kenneth Noland, Cy 
Twombly, Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Bruce Nauman, Richard Serra and 
Andy Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first saw the work of Johns and Stella, I was bowled  
over,'' Castelli said in 1984. ``I just feel sheer, pure 
enthusiasm. And then you get feedback from a mysterious consensus 
out there that you are right. Then, of course, you intensify your 
push and drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though some of his most famous artists defected to other dealers  
during the churning 1980s, Castelli's New York galleries were hot 
houses for major talents in the schools and styles that arose in 
post-war America and made New York the center of contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in the forefront in promoting the successors to abstract  
expressionism -- pop artists, minimalists and conceptualists. Author 
Danielle Gardner titled him ``a modern Medici, the man who sold 
Europe on contemporary American art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castelli's eye for what would sell brought his galleries  
millions of dollars worth of sales yearly, but Castelli put much of 
it back to nurture artists who had not yet found a market. 
</P>
<P>
	During his rise to pre-eminence among dealers in the 1960s, he  
told an interviewer that he only followed where art led, not vice 
versa. ``One has to accept what painters do. One does not have to 
like it, but one cannot discard it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Serra once recalled that when Castelli discovered him in 1963,  
the dealer guaranteed him monthly payments for three years without 
expectation of selling any of his sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like getting a Rockefeller grant,'' Serra said. ``Leo  
has always been generous, supportive, intimate and friendly, a 
throwback to another century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been learning from exhibitions at his gallery -- and from  
him -- for 30 years,'' Nan Rosenthal, 20th-Century curator of the 
National Gallery in Washington, said a few years ago. ``It's Leo's 
intelligence, and his loyalty to his artists, that makes him so 
extraordinary. It's not been about the business, but a passion for 
the art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times in the mid-'60s when you felt that if you  
didn't get to Leo's every other day, you were going to miss out on 
something,'' collector Victor Ganz once told an interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
	Castelli was born in Trieste in 1907 of well-to-do, socially  
prominent parents. He was educated in Milan and dabbled in the 
insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
	His marriage in 1933 to Ileana Schapira, daughter of a wealthy  
Romanian industrialist, led to a job in Paris and indulgence in the 
couple's interest in modern art. 
</P>
<P>
	Castelli opened a gallery in Paris with Rene Drouin, an  
architect and designer. Their first and only show, a surrealist 
exhibit, in 1939, was a success. Then World War II erupted and 
Castelli, a Jew, made his way to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving with U.S. Army intelligence, and receiving  
American citizenship as a consequence, Castelli tried his hand in a 
sweater manufacturing business set up by his father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pull of art led him from collecting to promoting and he  
helped finance the landmark Ninth Street Show of 1951, an exhibit 
of 61 abstract expressionists. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, at age 50, he and his wife opened a small gallery in  
their townhouse home on East 77th Street and began looking for 
artists headed in new directions. Johns, Rauschenberg and Stella 
were among his early stars. 
</P>
<P>
	He also arranged European exposure for his artists, an effort  
crowned in 1964 when Rauschenberg became the first American to win 
the grand prize of the Venice Biennale. 
</P>
<P>
	Castelli and Ileana divorced in 1960 and he married Antoinette  
Fraissex du Bost in 1963. The second Mrs. Castelli died in 1987. He 
married Barbara Bertozzi in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Castelli had a daughter, Nina Sundell, from the first marriage  
and a son, Jean-Cristophe, from the second.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plays Sax at Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- There just happened to be a spare  
saxophone on the bandstand, so the president grabbed it and plunged 
into a jazzy rendition of ``My Funny Valentine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scene, with a relaxed Bill Clinton providing the solo for a  
couple celebrating their wedding anniversary at a political 
fund-raiser for his wife, Hillary, would have been unthinkable at 
presidential vacation time a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the president avoided his favorite vacation activity:  
golf. But today, Clinton donned a blue shirt and khaki shorts, then 
headed for Farm Neck Golf Club with a foursome that included Sen. 
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., Boston businessman Thomas Lee and New 
York investment banker Matt Gohd. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spent about 10 minutes at the driving range, then took  
his first tee shot. ``Aw, I killed it. I came over. I need help,'' 
Clinton said. Without asking his partners, he dropped another ball 
on the tee to take a mulligan, or repeat shot; That ball followed 
the path of the first. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aw, I did it again,'' the president said. He pointed to the  
adjacent tee and said, ``I should have teed up over there.'' He 
drove Lee away in the cart. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Clinton seems to be having a happier vacation this year  
than he did last year, amid the immediate aftermath of the 
president's speech to the nation acknowledging he hadn't told the 
truth about his relationship with former White House intern Monica 
Lewinsky. There were demands for more complete apologies. The 
tension between the president and the first lady was clear. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, those clouds appeared to have parted even though the  
actual weather on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard was 
cool and overcast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons greeted a crowd of 250 people gathered at the  
Edgartown home of Viacom executive Frank Biondi and his wife, 
Carol, to pledge support and money for Mrs. Clinton if she makes 
her expected run for the Senate seat from New York being vacated by 
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons passed up church services in anticipation of the  
late-morning political brunch, which raised $1,000 per ticket for 
the first lady's potential political future. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton spoke, but the president did not.  
</P>
<P>
	However, Clinton, who has never entirely gotten over his days as  
a high school band member in Arkansas, honored a request by an 
unidentified couple celebrating their 35th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	He picked up a saxophone and joined Resonance, a high school  
jazz band providing the entertainment, to play the requested song, 
``My Funny Valentine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guest list numbered some of the Vineyard summer residents  
that the White House staff refers to as ``the usual cast of 
characters.'' They included Clinton friends Vernon Jordan, Steven 
Rattner, Dick Ebersol and Maurice Tempelsman. Also attending were 
humor columnist Art Buchwald, lawyer Alan Dershowitz and Mrs. 
Clinton's former spokeswoman, Lisa Caputo. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, the Clintons journeyed to a restaurant in nearby Oak  
Bluffs to a birthday celebration for longtime aide Kelly Craighead. 
On Sunday evening they went out to dinner with another set of 
friends.

<HEADLINE> Badgers Frosh Charged With Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin freshman fullback Jael Speights  
was charged Monday with two counts of second-degree sexual assault 
and one count of burglary, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speights, 18, of Zion, Ill., was arrested Friday at the football  
team's practice facility for allegedly entering a woman's apartment 
on July 31 and assaulting her, police said. He was being held on 
$15,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Speights was suspended from the Wisconsin football team  
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suspension is the result of an incident that is alleged to  
have occurred prior to training camp,'' Badgers coach Barry Alvarez 
said in a statement. ``Speights will not be allowed to rejoin the 
team until his legal matter is resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Police spokesman Dave Gouran said Speights apparently  
did not know the woman. Gouran did not know how Speights was 
identified as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Speights rushed for 746 yards and seven touchdowns as a senior  
at Zion-Benton High School in Zion, Ill.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `In Too Deep' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	From its grainy, unfocused opening sequence, it's clear that  
nothing about ``In Too Deep'' will be clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Not the characters -- they fluctuate from flashes of raging  
sadism to tender charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly not the story -- it meanders from one violent scene to  
the next before arriving at its startling climax. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing's for sure: ``In Too Deep'' is an extremely raw,  
disturbing film which sometimes goes over the top in its brutality. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar Epps plays Jeff Cole, a cocky young narcotics officer for  
the Cincinnati Police Department. Jeff goes undercover to bring 
down a drug lord nicknamed God (L.L. Cool J). No cop has been able 
to penetrate God's operation, based in the projects, but Jeff is 
sure he can. After all, he grew up in the projects. Plus, he has 
boundless faith in his abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	In his undercover persona of J. Reid, Jeff gets sucked into  
God's world. He hangs out with God's deputies, befriends them, 
becomes one of them. Soon he loses sight of the man he used to be 
and is torn between answering to his lieutenant (Stanley Tucci) and 
his new boss. 
</P>
<P>
	He also struggles to balance his police work with his other  
passion, a beautiful, sweet dancer named Myra (Nia Long) with whom 
he could find true happiness for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything in Jeff's world is a contradiction.  
</P>
<P>
	God dominates the projects through his drug cartel, yet he drops  
a ton of cash each year on a Thanksgiving dinner for poor people. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug dealers coldly engage in illegal, immoral activity, but  
many are married with children and they're steadfastly loyal to 
each other. Several of them attend the baptism of God's infant son, 
and one serves as the godfather. As he cradles his infant son, God 
tells his friends proudly, ``He's gonna be something someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite these intriguing complexities, the story from  
screenwriters Paul Aaron and Michael Henry Brown never really hooks 
the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
	The harsh treatment of women is especially hard to watch, from  
the words the male characters use to describe them to the ease with 
which God beats a woman he thinks has stolen from him. He picks her 
up by her hair from the sidewalk as she screams and cries, then 
sticks a gun in her mouth and forces her to suck it -- all in front 
of his son, who's strapped into a car seat in God's BMW. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the performances are strong, especially Epps' as the man  
caught in the middle. He shows a wide range of emotions as his two 
worlds tug at him. He's brazen and rebellious at times, scared and 
tormented at others. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucci, as a stable, soft-spoken voice of reason, again displays  
his range. We saw this spring as a wily Puck in ``William 
Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' last year as 
``Winchell,'' for which he won a Golden Globe, and in 1996 as a 
high-strung Italian restaurant owner in ``Big Night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	L.L. Cool J never truly embodies his character's villainy,  
though. Even at his cruelest moments, he still comes off as a nice 
guy -- his sweet baby face betrays him. 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Grier as a member of the undercover detective team is one of  
the few strong female characters in the film, and her presence 
provides an element of peace. But her time on screen is way too 
short. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Rymer's direction often relies on quick pans and extreme  
close-ups of faces, guns and knives, providing an engrossing 
tension, enhanced by the thumping based of gangsta rap in nearly 
every scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The lighting also enhances the film's moods. Epps and Long sit  
before a fireplace during a quiet talk, and its golden glow warms 
them. Later, bright white headlights splash across Epps' face 
before he enters a drug bust in the film's climax. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Too Deep,'' a Miramax release, is rated R for strong  
language, violence and drug use. Running time: 105 minutes.

	Dow Soars 199.15 to Record Close  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared today, pushing the Dow Jones  
average to record heights on the eve of a meeting at which the 
Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates again. 
The Dow climbed 199.15 points to close at 11,299.76. That was well 
above its July 16 record close of 11,209.84 and brought its gains 
so far this year to 23 percent. On the NYSE, advancers led 
decliners 1,715-1,255. The Nasdaq was up 71.24 at 2,719.57.

	Foreign Rescue Teams Leaving Turkey  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Foreign rescue teams packed up their  
listening equipment and caged their dogs today, pulling out of 
Turkey as the relief effort switched from finding earthquake 
survivors to aiding those already out of the rubble. But some 
amazing discoveries continued to emerge, including a 4-year-old boy 
found alive after six days under the debris. But recognizing the 
near-impossible odds of finding more survivors, rescue efforts were 
changing focus to concentrate on helping the estimated 200,000 
homeless.

	Gaza 'Safe Passage' Deal Struck  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian negotiators struck a deal with  
Israel today to fulfill two key symbols of Palestinian sovereignty, 
but warned of deadlock on major issues. Under the agreement, 
Palestinians will be able to move more freely between the Gaza 
Strip and the West Bank starting in October, when work on a port in 
Gaza City will also begin, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat 
said in an interview. Erekat emphasized, however, that there can be 
no real progress without agreement on the release of Palestinian 
prisoners and a timetable for an Israeli withdrawal from parts of 
the West Bank.

	BEIJING (AP) -- South Korea's defense minister tried to enlist  
China's help today to persuade Chinese ally North Korea from 
testing a new long-range missile. Talks between South Korea's Cho 
Sung-tae and China's Chi Haotian were the first ever between 
defense ministers of the two countries, adversaries in the 1950-53 
Korean War. The South Korean also met with ministers in Japan in 
hopes of resolving the crisis over the missile, which is capable of 
reaching the United States.

	U.N.: Congo Ordered 250 Executed  
</P>
<P>
	KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- A special military tribunal set up by  
President Laurent Kabila has ordered more than 200 people executed, 
a U.N. official said today. Congo's Military Court of Order has 
ordered the execution of 250 people over the past two years for 
crimes against Kabila's government, according to Frej Fenniche, 
director of the U.N. human rights agency in the capital, Kinshasa. 
Those executed included both soldiers and civilians. Fenniche 
called the figures ``worrying'' and said the government should 
abolish the court.

	PCP, Cocaine Vaccination Eyed  
</P>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Designer antibodies may someday be used to  
immunize people against cocaine and other drugs to block the rush 
that users crave. If these vaccines fulfill their promise, they 
could revolutionize emergency treatment for PCP and amphetamines. 
And though they won't cure addiction, they could also help people 
who want to kick the habit, researchers say. Illegal drugs all have 
molecules so tiny they sneak unnoticed through the body's immune 
system. To create antibodies, researchers must hook the molecule to 
a protein big enough to set off the immune system's alarms.

	Man Gets 3 Days for Cursing  
</P>
<P>
	STANDISH, Mich. (AP) -- The ``cursing canoeist'' was ordered  
today to perform four days of community service and either pay a 
$75 fine or spend three days in jail. Timothy Boomer, 25, let loose 
with a stream of a profanities after falling out of a canoe last 
summer. A jury convicted him in June of violating an 1897 Michigan 
law against cursing in front of children. District Judge Allen 
Yenior put the sentence on hold while he appeals his conviction. 
Boomer said that if his conviction if upheld, he will pay the fine 
rather than go to jail.

authorize a strike -- if necessary -- against Ford Motor Co. The UAW

Aug. 17, with 96.4 percent in favor. The votes are held every three

	Jones Comes Up Short in Long Jump  
</P>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Marion Jones' bid for a record four gold  
medals ended tonight in the long jump at the World Championships. 
Jones, who won the 100 meters last night, managed a best jump of 
only 22 feet, 5 inches and settled for the bronze. The gold medal 
went to Spain's Niurka Montalvo, who jumped 23-2. Fiona May of 
Italy won the silver with a jump of 22-9 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 105.43 in Morning Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today, with technology shares  
showing surprising strength a day before the Federal Reserve was to 
announce whether it will raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In late-morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 105.43 at 11,206.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 13.44 at 1,350.05, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 39.08 at 2,687.41. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's Open Market Committee meets Tuesday, and most  
economists predict the central bank will raise short-term interest 
rates a quarter-percentage point. Since higher interest rates can 
cut into corporate profits, stocks have faltered since the Fed 
first raised the possibility of a rate increase in July. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent sessions, however, stocks have edged back toward  
record highs as the market absorbed the likelihood of higher rates. 
This morning, the Dow briefly traded above its July 16 record close 
of 11,209.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks are also benefiting from a growing belief that the Fed  
may limit its action to one modest increase on Tuesday. In its bid 
to keep inflation from accelerating, the Fed also raised rates on 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, we expect a very solid summer rally based on very  
positive earnings reports and growing investor confidence that 
future Fed hikes will likely be moderate,'' said John H. 
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were buoying the Nasdaq. Amazon.com was up 5  
11/16 to 119 1/8, and Yahoo rose 5 3/4 to 150 3/4. Many of those stocks have 
been driven down by concerns over interest rates as their high 
prices and often meager earnings drove investors in search of more 
guaranteed investments. 
</P>
<P>
	United Water Resources rose 2 to 33 1/16 after French utility  
Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, launched a $35-per-share bid to acquire 
full ownership of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 198.62 million 
shares, behind Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, measuring the performance of smaller  
companies, rose 2.21 to 436.59.

<HEADLINE> Gailey's Absence Miffs Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys coach Chan Gailey is  
tired of asking ``Where's Warren?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Chris Warren, who left training camp early last  
week after asking permission to visit a groin specialist he's been 
working with in Colorado, was supposed to back a few days later 
then a schedule change allowed him to be out until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But a morning meeting and afternoon practice passed without  
Warren arriving. He was expected back late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The look on Gailey's face and the tone of his voice when  
discussing the matter made it obvious this wasn't an excused 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey indicated Warren would be fined for his tardiness, but  
the coach refused to give any details about the situation. He 
answered four straight questions by saying, ``I'll talk to him 
tonight when he gets here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warren's agent, Rick Schaeffer, said the whole situation is a  
simple misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone has to say they accept responsibility, Chris is  
willing to do that,'' Schaeffer said. ``The Cowboys did nothing 
wrong. Their expectations were certainly reasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warren was originally expected back Thursday night in time for a  
Friday morning walk-through, but Gailey allowed players to go home 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren didn't have to travel to New England for an exhibition  
game Saturday night because he wasn't going to play. All players 
had Sunday off, then were expected back at Midwestern State 
University by 10 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should've checked in and didn't,'' Schaeffer said. ``It  
could've been solved with a phone call and the call wasn't made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The groin problem kept Warren out of seven full games last  
season and parts of several more. Early in camp, he said he wasn't 
completely healed until this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	When Warren left for further treatment, it surprised Gailey  
because the running back never told him of any setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren has been working with Dr. Michael Leahy of Colorado  
Springs, a chiropractor who helps many many pro athletes overcome 
groin problems through a technique he developed and patented.

<HEADLINE>  Bret Downgraded to Tropical Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVIERA, Texas (AP) -- A blustery shadow of its former self,  
Hurricane Bret was downgraded to a tropical storm today as it 
plodded across a sparsely populated swath of southern Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm, the biggest hurricane to strike Texas in nearly 20  
years, continued to drench the region with thunderous squalls 
today, but no injuries were reported since Bret made landfall about 
6 p.m. Sunday in sparsely populated Kenedy County. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like a big jet engine was coming down on top of us.  
It was very scary,'' Jesse Salinas said in Sarita, the only town in 
Kenedy County. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little structural damage in Sarita, a town of 460  
people, but power lines and trees were down, including several 
large trees around the courthouse square. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 25 inches of rain fell by early today on the coastal  
plains of sparsely settled Kenedy County, where the average 
rainfall for a whole year is 29.7 inches, the National Weather 
Service said. Rain continued falling elsewhere and there was a 
chance of flooding in places plus isolated tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage was substantial in Falfurrias, about 60 miles southwest  
of Corpus Christi, Mayor Michael Guerra said. 
</P>
<P>
	The eye passed over the town of about 5,800 residents about 3  
a.m., ripping roofs from homes and businesses, he said. Up to 90 
percent of the town had no electricity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of debris and live power lines in the roads, and  
we've had four convenience stores lose the canopies from their gas 
pumps. And some of the less-structurally sound buildings have lost 
roofs and windows,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Power outages also were reported from the state's southern tip  
near Brownsville and McAllen to the counties surrounding Corpus 
Christi, said Jessica Mahaffey, spokeswoman for Central Power and 
Light Co. in Corpus Christi. The company serves much of South 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winds are still howling out there,'' Ms. Mahaffey said.  
Repair crews have been working as wind conditions permit, and would 
be joined by others today, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers from federal and state agencies gathered this morning to  
move into the storm-blown areas to assess the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	As of 11 a.m. EDT today, Bret had top sustained wind of 45 mph  
and some higher gusts, the National Hurricane Center said. The 
minimum for a hurricane is 74 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Bret had been rated a Category 4 storm when it approached over  
the Gulf of Mexico with 140 mph wind, piling waves 26 feet high at 
one offshore weather buoy, but made landfall with wind down to 125 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, the center of Bret moved across rural southern  
Texas, going west-northwest at 6 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	It was expected to turn westward toward Mexico, where more than  
3,500 people living near the Rio Grande in Nuevo Laredo, just 
across the border from Laredo, Texas, had been evacuated because of 
the possibility of flooding, the government news agency Notimex 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Bret unleashed its power on the deserted Padre Island  
National Seashore, 70 miles south of Corpus Christi, before 
continuing into desolate, sparsely populated ranch land. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of residents from Brownsville to Corpus Christi had  
fled north and west as the hurricane approached. Windows throughout 
the region were taped and boarded in anticipation of the worst 
storm since Hurricane Allen, another Category 4 storm that struck 
roughly the same area in 1980, causing $55 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was overpublicized,'' said Ralph Huff, who defied  
conventional wisdom -- and an evacuation order -- and stayed in his 
cinder block home overlooking Baffin Bay, just east of this small 
agricultural town. His phone and power were still working late 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the storm's center passed less than 10 miles to the  
south, ``there wasn't even any storm surge,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 125 mph wind, with gusts blowing even higher, extended 40  
miles out from the storm when it first hit land. Forecasters feared 
possible tornadoes, a foot or more of rain and a storm surge that 
could approach 10 to 15 feet as it moved over land. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton issued a major disaster declaration Sunday  
night for seven counties, freeing funds to help local governments 
with emergency supplies and debris removal, said FEMA Director 
James Lee Witt. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas hadn't been hit by a hurricane since Hurricane Jerry  
killed three people in October 1989. However, the state's 
367-mile-long coast has been struck by tropical storms since then, 
including Charley, which dumped 18 inches of rain and killed 19 
people after it moved inland in August 1998.

<HEADLINE> Liver Donors Doctors Face Dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Bruce and Kristina Winger spent weeks  
agonizing over the decision: Should she risk her life to donate 
half her liver in hopes of saving her dying husband? 
</P>
<P>
	The Wingers had a baby boy to think of. The couple from  
Richmond, Va., last year decided to go through with the live liver 
donation, a controversial procedure that is becoming increasingly 
common. Both have recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Winger said his wife saved his life -- but the decision wasn't  
easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a 14-month old son,'' he said. ``It kind of weighs  
heavy on you. What would he do if both of us weren't around?'' 
</P>
<P>
	People cannot live without a liver. Doctors can now remove  
portions of healthy livers and put them into patients dying from 
liver failure. 
</P>
<P>
	The livers can grow to full size in a matter of weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that the new liver doesn't always save the  
recipient, and donors' risks of dying are estimated at one in 20, 
or about 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors meeting in Pittsburgh this week are examining the ethics  
of the procedure. They worry about putting healthy donors at risk 
and putting them in the awkward position of having to decide 
whether to risk their lives for loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've almost got a situation where it's hard to say no,  
especially if it's a relative,'' said Dr. Arthur Caplan, director 
of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania 
Health System. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,000 people die each year waiting for transplants, and  
about 62,000 are waiting at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
	Until 10 years ago, doctors could only use livers from the  
deceased for transplants. But a long waiting list -- and more 
hepatitis C cases causing more people to suffer liver failure -- has 
led a growing number of doctors to try live transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	Approximately 77 percent of recipients survive with the new  
livers, and in 223 U.S. cases since 1997, no donor has died 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some hospitals will not touch the procedure, including  
the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, historically among the 
leaders in liver transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery was most common with parents donating livers to  
their children, but doctors are making more transplants between 
adults. That is riskier because it requires about half of the liver 
to be removed, and forces doctors to cut closer to vital veins and 
arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	There is often no other way to get healthy livers, said Dr.  
Amadeo Marcos, director of the Living Donor Liver Program at the 
Medical College of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no options here,'' said Marcos, who blames hepatitis  
C for a recent 40 percent drop in the number of cadaver livers 
available in his region. ``We had to cover this decrease with the 
living donors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Marcos who told the Wingers about the option.  
</P>
<P>
	Winger, 31, had primary sclerosing cholangitis, which blocks the  
bile ducts and leads to cirrhosis. The disease -- the same one that 
National Football League Hall of Fame running back Walter Payton 
has -- is marked by fatigue, followed by yellow in the pigment of 
the eyes and skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say many patients with the condition survive only about  
two years without a transplant. The cause of the disease is not 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	Winger had been on a donor waiting list for nine months and  
believed he was going to die soon. But he and his wife took weeks 
to decide. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said the decision is also a difficult one for  
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Many hospitals require counseling to make sure donors are not  
being pressured, said Dr. Jorge Reyes, director of pediatric 
transplantation at Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been some debate as to whether there's emotional  
coercion,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Wants N. Korea Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. special envoy has established a working  
relationship with North Korean officials, but the State Department 
hasn't yet arranged a visit by a top leader of the communist 
regime, a spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Defense Secretary William Perry issued an invitation to  
Washington three months ago during his trip to North Korea. As 
special envoy, Perry is evaluating U.S. policy towards North Korea 
for the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit, which would be the first by a top North Korean  
government official, has not been scheduled, said State Department 
spokesman James Foley. 
</P>
<P>
	But Perry's visit accomplished one of its key aims -- ``to  
establish a working relationship with senior officials, who report 
directly to leader Kim Jong Il,'' Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was believed that there would be continuing value in  
high-level dialogue that was begun in Pyongyang,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley did not identify the official who was invited, but said  
the invitee was the ``key interlocutor'' with Perry during his 
visit in May. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean officials said the North Korean is Deputy Foreign  
Minister Kang Sok Ju, who is regarded as a close confidant of Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry is to meet Aug. 27 in San Francisco with South Korea's  
unification minister, Lim Dong-won, who left Seoul Monday for a 
weeklong U.S. visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this week, Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, is making his fifth  
trip in five years to North Korea. Hall said last week his trip is 
primarily humanitarian but he hopes to encourage Pyongyang 
officials to abandon efforts to test a ballistic missile. 
</P>
<P>
	An official of the North Korean Foreign Ministry said last week  
that his country is ready for negotiations over its reported plans 
for the second test-launch of a long-range missile. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, formed their own team  
Monday to examine ``the North Korea problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team made up mostly of House committee leaders is to begin  
its review next month when Congress returns from its summer 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House  
International Relations Committee, is heading the Republican 
review. He said the group would focus on ``the threat North Korea 
poses to the United States and our friends and allies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Sam Gejdenson of  
Connecticut, said it was ``simply outrageous'' that Democrats had 
been excluded from the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather than seek a sensible, bipartisan solution, the  
Republican leadership is making an attempt to embarrass the 
administration. But by excluding the other side of the aisle they 
are only making an embarrassment of the process,'' Gejdenson added 
in a statement.

	Rescue Teams Leave Turkey  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Foreign rescue teams pulled out of  
Turkey today as the relief effort switched from finding earthquake 
survivors to aiding those already out of the rubble. Some foreign 
rescue workers claimed Turkish authorities were pressuring them to 
leave. ``(They) say the rescue operation is finished and the 
buildings must be cleared,'' said one Swiss team member, Rafael 
Estefan. Government officials denied making any such demand. 
German, Japanese and Austrian rescue teams returned home today and 
some British rescuers left yesterday, the Anatolia news agency 
reported.

	Schroeder Moves Into Berlin Office  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Wearing the scars of Nazi terror and East German  
communism, Berlin reclaimed its place as Germany's center of power 
today with the arrival of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. Ten years 
after the fall of the Berlin Wall first opened the vista of a 
united Germany, the chancellor moved without pomp into his new 
office in the heart of the metropolis that is taking over from the 
sleepy former West German capital of Bonn. Since Schroeder's 
election last fall, he has been eager to move here and shape what 
he calls the ``Berlin Republic'' -- a Germany confident in its 
democracy and less weighed down by the past.

	Angola Civil War Causes Malnutrition  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Civil war in Angola has created intense  
levels of misery with some 200 people dying a day as a result of 
growing malnutrition, the head of the U.N. World Food Program said 
today. Angolans have become so desperate to survive they are even 
risking death to collect sticks used to mark mine fields, which are 
then used as cooking fuel, said WFP executive director Catherine 
Bertini. Fighting between the government and UNITA rebels resumed 
in December, breaking a 1994 U.N.-brokered peace accord.

	U.N. To Mull Iraq Oil Export Cap  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- If current oil prices hold, Iraq could  
wind up exporting $1 billion more oil than allowed to under the 
U.N. rules, officials said today. The Security Council will soon 
have to consider raising the monetary ceiling on Baghdad's oil 
exports. If it does, Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended that 
any surplus income be used to improve the health and nutrition of 
Iraq's children. U.N. economic sanctions, imposed after Iraq 
invaded Kuwait in 1990, prevent Iraq from selling oil outside the 
humanitarian program.

	Bennett Apologizes to Black Leaders  
</P>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, apologized  
privately today to civil rights leaders for making what they called 
an insulting remark about black women. Utah leaders for the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People urged 
Bennett to issue a public apology. Bennett was criticized for 
saying Texas Gov. George W. Bush will win the Republican 
presidential nomination ``unless some woman comes forward, let's 
say some black woman comes forward with an illegitimate child that 
he fathered.'' Bennett had said he regretted making the ``clumsy'' 
remark to the editorial board of the Standard-Examiner newspaper in 
Ogden.

	Rules Tightened for Fund Managers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have tightened the rules  
governing personal trading by mutual fund managers and employees, 
in the wake of several cases of fund managers accused of improperly 
enriching themselves with investors' money. The Securities and 
Exchange Commission today announced the move, which it has been 
considering for at least a year. The changes adopted by the SEC 
give boards of mutual fund companies more supervision over personal 
trading by managers and employees and require fuller disclosure of 
such trading. The changes are designed to avoid conflicts of 
interest that can arise when mutual fund managers and employees buy 
and sell securities for their own accounts.

the Dow climbed 199.15 points to close at 11,299.76.

	Selig: Rose May Go to World Series  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ten years after Pete Rose agreed to his lifetime  
ban from baseball, commissioner Bud Selig said the sport's career 
hits leader would be invited to the World Series if he's elected to 
the All-Century team. Rose was snubbed by baseball last month when 
the living players among the 100 on the All-Century ballot 
participated in an on-field ceremony before the All-Star game. Rose 
wasn't asked to a pregame luncheon with the others on the ballot. 
Fans vote for the top 25 players, and the team will be announced 
before the World Series opener Oct. 23.

<HEADLINE>  Jones Comes Up Short in Long Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- There'll be no four gold medals for Marion  
Jones ... not this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Her ambitious plans at the World Championships were shattered  
Monday night when she finished third in a long jump competition 
that ended with a controversy that gave host Spain its first gold 
medal by a woman ever in the Olympics or World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no excuses,'' Jones said after losing for the third  
consecutive time in her weakest event. ``I wanted to come here and 
do every event I was entered in. It didn't happen today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I set my goals very high. Of course I'm disappointed. I need  
to go back to the drawing board and get ready for next year. I need 
to work on my technique. My specialty is running. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can't understand that when I'm entered in four events  
I'm not going to say I'm going to win three golds and a bronze.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, with a career-best 23 feet, 11 3/4 inches in the long jump,  
never got untracked this time. Her best effort was 1 1/2 feet short of 
that -- 22-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, Jones has even higher expectations. She already has  
said her intention is to win five golds at the Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	She already has won one gold, in the 100 meters, at the  
championships and still can get two more, in the 200 and a relay. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jones retained her composure, Italy's Fiona May did not.  
</P>
<P>
	May, the 1995 world champion, was leading until the next-to-last  
jump. Then Spain's Niurka Montalvo soared 23-2, a career-best, but 
her toe appeared to be past the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials ruled it a fair jump for the Cuban-born Montalvo, who  
became a Spanish citizen May 5, as the crowd of 37,815 roared in 
approval. May had the final jump and couldn't match that distance, 
giving her the silver at 22-9 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	After the competition, May congratulated Montalvo with a kiss on  
the cheek, then poured out her anger and her emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the jump, it was a foul,'' the distraught May said with  
tears welling in her eyes. ``I don't want to be unsportsmanlike, 
but everybody saw it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if she felt she was robbed, the bitter May nodded her head  
affirmatively. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians quickly protested. More than an hour after the  
competition, a six-member Jury of Appeal rejected the appeal ``on 
the grounds that the jump was OK,'' International Amateur Athletic 
Federation spokesman Giorgio Reineri said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No mark (on the plastecine), no foul,'' Reineri added.  
</P>
<P>
	This was the third consecutive World Championships that the  
women's long jump was decided in the final stages, and each time 
May was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, she beat Montalvo with her final attempt.  
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago at Athens, May, in third place, was called for a  
foul on her sixth try that appeared to be the winner. Before the 
jump, the Greek crowd was whistling to distract her because a Greek 
was in second place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why was it irregular?'' Montalvo said of her controversial  
jump Monday. ``One must know how to lose. I knew I had to jump 7 
meters (22-11 3/4) to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't heard the Spanish anthem. I'm sure it will be  
emotional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because the event ended so late and the winner was decided long  
afterward, the awards ceremony, containing the anthem, was 
postponed until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She won on the last jump in 1995 and I'm paying her back  
now,'' Montalvo said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's other finals, Kenya's Christopher Koskei won the  
3,000 steeplechase in 8 minutes, 11.76 seconds, as world 
record-holder Bernard Bermasai, also of Kenya, finished fifth; 
Russia's Vyacheslav Voronin won the men's high jump at 7-9 1/4, a 
career best and the best in the world for 1999; and Franka Dietzsch 
of Germany took the women's discus at 223-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskei, under investigation by track and field's world governing  
body for apparently allowing Bermasai to win the recent Golden 
League meet at Zurich, Switzerland, came off the final bend to lead 
a 1-2 Kenyan finish. Koskei swept to the front so quickly that with 
about 10 meters remaining he was able to glance at the crowd over 
his right shoulder and twirl his right index finger into the air 
indicating victory, Kenya's fifth straight at the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson Boit Kipketer, the 1997 champion, was second in 8:12.09,  
and Barmasai was timed in 8:13.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Voronin didn't miss in the high jump until failing three times  
at a meet-record 7-10 1/2. Canada's Mark Boswell, the NCAA indoor and 
outdoor champion for Texas, finished a surprising second at 7-8 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Austin, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, cleared only 7-6  
and was tied for eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Mark Crear, the U.S. champion and the only 110-meter  
hurdler under 13.00 this year, was disqualified in the 
quarterfinals after false-starting twice. The U.S. team protested, 
claiming that one false start should have been charged to Florian 
Schwarthoff of Germany. The protest was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Johnson, the two-time defending hurdles champion and 1996  
Olympic gold medalist, advanced to the semifinals, but looked rusty 
after a six-week layoff. Britain's Colin Jackson, the world 
record-holder, also reached the semifinals by winning his two 
first-round heats. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Johnson, the three-time defending champion in the 400,  
reached the semifinals by winning his quarterfinal heat in 45.10.

<HEADLINE> Tanker Crashes Killing One in Ore. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAPLETON, Ore. (AP) -- A tanker truck hit a pickup and plunged  
off a winding highway near the central Oregon Coast today, killing 
one person and spilling thousands of gallons of gasoline near a 
creek that is home to threatened salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the truck escaped serious injury in the accident,  
which happened at 5:30 a.m. on State Highway 126 five miles east of 
this western Oregon town. 
</P>
<P>
	A passenger in the pickup was killed. State Police spokesman Lt.  
Gregg Hastings said deputies searched the underbrush at the scene 
for anyone else who may have been thrown from the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The tanker truck held 11,000 gallons of gasoline, but had  
spilled only 2,800 gallons. The fuel saturated the ground about 100 
feet from the creek, said Jennifer Boudin, spokeswoman for the 
Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck operator, Ron's Oil of Coquille, hired a cleanup crew  
to remove the remaining gasoline from the tanker truck as well as 
the contaminated dirt, to prevent gasoline from reaching the creek, 
Boudin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Upstream from the spill, Knowles Creek has been the site of  
innovative efforts to restore spawning and rearing habitat for 
threatened coho salmon runs heavily damaged by logging. 
</P>
<P>
	Downstream from the wreck, gasoline could kill juvenile coho and  
chinook salmon, steelhead and sea-run cutthroat trout living in 
deep pools, said David Bayles, conservation director of the Pacific 
Rivers Council. The coho are listed as a threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no big spawning adults in the river but that does not  
mean it could not be a disaster, he said. ``It is the little guys 
who are more vulnerable. And it is the little guys who are in there 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The council has been restoring habitat in the creek in  
partnership with the Siuslaw National Forest and Hancock Timber 
Resources Group, which owns the land the creek runs through. It has 
been part of statewide efforts to save salmon runs from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	The highway, the major route between Eugene and the coast, was  
closed because of the accident.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Industry Survives Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IZMIT, Turkey (AP) -- The car-repair shop where Cihan Cakiroglu  
worked is twisted wreckage, his boss is dead, and the August 
paycheck thatis now homeless family needs will never come. 
</P>
<P>
	At the nearby Goodyear tire plant, the blue steel walls still  
stand, but most of the employees are too busy searching for 
relatives or shelter for their families to show up for work. 
</P>
<P>
	Turks nationwide are struggling to recover from the massive,  
7.4-magnitude earthquake that struck the country's industrial 
heartland early Tuesday. The social and economic costs appear to be 
staggering. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of homeless people like Cakiroglu are demanding that  
the government help them buy new homes and furniture and find them 
new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say each day remaining factories like the Goodyear plant  
remain idle leads to a loss of $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, already struggling to cut back a federal budget  
deficit, is strapped for the cash needed to repair basic 
infrastructure, including roads, bridges and electrical lines. And 
the area hit provides almost half the tax revenue, meaning the 
government will have even less income to count on. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost to the economy could top $20 billion -- 10 percent of  
the country's gross national product and enough to drag the country 
back into recession, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Government spokesman Sukru Sina Gurel said the economic damage  
to the country could ``be beyond what any tragic event in the 
history of Turkey has caused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulent Akgerman, head of the Aegean Young Businessmen  
Association, has suggested a six-day work week to overcome the 
impact of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Other industrialists are demanding aid from the international  
community, which has already provided $500 million in loans and 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we will be able to deal with it smoothly if we  
receive support from international organizations,'' said Tevfik 
Aksoy, chief economist of Istanbul's Bank Ekspres. ``I seriously 
doubt that Turkey will be left alone on this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also pointed out that the crucial cement, automobile and tire  
factories that make western Turkey so important to the economy have 
been left largely undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
	They are expected to reopen soon, which will no doubt help ease  
the strain of the earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Goodyear plant in Izmit, for example, was built with steel  
walls and survived the earthquake, unlike many local homes and 
buildings made of cheap cement, said engineering manager Mehmet 
Turkel. 
</P>
<P>
	Some equipment was damaged, he said, but the plant should be  
able to reopen quickly, and its 500 employees should return to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you come here in a week, you'll see this plant running,''  
he said. ``People want it to happen.'' But the plant will wait a 
few days more for the search for survivors and possessions to end. 
Five of the plant's workers are believed to have been killed in the 
quake, and almost half have lost their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Personnel manager Harun Savas said the plant is offering tea and  
sandwiches to workers who come in to help assess damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to start a new life,'' said Savas, who pulled the  
bodies of five of his relatives from the wreckage of their homes 
and later helped bury them. 
</P>
<P>
	His house survived the earthquake, but his 12-year-old son,  
Cagdas, was too frightened to stay in Izmit and has gone with 
Savas' wife and daughter to live with relatives on the Black Sea 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the major problem will be how to get people back to  
work,'' said Haluk Tukel, the secretary-general of TUSIAD, the 
country's leading organization of industrialists. 
</P>
<P>
	But for many people, there is no longer any work to speak of.  
</P>
<P>
	In a grassy lot in front of a 50-foot pile of rubble, Cakiroglu  
stood beside his new home -- a brown blanket held up by a few sticks 
of wood. It is here that he sleeps with his wife and 3-year-old 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm willing to do anything, even sell pretzels on the  
street,'' Cakiroglu said.

<HEADLINE> Companies Team on Wireless Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucent Technologies, Nokia and 3Com are helping  
found a new industry group that will adopt standards for wireless 
computer networks and certify products that meet those standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance, WECA, hopes to  
make go-anywhere computing as commonplace as using a mobile phone 
by making it less of a gamble for consumers and network operators 
to invest in expensive wireless equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	While users of laptop computers and other portable devices can  
already dial-up to the Internet and private company networks with a 
wireless modem, the connections are often slow and unreliable from 
location to location. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry envisions a more robust, dependable link with local  
wireless networks deployed everywhere -- airports, parks, highways, 
homes -- like the cellular ``pods'' that provide continuous mobile 
phone service as a person travels. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, such ``local area networks,'' or LANs, have been  
deployed only sparingly in corporate settings such as a company 
building or campus. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a sign of things to come, the new iBook laptop from Apple  
Computer was introduced with an optional wireless transmitter that 
allows users to roam their homes or offices freely while using the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the visions of wireless in general is that you're no  
longer tied to a physical location when you want to communicate,'' 
said Craig Mathias, chairman of the Wireless LAN Research 
Laboratory at the Worcester Polytecnic Institute in Massachusetts. 
``Most people who travel with computers have to find a telephone 
that they physically plug into. It's so nice with a wireless 
network. You just turn it on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WECA, expected to be introduced Monday, will establish a test  
lab to certify the compatibility of any member's products. A seal 
of approval would be issued to reassure would-be purchasers of 
expensive wireless equipment for computers and networks. 
</P>
<P>
	WECA ``will enable true multi-vendor interoperability by  
certifying that systems from different manufacturers can be used 
within the same wireless infrastructure,'' the group said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	WECA's founding cast includes Aironet, Intersil, and Symbol  
Technologies. But the group gains immediate credibility with 
Lucent, perhaps the top name in communications technology, as well 
as a major name in mobile phones with Nokia, and in data networking 
with 3Com. 
</P>
<P>
	Conspicuously absent for now, however, are Cisco Systems and  
Nortel Networks, Lucent's two chief rivals in data networking and 
communications technology.

<P>
	``No mark (on the plastecine), no foul,'' Reineri added.  
</P>
<P>
	This was the third consecutive World Championships that the  
women's long jump was decided in the final stages, and each time 
May was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, she beat Montalvo with her final attempt.  
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago at Athens, May, in third place, was called for a  
foul on her sixth try that appeared to be the winner. Before the 
jump, the Greek crowd was whistling to distract her because a Greek 
was in second place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why was it irregular?'' Montalvo said of her controversial  
jump Monday. ``One must know how to lose. I knew I had to jump 7 
meters (22-11 3/4) to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't heard the Spanish anthem. I'm sure it will be  
emotional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because the event ended so late and the winner was decided long  
afterward, the awards ceremony, containing the anthem, was 
postponed until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She won on the last jump in 1995 and I'm paying her back  
now,'' Montalvo said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's other finals, Kenya's Christopher Koskei won the  
3,000 steeplechase in 8 minutes, 11.76 seconds, as world 
record-holder Bernard Bermasai, also of Kenya, finished fifth; 
Russia's Vyacheslav Voronin won the men's high jump at 7-9 1/4, a 
career best and the best in the world for 1999; and Franka Dietzsch 
of Germany took the women's discus at 223-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskei, under investigation by track and field's world governing  
body for apparently allowing Bermasai to win the recent Golden 
League meet at Zurich, Switzerland, came off the final bend to lead 
a 1-2 Kenyan finish. Koskei swept to the front so quickly that with 
about 10 meters remaining he was able to glance at the crowd over 
his right shoulder and twirl his right index finger into the air 
indicating victory, Kenya's fifth straight at the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson Boit Kipketer, the 1997 champion, was second in 8:12.09,  
and Barmasai was timed in 8:13.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Voronin didn't miss in the high jump until failing three times  
at a meet-record 7-10 1/2. Canada's Mark Boswell, the NCAA indoor and 
outdoor champion for Texas, finished a surprising second at 7-8 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Austin, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, cleared only 7-6  
and was tied for eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Mark Crear, the U.S. champion and the only 110-meter  
hurdler under 13.00 this year, was disqualified in the 
quarterfinals after false-starting twice. The U.S. team protested, 
claiming that one false start should have been charged to Florian 
Schwarthoff of Germany. The protest was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Johnson, the two-time defending hurdles champion and 1996  
Olympic gold medalist, advanced to the semifinals, but looked rusty 
after a six-week layoff. Britain's Colin Jackson, the world 
record-holder, also reached the semifinals by winning his two 
first-round heats. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Johnson, the three-time defending champion in the 400,  
reached the semifinals by winning his quarterfinal heat in 45.10.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Gain / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Overseas investors looking to take advantage of  
rising Tokyo share prices actively bought yen today, sending the 
dollar to a seven-month low against the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 110.74 yen in late trading, down 0.78 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
111.52 yen Friday. The dollar last traded below 111.00 yen in Tokyo 
on Jan. 12, when the currency sank as low as 108.65 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 135.44  
points, or 0.75 percent, to finish at 18,233.55. On Friday, the 
average closed up 218.37 points, or 1.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, interbank players initially bought back  
the yen by selling dollars to adjust positions on the stock 
market's advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, the dollar lost further ground as overseas  
investors bought the yen to finance their buying of Japanese 
stocks, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen's gain came despite renewed caution by Japan's Vice  
Finance Minister for International Affairs Haruhiko Kuroda, who 
told reporters today that the yen's recent appreciation did not 
reflect fundamentals and that a ``premature'' strengthening was 
unwelcome. A stronger yen hurts Japanese exports by making them 
more expensive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Some said the dropping dollar reflected new confidence in  
Japan's struggling economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar's fall clearly comes from an increasing trust in  
the Japanese economy and stock prices,'' said Shigeru Hashimoto, 
vice president of foreign exchange at Sanwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback ranged between 110.60 yen and 111.37 yen during  
the day's trading. In other currencies, the euro was traded at 
118.18 yen, down from 119.16 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices were higher amid active buying of  
banking and other financial issues following Friday's announcement 
by three major Japanese commercial banks that they will form a 
joint holding company next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and  
Fuji Bank Ltd. formally said they will merge in the autumn of 2000 
to consolidate their operations. The new entity will become the 
world's largest financial institution with assets of around $1.26 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains in U.S. stocks Friday were also supporting select Japanese  
international blue chips, although many other exporter shares 
remained in negative territory on worries about the yen's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``The yen's prospects are a major source of concern in the  
market,'' said Tadaaki Tano of Daiwa Securities SB Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the yen strengthens below 110 yen to the dollar, fears of  
the yen's advance towards 100 yen to the dollar would deter foreign 
investors from continuing their buying,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 136.77 points  
to 11,100.61 at Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 19.78 points, or 1.32 percent, to 1,518.72. 
This was the highest close this year for the bank-heavy TOPIX. 
</P>
<P>
	The index had closed up 23.59 points, or 1.60 percent, on  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 965.63 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 841.98 million shares 
Friday and the most since June 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers outnumbered decliners 699 to 503, with 117 issues  
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.9200 percent from Friday's finish of 1.8650 percent, 
driving its price down to 98.98 yen from 99.44 yen.

<HEADLINE> Jeff Baxter May Run for Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jeff ``Skunk'' Baxter, a former Steely Dan  
and Doobie Brothers guitarist, said he won't let his past of sex, 
drugs and rock 'n' roll cripple a campaign for Congress if he 
decides to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to admit that I did all that stuff,'' Baxter, 50,  
said Monday. ``But the most important thing is to learn from your 
past.''

<P>
	In an interview at his West Los Angeles recording studio, the  
composer and producer said he is contemplating a Republican 
challenge next year for the House seat held by Rep. Brad Sherman, 
D-Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Baxter said he developed an interest in politics after Rep. Curt  
Weldon, R-Pa., asked him to join a civilian advisory board on 
ballistic-missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not Thomas Jefferson reincarnated, but America has been  
really good to me,'' Baxter said. ``Now, I just want to give 
something back and serve my country.''

	Foreign Rescue Teams Leaving Turkey  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's public works minister said  
housing may not be ready for the 200,000 homeless earthquake 
victims until late November, when cold rains usually pelt the area. 
A quick response to the housing crisis could help ease public anger 
toward the government and military, which many Turks feel has not 
responded well to the earthquake. A Dutch group said it would send 
30,000 prefabricated shelters designed to withstand quakes and 
winter cold and the United Nations said it was looking for 10,000 
tents, but Turkish officials have been insisting the nation can 
climb out of the crisis alone. The casualty toll crept up to 12,134 
dead and 33,384 injured today.

	Bret May Lead to Flooding  
</P>
<P>
	CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- Although Hurricane Bret weakened  
into a tropical storm this morning, the danger hasn't entirely 
passed. Laredo residents braced for flooding as Bret moved slowly 
across Texas' tip with drenching rain of 8 to 12 inches. About 
3,500 people on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border left their 
homes for higher ground. They streamed back to their mostly 
unscathed homes today after the storm threaded the needle between 
Corpus Christi and Brownsville and pushed through open ranch land 
without causing a single death.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scottish prosecutors assured relatives of Pan

on charges they carried out the 1988 bombing over Lockerbie, 
Scotland. Nearly 200 relatives attended a meeting to receive 
updates on preparations being made for the February trial against 
alleged Libyan agents accused of planting a suitcase bomb on the 
Pan Am jetliner. The attack killed 270 people, including 189 
Americans. To persuade Libya to turn over the suspects the British

hasn't yet arranged a visit by a top leader of the communist 
regime, a spokesman said today. Former Defense Secretary William 
Perry issued an invitation to Washington three months ago during 
his trip to North Korea. As special envoy, Perry is evaluating U.S.

release of Gen. Augusto Pinochet on humanitarian grounds, 
announcing that a British doctor would be asked to examine the 
ex-dictator to bolster claims of his failing health. The move comes 
only weeks before talks on whether Pinochet's health should 
constitute grounds for his release. Foreign Minister Juan Gabriel 
Valdes said he expects talks with the British government by 
October. Pinochet remains under police custody near London, 
fighting extradition to Spain, where a judge wants to try him on 
charges of torture stemming from his 1973-90 dictatorship.

<HEADLINE> Marino Takes Stand in Martin Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino called  
teammate Tony Martin a ``good person'' during testimony in the 
receiver's trial on money-laundering charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a loyal teammate,'' the NFL's all-time leading passer  
said during his five-minute testimony. ``I don't believe Tony to be 
someone that would willingly commit a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Dolphins receiver Nat Moore was another of three  
character witnesses called by Martin's defense, which rested his 
case after less than 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is being tried alongside Rickey Brownlee, who served  
seven years in prison for two 1980s drug convictions, in a case 
centering on Brownlee's alleged drug activities from 1994 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino spent about an hour waiting in a side room of Miami's  
federal courthouse while prosecutors finished cross-examination of 
the final witness in Brownlee's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran quarterback said he first met Martin when the  
receiver first joined the Dolphins in 1989, and that Martin has 
accepted invitations to his house and met his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by assistant U.S. Attorney Ron DeWaard whether he had any  
testimony to give in the case, Marino said: ``Other than what I 
know about Tony as a person, no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeWaard drew a few chuckles when he ended his cross-examination  
by telling Marino, ``Good luck this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino said nothing as he left the courthouse accompanied by  
O.J. McDuffie, another Dolphins receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, who played 13 years for the Dolphins, said he helped  
Martin make the conversion to wide receiver from quarterback, the 
position Martin played in college. Now owner of a special-events 
company that does business with the NFL, Moore told jurors that 
Martin often helps out at youth clinics he organizes. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing that we try not to do in the camps is bring in guys  
that aren't appropriate, guys that get in trouble. We don't invite 
them,'' Moore said. ``We invited Tony because we always saw him as 
a good person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brownlee's defense rested following cross-examination of former  
business partner Damain Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Opa-locka convenience store owner steadfastly held to  
his testimony that his money reimbursed Martin for $100,000 in 
lawyer's fees and that prosecutors were trying to trip him up 
during a grand jury appearance last December. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was money I got from my store over two or three years,''  
Toledo told DeWaard. ``Are you saying I can't have any money?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo has been jailed since Dec. 4, charged with civil contempt  
after he stopped answering questions before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 33, is accused of leasing three cars in his name on  
behalf of Brownlee, who paid him back with cash. He also is accused 
of writing a $100,000 check to Brownlee's first lawyer in exchange 
for cash. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether Martin, who has known Brownlee since  
childhood and calls him his uncle, knowingly accepted drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing arguments are expected Tuesday, with the jury to receive  
the case no later than Wednesday. Jurors were given Friday off as 
Moore worked with lawyers on jury instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	The break also allowed Martin to join his teammates in San Diego  
for a Friday workout and the exhibition game. Martin caught three 
passes for 32 yards Saturday night, but also dropped a couple of 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
	``For what little practice time Tony has had, he did a nice  
job,'' coach Jimmy Johnson said Sunday. ``He caught the ball well 
and ran good routes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, despite the idleness of sitting at a court table for  
much of the past three weeks, said he felt ``elusive and quick'' 
against the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very tough not to be there in practice and come out and  
get any rhythm going,'' said the receiver, who rejoined the 
Dolphins this spring after playing the past five years in San Diego 
and Atlanta. ``I thought we did a good job.''

<HEADLINE> Sehorn's Return to Giants Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Jason Sehorn is certain the hamstring injury  
that has sidelined him since the New York Giants began training 
camp will heal. 
</P>
<P>
	Just when, no one seems to know. And that's starting to look  
like a problem, with the regular season scheduled to begin in less 
than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn, who missed all of last season with a knee injury, had  
another minor setback last Wednesday when he felt a twinge in his 
left leg while doing agility drills. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors told Sehorn it was just a piece of scar tissue coming  
loose after weeks of inactivity. Still, the six-year veteran has 
been told to do nothing on the field this week. 
</P>
<P>
	When he got into a three-point stance out of boredom on Monday,  
a trainer came over and quickly told him to cut it out. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the NFL's top cover cornerbacks before his injury, Sehorn  
is doing his best to remain positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to change now, but yeah, it is a little  
frustrating,'' Sehorn said after watching the Giants work out 
Monday. ``You have to hang in there. There is no sense in beating 
yourself up or getting too down. There is nothing I can do but let 
the body heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A typical day for Sehorn now involves several sessions in the  
training room along with swimming, riding a stationary bike and 
walking on a treadmill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them they find any experimental method to heal this,  
I'll take it,'' Sehorn said. ``I don't care at this point, it will 
be pretty gratifying to play. Nothing against you guys, but I'll 
give you something to talk about other than my divorce and my 
injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants are a little thin at the cornerback spot now. Not  
only is Sehorn out, but so is Conrad Hamilton, who replaced him 
last year. He sustained a high ankle sprain in an intrasquad 
scrimmage on Aug. 7 and is still out. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton doesn't expect to return until next week at the  
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he is healthy Sehorn has no doubts that his surgically  
repaired right knee will be fine. He injured it last August 
returning a kickoff against the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the least of my problems,'' said Sehorn, who had 11  
interceptions combined in 1996 and '97. ``I don't even think about 
my knee. My knee is completely solid. I can do any agility drill, 
any kind of lateral cut, plant and go. I just want to be able to 
run full speed and not worry about something coming loose or a flat 
tire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn has had two MRIs on his hamstring. While neither has  
found any major problems, they have shown swelling and a little 
blood near the sciatic nerve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know anything about a hamstring other than it hurts,''  
Sehorn said. ``There is nothing I can do. I can't force the issue. 
I tried that, twice. It didn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn angered some teammates in the offseason by skipping some  
optional workouts so he could rehabilitate his knee on the West 
Coast. He also has upset people by being a little aloof. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next week, Sehorn plans on doing nothing but watching  
football, which he says can be pretty boring. While he still wants 
to play in the opener against Tampa Bay on Sept. 12, he doesn't 
know if that will be possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to try to listen for a change,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fryar Works To Fit In With Skins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Thirty minutes after his first practice with  
the Washington Redskins ended, Irving Fryar remained on the field, 
getting a crash course on the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with passing game coordinator Terry Robiskie and backup  
quarterback John Paci, the five-time Pro Bowl receiver learned when 
to cut inside and when to hitch-and-go. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbering system is a little bit different,'' Fryar said.  
``It's not hard to pick up. Plus, when it boils down to it, it's 
just playing football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Fryar has it down pat by opening day, he'll have mastered  
something that still escapes fifth-year Redskins veteran Michael 
Westbrook: the ability to consistently run the pass routes 
correctly. Westbrook messed up a pattern in the end zone during 
Friday night's exhibition victory over Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryar, who turns 37 next month, was coaxed out of retirement to  
sign with the Redskins on Thursday. His first practice was 
Saturday, and he will probably see some limited action in Saturday 
night's game at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not in great shape,'' Fryar said. ``I'm in a little bit of  
shape. I was retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fryar initially will work as a third-down receiver, although  
many more gaffes by Westbrook and Albert Connell could land him 
back in the starting role he's used to after 15 seasons with New 
England, Miami and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``With that kind of experience, he ought to be ready to play  
tomorrow,'' Robiskie said. ``He's been playing 15 years. He knows 
every route.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after Fryar signed, he said his final season with  
the Eagles was the worst year of his life. That seemed a bit of an 
exaggeration given his life story, but the troubled 
star-turned-preacher insists it's true. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly, last year was the worst year of my life,'' Fryar  
said. ``And I'm talking about having been on drugs and almost 
losing my family, being in jail and all that kind of stuff. None of 
those can amount to what I went through last year. My intention is 
to come in here and help this team, but No. 1 my intention is to 
come in here and have fun. Because I left the game really, really 
bitter last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although reluctant to go into detail, Fryar said the losing  
atmosphere with the 3-13 Eagles combined with some personal matters 
-- some football-related and some not -- to leave him feeling 
betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing good that came out of last year was that I made  
it through another year alive,'' Fryar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryar offered one example: When his 13-year-old son dropped a  
pass in a community league game, a fan yelled: ``You're just like 
your Daddy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's totally uncalled for,'' Fryar said. ``If I go over and  
say something to him, I'm the bad guy. Little things like that we 
had to deal with because the team wasn't doing well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Eagles planning to release him, Fryar decided to retire  
rather than move his wife and four children yet again to play for 
another team. He was working for a television station in 
Philadelphia when the Redskins called, and he accepted because 
Washington is two hours away from his home in Mount Holly, N.J. 
While playing for Washington, he'll stay at a local hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good already,'' Fryar said. ``It just feels good to be  
wanted.''

<HEADLINE> On-Line Baby Albums Created for Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Austin Kirts can't even click a mouse  
button yet, but he's already on his way to becoming a bit of a 
cyberspace celebrity in some circles. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin's father, Carl Kirts of West Palm Beach, Fla., used an  
``e-Stork'' kit to help create an online baby album. Relatives and 
friends around the world log on to the Kirts' Web site to see 
Austin in the hospital, Austin sleeping, and Austin and dad on the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a baby album for ourselves but this is more for other  
people,'' said Carl Kirts. ``We moved about six years ago, so we 
don't see our friends or family a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The kits are the brainchild of Kathryn and David Besemer, owners  
of the Boulder-based Cognitio Products Inc., who dreamed up the 
concept after they built a Web site for their daughter Ayla in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought this would be a great way to use the Internet,''  
Mrs. Besemer said. ``It was just such a warm celebration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple tossed the idea around a bit before launching e-Stork  
in October. Since then, they have sold about 2,000 of the kits, 
which go for $39.95 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	While there are many ways for computer-savvy individuals to  
build Web sites, the Besemers say their product is intended for 
casual Internet users who want an online photograph album but lack 
the tools and skills to accomplish it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a vast number of people who know how to get to w-w-w  
dot something but don't know the first thing about how to build a 
Web site,'' said Mrs. Besemer. 
</P>
<P>
	The kits are designed to be user-friendly. Parents fill out  
information cards and send photographs, sound recordings, videos 
and narratives to the Besemers, who pledge to have a private Web 
site posted within 72 hours. It will be available to browsers for 
three months and can be extended to last longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Besemer, a computer consultant, designed the software for  
building the e-Stork Web sites. It takes about an hour and a half 
to get each album online. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a fun business,'' Mrs. Besemer said. ``We look at  
pictures of babies all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kirts' site features pictures of Austin on a light blue  
``little slugger'' background with baseballs and bats. It also has 
a guest book that has been signed by nearly 80 well-wishers from as 
far away as Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kirts put the Web site address on their birth announcements  
so friends and family could look at the album. To ensure privacy, 
the address is comprised of a letter and number combination that is 
given to parents for distribution, but should be undetectable to 
search engines. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has yet to turn a profit.  
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say e-Stork will have to offer something beyond  
photograph postings to make it commercially. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to provide something more compelling than what you  
could do on your own,'' said Carol Ferrara, an analyst with Gartner 
Group, which is based in Stamford, Conn. ``It's what they do around 
the pictures that's going to be important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Family-related Web sites with themes such as weddings or  
ancestry have become a fast-growing area of Internet service, Ms. 
Ferrara said. The key to success is offering some sort of 
interactive or specialized service, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The creators of e-Stork say their product is specialized because  
it offers interactive options such as a guest book and e-mail 
links. It also takes the time-consuming task of building a baby 
album out of the hands of busy new parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a new baby, you only have so much time,'' Mrs.  
Besemer said.

<HEADLINE> Escaped Killer Confused by New World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENDENHALL, Pa. (AP) -- A killer who escaped from prison after  
nearly 20 years behind bars was confounded by a new world of 
self-service gasoline pumps, ATM machines and housing developments 
in what were once fields. 
</P>
<P>
	After his escape on Aug. 2, it appears that Norman Johnston  
mostly ran scared and confused through the twisting back roads of 
his home terrain in southeastern Pennsylvania, Maryland and 
Delaware. He was captured on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston and his two brothers were part of a murderous,  
multimillion-dollar burglary ring whose story was told in the Sean 
Penn movie ``At Close Range.'' He was convicted in 1980, and he and 
his brothers, Bruce and David, were all sentenced to life. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Johnston, 48, escaped from the state prison  
at Huntingdon in central Pennsylvania, cutting his way through a 
cell window and two fences. He left behind an elaborate dummy that 
gave him as much as a 10-hour head start. 
</P>
<P>
	He stole a car outside the prison and headed back to  
southeastern Pennsylvania, where he grew up and had run the 
burglary ring. 
</P>
<P>
	While on the run, Johnston scrounged for food, possibly  
contacted friends and relatives for help, and slept wherever he 
could find a safe spot. He stole cars to get around but was slowed 
by the changing times. 
</P>
<P>
	The fugitive couldn't figure out how to fill the gas tank of his  
stolen 1980 Oldsmobile when he pulled into a convenience store and 
had to ask for help from an attendant working the overnight shift, 
state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not know how to operate a self-serve gasoline pump,''  
said Capt. Henry Oleyniczak, who headed the task force that pursued 
Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
	Police noted that he never stole an ATM card or cellular phone,  
instead keeping a pile of quarters to operate pay phones. Police 
nearly caught him twice -- once at a diner near the University of 
Delaware campus in Newark -- as he made pay phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with changing technology, the lay of the land where  
Johnston ran the burglary ring had been altered by housing 
developments. It was a cul-de-sac of one of those developments in 
Mendenhall where he was finally caught. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew when he went in there, there was no way out of that  
development,'' said Trooper Louis Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	After Robinson spotted him late Thursday, Johnston fled in a  
stolen car down back roads, eventually turning into the cul-de-sac 
and crashing. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 officers searched the area with helicopters and  
dog teams. While officers interviewed a couple who had reported a 
noise, Johnston walked into view, and troopers rushed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pretty dirty, his legs were cut up, and he was bruised  
from running through the bushes,'' Trooper John Malone said. ``He 
wasn't arrogant with us at all. He was very humble. He said he just 
wanted to be free.''

<HEADLINE> Police Want Rodman Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Police want the district attorney's  
office to file misdemeanor public drunkenness charges against 
former NBA star Dennis Rodman for his role in a disturbance at a 
waterfront restaurant and bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport Beach police recommended Rodman be charged because he  
was offered a chance to leave the restaurant and didn't, Sgt. Mike 
McDermott said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, 38, who was waived by the Los Angeles Lakers last April  
after a brief, stormy stay with the team, was released on his own 
recognizance early Sunday morning after spending several hours in 
jail. He was arrested outside the restaurant about 9 p.m. PDT 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also arrested was Donn Emerson, 36, who was booked for  
investigation of obstructing a police officer, a misdemeanor, after 
he allegedly tried to interfere with police taking Rodman into 
custody. Emerson was released on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney's office is expected to decide whether to  
file charges prior to Rodman's scheduled Oct. 1 court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Restaurant owner Ralph Furra, whose wife, Julie, was managing  
the bar at the time, said a woman apparently was taunting Rodman, 
that he responded, and then the woman's boyfriend grabbed Rodman. 
Police were called and asked Rodman to take a taxi home, but he 
refused.

<HEADLINE> Howard Stern Settles Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Howard Stern has agreed to accept $50,000 to  
settle a lawsuit he filed against a Beverly Hills studio he claimed 
reneged on a deal to feature him in a movie with Melanie Griffith, 
a lawyer for the studio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection had been scheduled to start Monday in the lawsuit  
filed by the New York-based radio host against Ministry of Film 
Inc. and its president, Alan Mruvka. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern contended the studio recruited him for the movie ``Jane''  
knowing it didn't have financing, then failed to pay him when the 
movie wasn't made. He sought $1.5 million in compensatory damages 
and unspecified punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was settled for $50,000, said Philip Levy, the  
defendant's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely were looking forward to the trial, expected a  
verdict in our favor and looked forward to suing Stern for 
malicious prosecution,'' Levy said. ``But any time you can settle a 
$1.5 million claim for pennies on the dollar, settlement is the 
smart play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phone messages left with Stern's attorney and agent were not  
returned.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Chip May Improve Digital TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) -- Motorola Inc. said today it has  
developed a chip designed to improve reception of digital 
television signals in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its digital signal processing architecture,  
called the MCT2100 demodulator chip, reduces the effects of 
``multiple reflections,'' which occur when obstacles -- such as a 
building or truck -- block digital signals. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola, an electronics and telecommunications firm based in  
Schaumburg, Ill., created the chip in conjunction with technology 
company Sarnoff Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola said the new technology would help digital television  
providers meet the Federal Communications Commission's transmission 
standard.

<HEADLINE>  Turkish Industry Survives Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IZMIT, Turkey (AP) -- The car-repair shop where Cihan Cakiroglu  
worked is twisted wreckage, his boss is dead, and the August 
paycheck thatis now homeless family needs will never come. 
</P>
<P>
	At the nearby Goodyear tire plant, the blue steel walls still  
stand, but most of the employees are too busy searching for 
relatives or shelter for their families to show up for work. 
</P>
<P>
	Turks nationwide are struggling to recover from the massive,  
7.4-magnitude earthquake that struck the country's industrial 
heartland early Tuesday. The social and economic costs appear to be 
staggering. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of homeless people like Cakiroglu are demanding that  
the government help them buy new homes and furniture and find them 
new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say each day remaining factories like the Goodyear plant  
remain idle leads to a loss of $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, already struggling to cut back a federal budget  
deficit, is strapped for the cash needed to repair basic 
infrastructure, including roads, bridges and electrical lines. And 
the area hit provides almost half the tax revenue, meaning the 
government will have even less income to count on. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost to the economy could top $20 billion -- 10 percent of  
the country's gross national product and enough to drag the country 
back into recession, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Government spokesman Sukru Sina Gurel said the economic damage  
to the country could ``be beyond what any tragic event in the 
history of Turkey has caused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulent Akgerman, head of the Aegean Young Businessmen  
Association, has suggested a six-day work week to overcome the 
impact of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Other industrialists are demanding aid from the international  
community, which has already provided $500 million in loans and 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we will be able to deal with it smoothly if we  
receive support from international organizations,'' said Tevfik 
Aksoy, chief economist of Istanbul's Bank Ekspres. ``I seriously 
doubt that Turkey will be left alone on this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also pointed out that the crucial cement, automobile and tire  
factories that make western Turkey so important to the economy have 
been left largely undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
	They are expected to reopen soon, which will no doubt help ease  
the strain of the earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Goodyear plant in Izmit, for example, was built with steel  
walls and survived the earthquake, unlike many local homes and 
buildings made of cheap cement, said engineering manager Mehmet 
Turkel. 
</P>
<P>
	Some equipment was damaged, he said, but the plant should be  
able to reopen quickly, and its 500 employees should return to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you come here in a week, you'll see this plant running,''  
he said. ``People want it to happen.'' But the plant will wait a 
few days more for the search for survivors and possessions to end. 
Five of the plant's workers are believed to have been killed in the 
quake, and almost half have lost their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Personnel manager Harun Savas said the plant is offering tea and  
sandwiches to workers who come in to help assess damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to start a new life,'' said Savas, who pulled the  
bodies of five of his relatives from the wreckage of their homes 
and later helped bury them. 
</P>
<P>
	His house survived the earthquake, but his 12-year-old son,  
Cagdas, was too frightened to stay in Izmit and has gone with 
Savas' wife and daughter to live with relatives on the Black Sea 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the major problem will be how to get people back to  
work,'' said Haluk Tukel, the secretary-general of TUSIAD, the 
country's leading organization of industrialists. 
</P>
<P>
	But for many people, there is no longer any work to speak of.  
</P>
<P>
	In a grassy lot in front of a 50-foot pile of rubble, Cakiroglu  
stood beside his new home -- a brown blanket held up by a few sticks 
of wood. It is here that he sleeps with his wife and 3-year-old 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm willing to do anything, even sell pretzels on the  
street,'' Cakiroglu said.

<HEADLINE> Tears, Laughter at Perrot Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- There were tears but little mourning Monday as  
fans, family and Kim Perrot's Houston Comets teammates both laughed 
and wept while they relived special moments from the feisty point 
guard's all-too-short life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be here today if she hadn't fought me,'' joked a  
misty-eyed Comets coach Van Chancellor, who recalled for the 1,000 
attending the Second Baptist Church memorial service how he 
``mis-coached'' Perrot their first year together. 
</P>
<P>
	He met the 32-year-old Lafayette, La. native just two years ago  
at a Houston high school gym, where he was holding tryouts for the 
new WNBA franchise. What he saw, he didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too wild, too small and too everything,'' Chancellor said,  
laughing at how he underestimated the 5-foot-5 Perrot and continued 
to do so even though that first season ended with WNBA championship 
rings. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor reassessed his mistakes after he received a letter  
from two fans. 
</P>
<P>
	'' 'Van Chancellor, you are mis-coaching Kim Perrot,' '' he  
recalled the letter read. ``Point guards like her are hard to find, 
and we are writing Les Alexander to say that coaches like you are a 
dime a dozen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diagnosed with cancer last February, Perrot died in Houston on  
Thursday. Burial in her hometown was scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kim was special. Kim used her gifts to the fullest'' said  
Leslie Alexander, owner of the Houston Comets and the Houston 
Rockets. ``She never gave up on her dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor said he and Perrot often joked that their great skill  
was responsible for the success enjoyed by two-time MVP Cynthia 
Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
	When Chancellor teased back, asking how he figured she was  
involved, Perrot quickly responded: '' 'You call all the plays and 
I'm passing her all the basketballs.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Blinking tears, Chancellor softly remarked: ``What a fun person.  
There will never be another Kim Perrot in my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper, who was at Perrot's bedside when she died last week,  
said it was her best friend's generous spirit and love of people 
that left a mark on the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason she touched so many lives is because Kim had a  
courageous heart,'' Cooper said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pan Am 103 Families Get Briefings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scottish prosecutors assured relatives of Pan  
Am 103 victims Monday that ``no deals'' have been made and two 
Libyans will be prosecuted vigorously on charges they carried out 
the 1988 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've assured the family members that there have been no  
deals,'' said Lord Hardie, Scotland's senior law officer. ``There 
have been no deals and there will be no deals to hold back any 
available evidence in this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 200 relatives attended a private meeting to receive  
updates on preparations being made for the trial next February 
against alleged Libyan agents accused of planting a suitcase bomb 
on the Pan Am jetliner. The attack killed 270 people, including 189 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	To persuade Libya to turn over the suspects -- Abdel Basset Ali  
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah -- the British and U.S. 
governments agreed to hold the trial at Camp Zeist, Netherlands, 30 
miles southeast of Amsterdam. Under a treaty, the camp will be 
considered Scottish territory for the duration of the trial, which 
will be conducted under Scottish law. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Cohen of Cape May Court House, N.J., opposes the deal,  
contending it essentially rewarded Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 
for turning over the suspects. Like other victims' families, Mrs. 
Cohen believes Gadhafi ordered the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those two men going on trial could never have acted  
independently,'' said Mrs. Cohen, who lost her 20-year-old 
daughter, Theodora, in the explosion. ``I'm afraid that Gadhafi 
will come out of this without a scratch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But James Foley, a State Department spokesman, said officials  
worked diligently to put pressure on Gadhafi ``to allow a fair 
trial outside Libya.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Williams of Joppa, Md., said he was relieved to see any  
type of action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll take from this whatever we can get,'' said Williams, who  
lost his 24-year-old son, Geordie. ``I'm glad to see things finally 
moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Hardie, officials from the FBI and Justice  
Department also met with family members. Attorney General Janet 
Reno addressed the group briefly as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Families of the victims will be allowed to attend the trial with  
help from the British and U.S. governments. Alternatively, they can 
watch the proceeding from designated sites through encrypted 
satellite links that will be established for them. An Internet Web 
site also will be available to help relatives keep track of 
developments in the trial.

<HEADLINE> Companies Team on Wireless Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucent Technologies, Nokia and 3Com are helping  
found a new industry group that will adopt standards for wireless 
computer networks and certify products that meet those standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance, WECA, hopes to  
make go-anywhere computing as commonplace as using a mobile phone 
by making it less of a gamble for consumers and network operators 
to invest in expensive wireless equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	While users of laptop computers and other portable devices can  
already dial-up to the Internet and private company networks with a 
wireless modem, the connections are often slow and unreliable from 
location to location. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry envisions a more robust, dependable link with local  
wireless networks deployed everywhere -- airports, parks, highways, 
homes -- like the cellular ``pods'' that provide continuous mobile 
phone service as a person travels. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, such ``local area networks,'' or LANs, have been  
deployed only sparingly in corporate settings such as a company 
building or campus. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a sign of things to come, the new iBook laptop from Apple  
Computer was introduced with an optional wireless transmitter that 
allows users to roam their homes or offices freely while using the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the visions of wireless in general is that you're no  
longer tied to a physical location when you want to communicate,'' 
said Craig Mathias, chairman of the Wireless LAN Research 
Laboratory at the Worcester Polytecnic Institute in Massachusetts. 
``Most people who travel with computers have to find a telephone 
that they physically plug into. It's so nice with a wireless 
network. You just turn it on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WECA, expected to be introduced Monday, will establish a test  
lab to certify the compatibility of any member's products. A seal 
of approval would be issued to reassure would-be purchasers of 
expensive wireless equipment for computers and networks. 
</P>
<P>
	WECA ``will enable true multi-vendor interoperability by  
certifying that systems from different manufacturers can be used 
within the same wireless infrastructure,'' the group said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	WECA's founding cast includes Aironet, Intersil, and Symbol  
Technologies. But the group gains immediate credibility with 
Lucent, perhaps the top name in communications technology, as well 
as a major name in mobile phones with Nokia, and in data networking 
with 3Com. 
</P>
<P>
	Conspicuously absent for now, however, are Cisco Systems and  
Nortel Networks, Lucent's two chief rivals in data networking and 
communications technology.

<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Md. (AP) -- The Baltimore Ravens on Monday released  
eight players, including Wally Richardson, the team's third-string 
quarterback since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The move all but ensures a roster spot for quarterback Stoney  
Case, who the Ravens signed last week following his release by the

<P>
	Richardson, a seventh-round draft pick out of Penn State in  
1997, took just six snaps in his time with the Ravens, completing 
one of two pass attempts. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
	ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) -- The head of Kazakstan's national oil  
company, one of the country's most important businesses, was fired 
for ``exceeding his authority,'' the government announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nurlan Kapparov was dismissed as the president of Kazakoil, and  
the company's vice president, Uzakbai Karabalin, was named acting 
president, a government statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kapparov was fired for ``exceeding his authority in deciding  
important strategic issues,'' the statement said, without providing 
additional details. 
</P>
<P>
	Since gaining independence in 1991, Kazakstan has been working  
with several leading Western oil companies to develop its vast 
reserves near the Caspian Sea. However, the projects have been 
moving relatively slowly and Kazakstan has not realized an oil boom 
as many had predicted.

<HEADLINE> Smith's Agent Talks With Bengals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Akili Smith is a little closer to getting a  
contract agreement with the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Leigh Steinberg flew into Cincinnati on Sunday and held  
several hours of talks with general manager Mike Brown and other 
front-office officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked all day. We made a little progress,'' Steinberg said  
late Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides planned to resume talks today in hopes of breaking  
an impasse that has kept the quarterback from Oregon out of 
training camp and caused him to miss the first two preseason games. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the third overall pick in the draft, has been working out  
on the West Coast while the Bengals lost their first two preseason 
games. They failed to cross Detroit's 40-yard line until the fourth 
quarter of a 16-0 loss Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Bengals have planned all along to use Smith as a  
backup to Jeff Blake this season, the long contract impasse has 
caused him to miss valuable practice time in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did have a month and a half with us (before training camp)  
here, so he would be farther along than somebody who came to 
minicamp and we hadn't seen him since,'' coach Bruce Coslet said. 
``But to say that he would at this point be the No. 2 quarterback, 
I don't know. We'll have to see how fast he learns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has turned into the Bengals' longest contract impasse with a  
quarterback since David Klingler missed most of training camp in 
1992. Klingler also was a Steinberg client. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg got quick deals for first-round picks Dan Wilkinson  
and Ki-Jana Carter in the 1990s, and both got voidable-year deals 
from the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	Unhappy with how those two players have produced, the Bengals  
have insisted on a deal for Smith tied more closely to performance. 
Steinberg has pushed for a deal more like the one that Cleveland 
gave quarterback Tim Couch, taken No. 1 overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess we haven't been willing to necessarily do the Couch or  
(Ryan) Leaf deals and tried to explain to them the reasons why 
not,'' Bengals executive vice president Katherine Blackburn said 
Saturday. ``We've tried to address the problems that come up with 
those contracts in a few different ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before arriving in Cincinnati, Steinberg noted that Smith was  
his last unsigned client. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got 77 players signed and in camp and one out,'' he said.  
``We have nine draft picks signed and one out. It's the same 
person. We've worked hard to have our players signed on time and 
being part of the training camp experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a situation where we simply want Akili salaried in the  
same way that similarly situated quarterbacks have been in recent 
years.''

<HEADLINE> Stiff Back Keeps McNair Sidelined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Steve McNair will be watching from the  
sidelines Friday night when the Tennessee Titans finally play their 
first game in their new home stadium, coach Jeff Fisher said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterback has not played or practiced since the Titans'  
first exhibition game Aug. 15 at Kansas City because of spasms and 
stiffness in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said team doctors advised taking advantage of the  
preseason and allowing McNair enough rest to fully heal his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``No reason to be alarmed, but ... we want to ensure that we  
have Steve for the long run and not get into a situation where we 
complicate things,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means McNair won't get a chance to face the Atlanta  
Falcons' Chris Chandler on Friday night. McNair was promoted to 
starter in 1997 after the franchise traded Chandler to the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair led Tennessee to a 31-16 exhibition victory last season  
in the preseason opener for both teams. The teams also meet Dec. 19 
in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said McNair's back is improving daily and is on schedule  
for him to start the Titans' final exhibition game Sept. 2 against 
New Orleans. Traditionally, Fisher played his starters only a 
series or two in the final exhibition, but he said he plans to play 
McNair for a half and the first series of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to need the work,'' Fisher said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Fisher said he isn't worried about McNair not having enough  
time to be ready for the season opener Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't Steve's first year as the starter. He's played two  
years and come back after injuries, especially last year, and 
played well after not practicing,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair agreed with the decision. He said he prefers to be  
healthy when the regular season starts. 
</P>
<P>
	That means backup Neil O'Donnell will make his second start of  
the preseason. O'Donnell is 21-of-34 for 166 yards in two games, 
and he led the first-teamers to a 10-0 lead last weekend in a 27-17 
loss to the Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Matthews, intercepted on both passes he threw last week,  
will follow O'Donnell with rookie Kevin Daft finishing up.

<HEADLINE> Milk Suppliers Bring Hope for N.D. / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- New dairy ventures aimed at boosting the  
economy of northwestern North Dakota could help processing plants 
in other parts of the state that need milk. 
</P>
<P>
	Western Star Dairy Cooperative near Williston and Northwestern  
Dairy LLC in Mountrail County hope eventually to milk more than 
1,500 cows each. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers of both groups say they want not only to put money in  
the pockets of farmers and ranchers but also to create jobs and 
spin off businesses, such as contracted feed suppliers and milk 
haulers, to benefit the entire region. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've tried to attract manufacturers into the area, but it  
hasn't worked,'' said Kent Onstad of Parshall, president of 
Northwestern Dairy. ``Not being along a major four-lane highway, we 
don't get that kind of attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State officials hope the new suppliers can help fill capacity at  
struggling milk processing plants, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a dairy plant capacity that is not being fully  
utilized,'' said North Dakota Dairy Commissioner Roger Scheibe. 
``For those plants to be profitable, to retain their employees, we 
need to have more milk supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1993 and 1998, milk production in North Dakota dropped  
from 918 million pounds to 706 million pounds, according to the 
North Dakota Agricultural Statistics Service. Per-cow production 
increased, but the number of milk cows and dairy farmers fell 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no plant in North Dakota that is running at  
capacity,'' said Virgil Johnson, owner of Dakota Country Cheese in 
Mandan. ``There isn't enough milk available.''

	AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- A group identified on an anarchists'  
Internet site as ``Seeds of Resistance'' has claimed responsibility 
for destroying a crop of genetically engineered corn at the 
University of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	A notice from the group appeared on the Web site A-Infos after  
about 1,000 stalks of corn were destroyed, probably with a machete, 
overnight last Wednesday at the university-owned Rogers Farm in Old 
Town, near the Orono campus. 
</P>
<P>
	The university police's investigation continued Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	A-Infos, described as ``a multilingual news service by, for and  
about anarchists,'' carried the ``communique'' from Maine in which 
Seeds of Resistance claimed responsibility for the destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first in a series of actions,'' the notice said.  
``This action was taken in an effort to send a message to those who 
seek to benefit from the risky endeavor of genetically engineering 
the food supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group, which identified itself no further, said if finds  
``absolutely no benefit to humanity'' from corn grown at the Old 
Town experimental site, adding that the plants ``are only designed 
to sell more herbicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A university researcher said he was using the corn to study its  
resistance to the Monsanto Corp. herbicide Roundup. The seed was 
donated by DeKalb Seed Co., a Monsanto subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	The researcher, John Jemison of the university's cooperative  
extension service, described the vandalism as an act of 
``ecoterrorism'' and said similar crops have been targeted 
elsewhere by activists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maine Legislature rejected a proposal this year that would  
have required the labeling of unprocessed, genetically engineered 
food. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman announced plans to  
study the long-term impact on the environment of genetically 
altered foods, but he did not suggest that it be labeled.

<HEADLINE> Royals 2B Out with Finger Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Rookie second baseman Carlos Febles will  
be out two or three weeks with ligament damage to the little finger 
of his left hand, the Kansas City Royals said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Febles tore ligaments in the finger while sliding into second  
against Tampa Bay on Friday. He left the game immediately and has 
not played since. 
</P>
<P>
	After a re-examination in Kansas City on Monday, the finger was  
placed in a splint and Febles was put on the 15-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts us tremendously, '' said manager Tony Muser.  
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old Febles was hitting .267 with 10 home runs and 50  
RBIs and was second in the AL with nine triples. 
</P>
<P>
	Jed Hansen started in Febles' place Saturday and Sunday and Ray  
Holbert got the start against Baltimore on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Febles said he had a similar injury in the minor leagues that  
was not as serious. Asked whether he felt frustrated, he said, 
``No. Well, maybe a little bit.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Brings Fear, Then Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARITA, Texas (AP) -- Lina Gutierrez had heard enough about how  
fortunate Texas was that Hurricane Bret took the path it did, 
through a sparse area of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were here. We're humans, too,'' Ms. Gutierrez said Monday  
in Sarita, a town of 450 people that was in the direct path of the 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Bret passed through empty ranch land, right between heavily  
populated Corpus Christi to the north and Brownsville to the south. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, Sarita is the only town  
in Kenedy County and the first one visited by the hurricane's 
powerful core after it made landfall 6 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that it took this course here,'' said Rafael Cuellar  
Jr., sheriff of Kenedy County. ``It's not as populated as 
Brownsville or Corpus Christi; it probably would have killed people 
there. In a way, it was good. We were all very lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't tell that to Jesse Salinas.  
</P>
<P>
	A ranch cowboy who weathered the storm with Ms. Gutierrez at the  
home of a neighbor, he said he was frightened by the noise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like a big jet engine was coming down on top of us.  
It was very scary,'' said Salinas, who passed the time trying to 
play cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Sarita residents took shelter in the courthouse as the  
storm traveled 25 miles to Brooks County and Falfurrias, at 5,800 
residents the largest city directly in Bret's way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm telling you, it sounded real bad,'' said David Vargas Sr.,  
who admitted he hasn't liked storms since a big one swept through 
when he was a child in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, who was making sure his Side Door Cafe was undamaged by  
the storm, said he had ``never seen or heard anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, the area escaped serious trouble. Bret had  
left Sarita and Falfurrias littered with branches and downed trees. 
Some businesses lost their roofs, and the wind toppled canopies at 
four gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
	In Falfurrias, bank president Thomas Ratliff lost nearly all the  
trees at his house but agreed that everyone was lucky Bret chose 
the route it did. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably better to hit an area like this than the big  
city, as far as dollars and cents,'' Ratliff said. ``I guess it'll 
be all right, but there will be a lot of cleanup.''

<HEADLINE> Disabled Boy Dies on Park Ride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- A disabled 12-year-old boy died after  
plummeting from an amusement park ride that was about to be shut 
down for a safety check. 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua Smurphat fell from the Drop Zone ride at Paramount's  
Great America Theme Park at 3:20 p.m. Sunday, park spokesman 
Timothy Chanaud said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Drop Zone, riders sit upright, feet dangling, in six  
separate four-person coaches, with each person locked in by a 
shoulder harness. They then are hoisted 200 feet up a tower and 
free-fall about two-thirds of the way down, reaching speeds of 62 
mph, before braking to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, the boy slipped out of his harness, park officials  
said. It wasn't immediately known how far he fell. Police and park 
officials were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Chanaud described the boy as ``severely disabled, both mentally  
and physically,'' but said the disabilities should not have 
prevented him from riding safely. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the fatal ride, a computer that helps operate the  
Drop Zone displayed an error message, forcing park officials to 
close one of the ride's cars. The entire ride was to be taken out 
of commission for the rest of the day -- but not until the final 
group of riders, including Joshua, were given their turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Chanaud said the trouble with ride had nothing to do with the  
boy's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no possible relation between that vehicle that was  
closed off and the vehicle in which the accident occurred,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ride will be closed indefinitely.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Cursing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANDISH, Mich. (AP) -- The ``cursing canoeist'' was ordered  
Monday to perform four days of community service and either pay a 
$75 fine or spend three days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Boomer, 25, let loose with a stream of a profanities  
after falling out of a canoe last summer. A nearby couple with two 
young children said they were so horrified by his barrage of blue 
words, they paddled swiftly away. The mother said she covered her 
2-year-old daughter's ears. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury convicted Boomer in June of violating an 1897 Michigan  
law against cursing in front of children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned my lesson,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But he also thought he was a scapegoat for people who have  
behaved badly along the rural waterway through the years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I am being punished by a law that not one person in a  
million in America ever thought existed,'' he said. ``I guess what 
the county basically did is made an example of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge Allen Yenior, who ordered Boomer to work in a  
child care program as community service, put the sentence on hold 
while he appeals his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	If his conviction is upheld, Boomer, a computer programmer for a  
company that makes auto assembly equipment, said he will pay the 
fine rather than go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing  
Boomer, contends his freedom of speech was violated. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he has since cleaned up his language, Boomer said,  
``I sure have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day I'm teased, every day I'm harassed, every day  
someone can't walk by without saying `watch your mouth, here's the 
cursing canoeist.' I'll hear it every day for the rest of my 
life.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Tanker Crash Kills One in Ore. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAPLETON, Ore. (AP) -- A gasoline tanker truck collided head-on  
with a pickup near the central Oregon Coast on Monday, killing one 
person and spilling about 1,500 gallons near a creek that is home 
to threatened salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the pickup was killed in the 5 a.m. crash on a  
winding state highway. The truck driver, whose tanker plunged 75 
feet down an embankment, managed to climb out with only cuts on his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
	The tanker held 11,000 gallons in two tanks, but spilled only  
about 1,500 gallons, said Jennifer Bodine, a spokeswoman for the 
Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuel saturated the soil about 150 feet from the banks of  
Knowles Creek, four miles from where it flows into the Siuslaw 
River, site of efforts to restore spawning habitat for coho salmon 
runs heavily damaged by industrial logging. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been much worse. As far as we know, none of the  
gasoline reached the creek,'' Bodine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Downstream from the wreck, gasoline could kill juvenile coho and  
chinook salmon, steelhead and sea-run cutthroat trout living in 
deep pools, said David Bayles, conservation director of the Pacific 
Rivers Council. The coho are listed as a threatened species.

<HEADLINE> Envy As Swimming Record Is Broken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- When Mary T. Meagher got word Monday that her  
18-year-old world butterfly record had been broken, envy -- not 
sadness -- was the prevailing emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Envy that the woman who broke it was 26 years old, and that she  
had retired when she was 23, even if she is amazed the mark lasted 
nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kudos to Jenny -- she was able to keep going and I wasn't,''  
Meagher, now known by her married name, Mary T. Plant, said of 
fellow American Jenny Thompson. ``I have so much respect for her. I 
tried to keep it going mentally and physically, but finally had to 
give it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson swam the 100-meter butterfly in 57.88 seconds Monday in  
Sydney, Australia, breaking the record of 57.93, set on Aug. 16, 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from the sport in 1988 following a bronze-medal  
performance in the Seoul Olympics, Meagher married former U.S. 
Olympic speedskater Mike Plant and has yet to swim competitively. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she's focused her energy into her marriage. Plant, 34,  
and her husband, now chief executive officer of the Goodwill Games, 
have two small children and live in Peachtree City, Ga., a southern 
Atlanta suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very conscious decision to leave it all behind,''  
Plant said Monday from her vacation home in Wedowee, Ala. ``My 
husband and I have seen so many athletes that never make that 
transition into real life. And to have what I have now, I consider 
myself very lucky and I'm not worried about the records falling. It 
had to happen sooner or later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson set the new mark at the Pan Pacific Championships in  
the pool in Sydney, Australia, where the 2000 Olympic meet will be 
held. And while she gained inspiration watching Plant win three 
Olympic gold medals in the 1984 Los Angeles Games, Thompson said 
watching footage of Plant's stroke on the Internet was even more 
helpful. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helped me focus on what I need to do, and it's made a  
difference,'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Louisville, Ky., native, Plant still holds the world mark in  
the 200-meter butterfly at 2:05.97, set three days before her 
100-meter record at the same Senior National Championship meet in 
Brown Deer, Wis., when she was 16. 
</P>
<P>
	And she says that even with all her medals, setting and then  
holding the marks was the highlight of a career recognized when she 
was selected to help carry the Olympic flag during opening 
ceremonies in Atlanta in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though I won in 1984, I wasn't swimming my best times,  
and as an athlete, you're No. 1 goal is to race against yourself,'' 
Plant said. ``I never got to that point again, even if I came close 
a couple of times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Plant expects her second record to last much longer.  
Another 26-year old, Australian Susie O'Neill, has come close to 
the 200-meter mark several times and could break it this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm actually pulling for her since I've met her and she's nice  
and also a bit older,'' Plant said. ``Not to put too much pressure 
on her or anything.''

<HEADLINE> Philippoussis Withdraws From Hamlet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COMMACK, N.Y. (AP) -- Mark Philippoussis withdrew from the Hamlet  
Cup on Monday because of a knee injury and may also miss the U.S. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old Australian, ranked No. 11 in the world, tore  
cartilage in his left knee during a match against Pete Sampras at 
Wimbledon in June. He had surgery in July and made his return last 
week in the RCA Championships, where he lost his first match to 
France's Arnaud DiPasquale. 
</P>
<P>
	``More time is needed for him to be ready to play again,'' said  
Dr. David Altchek. ``I would not approve him for the Hamlet Cup and 
will make a decision Friday or Saturday regarding the U.S. Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philippoussis was the second Australian to pull out of the  
Hamlet. Defending champion Patrick Rafter, who has won the U.S. 
Open twice, withdrew because of tendinitis in his right shoulder. 
Rafter is expected to compete in next week's U.S. Open.

<HEADLINE> Prices Fall Again in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Consumer prices fell at an annual rate of 5.5  
percent in July, the ninth consecutive month of deflation, as 
demand remained weak in Hong Kong's recession-plagued economy, the 
government reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census and Statistics Department said the latest drop was  
aggravated by lower taxes on properties, plus falling rents on 
housing and cheaper clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have been dropping in Hong Kong since the territory's  
once-buoyant economy was hit by the Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> $65M Doesn't Buy What It Once Did </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- Sure, $65 million doesn't buy what it once  
did. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chip Ganassi wasn't complaining. Not for the moment, anyway.  
</P>
<P>
	This was late Sunday afternoon and his planets were all in  
alignment. His rookie driver had just won a race named for his car 
team's sponsor in front of a near-sellout crowd, on a brand-new 
track that he helped build and pay for. He was surrounded by a tent 
full of well-wishers, many of them paying customers who'd made 
their way down from the grandstand to toast his victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Then someone had to go and spoil the mood by asking Ganassi how  
he was going to top it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried about next year,'' he said, tugging at the  
bill of his cap. ``I'm worried about next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are plenty of reasons why Ganassi, president of the new  
Chicago Motor Speedway, and some of the other bigshots in the 
Championship Auto Racing Teams circuit do not want to get ahead of 
themselves. Ever since the split with Indianapolis Motor Speedway 
boss Tony George in 1995, CART's future seems to be on the 
installment plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The heroes whose names people know -- A.J. Foyt, Mario Andretti,  
Al Unser, Rick Mears and Emerson Fittipaldi -- are retired. While 
attendance is steady at its road courses and street races, the 
crowds are dwindling at many of the oval tracks CART visits. 
Television ratings are slipping. CART is fighting the rival Indy 
Racing League circuit -- bankrolled by George -- for the open-wheel 
racing crowd and all the while, NASCAR is poaching fans from both. 
</P>
<P>
	The future is anything but assured. Though they've met several  
times about ending the split, so far the CART-IRL people have been 
much better at waging war than making peace. But for a little while 
at least, all those concerns got shoved into the background. 
</P>
<P>
	The circuit was bringing Indy-car racing back to one of the  
nation's biggest market for the first time in 80 years. And even 
better, CART was opening for business in the area some two years 
before a nearby IRL-backed racetrack would be able to stage its 
first race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Motor Speedway is what the drivers like to call ``a  
clean sheet of paper,'' meaning nobody knows exactly how to run on 
it. It's a 1-mile oval, 70 feet wide in the straightaways and 80 
feet in the turns, generous enough to let three cars battle for 
position on the turns. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it mattered most, Michael Andretti, Mario's son and  
arguably the best-known name on the CART circuit, and Paul Tracy 
crashed heading into the third turn on lap 99. 
</P>
<P>
	Both drivers escaped serious injury, but Tracy's nickname on the  
circuit, ``Captain Crunch,'' says everything you need to know about 
who was at fault. 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti has tangled with him before, which explained why he  
began an interview with ABC this way: ``Normal Paul Tracy driving. 
He's going to kill someone out there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a shame. We both had a good race going and he puts  
me down. I had nowhere to go. I can't believe what he did. Why? 
What is he thinking? I don't understand? Does he have a death wish? 
Is he trying to kill us both? I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, the only thing Tracy endangered was the fans'  
interest. Since CART no longer offers the star-studded fields of 
just a few years ago, taking out one of its few recognizable names 
was not a good thing. Especially since Al Unser Jr. -- who still has 
the name, if not the driving skills -- ended his day 35 laps earlier 
by pulling into the infield grass with an engine belching like a 
small smokestack. 
</P>
<P>
	Then an interesting thing happened. The race only improved.  
Ganassi's rookie driver, Juan Montoya of Columbia, grabbed the lead 
on lap 127 and played a very entertaining game of cat-and-mouse the 
rest of the way with Dario Franchitti and Jimmy Vasser, who 
finished second and third. It would have been more entertaining, 
except that a few cars not on the lead lap inserted themselves 
between the contenders at various junctures and made for some 
maddening missed chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, everything about the show -- the drivers, the product,  
the backdrop -- was big league. That was not lost of Indy boss 
George, who showed up Friday and got a tour of the new facility 
from Ganassi himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what was discussed, Ganassi replied, ``Nothing -- and  
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been friends for 20 years,'' he went on. ``The sad thing  
about feuds are that they make people choose sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is rumored to be another high-level meeting between CART  
and the IRL at midweek. That makes the new, $65 million racetrack 
either a bargaining chip in peace talks or a very reckless gamble. 
And Ganassi removes any doubt about which he thinks it is in a 
heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows this sport needs to be put back together,'' he  
said, tugging at the bill of his cap again. ``Everybody.''

<HEADLINE> CP&AMP;L To Merge With Florida Utility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH (AP) -- Carolina Power &AMP; Light Co. is buying Florida  
Progress Corp. for cash and stock worth $5.3 billion in a deal that 
will create the ninth-largest electric utility in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced Monday was approved over the weekend by  
the boards of directors at both companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal must also be approved by state regulators in the  
Carolinas as well as several federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	CP&AMP;L is buying Florida Progress at a premium, paying  
shareholders of the St. Petersburg-based utility $54 for each share 
of common stock -- 21 percent above Florida Progress's closing price 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the biggest acquisition in CP&AMP;L history, making the  
Raleigh-based gas and electricity provider a key player in the 
booming Southeastern energy market. 
</P>
<P>
	The new holding company will have 2.5 million customers in three  
states and total revenue of about $6.7 billion, based on 1998 
figures. The two utilities expect the merger to translate into 
savings of more than $100 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives us the size and the scope we need to be successful  
in the future,'' said William Cavanaugh, CP&AMP;L's chairman, president 
and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will enable us to increase earnings at a rate of 7 to 8  
percent, and we will be operating in one of the best areas in the 
country the Carolinas and Florida,'' he said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,250 positions will be cut as a result of the merger,  
Cavanaugh said. The reductions will affect both companies, he said. 
Employees were to be told about the merger today. 
</P>
<P>
	CP&AMP;L employs 7,650 -- a number that includes positions at N.C.  
Natural Gas Corp., the company CP&AMP;L acquired last month. Florida 
Progress has 9,600 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The new corporation, a yet-to-be-named holding company under  
which CP&AMP;L and its other businesses will be organized as 
subsidiaries, will eventually have 16,000 employees, a total 
reduction of around 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	About 44 percent of the job cuts will come from overlapping  
functions, including support services, accounting, treasury and 
legal services, Cavanaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the company will try to scale back its employment numbers  
in coming months, there will be no layoffs until the merger has 
been completed next summer, CP&AMP;L said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will try to manage this downsizing through attrition,''  
Cavanaugh told the newspaper. ``It will be in the interest of both 
companies to manage the company such that we can minimize the 
amount of actual employees who lose their jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cavanaugh, 60, will lead the new company as chairman, president  
and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Korpan, the head of Florida Progress, will retire as  
that company ceases to exist. He will serve on the board of the new 
holding company, which will be controlled by CP&AMP;L. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Power Corp., the electric subsidiary of Florida  
Progress, will still be based in St. Petersburg. The license of its 
nuclear plant, Crystal River, will be transferred to CP&AMP;L pending 
approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``This impacts a wide range of people and interests, including  
North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida ratepayers, shareholders 
and employees,'' said Jo Anne Sanford, chairwoman of the North 
Carolina Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our review will focus on whether the action is justified by  
public convenience and necessity, and we look at these mergers to 
determine whether there's any adverse impact on ratepayers,'' 
Sanford said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Injunction Reconsidered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court ordered  
reconsideration Monday of a judge's restrictions against shipments 
by Microsoft Corp. of software containing Java programming 
language. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte of San Jose granted an  
injunction to Sun Microsystems last November. He said Sun was 
likely to show that Microsoft had violated a licensing agreement 
allowing it to use Sun's version of Java in its products. 
</P>
<P>
	The injunction prohibited Microsoft from distributing products  
that used Sun's Java copyrights, including Windows 98 and Internet 
Explorer 4.0, unless Microsoft conformed to Sun's standards for 
Java. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that there  
was evidence to support Whyte's conclusion that Microsoft had 
violated the agreement by designing a version of Java incompatible 
with other software. But the court also said Whyte failed to 
explain why the alleged violation was a copyright infringement, 
rather than a breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The distinction is important. A contract violation can justify  
an injunction against product shipments only if the innocent party 
can show it is being harmed. Otherwise, it must allow the 
shipments, then sue for damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Java, introduced by Sun in 1995, allows developers to write a  
software application once and have it run on a variety of 
computers, regardless of the underlying system. Sun has tried to 
promote its form of Java as a universal programming language. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ordered the injunction lifted, but its ruling does not  
take effect immediately. Sun can ask Whyte to restore the 
injunction while he reconsiders the dispute.

<HEADLINE>  Hurricane Bret Hits Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- Hurricane Bret, the biggest storm  
to hit Texas in nearly 20 years, roared ashore Sunday with 
horizontal sheets of rain and 125-mph winds that whipped and bent 
palm trees and forced thousands of people to flee inland. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapidly developing storm made landfall about 6 p.m. in  
sparsely populated Kenedy County, about 70 miles south of Corpus 
Christi. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities reported no injuries in the hours after the storm  
hit land. No major damage was apparent as the storm moved inland 
Sunday night, but there was no word about largely unpopulated areas 
directly in the hurricane's path. The population of Kenedy County 
is 458. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Sunday, winds dropped to 105 mph and extended 30 miles out  
from the storm. Bret continued moving west at 7 mph, and 
forecasters expected it to decrease in strength overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're definitely not disappointed. We're very thankful,'' said  
meteorologist Mark Lenz. ``The eye crossed the coastline in one 
county along the Texas coast that was the least populated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 4 inches of rain fell on Corpus Christi and the  
downtown area was littered with tree limbs and palm leaves. Strong 
winds shred canvas awnings, rattled windows and whipped through 
parking garages. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters had warned about tornadoes spawned by the storm, a  
foot or more of rain and a storm surge that could approach 25 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Jim Hoke of the National Weather Service  
said the storm had ``clear potential of producing major disaster'' 
and compared the storm with Hurricane Andrew, which battered 
Florida in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike Andrew, which hit densely populated South Florida,  
Bret hit between Corpus Christi (population of 300,000) and 
Brownsville (132,000). 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that the core of the hurricane ... is not  
over the more populated areas,'' said Max Mayfield of the National 
Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The path resembles that of 1980's Hurricane Allen, which packed  
winds of 185 mph and did $55 million in property damage but killed 
only two people when it came ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	Palm trees whipped as the wind strengthened in early afternoon  
and Corpus Christi Bay was covered with whitecaps as the Category 4 
storm came ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	As the storm hit, some people braved driving rain and rolling  
surf to walk on Corpus Christi beaches. A few even grabbed 
surfboards or swam. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina DeLeon, 23, was on the beach with her husband, Jesus,  
making a videotape of the storm for their unborn daughter, Zara, 
who is due in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``She'll probably say, 'Mom, you're crazy,'' Carolina DeLeon  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corpus Christi declared a state of disaster and called for a  
general but voluntary evacuation of the city, said city spokesman 
Ted Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are really trying to drive home the point that we take this  
very seriously,'' Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuation was ``proceeding in an orderly fashion,'' Corpus  
Christi City Manager David Garcia said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency officials in San Antonio set up shelters at Lackland  
Air Force Base in anticipation of thousands of fleeing residents. 
Families pouring into shelters were told to bring only what they 
needed because of cramped quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Many San Antonio hotels offered lowered evacuee rates with proof  
of residence. 
</P>
<P>
	Like monstrous Hurricane Allen, Bret hit one of the state's  
least populated areas, the ranch land of Kleberg and Kenedy 
counties between Brownsville and Corpus Christi. However, tropical 
storm-force winds of up to 73 mph extended more than 100 miles 
outward from the center, the National Hurricane Center said. 
</P>
<P>
	The King Ranch occupies much of Kenedy and Kleberg counties.  
Ranch president Jack Hunt said about 50 people had been evacuated 
but there was no way to protect about 55,000 head of cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cattle will just have to ride it out,'' Hunt said. ``It's  
not practical to move them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most residents had left coastal Padre and Mustang islands, where  
a mandatory order was issued and police went door-to-door urging 
people to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush said he would sign disaster proclamations  
for seven counties. President Clinton made federal disaster 
resources available Sunday after the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency submitted an analysis of the state's request for aid. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 a.m. EDT, the center of Bret was located about 60 miles  
south-southwest of Corpus Christi and 70 miles north-northwest of 
Brownsville. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas hadn't been hit by a hurricane since Hurricane Jerry  
killed three people in October 1989. However, the state's 
367-mile-long coast has been struck by tropical storms since then, 
including Charley, which dumped 18 inches of rain and killed 19 
people in August 1998.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Hooked on Caller ID, Etc. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rebecca Ryen hears the ring, ring of the  
telephone and lunges for the receiver eager to hear a friendly 
voice at the other end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
	But then she pauses and checks her Caller ID box to find out if  
it will be a friendly voice after all. 
</P>
<P>
	``When 'unavailable' comes across, it's either a phone company  
or a bill collector,'' said Ryen of Bethesda, Md. ``And that means 
I don't answer it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She is among millions of phone users hooked on technology that  
gives them information before, after and during calls. A study of 
consumer behavior by Arbitron NewMedia found that Caller ID 
customers have quadrupled over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a never-ending source of amazement how much customers  
love these things,'' said Terry Yarbrough, senior director of 
product management at BellSouth, where more than 40 percent of the 
company's customers have Caller ID and 35 percent either use or 
subscribe to Call Return, activated by dialing 69 to trace the last 
incoming call. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC Communications' Southwestern Bell, the main provider of  
local phone service in Texas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and 
Arkansas, boasts an even higher Caller ID rate: More than half of 
their customers have the feature, with 70 percent subscribing in 
Laredo, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone companies are responding to demand by developing new  
features. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest example: Bell Atlantic's Call 54, which enables  
people to find out the name and address that corresponds to a local 
phone number, as long as both the name and address are listed. To 
get the information, a person calls 555-5454 and then dials in the 
phone number. A recorded voice reads the name and address, and even 
offers to spell them. 
</P>
<P>
	This service is a response to the growth of Internet and CD-Rom  
search services, say company officials. With Call 54, consumers can 
look up three listings for one 75-cent call. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its introduction in 1995 in New Jersey -- followed by  
rollouts in Maryland, West Virginia and parts of northern Virginia 
-- more than 10 million addresses have been handed out. 
</P>
<P>
	The service leaves out all non-published information. Others can  
request that their information be removed from the database. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy groups say these phone features can put those who want  
to safeguard their home numbers and addresses at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these services can be extremely problematic to people  
who have to protect their security in their home,'' said Beth 
Givens, director of the San Diego-based Privacy Rights 
Clearinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
	With some features, the burden is on the callers to ``opt out''  
of being identified by blocking their number or calling through an 
operator, privacy advocates point out. 
</P>
<P>
	``These services show how users of all kinds of communications  
systems need to be aware of what they are unwittingly consenting 
to,'' said Jim Dempsey, senior staff counsel at the Center for 
Democracy and Technology, a Washington-based privacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	The cat-and-mouse technology game can get harried: To dodge the  
Caller ID system, a caller can activate a feature to block the 
number and have it show up as ``Unavailable'' or ``Anonymous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phone users can one-up the clever caller by blocking calls from  
certain numbers. BellSouth, for example, offers a message rejecting 
blocked calls but inviting callers to ring again without a blocked 
number. Ameritech's Privacy Manager, introduced last year, 
intercepts unknown callers and asks for identification. The 
recipient then can hear a recording identifying the caller and opt 
to accept or decline the call and have the Privacy Manager tell the 
caller not to call again. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Call Waiting, the veritable grandfather of phone features,  
is getting a makeover: A deluxe version lets people use Caller ID 
in conjunction with Call Waiting. Other phone carriers offer a 
version for Internet users that flashes the incoming number on the 
computer screen. With a point and click, customers can opt to 
disconnect from the Internet and take the call or send the call 
into voicemail. 
</P>
<P>
	Such advances could redefine what consumers consider phone  
must-haves. In ``deprivation'' studies conducted by SBC, customers 
in focus groups revealed their dependency when their phone services 
were taken away. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people just felt like they had no friends'' because  
they didn't know who had called, said B.J. Mamuzic, senior director 
of consumer marketing. ``Some of them felt insecure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryen admits she's addicted to her Caller ID. She once pulled the  
batteries out of her fire alarm to keep the gadget running. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to get it because everybody else had it,'' said Ryen.  
``Now I can't live without it.''

<HEADLINE> A tale of 2 QBs: Bledsoe, Beuerlein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Carolina incumbent Steve Beuerlein is still in there, trying to  
win the quarterback job with the Panthers. Drew Bledsoe, meanwhile, 
has things well in hand with the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't taken long for Bledsoe to remind the Patriots what he  
can do with a full -- and healthy -- stable of wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Patriots' 34-14 victory over the Cowboys on Saturday  
night, a healthy Terry Glenn caught five passes for 85 yards and a 
touchdown. An injury-free Troy Brown was once again a key target 
for Bledsoe on third down. Even Vincent Brisby, who missed much of 
last season with a broken finger, added a reception late in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we have our full complement of weapons, we have a very  
dangerous offense. I expect us to score some points this year,'' 
Bledsoe said after he finished 13-of-19 for 147 yards and two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina coach George Seifert, meanwhile, appears to be  
uncomfortable talking about the quarterback competition with the 
Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after Seifert got solid performances from Beuerlein,  
Jeff Lewis and Dameyune Craig in Friday night's 20-13 victory over 
Pittsburgh, the Panthers' first-year coach wasn't interested in 
discussing their status with the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert declined to reveal whether Beuerlein would work with the  
first-team offense in the Panthers' next exhibition Friday night in 
Baltimore. And Seifert cautioned reporters against reading too much 
into his refusal to announce a starter for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't say that Beuerlein's not going to start -- please,'' he  
said. ``Right now we're just looking at all the different 
scenarios.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *Steelers    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie linebacker Joey Porter needed only two exhibition games  
to supply some pressure -- not only on opposing quarterbacks, but 
also on the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, a backup to right outside linebacker Carlos Emmons,  
continued a good training camp with two sacks Friday in the 
Steelers' 20-13 exhibition loss to Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is starting to become a little more comfortable in this  
system,'' Steelers coach Bill Cowher said. ``You can see he is an 
athlete. He can run, and you can't teach that. Once he starts 
feeling more comfortable, he is the type of guy who can make some 
plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
                               *Jets    	
</P>
<P>
	New York coach Bill Parcells terminated the contract of  
quarterback Scott Zolak on Sunday, effectively handing the team's 
backup job to newly acquired Rick Mirer. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came two days after the club obtained Mirer from the  
Packers for a conditional selection in next year's draft. Zolak, a 
nine-year veteran in his first year with the Jets, played poorly in 
Friday night's 10-9 preseason win over the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a better opportunity for him to let him go now,''  
Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Bengals    	
</P>
<P>
	Safety Kelvin Moore was in stable condition at a hospital in  
Pontiac, Mich., two days after he broke a vertebra in his neck 
while making a tackle in an exhibition game against the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore has feeling in his arms and legs and is expected to make  
``an excellent recovery,'' team Dr. Robert Heidt Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching film of the play, coach Bruce Coslet said Moore  
did everything right and still got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like he was a little bit stumbling into him and just  
bent his head back,'' Coslet said. ``It just happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals, meanwhile, waived wide receiver Tommy Boyd and  
defensive end Donald Broomfield, both of whom played in the team's 
two exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	The hamstring injury that cornerback Jason Sehorn suffered a  
week before training camp continues to heal slowly and he will miss 
another week or two, according to coach Jim Fassel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn had an MRI on Friday and doctors decided not to let him  
run this week, Fassel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although he is just striding and things, they just want to  
make sure he completely rests it,'' Fassel said. ``So we are going 
to take him off the running.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	Miami's main goal in training camp was to upgrade an offense  
that ranked 16th in the NFL last season. Midway through the 
exhibition schedule, there's scant evidence of progress. 
</P>
<P>
	The first team failed to produce a first down in the exhibition  
opener against New Orleans, and in Saturday night's 13-10 victory 
at San Diego, Miami managed just one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Colts    	
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long for Edgerrin James to make an impact for  
Indianapolis. The rookie, playing in the first half, rushed for 77 
yards on 10 carries and scored on runs of 16 and 12 yards as the 
Colts beat New Orleans 37-7 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Edgerrin really showed why we picked him so high,'' Colts  
coach Jim Mora said. ``He gave us a spark and showed what he can 
do. He looks like the real deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts took James as the fourth overall draft pick, one spot  
ahead of the Saints, who took Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams.

<HEADLINE>  China Jet Landing Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- After a China Airlines jet crashed and flipped  
over while trying to land, questions arose today about why a plane 
was landing in the midst of a typhoon that shut down ferries, most 
buses and some roads. Two people were killed in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwan carrier's Flight CI642 from Bangkok dipped sharply  
before its right wing struck the runway, bouncing the plane onto 
its back as it burst into flames. There was a loud blast, and 
suddenly everyone was dangling upside down inside the burning jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty people were hospitalized today, eight in critical or  
serious condition. Of the 313 people who survived the crash, 102 
walked away uninjured and another 151 were quickly discharged from 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed were a Taiwanese man and a Portuguese woman. The women  
was with a 78-member tour group from Portugal that had just spent 
five days vacationing on a tropical island in Thailand. Four 
Americans were also on board. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the explosion, the fire, coming all the way from the  
front of the plane to the rear,'' said one of the survivors, Joemy 
Tam. Eyewitnesses described a fireball on the ground, several times 
longer than the MD-11 jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
	Stunned passengers, some burned, screamed as they freed  
themselves from their seats and made their way out onto a runway 
drenched with jet fuel. They had to jump out of the doors because 
the emergency evacuation slides were useless with the jet upside 
down, its landing gear pointing to the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident raised questions about why airplanes were trying to  
land in the middle of a typhoon.

	Saudi oilman Hassan Al-Husseini flew into Hong Kong earlier from  
Shanghai and was waiting inside the airport for another flight to 
Dubai when he saw the plane crash. Despite severe turbulence on his 
flight to Hong Kong, he said, officials showed a ``lack of 
concern'' about the weather until the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shouldn't they have canceled our flight or turned us back?''  
Al-Husseini asked today. ``It seems like it's a little bit of a 
cowboy situation. The pilot must decide whether to take a risk on 
taking off or landing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong aviation officials said they were following accepted  
international procedures when they left Chek Lap Kok airport open 
Sunday during Tropical Storm Sam, adding that it was up to airlines 
to decide whether to attempt a landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Lam, director of Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department,  
said Hong Kong air traffic controllers did their duty by advising 
China Airlines on the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The typhoon warning signals that closed much of Hong Kong have  
``no direct relation to whether or not the airplanes can land,'' 
Lam told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But Billy Lam, the chief executive of the territory's Airport  
Authority, said earlier today: ``We will certainly try to review 
the situation in light of the experience gained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China Airlines suffered more weather-related problems early  
today. A flight from Taipei, carrying relatives of crash victims 
and Taiwanese aviation and air safety experts, was forced back by 
heavy fog in Hong Kong. After a delay of almost six hours, the jet 
departed again but had to turn back a second time in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather had been a concern even before Flight CI642 left  
Bangkok, but the winds appeared to have calmed around Hong Kong, so 
the pilot decided to land, Taiwanese officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong authorities have begun sifting through the charred  
wreckage to try to figure out what went wrong. They were recovering 
the ``black box'' cockpit recorders, which they will send Britain 
for experts to examine. 
</P>
<P>
	China Airlines executives appeared devastated by the crash,  
which followed a massive shake-up in pilot training and management 
as the carrier tries to become safer after several crashes in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the reform effort has gone into changing the ``cockpit  
culture,'' because most China Airlines pilots have military 
backgrounds -- something the airline felt led to too much autocratic 
decision-making. Pilot mistakes were blamed for crashes in 1994 and 
1998. More expatriate pilots were hired as the airline's fleet 
expanded and modernized. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the pilot of the jet that crashed Sunday was an  
expatriate, which could dampen accusations of institutional pilot 
training problems.

<HEADLINE> Report: Woods, Nike in New Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tiger Woods is restructuring his contract with Nike to more than  
double its current value, paying him between $80 million and $90 
million in the next five years, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike's decision to renegotiate the deal was accelerated by two  
of his TV commercials -- including one depicting Woods bouncing a 
golf ball off a club head, Golf World magazine reported in its Aug. 
27 editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods' original five-year contract with Beaverton, Ore.-based  
Nike, signed in 1996, was for $40 million. Since signing that 
eye-popping deal, Woods won the 1997 Masters and this year's PGA 
Championship, reached the world No. 1 ranking and raised public 
consciousness about the sport of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods also has a contract with Titleist to play its clubs and  
balls, and Titleist officials felt the TV spots created the 
impression that Woods was endorsing Nike's golf ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Titleist sued Nike on June 25 in U.S. District Court in Boston,  
alleging the ads violate Woods' exclusive contract to endorse 
Titleist balls and clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Golf World also quoted unidentified sources at Titleist as  
saying that the Fairhaven, Mass.-based company will cut its 
financial obligation to Woods in half, to $2 million a year, and 
will no longer have its name on his golf bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Steinberg, who handles Woods' affairs for International  
Management Group, told the magazine that the conflict between Nike 
and Titleist over the ads was the impetus for both deals to be 
restructured. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would have been renewal talks in the next eight to 12  
months anyway, but this way there are no lawsuits and no damage to 
Tiger Woods, Nike or Titleist,'' Steinberg told Golf World. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine quoted the Titleist sources as saying the company  
long felt it wasn't getting enough exposure for the money it was 
paying Woods because his hat and shirt contain either the Nike 
swoosh or the logo of his clothing line. 
</P>
<P>
	Golf World also reported that American Express or Rolex are  
likely contenders to replace Titleist as the name on Woods' golf 
bag.

<HEADLINE>  China Jet Landing Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- After a China Airlines jet crashed and flipped  
over while trying to land, questions arose today about why a plane 
was landing in the midst of a typhoon that shut down ferries, most 
buses and some roads. Two people were killed in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwan carrier's Flight CI642 from Bangkok dipped sharply  
before its right wing struck the runway, bouncing the plane onto 
its back as it burst into flames. There was a loud blast, and 
suddenly everyone was dangling upside down inside the burning jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty people were hospitalized today, eight in critical or  
serious condition. Of the 313 people who survived the crash, 102 
walked away uninjured and another 151 were quickly discharged from 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed were a Taiwanese man and a Portuguese woman. The women  
was with a 78-member tour group from Portugal that had just spent 
five days vacationing on a tropical island in Thailand. Four 
Americans were also on board. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the explosion, the fire, coming all the way from the  
front of the plane to the rear,'' said one of the survivors, Joemy 
Tam. Eyewitnesses described a fireball on the ground, several times 
longer than the MD-11 jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
	Stunned passengers, some burned, screamed as they freed  
themselves from their seats and made their way out onto a runway 
drenched with jet fuel. They had to jump out of the doors because 
the emergency evacuation slides were useless with the jet upside 
down, its landing gear pointing to the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident raised questions about why airplanes were trying to  
land in the middle of a typhoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi oilman Hassan Al-Husseini flew into Hong Kong earlier from

<HEADLINE> Corpus Christi Escapes Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- Shops and restaurants shut down,  
residents boarded up their homes and thousands fled inland as 
Corpus Christi braced for the worst of Hurricane Bret. 
</P>
<P>
	As Bret arrived, wind whipped palm trees, littering streets with  
torn leaves. Canvas awnings on downtown buildings were shredded and 
flapped wildly in the gusts. Horizontal sheets of rain soaked the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	But residents breathed a sign of relief when it turned out a  
rural area 70 miles to the south -- not this populated coastal city 
-- was the storm's main target. 
</P>
<P>
	Though many schools were closed in and around Corpus Christi  
today, city employees were told to report to work as usual as 
officials anticipated few major problems in the aftermath of the 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumper-to-bumper traffic had clogged northbound Interstate 37  
for about 45 miles leading from the city Sunday. Traffic was heavy 
all the way to San Antonio -- 145 miles away -- where the American 
Red Cross set up evacuation shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Air Force base in San Antonio opened its empty barracks to  
5,000 people forced out of the Corpus Christi Naval Air station, 
and hundreds of mentally handicapped people packed into vans and 
were driven from the Corpus Christi State School. 
</P>
<P>
	By late Sunday night, the wear and tear of a long day on the  
road was evident on the faces of people who continued streaming 
into John Jay High School in San Antonio, one of 10 shelters 
expected to house 3,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Some headed for the percolating coffee pot or a spot in front of  
the only television. Early on, the cafeteria served hot food which 
eventually gave way to ham and cheese sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
	Weary travelers, young and old, curled up on the mats -- too  
short for most to stretch their legs -- and pulled blankets over 
their eyes to shield against the fluorescent lights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have all the comforts, but it's nice and clean and we  
have air conditioning and a place to sleep,'' said John Jay 
Assistant Principal Kathy Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	Nora Webb of Corpus Christi said she and nine family members  
packed into two cars and drove more than five hours to San Antonio, 
a drive she said normally takes two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some of her family retreated immediately to the floor  
mats to catch some sleep, Ms. Webb said she planned to stay up late 
watching weather updates on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't know what to expect,'' Ms. Webb said as she  
unpacked blankets and pillows from her car. ``My dad and my brother 
stayed over and I'm a little worried. They stayed to board up the 
house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the San Antonio's hotels offered reduced evacuee rates  
with proof of residence in the coastal region, Bexar County 
emergency operations spokeswoman Suzanne Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blanca Ramos and Christian Acosta fled Aransas Pass as the storm  
encroached Sunday morning. They left at 5 a.m., helped another 
family get out and finally reached San Antonio about 13 hours 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sky was completely black in the rearview mirror,'' Ms.  
Ramos said, resting her face on her hand as she watched her 
4-year-old daughter, Crystal, munch on a cold sandwich and chips. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just slept through the whole ride. She just knows there's  
a big thunderstorm,'' she said. ``I don't know if we'll find 
anything when we get home. It's just really sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few wished they had never left.  
</P>
<P>
	After looking for shelter in hotel rooms for six hours, Paula  
and Dave Williams, who had packed full two trucks, including two 
cats, had enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding no lodging, they were going home to Corpus Christi. They  
pulled into a gas station south of San Antonio to refuel, feed the 
cats and stretch their legs before driving back into the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may get blown around or whatever,'' Dave Williams said.  
``We're going home.''

<HEADLINE> CP&AMP;L To Merge With Florida Utility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Carolina Power &AMP; Light Co. will acquire  
Florida Progress Corp. for $5.3 billion, creating the nation's 
ninth-largest electric utility. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives us the size and the scope we need to be successful  
in the future,'' said William Cavanaugh, CP&AMP;L's chairman, president 
and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	CP&AMP;L will create a holding company to operate the utilities,  
Carolina Power and Florida Power, as subsidiaries. The merged 
company will have a generating capacity of 18,500 megawatts, 
revenues of $6.7 billion and 2.5 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The two utilities expect the merger to translate into savings of  
more than $100 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	CP&AMP;L is buying Florida Progress at a premium, paying  
shareholders of the St. Petersburg-based utility $54 for each share 
of common stock -- 21 percent above Florida Progress' closing price 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced Monday was approved over the weekend by  
the boards of directors at both companies. The deal, which also 
includes CP&AMP;L taking over $2.7 billion in debt, must be approved by 
state regulators in the Carolinas as well as several federal 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,250 positions, or 7 percent of the total work force --  
will be cut as a result of the merger, with most of the cuts coming 
largely through attrition, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the combination looked like a good match between  
two regional utilities whose peak generating periods don't overlap 
and who have complementary residential and industrial customers 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raleigh-based CP&AMP;L has more business and industrial  
customers and the St. Petersburg, Fla.-based utility has more 
residential customers, both in high-growth states. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the public will get are financially stronger utilities  
and utilities that will be able to keep the prices frozen for a 
long period because of the strength they get from the merger,'' 
said Barry Abramson, a utility stock analyst with PaineWebber in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The utilities ``also see that deregulation is coming eventually  
and they know that size and scope is going to be very important,'' 
Abramson said. ``It's better to prepare yourself early for 
something that is going to happen. ...The Southeastern states are 
way behind the other states in implementing utility deregulation. 
Regulators don't feel a pressing need because they already have low 
rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cavanaugh, 60, will lead the new company as chairman, president  
and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Korpan, the head of Florida Progress, will retire as  
that company ceases to exist. He will serve on the board of the new 
holding company. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Power Corp., the electric subsidiary of Florida  
Progress, will still be based in St. Petersburg. The license of its 
nuclear plant, Crystal River, will be transferred to CP&AMP;L pending 
approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Hamlin, an analyst with First Union Capital Markets, said  
Florida Power will benefit from CP&AMP;L's expertise in operating 
nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``As competition comes, customers will always be better served  
by having more efficient power suppliers,'' Hamlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors pushed Florida Progress' stock up 5 percent, or $2.18 3/4  
to $46.81 1/4, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. CP&AMP;L's 
shares sagged 6 percent, falling $2.31 1/4 to $36.68 3/4.

<HEADLINE> Benihana Founder Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A former athlete and founder of the Japanese  
steakhouse chain Benihana Inc. pleaded guilty Monday to making 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in an insider trading scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing in Brooklyn federal court, a frail-looking Rocky Aoki  
admitted receiving an illegal tip that then-Apple Computer Inc. 
Chairman John Scully was negotiating to join a company called 
Spectrum. Based on that, Aoki said he bought 125,000 shares of 
Spectrum, then -- after Scully's appointment was announced -- sold 
them a month later for a profit of nearly $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what I did violated the law,'' said Aoki, who faces up  
to 18 months in prison. ``I regret my participation in these 
activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had alleged Aoki transferred $10,000 into a  
brokerage account of a Spectrum consultant in exchange for the 
inside information. But Aoki did not admit making a payoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Aoki, 60, also told Magistrate Marilyn Dolan Go he is being  
treated for both hepatitis and diabetes. A one-time Olympic 
wrestler, Aoki was part of a crew in 1981 that became the first to 
fly a balloon across the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Aoki resigned as chairman and chief executive officer  
of the Miami-based Benihana chain after learning he was the target 
of a federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	No sentencing date was set.

<HEADLINE> Greene Chasing 3 Golds at Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Maurice Greene has T-shirts emblazoned  
with his self-proclaimed nickname, ``the phonoMOnon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's phenomenon, but with the MO for Maurice,'' Greene said,  
noting he eliminated all the ``e's'' from the word, using the odd 
spelling because the normal one already was taken. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday night, Greene was phenomenal.  
</P>
<P>
	Blazing down the Olympic Stadium track at the World  
Championships, the 25-year-old ran the second-fastest time in 
history to win the 100 meters in 9.80 seconds, just .01 off his 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two months ago, the fun-loving Greene, who bounces around  
with a boxer's shuffle, moving his shoulders from side-to-side, 
clipped .05 seconds off Donovan Bailey's 1996 world record by 
running 9.79 at Athens, Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	Athens was where Greene put his stamp on track and field. There,  
he beat a bitter Bailey in 9.86, only .02 seconds off the 
Canadian's world record, at the 1997 World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The muscular 5-foot-9, 165-pound Greene had fulfilled coach John  
Smith's goal in a master plan that would carry his bouncy sprinter 
to the title of ``World's Fastest Human.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the world record-holder at 440 yards -- a distance no  
longer being run -- is a great molder of sprinters and saw something 
special in Greene when he first began tutoring him in September 
1996. That feeling has not wavered. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a great work ethic and attitude,'' Smith said after  
Greene's first world title. ``He put himself in the position of 
becoming a world champion. That didn't surprise me. He knew how to 
prepare himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene began preparing himself when he was a teen-ager.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in high school, I used to see track and field on  
TV,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Schlagle High School in Kansas City, Kan., Greene won three  
consecutive 100 and 200 state division titles. At Kansas City 
Junior College, he pulled a hamstring muscle, delaying his 
progress. Later, he spent a brief time at Park College in 
Parksville, Mo., before returning to his coach from his age group 
and high school days, Al Hobson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started coaching Maurice when he was beating all the kids in  
the neighborhood,'' Hobson said. ``We went to age group meets when 
he was 8 years old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not long after reuniting with Hobson, Greene left. He was  
looking for a different approach, and he got it in the 
strong-willed Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always knew I was fast, but I needed new inspiration,''  
Greene said. ``Hobson taught me everything, but it was time to move 
on, to develop my running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Smith, Greene's concentration became more focused. Greene  
also had the luxury of training with two of the world's top 
sprinters, Jon Drummond and Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago, the 
1997 world 200-meter champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Smith, Greene showed his potential to be a  
world-class sprinter, beating Carl Lewis in a wind-aided 9.88 at 
the 1995 Texas Relays, an early season meet. He then finished 
second at the USA Championships and earned a berth on the U.S. team 
for the World Championships, but didn't get through the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene failed to qualify for the 1996 Olympic team, then decided  
to go with Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were swift. Greene won the U.S. championship in 1997  
at 9.90 and matched that time twice at the World Championships 
before toppling Bailey at Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Greene twice broke the world indoor record for 60  
meters, won the Goodwill Games 100 and was ranked No. 1 in the 
world after running under 10 seconds 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	He began this year by winning the world indoor title at 60  
meters, and has been consistently under 10 seconds outdoors, capped 
by his run Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maurice knows how to compete,'' Smith said. ``His biggest  
asset is that he isn't cowed by competition. On game day, he loves 
to match up against the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, there isn't anyone better than Greene.  
</P>
<P>
	He's phenomenal.

<HEADLINE> Panthers' Biakabutuka Sidelined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) -- For the second time in as many days,  
Tshimanga Biakabutuka was unable to get through a practice at the 
Carolina Panthers' training camp Monday because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest problems involve the same knee Biakabutuka injured  
shortly after the Panthers made the running back their top draft 
choice in 1996. A torn left anterior cruciate ligament four games 
into his rookie year required season-ending surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest injury kept Biakabutuka from finishing Monday  
morning's nearly two-hour practice at Wofford College, but he said 
it was nothing more than a bruise. He said he planned on being back 
in the lineup in time for Carolina's next exhibition Saturday night 
in Baltimore against the Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't put a lot of weight on it right now,'' he said. ``But  
I should be all right for the game. I'll be ready to go Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biakabutuka's latest knee problems occurred on a day when two  
other Carolina starters were sidelined by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Jason Peter, who returned early last week after  
missing several days with a hip flexor problem, left Monday 
morning's workout when the trouble resurfaced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe it's a long-range type of thing,'' coach  
George Seifert said. ``At this point I still expect that he'd 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And rookie starting offensive tackle Chris Terry, who left  
Sunday morning's practice with a slightly pinched shoulder nerve 
but returned for the second of the day's workouts, watched from the 
sidelines Monday. Seifert said Terry's injury also was not believed 
to be serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Biakabutuka, however, appeared to be experiencing considerable  
discomfort when he limped off the practice field Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The original injury occurred Sunday morning when Biakabutuka and  
safety Michael Scurlock collided head-on and banged knees with each 
other. Biakabutuka missed most of the remainder of the morning 
practice and then sat out the afternoon session. 
</P>
<P>
	Biakabutuka spent the first part of the Monday morning practice  
working with trainers to stretch out his left leg, but when he 
joined his teammates, he didn't last long. Biakabutuka banged the 
knee again on his second play, and he spent the rest of the 
practice watching from the sidelines as he walked with a pronounced 
limp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a lot of swelling in my knee,'' he said. ``It's just  
stiff. Basically I can't bend my leg right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert said the Panthers' trainers told him Biakabutuka  
probably would be ready to play against Baltimore. His return would 
be a boost to a group of running backs already thinned by the loss 
of Anthony Johnson to a toe injury and Chris Hetherington to a 
shoulder bruise.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Mills Overcomes Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Ernie Mills lifts his jersey to  
reveal a tight blue pad around his torso, an elastic wrap that 
looks like something people wear to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not there for vanity. It's a shock absorber worn to  
protect the Dallas wide receiver's midsection in case he's ever 
jolted the way he was by Seattle's Fred Thomas on Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	In what seemed like a routine tackle, Mills suffered a  
season-ending and career-threatening perforation of his small 
intestine after making a 3-yard catch. He underwent surgery the 
next day, then went nearly two weeks before eating solid foods. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't a big guy,'' Mills said. ``He just hit me right.''  
</P>
<P>
	The blow took out more than the 5-foot-11, 192-pound Mills. It  
also seemed to level the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas went on to beat the Seahawks to improve to 8-3. The  
Cowboys lost their next three, barely beat two bad teams, then 
ended the season in the first round of the playoffs against 
Arizona, a team they'd beaten twice with Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	In six games without Mills, Dallas averaged 16.5 points per  
game. They averaged 26.7 points in the 10 games he was healthy. 
And, he still wound up leading the team with four touchdown 
catches. 
</P>
<P>
	What made Mills so vital to an offense headed by Troy Aikman,  
Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin was his knowledge of the offense 
being installed by then-rookie coach Chan Gailey. Mills had played 
for Gailey in Pittsburgh from 1994-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills left the Steelers in 1997 for what turned out to be a  
disastrous season in Carolina. When he was looking for a job in 
1998, he reunited with his former coach on his new team in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills was like a coach on the field and in the locker room as he  
helped teammates grasp the new system. Then he made defenses pay 
for single covering him while double-teaming Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
	The results: 28 receptions, of which 21 went for first downs, 12  
came on third downs and nine covered at least 25 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a lot of confidence in what I was doing,'' Mills said.  
``The injury really, really hurt me because there were some things 
I really wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mills returns to even better circumstances this year. His  
teammates understand Gailey's system better and an improved 
offensive line should give Aikman more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to see him back out there,'' said Cowboys owner  
Jerry Jones. ``It was a close call for him last year, but he's got 
it behind him mentally and physically and we're all happy to have 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The soft-spoken Mills was respected by teammates before he was  
hurt, and there's no doubt their appreciation of him has grown. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a very smart player,'' Aikman said. ``He really  
understands how to set up routes and make them all look the same. 
Ernie is probably the slowest receiver we have on the field, yet he 
gets open as much as anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mills, a nine-year veteran, said he doesn't expect any problems  
related to the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fine,'' Mills said after a recent workout. ``I don't feel  
any pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He feels so good that he doesn't even think he needs the  
protection around his waist. He insists he's only wearing it to 
make others happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my doctors recommended it -- highly,'' Mills said. ``He  
said everything has healed completely inside, but he'll feel more 
comfortable if I have a pad on.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Roller Coaster Mishap Hurts 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENA PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A piece of wood came loose from the  
track of a Knotts Berry Farm roller coaster ride Monday, injuring 
five people. 
</P>
<P>
	The piece, which was several feet long, fell from the Ghostrider  
and hit passengers in one of the ride's cars, park spokesman Bob 
Ochsner said. The wood was decorative and not a structural piece of 
the roller coaster, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims suffered minor injuries, Ochsner said. He said a  
12-year-old boy and 58-year-old man suffered cuts, and the other 
passengers, ages 10 to 13, were treated for bumps. 
</P>
<P>
	The roller coaster was closed for inspection. It was the first  
accident on the ride since it opened in December.

<HEADLINE> Centura To Buy Triangle Bancorp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. (AP) -- Centura Banks will buy Triangle Bancorp  
in a $608 million merger of North Carolina-based banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock transaction announced Monday values Triangle at about  
$23, with Centura swapping 0.45 share of its stock for each share 
of Triangle. 
</P>
<P>
	Triangle, based in Raleigh, has assets of $2.3 billion and  
deposits of $1.8 billion at 71 locations in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Centura operates 227 branches throughout North Carolina,  
Virginia and South Carolina with total assets of $8.8 billion and 
deposits of $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Triangle is an exceptionally well-run organization that will  
allow us to greatly strengthen our North Carolina franchise and 
further leverage our business strategy to the benefit of the 
customers of the combined companies,'' said Cecil W. Sewell, 
Centura chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Triangle chairman Michael S. Patterson is to become chairman of  
the Centura board upon completion of the deal, expected late in the 
first quarter of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sewell will remain chief executive officer, and Centura's  
headquarters will stay in Rocky Mount. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction is subject to normal shareholder and regulatory  
approvals.

<HEADLINE> Europe Has Air Traffic Control Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- From sushi bars to sex shops,  
Frankfurt Airport offers travelers plenty of ways to occupy their 
time before flying. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there may be demand for even more: Nearly half of last  
month's flights to and from the airport were delayed at least 15 
minutes and some were hours late. 
</P>
<P>
	The tardiness is so severe that Lufthansa AG has begun keeping  
three jets with crews on standby here just to fill in for flights 
that are seriously delayed. All three replacement jets have been 
busy, the airline says. 
</P>
<P>
	In skies across Europe, unprecedented numbers of passenger  
flights are overloading the region's fragmented air traffic control 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	A surge in flights packed with vacationers heading for the  
Mediterranean has added to the strain. Holiday travel increased 
just as the skies were clearing of disruptions caused by NATO's 
spring offensive in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have once again reached a crisis situation,'' said Emanuela  
Petracchi, a Geneva-based spokeswoman for the International Air 
Transport Association, an airline trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar problems in the United States have contributed to a  
doubling of delays and cancellations by U.S. airlines over the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	At airports in 32 European countries, airline deregulation and  
cheaper fares helped boost the number of passenger flights to more 
than 734,000 in July, a 17.6 percent increase from three years ago. 
Delays due to air traffic problems have risen even faster, 33.5 
percent in the same period, IATA says. 
</P>
<P>
	In Spain, a shortage of air traffic controllers caused delays  
earlier this year, and a strike by baggage handlers affected 
flights to the Canary Islands, a popular tourist destination. 
</P>
<P>
	Flights to Switzerland and southern France suffered delays after  
the French, fearing potential job losses, halted efforts to 
reorganize control of the airspace along the Franco-Swiss border, 
Petracchi said. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of July, delays topped the list of complaints by  
passengers in Europe, said Hans Krakauer of the International 
Airline Passengers Association, a consumer group based in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Other passenger gripes? Poor service on the ground and in the  
air, including cramped seating and dirty rest rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a very filthy toilet ... and if you point that out  
to a cabin attendant, the usual reply is, 'What do you want us to 
do about it?''' Krakauer said. ``The passenger is getting a lousier 
deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delays have been most severe at Milan's Malpensa Airport, where  
75 percent of all departures and arrivals were late in the 
April-June quarter. Barcelona and Madrid fared almost as badly, 
while Scandinavian airports had the most-punctual flights, 
according to the Brussels, Belgium-based Association of European 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	For Frankfurt to suffer widespread delays shows just how bad the  
situation has become. 
</P>
<P>
	Flughafen Frankfurt/Main AG, the busiest airport in continental  
Europe, long prided itself on its efficiency. Yet delays here grew 
from 30 percent of all departures in the first quarter of the year 
to 36 percent in the second quarter. In July, 48 percent of all 
departures were delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviation officials blame most of the problem on air-traffic  
bottlenecks elsewhere in Europe -- something over which Frankfurt 
has little, if any, control. 
</P>
<P>
	A charter flight from Frankfurt to Adana, Turkey, was one of  
several to suffer delays on a recent afternoon. The reason: last 
week's earthquake in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Feryat Nural, 27, tried to amuse his two bored children while  
waiting for the flight to be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here, it's like I'm in prison,'' the Turkish metalworker said,  
pointing out that the airport's 180 shops and restaurants were too 
pricey for his pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
	The main obstacle to timely fights in Europe is the region's  
poorly organized airspace -- a patchwork of zones managed by 65 
different air traffic control centers using 35 different monitoring 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Aircraft often must adjust their speed, course or altitude each  
time they enter a new air traffic control zone. Many countries also 
make passenger planes fly around airspace reserved for their 
military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Lufthansa, which is headquartered in Frankfurt, says its jets  
have used up $16 million worth of fuel this year just to make such 
adjustments. The airline also must absorb the cost of operating its 
three reserve jets and crews. 
</P>
<P>
	Air France has put the cost of delays this summer at around  
$350,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines and airports blame Europe's disjointed flight control  
network on politicians intent on jealously guarding sovereignty 
over national airspace at the expense of Eurocontrol, an agency in 
Brussels that supervises regional air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurocontrol can propose ways of integrating the various air  
traffic control systems, but European governments have denied it 
enforcement power. 
</P>
<P>
	``They created an artificial currency called the euro,'' said  
Frankfurt airport spokesman Klaus Busch. ``So why can't they do 
something in the air traffic business?''

<HEADLINE> Philippine, Lufthansa in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine Airlines said Monday it is  
in talks with German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG to form a joint 
cargo venture that will give PAL a presence in the European cargo 
market for the first time in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed ``block space'' agreement, PAL will buy space  
on Lufthansa's cargo flights between Manila and Frankfurt. The 
service is expected to start Nov. 1, with three flights a week 
using Lufthansa's MD-11 jets. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL said the deal would give it a ``toehold in the rapidly  
growing cargo market of Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PAL last carried cargo to Europe in June 1998, when it was  
forced to suspend flights to Frankfurt, Paris and London because of 
the Asian financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned joint cargo service is a result of a new bilateral  
air agreement signed recently by Germany and the Philippines, PAL 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives German carriers expanded rights to operate  
passenger and cargo flights to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lufthansa unit, Lufthansa Consulting, is scheduled in  
September to begin a two-year contract to help turn debt-laden PAL 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been unable to service its $2.2  
billion debt, owed largely to U.S. and European creditors, because 
of Asia's financial crisis and labor problems.

<HEADLINE> Navigation Glitch Hits Calif. Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- A glitch in a satellite-based  
navigation system caused many users to lose contact with the 
system, U.S. Coast Guard and Japanese officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots, boaters, motorists and even hikers with hand-held  
devices use the Global Positioning System to pinpoint their 
locations with the help of satellite signals. To account for 
variations in the Earth's orbit and rotation, the system requires 
an exact measure of time. 
</P>
<P>
	Many older units were only designed to count a fixed number of  
weeks -- a maximum that lapsed Saturday. Their time clocks had to be 
reset, making some users vulnerable to a break in service. 
</P>
<P>
	GPS, originally designed for the military, is booming in the  
commercial market, often offered in luxury cars. Aviators and 
boaters have been using the system for at least a decade and in 
recent years hikers have begun to use hand-held units. 
</P>
<P>
	A nationwide, private tow boat agency, Vessel Assist Association  
of America, based in Newport Beach, reported scattered GPS outages 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem is that it takes us a long time to find  
the mariner in distress if we don't have an accurate position. We 
had some delay in serving boats today,'' said Bob Cunningham, an 
agency dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
	No boaters were in any serious danger, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard in California received at least two calls: one  
boater hadn't yet left the harbor when his GPS failed, and another 
was lost and had to fire a flare to summon help, said Petty Officer 
Dawn Butler. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration had no reports of problems,  
said agency spokesman Les Dorr, adding that private plane pilots 
had been warned to check their systems. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, where as many as 5 million drivers rely on the system  
to navigate the country's maze of roads, a top Tokyo manufacturer 
of auto devices, Pioneer Corp., was flooded with thousands of 
complaints about its machines going haywire. But there were no 
reports of traffic accidents.

<HEADLINE> Norris Emerges as Tyson Opponent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Orlin Norris has emerged as the likely comeback  
opponent for Mike Tyson, whose first fight since getting out of a 
Maryland prison will now take place in late October. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to Tyson's camp said Monday Norris is expected to  
sign this week for a fight that will take place either Oct. 22 or 
Oct. 23 at the MGM Grand hotel-casino in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight was originally set for Oct. 2, but was postponed  
because of troubles finding an opponent for Tyson. Tyson's manager, 
Shelly Finkel, originally wanted Buster Douglas, but he was not in 
shape to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris and Zeljko Mavrovic were the two possible opponents for  
Tyson, and Norris emerged in the last week as the favored pick of 
both Finkel and Showtime, which will televise the fight on its 
cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Norris, the older brother of former junior  
middleweight champion Terry Norris, is a former cruiserweight 
champion. Despite 26 knockouts on his 49-5 record, Norris is 
defense-oriented and his fights are often devoid of action. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 220 pounds, Norris would be closer to Tyson's weight  
and have less of a height advantage than the 6-foot-4 Mavrovic, a 
former European champion from Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming Tyson beats Norris, he is expected to fight on a  
pay-per-view in December, possibly against Shannon Briggs.

<HEADLINE> 'Summer '69' Play Honors Woodstock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                     *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even the most peripheral rock fan can come out  
humming the tunes in ``Summer '69,'' the new off-Broadway musical 
celebrating Woodstock, the granddaddy of all rock festivals, and 
the times that helped create it. 
</P>
<P>
	In this engaging show at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater, the  
seven actors effectively use quick costume changes to jump from one 
generation to another. One example: When a girl lies to her father 
that she'll be going to church camp for the weekend, the father is 
played by Ron McClary; later, he will don a headband and portray a 
teen musician. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes the adult characters are more entertaining than the  
kids, as they blame Dr. Spock for youthful rebellion, ruminate on 
the Depression and World War II, become Max Yasgur welcoming 
everybody to his farm or become a cheery lady organizing 
sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
	En route to Woodstock in Act 1 and at the concert in Act 2,  
everyone is smoking, sniffing or swallowing dope. ``I didn't know 
where I was but I knew where I was headed,'' one woozy fellow 
proclaims. None of the deaths or injuries that occurred at the 
real-life Woodstock are portrayed in this upbeat show, though one 
scene includes a twitching ``weird trip'' and another has a person 
complaining he received a tattoo while high. 
</P>
<P>
	The vignettes which make up the storyline exist mainly to  
support the songs. The numbers start with ``Woodstock,'' which Joni 
Mitchell wrote after the August festival of peace, love and music. 
There's John Sebastian's ``Summer in the City,'' Janis Joplin's 
wonderful ``Mercedes Benz'' and Santana's strong ``Black Magic 
Woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights leaders' pictures are projected while the actors  
sing Bob Dylan's ``The Times They Are A'Changing,'' with the import 
of a Woody Guthrie proclamation. Vietnam protest gets its due with 
Country Joe and the Fish's ``I Feel Like I'm Fixin' To Die Rag.'' 
Stephen Stills' thoughtful ``Find the Cost of Freedom'' ends the 
first act. 
</P>
<P>
	Act 2's 1969 musical hits include Grace Slick's dope song,  
``White Rabbit,'' her husband Darby Slick's ``Somebody To Love,'' 
with psychedelic colors moving on a screen, and Joplin's ``Piece of 
My Heart'' all sung by E. Alyssa Claar. The entire ensemble sings 
the Beatles' ``With a Little Help from My Friends,'' the Band's 
``The Weight,'' Pete Seeger's ``Turn, Turn, Turn'' and the finale, 
Sly and the Family Stone's ``Dance to the Music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides McClary, the ebullient cast is made up of Jamie Hurley,  
Brian Maillard, Kirk McGee, Anne Moore, Rik Sansone and Christine 
M. Williamson. A five-piece band backs them and singers Claar and 
Rachel Stern. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Van Horn, Ellen Michelmore and Leer Paul Leary, none of  
whom went to Woodstock, wrote the book. Bruce Lumpkin directed.

	Dow Soars 199.15 to Record Close  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average soared to a  
record today as investors banished fears that the Federal Reserve 
will raise interest rates repeatedly in its bid to quell inflation. 
At the close of trading, the Dow was up 199.15 at 11,299.76, 
surpassing its July 16 record close of 11,209.84. With today's 
gains, the Dow is up 23 percent for the year. Broader stock 
indicators also rose sharply, although they remain below their 
record highs of mid-July. A wide range of stocks rose today, from 
fledgling Internet companies to multinational consumer companies.

	Analysts Expect Interest Rate Hike  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve will make good on Alan  
Greenspan's pledge to ``promptly and forcefully'' deal with 
inflationary threats by boosting interest rates tomorrow for a 
second time in eight weeks, analysts are predicting. But the real 
question may be what happens after that. Will Fed policy-makers see 
enough signs of a slowdown in economic growth that they won't feel 
the need to boost rates even higher in the fall? Wall Street today 
was clearly taking the view that tomorrow's rate hike will be all 
the Fed needs to contain the inflation threat. The Dow Jones 
industrial average shot up 199.15 points, closing at a record 
11,299.76.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court ordered  
reconsideration today of a judge's restrictions against shipments 
by Microsoft Corp. of software containing Java programming 
language. A judge ruled last November that Sun Microsystems was 
likely to show that Microsoft had violated a licensing agreement 
allowing it to use Sun's version of Java in its products. The 
injunction prohibited Microsoft from distributing products that 
used Sun's Java copyrights, unless Microsoft conformed to Sun's 
standards for Java. The court said the judge failed to explain why 
the alleged violation was a copyright infringement. Microsoft stock 
closed up 3 1/16 at 86 7/16, as did Sun Microsystems, up 9/16 at 74

Corp. warned in a report issued today. The head of the FDIC said 
the agency is monitoring the situation. Prices for corn, soybeans, 
wheat and other crops have been depressed for the second year in a 
row because of huge harvests worldwide and the recent economic 
crises in Asia and Russia.

	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A private investment group has joined the  
bidding for Eskimo Pie, offering $10.125 a share for the company. 
The bid, valued at $35 million, comes as Eskimo Pie's largest 
shareholder is attempting to replace the company's board of 
directors with one willing to sell the company off in pieces. 
Yogun-Fruz, which owns a 17 percent stake in Eskimo Pie and has 
made several previous attempts to acquire the company, initiated a

<HEADLINE> Arnett Working on CNN History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Peter Arnett, who left CNN in the wake of a  
retracted story about nerve gas, is collaborating with a former 
colleague on a history of the network -- with the cooperation of 
their ex-bosses. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, which doesn't have a publisher yet, will be about how  
CNN has changed television news since the cable network began 
operations in 1980, said Ed Turner, co-author with Arnett. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner, CNN's former executive vice president, is now president  
of the Forum Network, a fledgling public affairs cable network that 
is due to debut in November. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN founder Ted Turner, who is not related to Ed Turner, and CNN  
Chairman Tom Johnson have agreed to talk to their former colleagues 
for the book, network spokesman Earl Casey said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett's reporting during the Persian Gulf War was a key element  
in establishing the network with viewers. He left CNN in the 
aftermath of the 1998 report on alleged nerve gas use by U.S. 
forces during the Vietnam War, which was later retracted by the 
network. Arnett now works for ForeignTV.com, a Web site devoted to 
international news. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett and Ed Turner's own stories will be included, but the  
book isn't about them, Turner said. It will examine, among other 
things, the rise of talk television and the news presence on the 
Internet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to set out to write a book that helps to tear  
down something I helped build,'' Turner said.

<HEADLINE> PCP, Cocaine Vaccination Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Designer antibodies may someday be used to  
immunize people against cocaine and other drugs to block the rush 
that users crave. 
</P>
<P>
	If these vaccines fulfill their promise, they could  
revolutionize emergency treatment for PCP and amphetamines. And 
though they won't cure addiction, they could also help people who 
want to kick the habit, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal would be to protect against the sudden unexpected  
urge to use, so that if the patient used it, he wouldn't get the 
effects,'' said Dr. Michael Owen, a pharmacologist at the 
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences who hopes to begin 
tests this year on a PCP overdose treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The illegal drugs all have molecules so tiny they sneak  
unnoticed through the body's immune system. To create antibodies, 
researchers must hook the molecule to a protein big enough to set 
off the immune system's alarms. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug-plus-protein can be injected directly, to prompt the  
body to make its own antibodies. Or scientists can create the 
antibodies by working with laboratory animals and inject them into 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, the antibody grabs the drug in the bloodstream,  
before it gets to the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	At least, that's how it works in animals so far.  
</P>
<P>
	Antibodies could be used to treat an overdose or block a drug's  
effects for a longer period, perhaps a month or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Both PCP and methamphetamine last for days in the body, unlike  
cocaine, which is metabolized in 20 minutes or so. 
</P>
<P>
	PCP intoxication can be fatal, and both it and amphetamine  
psychosis can leave permanent mental scars, said Frank Vocci, head 
of medications development for the National Institute on Drug Abuse 
and Alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
	The ability to bind the drugs to antibodies could be a major  
leap forward in treating them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocaine addiction is a much bigger and trickier problem. More  
than 2 million people need treatment. About 900,000 a year start 
treatment, but at least three-quarters go back to the drug, Vocci 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe if we had something to help them out for the initial  
period, it might boost the efficacy keep them in longer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists involved in the research discussed their work Monday  
at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, one cocaine vaccine, developed by a biomedical company  
in Massachusetts, is being tried on people at a Connecticut clinic. 
So far, only the safety has been tested, and it had virtually no 
side effects, said Dr. Thomas Kosten, a psychiatry professor at 
Yale University and chief of psychiatry for the Veterans 
Administration in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was not designed to look at the effectiveness of the  
vaccine, but a few of the participants reported that cocaine 
``doesn't seem to have the bang that it used to have,'' Kosten 
said.

<HEADLINE> A Calculated Risk To Bypass Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain's likely  
strategy of skipping the Iowa caucuses is risky but may offer the 
best out of a bunch of long odds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bypassing Iowa would rob him of the heavy media attention given  
to candidates running in the state and deny him the ``bump'' that 
benefits strong performers there. But analysts says McCain is 
simply a better fit in other early states, New Hampshire and South 
Carolina among them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not new and it's a difficult strategy,'' said Norm  
Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	But given the dynamics of this election cycle, it may be the  
best alternative open to McCain, Ornstein and others argued. 
</P>
<P>
	While most of the Republican presidential contenders are  
battling for the caucuses, McCain has chosen to ignore that opening 
test -- just as he sat out the Iowa straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	He says nothing is settled and a final decision on his strategy  
won't come until the fall. There's little doubt, however, that 
he'll skip Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may want to be part of the genuine balloting process which  
takes place in New Hampshire and South Carolina,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain hasn't campaigned in Iowa and party leaders say there's  
been no informal contact from his campaign. ``I haven't seen hide 
nor hair of any McCain supporters,'' said GOP state executive 
director Dee Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	While the calendar is still in some flux, it's likely Iowa's  
caucuses will be in late January and New Hampshire's primary in 
early February. 
</P>
<P>
	``There (are) still only eight days between Iowa and New  
Hampshire and the winners out of Iowa will get the usual media 
tidal wave,'' said University of Virginia political scientist Larry 
Sabato. ``John McCain on his own is going to have to splash in the 
water to try to create a tidal wave and that's tough to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others have skipped Iowa when the state didn't fit their plans.  
Vice President Al Gore sought the Democratic presidential 
nomination in 1988 running as a centrist, but got no traction in 
Iowa and dropped out of the caucus campaign to focus on other 
states, where he ultimately came up short. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is busily campaigning in Iowa this time.  
</P>
<P>
	Analysts see some sound reasons for McCain's strategy.  
</P>
<P>
	He faced a tough sell in Iowa to begin with, in part because he  
has fought against federal subsidies for ethanol. Ethanol, 
distilled from corn, is popular in Iowa -- in both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, he has managed to improve his poll standings in New  
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the tradition that one of the top three candidates coming  
out of Iowa has the legs to get the nomination,'' said Greg 
Mueller, a strategist for Steve Forbes. ``We're all going to hit 
the ground in New Hampshire sprinting and he'll be in a fast 
walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sabato noted that New Hampshire voters have a tradition of  
being contrary, and breathed new life into Pat Buchanan's campaign 
last time by giving him a surprising win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they do like to reshuffle the deck and make their  
influence felt,'' Sabato said. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina presents an even better opportunity for McCain in  
its Feb. 19 primary. McCain has worked the state hard, calling it 
``the gateway to the Republican nomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a strong military presence in the state with more than  
400,000 veterans, a solid audience for McCain's story of spending 
five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	That message will be reinforced in coming weeks with the release  
of McCain's new book on his family's strong military traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	As chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, McCain has shown  
an ability to raise money from sources not drained by Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner, and he can likely assemble 
the resources to last through the first few tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The key, analysts say, is to stick around long enough to take  
advantage of any opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing the other candidates can do is to keep enough  
money and have enough strategic sense to stay alive past those 
early tests,'' said Ornstein, speaking of candidates other than 
Bush. ``It's at least theoretically doable to make this happen.''

<HEADLINE> Owner Would Sell Grizzlies, Canucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- After a weekend of mixed  
messages, Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment officials said Monday 
that owner John McCaw is seeking a partner to help offset the 
losses he has suffered with the NHL's Vancouver Canucks, NBA's 
Grizzlies and GM Place, the teams' home. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCaw ``would certainly entertain'' any offers to purchase  
all three enterprises, said Orca Bay president Steve Bellringer. 
</P>
<P>
	``His first thought pattern is he'd like to stay in ... be a  
minority partner,'' Bellringer said. ``If somebody came along and 
had a strong interest in buying the entire thing, John would 
certainly entertain that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bellringer wouldn't rule out the possibility of McCaw selling  
one of the teams while keeping the other and the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``People may have different comfort levels with different  
teams,'' he said. ``There may or may not be different ownership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bellringer's comments seemed to backtrack on statements made  
over the weekend by another Orca Bay official who said McCaw, the 
Seattle businessman who made millions in the cellular telephone 
business, was definitely interested in selling his three Vancouver 
sports properties. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's now reached the point where a minority partner is not  
necessary and he's prepared to sell both teams and the arena,'' 
Kevin Gass, Orca Bay's vice-president of communications said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so said Stan McCammon, the company's deputy chairman.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is not accurate to characterize this as placing a `For  
Sale' sign on the company's assets,'' McCammon said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But, should someone want to buy the entire organization, ``we  
have a responsibility to review any offer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCammon said McCaw wants to keep the teams in Vancouver.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is a priority for him and the issue will be raised with any  
potential investor,'' the release said. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing that is clear is the Grizzlies and Canucks continue to  
lose a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
	Canucks management said the team has lost close to $100 million  
over the last four years. The small profit GM Place turns is eaten 
up by the Grizzlies losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes Magazine's last estimates pegs the Canucks value at $100  
million and the Grizzlies at $133 million. GM Place cost $168 
million when it opened in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellringer noted the Canucks have cut their losses from over $36  
million in 1998 to over $20 million last year. The new NBA 
collective agreement also gives owners more leverage in controlling 
salaries and re-signing young stars.

<HEADLINE> Dumas Avoids Prison Term for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Former NBA player Richard Dumas vowed Monday  
to stay drug-free after avoiding a possible prison term on drug 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa County District Judge Thomas Gillert gave the 30-year-old  
Dumas a two-year deferred sentence for his guilty pleas to a felony 
charge of cocaine possession and a misdemeanor of possessing drug 
paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge warned Dumas that he could face prison time if he  
resumes using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillert ordered him to meet requirements that include submitting  
the results of routine urine analysis, continued treatment and 
counseling. If he meets the conditions of the deferred sentence, 
Dumas' record could be expunged, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flip side is if you fall off the wagon you could be  
sentenced to the maximum this charge carries,'' Gillert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumas, who played at Oklahoma State before playing in the NBA  
with the Phoenix Suns and Philadelphia 76ers, completed two months 
of substance abuse treatment prior to sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Bryce Kennedy, said Dumas could have faced as many  
as 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumas said a major difference in current treatment compared with  
past rehabilitation attempts has been the use of medication to 
treat a chemical imbalance. He said he was diagnosed with bipolar 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm staying on my medication,'' he said. ``I haven't felt this  
way in a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tulsa native said he plans to stay in Enid, where he has  
been undergoing treatment, to be near a support group. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he has signed a contract to play with a professional  
basketball team in England. He said he is awaiting a work permit 
that could mean leaving for workouts later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumas, whose basketball career has long been overshadowed by  
drug and alcohol abuse, left the courtroom saying he needed no more 
incentive than the judge's orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to take care of myself which is what I'm choosing,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Residents To Vote on Wal-Mart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUREKA, Calif. (AP) -- The landscape doesn't look like a  
bellwether for a town's future -- 32 scruffy, polluted acres 
surrounded by industrial buildings, abandoned warehouses and some 
old, rusty railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Wal-Mart officials seeking to build a mega-store on the  
site, residents of this seaside timber town have been asked to 
decide the issue with the future in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	While company officials say they're merely hoping for a chance  
to do business with Eureka's 28,000 residents, critics contend the 
store has bullied its way onto the ballot. If it prevails, they 
say, it will steal the town's best hope for the future: a new port. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote scheduled Tuesday on whether to rezone the 32-acre lot  
comes only after the California Coastal Commission last fall 
refused to allow it, and after the City Council passed a measure 
opposing the change. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company was able to bypass local government after a  
local resident sponsored a ballot drive. Since then, the company 
has spent $235,000 wooing Eureka's 13,000 voters, according to 
financial records cited by project opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart spokeswoman Daphne Davis has said the $235,000 figure  
``sounds about right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The battle over the tract also has been marked by a Wal-Mart  
telephone marketing campaign in which residents were called as many 
as seven times a day and asked about their vote. After receiving 
complaints, Wal-Mart fired the marketing company, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The land in question has sat idle since Union Pacific Railroad  
shut down its engine turnaround area two decades ago. Residents 
rarely visit the area, which serves as a camping spot for the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the spot remains the last undeveloped waterfront area  
that would let the city build a viable, deep-water, commercial 
port, some say. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our future. Our future is in the bay,'' said Patty  
Berg, chairwoman of the anti-Wal-Mart committee. ``We were founded 
as a seaport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local business owner John Bradley, who chairs the city's Harbor  
Committee, agreed. ``If you take this land and turn it into a big 
box store you will never get it back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart supporters question why the land hasn't already been  
developed if it's so valuable. City Manager Harvey Rose said that 
when Union Pacific decided to sell, it solicited bids and received 
11 inquiries, but only from retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirty acres does not make an impact on harbor development,''  
Rose said. ``These are the first people who've come along with the 
wherewithal to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Wal-Mart's Davis, ``If there's going to be port development  
that will happen with or without Wal-Mart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, the fight has sparked debate in a city whose  
economy -- built on the timber and fishing industries -- has 
stagnated in recent years. Nearly two dozen stores are vacant at 
the city's Bayshore Mall and boarded up storefronts take up several 
blocks downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been able to sit back and let the timber companies  
support us with little effort from the community,'' said Dale 
Warmuth, general manager of Leon's Mufflers. ``If (Wal-Mart) really 
came in and did some honest-to-God redevelopment here, I think 
they'd be applauded.''

<HEADLINE> Vitamin C Increase in Humans Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Megadoses of vitamin C reduced the effects of  
stress in rats and apparently can help boost the production of an 
illness-fighting antibody, a researcher says. 
</P>
<P>
	In light of the findings, health agencies should consider  
increasing the recommended dose of the vitamin in humans, now based 
on the amount needed to prevent scurvy and anemia, said P. Samuel 
Campbell, chairman of the biological sciences department at the 
University of Alabama at Huntsville. 
</P>
<P>
	His speech Sunday to the American Chemical Society came almost  
five years after the death of Linus Pauling, the Nobel-winning 
chemist who suggested in the 1970s that large doses of vitamin C 
might prevent colds and other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell and his colleagues immobilized a group of rats for an  
hour a day to stress them. A control group was not immobilized. 
</P>
<P>
	In both animals and people, the adrenal glands react to stress  
by releasing hormones that trigger the ``fight or flight'' 
reaction. The researchers found that 200 milligrams of vitamin C a 
day reduced the levels of stress hormones in the rats' blood. 
</P>
<P>
	The dose is the equivalent of several thousand milligrams a day  
in people -- far beyond the current recommended level of 60 
milligrams. More than a thousand milligrams (one gram) a day can 
cause nausea, stomach cramps, diarrhea and, occasionally, kidney 
stones, according to The American Medical Association Encyclopedia 
of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Stress also suppresses the immune system, and Campbell found  
that megadoses of vitamin C increased the levels of an antibody -- 
which fights against germs and viruses -- in both stressed and 
unstressed rats. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the increase in antibody level was greater in the  
unstressed rats, suggesting that stressed animals may need larger 
vitamin doses to keep the immune system going, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitamin C also reduced other indicators of stress, such as loss  
in body weight, enlargement of the adrenal glands and reduction in 
the size of the spleen and thymus gland, he said.

<HEADLINE> Texas Remembers Last Year's Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEL RIO, Texas (AP) -- Screams of horror echoed from flooded San  
Felipe Creek a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The usually calm brook that has meant life and livelihood for  
generations of people in this Texas-Mexico border city, raged so 
violently that residents still haven't fully recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, on the anniversary of that storm, they are watching a new  
natural disaster in South Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Bret made landfall Sunday about 70 miles south of  
Corpus Christi. However, it was moving toward the west-northwest 
today, and was expected to turn more westerly. That track would 
take Bret south of Del Rio and into northern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 12 months ago, Del Rio's residents watched another stormy  
intruder arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gone through about five floods,'' said 90-year-old Manuel  
Blanco, explaining that none had ever been as terrible as when 
remnants of Tropical Storm Charley dumped more than a foot of rain 
in a 24-hour period on previously parched Del Rio. 
</P>
<P>
	The monster storm pelted the area beginning Aug. 23 and reached  
a crescendo early the next day when a wall of water roared through 
San Felipe Creek before dawn, sweeping away homes, cars and people. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine people were killed in flooding that weekend in Del Rio and  
the neighboring Hill Country. Hundreds of homes were damaged or 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Death and destruction visited other parts of Del Rio, a city of  
about 33,000 people. But the San Felipe neighborhood and its mostly 
poor, Hispanic residents near the center of town were hardest hit. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the city's oldest sections, the San Felipe area was  
settled in the late 1800s when the San Felipe Agricultural, 
Manufacturing and Irrigation Co. paid its employees with land 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Historic buildings surrounding Brown Plaza -- a scenic square at  
the heart of the neighborhood -- were scarred or destroyed in last 
year's deluge. 
</P>
<P>
	On nearby streets, some houses remain in ruins. Others are  
livable, but many are not the homes they once were. 
</P>
<P>
	Piles of debris dot the landscape. Fences are mangled. Vehicles  
are crunched. Crosses adorned with flowers and American flags mark 
the spots where loved ones disappeared or perished. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blanco family remembers hearing the shrieks of neighbors who  
were trapped in their homes or sucked into the streets by the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a girl drowning. She passed by and she was trying to  
grab wherever,'' said Virginia Blanco, 47, Manuel Blanco's 
daughter. Fortunately, the young woman was rescued after getting 
stuck beneath a truck, Ms. Blanco said. 
</P>
<P>
	The house Manuel, Virginia and her 16-year-old son, Angel  
Blanco, shared was damaged, as were an adjacent closed-down grocery 
store and storage building the family owns. 
</P>
<P>
	Like scores of other families, the Blancos are living  
temporarily on the edge of town in a mobile home provided by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 126 families were placed in FEMA manufactured housing  
after the flood, and 122 families still live in the mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some may opt to buy the homes if they can't return to their  
original houses by the 18-month cutoff date when they must leave 
the temporary housing. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Enriqueta Sanchez, 65, wants to move a mobile home onto  
the property where she once had a house. Her home was so damaged by 
the flood it was torn down. 
</P>
<P>
	She still visits her empty lot with her grown daughter, sitting  
quietly beneath large trees and reflecting on her loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big, old house,'' Ms. Sanchez said proudly, speaking  
in Spanish. ``I had a big fence all around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Blanco, a night-shift counselor at a rape crisis center, has  
received some government money for repairs to her family's house 
and furniture. But she's found the $6,000 stipend hasn't gone as 
far as she'd hoped and that some contractors haven't been 
trustworthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there were the looters. They stole a television set,  
bicycles, a new $800 air conditioning unit and porcelain dolls she 
was awarded for selling Avon cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials have identified 197 severely damaged or destroyed  
homes in the flood zone targeted for a buyout. The program is 
funded by $4.6 million in federal money to combined with a smaller 
chunk of local and state money. 
</P>
<P>
	Assisting Del Rio's flood victims has been difficult because of  
the poverty in the town and a lack of available rental housing, 
said Terry Newman, an individual assistance officer with Texas' 
Division of Emergency Management. 
</P>
<P>
	At the moment, Ms. Blanco simply wants to get the home's  
plumbing and utilities working so her family can live there again, 
even if they have to sleep on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	As she looks at her elderly father watering plants and feeding  
cats during a visit to the tattered home, Ms. Blanco breaks down in 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing my best to try and get him back here,'' she said.  
``But with my income it's hard to pick up the pieces. That's what 
hurts me the most. He wants to come back.''

<HEADLINE> Courier Loses at Pro Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Seventh-seeded Jim Courier lost to  
60th-ranked Sargis Sargsian 6-4, 6-4, in the first round of the 
U.S. Pro-Tennis Championships on Monday at Longwood Cricket Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier was hoping to make amends after losing last month in the  
Davis Cup quarterfinals on these same courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier and Sargsian, who both live in Orlando, Fla., have been  
frequent practice partners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I practice with him so much, I feel more confident playing him  
in a match,'' Sargsian said. ``And I'm a more mature player right 
now. I'm hitting solid from the baseline. My biggest weapon tonight 
was my backhand down the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Sargsian's serve had a lot to do with his success  
against the 36th-ranked Courier. He lost only 14 points on serve in 
the match and served the last three games at love. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first set, after squandering six set points, Sargsian  
finally ended the set with a service ace. 
</P>
<P>
	Sargsian broke at love for a 4-3 lead in the second set.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was not what I was looking for tonight,'' Courier said.  
``I just wasn't sharp and I was pressing because he wasn't missing. 
I'll just have to regroup and get ready for New York and the U.S. 
Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, fourth-seeded Cedric Pioline and eighth-seeded Jonas  
Bjorkman were easy afternoon winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Pioline, No. 1 in France and a two-time Grand Slam finalist,  
used a strong service and steady ground strokes to put away 
Argentine Gaston Gaudio, 6-4, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Bjorkman beat Slovakia's Jan Kroslak 6-2, 7-6 (7-4).  
</P>
<P>
	``I moved him around a little better on the second set and he  
made a lot of unforced errors,'' said Pioline, a one-time runnerup 
at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to keep playing some matches here to get ready for  
next week's Open. If I play three or four matches, I'll be a 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also advancing to the second round was sixth-seeded Marat Safin  
of Russia, a 7-5, 7-5 winner over Italy's Gianluca Pozzi. 
</P>
<P>
	Other first-round winners were France's Arnaud Clement, who  
outlasted Slava Dosedel of the Czech Republic 3-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2; 
Australia's Andrew Elie, who was leading Romanian Andrei Pavel, 
6-3, 1-0, when Pavel retired with an elbow injury; and Cecil Mamiit 
edged Costa Rican Juan Antonio Marin, 7-6 (7-1), 6-4.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PERTH, Australia (AP) -- Searchers in a helicopter found an  
American tourist alive early today after he traveled 250 miles, 
sometimes barefoot, and survived 40 days in the desert by eating 
plants and drinking muddy water. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Bogucki, 33, a volunteer fireman from Fairbanks, Alaska,  
was spotted in a dry creek bed in the Great Sandy Desert and was 
transferred to a hospital in Broome, 1,000 miles north of Perth, 
Western Australia's state capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian authorities launched a search after Bogucki's bike  
and camping equipment were found at the edge of the Great Sandy 
Desert on July 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters in Broome, Bogucki said he ran out of food  
a few days into his trek and kept himself alive by eating plants 
and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to spend a while on my own, just nobody else  
around, just make peace with God I guess,'' Bogucki said. ``I can't 
really say specifically what it was, but I do feel satisfied that 
I've scratched that itch -- whatever that was -- that sent me out 
there in the first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bogucki reportedly told his American girlfriend, Janet North,  
that he intended to find ``spiritual enlightenment'' in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Waller, a television reporter aboard the helicopter, said  
Bogucki lost 44 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been drinking very muddy water and just staying alive  
really by the skin of his teeth,'' Waller told Perth radio station 
6PR. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Eddie Clouter of the Broome police said Bogucki was in good  
physical and mental condition but would remain at Broome District 
Hospital overnight for observation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's fine, a bit dehydrated, but that's about all,'' Clouter  
said. ``He's got a few scratches on him, as you would expect, and 
obviously he's tired. 
</P>
<P>
	``But for someone who's been wandering around the desert for  
that long, he's doing pretty well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bogucki was spotted in the Edgar Ranges, 110 miles southeast of  
Broome. Local volunteers and Aboriginal trackers helped in the 
hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Broome police Sergeant Wally Wolfe said Bogucki was unaware a  
search had been mounted for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd seen the odd aircraft fly over, but he didn't know they  
were looking for him,'' Wolfe said. ``We knew from his girlfriend 
that he was a bit of a loner, and it turns out he had no idea 
you're supposed to tell someone before you go off into the 
desert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Describing the moment of his rescue, Bogucki said: ``I was  
walking through the river bed and all of a sudden there was a 
helicopter overhead, and I said 'Oh a helicopter. I wonder if he's 
here for me?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfe said police would not bring charges against Bogucki, but  
he described him as irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
	And would Bogucki repeat his ordeal?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh no. This is a once in a lifetime thing for me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bogucki's family and friends were elated at the news of his  
survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't do justice to it ... we were just very, very happy,''  
his father, Ray Bogucki, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. from 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Local police abandoned their search earlier this month, but it  
was revived last week with the arrival of an American search team. 
The eight-member 1st Special Response Group based in Miami set out 
Thursday with three dogs to look for Bogucki.

	``But for someone who's been wandering around the desert for  
that long, he's doing pretty well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bogucki was spotted in the Edgar Ranges, 110 miles southeast of  
Broome. Local volunteers and Aboriginal trackers helped in the 
hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Broome police Sergeant Wally Wolfe said Bogucki was unaware a  
search had been mounted for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd seen the odd aircraft fly over, but he didn't know they  
were looking for him,'' Wolfe said. ``We knew from his girlfriend 
that he was a bit of a loner, and it turns out he had no idea 
you're supposed to tell someone before you go off into the 
desert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Describing the moment of his rescue, Bogucki said: ``I was  
walking through the river bed and all of a sudden there was a 
helicopter overhead, and I said 'Oh a helicopter. I wonder if he's 
here for me?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfe said police would not bring charges against Bogucki, but  
he described him as irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
	And would Bogucki repeat his ordeal?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh no. This is a once in a lifetime thing for me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bogucki's family and friends were elated at the news of his  
survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't do justice to it ... we were just very, very happy,''  
his father, Ray Bogucki, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. from 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Local police abandoned their search earlier this month, but it  
was revived last week with the arrival of an American search team. 
The eight-member 1st Special Response Group based in Miami set out 
Thursday with three dogs to look for Bogucki.

<HEADLINE> AMA Endorses Managed Care Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American Medical Association announced its  
endorsement Monday of a Democrat-led House plan to protect the 
rights of patients better in managed care plans and said it is 
joining other medical groups in a national ad campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the AMA, made by its board at a meeting this  
weekend in Chicago, was praised by President Clinton for sending 
``a strong message to Congress'' that it is time to pass meaningful 
patient rights legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, sponsored by Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., and  
Charles Norwood, R-Ga., would ensure that people in HMO plans have 
access to emergency room care, guarantee access to specialists, let 
patients get doctor referrals outside their networks and allow 
lawsuits against HMOs that deny care. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 House Republicans led by Norwood, dissatisfied with GOP  
leaders' plans for more modest legislation, joined Democrats in 
sponsoring the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill delivers the essential protections patients and  
voters are demanding,'' the AMA president, Dr. Thomas Reardon, said 
in a statement. ``Doctors will be allowed to make medical 
decisions. Health plans will be held accountable for their 
actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA said it was joining other groups, including the American  
Dental Association and the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists, in running newspaper ads in the districts of 28 
House members in support of the Dingell-Norwood bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance and HMO industries are lobbying hard against the  
legislation, contending it would drive up the costs of medical care 
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwood said the AMA endorsement ``is a big step forward in  
passing a bill into law.'' He said it confirmed that ``the 
consensus bill is the one bill that can unite both sides of the 
aisle and restore patient rights in the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed a more restrictive GOP-written patients rights  
bill in July after rejecting several Democratic provisions, 
including one that would have allowed patients harmed by medical 
decisions to sue their health plans for damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Senate-passed bill was unacceptable, and aides  
said he would veto it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and other GOP  
leaders tried unsuccessfully to unite their slim majority behind a 
Republican bill. Several health care professionals, including 
Norwood, a dentist, and Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a physician, 
demanded stronger legislation similar to that pushed by the 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, shortly after Norwood and Dingell introduced  
their plan, Hastert promised a vote on health care reform when 
Congress returns next month from its August recess. 
</P>
<P>
	In a concession to supporters of expanded rights to sue, Hastert  
said the main vehicle for that vote would be legislation being 
written by Coburn and Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., that is close to 
Dingell-Norwood on the lawsuit question. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coburn-Shadegg bill, which has yet to be introduced, also  
would contain provisions to help those currently uninsured get 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA commended Coburn and Shadegg for their efforts and said  
it would work with them and GOP leaders as legislation moves toward 
a vote. Dingell-Norwood supporters said they will offer their bill 
as an alternative to the GOP plan.

<HEADLINE> Old Ammo Scares Boaters in Ohio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT CLINTON, Ohio (AP) -- With the sky darkening over Lake Erie,  
the Toussaint River should be crowded with boaters and fishing 
vessels heading in to avoid the approaching storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Not this summer.  
</P>
<P>
	Few boaters have the guts to navigate the Toussaint, fearful of  
artillery shells and other ammunition that were fired decades ago 
from a testing range and are now resting at the shallow mouth of 
the river. 
</P>
<P>
	While the river is technically still open for boaters, the  
hazard has been deadly to businesses dependent on summer tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're killing us,'' said Kent Floro, owner of Floro's  
Marina, which closed for the first time in 46 years after the Coast 
Guard advised boaters not to use the river. ``We can't get 
liability insurance. The insurers say we're knowingly letting 
boaters go into a hazardous area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The military fired howitzers and machine guns from an Army site  
toward Lake Erie from 1918 until 1966. During war years, there was 
shelling nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
	It's impossible to say how much ammunition is resting at the  
river's mouth. But the military estimates that as many as one in 
five of the old shells is still live. 
</P>
<P>
	Storms and strong winds have washed some of the ammunition  
ashore. Those that remain underwater are not really a danger unless 
there's a chance that a boat strikes bottom. And that's the problem 
at the mouth of the river, where the silt constantly builds up and 
needs to be dredged out. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been injured -- not yet, at least.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's something in the back of my mind all the time,'' said Joe  
Tate, a Delaware fisherman who has been on the river a few times 
this summer. ``I'm constantly watching when I'm on the river.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hazard is likely to fixed by a two-month government dredging  
project that began Monday. But the river's mouth isn't likely to 
stay safe for long before the sand and silt raise the level of the 
river bottom again. 
</P>
<P>
	Boaters aren't the only ones in danger. Once in awhile, swimmers  
and hunters have come across a shell in the shallow water or 
marshes along the shoreline about 30 miles of Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherry Finken knew right away that's what got her 10-year-old  
son's attention when they were wading near shore last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was yelling, `Mom, Mom!' and I said, `Whatever it is, move  
away!''' she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	What they saw were three 12-inch mortars just below the surface.  
She no longer allows Clay to go into the water by himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have warned that ammunition does not make for a good  
souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you find one, leave it alone,'' said Mike Slovak, a  
demolition safety specialist with the Army Corps of Engineers. 
``All it takes is something to hit it on the nose.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Thurmond To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Strom Thurmond, the oldest member of  
Congress at 96, is back in the hospital after collapsing late last 
week on a trip back home to South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond entered Walter Reed Army Medical Center Sunday night  
complaining of tiredness after a busy schedule in South Carolina, a 
statement from his office said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	While in the hospital, Thurmond also will undergo surgery for a  
chronically enlarged prostate, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican senator was released from a Columbia hospital  
Friday night after tests following his collapse earlier that day at 
a reception at the University of South Carolina. He appeared 
unsteady as he left the hospital, but he continued his weekend 
schedule, which included a wedding for a former aide in Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said Thurmond decided to go ahead with his  
prostate surgery because the gland had given him more trouble in 
recent months. The surgery had been scheduled for November but now 
will be done Wednesday, and he is expected to remain hospitalized 
through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond was first elected to the Senate in 1954 and became the  
oldest person to serve in Congress at age 93. At 94 he became the 
longest-serving senator ever. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been hospitalized briefly several times in recent years,  
including for a day in Washington after he became dizzy in October 
1997. He also spent several days in a military hospital for a 
respiratory infection that December and earlier that year was 
hospitalized in Washington recovering from the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond spokesman John DeCrosta said the senator received his  
annual physical at the Medical University of South Carolina in 
Charleston last week and was pronounced healthy.

<HEADLINE> $65M Doesn't Buy What It Once Did </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- Sure, $65 million doesn't buy what it once  
did. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chip Ganassi wasn't complaining. Not for the moment, anyway.  
</P>
<P>
	This was late Sunday afternoon and his planets were all in  
alignment. His rookie driver had just won a race named for his car 
team's sponsor in front of a near-sellout crowd, on a brand-new 
track that he helped build and pay for. He was surrounded by a tent 
full of well-wishers, many of them paying customers who'd made 
their way down from the grandstand to toast his victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Then someone had to go and spoil the mood by asking Ganassi how  
he was going to top it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried about next year,'' he said, tugging at the  
bill of his cap. ``I'm worried about next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are plenty of reasons why Ganassi, president of the new  
Chicago Motor Speedway, and some of the other bigshots in the 
Championship Auto Racing Teams circuit do not want to get ahead of 
themselves. Ever since the split with Indianapolis Motor Speedway 
boss Tony George in 1995, CART's future seems to be on the 
installment plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The heroes whose names people know -- A.J. Foyt, Mario Andretti,  
Al Unser, Rick Mears and Emerson Fittipaldi -- are retired. While 
attendance is steady at its road courses and street races, the 
crowds are dwindling at many of the oval tracks CART visits. 
Television ratings are slipping. CART is fighting the rival Indy 
Racing League circuit -- bankrolled by George -- for the open-wheel 
racing crowd and all the while, NASCAR is poaching fans from both. 
</P>
<P>
	The future is anything but assured. Though they've met several  
times about ending the split, so far the CART-IRL people have been 
much better at waging war than making peace. But for a little while 
at least, all those concerns got shoved into the background. 
</P>
<P>
	The circuit was bringing Indy-car racing back to one of the  
nation's biggest market for the first time in 80 years. And even 
better, CART was opening for business in the area some two years 
before a nearby IRL-backed racetrack would be able to stage its 
first race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Motor Speedway is what the drivers like to call ``a  
clean sheet of paper,'' meaning nobody knows exactly how to run on 
it. It's a 1-mile oval, 70 feet wide in the straightaways and 80 
feet in the turns, generous enough to let three cars battle for 
position on the turns. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it mattered most, Michael Andretti, Mario's son and  
arguably the best-known name on the CART circuit, and Paul Tracy 
crashed heading into the third turn on lap 99. 
</P>
<P>
	Both drivers escaped serious injury, but Tracy's nickname on the  
circuit, ``Captain Crunch,'' says everything you need to know about 
who was at fault. 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti has tangled with him before, which explained why he  
began an interview with ABC this way: ``Normal Paul Tracy driving. 
He's going to kill someone out there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a shame. We both had a good race going and he puts  
me down. I had nowhere to go. I can't believe what he did. Why? 
What is he thinking? I don't understand? Does he have a death wish? 
Is he trying to kill us both? I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, the only thing Tracy endangered was the fans'  
interest. Since CART no longer offers the star-studded fields of 
just a few years ago, taking out one of its few recognizable names 
was not a good thing. Especially since Al Unser Jr. -- who still has 
the name, if not the driving skills -- ended his day 35 laps earlier 
by pulling into the infield grass with an engine belching like a 
small smokestack. 
</P>
<P>
	Then an interesting thing happened. The race only improved.  
Ganassi's rookie driver, Juan Montoya of Columbia, grabbed the lead 
on lap 127 and played a very entertaining game of cat-and-mouse the 
rest of the way with Dario Franchitti and Jimmy Vasser, who 
finished second and third. It would have been more entertaining, 
except that a few cars not on the lead lap inserted themselves 
between the contenders at various junctures and made for some 
maddening missed chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, everything about the show -- the drivers, the product,  
the backdrop -- was big league. That was not lost of Indy boss 
George, who showed up Friday and got a tour of the new facility 
from Ganassi himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what was discussed, Ganassi replied, ``Nothing -- and  
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been friends for 20 years,'' he went on. ``The sad thing  
about feuds are that they make people choose sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is rumored to be another high-level meeting between CART  
and the IRL at midweek. That makes the new, $65 million racetrack 
either a bargaining chip in peace talks or a very reckless gamble. 
And Ganassi removes any doubt about which he thinks it is in a 
heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows this sport needs to be put back together,'' he  
said, tugging at the bill of his cap again. ``Everybody.''

<HEADLINE> Bucs' Sapp Has MRI on Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay's Warren Sapp, sidelined the past  
week by a sore back, had a MRI examination Monday to determine the 
extent of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buccaneers said the result would not be known until Tuesday  
after the test is read by the team's orthopedic specialist, Dr. 
John Zvijac, in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``My anticipation is everything will check out fine, and he'll  
be OK,'' coach Tony Dungy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle last practiced on Aug.  
17. The Bucs also held him out of last Saturday night's exhibition 
against the Kansas City Chiefs as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Sapp, who has only missed two games in four pro seasons, said he  
didn't think the injury was serious. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still able to get up in the morning and walk without too  
much pain. But it's just sitting down and certain things that hurt 
me more than others. I'll be all right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating because it's something I can't treat. Like an  
ankle, I can go in there and ice and (electrically stimulate) it 
all day long and do whatever I need to do. Backs are kind of funny. 
It's my first one, so we'll see how it goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sapp said he wanted Monday's test ``for my peace of mind more  
than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the MRI says nothing, I've got to go. My rule goes, `if it  
ain't broke, let's go.'''

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Moves Into Berlin Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Returning Germany's center of power to Berlin,  
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder inaugurated his new office today and 
began governing from the historic capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving into temporary quarters in the heart of the bustling  
city, Schroeder virtually completed the government's $10.8 billion 
eastward return after 50 years in the sleepy city of Bonn, the 
former West German capital. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall signaled the end of  
Europe's Cold War division, the 55-year-old chancellor marked the 
start of the ``Berlin Republic'' -- the label for a new Germany less 
burdened by the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``A dozen years ago, anyone who would have predicted this would  
have been dismissed as crazy,'' Schroeder said at a small ceremony 
where Berlin mayor Eberhard Diepgen welcomed the chancellor to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder is the first leader since World War II to rule all of  
Germany from the one-time Nazi and imperial Prussian capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy to be able to be in Berlin,'' Schroeder said,  
adding that he was certain it would become ``one of the great 
metropolises of the world, if it isn't already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament has already made the 375-mile trek from Bonn -- files,  
desks and all -- and will start sessions in the refurbished 
19th-century Reichstag building next month. 
</P>
<P>
	For a historic occasion, today's event will be low-key in  
keeping with postwar Germany's aversion to pomp: only a welcome by 
Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen is planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the government can hardly avoid history's shadows as it  
settles in. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder will govern from an office once used by East Germany's  
communist rulers because the new chancellery won't be finished 
until next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer moves into a  
building that housed the Nazi central bank and, later, the East 
German communist party. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder has called the government's return to Berlin a ``new  
beginning'' that will also put politicians in closer touch with 
Germany's lingering east-west divide. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he has little time to ponder the occasion's significance.  
Fresh from summer vacation in sunny Italy, he faces tough decisions 
on the economy, a slump in popularity and a revolt over domestic 
policy among his governing Social Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	A monthly opinion poll by ZDF public television last week said  
the government's approval rating was at its lowest since Schroeder 
took office in October at the head of a center-left coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for the slump are planned cuts in Germany's generous  
welfare state that Schroeder says are necessary to spur investment 
and lower stubborn double-digit unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a newspaper interview Sunday, Schroeder rejected complaints  
by unions and his party's left wing that the austerity plans are 
unfairly harsh. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be no wavering,'' he told Bild am Sonntag. ``We have  
to stay on course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to show he's in charge, Schroeder has a packed calendar  
in his first week in Berlin. He meets other coalition leaders to 
talk strategy late today and discuss controversial plans to trim 
pension increases with unions on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, he chairs a Cabinet session that is expected to  
approve the first part of the austerity package.

the country's national soccer team might play in the United States 
this year, while U.S. soccer and government officials said there 
are no plans for any matches between the countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contacts have recently been made between the Iraqi Soccer  
Federation and the American soccer federation to hold a number of 
soccer matches,'' the committee said Monday in a statement carried 
by the official Iraqi News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jim Moorhouse, a U.S. Soccer Federation spokesman, said  
from Los Angeles on Monday that, ``We have not had any contact with 
them. We have no plans to put them on our schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. state department also said it unaware of possible games  
between the countries. 
</P>
<P>
	An Iraqi team has not played in the United States since Iraq's  
invasion of Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the Iraqi committee, Alaa Maki, was interviewed by  
the Al-Jazeera satellite television of Qatar on Monday. Asked 
whether such games were suitable when U.S. warplanes were 
conducting almost daily airstrikes on Iraqi targets, Maki said: 
``The Iraqi Olympic committee is a member of the international 
Olympic family and we try hard to separate sports from politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee -- which is headed by Odai Saddam Hussein, the  
eldest son of President Saddam Hussein -- says it has received a 
written invitation from the U.S. Soccer Federation.

<HEADLINE> Probation, Parole Numbers Top 4 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans on parole or probation at the end of  
1998 numbered more than 4 million for the first time ever last 
year, but differences in policies made for wide variations among 
the states, the Justice Department reports. 
</P>
<P>
	There were large declines in the number of adults on parole in  
several states, including Virginia, down 37 percent, and North 
Carolina, down 30 percent, the department's Bureau of Justice 
Statistics said Sunday. In contrast, Ohio had a 66 percent increase 
in parolees and Idaho reported a 55 percent jump. 
</P>
<P>
	A change in Ohio law contributed to its increase, said Thomas P.  
Bonczar, a bureau statistician. ``A lot of states are passing 
mandatory parole,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the increase in the number of parolees was  
balanced by states that have toughened their laws to keep offenders 
in prison longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The national release rate declined from 37 per 100 prisoners in  
1990 to 31 in 1997, while average time served increased from 22 
months in 1990 to 27 months in 1997, Bonczar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 3,417,613 people were on probation and 704,964 were on  
parole at the end of 1998, up from 3,296,768 and 694,787, 
respectively, a year earlier. Adding those in prisons or jails, the 
U.S. correctional population totaled 5,890,300 last Dec. 31, up 
from 5,726,500 when 1997 ended. 
</P>
<P>
	A probationer is a person convicted of a crime and sentenced to  
supervision outside jail; a parolee is an offender under 
conditional supervision after serving a prison term. 
</P>
<P>
	Idaho and Vermont each reported a 21 percent increase in their  
probation populations, the largest among the states, while 11 
states reported declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonczar noted that while violent crime has declined in recent  
years, there have been increases in drug abuse violations and 
convictions for fraud and forgery, which tend to be the types of 
crimes for which people are sentenced to probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 96 percent of parolees had been convicted of a felony.  
Fifty-seven percent of those on probation had committed a felony, 
40 percent were convicted of misdemeanors and the rest were found 
guilty of other infractions. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 parolee population was 55 percent white, 44 percent  
black, 21 percent Hispanic -- who can be of any race -- and 88 
percent male. In 1990, 52 percent of parolees were white, 47 
percent black, 18 percent Hispanic and 92 percent male. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those on probation, 79 percent were male, down from 82  
percent in 1990. Whites made up 64 percent of probationers, down 
from 68 percent, while the share of blacks grew from 31 percent to 
35 percent. Hispanics made up 15 percent of probationers, down from 
18 percent in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Analysts Expect Interest Rate Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve will make good on Alan  
Greenspan's pledge to ``promptly and forcefully'' deal with 
inflationary threats by boosting interest rates Tuesday for a 
second time in eight weeks, analysts are predicting. 
</P>
<P>
	But the real question may be what happens after that. Will Fed  
policy-makers see enough signs of a slowdown in economic growth 
that they won't feel the need to boost rates even higher in the 
fall? 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street on Monday was clearly taking the view that Tuesday's  
rate hike will be all the Fed needs to contain the inflation 
threat. The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 199.15 points, 
closing at a record 11,299.76. 
</P>
<P>
	But private analysts cautioned that this market euphoria may be  
overdone. They noted that while the economy has slowed in recent 
months, it is still expected to grow almost 4 percent this year, a 
robust rate that has pushed unemployment down to its lowest level 
in three decades and left the Fed worrying about rising wage 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed is fearful that the economy is expanding too strongly,  
that labor markets are too tight and that inflationary pressures 
will develop if things don't slow down,'' said economist Mark Zandi 
at Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Zandi said he believed the Fed would raise rates not only this  
week, but again at its next meeting Oct. 5. And he predicted the 
central bank would likely hint at future moves in its Tuesday rate 
announcement in part to toss cold water on an overly optimistic 
stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think these stock market highs are of concern to the Fed,''  
Zandi said. Much of the strong consumer spending driving the 
economy, he said, is coming because consumers feel wealthy thanks 
to their investment gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the market's confusion over Fed intentions may stem from  
botched signals by the central bank, some analysts believe. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 30, the Fed boosted its target for the federal funds  
rate, the interest banks charge on overnight loans, by a 
quarter-point to 5 percent, the first increase in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	While the markets had widely expected that rate hike, the Fed  
announced at the same time that it was moving its policy directive, 
which foreshadows future moves, back to neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets, which had feared the June 30 rate hike would be just  
the first in a series, rallied on the Fed's announcement of the 
neutral policy directive. That boosted stock prices back up and 
pushed down long-term interest rates, which are set by the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Fed completely misread the potential market  
response to a shift back to a neutral bias,'' said David Jones, 
economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York. ``Greenspan tried 
to correct the situation by sounding more hawkish in his July 
testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delivering his midyear report on the economy to Congress on July  
22, Greenspan said the Fed was still prepared to move ``promptly 
and forcefully'' to counter inflation, remarks taken as strongly 
signaling a rate hike at their August meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In all of this maneuvering, the Fed is walking a delicate line.  
Greenspan has been worrying since December 1996 about ``irrational 
exuberance'' pushing stock prices too high. At that time, the Dow 
was hovering around 6,500, and it's gone up by 70 percent since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Greenspan and other Fed policy-makers are clearly  
nervous that stock prices are inflated and could suddenly come 
crashing to earth, they don't want to be blamed for causing that by 
pushing interest rates higher than necessary to deal with the 
problem the Fed is supposed to worry about -- inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed doesn't want to cause a recession, they just want to  
make sure that inflation doesn't get out of hand,'' said David 
Wyss, economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. 
</P>
<P>
	Many see the Fed's goal this year as taking away the stimulus it  
provided last fall when it cut interest rates three times to 
counter a growing threat that the Asian crisis could topple the 
United States into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed critics contend the world is still in too fragile a state to  
embark on a series of rate hikes, especially with American 
manufacturers and farmers struggling to cope with lost export 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deflation is far more of a danger today than inflation as  
farmers across the country can tell you,'' Republican presidential 
candidate Steve Forbes said Monday in urging the central bank not 
to raise rates Tuesday. ``Jacking up interest rates now would be a 
pre-emptive strike against American prosperity, not against 
inflation.''

<HEADLINE> Indian Gambling Initiative Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Proposition 5, the big-money ballot  
initiative to expand legalized gambling at Indian casinos in 
California, was struck down today by the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-1 ruling said the proposition, which had been put on hold  
while the court reviewed the case, violated a state constitutional 
ban on Nevada-style casino gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court appears impossible, because  
the ruling is based on California law, on which the state court is 
the highest authority. Sponsors of Proposition 5 have already 
started circulating petitions for a March 2000 initiative that 
would amend the state Constitution to authorize increased 
reservation gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision also limits California tribes' ability to negotiate  
an expansion of reservation gambling with Gov. Gray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 5 was approved by 63 percent of the voters last  
November after a campaign that cost nearly $100 million, a national 
record for a ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of the money came from tribes who sponsored the  
initiative. The opposition campaign was largely bankrolled by 
Nevada casinos, whose owners feared competition from the Indians' 
casinos. The Nevada casinos also funded one of the two lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure legalized a wide range of lucrative, previously  
banned video gambling terminals and card games on California Indian 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribes turned to the ballot after then-Gov. Pete Wilson refused  
to allow the expansion they sought. Federal prosecutors say tribal 
casinos are operating thousands of illegal slot machines, but 
they've held off on enforcement during the court case. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who took no position on last year's ballot measure, had  
been negotiating with tribes on possible casino expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The suits before the court were filed by a Nevada-backed group  
of homeowners and businesses, who objected to expansion of nearby 
tribal casinos, and by the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees 
International Union, which considered the measure's protections for 
unions inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Gribbon, the union's California political director, praised  
today's decision, saying Indian gambling agreements ``should be 
negotiated with the full participation of the California state 
government'' and protect casino workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The critics had argued that Proposition 5 violated a provision  
of a 1984 initiative, now part of the state Constitution, that 
established the California lottery. It prohibits the Legislature 
from allowing ``casinos of the type currently operating in Nevada 
and New Jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state constitution bans ``banked table (card) games and slot  
machines.'' The majority opinion by Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar 
said that Proposition 5 authoritzed video gambling terminals that 
were in effect slot machines, and card games such as blackjack that 
have essentially the same payoff system as Las Vegas casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	The lone dissenter, Justice Joyce Kennard, disagreed with  
Werdegar's analysis of Proposition 5 gambling, saying the ruling 
``rejects the will of the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suits also contended that the initiative violated federal  
law, which authorizes each state's governor to negotiate with 
tribes on the scope of reservation gambling. Another claim was that 
the measure violated the governor's constitutional authority and 
was a special-interest contract, not a law.

<HEADLINE> Greene Wants To Be Complete Sprinter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- He's enjoying the best season of any male  
100-meter sprinter in history -- breaking the world record, running 
under 10 seconds nine times and winning his second world title. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Maurice Greene still has something to prove.  
</P>
<P>
	A day after capturing the gold medal at the World Championships  
in 9.80 seconds, just short of his own world record, Greene said he 
won't be considered a truly great sprinter until he completes a 
100-200 double. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be the complete sprinter, that's practically every  
sprinter's goal,'' Greene said Monday. ``He wants to show the 
versatility, that he's not just a 100-meter sprinter, that he can 
also run the 200 meters. I believe that's what makes you great, 
when you can do both and not just stick to one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene will get his chance this week when he bids to become the  
first man to win both sprints at the World Championships, and the 
first at any major championship since Carl Lewis at the 1984 Los 
Angeles Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The 200 heats are scheduled for Tuesday, the semifinals  
Wednesday and the final Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene also is competing in the 400-meter relay in a bid for  
three gold medals. He said he would run in all the rounds, not just 
the final, and would probably run the anchor leg. The relay final 
in next Sunday on the final day of the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that (100) race last night, my mind has quickly switched  
to the 200 meters,'' said Greene, relaxing at a sponsor's lounge 
near the stadium. ``I have to start concentrating on that and do 
the things I have to do to win a double.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If not for his manager, Emanuel Hudson, Greene might not have  
been going for the double at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's open, if he tells you truthfully, he didn't want to  
run the 200 this year,'' Hudson said. ``I've been telling him that 
to be considered a real runner you've got to win both races. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way the public and media perceive an athlete, they don't  
put you in the great category until you cross categories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson pointed to the example of Michael Johnson, who  
accomplished a historic 200-400 double at the 1995 worlds and 1996 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael Johnson has run more sub 43s than anybody in the 400  
meters,'' he said. ``But he was everything when he won the 200 and 
the 400. So I said, `Maurice, you're the world champion in the 100, 
you should take this to the 200.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson said he also motivated Greene by citing all the attention  
being paid to Marion Jones' historic bid for four gold medals in 
Seville and five at next year's Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him, `You're the world champion and you're dominating  
in the 100, but everybody's still talking about Marion Jones. You 
know why? Because Marion is saying I'm going to win five gold 
medals, going to get this and that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene is still relatively unproved in the 200, where the  
technique of running the bend contrasts with the straight dash in 
the 100. Greene won the U.S. 200-meter title this year in his 
season's best time of 19.92. 
</P>
<P>
	His chances of victory in the 200 in Seville have been bolstered  
by the absence of his friend and training partner, Ato Boldon, the 
reigning 200 champ who is out with an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The big question is whether former world champion Frankie  
Fredericks of Namibia, who scratched from the 100-meter final with 
a thigh injury, will line up for the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll find out when it starts,'' Greene said. ``I don't worry  
about any other runner. If he's in, he's in. If he's out, he's out. 
I still have to run the same race whether he's in the race or 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that race is anything like Sunday night's 100 final, watch  
out. Despite a slight stumble out the blocks, Greene blazed to the 
second-fastest time ever, just .01 off the world mark of 9.79 he 
set in Athens, Greece, on June 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``That little problem I had at the beginning of the race -- that  
was the world record,'' said Greene, who had hoped to run 9.76. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene brought his career total of sub-10 second races to 25,  
just one short of the all-time record held by Fredericks. Greene 
has recorded those times over a period of just three years. By 
comparison, Carl Lewis ran only 15 sub-10s in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene has taken the 100 meters to a new level. Now it's a  
matter of seeing just how far he can lower the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say I can only run this time,'' he said. ``If  
I say that, I'll believe once I run that time, that's as fast as I 
can go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe as time progresses man will get faster. I'm not  
going to limit myself to only one time. I believe I'll always be 
able to run faster. I haven't run the perfect race yet. If one day 
I do, we'll see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> CP&AMP;L To Merge With Florida Utility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH (AP) -- Carolina Power &AMP; Light Co. is buying Florida  
Progress Corp. for cash and stock worth $5.3 billion in a deal that 
will create the ninth-largest electric utility in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced Monday was approved over the weekend by  
the boards of directors at both companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal must also be approved by state regulators in the  
Carolinas as well as several federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	CP&AMP;L is buying Florida Progress at a premium, paying  
shareholders of the St. Petersburg-based utility $54 for each share 
of common stock -- 21 percent above Florida Progress's closing price 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the biggest acquisition in CP&AMP;L history, making the  
Raleigh-based gas and electricity provider a key player in the 
booming Southeastern energy market. 
</P>
<P>
	The new holding company will have 2.5 million customers in three  
states and total revenue of about $6.7 billion, based on 1998 
figures. The two utilities expect the merger to translate into 
savings of more than $100 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives us the size and the scope we need to be successful  
in the future,'' said William Cavanaugh, CP&AMP;L's chairman, president 
and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will enable us to increase earnings at a rate of 7 to 8  
percent, and we will be operating in one of the best areas in the 
country the Carolinas and Florida,'' he said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,250 positions will be cut as a result of the merger,  
Cavanaugh said. The reductions will affect both companies, he said. 
Employees were to be told about the merger today. 
</P>
<P>
	CP&AMP;L employs 7,650 -- a number that includes positions at N.C.  
Natural Gas Corp., the company CP&AMP;L acquired last month. Florida 
Progress has 9,600 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The new corporation, a yet-to-be-named holding company under  
which CP&AMP;L and its other businesses will be organized as 
subsidiaries, will eventually have 16,000 employees, a total 
reduction of around 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	About 44 percent of the job cuts will come from overlapping  
functions, including support services, accounting, treasury and 
legal services, Cavanaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the company will try to scale back its employment numbers  
in coming months, there will be no layoffs until the merger has 
been completed next summer, CP&AMP;L said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will try to manage this downsizing through attrition,''  
Cavanaugh told the newspaper. ``It will be in the interest of both 
companies to manage the company such that we can minimize the 
amount of actual employees who lose their jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cavanaugh, 60, will lead the new company as chairman, president  
and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Korpan, the head of Florida Progress, will retire as  
that company ceases to exist. He will serve on the board of the new 
holding company, which will be controlled by CP&AMP;L. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Power Corp., the electric subsidiary of Florida  
Progress, will still be based in St. Petersburg. The license of its 
nuclear plant, Crystal River, will be transferred to CP&AMP;L pending 
approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``This impacts a wide range of people and interests, including  
North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida ratepayers, shareholders 
and employees,'' said Jo Anne Sanford, chairwoman of the North 
Carolina Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our review will focus on whether the action is justified by  
public convenience and necessity, and we look at these mergers to 
determine whether there's any adverse impact on ratepayers,'' 
Sanford said.

                            *Alfons Bach    	
</P>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Alfons Bach, an industrial designer,  
architect and artist who helped create one the nation's first 
shopping malls, died Thursday. He was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Magdeburg, Germany, Bach studied architecture in Berlin  
and opened a design firm in New York City in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
	During a career that spanned seven decades, he worked on the  
Ridgeway Center, a pioneering shopping mall in Stanford, Conn., and 
designed the interior of Trans World Airlines' Constellation 
airliner for billionaire Howard Hughes, who owned TWA at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Bach was a co-founder and national president of the American  
Designers Institute, which later merged with the Industrial Design 
Society of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Bach's design clients included furniture maker Heywood  
Wakefield, carpet manufacturer Bigelow-Sanford, General Electric, 
Keystone Silver and Pacific Mills, a linen maker. 
</P>
<P>
	His drawings and papers are stored at the Cooper-Hewitt and the  
National Design Institute of the Smithsonian Institution in New 
York. Some of his works have been exhibited at the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art in New York. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Robert Byck    	
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Dr. Robert Byck, a Yale Medical School brain  
researcher who in 1979 warned Congress about the danger of smokable 
cocaine, died Aug. 9 of complications from a stroke suffered three 
days earlier. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1970s, Byck and a Yale associate, Dr. J. Murdoch  
Ritchie, were the first to show that the major component of 
marijuana -- tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC -- had a direct effect on 
nerve cells and was more dangerous than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly afterward, Byck and colleagues began a study on the use  
of coca paste in Peru that led him to predict a coming crisis in 
the use of smoked cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, Byck told the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse  
and Control that smoking coca paste gives a very intense, and 
almost immediate, high. Byck said that the United States did not 
have an epidemic of freebase or coca-paste smoking but that the 
possibility of one strongly existed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on the brink of a dangerous drug-use phenomenon,'' he  
said. ``We should do something about it as rapidly as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byck joined the Yale faculty in 1969.  

</P>
<P>
                           *Leo Castelli    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leo Castelli, who became one of the world's most  
influential art dealers by fostering the careers of such painters 
as Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, died Sunday following a 
short illness. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Castelli's New York galleries were showcases for major talents  
in the schools and styles that arose in post-war America and made 
New York the center of contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in the forefront in promoting the successors to abstract  
expressionism -- pop artists, minimalists and conceptualists. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Rauschenberg and Johns, Castelli's stable  
included Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, James 
Rosenquist, Robert Morris, Ellsworth Kelly, Kenneth Noland, Cy 
Twombly, Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Bruce Nauman, Richard Serra and 
Andy Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
	Some would defect to other dealers during the churning 1980s.  
</P>
<P>
	Castelli was born in Trieste in 1907 of well-to-do, socially  
prominent parents. He was educated in Milan and dabbled in the 
insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
	His marriage in 1933 to Ileana Schapira, daughter of a wealthy  
Romanian industrialist, led to a job in Paris and indulgence in the 
couple's interest in modern art. 
</P>
<P>
	Castelli opened a gallery in Paris with Rene Drouin, an  
architect and designer. Their first and only show, a surrealist 
exhibit, in 1939, was a success. Then World War II erupted and 
Castelli, a Jew, made his way to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, at age 50, he and his wife opened a small gallery in  
their townhouse home on East 77th Street and began looking for 
artists headed in new directions. Johns, Rauschenberg and Stella 
were among his early stars. 

</P>
<P>
                       *Barbara White Fishman    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barbara White Fishman, an advertising agency art  
director who became a Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
benefactor after developing breast cancer, died Thursday of the 
disease, which she had battled since 1985. She was 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. White gave $5 million to Sloan-Kettering to renovate its  
42-bed Women's Inpatient Center for diagnosis and treatment of 
gynecological cancers. She helped design and decorate the center to 
create a soothing atmosphere and to provide library space. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. White also helped hundreds of students buy art supplies and  
obtain scholarships for summer courses at the Art Students League 
of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. White designed album covers and liner notes for CBS Records.

</P>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Nathan Howard Geddings, a news  
photographer who worked for WLTX in Columbia, was killed Saturday 
in a three-car crash. He was 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Geddings was driving early Saturday morning when he crossed the  
center line and hit a pickup, which was then struck by another 
pickup, said police spokeswoman Leshia Utsey. 
</P>
<P>
	Geddings was not on assignment when the crash occurred.  

</P>
<P>
                            *Gus Girves    	
</P>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Gus Girves, founder of the Brown Derby  
restaurant chain, died Thursday after a long illness. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, Girves opened his first Brown Derby. He installed a  
huge bar in his first restaurant and sold liquor at cut-rate 
prices. The restaurant was open around the clock, and catered to 
war industry workers at the nearby Goodyear plant. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to open Brown Derby restaurants in Pennsylvania,  
Michigan, Florida and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Girves, son of a Greek immigrant, was also known for his support  
of the Greek community in the Akron area.

                         *Jim Hitchcock Sr.    	
</P>
<P>
	POMPTON PLAINS, N.J. (AP) -- Jim Hitchcock Sr., who spent 34  
years as a sportswriter, columnist and editor at The Star-Ledger of 
Newark, died Saturday after suffering from congestive heart 
failure. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock began his career at The Star-Ledger in 1957 as a copy  
boy. He retired from the newspaper in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to working on the sports desk, Hitchcock wrote a  
college football column and did Combo Special selections weekly on 
three or four pro football games. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, a son and three daughters.

<P>
                           *Rosie Jacuzzi    	
</P>
<P>
	WALNUT CREEK, Calif. (AP) -- Rosie Jacuzzi, the oldest member of  
the family that invented their namesake whirlpool, died Aug. 4. She 
was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jacuzzi family owned a machine shop where they built  
airplane propellers for the Army Air Corps during World War I. They 
expanded into airplane manufacturing after the war but quit in 1921 
after a fiery airplane crash killed several people, including Mrs. 
Jacuzzi's brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jacuzzi and her husband moved to a ranch near Brentwood  
where the brothers invented the Jacuzzi pump, first used to pull 
water from wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, when a nephew contracted rheumatoid arthritis and  
required water therapy, the Jacuzzi brothers modified their pump to 
create the whirlpool bath that bears their name.

<P>
                         *Vera Krasovskaya    	
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Vera Krasovskaya, a Russian dancer who later  
became a renowned ballet historian, died Aug. 15 after a serious 
illness. She was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Krasovskaya began her career in the 1930s as a dancer at the  
Kirov Ballet, based at the Mariinsky Theater in what was then 
Leningrad. She later studied at the city's Theater Institute and 
earned a doctorate in art criticism there in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	She wrote extensively on ballet issues for Soviet and foreign  
publications and published a number of books, including the 
multi-volume ``Ballet Theater in Russia'' and ``Western European 
Ballet Theater.'' 

</P>
<P>
                         *Donald Louis Mason    	
</P>
<P>
	HAWORTH, N.J. (AP) -- Donald Louis Mason, an FBI agent whose  
interest in art led to the creation of a loosely organized unit 
within the bureau's major theft squad in New York that targeted art 
thieves, died Aug. 10 of cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason's investigations included a widely publicized case in  
1976, when film director Otto Preminger reported the theft of a 
Kandinsky painting ``Leise Deutung'' (``Soft Interpretations''), 
from his New York office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason traced the painting from New York to Philadelphia, back to  
New York, and then to Basel, Switzerland, where it was seized and 
returned to Preminger. An advertising salesman was charged in 
connection with the theft. 
</P>
<P>
	After solving the case, Mason retired from the FBI and became a  
private consultant on art security. His clients included the 
Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Newberry Library in Chicago and the 
Art Institute of Chicago.

<P>
                        *Stanley J. Winkelman    	
</P>
<P>
	BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Stanley J. Winkelman, the former  
head of Winkelman's department stores who also was known for his 
community involvement, died Thursday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving as a naval officer in World War II, Winkelman  
joined the family-owned business in 1946. His father and uncle 
formed Winkelman Brothers Apparel Inc. in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1966, when the company became publicly held, Winkelman's had  
62 stores. Ten years later, Winkelman became chairman and chief 
executive officer. He retired in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie Retail Inc. purchased the chain in 1983 and last year, in  
the midst of bankruptcy reorganization, said it would close all 
remaining Winkelman's stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Winkelman's community involvement started in the 1960s, when he  
called upon the Detroit Board of Education to hire more black 
teachers. In 1967, following the Detroit riots, he called for an 
investigation of the city's police department.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Rises Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Natural gas futures rose sharply Monday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange despite reports that Hurricane Bret caused 
little damage over the weekend to offshore production rigs. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, pork futures rose sharply, while gold futures  
fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas continued its strong gains from last week, rising to  
its highest since November 1997, even as Bret was downgraded off 
the coast of Texas and oil companies began returning workers to 
offshore production platforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants noted two other storms are brewing in the  
Atlantic, a sign that this year's hurricane season could be a bad 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	That could come at a time when supplies in storage are nearly 6  
percent below year-ago levels, according to the American Gas 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers now are rushing to rebuild inventories after a hot  
summer across the eastern half of the country forced them to dip 
into stored supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Utilities use natural gas for electrical plants that power air  
conditioners and fans, while others use the commodity in the winter 
to heat homes, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas for September delivery rose 12.6 cents to $3.064 per  
each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and its products finished mixed during a generally  
listless trading session. October crude fell 4 cents to $21.84 a 
barrel; September heating oil rose .31 cent to 57.73 cents a 
gallon; September unleaded gasoline fell .02 cent to 65.95 cents a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as  
inventories became more bare just as meatpackers went on a buying 
spree. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department reported late Friday that frozen  
pork supplies were smaller than market participants had expected, 
while slaughter-ready supplies also have been smaller than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts noted, however, that the supply crunch isn't  
likely to last for more than a couple of months, as large breeders 
continue to churn out more product than the market needs. 
</P>
<P>
	October lean hogs rose 1.77 cents to 46.42 cents a pound;  
February pork bellies rose the limit 3 cents to 58.32 cents a 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures tumbled on the New York Mercantile Exchange,  
leading silver lower, as market participants rushed to lock in 
prices ahead of Britain's next planned gold sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were taking no chances for a repeat of sharp declines  
that came after the British Treasury last sold a portion of its 
holdings. With the next sale coming on Sept. 21, there was concern 
that prices again could dip to their lowest in more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold prices have been depressed amid fears that major central  
banks and the International Monetary Fund will dump their holdings 
as the metal loses its traditional role as an investment hedge. 
Many countries now are seeking better-returning investments such as 
Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	December gold fell $3.40 to $256.20 an ounce; September silver  
fell 11 cents to $5.145 an ounce.

<HEADLINE> Rio Grande Valley Spared by Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAYMONDVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Lupe Fuentes leaned against a police  
car outside the city's police station, waiting to board a school 
bus that would take him to higher ground to avoid Hurricane Bret's 
125-mph winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuentes, who says he has ``kinfolk on every street'' of  
Raymondville, was reluctant to leave on Sunday, and hoped he 
wouldn't have to spend more than a night in a shelter. All he 
brought was his cane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without my walker, I can't walk,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fuentes can likely go home soon. Since Hurricane Bret made  
landfall Sunday night in a sparsely populated area between Corpus 
Christi and Brownsville, evacuees from the coastal areas of the Rio 
Grande Valley have been able to breathe sighs of relief. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Bret has caused little damage to the Valley, though  
tornado and flash flood watches remain in effect there early today. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic along U.S. Highway 77 was a gauge for residents'  
lessening anxieties. On Saturday, with flooding highly feared, most 
of Brownsville used the road to evacuate. But by Sunday evening, 
residents were heading back, their city one of the Valley's drier 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not discouraging people who want to return to their  
homes,'' said Cameron County Judge Gilberto Hinojosa. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Raymondville and nearby Port Mansfield, on the  
northern end of the Valley, received strong winds and heavy rain. 
Downed trees and power lines were reported, and some damage to 
roofs occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Police recalled how 1988's Hurricane Gilbert dumped so much rain  
on Raymondville that water was chest deep and police evacuated 
people on boats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were catching trout over here,'' joked investigator Uvaldo  
Zamora. 
</P>
<P>
	For Fuentes, leaving his trailer home was difficult. Though he  
had it boarded up, he worried about what he would find when he 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he'd lost an air conditioning unit to thieves once before,  
he feared burglars along with the elements. 
</P>
<P>
	``When something like this goes around, everybody wants to break  
in,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Files Suit Vs. Muslim in LA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Muslim aerospace engineer is suing her  
former supervisor at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, claiming he 
stifled her career because of his own Islamic beliefs about the 
role of women. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lawsuit, which gets its first hearing Tuesday, Iranian  
immigrant Shahzad Khaligh claims that Fred Hadaegh repeatedly 
expressed his belief that Muslim women ``should not become 
independent human beings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hadaegh also tried to thwart Mrs. Khaligh's efforts to present  
technical papers at conferences and refused to sign her tuition 
reimbursement forms for a NASA program that helps employees advance 
their education, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was all the time telling me go home, get married, have  
babies,'' said Mrs. Khaligh, who left her 11-year career at JPL in 
September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, also claims that  
managers at the Pasadena-based facility, operated for the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration by the California Institute of 
Technology, knew of Hadaegh's alleged discrimination but did 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hadaegh, a senior research scientist, did not return a phone  
message left with his secretary. Gordon Krischer, an attorney for 
Hadaegh and the laboratory, said only that ``our clients believe 
there's no substance in the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits claiming discrimination against Muslims are common but  
most involve non-Muslims, according to leaders of the more than 5 
million Muslims in the United States. Several activists said Mrs. 
Khaligh's case was the first such lawsuit they had heard of. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear about this in conversations all the time, but it's  
usually in situations where the wife wants to work and the man has 
more traditional attitudes toward women,'' said Laila Al-Marayati, 
former president of the Muslim Women's League. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Al-Marayati said the claims don't surprise her because  
sometimes Muslim men ``are not able to shift when they come to this 
country. But I also know men who work alongside women, or have 
women as bosses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Women's status varies widely in the conservative Muslim world,  
from the strict interpretation of the Taliban in Afghanistan that 
bars women from work and school to their legal equality in secular 
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> `Millionaire' Gets Ratings for ABC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It takes place in what looks like a disco, with  
throbbing music to heighten the suspense. ``The music is driving me 
crazy!'' rants host Regis Philbin. He isn't alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' has hit the halfway mark in  
its two-week maiden run. Slotted by ABC every night through Aug. 29 
(except tonight, in deference to ``Monday Night Football''), this 
quiz show has won good ratings and kept viewers' adrenaline 
surging. 
</P>
<P>
	Philbin's, too. ``It's so nerve-wracking,'' he erupts, ``even I  
have trouble watching!'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the first serious reprise of those big-money quizzes of the  
1950s, ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' seems a pretty good answer 
to the million-dollar question plaguing networks today: How do you 
rally a sizable, enthusiastic audience without busting the 
programming budget? 
</P>
<P>
	So don't be surprised to see the relatively inexpensive  
``Millionaire'' return -- whether as a weekly series, as ``event'' 
fare during a ratings-sweeps month, or as a fill-in when another 
series flops. For network and audience alike, ``Millionaire'' hits 
the jackpot as a cheap thrill. 
</P>
<P>
	Just like a half-century ago, we love rooting for ordinary folks  
to make a score. 
</P>
<P>
	And we especially love it when the show, not the contestant,  
makes a mistake. On Thursday's installment, David Honea from 
Raleigh, N.C., answered that Lake Huron is the second-largest Great 
Lake in area. Wrong! Hours later, the producers realized he was 
right. Absolved, he'll resume his quest for $1 million on the 
series' final broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	But much has changed since June 7, 1956, when the pioneering  
``$64,000 Question'' premiered. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, it's tempting to say that the very nature of knowing  
has changed. On a '50s show like ``Question'' or ``Twenty-One,'' 
each contestant was left alone with his thoughts, sealed in a 
so-called isolation booth. Then he would summon each response from 
his private store of knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	But on ``Millionaire,'' the contestant is wired. Networked.  
Logged on to the accumulated wisdom of the ages. He can solicit 
advice from the studio audience, or phone a friend with the 
question. The individuality of yesterday has given way to 
interconnection. Clearly, it's no longer what you know that counts, 
but where you point-and-click to find out. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's the $32,000 question facing contestant Norman Payne, who  
creates crossword puzzles for a living: Unabomber Ted Kaczynski was 
a former math professor at what college? a) University of 
Washington. b) Berkeley. c) Columbia. d) Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne isn't sure. So he places a call to his friend Doug. He  
takes Doug's suggestion: b). Right! 
</P>
<P>
	With ``Millionaire,'' the idea is to finesse, endure and cash  
in, not flaunt your erudition. These days, in an odd turnabout, 
it's appliances that are ``smart,'' while people are ``plugged 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was quite a different ball game on ``Twenty-One,'' where  
contestant Charles Van Doren was asked to identify the main 
Balearic Islands (huh?) and explain the process of photosynthesis 
(hmm). He did it! 
</P>
<P>
	In its February 1957 cover story on Van Doren, Time magazine  
marveled at the ``fascinating, suspense-taut spectacle of his 
highly trained mind at work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By then, he was a megastar and a ratings sensation. This  
attractive young Columbia University instructor would make 14 
electrifying appearances on ``Twenty-One'' in late 1956 and early 
'57, vanquishing 13 competitors and winning a then-record $129,000.

	``Just by being himself,'' trilled Time, ``he has enabled a  
giveaway show, the crassest of lowbrow entertainments, to whip up a 
doting mass audience for a new kind of TV idol -- of all things, an 
egghead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it was all too good to be true. As the 1994 film  
``Quiz Show'' poignantly depicted, the very smart Van Doren 
outsmarted himself as a TV personality. Prepped with answers to 
those knotty questions, he was party to a deception, as were the 
producers and many fellow contestants of ``Twenty-One'' and other, 
similarly rigged quiz shows. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of 1958, all those high-stakes quizzes had been  
banished. Van Doren was disgraced. And the American people were 
disillusioned to learn that the TV champion they thought they knew 
had been playing a scripted role. 
</P>
<P>
	No danger of that on ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire,'' where no  
one pretends to be a genius. Not even the series' very first 
contestant, David Korotkin, a member of the high-IQ group Mensa. 
This would-be millionaire flubbed his seventh question. He took 
home $1,000.

<HEADLINE> Bennett To Start at QB for UCLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Drew Bennett, a junior who has attempted only  
11 passes during his career at UCLA, will start at quarterback for 
the 16th-ranked Bruins in their season-opener against Boise State 
on Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA coach Bob Toledo also announced after Monday morning's  
practice that freshman Cory Paus will serve as Bennett's backup and 
definitely play against Boise State. 
</P>
<P>
	Cade McNown, now a member of the Chicago Bears, started the last  
43 games at quarterback for the Bruins, and 44 of 47 in his career. 
As McNown's backup, Bennett was 3-of-6 for 52 yards and one 
touchdown two years ago, and 3-of-5 for 24 yards and one TD last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, who entered summer drills as UCLA's first-string  
quarterback, was 4-of-5 for 50 yards in a scrimmage last Saturday, 
while Paus was 5-of-9 for 55 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett is the only quarterback on the UCLA roster who has  
thrown a pass for the Bruins. Other QBs on the roster are sophomore 
Scott McEwan and freshman Ryan McCann. Paus and McCann both 
redshirted last year. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also announced Monday that wide receiver Danny Farmer  
might not play against Boise State after spraining his left ankle 
in Saturday's scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer, a 6-foot-4, 210-pounder, set several school records last  
season when he caught 58 passes for 1,274 yards and nine 
touchdowns.
