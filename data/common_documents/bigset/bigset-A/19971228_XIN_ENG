<HEADLINE> Philippine President Orders Austerity Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos on Saturday ordered the launch of an austerity program for
the government for fiscal year 1998 in the wake of the financial
turmoil sweeping much of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Ramos directed all government departments and agencies,
including state universities, government-owned and controlled
corporations and local government units, to reduce expenditures by
at least 25 percent of authorized regular appropriations.
</P>
<P>
"The current economic difficulties brought about by the peso
depreciation requires continued prudence in government fiscal
management to maintain economic stability and sustain the
country's growth momentum," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos stressed the need for all government units "to adopt cash
management measures to match expenditures with available
resources."
</P>
<P>
He ordered the suspension of a series of activities for
government units, including establishment of new agencies, most
capital or infrastructure projects and foreign trips by government
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Ramos asked government agencies to report on the estimated
savings generated from the austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
The peso has fallen by 52 percent from 26.2 pesos to 40 pesos
to the dollar. Analysts and international organizations expect the
Philippine economy to further slow down in 1998 as a result of the
financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Unaccountably Miss HKSAR Handball Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian team scheduled to
arrive here for their delayed appearance at the 1st Hong Kong
Special Administration Region (SAR) International Handball
Tournament failed to turn up even when it was time for them to
play on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the whereabouts of the Nigerians. We've just lost
contact with them," said Chan Tak-yau, chairman of the Hong Kong
Handball Association (HKHA) Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the HKHA were informed, after numerous changes to
the travel schedule, that the Nigerians were to arrive here Friday
evening. But the Nigerians failed to turn up at the Kai Tak
airport, with HKHA officials waiting in vain for more than three
hours.
</P>
<P>
The tournament organizers had to cancel two of the three group
matches for Saturday which involved the Nigerian team.
</P>
<P>
"We'd feel it hard even to consider inviting them again in the
future," said an upset HKHA official. "They should have at least
informed us if they had any problem, say, on applying for a visa
on time," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was invited here for the first time.
</P>
<P>
China beat Macao 27-13 after leading 12-3 at half-time, in the
only other match in the Kowloon Park Indoor Games Hall here.
</P>
<P>
China won Group A with two straight wins, followed by Hong
Kong, China with one win and one loss, and Macao with two losses.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland of Group B downed Slovenia 37-23 on Friday, which
came out the only match of the group. Switzerland thus won the
group and Slovenia came second, with the other member of the group
Nigeria missing.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, China play Switzerland for tournament title, and
Hong Kong face Slovenia for the third place.
</P>
<P>
Macao, with no opponents to play in the next stage, has
actually taken the fifth place of the four-day tournament.

<HEADLINE> Iran: Ready for Dialog With Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said here today that Iran welcomes
dialog with its neighboring states to foster regional cooperation
and friendship.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Iran's official news agency IRNA,
Mohammadi said that reinforcement of relations with the
neighboring states, including the members of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC), tops the agenda of Iran's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the timetable for the reported visit to
the United Arab Emirates of Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has not been finalized so far.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Kharrazi would started his tour to
Abu Dhabi soon after the end of the GCC summit held in Kuwait a
week ago. At the summit, the GCC leaders announced their support
for talks between Iran and the UAE to solve their territorial
disputes over three islands in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and the UAE announced to have full sovereignty over
the islands of Abu Musa, the Greater and the Lesser Tunbs at the
mouth of the strategic Hormoz Strait. Tehran took over the islands
after the British forces withdrew from the region in 1971.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the UAE President Zayed Bin Sultan
Al-Nahyan has agreed with the proposal of his Iranian
counterpart Mohammad Khatami to hold bilateral talks to solve
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
"We have attached special importance to our relations with the
Islamic states and are willing to settle mutual issues in parallel
with developing bilateral or multi-lateral cooperation with them,"
Mohammadi said.
</P>
<P>
He said the summit of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) held here on December 9-11 has led to a
common sense of cooperation in the region, serving the
security and the interests of the regional nations.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Increase Import Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government has
decided to impose import quotas and increase import duties
in a bid to protect its domestic market.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Russian Ministry of Economic
Relations and Trade, starting from January 1, 1998, Russia will
limit carpets imports from the European Union (EU) countries to 16
million square meters worth 100-110 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, higher duties will be levied on the imports of
baby food, dairy products, poultry meat, alcoholic drinks, and
second-hand and new automobiles, which have flooded the Russian
market in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Tariff on eggs imported from outside the Commonwealth of
Independent States will rise from 10 percent to 22 percent and
those on alcoholic drinks from 15-26 percent to 180-185 percent,
duties on imported second-hand automobiles will double.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Russian customs authorities said that Russia
lost 700 million U.S. dollars in the past year as EU levied
anti-dumping taxes and high customs duties on some of Russian
products.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, with large amount of commodities flooding in from EU
countries, two thirds of the food markets in big Russian cities
have been dominated by foreign products and over 90 percent of
color TV sets sold in Russia are imported ones.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Russia will lower about one third of import
duties on new automobiles and stop taxation on imported
unprocessed diamonds in an effort to gain an early entry into the
World Trade Organization and an integration into the international
economic system and to enhance the quality of the products of the
domestic industries.

<HEADLINE> Some 100,000 Bosnian Refugees Repatriated From Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- About 100,000 among a total of
350,000 Bosnian war refugees living in Germany have returned home
in 1997, a German press report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Dietmar Schlee, the German government's envoy
for refugee affairs, as saying that about 170,000 to 180,000 of
the 250,000 Bosnian refugees remaining in Germany are from the
Serb Republic of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the republic was so "miserable" that
repatriation operations must be combined with reconstruction
programs, said Schlee in an interview with the German Frankfurter
Rundschau newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The number of Bosnian refugees absorbed by Germany since 1992
are far more than that accepted by any other European countries.
</P>
<P>
However, uneasy with the heavy financial burden of hosting the
refugees, which was estimated at 3 billion U.S. dollars a year,
local German authorities have mounted increasing pressure this
year on the refugees to return home voluntarily. Otherwise, they
could face deportations.
</P>
<P>
But Germany's hard-line repatriation plans have met with strong
criticism, not only from the refugees, but also from the United
States. The latter called on Germany early this year not to
repatriate those refugees for fear of possible ethnic violence in
the republic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German officials insisted that since the fighting
had stopped, Bosnian refugees should return home to participate in
the rebuilding of their country.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijani Prime Minister
Artur Rasizade said Azerbaijan will not be influenced by any
other country in determining the route of pipelines for the
Caspian Sea oil.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted Rasizade as saying in Georgia
Saturday, "Azerbaijan will choose one that will not only meet the
political but also economic needs of its own."
</P>
<P>
The United States has pressured Kazakhstan to shelve a plan for
pipeline through Iran in favor of a U.S. backed pipeline through
Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey to the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Georgian Defense Minister Niko
Lekishvili, the prime minister said that the two countries will
turn into flourishing states in the near future following the
development of the Caspian Sea energy resources and establishment
of the Euro-Asian transportation Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey to
the Mediterranean Sea.

<P>
Rasizade arrived in Georgia on Friday for a two-day official
visit. During his visit, the two countries agreed to build a

<HEADLINE> Law Enforcement Urged in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Interior Minister
Abdollah Nouri today called for efforts to confront any illegal
actions and measures in the society, implying a control of the
recent politics-related disorder.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a nationwide gathering of governors general, Nouri
said the constitution underlines respect for the rights and
opinions of the people, therefore, any personal taste should not
influence the enforcement of laws.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, some political factions in quarrels about
different political views have announced and carried out their
"sentence" by themselves, leading to violent clashes among
supporters in some provinces which left people dead.
</P>
<P>
The situation has aroused great concern of the government and
President Mohammad Khatami, who promised freedom of speech for the
people during the May presidential elections campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said Friday that the only way to ensure a sound social
order is to accept laws as the basis of governing the nation.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Khatami's idea, Nouri stressed the constitutional
rights of political, social and economic freedoms as well as
respect for people's dignity and honor.
</P>
<P>
He also said that political development is among a priority for
the interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the
late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and in line with the guidelines
of the supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei, the Interior Ministry
will do its utmost to serve justice in the society, Nouri
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran has raised commercial
imports duties from 4.2 percent to 10 percent, Commerce Minister
Mohammad Shariatmadar announced today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA quoted Shariatmadar as saying
the Iranian cabinet's decision became effective on December 22.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the rate increase would not affect the
import of basic commodities and the raw material for
pharmaceutical as well as industrial products. Presently, 70
percent of the imports are not subject to new commercial duties,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Changing commercial duties are within the jurisdiction of the
cabinet while any adjustments in customs tariffs have to be
approved by Majlis (parliament), Shariatmadar explained.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the rate change would have a positive impact on
domestic industries, adding that the government expects a revenue
of 2,500 billion rials (833 million U.S. dollars) from commercial
duties in the budget of the new Iranian fiscal year (starts on
March 21).

<HEADLINE> PNA Urges Israel to Implement Security Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has urged the Israeli government to implement the
joint security agreement and confiscate weapons from Jewish
settlers, Jerusalem Media and Communication Center (JMCC) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The PNA considered as a serious provocative act the planned
attempt by two radical Jewish settlers to throw a pig's head
wrapped in pages of the Koran into the Al-Aqsa Mosque in East
Jerusalem during the upcoming Muslim's holy month of Ramadan
starting next week.
</P>
<P>
This is one reason why the PNA asking for the implementation of
the joint security agreement reached between the Israel and the
PNA, JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
The joint security agreement, also called the memorandum of
understanding, was reached by the security chiefs of the PNA and
Israel in association with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
representatives on December 17.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Arafat has already approved this
document, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on
Wednesday that it is unacceptable and he will not sign it.
</P>
<P>
The two radical Jewish settlers have already been arrested by
the Israeli police for their controversial plan of action.
</P>
<P>
The plan has caused furious reaction from the PNA side. PNA
Minister of Islamic Waqf Sheikh Hassan Tahboub today warned of the
dangers of this plan and held the Israeli government completely
responsible for any future acts.
</P>
<P>
PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat said in Gaza today that this plan,
if being carried out, would totally destroy the Middle East peace
process. He urged the Israeli government to consider seriously the
consequences of such acts if they occur.
</P>

LONDON, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A leading pro-British
militiaman was shot dead today by Irish National Liberation Army
(INLA) inmates at Belfast's Maze prison.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen opened fire from the roof of an H-Block around 10:00
this morning, hitting top Loyalist Volunteer Force paramilitary
Bill Wright five times in the back, according to reports from
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Three INL'a gunmen surrendered to the police after the shooting
and two guns were recovered.
</P>
<P>
Prison authorities are already looking into how guns were
brought into the jail to murder Wright.
</P>
<P>
The shooting is another serious breach of security at the jail
and intensifies pressure for a stricter regime.

The Maze is one of Northern Ireland's biggest jails with tight
security.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Telephone Industry Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Strong economy and new
technology have stimulated the development of the telephone
industry in the United States with household cellular phone
penetration expected to grow to 53.2 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The penetration rate at 1997 is 25.8 percent, reported local
newspaper Investor's Business Daily today, citing private
statistics and figures of the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
Telephone is forecast to reach 105.5 million homes in 2000 from
102.1 million in 1997. The latest edition of World Almanac put
total U.S. households at 91,947,410 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the number of local telephone lines grew 4 percent to
172 million, while phone use soared by 5 percent to chalk a
revenue of 108 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
About 20 percent of homes now have a second telephone line, up
from 3 percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Cellular phone customers numbered 40 million in 1996 and the
market is growing much faster than expected.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. Congress passed telecommunications reform two
years ago, the 262-billion-dollar-plus phone and cable TV market
has been opened to competition.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the situation, the local phone industry has
invested 20 billion dollars a year in basic network systems.
</P>
<P>
Three of the largest mergers in U.S. corporate history have
taken place in the wake of the reform, with U.S. second largest
telephone company MCI agreeing in November to be acquired by U.S.
fourth largest long-distance telephone firm WorldCom in a 37
billion dollar deal.
</P>
<P>
Expected to cover 2 million customers, the unprecedented merger
in U.S. history may pose challenges to other telecommunications
companies.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Calls for Respect of Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei today urged the country's officials to
"meticulously carry out their duties with total respect for the
laws."
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the country's governors general, Khamenei
said the establishment of a "highly promoted lawful society" is
among the noblest goals announced by the new government headed by
President Mohammad Khatami, Iran's official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the Iranian leader made the remarks in
response to recent violent actions taken by some radical political
factions against their rivals and what they dislike.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that several offices of political factions were
stormed by their rivals in recent months and some cinemas in
Isfahan and Amol were attacked by radicals in a protest to the
screening of the controversial film the Snowmen, which was
believed to be against Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
The violence has aroused great concern of the government of
Khatami, who promised freedom of expression for the people during
the May presidential elections campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei urged the government officials to combat actions which
will widen factional differences.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the prestige of the governors general
emanate from the constitution, so they should not allow personal
motives and sentiments to obstruct the execution of the duties
mandated by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Khatami also called for law enforcement, saying a
law-oriented society will ensure social stability and progress.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the only way to ensure a sound social order is
to accept laws as the basis of governing the nation.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Ready to Export Oil Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Mohammed Rashid today asserted his country's readiness to export
crude oil to world markets soon after the ratification of the new
food distribution plan from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The oil reservoirs in the seaports of Iraq's Bakr and Turkey's
Ceyhan are ready for the export and contain large quantities of
oil, Rashid told reporters after talks with Jordanian Minister of
Energy and Mineral Resources Mohamed Saleh Hourani here.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq will give priority to the oil firms of friendly
countries in signing deals under the third stage of the
oil-for-food deal with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The oil purchase contracts will be similar to those signed
between Iraq and world oil firms in the first and second stages of
the deal, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, which came into force a year ago, Iraq is
allowed to pump 1 million barrels of oil per day to get 2 billion
U.S. dollars every six months to buy medicines and other
humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
Iraq earlier announced that it will not export oil until it
receives ratification from the U.N. for the new food distribution
plan for the third phase of the deal.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi oil minister held the U.S. administration responsible
for obstructing the implementation of the oil-for-food deal and
the delay in the arrival of foodstuffs and medicines to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jordanian minister said that Jordan this year
received 4.2 million tonnes of Iraqi crude oil and by-products,
which represents 7 percent growth over the quota of last year.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have agreed on several oil projects under the
protocol on cooperation of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi experts also took part in the updating of a Jordanian
oil field and the building of a pipeline for carrying Iraqi oil
to Jordan and a refining plant in Al-Aqaba, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Hourani added that Jordan hopes to increase its imports of
Iraqi crude oil and by-products by 7 per cent next year to meet
its domestic needs.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Qatar has stopped renewing
work contracts for Egyptians occupying sensitive posts in Qatar
since ties between the two countries began fraying in November,
the Qatari News Agency (QNA) said today.
</P>
<P>
"Contracts for about 500 Egyptians working for the armed
forces, the Emir's palace, the intelligence services and in some
cases, Qatar University, were not renewed when they expired," the
QNA said.
</P>
<P>
Qatar relies on skillful and experienced foreign manpower in
many sectors and two-thirds of its 600,000 population are
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Egyptians began losing their jobs after the beginning of the
crisis between the two countries, triggered by a war of words on
November's Middle East and North Africa economic conference which
was hosted by Doha but boycotted by Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The two countries appeared to have reconciled their
differences at a December 3 summit in Riyadh sponsored by Saudi
Arabia. But the bilateral relations still remain cool.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Kenya's Major Opposition Candidates for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Michael Kijana Wamalwa and
Raila Odinga, leaders of Kenya's two major opposition parties --
FORD-Kenya and National Development Party (NDP), are seen as two
of the "Big Five" in Kenya's 1997 15-member presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Their chances of winning the presidency in Monday's poll are
slim in contrast with those of incumbent President Daniel arap
Moi, Democratic Party chief Mwai Kibaki and Social Democratic
Party's female hopeful Charity Ngilu but much more brilliant than
the rest 10.
</P>
<P>
Official leader of the opposition and a lawmaker, Wamalwa is
regarded as one of the finest orators in the parliament in the
eastern African country. His FORD-Kenya is the only party in the
country with a parliamentary representative in each province.
</P>
<P>
He once was said the darling of Kenyan youth and intellectuals
but lost many of his own supporters in the past two years due to
his pro-government stance in a number of high profile political
scandals.
</P>
<P>
When he was the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, he
absolved Kamlesh Pattni of involvement in the export compensation
scandal in which about 330 million U.S. Dollars went missing.
</P>
<P>
Later he said Ketan Somaia, another Kenyan businessman of
Asian descent, need not appear before the committee to account
for alleged failure to carry out a seven-million-Dollar contract.
</P>
<P>
He thereafter was thought by many people to have been in
secret deals with the government over these and other matters.
</P>
<P>
His party is seen to be dominated mainly by his fellow
tribesmen, the Baluhyas. As a result, he has got much of Luhya
support in Western Province, part of the Rift Valley, Nyanza,
Nairobi and the Coast. Luhya is the third largest tribe in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Born to a wealthy family in Kitale, western Kenya, in
November, 1944, he gained a degree in law from King's College,
Cambridge in 1968 and a Master degree in international law from
the London School of Economics and then lectured in law at
Nairobi University from 1970 to 1976.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, a 30-year-old Wamalwa contested the Kitale West
parliamentary seat in Rift Valley Province but failed. It was at
that time he was nicknamed "Kijana" ("youth" in Kiswahili),
implying that he was still too young to make it in politics.
</P>
<P>
He won the seat in 1979. In 1988, he became a parliamentary
member for Saboti and was appointed as the Parliamentary
Secretary of the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU), then
the sole legal political party in the country.
</P>
<P>
After the introduction of pluralism in 1991, Wamalwa became
the second vice-chairman of the original FORD (Forum for the
Restoration of Democracy) in September 1992. When the party split
afterwards, he joined Raila Odinga's faction FORD-Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Wamalwa was confirmed as the chairman of FORD-Kenya in January
1997 when finally he defeated Odinga in the inner-party power
struggle. Odinga then quit FORD-Kenya and joined the SDP.
</P>
<P>
Like Wamalwa, Odinga's support is also mainly from his own
tribesmen -- he commands broad support in western Kenya,
especially among young people from his Luo tribe, the second
largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Second son of Kenya's first Vice President and "Father of the
Kenyan Opposition" Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, Raila was born in
Maseno, Kisumu, Nyanza Province in January, 1945.
</P>
<P>
Winning a high school scholarship in 1961 to study in the then
East Germany, he attended the Herder Institute and thereafter the
Magdeburg College of Advanced Technology, graduating in 1970 with
a Master degree in mechanical engineering.
</P>
<P>
On return to Kenya, he became an assistant lecturer in
mechanical engineering at Nairobi University and later got
involved in his father's business as the managing director of a
factory making gas cylinders.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, he founded Applied Engineering Services, a consulting
firm specializing in industrial projects consultancy and
municipal engineering.
</P>
<P>
He has been detained three times by the Moi government. The
first was in 1982 with charges of planning the failed Air Force
coup to topple Moi's rule.
</P>
<P>
In September 1988, seven months after his release, he was
again picked up without charge. He was set free in June 1989,
only to be re-arrested in July 1990 and held for 11 months for
alleged involvement with the Kenya Revolutionary Movement.
</P>
<P>
After the third detention which occurred during the height of
the agitation for multi-partyism, he fled to Norway in October,
1991 following a wave of attacks and harassment by state security
personnel.
</P>
<P>
He returned in February 1992 and was elected the vice chairman
of FORD. When FORD was soon afterwards split into FORD-Kenya and
FORD-Asili, he was elected deputy director of elections in the
former before he quit in January.
</P>
<P>
He was a prominent member of the National Convention Executive
Council (NCEC), the umbrella body of the opposition set up in
April which successfully organized nationwide strikes and rallies
to press the government for minimum constitutional reforms before
the elections.
</P>
<P>
"Having been born in a political family, politics to me is a
way of life," Odinga said.

LAGOS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A group of Nigerian businessmen
plan to establish a plastic-making industry in Liberia under a
joint venture agreement, the Liberia-Nigeria Chamber of Commerce
said today.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study is also being carried out to facilitate
the establishment of a sugar factory and a tea-blending industry
in that country, according to the chamber's president Chief
Anthony Anyaso.
</P>
<P>
The business leader, who has just returned from a business
trip to Liberia, was quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria as
saying that the chamber plans to exploit the abundant tea and
rubber plantations in Liberia to improve business relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Anyaso, Nigerian businessmen would assist their
Liberian counterparts by teaching them through apprenticeship and
appointing them as distributing agents of Nigerian companies.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Liberian business community is dominated by
Lebanese who are not interested in investing there, he said that
the aim of the chamber is to install Liberian businessmen in a
position to control business in their country.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Nigerians who had nothing good to offer Liberia
to desist from going there, saying that anybody who wanted to get
rich quick should not do so by tarnishing Nigeria's image.

PARIS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- French Minister in Charge of
Relations with Parliament, Daniel Vaillant, said today that there
is no "sword of Damocles" of a dissolution of government by
President Jacques Chirac, who is cohabiting with the Socialists.

Vaillant was responding to a statement made last week by former

condition suitable for a dissolution.

the action of the prime minister and government," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Arms Export Not Failure in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian arms export which
amount 844 million rubles in 1997 was satisfactory, though the
hard-currency profit diminished slightly in the first half of the
year, the Interfax reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration Alexei Ogaryov
denied reports that Russian arms exports were a complete failure
this year.
</P>
<P>
Ogaryov said "All the talks about Russia's failure on the arms
market are based on an erroneous assessment of Russia's actual
share in the world arms exports."
</P>
<P>
He quoted other sources, including the London International
Institute of Strategic Studies, as putting Russia on the fourth
place on the arms market.
</P>
<P>
According to the institute, Russia's share in the world arms
trade in 1997 is likely to go on to 8.6 percent, while the global
turnover is expected to increases by 10 percent compared to 1996.
The share of the United States is estimated at 43 percent, Britain
- 22 percent and France - 14 percent.

<HEADLINE> HK to Slaughter Chickens to Fight "Bird Flu" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
said on Sunday that it will slaughter all chickens in local
chicken farms and all poultry at wholesale markets and retail
outlets in an attempt to get rid of the source of influenza A H5N1
virus or "bird flu."
</P>
<P>
The move is being taken following the discovery of the H5N1
virus in samples taken from a local chicken farm and the sudden
death of chickens at a wholesale poultry market.
</P>
<P>
The operation would begin on Monday, said Stephen Ip, secretary
for Economic Services, at a press conference here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It will cover all chicken farms, mixed poultry farms, wholesale
markets, market stalls and fresh provision shops in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the extension of the mass slaughter to all
poultry at wholesale markets and retail outlets was necessary
because the birds were being kept together and cross-infection
could not be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
There are 160 chicken farms and 39 mixed poultry farms in Hong
Kong. The number of fresh provision shops and market stalls
operating under the two municipal councils is about 430 and 560
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Ip said that as an extra precaution against infection, the
Municipal Council and the Housing Department will jointly launch a
massive and thorough cleansing exercise at all market stalls after
the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Chan, director of Health, said her department will
"provide health checks for chicken farmers, retailers and poultry
workers."
</P>
<P>
"It will also step up the medical surveillance program and
increase the provision of out-patient services in respect of the
avian flu," she added.
</P>
<P>
Chan stressed that the cluster of cases of human influenza A
H5N1 seen in Hong Kong is no indication of an epidemic. According
to the World Health Organization, there is no need for travel
restrictions in Hong Kong or elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
There are now 12 confirmed cases and eight suspected cases of
"bird flu" in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> India to Launch One Satellite Every Year Till 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Space Research
Organization (ISRO) plans to launch one remote sensing satellite
every year till 2002, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The remote sensing satellite will be launched by using
indigenously developed payloads from India's own launch pads, PTI
said, quoting the project director of ISRO's Indian remote sensing
program, Dr. S. Kalayanaraman.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of launching one such satellite every year is to
maintain continuity in service since the life period of a
satellite is approximately three years. The satellite will be
useful for various fields of study and research with remote
sensing methods.
</P>
<P>
The next remote sensing satellite in the Indian remote
satellite (IRS) series, IRS-p4, to be launched next year, will be
an operational satellite taking care of oceanographic studies. It
will scan ocean, study water heights and wave movements, gather
data on coastlines and have limited land applications.
</P>
<P>
IRS-p5, to be launched in 1999, will concentrate on
cartographic studies. It will also be useful in urban planning,
Kalayanaraman said.

<HEADLINE> Exchange Rates of Renminbi Yuan To Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) --The exchange rates of Renminbi
yuan will remain stable and will not be forced to change due to
negative effects of the recent financial turmoil in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to an article published last week by Economic Daily,
one of the major Chinese official papers, the recent financial
crisis in Southeast and East Asia has seriously devalued many
major currencies.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Baht was depreciated by nearly 50 percent, with both
the Indonesian Rupiah and the Republic of Korea's Won devaluated
by more than 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The currency of China's Taiwan island was also devalued by 20
percent, even though it has a large foreign exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that exchange rate changes will not only affect
China's exports to Southeast and East Asia, but also comparatively
increase their cost of importing China-made products.
</P>
<P>
Some have concluded that it is unfavorable for China to export
its labor-intensive products if the yuan is not devalued and its
exchange rates remain unchanged. Southeast Asian states could be
more competitive after devaluation of their currencies.
</P>
<P>
However, exchange rates for the yuan have not fallen since the
beginning of the Southeast Asia financial turmoil. The Chinese
Renminbi has maintained a stable exchange rate against major
overseas currencies.
</P>
<P>
From July to October, when Southeast Asia was badly hit by
speculation in financial markets, China's foreign exchange reserve
increased by 17 billion U.S. dollars, which drove the country's
total up to 137.9 billion U.S. dollars at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of Renminbi with the U.S. dollar in
mid-August was 8.29-to-1. However, it remained at 8.2796-to-1 at
the end of November.

<HEADLINE> Exchange Rates of Yuan To Remain Stable (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few believe that the Renminbi will be devalued, according to
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
First, unlike most Southeast Asian states, China does not have
an imbalance in current accounts, which would directly lead to
devaluation of the Chinese yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's exchange rates are mainly influenced by macro-economic
control measures at home, and not necessarily by the adjustment of
exchange rates by Southeast Asian states.
</P>
<P>
If China continues its moderately tight financial policy and
avoids risks of an overheated domestic demand, the paper said, the
country should maintain a balanced account of foreign trade next
year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China has lowered bank interest rates three times
since early 1996, and the inflation rate has remained at a low
level because of China's successful economic soft-landing.
</P>
<P>
All these factors will help improve the competitiveness of
Chinese export enterprises, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Also, China's foreign trade surplus will exceed 40 billion
U.S. dollars by the end of this year, which will protect China's
foreign trade industry from being seriously hurt by market
changes, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Southeast Asian states need time to rein in their
fluctuating exchange rates, and the rising interest rates and
inflation rate, which will undermine their efforts to increase
exports.
</P>
<P>
Even if China's foreign trade was affected, the country would
have no deficit in current accounts next year.

<P>
Second, it is impossible that the escape of overseas investment
from China would cause devaluation of the Renminbi yuan, the paper
said. Overseas investors still favor the business opportunities in
the China market, and are confident in China's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
China has maintained a steady economic growth during recent
years, and the improved investment environment will help the
country pool funds for construction of infrastructure projects and
attract overseas investments.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, direct overseas cash flow to
China has been increasing in recent years although the country's
contractual overseas investment is declining.
</P>
<P>
From January to October the total overseas investment in China
reached 41.9 billion U.S. dollars, up 26.9 percent from the same
period last year. Direct overseas investment accounted for nearly
80 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Most of the overseas direct investments have long-term targets,
which lowers the risks of a sudden flight of overseas investment
from China.
</P>
<P>
Third, rumors about possible devaluation of Renminbi at home
will not influence market supply and demand much, the paper said,
because the Chinese yuan can only be freely converted under
current accounts and the country tightly controls capital inflow
and outflow.
</P>
<P>
The limited convertibility prevents China from being hurt by
speculators in the international financial market. That is also
why China has survived the financial turmoils in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rates of the yuan were decided by the market after
China reformed its system in 1994. The central bank, the People's
Bank of China, can only prevent sharp changes in the exchange
rates.
</P>
<P>
It is impossible for the central bank to take the full risk of
devaluing the yuan while ignoring market trends, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It is reasonable to believe that the exchange rates of Chinese
yuan will remain stable, but the paper warned that market dealers
must make rational judgements.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's FM Ends Visit to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Minister of
State for Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh left Riyadh today
after his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia aimed at breaking the
deadlocked Middle East peace process and boosting bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Saudi Arabia, Tarawneh met with King Fahd
Bin Abdula Aziz and Crown Prince Abdallah and delivered a message
from King Hussein to Fahd on the stagnant Middle East Peace
process and its negative implications on peace and stability in
the region.
</P>
<P>
He also held talks with his Saudi counterpart Prince Saud
Al-Faisal on issues related to the staled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers conducted a full evaluation of the
dangers facing the Middle East peace march in light of Israel's
ignorance of international efforts to compel it to return to the
peace track, according to Kuwait News Agency (KUNA).
</P>
<P>
They expressed their countries' increasing concern over the
continuing Israeli hard-line policy against the Arabs and its
refusal to implement the peace agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
They expressed hope that the Israeli government would be aware
of its policy's repercussions and its unilateral vision of
security, the KUNA quoted diplomatic sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
They called on the international community, especially the
United States and Russia, to exert pressure against Israel. The
two countries share the same view regarding the Middle East peace
process which is based on the principle of land-for-peace and
U.N. resolutions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Their talks also dealt with means of boosting bilateral ties,
especially in the economic, commercial and investments fields.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh's visit follows the official visit to Saudi Arabia by
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan in September.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Saudi Arabia and Jordan have been improving
in recent years after several years' strain following the Gulf
War in 1991 when Amman stood on the side of Iraq while Saudi
Arabia was one of the allies led by the U.S. to liberate Kuwait
from Iraqi seven-month occupation.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is Jordan's second largest trading partner after
Iraq. In 1996, Jordan exported about 184 million U.S. dollars
worth of goods to Saudi Arabia compared to 99 million U.S.
dollars in 1995, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Under a trade protocol, the two countries are expected to
set up a free trade zone by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> 9 Million Kenyans Set to Vote in Monday's General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 9,030,141
registered Kenyan voters are expected to cast their ballots
across the country on Monday to decide who will be the fittest
person to lead the eastern African country into next millennium.
</P>
<P>
One president, 210 parliamentary members and 2,955 local
councillors will be elected on Monday's second democratic
multi-party general elections in Kenya with a population of
around 28 million.
</P>
<P>
In the most crowded presidential race since the country declared
independence in 1963, 15 people were registered as
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, 73 and in power
for 19 years, is widely expected to win his last campaign with
another five year term.
</P>
<P>
His powerful rivals include Mwai Kibaki of Democratic Party of
Kenya, Wamalwa Kijana of FORD-Kenya, Raila Odinga of National
Development Pary of Kenya, Charity Ngilu of Social Democratic
Party and Martin Shikuku of FORD-Asili.
</P>
<P>
Ngilu and Wangari Maathai from Liberal Party of Kenya are the
first women ever to vie for the highest political office in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Oludhe's Economic Independence Party, established late
last month, is the youngest party in the race, and Moi's
37-year-old KANU (Kenya African National Union) is the oldest.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates are Munyua Waiyaki of United Patriotic Party
of Kenya, George Anyona of Kenya Social Congress, Kimani wa
Nyoike of FORD-People, Koigi Wamwere of Kenda, David Ng'ethe of
Umma Patriotic Party of Kenya, Godfrey M'Mwireria of Green
African Party, and Katama Mkangi of Kenya National Congress.
</P>
<P>
A presidential aspirant can be qualified as he (she) gets the
mandatory 1,000 signatures of supporters, but to be a legal Kenyan
president needs no less than 25 percent votes in at least five of
the country's eight provinces. He (she) must also get the highest
total.
</P>
<P>
If no candidate meets that condition, there will be a run-off
between the two top-placed candidates within 21 days of the
announcement of final results from the first ballot and the 25
percent rule will still apply.
</P>
<P>
For the parliamentary election, about 883 candidates from 23
parties are taking part in the race to the eighth parliament. The
candidate with the highest number of votes in each constituency
wins. KANU have already got 13 seats unopposed.
</P>
<P>
There are 8,466 candidates standing for elections in 2,955
local wards.
</P>
<P>
Voting will be carried out in as many as 12,754 polling
stations in 210 constituencies. All the polling stations are due
to open at 6:00 a.m. and close at 6:00 p.m. (0300-1500 GMT).
</P>
<P>
It is unable to predict when partial or final results will
be known. However, local observers say the results may come
in two or three days after the polling.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sino-Japanese Cooperation Fruitful (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The overall development of
economic, scientific and technological cooperation between the
Chinese and Japanese governments focusing on using Japan's
Official Development Assistance (ODA) has been fruitful since
China's reform and opening-up drive was initiated two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Economists here say that such cooperative projects have yielded
good economic and social results which have contributed to China's
development and played a positive role in promoting Sino-Japanese
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Since Japanese Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira voiced his
support for helping China in its modernization drive during his
visit to China in 1979, China has become one of the key countries
receiving ODA. The Japanese government aims at strengthening
economic cooperation with foreign countries, through such
assistance in the form of loans, aid and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China started using Japanese government loans through the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan in 1979 to purchase
equipment, materials and technologies for more than 100 projects
covering communications, energy and social infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
By 1997 the Japanese had committed to more than 2.084 trillion
yen in government loans, accounting for more than 40 percent of
such loans China has received from foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
These Japanese government loans have all been injected into
China's key projects to make up for insufficient capital in these
areas, thus promoting China's economic growth as well as the
common development of the two economies and bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, China also used Japanese export promotion program
loans of 70 billion yen for more than 280 projects in
export-oriented sectors such as light industry, textiles,
agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Along with the loans, China received 95 billion yen in Japanese
aid from 1981 to the beginning of 1997 for 80 projects in
education, medicine, agriculture, environmental protection and
social insurance.
</P>
<P>
Such aid resulted in a number of projects popular with Chinese
people such as the Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital, the
Changchun Water Treatment Plant, the water improvement project in
Guizhou and the Minjiang flood control system.

Non-governmental scientific and technological exchanges between
China and Japan started in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Since the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic ties in
1972, bilateral governmental cooperation in scientific and
technological fields started to grow.
</P>
<P>
So far, the two countries have agreed to cooperate in five
aspects under bilateral agreements on scientific and technological
cooperation, environmental protection and nuclear cooperation,
technological cooperation through the Japanese International
Cooperation Agency and cooperation between different departments
of the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Under the bilateral scientific and technological cooperation
agreement, China and Japan have cooperated on more than 170
projects covering such fields as agriculture, metallurgy,
oceanography, meteorology, the environmental, disaster-prevention,
earthquakes, desert, biology and astronomy.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral technological cooperation has resulted in feasibility
studies for more than 70 large projects and investigation for
modernization of more than 70 medium-size enterprises across
China.
</P>
<P>
So far, Sino-Japanese scientific and technological cooperation
has grown from sending personnel to study in Japan and inviting
Japanese experts to China, to providing facilities and
documentation for China.
</P>
<P>
This year is the 25th anniversary of the normalization of
Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Leaders of the two governments
have exchanged visits, and have spoken highly of bilateral
economic relations.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Urged to Focus on Education, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
been urged to focus its 1998 budget in the four areas of
education, health, agriculture and energy, the Guardian reported
today.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of a sample survey conducted by the
newspaper in Lagos State last week, when 705 usable responses
were derived out of 1,000 interviews.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 73.3 percent of the randomly selected
adult citizens want the government to give topmost attention to
education in next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
For 51.8 percent of them, the government has been urged to
give lion's share of the 1998 budget to the provision of
qualitative health care and improved health care facilities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 37.7 of them would rather prefer the government to
prioritize agriculture in next year's budget so as to supply
abundant food supply for the people and export, thereby reducing
the country's overdependence on crude oil as the mainstay of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
About 22.8 of the respondents want the new budget to put more
funds in revamping the energy sector, while 20.6 percent called
on the government to devote the biggest chunk of the 1998 budget
to employment generation and creation of employment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Other areas that caught the attention of the respondents
include improvement of the life of the rural populace (12.1
percent) and transportation (12.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted between December 18 and 22, also covers
such areas as road construction and rehabilitation, petroleum and
the value of the national currency, women's affairs,
telecommunications, defense, information, youth, prisons and
culture.
</P>
<P>
Another finding of the survey is that Nigerians are still
indifferent to the killer disease AIDS, as only 2.6 percent of
the respondents want more fund to be devoted to AIDS and other
sexually transmitted diseases in next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, however, the survey reveals that as much as 58.3
percent of the respondents are skeptical of the government's
promise to release the 1998 budget by December 31, 1997, 30
percent of whom based their doubt on the antecedents of the
Abacha administration not to keep its promise.
</P>
<P>
While 32.5 percent believed the budget would be released
unfailingly by that date, 9.2 percent are indifferent as to
when the government might decide to release it.

operating mechanisms and management systems. A complete and modern
power industry has taken shape.
</P>
<P>
The minister made his remarks at the national power conference
held here today. He said that it is remarkable for the country's
power generation to maintain an annual average growth rate of 6.2
percent for five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
And, for 10 years running, the large and medium-size generating
units with capacity ranging from 10 million kw to 15 million kw
have been put into operation annually.
</P>
<P>
China's power industry has recorded a growth rate of 8-to-9
percent since the establishment of the ministry of electric power
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
directly under the central government have met the target of
making electricity available to every village under their
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-five percent of the country's rural population should
have access to electricity by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that with Daya Bay and Qinshan nuclear power plants
now in operation, the country's sources of electricity have been
diversified. Hydropower generating units with capacity exceeding
four million kw annually have also been put into operation.
</P>
<P>
Large generating units each with a capacity of
200,000-to-300,000 kw have become the backbone of the country's
power grids, which account for more than 40 percent of China's
total installed power generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country has succeeded in setting up a
multi-channel fund collection system for power construction, with
funds from various localities and overseas topping 170 billion
yuan for constructing large- and medium-size generating units, and
accounting for 43.1 percent of the total investment.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that the all-around reform has started in
the country's power industry to transform the traditional
operating mechanism and management system, which has been
initiated by the establishment of the China State Power
Corporation.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Globalization Highlights Economic Malaise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany, a country that has
created its economic miracle in the post-war period like a fairy
tale and emerged as an economic power in Europe, has at last
found itself in a predicament in face of globalization of the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
For dozens of years, German-made goods have been taken as the
symbol of top-quality products, which has helped German
corporations like Siemens AG march into world markets away from
home.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of heated international competition now,
Siemens says it can no longer endure the high costs of doing
business at home.
</P>
<P>
It is sending more and more investment to and creating more and
more jobs in the United States, Asia and eastern Europe, where
taxes and labor costs run much lower.
</P>
<P>
No wonder competition in the wake of globalization today
involves much more than quality.
</P>
<P>
Factors like the swiftly developing information industry,
diversified customer demands, freer flows of capitals and
sophisticated technologies have made lower costs and prices,
investments overseas and localization of production equally
crucial for key corporations to occupy markets.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey showed 28 percent of Germany's 6,000 leading
companies are planning to move their production lines abroad over
the next three years. Nearly two-thirds of them attributed this to
high domestic labor costs as the main reason.
</P>
<P>
Such an exodus helps shed light on what is described by some
German economists as the worst structural crisis for the German
economy since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
As globalization is developing in depth around the world,
Germany's welfare-oriented social market economy, once working so
soundly to help achieve its economic miracle in the 1950s and
1960s, is becoming increasingly saddled with difficulties.
</P>
<P>
This year, the country saw its unemployment rate hovering at a
postwar record high of over 11 percent, economic growth lagging
behind the average of industrialized nations, its world market
share shrinking, and a huge deficit in investment flows and an
accumulated national debt of about 2,250 billion Deutsche marks
(about 1,268.3 billion U.S. dollars), twice that in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Germany also witnessed a dropping competitiveness, which ranked
the 25th in the world last year after 22nd in 1995 and fifth in
1993, said a report from the Geneva-based World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
All these occurred coinciding with globalization and some
Germans tend to put the blame on the latter. But it is more fair
to say that it is globalization and the resulting fiercer
international competition that have highlighted Germany's
fundamental structural problems.
</P>
<P>
A worker lives more comfortably in Germany than elsewhere in
the world. He earns about 30 U.S. dollars an hour on average --
nearly twice the level in the United States and Britain, has six
week holidays each year and a month's pay in extra as Christmas
bonus.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, German companies in 1993 contributed 250
billion marks (about 141 billion dollars) to non-wage labor costs
like employees' pension, health care, and unemployment insurances,
or 7.7 percent of Germany's total social security spendings.
</P>
<P>
The comparable percentage was 4.9 percent in the United States,
5.1 percent in Japan and 3.5 percent in Britain.
</P>
<P>
On top of this were high tax levies. Corporate tax bills of
western German enterprises added up to 64.9 percent of their
profits in 1995, compared with 45.3 percent in the United States,
59.2 percent in Japan and 33 percent in Britain.
</P>
<P>
German businesses also have to cope with overly protective
labor regulations, including high minimum wages and many
restrictions on dismissing employees. The laws are so strict that
employers are just reluctant to hire new workers in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
The companies in response moved production abroad. They have
invested 216 billion marks (about 121.8 billion dollars) abroad
since 1990, thus creating 500,000 new jobs overseas.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, about two million jobs were axed during the period
in Germany, which came partly as a result of the companies'
restructuring efforts to cut costs and sharpen their competitive
edge.
</P>
<P>
The German companies are still busy with merging, focusing
themselves on core businesses and adopting more flexible working
practices just as what most U.S. corporations did in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to ease burdens on enterprises and boost investment
and employment, the German government proposed this year reform
packages to overhaul the country's taxation, pension and
health-care systems. But all have been mired in setbacks.
</P>
<P>
The tax reform has been shelved due to the dispute between
government and the major opposition Social Democrats over how to
re-distribute the tax burdens and how to make up the financial
shortfall after tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
However, it is agreed by all that the reform is a must to
restore Germany's competitive position.
</P>
<P>
However, even with all these done, it could still be far from
enough.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts also pointed out that Germany has lagged behind
the Unites States and Japan in information industry, services and
technical innovation, as well as its still relatively smaller
business presence in the newly emerging markets in Asia and South
America.
</P>
<P>
They feared these factors, if not improved, would likely put
Germany in a disadvantageous position in future competition with
its major economic rivals.
</P>
<P>
But maybe a more tough job for the country is to foster an
entrepreneurial spirit of taking risks in its people, who have for
so many years got used to a cozy cradle-to-grave welfare system.

<HEADLINE> Campus Cult Wars Kill 54 in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has recorded the death
of 54 undergraduates in institutions of higher learning
nationwide as a result of cult wars this year, the Sunday Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred students were maimed or wounded in the
violence unleashed on the campuses by the various campus cults in
their mindless rivalry and blood letting.
</P>
<P>
Although the mortality rate was of the same pattern with that
of 1996 when 46 students were killed in cold blood, the brigandry
and savagery that surrounded the campus blood letting this year
were of even more worrisome magnitude, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the Committee for the Protection of People's Dignity,
the newspaper said cult activists also gained momentum in the
secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
According to the committee, at least 70 suspected cult
militants were charged to court during the year, but only about
four cases have been decided so far.
</P>
<P>
As result, a worrisome dimension to the cult syndrome is the
increasing interest of children and wards of the elite in the
scourge, said the committee, which was established by former
President of the Students Union of the Lagos university Sowore
Omoyele.
</P>
<P>
Allegedly rusticated from the university ater mounting a
counter-attack on cult members in 1994, the former student leader
called on parents and university administrators to salvage the
situation fast.
</P>
<P>
Concerned about the increasing campus cult activities, related
authorities have taken some measures to fight against cultism.
</P>
<P>
Some students involving in cult wars have been expelled and
police squads have been stationed in some universities, including
the big-name University of Lagos, to avoid renewed clashes
between rival cult groups.

<HEADLINE> Enduring Mindanao Peace in Sight: Philippine Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have agreed to sign a
preliminary peace understanding by January 30 next year and a
final peace accord before June 30, Speaker Jose de Venecia said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia, the ruling Lakas-NUCD party's presidential
candidate for next year's elections, made the announcement here
three weeks after he and MILF Military Commander Al Haj Murad
signed a joint press statement in the rebel stronghold in Camp
Abubakar, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But the statement was brought to Manila just now and released
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the joint statement, de Venecia and Murad said the
government and MILF peace panels would expedite the ongoing talks
so that an accord on peace in Mindanao could be signed before
President Fidel Ramos steps down on June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine Constitution, Ramos is not allowed to seek
re-election after his six-year term ends on June 30.
</P>
<P>
"We are one final step away from an agreement that would
guarantee an enduring peace in Mindanao," said Speaker de Venecia.
</P>
<P>
The speaker's visit to the MILF camp in November broke the
deadlock that threatened to derail indefinitely the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the envisioned preliminary understanding, the MILF-held
areas of Buldon, Bareira and Matanog in Mindanao would be declared
as special development zones, according to a Philippine News
Agency report.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF became the major threat to peace in the
Southern Philippines after the government and the Moro National
Liberation Front, another rebel group, signed a peace accord last
year. The MILF rejected the peace agreement and continued its
fighting for an independent Muslim state.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explosion Kills Three in South Sri Lankan City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A truck-bomb exploded in the
Southern Sri Lankan city of Galle early Sunday morning, killing
three people and damaging surrounding buildings, a well-informed
source said.
</P>
<P>
The source, who is working for the Sri Lankan government, said
that the bomb explosion took place at around 2:30 Sunday morning
in the main road of the city.
</P>
<P>
The dead have been identified as three Tamils. The truck was
driven into Galle from the Eastern city of Batticaloa, where the
rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has been fighting
with government troops for an independent state of their own.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded just 200 meters away from a naval base in
Galle, a city some 115 km south of the capital Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Before the explosion, there was a music show in town which
attracted more than 4,000 people, including some Navy commandos
and the families of soldiers killed in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
When the show finished at around 0:30, some high ranking naval
officers went along with a naval commander to their base, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
No one else was killed in the incident but the blast set
several nearby houses ablaze.
</P>
<P>
Police in the city are conducting investigations, the source
said.

<HEADLINE> Smokers in California to Lose Last Refuge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Smokers who have been
chased out of every other public places in California will soon
lose their last refuge - bars.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, smoking will be prohibited in bars throughout the
the state on the U.S. west coast.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 1995, the state banned smoking in all enclosed
workplaces, with the exception of bars, card rooms, hotel lobbies
and retail tobacco shops.
</P>
<P>
Now bar owners are required to post "no smoking" signs in their
establishments, to remove ashtrays and other cigarette-enticing
artifacts, and to tell nicotine addicts that they can't light a
cigarette especially after they have fired up.
</P>
<P>
Failure to do so could results in a fine of 100 dollars for the
first time, 200 dollars for the second and 500 dollars for
subsequent violations within one year. After the third offense, an
investigation could end up with a fine of up to 7,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco alone, the ban will affect approximately 1,000
bars, nightclubs and restaurants. Some tavern owners are afraid
that when the smoke clears, they won't have many customers
left.
</P>
<P>
But others acknowledged that more and more customers are
nonsmokers. Besides, the ban may also bring new customers who
don't get into taverns just for fear of secondhand smoking.
</P>
<P>
By sitting in a smoky bar for two hours, one sucks up as many
carcinogens as in smoking four cigarettes, according to the
American Cancer Society. It is estimated that between 4,200 and
7,000 Californians, and about 53,000 Americans, die each year from
the effects of secondhand smoking.
</P>
<P>
In another development, at least one state prison inmate has
claimed that he wants a reprieve from secondhand smoking.
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit filed earlier this month, Gene Moran, serving a
three-year sentence for burglary, said that guards are not

<HEADLINE> LTTE Rebels Rocked by Scandal of High-ranking Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) has been rocked by a multi-million dollar financial
scandal which involved some of the organization's high-ranking
leaders, the Lankapuvath News Agency of Sri Lanka said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted its sources as saying that rebel leader
Velupillai Prabhakaran has discovered that some of his top aides
had swindled millions of dollars from the organization's fund.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Lawrence Thilagar, former international
spokesman for the LTTE, and Nadarajah Muraleetharan, LTTE leader
in Switzerland, were summoned by Prabhakaran to his jungle hideout
in Sri Lanka's Northeastern district of Mullaitivu recently.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, they had siphoned LTTE funds into
their secret private bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
In one single case, Thilagar was alleged to have taken 100,000
dollars out of a 500,000-dollar LTTE fund, which came from a
company that sells pirated video and audio products.
</P>
<P>
Lankapuvath said the LTTE's international financial operations
were in such a disarray that even Prabhakaran's trusted arms
dealer Kumaran Pathmanabhan has been placed under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 14-year-long ethnic war with
government troops in a bid to create a separate state of their own
in the north and east of the island nation.
</P>
<P>
The organization obtains its fund from voluntary donators and
its underground economic activities.

<HEADLINE> Omani Leader Calls for Fair Chance for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Omani Sultan Qaboos Bin Said
has underlined the need for giving a fair chance to women in all
spheres of life, local newspaper Gulf News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Saturday the joint session of the newly-appointed
41-member State Council, an advisory body to the sultan, and the
80-member Majlis al-Shura (parliament) elected last April, the
Omani leader emphasised the role of women in the Sultanate, and he
urged government sectors to grant women more jobs opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The State Council currently has four women members and the
Majlis has two. The two institutions together formed the Council
of Oman, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Oman issued in June a landmark decree allowing women across
the country to stand for election to governmental posts.
</P>
<P>
The move was considered an unprecedented event in the Islamic
country in which women's roles have always been limited to their
families.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait's Media Expect Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti newspapers have
been flooded with reports of an expected cabinet reshuffle or the
dissolving of the National Assembly during the holy month of
Ramadan due to start in a few days.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers, both Arabic and English, recently quoted
"highly-informed sources" as saying the country is on the verge of
"a big political settlement," which will lead to the resignation
of the Cabinet and exclusion of Finance Minister Nasser Al-Roudhan
in a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Despite denial by some officials of such a situation, the
newspapers give an impression that the Gulf state, which has the
only parliament in the region, will see a highly charged situation
and hectic political activity before a settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
Al-Roudhan, who passed an open parliament grilling in July over
alleged mismanagement, irregularities in handling public funds and
negligence, again fell a target of the religious groups and some
deputies who joined hands to attempt to grill the finance minister
for the second time.
</P>
<P>
Rumors have it that Al-Roudhan submitted his resignation before
the Gulf summit earlier this month, but he was asked to wait until
the meeting was over.
</P>
<P>
So far Al-Roudhan remained silent and did not refute the
resignation rumors.
</P>
<P>
The minister's alleged resignation and the strained relations
between the parliament and the government are manifestation of a
real political crisis that should no longer be ignored in the
country, many sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
So the current situation caused wide speculations about a
cabinet reshuffle and dissolving of parliament.
</P>
<P>
An article by Arab Times Editor-in-Chief Ahmed Al-Jarallah
quoted informed sources as saying that "discussions and
negotiations have been going on for the last few weeks to shape
out the reforms program," adding that "either the cabinet will
resign or the Assembly will be constitutionally dissolved."
</P>
<P>
Others, according to the newspapers, however, are of the view
that the situation does not require any "abnormal" solutions,
believing that the way out is through the resignation of the
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah was reportedly to have a plan of
appointing "strong and competent" members in the cabinet after
he returned home from a health recuperation in last September.
</P>
<P>
However, Kuwait's First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah Saturday
categorically denied reports of a possible dissolution of the
parliament and said he "did not hear" about the resignation
of the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the press for "fabricating tension" in the
country.

BEIRUT, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen passengers aboard an
Airbus 310 affiliated to Lebanese State-run Middle East Airline
were slightly wounded early this morning as the plane hit air
turbulence over Lebanon, local Orient Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic radio broadcast said that the injury was caused
because none of the 140 passengers on board fastened safety belt
when the plane, which took off from the airport of Jidda, Saudi
Arabia, was flying over a cedar district on the Lebanese hill
which was then surrounded by heavy air mass.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Leaves for Turkmenistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami left here this morning for Turkmenistan, starting his
first foreign visit since he assumed office in August.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Tehran, Khatami expressed hope that his first
foreign trip would be a source of blessing for the two nations of
Iran and Turkmenistan, saying that Iran considers itself
duty-bound to assist its neighbors, the newly independent
countries of the former Soviet Union in particular, in their
efforts toward progress.
</P>
<P>
"We must make use of the existing understanding to bring
progress, security and stability to the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's official news agency IRNA, Khatami will
hold talks with high ranking Turkmen officials and attend the
inaugural ceremony of the gas pipeline between Turkmenistan and
Iran during his two-day visit to Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
The 200-kilometer pipeline was built between the two
neighboring countries at a cost of 195 million U.S. dollars. It
passes from Turkmenistan to northern Iran and will be connected
to another pipeline to reach Europe via Turkey.
</P>
<P>
As of next year, Turkmenistan will start its gas exports
through the pipeline with an initial annual capacity of 4
billion cubic meters. Iran will fetch a good revenue through
transiting Turkmen gas to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
During Khatami's visit, the Turkmen segment of the huge
fiber optics project connecting Asia to Europe will also be
inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
The project implemented by Iran's telecommunications company in
Turkmenistan is part of the Asia-Europe fiber optics project
from Shanghai, China to Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The 23,000-kilometer optical fiber goes through China,
Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan before
entering Iran. It will be connected to Germany after passing
through Iran, Turkey and Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Hopeful of Tangible Results from G-8 on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing U.N. Special Envoy
on Afghanistan Nobert Holl expressed his hope here on Sunday that
different initiatives including those of the Group of Eight
Countries can be channeled for bringing about durable peace in the
conflict-torn country.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that different initiatives can be channeled in a
reasonable way and we can reach tangible results in foreseeable
future," Holl said in his farewell press conference, referring to
different efforts for realizing peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Holl, who relinquished his assignment as U.N. special envoy on
Afghanistan on Sunday, said that the Group of Eight Countries,
working under the U.N. and comprising six immediate neighbors of
Afghanistan and U.S. and Russia, should discuss the strategic
gains of Pakistan and Iran, the two vitally important countries,
in making peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The UN diplomat favored the role of foreign countries in making
peace in Afghanistan, declaring that past experience shows that
Afghans alone are "not capable of bringing about durable
settlement."
</P>
<P>
Holl called for materializing the idea of a broad-based
government in the strife-hit country as "it will be important in
the sense of nation building with representation from all ethnic
groups."
</P>
<P>
On former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani's recent visit
to Pakistan, Holl said, "the visit was not a competition between
the U.N. and the individual countries."
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact Pakistan has been trying to bring about a
dialogue between Afghans and with the visit of Rabbani has
established its credentials as a neutral negotiator," he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that these efforts, which have received response from
Rabbani and the Taliban, will be coordinated under the UN
umbrella.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Guo'an defeated
Shanghai Shenhua 2-1 on a late goal from substitute Nan Fang to
retain the Chinese Football Association Cup here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Beijing defender Deng Lejun headed in an own goal in the fourth
minute of the final to give Shenhua a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Paraguayan striker Casiano Delualle then netted in the area in
the 38th minute to equalize for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, who dominated the second half, mounted repeated
attacks and finally found the cracks in the Shanghai defence in
the 83rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Guo'an's another Paraguayan striker Andreas Oliuas Rubio
delivered a blast from left in the area but the shot was warded
off by the Shanghai goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
Second-half substitute Nan Fang then surged ahead and pounced
on, sending the home fans at the sold-out Workers' Stadium into
ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
Beijing coach Jin Zhiyang said, "We made good preparations for
the match. We had more chances and more shots in the second
half. We deserved the win."
</P>
<P>
He said the unexpected fielding of Deng, originally a
midfielder, in the defender position was justifiable despite his
own goal.
</P>
<P>
"He worked well to check the Shanghai strikers," Jin said. "I
thought we would have had larger advantage if the Shanghai had
weaker defence."
</P>
<P>
Xie Chaoyang and Paraguayan Jorge Luis Campos, both from
Beijing, were given yellow cards in the heated match.
</P>

Beijing beat Jinan Taishan in last year's final to win the cup
for the first time.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's NGOs to Assist with Drought Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Following reports that there
might be another drought this farming season, some Zimbabwean
non-governmental organizations are preparing to assist the
government in providing drought relief to people if need be.
</P>
<P>
According to Reverend Max Chigwida, National Director of World
Vision, a Christian organization which offers assistance to
different groups of people, his organization has spent 6.7
million Zimbabwe Dollars (480,000 U.S. Dollars) in providing
water reservoirs, seed packs of drought tolerant crops, 110 tons
of sorghum and millet as well as various food stocks to be used
during the drought period.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from food, we have given the communities tractors which
when used for cultivation will enhance moisture retention in the
soil," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Mail reported today that Christian Care, another
non-governmental organization, has set aside 40 million Zimbabwe
Dollars (three million U.S. Dollars) this year as a drought
contingency fund, an amount which is slightly higher than that of
1992.
</P>
<P>
"Our organization is already networking with other NGOs, our
ecumenical partners, the government and our target communities in
preparing ourselves to assist and avoid the situation of the 1992
drought," acting national director of Christian Care Frank
Mandlokuwa said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Department of Water and Development in
collaboration with the Institute of Water and Sanitation
Development, under the Ministry for Rural Resources and Water
Development will embark on a project that seeks to investigate
appropriate methods for achieving effective water quality
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is being funded by the Swedish embassy at a
cost of 2.8 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (200 million U.S. Dollars),
is to contribute to the establishment of sustainable water
quality management system in Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Resists External Pressure for Kaunda's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
resisted external pressure for the immediate release of former
president and opposition leader Kenneth Kaunda, saying that the
courts will determine his guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Sunday Times of Zambia, in an apparent
response to the calls for Kaunda's release from Washington and
South Africa, Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa stressed here
Saturday that Zambia is a sovereign state and will adhere to the
rule of law and human rights in determining the cases of those
implicated in the October 28 abortive coup.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the minister as saying that the Zambian
government is committed to the rule of law and will not break its
laws to suit an individual.
</P>
<P>
The government could not use the laws differently just because
someone is former president and has power and friends in high
places, said the minister, adding that "he should not be above
the law."
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of people who are detained and who we
believe were involved in the foiled October 28 coup and it would
not make much sense to release Kaunda leaving out the other
suspects," Machungwa noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was surprised that "America where the rule of
law obtains is saying we should not follow the law."
</P>
<P>
"Government will not follow the whims and fancies by people
who are friends of Kaunda. If those detained are innocent the
court will decide," the home affairs minister said.
</P>
<P>
Following the arrest and detention of Kaunda on the early
morning of Christmas Day, the U.S. and South Africa pressed the
Zambia government to release the 73 year-old veteran statesman,
said the government-owned newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A White House spokesman condemned the arrest and detention of
Kaunda and called for his quick release. He said in an undated
statement that "we call on the government of Zambia to release
him in the spirit of reconciliation and peace."
</P>
<P>
And South African President Nelson Mandela also called on the
Zambian government "to either bring Dr. Kaunda to trial
immediately or to release him from detention forthwith,"
according to a statement released Thursday by Mandela's office.
</P>
<P>
A number of African leaders besides Mandela have also
expressed their concerns over the arrest of Kaunda, who is
alleged to have connections with the failed October 28 coup
designed to topple the incumbent government.

LUSAKA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth Secretary General
Emeka Anyaoku has said the Commonwealth is concerned over former
Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda's arrest and hopes the Zambian
government will handle the case with the internationally accepted

</P>
<P>
Zambia's Sunday Mail today quoted the British Broadcasting

Mozambique, Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania and Ketumile Masire of
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper also reported that the Unites States has
said that it supports the inter-party dialogues to be held at the
end of this month but feared that the talks might not succeed if
Kaunda remains in detention.

The White House called on the government to release Kaunda for
the sake of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Micheal Sata, co-chairman of the inter-party talks and
government minister without portfolio announced Friday that the
proposed inter-party dialogue will be held in Livingstone,
southern Zambia on December 30 and 31 instead of planned January
10 next year.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement one day after Kaunda was arrested by
police.
</P>
<P>
Several parties have announced their withdrawal of the
inter-party dialogues including Kaunda's United National
Independence Party (UNIP).

Addressing the seminar of provincial governors general
Saturday, Khatami said that in a law-oriented and law-abiding
society such a practice would not only instill dignity but also
protect and preserve the rights of the individuals in the nation.
</P>
<P>
No freedom is possible unless it is within the norms of
law and that any practice of freedom outside the limits and
framework of law either breeds a state of anarchy or foments
dictatorship in a society, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, many Iranian top officials including Supreme
Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, President Khatami, Interior
Minister Abdollah Nouri openly called for rule of law in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Iranian leaders underlined the
importance of respect to laws because they felt that the Islamic
regime was threatened by unlawful actions inside the country,
particularly the factional violent conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that violent fightings occurred recently
among political factions due to their differences and several
cinemas in Isfahan and Amol were stormed by radicals in a protest
to the screening of the controversial film the Snowmen which was
believed to be against the Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leaders warned that such illegal actions taken by
certain factions under the name of Hezbollah would damage the
regime's image both in the country and in the world.
</P>
<P>
Khatami urged the governors general to be alert to the
potential dangers from outside the country as well as within the
nation, saying that the duty of the government is to guarantee the
security of the nation and that the provincial governors are
empowered to act within their jurisdiction against any alien force
and their domestic lackeys who try to cause harm to Iran.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Economists Welcome New Taxation System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The introduction of
value-added tax (VAT) in Zimbabwe has been welcomed by economists
who say this will widen the tax incidence and shed off the burden
of taxation as the government will have a wide revenue base.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sunday Mail today, a survey by the local
paper last week indicates that the VAT system is quite popular
with industrialists and economists but there was a convergence of
views that there should be an effective tax paper education first
before the system is introduced.
</P>
<P>
Economist Howard Sithole said the VAT was a more efficient tax
than the present general sales tax as it would be more difficult
to evade.
</P>
<P>
The system was also self-enforcing, said Sithole, adding that
it required proof of documentation on the tax paid by suppliers.
Tax officers would therefore not engage much time in chasing
after defaulters.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the general sales tax, a single-stage tax paid by the
consumer right at the end of the trading chain, the VAT is a tax
levied on value added at each stage of production rather than
only on the final selling price, the report explained.
</P>
<P>
Chief economist of the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe Danny Dube
said the present general sales tax had some loopholes as it
tended to exclude certain traders from the tax net.
</P>
<P>
"The present tax incidence is narrow. It needs to be widened
to ensure that more people pay tax and the tax burden on
individuals is lightened," he said.
</P>
<P>
The value-added principle is used in gross national product
accounting, to avoid double counting. Basically, the value added
tax is a sales tax of the multiple-stage type, but instead of
being levied on each turnover as the product progresses in stages
from the raw material form to purchase by the consumer of the
finished product, it is imposed on the increments of value-added
at each stage.

<HEADLINE> China's Central, Western Parts Opening Wider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The central and western parts of
China, a region which once lagged behind the coastal east in reforms
and opening up, are now making a new effort to narrow the gap.
</P>
<P>
The region accounts for more than 80 percent of the country's land
mass and 64 percent of its population, playing a decisive role in
China's economic prosperity as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Chances have come in recent years for the region to step up
reforms and open wider to the outside world, as the central
government began to shift its economic development priority
gradually to the central and western parts.
</P>
<P>
So, the state has opened another nine cities along the Yangtze
River, 13 border cities and all the capital cities in the region.
</P>
<P>
Investment environment and local infrastructure of the area
have been greatly improved by the development of the Yangtze River
watershed, construction of the Three Gorges project, operation of
the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, the second Eurasia Continental
Bridge, and the Nanning-Kunming Railway.
</P>
<P>
Ensuing funding from ministries and commissions for various
other major projects in the region is pushing forward the opening
up drive in the region.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 150 countries and regions have opened
businesses in the area, involved in infrastructure and basic
industries such as energy, communications, and agriculture, as
well as finance, insurance, real estate and retails.
</P>
<P>
To bring more foreign investment into the region, departments
concerned plan to provide preferential policies for equipment
imports to those overseas-funded projects which meet certain
conditions, according to Zhao Guanghua, deputy head of the Office
of Special Economic Zones under the State Council.

JOHANNESBURG, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen arrived here this morning for a
five-day official visit to South Africa, during which a joint
communique will be signed to establish diplomatic relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian was greeted at the airport by Wang Xuexian, Director of
the Chinese Center for South African Studies, and officials from
the South African Foreign Affairs Department.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued at the airport, Qian said: "
Although far apart from each other, the Chinese and South African
peoples enjoy a long history of exchanges."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people forged a profound friendship of
comrades-in-arms with the South African people during their
protracted and arduous struggle for racial equality," he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian stated that the Chinese people heartily rejoice at the
birth of a new South Africa, and the peoples of the two countries
will continue to support each other in their efforts to build up
their nations and develop economies.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to see that through the efforts of both sides,
the relations between our two countries are about to be
normalized," he noted.
</P>
<P>
This will open up new and broad vista for the development of
bilateral cooperation in various fields and the furtherance, on a
new basis, of the traditional friendship between the two peoples,
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister will fly to Cape Town this
morning where he will meet South African President Nelson Mandela
and Parliament Speaker Frene Ginwala.
</P>
<P>
Qian, the highest-ranking Chinese official ever to visit South
Africa, will also have talks with his South African counterpart
Alfred Nzo and sign an official joint communique over the
normalization of relations between the two countries on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela announced in November last year that his government
would sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan and establish
comprehensive diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of
China before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Qian is scheduled to attend on January 1 the opening ceremony
of the Chinese Embassy in Pretoria, the administrative capital of
South Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Results from a presidential election
opinion poll indicate that incumbent Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi could win a landslide victory in December 29
general elections, Sunday Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The poll conducted by the Public Universities Research Team
(PURT) shows President Moi leading with 49.2 percent of the votes
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The poll results released last night predicted that Moi,
the presidential candidate of the ruling Kenya African National Union
(KANU) is poised to get more than 25 percent of votes in seven of
the country's eight provinces.
</P>
<P>
Under Kenya's law, the winning presidential candidate must
collect at least 25 percent of the votes in at least five of

PURT ranks Mwai Kibaki of Democratic Party second to Moi with
16.2 percent, Ford-Kenya's Wamalwa Kijana third with 12.7
percent, Raila Odinga of National Development Party (NDP) fourth
10.1 percent, and Charity Ngilu of Social Democratic Party fifth

nationalistic after tomorrow's elections with parliamentary seats
garnered in all eight provinces including Central Province where
it was locked out in the general elections in 1992.
</P>
<P>
PURT said that its results were arrived at after it conducted
opinion poll in all the 210 constituencies in the east African
country between December 12 and 23.

DAR ES SALAAM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A six-year-old boy was
killed when his house wall collapsed while he was asleep on the
Christmas day, bringing the death toll of floods in the Tabora
Region in west Tanzania to 20.
</P>
<P>
Tabora Regional Commissioner, Stephen Mashishanga, told the
Daily News that the boy, who was buried by the debris, was
identified as Mateo Ndomo, a resident of the Nduguru division.
</P>
<P>
Mashishanga said the rains have also displaced 13,000 people
in the region after their houses were destroyed by floods that
have swept the whole country since the start of this month.
</P>
<P>
Some of the victims were being sheltered in government offices
while others were staying with relatives or friends, the press
said today.
</P>
<P>
The regional commissioner said heavy rains are still pouring
down in the region and the damages may be bigger if they
persisted.
</P>
<P>
So far, no outbreak of water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea
and cholera had been reported and regional authorities were
taking preventive measures, Mashishanga said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Mara Region in the north, residents have
contributed 6 million Shillings (about 9,000 U.S. Dollars) and
materials to reconstruct bridges and roads damaged by the floods.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Public Hospitals Resume General Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel's public hospitals
resumed the general strike today to protest against the planned
changes in the National Health Insurance system, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of doctors, nurses and administrative workers of the
public hospitals walked out at 8 O'clock this morning, and only
emergency services and vital departments are still functioning
normally.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the strike came after the breakdown in
negotiations Saturday night between the Israel Medical Association
and the Treasury, which brought a halt to a one-day strike in all
the public hospitals Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed changes in the health system, as part of the
Treasury-sponsored arrangements bill for the state budget of 1998
would allow each health fund to set its own basket of services,
thus increasing "competition", and demand that patients pay extra
charges of various treatments and medications.
</P>
<P>
The doctors are demanding that the proposals be removed
from the arrangements bill and be dealt with separately from
the state budget.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak Peterburg, the director-general of the country's public
hospitals, said that the changes will bring about the
establishment of two separate health systems -- one for the
well-off and another for lower socioeconomic groups.
</P>
<P>
He noted that under the new law the average family will have
to pay over 1,000 shekels (about 280 U.S. dollars) extra annually
for visits to doctors, hospital emergency rooms, outpatient
clinics and other services.

NANNING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Preparations has begun for
construction of a new water control project on the Xijiang River
near Baise, a city of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will involve a total investment of 7.78
billion yuan, is a major project for harnessing the Xijiang River
system in the Pearl River Valley in an all-round way.
</P>
<P>
It will be situated 22 km upstream of Baise and will have a
reservoir capable of storing 5.6 billion cu m of water. The
project will mainly be used for flood control, as well as for
power generation, navigation and irrigation.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the project will greatly improve the flood
combating capacity of the Youjiang River downstream and of Nanning
City, the regional capital, extending protection to 1.87 million
residents and 73,300 hectares of farmland. It will be able to
generate 1.69 billion kwh of electricity a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lhasa, December 28 (Xinhua) -- China's open policy and economic
reforms have promoted the development of publication services in
the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The region currently has 60 newspapers and periodicals, half of
them being Tibetan-language publications.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has a long history and is rich in culture. But before
the peaceful liberation of Tibet in the early 1950s, there were
few publications for the ordinary Tibetans except some classical
Buddhist books circulated in some major Temples.
</P>
<P>
On April 22, 1956, the "Tibet Daily" was published in both Tibetan
and Chinese languages in Lhasa City, capital of the region. Now
there are about 30 newspapers with nine Tibetan-language ones
covering political, economic, scientific and technological,
educational and cultural, and ethnic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tibet People's Publishing House has published
more than 2,000 kinds of books in the past 26 years and 70
percent of the books were printed in Tibetan-language.
</P>
<P>
The publishing house also published some books to spread the
knowledge of science and technology among Tibetans such as
"Application of Fertilizers", "On Prevention of Infectious Disease
of Cattles" and "Safety Measures for Electricity Applications".
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the publishing house has held Tibetan book
expositions in Nepal and India, as well as in Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, Tibet has set up a video publishing company
to publish audio and video tapes in the Tibetan language,
including "Singer Cedain Zhoima's Collection", "Hometown --
Changdu", "The 17th Garmaba Living Buddha" and "Tibetan Customs
MTV" as well as "Pilgrimage to the West".

<HEADLINE> China Scores Progress in Space Seed Breeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Yuan Longping, Chinese
scientist known as the "father of hybrid rice in China", has
recently turned to the research in space-treated seed breeding.
</P>
<P>
Yuan found in the second generation of space-treated seeds that
there is a kind of mutation which is 100 times over that in the
seeds treated under conventional radiation.
</P>
<P>
Yuan cultivated hybrid rice in 1973 and is trying to make a new
breakthrough in the breeding.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, Chinese scientists have selected more than 300
sorts of seeds from about 50 kinds of crops and micro-organism to
send up to the space. Practice has proved that their efforts are
rewarding.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts said that they are expecting to increase crop
output through the breeding of space-treated seeds. As one of the
three countries in the world that can retrieve satellites, China
enjoys the advantage of breeding seeds in space.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, China has sent a batch of rice seeds to the space and
following several years' efforts, a fine species of rice with
shorter stalks and longer kernel, disease-resistant and good
tillering capability was cultivated.
</P>
<P>
Now in Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province,
"space-treated pepper" was planted on more than 300 hectares.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, China has sent eight batches of crop
seeds into space. The space treatment operation has been extended
to insects and traditional Chinese herbs.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 1996 Chinese scientists conducted space
seed breeding for the herb scutellaria baicalensis, the root of
large-flowered skullcap.
</P>
<P>
They acquired the second-generation seeds of the herbs in
Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Pharmacies and
found some favorable mutations.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Chinese herbs are natural pharmacies under the
guideline of the traditional Chinese medical theory. Chinese
researchers said that space-treated seed breading will check the
tendency of decreasing number and quantity of the herbs and
enhance the pharmaceutical efficiency of the herbs.

</P>
<P>
Although information on the holiday accidents was still coming
in, the spokesman said the Christmas holiday had been bloody
though the number of accidents reported by yesterday were far
below those reported during the same period last year.

<P>
HARBIN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- This capital city of northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province is taking measures to promote trade
and economic relations with the Far East region of Russia, in a bid
to become a regional metropolis in northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to increase bilateral trade volume to two
billion US dollars by the year 2010, focusing on the Russian
cities of Yekaterinburg, Nakhodka, Vladivostok, and Chabarovsk, a
city government official said.
</P>
<P>
It has also begun to promote intergovernmental exchanges, and
agreed to set up a Sino-Russian Economic Coordinating Council, as
well as to improve the practice of tax collection and international
payments.
</P>
<P>
Harbin has established trade representative offices in the four
Russian cities. The offices have organized Chinese manufacturers
to hold exhibitions of high-quality Chinese goods.
</P>
<P>
The city opened Chinese name-brand products retail/wholesale
centers and bonded warehouses in Chabarovsky and Yekaterinburg,
respectively. The Xuanyuan Group opened a China commodity street
in Nakhodka, and the Sanxing Trade Company built a China furniture
center.
</P>
<P>
Harbin has quite a number of professionals specialized in
trade business with Russia, and convenient transportation by
water, air, train and highway. So it has every reason to expand
trade and economic cooperation with Russia, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: South Africa After Mandela (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Nelson Mandela, top
leader of South Africa's African National Congress (ANC), has
stepped down of his own accord as the ANC president at the just
concluded 50th ANC national conference in Mafikeng, North West
Province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, while Thabo Mbeki was elected unanimously at the
five-day meeting by ANC delegates as the party's new chief,
Mandela, the South African president who led the movement to bury
apartheid and has been leading his people to build a new South
Africa, has given Mbeki, his deputy, a full stage by announcing
that he would not participate in the 1999 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle of the ANC's leadership and the making of
comprehensive strategic decisions have drawn great attention not
only from people of all walks of life in South Africa but also
the world.
</P>
<P>
Will the latest ANC strategies and programs continue to work
without the 79-year-old Mandela? Mbeki, his successor, has given
the country and the world a convincing answer.
</P>
<P>
In his closing speech at the party's national conference,
Mbeki reaffirmed that the new leadership will stick to the
existing policy of national reconciliation, a course of action
taken by the ANC-led government ever since 1994 to maintain
social stability by tilting toward black people while taking into
account the interests of the whites.
</P>
<P>
It is generally acknowledged that after the abolition of
apartheid in 1994, the ruling ANC has been playing a key role in
national reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
In the past three and a half years, the party with a black
majority has spared no effort in restoring democracy and seeking
national reconciliation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to ANC's efforts, the central and local governments are
functioning normally with national unity maintained and the
national economy developing.
</P>
<P>
The ANC achievements owe a lot to its moderate policy based on
national reconciliation. Mandela, who is co-winner of the 1993
Nobel Peace Prize and enjoys high prestige at home and abroad,
has made tremendous contributions in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Three years after the abolition of the half-century-old
apartheid, South Africa has become a peaceful land where the
black and the white are living and working in harmony.
</P>
<P>
However, it is also true that today's South Africa is also
known for its high rates of crime and violence.
</P>
<P>
As the country's social transformation unfolds, the white
people living in clover began to feel uneasy as the democratic
reform is encroaching on their vested interest.
</P>
<P>
Pounded by the transformation, white extremists began
demanding to set up a so-called "white homeland" in hope to
retain their privilege as the white race.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the white, the disadvantaged black people, who
are eager to improve their living standards within a short period
of time, often complained about little change in their living and
working condition. Some of them have become so disappointed and
impatient that they even resort to armed robbery for quick
wealth.
</P>
<P>
The disappointment and resentment displayed by different races
have brought great pressure onto the ANC and the government.
However, it is unrealistic to weed out overnight the vestiges of
prolonged colonial rule and apartheid.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problems, Mbeki noted that instead of giving up
its national reconciliation policy in face of the Opposition, the
ANC will continue with the social transformation. Only when the
black and the white people are treated equally can social
stability be achieved, Mbeki stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the ANC would establish a mechanism which
will give all races and parties easy access to constructive
suggestions and criticism, thus paving the way to better
understanding and cooperation between the government and the
Opposition.
</P>
<P>
A new social system always encounters new problems and
conflicts. In the past three years, a large number of black
people who were short of professional training had been employed
by government organizations. Corruption, low efficiency and
bureaucracy, along with worsening social security, have posed
grave threats to the new born democracy.
</P>
<P>
The ANC-led government is giving priority to the fight against
increasing corruption and crimes, said Mbeki, adding that it was
not fair to attribute all the problems left by the apartheid
period to the current administration.
</P>
<P>
To settle these issues, the ANC head noted, it takes not only
time but also support and cooperation from all people in the
African country.
</P>
<P>
Only when more jobs are created, national economy developed
and the life of the black people remarkably improved, can the
social problems be solved fundamentally, said the upcoming leader
of the country. He pledged that the government is doing its best
to achieve this goal.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asian Currency Crisis May Hit Sri Lanka: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Southeast Asian currency
crisis which has caused economic havoc in a number of countries is
bound to have an impact on the economic growth in Sri Lanka, an
official of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Resident Representative of IMF in Colombo Anton Op de Beke said
that companies from Southeast Asian countries may scale down their
investments in Sri Lanka due to their financial problems. Tourism
from those countries to Sri Lanka could also be affected.
</P>
<P>
But he added it's too early to say how big the impact would be.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the Sri Lankan Rupee is being depreciated
constantly, thus helping the Sri Lanka Central Bank offset the
differences in inflation rates between Sri Lanka and its trading
partners and keep the currency competitive.
</P>
<P>
Since the crisis began to hit Southeast Asia in July,
currencies in Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia and
Malaysia have depreciated between 10 to 35 percent, leading to
large-scale bank closures and layoff of employees.
</P>
<P>
The economic pains also caused political instability in some
countries.

<P>
The South African economy grew at about three percent in both
1995 and 1996. It is estimated that the growth rate this year is
about two percent, far below the six percent blueprinted in the
government's growth, employment and redistribution (GEAR)
macro-economic strategy adopted last year.
</P>
<P>
At present, the economy faces many difficulties, among which
are fluctuating exchange rates, bad behavior of major sectors
like manufacturing and mining, overflowing money supply and slow
input of domestic and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Bleak as the economic picture is, it is already a big
achievement to maintain positive growth since the country is
undergoing profound political, economic and social
transformation.
</P>
<P>
At the party's national conference, resolutions were adopted
to cut down budget and reduce public spending, streamline
government structure and continue to implement the Reconstruction
and Development Program initiated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The conference also resolved that the private sector and
small- and medium-sized enterprises be engaged in promoting
investment, development and the settlement of labor-management
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, with its rich natural resources, sound
infrastructure and advanced management, is already the number one
economy in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the following years, the economy is expected to continue
its growth so that the country could maintain its position as
leader of the entire continent in trade and investment
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
To win the 1999 general election, the ANC adopted a strategy
of enhancing party unity, seeking cooperation from other
black-based political parties and maintaining high profile.
</P>
<P>
Before the conference, Mandela struck a conciliatory note with
the largest black opposition, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP),
calling for a merger of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The two parties were long-time rivals due to policy
differences, especially the one over the proposed autonomy of
Kwazulu-Natal Province where the IFP is based. The defusing of
tensions between them has led to significant reduction in
politically motivated violence in the Natal region.
</P>
<P>
Whether the initiative is finally realized or not, the shift
from conflict to cooperation between the two parties will be
certainly conducive to political stability in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela voluntarily quit the post of party president at
Mafikeng conference and declined nomination for the party's
National Executive Committee, its top decision-making body
between national conferences.
</P>
<P>
According to him, he would act as an ordinary member of the
ANC and would retire from active politics in 1999.
</P>
<P>
As Mbeki is already the de facto head of state, Mandela said,
he is fully confident that the ANC without him would win the 1999
election and Mbeki will become the new state president and lead
South Africa into the 21st century.

<P>
Since 1992, when the hunger eradication and poverty alleviation
program was launched, living conditions of some 1.21 million poor
families have improved, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Eleven provinces and cities have reduced the percentage of poor
families to below 10 percent. Among them, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh city
and Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province are in the lead with less than 5
percent of poor families.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that at present, there are still 2.6
million poor families in Vietnam, most of which on the northern
midlands and highlands and the central coast. About 90 percent of
the poor families are in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the percentage of poor families in
the cities and provinces has been slashed by 1.75 percent and that
in the countryside by 4.1 percent, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Over 9,000 thalassemic
children are born every year in India and there are 24 million
Indians who are carriers of the B-Thalassemia gene, the local
newspaper The Hindustan Times said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that at least 5,000-10,000 thalassemic children
are on irregular blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
The thalassemic children had to receive regular blood
transfusions every year. Due to the disorder, the body could not
make enough haemoglobin. While the child is well at birth, he
becomes anaemic within 3-18 months.
</P>
<P>
With every unit of blood transfused, 200-250 mg of iron also
goes into the body. It gets deposited in various organs leading to
darkened skin, discoloration of gums and teeth, liver fibrosis,
insulin dependent diabetes and even cardiac failure when iron gets
deposited on the heart muscles.

<HEADLINE> 35 Hour Work Week on Italian Government Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The government will open talks on
the prospect of bringing in a 35 hour work week in January,
Italian Labor Minister Tiziano Tren reported today as the
employers association Confindustria said the move to the shortened
week would carry a price tag of 31.470 trillion lire (18 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Tren said discussions with the trade union confederations and
employers' representatives are listed among the government's
"things to do" next month for supporting employment.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that any law on the reduced work week "must not be
parachuted in" but be drafted on the basis of dealings with labor
and employers. "There is a lot to be decided, the timetable, the
sectors, the conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The French project is a flexible type and could provide us
with some ideas," Treu added.
</P>
<P>
On the problem of joblessness, still running at more than 12
percent in Italy, the minister said the government intends to get
busy in January and February, beginning with an employment
conference to be convened.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government will follow through on the outcome
of the special European summit on employment in Luxemburg which
set guidelines for such interventions as bringing in the 35 hour
work week.
</P>
<P>
On this point, Confindustria said the impact would cost the
private sector 27.211 trillion lire (15.64 billion dollars).
Overall costs would rise 10 percent in industry, 7.2 percent in
the sector of salable services and 2.7 percent in the public
administration sector. enditem

<HEADLINE> Crashed Silk Air Plane's Black Box Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A frogman unit of the
Indonesian Navy has found the black box of the Silk Air plane that
crashed on December 19 in South Sumatra, Indonesia, and the box
will be sent to the United States on Sunday, an investigation
official said.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Indonesian investigation team from the
Transportation Ministry Prof. Oetarjo Diran said Saturday in
Palembang, South Sumatra that the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) would
be sent to the National Transport Safety Board in Washington.
</P>
<P>
By sending the FDR very soon, the cause of the plane crash will
be found out as soon as possible, local press on Sunday quoted
Oetarjo as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Silk Air Boeing 737-300 serving Jakarta-Singapore route
crashed at the Musi River in Makarti Village of Sungsang
subdistrict in the Musi Banyuasin regency, Palembang.
</P>
<P>
All 104 people on board were believed dead.
</P>
<P>
Transportation Minister Haryanto Dhanutirto, who observed the
location of the plane crash, said Saturday in Palembang that the
black box, which was found at around 3:15 p.m. local time, should
consist of an FDR and a Cockpit Voice Recording (CVR). But the CVR
had still been unfound.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the FDR was found on the bottom of the Musi
River, at the back side of the plane. However, he said, if the CVR
could not be discovered immediately, the investigation process
will be hampered.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, one of the recording is enough to carry out the
investigation, but sometimes we need two of them to make sure
about the result," Oetarjo said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Considering More Spending Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai said Saturday it was his biggest concern that the
government might not be able to collect enough revenue to meet
expenditure in fiscal 1998, according to the Bangkok Post Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chuan admitted that having a balanced budget of 800 billion
baht (17.8 billion US dollars) was virtually impossible, let alone
having a surplus of one percent of gross domestic product (GDP),
as required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for issuing
more fund to Thailand from the IMF-arranged 17.2 billion dollar
bailout package.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that the government may have to ask the
IMF to ease its bailout package conditions, particularly the
requirement of the one percent of GDP surplus in the budget.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of slashes had been made to the 1998 budget to
reduce it to 800 billion baht from over 1,000 billion baht.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said, "I would like to tell the people straight that
despite best efforts to increase revenue and to cut spending, if
there is still a revenue shortfall, it might be necessary to have
a tax increase. But the people will be told in advance and we will
try to cause minimum impact to the poor."
</P>
<P>
He said there would not be another budget cut, but
belt-tightening steps would be taken to bring spending down,
adding that the government would do its best to promote exports
and tourism to bring in much-needed foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart said on Saturday that
position allowances for senior officials in state enterprises
under the ministry are to be cut, following a 20 percent salary
cut for cabinet and parliament members for a one-year period.
</P>
<P>
The military has also announced plans to scrap its weaponry
purchases in fiscal 1998, which ends in September.

<HEADLINE> Scientific Farming Popular In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural techniques have
contributed some 40 percent to China's grain production increases
over the past few years, and an increasing number of farmers now
turn to scientific farming for higher returns.
</P>
<P>
Nong'an County in northeast China's Jilin Province is cited as
a typical example. It has been the country's leading
grain-producing county in the past three years, with an annual
production of two million tons, or one-240th of the national
total. China has more than 2,000 counties and county-level
cities. It harvested over 480 million tons of grain last year.
</P>
<P>
The Nong'an County Association for Science and Technology often
provides technical services for farmers. Li Yuhua, chairman of the
association, has been known as the "king of insects",or expert on
controlling insects.
</P>
<P>
A science and technology development center was set up
accordingly to offer solutions to any questions raised by farmers.
</P>
<P>
The county has expanded an agricultural technique spreading
network to every rural household, with part-time or full-time
senior researchers and professors working for it. And more than
1,000 farmers have been promoted to the status of agricultural
technicians.
</P>
<P>
Farmers also set up science and technology associations of
their own. Now, there are 112 such associations with nearly
15,000 members.
</P>
<P>
And officials at all levels are held accountable for expanding
the use of useful farming techniques.

Ships from Europe or Asia are more likely to be loaded with
dangerous materials. In August this year, a Japanese ship called
Pacific Pintail plied the canal carring a cargo of nuclear
materials.
</P>
<P>
This enraged the environmentalist groups, among them
Greenpeace, which warned that if a person got near a container
opened by accident, "he or she would die in just a few minutes."
</P>
<P>
However, Canal Commission officials said that the
transportation of such kinds of cargoes are in accordance with the
treaties established by the International Maritime Organization,
and the U.S. Coast Guard Service.
</P>
<P>
As it is stipulated in the treaties concerning the permanent
neutrality and operation of the canal, the Panama Canal must be
open to the transit of all the ships, as long as they pay the toll
fee and do not commit hostile actions against the waterway.
</P>
<P>
The Panama Canal is 80 kilometers (50 miles) long and can allow
more than 13,000 ships of diverse types to transit between the
Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans each year. enditem

NANNING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Litang-Qinzhou Railway is
scheduled to open in December of 1998 for the 40th anniversary of
the founding of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, according to
local sources.
</P>
<P>
The railway, a key project included in the country's Ninth
Five-Year Plan, will start from the intersection of the
Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, China's north-south artery, and
Xiangtan-Guizhou Railway running through the mid-south region, and
stretch to Qinzhou, a seaport city on Beibu Bay.
</P>
<P>
The construction will involve excavating 387 tunnels and
building 315 bridges.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the railway, three southern sea outlets
in the autonomous region will play more prominent roles in marine
transportation for cargo from the two north-south railways. The
railway can save more than 200 kilometers compared with loading
cargo in Zhanjiang in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The three ports include Qinzhou, Fangcheng and Beihai, with the
latter two connected to the railway by Nanning-Kunming Railway, a
trunk line recently completed in the southwest region.
</P>
<P>
The railway will run through poverty-stricken mountainous areas in
the eastern part of the region where no railway traffic has gone
before. Local officials have placed high hopes on the railway to
help the region rise out of poverty.

<HEADLINE> One Fourth of World Population to Suffer from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A German population foundation
today predicted that at least a fourth of the world population are
expected to suffer from fresh water shortage by the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hannover-based German Foundation of World
Population, more than 430 million people, or about eight percent
of the world population, are currently living in countries which
are plagued by water shortage.
</P>
<P>
By mid next century, the figures are expected to rise to about
two billion or even 6.8 billion with the world population expected
to grow to between 7.7 billion and 11.2 billion, the German
foundation quoted a recent study conducted by the international
organization Population Action International (PAI) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The PAI study also cautioned that the increasing rivalry over
the scarce water resources in some regions, with the
Euphrates-Tigris Basin, the Nile Basin and the southern Africa in
particular, could lead to open conflicts among the countries
concerned.
</P>
<P>
While the Middle East and North Africa are hardest hit by water
shortage today, the sub-Saharian Africa would be the most
problematic region in the next 50 years with its population
expected to double its current level during the period, the study
predicted.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Outlines Medicare Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today outlined the nation's Medicare reforms that make cancer
screenings less expensive for 39 million older Americans by New
Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
Under the balanced budget agreement that Clinton negotiated
with Congress, the nation's 39 million Medicare beneficiaries
will be guaranteed regular tests for breast, cervical and
colon-rectal cancer.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that early detection of these cancers can boost
survival rates as high as 90 to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly every American family has been touched by the shadow of
cancer," Clinton said in his weekly radio address. "By detecting
cancer early on we offer our loved ones one of the greatest gifts
of all _ the gifts of life, health and many holidays to come."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the new program will offer annual breast X-rays
for all Medicare-eligible women age 40 and older.
</P>
<P>
The program will cover pay for pap smears and pelvic exams
every three years, or annually for women who are at high risk for
cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
Diagnosed early, the cancer can be treated with a 90-percent
survival rate, but the rate drops to 7 percent when the cancer is
missed until its advanced stage, said Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Strike Central Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Two tornadoes struck
central Florida today, injuring at least eight people and damaging
nearly 100 mobile homes, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
The injuries, all at Haines City, Florida, were limited cuts
and bruises. Some of the mobile homes were overturned by the
storm.
</P>
<P>
Osceola County commissioners have declared a state of emergency
for the county because of a tornado.
</P>
<P>
Power and road crews were called to repair downed power lines
and remove broken trees. Many oranges were blown off trees and
some went through windows, hitting people inside. Cars and boats
were picked up and moved into other yards.
</P>
<P>
The storms followed three days of rainfall, and Saturday's
heavy rain on saturated ground caused flooding in low-lying areas
around the Tampa Bay area.
