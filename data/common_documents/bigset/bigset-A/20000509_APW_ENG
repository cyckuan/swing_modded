<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits 534 Homer, Ties Foxx  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit his NL-leading 12th homer
of the season Monday night and moved into a tie with Jimmie Foxx
for ninth place on the career list with 534.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's solo homer off San Francisco starter Livan Hernandez
came in the sixth inning and went 430 feet into the right-center
bleachers. McGwire has homered in nine of his last 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first run of the game for the St. Louis Cardinals,
and broke a 26-inning scoreless streak by Giants pitchers -- San
Francisco's longest such streak since a 30-inning scoreless run on
July 5-9, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Mantle is eighth on the career homer list with 536.

   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Advisers close to failed Republican candidate John McCain
say he has decided to endorse former rival George W. Bush at their summit
tomorrow, despite misgivings about the Texan's agenda. The Arizona senator is
said to have determined after a series of events -- including a weekend

   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Accompanied by FBI agents, Philippine police
raided an apartment in Manila on Monday and arrested a bank employee who along
with his girlfriend is suspected of links to the ''ILOVEYOU'' virus that has
overwhelmed computer networks around the world. But relatives of the man, Reomel
Ramones, said they believe the real culprit may be a third person who lived in

   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- A fire set to clear underbrush at a national
monument that lost control forced the closure of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory Monday and sent at least 500 people from their homes. A separate fire
200 miles southeast near Ruidoso burned 4,500 acres and forced the evacuation of
at least 200 homes. High wind caused problems with both fires, and Gov. Gary
Johnson declared a state of emergency. ''we're going to stay as long as we

Philly Adopts All-Uniform Rule

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia adopted a policy tonight requiring all
students to wear uniforms in 256 public schools, the first big-city district to
do so. Most parents who spoke opposed uniforms for Philadelphia's 217,000
public-school students. The measure, which goes into effect immediately, does
not call for a single, Roman Catholic-school-style uniform; instead, schools
could decide individually how students should dress.

Nationwide strike ends in Norway

   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- A strike that threatened European automobile production
was called off Tuesday after Norway's largest union and employers agreed on a
new contract in all-night talks. The deal was reached in the sixth day of a
strike by 84,600 union members, which the union had threatened to turn into
Norway's second largest labor conflict by pushing the number of strikers to over
102,000 on Tuesday. The deal was reached just two hours before that deadline.
Even though the new offer also has to be put to a vote by union members,
strikers were returning to work immediately pending the outcome of that

<HEADLINE> 76ers' Snow's Season Maybe Over  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Philadelphia point guard Eric Snow
apparently won't be available to the 76ers for the rest of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Snow, who missed the final two games of the first-round series
against Charlotte with a fracture in his right ankle, was told
after Monday night's 103-97 loss to the Indiana Pacers that team
doctors believe it is unlikely he will play again this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''As of now, I'm finished. I didn't hear anything pop or give
way; I just couldn't push off or accelerate,'' said Snow, who
played only four minutes in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can go out there and try, but I won't be effective,'' said
Snow, who scored two points in 23 minutes Monday. ''It won't get
any better until I take time off. I've never had pain like this
from an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''The championship is what you work for and now I won't be able
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow said the pain is not his main concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pain is not what bothers me. I can live with the pain,''
he said. ''I can't push the ball up the court. I can't defend. I
can't pressure. I can't get over screens. I've played in two games
and had almost no rebounds and no steals. ... I just can't be
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers said an MRI would be performed on the ankle when the
team returns to Philadelphia and that it would be put in a cast.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did come back too soon. It was a mistake to come back now,
but I felt like I could help the team,'' Snow said. ''It's not fair
for me to be out there and not be effective when we have other guys
here on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers won both games Snow missed against the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've proven we can win without Eric,'' 76ers guard Allen
Iverson said. ''I don't want Eric to play if he's that hurt. I want
him in the foxhole with us, but if he's hurt that bad, he can't
take a chance with his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make the playoffs every year, and we need him every
year.''

<HEADLINE> Drug law reformers, others, seek Legislature's attention  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state's Rockefeller drug laws are
wasting money and people's lives, but most of all they are harming
the children of those convicted of them, two recently paroled
narcotics offenders said.
</P>
<P>
   The drug law reform demonstration the women spoke at Monday was
one of several events planned this week in Albany as groups try to
influence the state Legislature and Pataki to act on issues
outstanding in the lawmakers' 2000 session.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature finished adopting a budget last Friday for the
2000-01 state fiscal year. It is expected to be in session for six
or seven more weeks before adjourning, possibly for the rest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Bartlett and Jan Warren were both granted clemency in
December 1999 by Pataki, making them immediately eligible for what
proved to be successful parole hearings. Both women had served more
than half their sentences of at least 15 years to life under the
state's mandatory drug laws which date back to Nelson Rockefeller's
era as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels good to be free,'' Bartlett told about 200 people
gathered for a rally at the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Warren said the drug laws are primarily hurting the children of
the men and women who are behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't ask for us to be stupid, we did that all on our
own,'' Warren said. ''But they're paying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett added, ''We all know that we made a mistake. We're only
human. ... But did our mistake warrant the time they gave us?''
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers remembered the late Cardinal John O'Connor at
the rally, which was held at the same time as funeral services were
getting underway for O'Connor at St. Patrick's Cathedral in
Manhattan. The state's Roman Catholic bishops, headed by O'Connor,
came out in favor of reforming the Rockefeller drug statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Al Lewis, the 1998 Green Party candidate for governor who is
running for U.S. Senate this year, pointed to the Capitol and told
those attending the rally that they were ''just as responsible as
the fools who sit in that building'' for not insisting that the
drug laws be reworked.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, best known as ''Grandpa'' in ''The Munsters'' television
series of 1960s, said it became common after World War II to ask,
''What did the good Germans do?'' about the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are responsible, we, because somebody is going to say 30
years from now, 'What did the good people of New York state and the
United States do?'' he said of the drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   The top Republican in the state Legislature, Senate Majority
Leader Joseph Bruno, and the state's chief judge, Judith Kaye, have
also called for reform of the Rockefeller drug laws. Pataki, who
last year proposed changes that opponents said did not go far
enough, has not modified his plan this year.
</P>
<P>
   Upward of 10,000 public employees and retirees plan to rally at
the Capitol today to push for establishment of a permanent
cost-of-living adjustment to public retirees' pensions. Pataki
indicated last week he supports such increases tied to some gauge
of living expenses such as the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues which are certain to be considered by the
Legislature -- though not necessarily acted on -- between now and its
expected adjournment include:
</P>
<P>
   --Sex assault reform. The Senate, Assembly and governor have all
called for laws to be toughened, but have been unable to agree on a
single approach.
</P>
<P>
   --Juvenile justice reform. Pataki and the Senate have been
pushing harsher penalties for young criminals, but Assembly
Democrats have been wary of too-stringent punishments for some
youthful offenders whose lives can be redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   --Privacy issues. Protecting the privacy of New Yorkers,
especially against internet crooks and snoops, has become something
of a hot topic at the Capitol. But there has been no accord on
distilling various proposals into one bill.
</P>
<P>
   --Teacher violence. Teachers' unions are fighting to increase
penalties for violence against teachers.
</P>
<P>
   --HMO accountability. Doctors' and medical consumer groups want
to rein in what they say are health maintenance organizations with
too much power, especially in making medical decisions.
</P>
<P>
   --Cameras in court. Bruno and Pataki have said they want to pass
legislation, but long-standing opponents in the Assembly remain
opposed to opening courtrooms to television and still cameras.
</P>
<P>
   --Anti-smoking. Bills before the Legislature include those to
raise the legal age of purchase for tobacco from 18 to 19 or to 21
and to toughen the state's restrictions on smoking in public
places.
</P>
<P>
   --Gun safety. Pataki, the Senate and Assembly have all promised
to work toward passage of bills to require trigger locks and other
measures to keep dangerous guns out of the hands of young people.

<HEADLINE> ''Adopted'' nuns will pray for their sponsors  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- When Joyce Fink ''adopted'' Sister
Grace Marie Korn for a $500 donation, the 91-year-old nun promised
her a year's worth of prayer.
</P>
<P>
   It's a unique arrangement Sister Grace Marie's order hopes to
see more of as part of a fund-raising program that invites the
public to adopt sisters to pray for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not praying for pay,'' stressed Sister Grace Marie, a
member of the Williamsville Franciscan Sisters whose Adopt-A-Sister
program is just getting underway.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the sisters hope to develop lasting personal
relationships while inching toward their $3.7 million fund-raising
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just 'so I add one more person in my prayers,' but a
more personal type of being there for another individual,'' said
Sister Marcella Nacreiner, communications director for the
Buffalo-area order.
</P>
<P>
   Praying for others is nothing new to the nuns, who for
generations have honored requests for intentions and accepted
donations. The Adopt-A-Sister program links the practices and
provides an opportunity for new relationships between the sisters
and those they help.
</P>
<P>
   ''Throughout our history we have been women of prayer. We've had
people calling in or stopping in to say 'please pray for my
daughter who's having surgery, my son who's looking for
employment,' whatever,'' said Sister Bea Leising. ''This is kind of
a continuation of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Grace Marie, the first member of the order to be adopted,
prays for Fink during her daily 11 a.m. visits to the Chapel of
Adoration.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of my activities I guess maybe prohibit me from spending
that many hours in prayer so it's wonderful to have that,'' said
Fink, a retired public affairs director at Buffalo State College
who is on the board organizing the sisters' fund appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she said, her adopted sister and others like her have
spent hours a day for decades in prayer. Sister Grace Marie has
been a nun 72 years. ''We figure they have a system and it's
probably working so I hope it works for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship goes beyond prayer. ''There's a spiritual
bonding where Grace Marie and I can sit and talk and she can give
me a spiritual book to go read and things like that,'' Fink said,
''so there are other dimensions to it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Williamsville order came up with the idea during a
brainstorming session, the program is similar to one started
several years ago by the Salesian Sisters of North Haledon, N.J.,
who have raised more than $1 million toward a new retirement home.
A few other orders also have similar programs, the Williamsville
sisters said.
</P>
<P>
   The relationships can be as personal as the donors wish.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had someone call and say 'I really want somebody I can come
in and sit down and talk with because I'd like them to be praying
for my children and I want to share that with them,''' Leising
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those adopting a sister are sent a picture of her with her
address, phone number, birthday and a profile. Donors may choose a
sister or have one assigned. While any sister can be adopted, the
program is geared toward the older members of the order who have
more time to devote to prayer. There is no limit to the number of
times a sister can be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The program is part of a $3.7 million fund-raising effort that
the Sisters of St. Francis launched to help pay for the $12 million
St. Mary of the Angels Motherhouse they moved into six months ago.
The site houses the order's administrative offices, housing for
active sisters and assisted living and skilled nursing space for
elderly and infirm sisters.

<HEADLINE> State pension fund grows to $127 billion  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A volatile year on Wall Street did little
harm to the New York's government worker pension fund, which has
grown to a record $127 billion.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said Monday stock market
fluctuations had ''some impact'' on the state Common Retirement
Fund but added that with well-diversified investments, ''there
really is no cause for concern.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I continue to believe in the market in terms of its long-term
viability,'' said McCall, the sole administrator of the New York
State and Local Retirement Systems. ''The underlying principles of
our market are very good and overall the long-term prospect of the
market is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, McCall said he has decided to reduce the
percentage of the fund invested in domestic stocks from about 50
percent to 45 percent over two to three years. That would be done
by investing the interest income in other ventures such as real
estate and international investments.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he doesn't plan to sell the state's nearly 17
million shares of Microsoft Corp., which is facing the threat of a
breakup. McCall said while the software giant's future is
uncertain, its ''attractive products'' would ensure that it would
continue to perform well.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said the performance of the state pension fund has helped
state and local taxpayers save $1.2 billion since 1996 as bills to
government employers have decreased to zero for their share of the
pension costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because the pension fund has done so well, and it has provided
significant benefits for employers, it's time we do something for
retirees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller called for automatic cost-of-living adjustments
for retirees, a move that Gov. George Pataki indicated last week he
would support. Current and retired public employees have planned a
pro-COLA rally today in Albany, and McCall said he intends to join
them. Organizers said they expected as many as 10,000 people at the
event.
</P>
<P>
   McCall also said with high earnings from the state's
investments, a complete elimination of pension contributions from
all public employees is possible. Pension contributions by current
employees in Tier III and Tier IV of the Common Retirement Fund
made up about $600 million of the fund's $6.9 billion income last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Common Retirement Fund was about $115 billion last year and
has grown from $56 billion in 1993, McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund had a five-year average rate of return of 17.7 percent,
with a one-year rate of return of 17.8 percent for the state fiscal
year that ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   McCall pointed out that the rate of return for fixed income --
investment in bonds -- dropped to 1.3 percent. The five-year average
rate of return of fixed income was 8 percent. The comptroller said
the decline was due to the Federal Reserve raising interest rates
several times in the past year. When interest rates go up, the
value of bonds go down, he said. About 27 percent of the pension
fund is invested in bonds.
</P>
<P>
   That decline was offset by an increase in returns from
international equities, which makes up about 10.5 percent of the
fund.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800,000 current and former employees of state and
local governments around the state have money in the State and
Local Retirement System.

<HEADLINE> Fire Partially Closes Los Alamos  </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH BAKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- A fire set to clear underbrush at a
national monument that got out of control forced the closure of the
Los Alamos National Laboratory Monday and sent at least 500 people
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   A separate fire 200 miles southeast near Ruidoso burned 5,400
acres and forced the evacuation of at least 200 homes.
</P>
<P>
   High wind caused problems with both fires, and Gov. Gary Johnson
declared a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to stay as long as we can,'' said former Rep. Bill
Redmond, R-N.M., a Senate candidate whose home was among 1,000
placed on evacuation alert in Los Alamos. An additional 500 homes
on the west side of town were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which has scorched more than 3,000 acres, was about a
mile away from the nearest homes Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos fire spokesman Jim Paxon said cloudier, cooler
weather helped firefighters Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This cloud cover is a godsend. ... We are very confident
things are going in the right direction,'' said Paxon, a Forest
Service spokesman assigned to the multiagency fire team.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the fire was earlier downgraded from an estimated
5,000 acres Monday to 1,935 acres that were actually mapped with
aerial infrared radar, fire spokeswoman Rita Skinner said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was set Thursday by National Park Service to get rid of
excess underbrush and deadwood at the Bandelier National Monument,
home of ancient Indian ruins and 70 miles of hiking trails.
</P>
<P>
   Park Superintendent Roy Weaver took responsibility for the
blaze, saying he believed conditions had been just right for the
park's annual regimen of prescribed burning, designed to keep the
park's backcountry from becoming a ''tinder box.'' The Park Service
had planned to burn just 900 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ''There seemed to be the right balance of fuel, moisture,
temperature and wind,'' Weaver said at a news conference. But the
humidity didn't get as high as hoped and wind was higher than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear research lab's explosive materials are secured in
nonflammable concrete and metal buildings surrounded by earthen
berms about a half-mile from the fire, lab spokesman John Gustafson
said. The closest radioactive materials were about three miles from
the fire, spokesman Kevin Roark said.
</P>
<P>
   Only essential personnel reported for work Monday at the lab,
Department of Energy officials said. Public schools were closed and
Los Alamos County told most of its workers to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's human error to mess with Mother Nature when it's
hot and windy -- it's stupid,'' said Holly Harmston, owner of a Los
Alamos cafe shut down because of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say this fire season could rival the one in 1996, when
intense fires threatened communities in wooded areas.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Futures' Stock Trading Gets Support  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Leaders of the top U.S. futures exchanges
appealed to a Senate committee to ease restrictions they say act as
a ''ball and chain'' as they innovate to try to hold off a slew of
new electronic challengers.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress heeds their appeal, American investors may be able
to buy and sell a new financial product -- futures contracts on
individual stocks -- within months.
</P>
<P>
   The push to trade single-stock futures got a boost Monday with
endorsements by federal regulators at a Senate Banking Committee
hearing in Chicago's financial district.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. markets currently trade in stocks, stock options and
futures, including futures contracts on broad-based stock-index
options.
</P>
<P>
   Futures on individual stocks were banned in 1982, the result of
a dispute over which agency would regulate them -- the Securities
and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But the ban may be on the brink of being lifted. SEC chairman
Arthur Levitt told the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and
Urban Affairs that the two regulatory agencies have laid the
''cornerstone of an agreement'' providing for joint regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was cautiously optimistic before the hearing, and I'm even
more optimistic now,'' CFTC chairman William Rainer told reporters
after hearing encouraging words from committee chairman Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, and others.
</P>
<P>
   A future contract on a stock would obligate the holder to buy or
sell the security of a company, for example Apple Computer Inc., at
a specified future date and price, although it likely would most
often be settled in cash based on the stock price. That differs
from an option, which gives the buyer the right but not the
obligation to buy or sell at a certain time and price.
</P>
<P>
   If the two agencies can iron out their differences over margin
requirements and other issues, futures on single stocks and
narrow-based equity indexes could be traded on both futures and
securities exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Outside experts question whether individual stock futures would
generate huge business, citing examples from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Single-stock futures contracts are currently traded in eight
countries -- Australia, Finland, Hong Kong (China), Hungary, Mexico,
Portugal, South Africa and Sweden. Investors on those exchanges
bought or sold about 2 million individual-stock contracts last year
involving 200 companies -- no U.S. companies among them.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, about 1.3 billion contracts were traded worldwide
in the derivatives industry last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chicago exchanges, which have benefited from heavy
trading in futures of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and Nasdaq indexes,
say investors should be given the chance. They said the ban
typifies the over-regulation that is hampering them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Traditional exchanges now face an onslaught of new exchanges,
electronic trading networks and over-the-counter markets competing
for the risk management business we founded in Chicago,'' Chicago
Board of Trade chairman David Brennan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''U.S. exchanges increasingly suffer from a severe fairness
handicap,'' he said, adding that traditional exchanges like his
''must compete while dragging a ball and chain of costly and
outmoded regulations that add costs for our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Gordon, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
concurred. ''Overly detailed regulation of futures exchanges
increases direct costs and time to market of innovative products,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
lost their longtime claim as the world's largest futures markets to
the all-electronic Eurex of Frankfurt, Germany, last year, when
U.S. exchange-traded futures volume declined by about 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clay Animation Studio Teaches Art  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER KIMURA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Brad Schiff walks around with plastic
boxes containing miniature lips that pucker, frown, shout and
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the lead animators for Portland's Will Vinton Studios,
Schiff makes Claymation puppets. Under his care, little lips and
eyeballs take on realistic facial expressions and bits of clay are
given fluid movement in the form of M&AMP;M ''spokescandies'' and the
dancing California Raisins.
</P>
<P>
   ''We make extra eyeballs because they do get lost,'' said Sean
Dickson, who works with Schiff in the studio's art lab.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson and Schiff's latest project is NFL commercials featuring
smack-talking sportscasters James Brown and Terry Bradshaw as
cartoonish characters. Six 15-second spots are airing this month.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, they animated the first season of Thurgood Stubbs and
his inner-city family in the Fox sitcom, ''The PJs.'' The show,
which featured Eddie Murphy as Stubbs' voice, will begin its second
season this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lot of work,'' said Schiff, who has worked at the
studio for 2{ years. ''But it's a lot of fun. It's hard and it's
frustrating, but I get to play for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty participants from around the country -- including art
directors, advertising executives, broadcast and production
directors -- converged on Will Vinton Studios recently for workshops
on the artistic, technical and marketing aspects of animation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Animation Camp, now in its seventh year, Schiff taught a
workshop on stop-motion animation -- the method that brought fame to
the studio in 1986 with the wildly popular ''California Raisins''
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The tools of the trade include clay bits, silicone molds and
wire puppet skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to do animation; I want to learn how the pros do it,''
said Michael Corbeille, a senior art director for a Chicago-based
ad agency who is working on ads for McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   At the camp's character development lab, David Altschul, Will
Vinton's president of advertising, stressed that the key to any
effective commercial is a storyline with a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all too easy to put sunglasses and feet on a character
and make them warmhearted,'' Altschul said. ''Something needs to be
imperfect.''
</P>
<P>
   The 60-plus spots the studio has made in the past five years for
Mars Inc.'s M&AMP;M Mars subsidiary typically play upon three
conflicts, Altschul said: short characters in a tall-person's
world, animated characters in a human's world, or the end-all
plight -- being edible in a hungry world.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The characters') own real personalities are in this,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While endearing themselves to viewers, the animated spots also
accomplish the obvious goal: moving the product. Altschul said the
M&AMP;M spots have boosted the chocolate candy's sales by $250 million
in the United States and overseas during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Will Vinton Studio was founded in 1975, it has evolved
with technology, combining digital work with their brand-name
Claymation style in spots for Kikkoman, Nissan, Sony Playstation,
Domino's Pizza and others.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little bit of an education process -- to think more
broadly,'' said Tom Turpin, CEO of the studio and a former
multimedia division chief for the Virgin Group. ''Technology is
changing, costs are coming down,'' he said. ''There's a lot of
things to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Animation Camp participants gained hands-on lessons creating
computer-generated images with a program that maps a character's
three-dimensional movement.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie animators also got their hands dirty, molding their
own chunks of clay against a white screen while a studio expert
took stop-motion sequences at intervals. The end result -- a
10-second film clip of moving clay.
</P>
<P>
   They also dabbled in animation with sand and title sequences,
tried a hand at posing the actual puppets from ''The PJs,'' and
learned Pixelation, a method of photographing an object and moving
it at intervals to give the appearance that it's moving by itself.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound more like play than work, but Claymation takes
patience.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a character's model and texture through a series of
mouse clicks and obscure commands could take up to two weeks,
computer wizard Shawn McInerney said. ''Animation is not the
fastest thing in the world,'' he said. ''It's like watching grass
grow.''

<HEADLINE> Food Makers Unveil Caloric Products  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Craving some fat? Sara Lee Corp. is betting
you'll like its new Calzone Creations microwavable sandwiches with
as much as 12 grams of artery-clogging saturated fat, 60 percent of
the recommended daily intake for an average person.
</P>
<P>
   If you get hungry before dinner, there's now a cheesecake snack
bar that Kraft Foods says will make the confection an ''everyday
indulgence.''
</P>
<P>
   With Americans worrying less about fat and calories these days,
food makers are rolling out a raft of fat-laden, calorie-packed new
products at the supermarket industry's annual trade show.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other new goodies: Oscar Meyer Lunchables sweet rolls
that the kids can carry to school for recess and single-serving
packs of dip from Dean Foods that people can take to the office to
make those carrots and other veggies go down easier. And there are
new versions of Nestle's Power Bar, a staple of long-distance
runners, that are essentially vitamin-fortified candy bars, with up
to eight times as much saturated fat as the original.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't watch my fat intake at all,'' said Glen Murphy of
Mississauga, Ontario, as he sampled one of the Calzone Creations, a
croissant-like pocket stuffed with meat, cheese and vegetables. ''I
like what I buy and I eat it and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry research indicates consumer concern about fat has been
falling in recent years, even as food makers have struggled to
market low-fat products.
</P>
<P>
   Among supermarket shoppers who say they are very concerned about
nutrition, just 46 percent of consumers say they are worried about
the fat content. That's down from 60 percent in 1996, according to
a poll sponsored by the Food Marketing Institute, the supermarket
industry trade group. Interest in sodium content and cholesterol
levels also is down.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have been ''deluged with conflicting, sometimes
misleading claims'' about nutrition and diet and they've reacted by
''tuning out,'' said Michael Sansolo, the FMI's senior vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the number of Americans who are considered obese has
soared from about one in eight in 1991 to one in five by last year,
according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is so much food out there ... and most of it is not the
healthiest,'' said Margo Wootan, a nutrition expert with the Center
for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group that has
criticized Kraft's new cheesecake bars as ''food porn.''
</P>
<P>
   But most people still care about good nutrition, she said.
''They just find it increasingly difficult to eat better,'' Wootan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of new food products bearing low-fat or low-calorie
claims more than doubled from 1993 to 1996 -- from 847 to 2,076 --
but then dropped by half two years later, according to New Product
News, a publication that tracks the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee tested various versions of its Calzone sandwiches with
chefs and found that the less fat the products had the less they
were liked. Companies also are finding, they say, that the same
consumers who will buy products like the Kraft's cheesecake bars
are often the same ones who are driving the boom in soy burgers and
other health foods.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people now are taking an open-minded approach to managing
their whole diet,'' Kraft spokeswoman Nancy Daigler said.
</P>
<P>
   Leah Brown, a food show worker from Chicago, sampled one of the
cheesecake bars at the Kraft exhibit and pronounced it ''very good
and I don't like cheesecake.''
</P>
<P>
   It's ''not the real New York cheese cake, but it's a fairly
decent copy,'' said Stuart Ladin, a supermarket equipment supplier
from Winnetka, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Foods, the nation's second-largest dairy processor, is
marketing its new Dips-For-One as a way to eat healthier. The
government's proposed new Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests
such dips as one way for consumers to increase their vegetable
intake.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since vegetables, such as carrots and celery now come
individually packaged for convenience, it was only logical for
Dean's to provide a portable dip snack,'' company spokesman Phil
Dolci said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks To Ban Roads in Forest  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration on Tuesday will
call for banning road construction in 43 million acres of roadless
federal forests and propose allowing local foresters to decide
whether to bar activities such as logging, mining and
off-road-vehicle use.
</P>
<P>
   The plan defers a decision on whether to prohibit roads in 8.7
million acres of the nation's largest forest, the Tongass in
Alaska, until 2004 when agency officials review a separate plan
governing that forest.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving out the Tongass ''just leaves a gaping hole in this
policy,'' said Matt Zencey, campaign manager of the Alaska
Rainforest Campaign. Other environmental groups also found the plan
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Industry groups also complained, saying the proposal -- as they
had expected -- limits their access to forests. ''It's another step
toward zero harvest,'' said Jim Geisinger, president of the
Northwest Forestry Association in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck was scheduled to announce the
plan at a news conference Tuesday in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 million acres of the 192 million acres of federal
forests are considered wild, or undeveloped. The rest of the
acreage, governed by the Forest Service, is host to a wide range of
activities, including logging, camping, skiing, mining and
off-road-vehicle use.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists complain that roads cause runoff, disrupt
plant and wildlife and make it easier for people to conduct harmful
activities such as logging, mining and off-road-vehicle riding.
</P>
<P>
   The plan sets broad criteria for what activities to allow in
forests but would have local officials make the final call. It also
would leave it up to local foresters to decide whether roads should
be banned in smaller forest parcels -- those 5,000 acres or less.
</P>
<P>
   The forest protection plan requires no congressional action,
relying on regulations to be issued by the Forest Service after a
detailed environmental review and public comments.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal could gain final approval at the end of the year,
just before President Clinton leaves office. But environmentalists
expect Republicans in Congress to try to delay the rulemaking until
after Clinton's term. Court challenges from industry groups against
the rule are likely.

<HEADLINE> Giants 6, Cardinals 4  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Giants' winning streak is
very much alive, even though their scoreless innings streak ended
with one Mark McGwire swing.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Estalella homered twice, including a three-run shot, and
Livan Hernandez pitched his second straight strong game as the
Giants defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 6-4 Monday night to win
their seventh straight.
</P>
<P>
   After losing seven of the first eight games at their new Pacific
Bell Park, the Giants have won seven straight at home.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' first run was a 430-foot homer by McGwire, his 12th
of the season and the 534th of his career --tying him with Jimmie
Foxx for ninth on the career list, two behind Mickey Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who has homered in nine of his last 14 games, homered
into the right-center bleachers in the sixth inning off Hernandez.
It was the 36th major league park in which McGwire has homered,
tying Fred McGriff for the career record.
</P>
<P>
   The homer broke a 26-inning scoreless streak by Giants pitchers,
the longest such streak for San Francisco since a run of 30
straight scoreless innings from July 5-9, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had not allowed a run since Mike Piazza's homer for
the New York Mets in the sixth inning on Thursday. San Francisco
shut out Colorado on Friday and Saturday, and was rained out
against the Rockies on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, pinch-hitter Larry Sutton hit another solo homer
off Hernandez. Fernando Vina and Edgar Renteria then singled to
knock out Hernandez, but Alan Embree relieved and struck out Ray
Lankford.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Drew hit a two-run homer off John Johnstone in the eighth
to pull the Cardinals within 5-4, but Johnstone worked out of the
inning and Robb Nen pitched the ninth for his fifth save in seven
chances, with Renteria lining into a game-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (2-4) allowed two runs and seven hits in 6 2-3
innings, striking out six.
</P>
<P>
   Estalella hit his three-run homer in the second inning and added
a solo shot, his fifth homer of the season, in the eighth. Bill
Mueller had a sacrifice fly in the fifth and J.T. Snow added an RBI
single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals starter Pat Hentgen (3-4), allowed four runs, five
hits and five walks in six innings. Hentgen has lost four straight
starts, matching his career worst, after winning his first three
starts of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in a week that Estalella has had a big
homer to support Hernandez. Last Tuesday, Estalella hit a grand
slam as Hernandez won 7-1 over the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
Notes: McGwire's 12 homers tie him with Sammy Sosa of the Chicago
Cubs and Steve Finley of the Arizona Diamondbacks, both of whom
also homered Monday, for the NL lead. ... Hentgen has allowed four
earned runs in each of his four losses. ... Bonds was thrown out
trying to steal second in the first inning, the first time he's
been caught stealing in six attempts this season. He also was
thrown out on the base paths in the eighth. ... Bonds, who walked
twice, went 0-for-2 and is hitless in his last 13 at-bats. ...
Sutton hit the Cardinals' third pinch-hit homer. Shawon Dunston and
Thomas Howard also have pinch-hit homers this season. ... Six of
Drew's 19 hits this season have been homers.

<HEADLINE> New Asian mosquito may be trouble  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A mosquito from Asia that is capable of
spreading the West Nile strain of encephalitis has been found in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Aedes japonicus is native to Japan and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In Army tests at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Md., japonicus was
found to be even better at spreading the West Nile strain than
Culex pipiens, commonly known as the house mosquito.
</P>
<P>
   But whether or not the insect will spread the virus in the wild
is not yet known.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a difference between a laboratory vector and a
real-world vector,'' said Michael Turell, the Army research
entomologist who conducted the japonicus vector test.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, ''If it only feeds on frogs in the real
world, it's not going to be important.''
</P>
<P>
   Turell said there are indications japonicus feeds on mammals,
birds and humans, but a real-world feeding study is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, scientists from Connecticut's agricultural
experiment station announced a search across the state for
japonicus after it was found on Long Island, N.Y., and in New
Jersey. Scientists suspect the mosquito came to the Northeast in
shipments of used tires from Asia. Water collects in tires,
providing a good breeding site.
</P>
<P>
   Japonicus was found in Connecticut tire dumps last summer. The
insect has since established itself in seven of the state's eight
counties, said Theodore Andreadis, chief medical entomologist for
the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been found in Tolland County yet, but that is
probably because surveys there have not been as extensive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Reynolds of the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention said gathering and testing of many mosquito species is
ongoing, and that only Culex pipiens has shown evidence of West
Nile so far.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile strain was detected in New York state last year,
the first documented occurrence in the Western Hemisphere. It
killed seven people in New York state and made at least 62 others
seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   Dead birds infected with the virus were found in New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Most people infected with the virus suffer flu-like symptoms.
But the most susceptible, the very young and elderly, can suffer
deadly brain swelling.
</P>
<P>
   All shoreline Connecticut towns and some inland communities have
been given either state money or larvicide to reduce breeding
populations this spring and summer.

<HEADLINE> Union, Red Cross optimistic that mediations will lead to a deal  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Red Cross officials and their unionized
workers have both expressed optimism that a new round of
negotiations will end week-old walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Over 200 technician-drivers, nurses, and phlebotomists walked
off the job May 1, resulting in the cancellation of blood drives
across the state.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were expected to head back to the bargaining table
today for the first time since April 27.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think rational heads will prevail and we should reach an
agreement. We've modified some of our outstanding issues,'' said
Jeffrey Jump, chief negotiator for the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees, Local 3145.
</P>
<P>
   The union is seeking better pay, benefits, scheduling and
retirement packages, said Jump. Current pay ranges from $10 to $22
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The agency contends it has made a fair and generous offer. In a
recent statement, the Red Cross said a strike would not affect
Connecticut's blood supply, but a prolonged walkout could
''seriously affect the region's ability to collect and distribute
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hopeful that this will be resolved,'' said Red Cross
spokeswoman Lynn Townshend.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal is made, workers could be back on the job as early as
Wednesday afternoon, Jump said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime the Red Cross has relied on blood from other
areas to maintain its supply. One blood drive in Norwalk remained
open Monday, and Madison was to be the sole location Tuesday,
Townshend said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight blood drives across the state were canceled Monday and
nine were off for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Townshend said the strike has not hurt the agency's service.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hospitals have been happy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bradford Sherbune at Hartford Hospital said blood supplies
are steady and no surgeries have been postponed or canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy to say, so far things are fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Zaorski, a spokeswoman at Yale-New Haven Hospital also
reported no problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Red Cross has been able to supply us with our usual supply
of blood,'' she said. ''Let's hope everything straightens out
soon.''

<HEADLINE> Motion for new trial rejected  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- A judge has rejected former New Milford
police Officer Scott Smith's claims of juror misconduct, and upheld
his conviction on manslaughter charges.
</P>
<P>
   Smith faces up to 40 years in prison when he is sentenced
Thursday for shooting a suspect in the back at point-blank range.
He was convicted in March.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Charles D. Gill on Monday said there was little evidence
of any juror misconduct during deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's lawyer, John J. Kelly, had cited nine instances of
possible misconduct, including allegations that one juror flashed a
badge and claimed special knowledge of police procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm obviously disappointed,'' said Kelly. ''But the denial
will be an additional appellate issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill met last week with all 12 jurors, questioning them about
some of the allegations. Kelly and prosecutors were present, but
could not ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased, but not surprised,'' said Waterbury State's
Attorney John Connelly, who prosecuted the case. ''We felt all
along these allegations were unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 34-page ruling Monday, Gill said that while one juror had
admitted violating his order not to visit the crime scene, it did
not affect the outcome of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Gill said the badge allegation could not be supported.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court, after listening and observing all 12 jurors on the
subject, finds that there is absolutely no basis for this claim of
misconduct,'' Gill wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Gill also rejected allegations two jurors had notes with them in
the jury room. Two jurors apparently had lists of questions they
wanted to discuss, which Gill said does not amount to misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the three jurors who said misconduct may have
occurred were well-intentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court hopes that with the reading of this opinion that
those three jurors will better understand the process and see the
law in a new light,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Acting New Milford police Chief Colin McCormick left the
courthouse without commenting on the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 28, is the first Connecticut police officer to be charged
with murder for an act in the line of duty. He said he shot suspect
Franklyn Reid after a foot chase in December 1998 because he
believed Reid was reaching for a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the shooting, Reid, 27, was unarmed. A short
folding knife was discovered in the pocket of a jacket found a few
feet away from his body.

<HEADLINE> Yale hosts new National Center for Children Exposed to Violence  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Yale's school of medicine is opening a
new center devoted to a single children's health issue -- violence.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 2.8 million reports of child abuse a year,
and 9 million children witness violent acts, school officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Children Exposed to Violence is being opened to
raise awareness of the lasting scars of violence for children and
to help to researchers and people working with children who have
been victims or exposed to violence, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced plans for the
new center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Behind each statistic is a vulnerable, feeling child,'' Holder
said.
</P>
<P>
   The center's objective is to prevent violence and children's
exposure to violence, intervene early and effectively with children
and hold perpetrators accountable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yale Medical School Dean Dr. David Kessler said the school was
gratified to be chosen to host the national center.
</P>
<P>
   The center will ''increase capacity of communities and
individuals across the country to respond to the complex needs of
children whose psychological and physical health is challenged
through exposure to the effects of violence,'' Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   The work of the center had been the responsibility of the U.S.
Justice Department. It is being moved to Yale to ensure its future,
Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven and Yale were a natural fit because of the city's long
community policing effort with the Yale Child Study Center that has
brought together the resources and connections other cities need to
combat abuse, Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine communities connected through the Justice Department's Safe
Start project will get training through the center. They will
coordinate child welfare, police, courts, doctors and schools to
prevent an overall approach to preventing violence and treating
children who are the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The other Safe Start communities are: Baltimore, Chicago,
Rochester, N.Y., San Francisco, Spokane, Wash., Chatham County,
N.C., Washington County, Maine, Pinellas County, Fla. and
Bridgeport, Conn.

<HEADLINE> O'Connor's legacy: still confronting the age in which he lived  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Even after death, Cardinal John O'Connor's
unwavering opposition to abortion, the death penalty and euthanasia
rang out from the altar of St. Patrick's Cathedral, a clear
indication of his legacy this time delivered as part of his eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a great legacy he has left us in his constant reminder
that the church must always be unambiguously pro-life,'' Cardinal
Bernard Law said during Monday's funeral Mass for New York's
longtime spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
   The remark sparked 75 seconds of applause, then a standing
ovation that spread from the back of St. Patrick's to the front,
where President Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and other politicians were seated.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the political heavyweights favor abortion rights, but
they eventually stood, too, some without applauding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see he hasn't left the pulpit,'' a smiling Law said of
O'Connor, his close friend, who died last week at age 80 after a
long battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the only ovation to reverberate through the great
cathedral. In a fond farewell, mourners broke into applause again
just as the cardinal's mahogany coffin was disappearing from their
view on its way to a crypt beneath the altar. Among them was
8-year-old Alexander Garrett, who has one leg but propped himself
on crutches in the front aisle to wave good-bye.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here to see him for the last time,'' said the boy, who
remembered that O'Connor once gave him a rosary.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 clergy took part in the ceremony, archdiocesan
spokesman the Rev. Paul Keenan said. Among them was Bishop Edward
Egan, of Bridgeport, Conn., the perceived front-runner to replace
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   So many priests wanted to help celebrate the Mass that some had
to do so from 40 rows back in the pews.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Paul Tolve, chaplain of the Westchester County
Corrections Department, said he went to St. Patrick's on Monday
because O'Connor had ordained him into the priesthood in 1984, soon
after the archbishop -- not yet a cardinal -- came to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to offer back what I could,'' Tolve said. ''He meant
a lot to me, and I always remembered that bond of ordination.''
</P>
<P>
   In a gentle demonstration of that devotion, hundreds of the
priests who filed past the cardinal's coffin touched it lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a kind of blessing,'' Keenan said.
</P>
<P>
   The principal celebrant was Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican
secretary of state, whose presence was ''a gift from Pope John
Paul,'' Keenan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lord, we don't complain because you have taken him from us,''
Sodano told the 3,500 people. ''But rather we will thank you for
giving him to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Clintons and Giuliani, other notables at the Mass
included Vice President Al Gore, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, former
President George Bush, New York Gov. George Pataki, Sens. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan and Charles Schumer and the cardinal's two sisters
and brother.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the church, hundreds of people stood behind police
barricades in record 91-degree heat, some mouthing the prayers and
hymns as the funeral Mass was broadcast over loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew Cardinal O'Connor; he was a man gifted by God with
wisdom and understanding,'' said Joan Gray Jangarathis, of Short
Hills, N.J. ''I had to be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Law's sermon, which praised O'Connor for making ''this pulpit
unique in the history of the Catholic Church in the United
States,'' was followed by a eulogy from Cardinal William Baum,
formerly of Washington and now in the Roman Curia. Baum said
O'Connor should be remembered for ''confronting the age in which he
lived.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a slow, mournful procession up and down the aisles of
the church as pallbearers carried the coffin to its crypt, which
was inscribed simply with a cross, a coat of arms and ''John
Cardinal O'Connor, 1920-2000. Archbishop 1984-2000.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the family returned from the entombment, organ, trumpet
and choir broke into a thunderous, triumphant hymn, ''Lift High the
Cross,'' which also was performed when O'Connor was installed as
head of the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the Mass of the Resurrection,'' Jangarathis said outside,
''and God gives us hope.''

<HEADLINE> Police: More officers, community efforts extend crime decline  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Putting more officers on the beat and
improving relationships with the community has paid off as violent
crime continues to decline in the state and nation, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Violent crimes fell 7 percent nationwide and dropped in the
state's five largest cities in 1999, according to preliminary
figures from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The downward trend, which extends back to 1992, is now nearly
three times longer than the second-longest decline, from 1982
through 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Waterbury Police Chief Edward Flaherty attributed the trend to a
shift toward community policing, a philosophy encouraging
partnerships between officers and the people they protect.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking for long-term solutions rather than just
responding to calls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal police departments have taken advantage of federal
grants which have paid for 100,000 more local officers nationwide,
said Cromwell Chief Anthony Salvatore, president-elect of the
Connecticut Police Chiefs Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're forming partnerships with the community, trying
different methods such as bicycle patrols and foot beats in major
urban areas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The good economy, and low unemployment, also has kept some
people from committing crimes of desperation, Salvatore said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts caution the decline is slowing and could be
bottoming out.
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenge is to be sure the numbers don't go back up to
any great degree,'' said Professor James Alan Fox of Northeastern
University in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's record prison population provides only ''temporary
relief,'' Fox added, ''because those people will come out of prison
and many will still have inadequate skills and bad attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI figures show that New Haven had the highest number of
violent crimes -- including murder, rape, aggravated assault,
burglary, larceny and arson -- with 12,009, a 9 percent drop from
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport, where crime fell 8.5 percent to 8,285, had the most
murders (30) and was ranked 69th of 226 cities tracked in the
number of murders committed.
</P>
<P>
   In Waterbury, total crime fell 11 percent to 6,400 in 1999.
Stamford saw a 23 percent decrease to 3,448.
</P>
<P>
   Violent crimes in Hartford fell 14 percent to 10,261 -- an
effect, police officials said, of a focus on quality of life issues
such as public drinking and loitering.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things like that create an opportunity and attitude for people
to engage in more serious crimes,'' said spokesman Sgt. Neil Dryfe.
''If you're hanging out on a corner waiting for someone to rob and
are arrested for loitering, you're never going to get the chance to
commit that robbery.''
</P>
<P>
   Crime was down not only nationwide, but also in every region of
the nation and in suburbs, rural areas and cities of all sizes,
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI figures come from more than 17,000 U.S. police agencies
and extend back to 1960.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Map Chromosome 21  </HEADLINE>
By RICK CALLAHAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists are making dramatic progress deciphering the human
genetic blueprint, having now collected nearly 90 percent of the 3
billion chemical letters that make up the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The latest milestone for the international Human Genome Project
is a detailed map of chromosome 21, the smallest for humans and the
one associated with Down syndrome, epilepsy, Lou Gehrig's disease
and Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes for which
scientists have laid out the order of genes that line each
chromosome, coiled strands of DNA that carry the chemical recipe
for each human. Chromosome 22 was mapped last fall.
</P>
<P>
   While they've made great strides, scientists admit the hardest
work -- figuring out what each gene does so drugs or therapies can
be devised to fight genetically linked ills -- lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And even tiny chromosome 21 appears to be a complex tangle.
</P>
<P>
   ''When one stares at a sequence like this, it makes you realize
how complex it really is,'' said Huntington Willard, chairman of
genetics at Case Western Reserve University. He was not involved in
the research.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just a simple string of 225 genes. It's really a
mess, a hornet's nest -- a hodgepodge of duplications, altered
sequences and arrangements that determine the health and welfare of
our species.''
</P>
<P>
   The human genetic pattern, or genome, is a biological map laying
out the sequence of 3 billion pairs of chemicals that make up the
DNA in each cell. All human DNA is contained within those 23 pairs
of chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   As the German- and Japanese-led team was unveiling its map of
chromosome 21 Monday, other members of the Human Genome Project
announced that the effort is moving into the final phase of
cataloging human genes, where experts will attack the difficult
sections that remain and proofread what has already been acquired.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we really have to roll up our sleeves and assess what
these genes are doing there, what role they play in causing
disease,'' said Francis Collins, chairman of the Human Genome
Project at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen laboratories across the globe are involved in the Human
Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   The team that mapped chromosome 21 found that it contains far
fewer genes than the 545 in chromosome 22, the second-smallest
chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   The relative sparseness of genes in chromosome 21 could mean the
total number of genes in human DNA is under 40,000 -- not the
100,000 or more that had previously been thought, said Andre
Rosenthal, a professor at the Institute for Molecular Biotechnology
in Jena, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   That means ''we are not so different from drosophila'' -- the
fruit fly -- ''or yeast,'' Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   The map of chromosome 21 is 99.7 percent complete, since
technical limitations prevented a complete mapping, said David
Patterson, an American scientist involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said the map may allow researchers to zero in on
specific genes in the chromosome that cause mental retardation in
people with Down syndrome and perhaps develop drugs to treat such
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once we can find the genes that are important for learning
problems, what we hope is that we'll be able to understand what
those genes do and somehow compensate for having an extra copy of
the gene,'' said Patterson, president of the Eleanor Roosevelt
Institute in Denver and chairman of the science advisory board of
the National Down Syndrome Society.
</P>
<P>
   Down syndrome occurs when a person is born with an extra, third
copy of chromosome 21. Down syndrome, the most common form of
genetically caused mental retardation, occurs in about one in 700
live births. Down syndrome can also cause congenital heart disease
and Alzheimer's by age 40.
</P>
<P>
   The team's findings will be published in Thursday's issue of the
journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph Tanzi, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical
School, said the chromosome map could eventually shed light on why
people with Down syndrome have a very low rate of breast, lung and
gastrointestinal cancers. It could be that an extra copy of
chromosome 21 has tumor-suppressing qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ''One can argue that an extra dose of a gene will usually be a
bad thing, but once in awhile it can be a good thing. It can be
protective,'' Tanzi said.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Genome Project expects to have a rough draft of the
entire human genetic blueprint done this summer. The public
project, which is expected finish its work by 2003, is competing
against a private company, Celera Genomics Corp. of Rockville, Md.,
which hopes to sell the information to pharmaceutical companies and
others.

<HEADLINE> Publishers Attend AP Annual Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Associated Press is introducing a series of
Internet initiatives to enhance the value of its state news reports
and political coverage to members, president and CEO Louis D.
Boccardi told the AP annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of 1,546 member newspapers gathered Monday on
the first day of the Newspaper Association of America's convention.
</P>
<P>
   AP Chairman Donald E. Newhouse opened the session, which
included a conversation between Boccardi and Alan Diaz, the
photographer who took the news cooperative's photographs of Elian
Gonzalez being removed from the home of Miami relatives last month.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the program were a panel on the 2000 election and talks
by Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi said the coming year would bring ''an ever-stronger
world and national news report; further exploration of the
opportunities and challenges the Internet presents, (and) sharper
focus on better performance on all levels.''
</P>
<P>
   He announced the introduction of the AP Election Center, ''for
online readers who want as much detail as they can get on the
candidates, the issues and the campaigns from the White House to
the statehouse.'' This will be an Internet service that members can
link to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   AP will also offer a site called AP Politics, designed as a
resource for reporters and editors covering campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet initiative called Your AP will allow editors to
access election results in November as soon as the come into the AP
system, rather than waiting for updates to move on the wire.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll know what we know when we know it,'' Boccardi said.
</P>
<P>
   Your AP will be an ongoing resource that keeps members up to
date on the AP news report and developments within the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi said state news reports soon will be delivered in a
format that will enable editors of online editions to post them
easily to newspaper Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The AP's continuing commitment to improving state reports has
led to two new Chicago-based positions, Boccardi said. One is a new
writing coach -- AP's third -- and the other is a new deputy director
of state news.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Gore said he was open to a change in federal
rules that prohibit the same company from owning a newspaper and TV
or radio station in the same area, although he noted that it is up
to the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said he supported revising estate tax laws that create
hardships for families trying to pass a newspaper on from one
generation to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who spoke at the event's luncheon, said President
Clinton was approaching his summit talks with Russian President
Vladimir Putin with an open mind on the subject of U.S. missile
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton decides later this year whether to proceed with an
anti-missile program, he will weigh potential threats as well as
the merits of the technology and the costs, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who will meet with Clinton in Moscow June 4-5, strongly
opposes even the limited program Clinton is considering -- 100
launchers and improved radar designed to stop intercontinental
ballistic missiles that some administration officials are convinced
North Korea, Iran and other so-called ''rogue states'' could fire
at the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, the photographer, said on the morning the 6-year-old Elian
was seized by federal agents, ''I had the instinct, the hunch, that
something was going to go down.'' Diaz said when the raid began he
sprinted into the house and set up in the room where the boy was
being hidden in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   His overriding memory of the raid? ''All I could hear, and all I
could remember, was Elian crying,'' Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi also moderated a discussion of political campaigns with
three AP correspondents. The panel, titled ''A Conversation:
Campaign 2000,'' included Walter Mears, AP vice president and
Washington columnist; Ron Fournier, chief political writer in
Washington; and Marc Humbert, New York State political editor based
in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Mears noted candidates try to avoid negative attacks on their
opponents these days because they think voters don't like it. But
Fournier pointed out that ''the new form of negative campaigning
seems to be to accuse your opponent of going negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the meeting began with the announcement of election
results for the board of directors, held by all-mail balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Four incumbents and three new members were elected to the board.
</P>
<P>
   Elected to new terms were John J. Curley, chairman and CEO,
Gannett Co. Inc., Wilmington (Del.) News-Journal; Newhouse,
president, Advance Publications Inc., Newark (N.J.) Star-Ledger;
John W. Madigan, chairman, president and CEO, Tribune Co., Chicago
Tribune and Orage Quarles III, publisher, Raleigh (N.C.) News &AMP;
Observer.
</P>
<P>
   New members are Walter E. Hussman Jr., president and CEO, WEHCO
Media Inc., Arkansas Democrat-Gazette; Julie Inskeep Walda,
publisher, Fort Wayne (Ind.) Journal Gazette; and Sue Mayborn,
president and publisher, Temple (Texas) Daily Telegram. Walda was
selected to fill one year left in the term of Richard J.
Harrington, who is stepping down. Mayborn was selected to represent
a city of less than 50,000 population.
</P>
<P>
   At a reorganization meeting later in the day, Newhouse,
president of Advance Publications Inc. and of The Star-Ledger of
Newark, N.J., was re-elected chairman of the AP. David E. Easterly,
president and COO of Cox Enterprises Inc., representing the Dayton
(Ohio) Daily News, was elected vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi was re-elected president and chief executive officer of
the news cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Other AP management officers re-elected to one-year terms were
Patrick T. O'Brien, senior vice president and chief financial
officer; James M. Donna, vice president and secretary; and vice
presidents Vincent J. Alabiso, Claude E. Erbsen, Mears, John W.
Reid, Thomas E. Slaughter, Wick Temple and James R. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan P. Wolman, executive editor, also was elected vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel M. Boruch was re-elected treasurer, and Salvatore Focella
and Ann Randolph were re-elected assistant treasurers. Other AP
management officers re-elected were assistant secretaries Lilo
Jedelhauser and Greg Groce.

<HEADLINE> Princeton To Alter China Program  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Princeton University officials have agreed
to change its summer language program in Beijing after Chinese
educators said textbook references to the country's
population-control policy and the independence of Taiwan are
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at Beijing Normal University, the site of
Princeton's 9-year-old program, also objected to lessons that
referred to Chinese drivers not yielding for pedestrians and the
behavior of wildly cheering crowds at a volleyball game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, things that hurt the feelings of the Chinese people
cannot appear in teaching materials,'' said Chen Fu, vice president
of Beijing Normal University's Foreign Chinese Education College.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said she wasn't aware of orders from higher authorities to
the school telling it to alter Princeton's materials.
</P>
<P>
   After a Beijing Normal teacher wrote a critical article about
the program, the Chinese university officials told the Princeton
professor who runs it, C.P. Chou, to delete eight lessons and alter
large parts of others in textbooks
</P>
<P>
   Chou said Monday he will make the required changes in time for
the nine-week program to begin at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the university banned one of the program's
textbooks, ''A Trip to China,'' Chou said. Officials objected to
lessons that stated there was no toilet paper in public bathrooms
in China, among other things, Chou said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important for the program, for us to make decisions about
what to teach and what not to teach,'' said Chou. ''But that's not
(how) the host institution sees it.''
</P>
<P>
   About 120 students plan to attend this summer's program,
considered one of China's most prestigious. The $3,900 program
offers four levels of language classes, beginner to advanced, for
undergraduates. The majority of students who attend are American;
one-third come from Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Link, Princeton's leading Chinese-language scholar and a
co-director of the program, said the textbooks do not take a
political position on issues such as Taiwan and the family planning
policy, which limits most couples in China to only one child.
</P>
<P>
   He said the goal was simply to compel students to try to express
themselves in a new language.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important to have the students want to say something,''
said Link. ''Then you can correct their language.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the changes have nothing to do with his involvement
with the program. Link, who has written articles critical of China
on human rights issues, was stopped in Beijing in 1996 and ordered
to return to America, and has not been issued a visa since.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska, W.Va. To Hold Primaries  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN O'HANLON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Two of Nebraska's highest-ranking officials
squared off today in a Republican primary for the seat being
vacated by Sen. Bob Kerrey, the only Democrat in the state's
congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Don Stenberg and Secretary of State Scott Moore
were expected to lead the four-way GOP primary, with the winner
likely to take on former Gov. Ben Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who spent two terms in office and left in 1999 with an
80 percent approval rating, faced token opposition in the
Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   In another closely watched race today, former University of
Nebraska football coach Tom Osborne had two opponents in a GOP
congressional primary. Although farming and other issues have
dominated the race, voters in this football-crazy state are clearly
fascinated with Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   In West Virginia, Republican Gov. Cecil Underwood faced a
painting contractor, a housewife and an unemployed construction
worker in the GOP primary. Underwood, 77, was so confident that he
did not campaign and planned to spend election night watching a
minor league baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   The more dramatic West Virginia race was for the House seat
being left by Rep. Bob Wise, who is running in the Democratic
primary to challenge Underwood.
</P>
<P>
   Four Democrats were vying for the seat Wise has held since 1982,
including Secretary of State Ken Hechler, an 85-year-old former
congressman whose political career dates back to the New Deal. He
faces popular state Sen. Martha Walker, Harrison County
Commissioner Beth Taylor and lawyer Jim Humphreys, who spent $3
million of his own money and leads in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will face Republican Shelley Moore Capito, a member
of the state House of Delegates and the daughter of former Gov.
Arch Moore Jr., the state's only three-term governor.
</P>
<P>
   There were also presidential primaries today in Nebraska and
West Virginia, but both were essentially meaningless since George
W. Bush and Al Gore have sealed their parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, Republicans were giddy when Kerrey, a rare Democrat
in the conservative state, declined to run for a third term. Kerrey
instead will become president of New School University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Stenberg, who recently defended Nebraska's ban against so-called
partial birth abortions before the Supreme Court, had been running
for the Senate for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerrey's decision prompted Moore, one of Stenberg's most
prominent backers, to enter the race. Moore has raised $224,000
this year, compared with $144,000 for Stenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Agribusinessman David Hergert and former state Sen. John DeCamp
were also on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne considered running for the GOP Senate nomination but
instead decided to seek the House seat held by Republican Bill
Barrett, who is retiring after five terms.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne's opponents, longtime state GOP leader John Gale and
state Board of Education member Kathy Wilmot, have tried not to let
the former coach's celebrity hinder their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne, who coached Nebraska for a quarter-century and led the
Cornhuskers to three national championships in the 1990s, would
face Democrat Rollie Reynolds in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people in the state of Nebraska have had a chance to
see me operate up close and personal for 25 years,'' Osborne said.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Honor O'Connor  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor's unwavering position on
social issues rang out from the altar of St. Patrick's Cathedral, a
sign his influence would long outlast his eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a great legacy he has left us in his constant reminder
that the church must always be unambiguously pro-life,'' Cardinal
Bernard Law said during Monday's funeral Mass for the spiritual
leader of 2.4 million Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The remark sparked 75 seconds of applause, then a standing
ovation that spread from the back of the cathedral to the front,
where President Clinton, Senate seat rivals Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and other politicians were seated.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the political heavyweights favor abortion rights. They
were the last to get to their feet and looked a little reluctant,
but they eventually stood, some without applauding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see he hasn't left the pulpit,'' a smiling Law said of
O'Connor, his close friend, who died Wednesday at age 80 after a
battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the only ovation to reverberate through the great
cathedral. Mourners again broke into applause just as the
cardinal's mahogany coffin was disappearing from their view on its
way to a crypt beneath the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was 8-year-old Alexander Garrett, who has one leg but
propped himself on crutches in the front aisle to wave good-bye.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here to see him for the last time,'' said the boy, who
remembered that O'Connor once gave him a rosary.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 clergy took part in the ceremony, said
archdiocesan spokesman the Rev. Paul Keenan. Among them was Bishop
Edward Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., the perceived front-runner to
replace O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   In a gentle demonstration of devotion, hundreds of the priests
who filed past the cardinal's coffin touched it lightly. ''It's a
kind of blessing,'' Keenan said.
</P>
<P>
   The principal celebrant was Angelo Cardinal Sodano, the Vatican
secretary of state whose presence was ''a gift from Pope John
Paul,'' Keenan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lord, we don't complain because you have taken him from us,''
Sodano told the 3,500 people. ''But rather we will thank you for
giving him to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Clintons and Giuliani, other notables at the Mass
included Vice President Al Gore and his Republican rival for the
presidency, Gov. George W. Bush; Bush's father, former President
George Bush; Gov. George Pataki; Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and
Charles Schumer; and the cardinal's two sisters and brother.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the church, hundreds of people stood behind police
barricades in 91-degree heat, some mouthing the prayers and hymns
as the funeral Mass was broadcast over loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew Cardinal O'Connor; he was a man gifted by God with
wisdom and understanding,'' said Joan Gray Jangarathis of Short
Hills, N.J. ''I had to be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   As archbishop, O'Connor placed himself at the center of some of
the nation's most heated debates, angering many with his staunch
support of the Catholic church's positions on abortion, the death
penalty and homosexuality even as he charmed many critics with his
warm wit.
</P>
<P>
   Law's sermon, which praised O'Connor for making ''this pulpit
unique in the history of the Catholic Church in the United
States,'' was followed by a eulogy from Cardinal William Baum,
formerly of Washington and now in the Roman Curia. Baum said
O'Connor should be remembered for ''confronting the age in which he
lived.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a slow, mournful procession up and down the aisles of
the church as pallbearers carried the coffin to its crypt, which
was inscribed simply with a cross, a coat of arms and ''John
Cardinal O'Connor, 1920-2000. Archbishop 1984-2000.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the pallbearers returned from the entombment, organ,
trumpet and choir broke into a thunderous, triumphant hymn, ''Lift
High the Cross,'' which also was performed when O'Connor was
installed as head of the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the Mass of the Resurrection,'' Jangarathis said outside,
''and God gives us hope.''

<HEADLINE> Engineer Developing Wireless System  </HEADLINE>
By ELLIOTT MINOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- Implanted transmitters and thinking computers
may someday watch over the flocks in Georgia chicken houses,
delivering food and adjusting comfort levels far more precisely
than their human caretakers ever could.
</P>
<P>
   Takoi Hamrita, an assistant engineering professor at the
University of Georgia, has linked dime-sized radio transmitters
embedded under the chickens' breast bones with computers that use
artificial intelligence. Her research goal is to reduce heat stress
and to regulate the birds' diets for maximum growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''When this is developed and commercialized, growers will really
have an intelligent assistant,'' said Hamrita, who was invited to
Washington recently to give a demonstration at the Capitol. ''This
way of supervising and controlling something is not new. It's very
common in other industries.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is the nation's leading poultry-producing state with a
$13.1 billion industry that generates about 40 percent of the
state's total agricultural income.
</P>
<P>
   Hamrita says her system, still in the early stages of
development, will mean safer food for consumers by reducing the
risk of disease outbreaks in chicken houses. It will also mean
higher profits for producers by reducing the number of birds that
die from heat stress.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken houses, just like human houses, already have electronic
systems that control heat and humidity. Many chicken houses even
have computer controls that measure the temperature in the house
and adjust cooling fans accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, heat stress remains a major problem and producers lose a
significant number of chickens because of overheating, especially
during Georgia's hot summers.
</P>
<P>
   Hamrita believes she can improve production by allowing the
birds to tell the computer when they are uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   She uses transmitters, painlessly implanted using a local
anesthetic when a chicken is 3 weeks old, to monitor the bird's
physiology. That information is relayed to a computer that is
''trained'' to respond to the ever-changing transmitter signals.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the moment, the sensors tell us only the birds' deep-body
temperature,'' she said. ''Eventually, though, they will also tell
us their respiration and heart rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a portion of the chickens in a house would need sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Her studies so far have involved 36 chickens, including a dozen
with implanted sensors. The next step is to try the system in a
commercial chicken house with about 65,000 birds, including 100
with sensors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're almost ready to do that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The reusable sensors would be the biggest expense, costing
between $5,000 and $10,000 to implant in 100 birds, she said. The
rest of the system would cost about $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Modern chickens are genetically different from the yard birds of
the past, which were more hardy, but provided less meat, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's chickens gain 50 percent more weight on half the feed
than they did 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to give you the best they can give you, but
you're going to have to give them the best conditions, as well,''
she said. ''We have established the fact that physiological
responses are a great indicator of what's going on in a house.''

<HEADLINE> New Blood Thinner Shows Promise  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A new class of blood thinner shows promise in
warding off dangerous blood clots after surgery and is more
convenient to take than the standard drug, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary study of the medication on people undergoing
knee or hip replacement surgery, those who took the new drug had
half the chance of developing clots in their legs compared to those
given the usual treatment of injections of the anti-clotting agent
heparin.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Myerson, a national spokesman for the American Heart
Association and a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins University, said
that while the test results were a good start, it was too early to
tell how well the drug will work and whether it is safe.
</P>
<P>
   The study, presented Friday at a blood clotting conference in
Portugal, was paid for by Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company
AstraZeneca, which developed the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ''This medicine appears promising,'' said Myerson, who was not
connected with the study. But, he added, ''while the data look
excellent, it would be premature to recommend the medication be
used on a widespread basis.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the next step was for other researchers independent of
the drug maker to replicate the findings in their own studies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the advantages of the experimental drug, which does not
yet have a name, is that is can be injected or taken as a pill,
whereas heparin must be injected, said Dr. Bengt Eriksson, a
professor of orthopedic surgery at the Sahlgrenska University
hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden, who headed the study.
</P>
<P>
   Clots form during surgery when the wall of a blood vessel is
broken and particles in the blood called platelets become activated
to plug the break.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest worry with an anti-clotting drug is that it will
cause bleeding because there is such a slim margin between it doing
its job and overdoing it.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pill given after surgery to prevent clots -- warfarin
-- but it must be carefully monitored with regular blood tests to
ensure it is not making the blood too thick to flow freely or too
thin to form a scab over a cut.
</P>
<P>
   Foods containing vitamin K, such as green leafy vegetables,
affect warfarin's performance by encouraging several of the
clotting substances the drug targets. That makes it difficult to
maintain the right concentration of the drug in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been searching for a new type of drug that could
overcome some of those problems.
</P>
<P>
   The new drug prevents clots in a different way from both heparin
and warfarin, acting in the final stage of the formation of a blood
clot by inhibiting the activity of a substance called Thrombin.
</P>
<P>
   Thrombin converts a clotting factor dissolved in the blood into
long strands that radiate from the clump and form a net to entrap
more platelets and blood cells so that the clump can grow bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Heparin and warfarin intervene earlier in the clotting process,
producing a knock-on effect on actions that would occur later.
</P>
<P>
   Eriksson said that because the new drug is broken down
differently and its performance is not affected by vitamin K, the
concentration of the medicine does not swing as much and regular
blood tests are not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   During the experiment, 285 people were given the new drug, first
by injection right before the operation and then as a pill
afterward twice daily for about 8 days. Another 308 were given one
heparin injection, and another fake one, a day.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors x-rayed the subjects' legs at the end of the study to
check for blood clots. A total of 43 in the experimental group, or
15 percent, had clots, while 87, or 28.2 percent, of the people on
heparin had developed them.
</P>
<P>
   The occurrence of bleeding was about the same, and there
appeared to be no adverse reactions to the new drug.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Leader Still Rides High  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- With less than three weeks to go
before President Hugo Chavez's re-election bid, Venezuela's economy
is mired in recession, and unemployment and crime are at historic
highs -- enough to cripple even the best of politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet polls show Chavez with a 20-point lead over his closest
rival in the May 28 vote. Though not assured, his victory is
extremely likely.
</P>
<P>
   Most Venezuelans believe the 45-year-old former coup leader when
he promises that the fruits of his ''Bolivarian revolution'' will
soon be felt. For better or worse, he has connected with the
Venezuelan people like few leaders before him, even though he no
longer enjoys the 80 percent-plus approval ratings he had a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Going into its sixth election in little more than a year,
Venezuela is a poorer nation than it was when Chavez took office in
February 1999. It is also more dangerous and more divided, with a
future far less certain.
</P>
<P>
   But in the slums and shantytowns that are home to the majority
of the South American nation's 23 million people, hope has been
rekindled.
</P>
<P>
   With fiery rhetoric invoking the ideals of 19th century South
American liberator Simon Bolivar, Chavez has capitalized on the
failure of successive governments to distribute the country's vast
oil wealth more equitably.
</P>
<P>
   He has done away with the traditional political parties that
ruled Venezuela for decades. The only other candidate with a chance
to win on May 28, Francisco Arias Cardenas, helped Chavez stage his
failed 1992 coup attempt and shares Chavez's claim of independence
from the country's discredited political class -- although Arias has
since accused the president of abandoning the ideals behind their
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chavez has been a successful revolutionary,'' said pollster
Luis Vicente Leon. ''He's made it so that the entire national
debate today is taking place only within his Bolivarian movement.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president's destruction of the old political order has
not been accompanied by the construction of a new one.
</P>
<P>
   The country has fallen into a kind of political and economic
limbo after Chavez pushed through a new constitution last year.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a power vacuum from the new constitution, Chavez's
leftist coalition hand-picked an interim legislature, a new supreme
court and a national electoral council in moves that critics
denounced as an assault on the separation of powers.
</P>
<P>
   The political uncertainty may help explain why, for the first
time in memory, a boom in international oil prices has not
translated into a recovery for the country's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his ''social revolution'' has been supported by
elections, critics say Chavez has meant less democracy for
Venezuela because of a dangerous concentration of power in his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters insist the limbo will end with this month's
elections for president, a new unicameral legislature, governors,
mayors and local councils -- part of the new constitution's
requirement for ''re-legitimizing'' public powers.
</P>
<P>
   But the electoral process itself has come under fire for being
stacked against the opposition. Last week, the Carter Center issued
a report expressing concern over the ''high level of uncertainty
and distrust generated by the provisional nature of the legal
framework and the method of appointment of the electoral
authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the Bolivarian revolution looks more like mob rule.
When Arias tried to campaign in a Caracas slum last Friday, Chavez
supporters threw bricks, food and trash at him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Chavez asked his supporters to refrain from hurling
objects at Arias ''because indifference hurts more than a rock.''
He added: ''The people cannot understand how someone who once spoke
of revolution is now allied with the most rancid oligarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Venezuela's middle and upper classes have
flocked to Arias, seeing in him their best chance of unseating
Chavez. For them, hating the president has become a national
pastime.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest theater ticket in Caracas is a show called ''The
Re-constituents,'' a play on words of the pro-Chavez assembly that
rewrote the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   During a performance last week, comedian Laureano Marquez said
he'd like to see more of Chavez's longwinded speeches that often go
on for hours. ''While he talks, he's not governing, and that's a
strategic advantage,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez knows he doesn't need middle and upper class Venezuelans
to win elections.
</P>
<P>
   But to govern successfully, he does need their money and
expertise. Considering last year's capital flight of $5 billion and
widespread ''brain drain,'' they are giving neither.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Ochoa Antich, defense minister during Chavez's 1992
coup attempt, said most army officers have also thrown their
support behind Arias and are ready to wrest power away from Chavez
as soon as he loses popular support.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm almost sure that within a short time, there will be a
military conspiracy in Venezuela,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mongolians Getting Back Their Names  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KOHN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) -- In the decade since they overthrew
communist one-party rule, Mongolians have regained their freedom,
their animal herds and their traditions. Now, they are getting back
their names.
</P>
<P>
   A national campaign to restore the traditional clan names the
communists suppressed after taking power nearly 80 years ago is
prompting Mongolians to rifle through closets, telephone distant
cousins and trek back to ancestral homes in search of forgotten
family trees.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration of clan names is part of a Mongolian cultural
revival that has swept this central Asian nation since
demonstrations in 1990 ushered in multiparty democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist temples have reopened. Livestock herds, the lifeblood
of rural Mongolia, have been redistributed to nomadic families
after being collectivized by the communists.
</P>
<P>
   Genghis Khan, the legendary conqueror who united Mongol tribes
into an empire in the 13th century, is again a national hero. His
face adorns everything from money to vodka bottles. Now many want
to take his clan's name as their own -- so many that bureaucrats are
worried about confusion.
</P>
<P>
   To aid people in their search and cut down on duplication, the
government has published a directory of names.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the process has been stressful.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year my uncles and aunts were choosing different names.
It was like the family was breaking up,'' said A. Delgermaa, a
24-year-old translator. ''But we had a family reunion over the New
Year and jointly chose a new name. We are called Bayankhairkan,
which is a mountain near my father's home.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally Mongolians were known by their clan and given
names. The People's Revolutionary Party, which ruled Mongolia as a
satellite state of the Soviet Union, abolished clan names in 1925
to try to bury the nation's ''feudal past.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow feared allegiance to clans, rather than socialism, could
create the basis for rebellion. Many family records were
confiscated, lost, destroyed or simply forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The suppression of clan names left most Mongolians with just
their given name, adding their father's name or initial to avoid
confusion with others sharing the same first name. Even today,
flipping through a Mongolian telephone directory reveals rows and
rows of Bolds, Jargalsaikhans and other single names.
</P>
<P>
   Experts began work in 1990 on restoring clan names as part of
efforts to revive Mongolian culture. The current pro-democracy
government inherited the plan when it ousted the Revolutionary
Party in 1996. It has begun issuing glossy new identity cards with
given, paternal and clan names to all people aged 16 and over -- 63
percent of Mongolia's 2.4 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The fortunate rediscovered their family name from relatives or
records that survived the communist era. But others have had to
invent them. Guragchaa, Mongolia's first and only cosmonaut, chose
''Sansar'' -- or cosmos -- for his clan name.
</P>
<P>
   Yadamsuren, a 58-year-old engineer, found his clan name,
Hagchud, from a family history that his father recounted on his
death bed to a Buddhist lama in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The lama smuggled the record, which went back eight generations,
to eastern Mongolia. Yadamsuren recovered a copy of it from
relatives there who had hidden it from communist authorities.
</P>
<P>
   To help the nameless, a team from Mongolia's Academy of Sciences
toured the country, questioning the elderly and studying ancient
manuscripts for a recently published book with more than 1,200
names and maps detailing where clans lived.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nomadic clans lived and moved together, but within the same
region,'' said team member Ts. Tsedev, now known as Taij Ts.
Tsedev. ''If people know where their ancestors lived, they can look
at the maps in the book and probably figure out what their clan
name was.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the name game has frustrated so many people, officials
are planning a ''Festival of Families'' in October. It will include
a friendly competition to see which families know their lineage
best and experts to help those who don't have a name.

<HEADLINE> Rape Charge for Cruise Ship Workers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two Carnival Cruise Line employees have been
charged with raping two female passengers aboard the cruise ship
Elation while it was docked off the coast of Puerto Vallarta,
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The women, who are in their 20s, told the FBI that crew members
Desmond Abraham and Julio Delgado followed them into a cabin, tore
their clothes off and assaulted them after they returned from shore
drunk on May 3.
</P>
<P>
   The crew members left the cabin after the alleged assault, the
women said, and one of the women called her father, who was on
board. The FBI arrested the men after the ship arrived here Sunday
after a seven-day cruise that included stops in Cabo San Lucas,
Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham was ordered held without bail Monday by U.S. Magistrate
Judge Charles Eick. Delgado will be held at least until a detention
hearing Thursday. Arraignment is scheduled for May 30.
</P>
<P>
   In affidavits filed Monday, Abraham, of Dominica in the West
Indies, and Delgado, of Nicaragua, denied the charges. They said
the women approached them in a hall of the ship and began kissing
them. Both said they kissed the women but denied having sex with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Ship's doctor Jamie King examined the women shortly after the
alleged incident. In an affidavit, he said did not detect any
bruising or bleeding or traces of semen.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Carnival Cruise Lines, based in Miami, said they
have fired Abraham and Delgado and are cooperating with the
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Three Ex-Presidents Back China Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With just a few weeks before a vote, President
Clinton has invited two former presidents and top officials from
past administrations to the White House to help him twist the arms
of congressmen who remain undecided about granting permanent normal
trade relations to China.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents Ford and Carter were to join Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore in the East Room today to rally support for the
landmark trade legislation, which would ease the Asian nation's
entrance into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Former secretaries of state, including Henry Kissinger, and past
national security advisers also were to stand with the president.
And the Democratic Leadership Council planned to hand Clinton a
national petition signed by more than 140 state and local elected
leaders who support normal trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raiser Monday night for Rep. Baron Hill, D-Ind., in
Bethesda, Md., Clinton said failing to pass the measure would have
a negative effect on national security and could heighten tension
between China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''China is the biggest country in the world and in somewhere
between 30 and 50 years it will have the biggest economy, unless
India outstrips them, which is conceivable,'' Clinton said. ''And
when that happens, are we going to have a working relationship with
them, or is there going to be a new cold war?''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton got key support from three former presidents
and a highly respected Republican economist, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The White House released a letter signed by Ford, Carter and
President Bush pledging their unified support for normal trade
relations status for China.
</P>
<P>
   ''In economic terms, the case is clear,'' the former presidents
wrote in an open letter. ''The agreement to bring China into the
WTO is the product of more than 13 years of tough negotiations
conducted by four administrations, Democratic and Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan pledged support for the measure, saying China's
membership in the WTO would promote economic development, reduce
poverty in China and push the nation to offer more individual
rights for its 1 billion people. ''China's citizens will come to
have greater choice about their lifestyles and employment and to
enjoy enhanced access to communication and information from around
the globe,'' Greenspan wrote on May 5 in a letter to House Banking
Committee Chairman James Leach, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ''As China's citizens experience economic gains, so will the
American firms that trade in their expanding markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, Republican leaders and U.S. business
groups have been lobbying lawmakers for weeks to get the
legislation passed. If the House approves the measure in a vote
expected the week of May 22, Senate passage is likely.
</P>
<P>
   The two top House Democratic leaders oppose the legislation,
suggesting it will hurt U.S. jobs. And labor and human rights
groups against extending permanent trade relations status say an
annual review of China's trading privileges gives the United States
leverage over China's human rights, environmental, religious and
labor policies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's support of the legislation has left his presidential
campaign at odds with some labor leaders who oppose it. The vice
president says organized labor is split on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first group, the majority, after extensive discussions,
agreed to endorse me in spite of the fact that we disagree on this
issue,'' Gore told the annual meeting of The Associated Press on
Monday in New York. ''The other group is made up of those who feel
so strongly about it that even though they agree with me on most
other things, they haven't endorsed me.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Poised To Endorse Bush  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Despite lingering differences over tax cuts
and campaign finance reform, John McCain was ready today to endorse
former GOP presidential rival George W. Bush following their first
face-to-face meeting since a bitter primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator decided against making a more climactic
announcement near this summer's Republican National Convention
after tiring of what one adviser, speaking on condition of
anonymity, characterized as the Bush's campaign's attempts to
manage the meeting and spin its outcome in the media.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told his staff of the decision after receiving a call
from Bush on Sunday. When word leaked out Monday, McCain was
furious, threatening to reverse course and instructing his staff to
meet him an hour before today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Aides expected plans to proceed as announced because, in the
words of one adviser, ''he wanted to get it behind him and move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in this battleground state, McCain telegraphed his
intentions during a news conference that followed a book signing.
Asked whether he would consider endorsing Bush immediately if he
''liked what he heard,'' McCain replied, ''Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town, the Texas governor told reporters he would welcome
McCain's help in the tight race against his Democratic presidential
rival, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's going to be up to John. Of course I'd like his help,''
Bush said. ''He has said out loud on more than one occasion he was
looking forward to campaigning for me for president. I take him for
his word.''
</P>
<P>
   Unity serves the political ambitions of both men.
</P>
<P>
   Bush needs McCain's help to court independent-minded voters and
unite the GOP for a tough race against Vice President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whose presidential ambitions didn't perish with his
campaign, wants to convince Republicans he is a party warrior
worthy of a second look in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, McCain was concerned that looking too eager to cozy
up to Bush would tarnish his image as a straight-shooting outsider.
And Bush was wary of being seen as begging for McCain's support,
since doing so would make him look weak or desperate against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers for both men expected a cordial meeting lasting about
two hours. Planning to meet face-to-face -- without aides -- the two
had on their agenda political reform, military reform, education,
Social Security and McCain's role in the campaign, including the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   During the primaries, Bush argued for a five-year, $460 billion
tax cut. McCain said the country could not afford it and the money
would be better spent shoring up Social Security and paying down
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The two also clashed on campaign finance reform. McCain argued
for a ban on all party-building, ''soft-money'' donations. Bush
disagreed, saying that would give an unfair advantage to Democratic
candidates, who can benefit from political donations funneled
through labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush tried to dilute the differences Sunday by telephoning
McCain and saying he looked forward to the session, according to
several officials familiar with the conversation. Officials said
Bush expressed his admiration for the senator during the brief
exchange and thanked him for speaking out in favor of the Texan's
Social Security plans.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation followed several tense negotiating sessions in
which the two sides failed to reach agreement on a written
statement that could be distributed to reporters after the session.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain team was pushing for consensus on issues such as
campaign finance reform and Social Security, but Bush's aides were
said to balk at the notion of issuing a written communique.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had grown impatient with the behind-the-scenes sniping
that dominated talks since Bush knocked him from the race, aides
said, and didn't want to have to deal with the Bush operation any
longer.
</P>
<P>
   And thus, the pair settled on the private meeting followed by
the news conference stressing their unity, advisers said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Web Site Contains His Cartoons  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE PFLEGER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore as the Terminator? In his dreams. Or,
it turns out, in his cartoon collection.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's official Web site now boasts some of Gore's
favorite jabs from his personal collection of local and national
editorial cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   There's Democrat Gore, after his makeover for the presidential
campaign, with wild new hair and a pair of lungs in hand -- a
reference to a sometimes criticized interview in which Gore said
that to win a candidate has to ''rip your opponent's lungs out and
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Hasta la vista, baby,'' a Terminator-esque Gore says.
</P>
<P>
   Or check out President Clinton thanking Gore -- on crutches -- for
hurting his Achilles' tendon in 1994 as part of an alleged plan
''to keep the focus on health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's collection includes some of the more gentle jokes he's
suffered throughout his years in public life. Absent are some of
the artists' favorite spoofs of Gore, including his more recent
claims about inventing the Internet or inspiring the movie ''Love
Story'' with his wife Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   His Republican presidential rival, George W. Bush, doesn't boast
a similar collection for cyber-consumption. But aides and friends
occasionally give the Texas governor political cartoons that poke
fun at him, said Bush spokesman Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has about 30 cartoons framed at the Governor's Mansion,
McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   No word on the size of Gore's collection, though over the years
he has accumulated many cartoons as gifts from friends and
sometimes the artists.
</P>
<P>
   He appears to take jokes about reinventing government best --
three out of five cartoon strips on his Web site feature the veep's
pet project.
</P>
<P>
   In one, bureaucrats from the ''Federal Bureau of Horse &AMP; Buggy
Right of Ways'' panic when they see Gore is coming.
</P>
<P>
   In another, Clinton sends Gore, a train engineer, to Capitol
Hill on the ''Big Government'' express for wind tunnel tests.
</P>
<P>
   And a brontosaurus symbolizing big government rents the Al Gore
workout video -- ''Streamlining Government'' -- to slim down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finish chewing that branch, and let's begin,'' Gore barks.

<HEADLINE> Lift Loss Said Likely Osprey Cause  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Marine Corps investigators believe last
month's MV-22 Osprey crash that killed 19 Marines probably was
caused by a loss of aerodynamic lift that forced the aircraft into
a fatal nose dive.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators are close to ruling out mechanical failure as
a cause and do not believe the investigation will find a need to
redesign the aircraft, a unique hybrid of airplane and helicopter,
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also have found no indication of recklessness by
the pilot, Maj. John A. Brow, 39, of California, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines planned to disclose their latest findings publicly
today and possibly to announce plans to use two of the remaining
MV-22 Osprey aircraft to simulate some circumstances of the April 8
incident.
</P>
<P>
   The tilt-rotor Osprey takes off and lands like a helicopter but
flies like an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Corps officials who discussed the matter Monday on
condition of anonymity stressed that the investigation is
incomplete. Families of the victims have been informed of the
investigation's progress.
</P>
<P>
   One Pentagon official said investigators are about 90 percent
certain that the crash at a small airport north of Tucson, Ariz.,
was caused by an aerodynamic phenomenon known as ''settling with
power.''
</P>
<P>
   This condition, also known as ''vortex ring state,'' occurs when
a helicopter settles into the wash produced by its own rotor
system. This can happen in circumstances combining a rapid rate of
descent, low forward airspeed and a nearly vertical descent. The
aircraft's descent is so rapid that the flow of air at the inner
portion of the rotor blades is upward rather than downward. The
upward flow of air caused by the aircraft's descent can reach a
level that is greater than the downward flow produced by blade
rotation. At this point the aircraft can sink uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Osprey, the rotors may have been using such a
large proportion of available engine power that the aircraft had
insufficient power left to slow the rate at which it was sinking in
its rotor wash.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what caused the Osprey to get into the
''settling with power'' problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported Monday that the Osprey probably
pitched over as it began sinking, then flew almost straight down
into the ground. Citing unidentified sources, the Post also
reported that investigators are examining the extent to which the
Osprey's fuel tanks were ruptured in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have accumulated evidence from a combination of
sources, including interviews with members of the crew of an MV-22
Osprey that landed at the same airport just moments before the
crash. A member of that crew reported seeing the Osprey nose-dive
into the ground as he looked behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also have gleaned details from the Osprey's flight
data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the deadliest air disaster for the Marines since
22 died in a helicopter crash in South Korea in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Senate Eyes Colombia, Kosovo Funds  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republican leaders are ready to begin
pushing a pared-down, $7.2 billion package financing anti-drug
efforts in Colombia, peacekeeping in Kosovo and aid to victims of
natural disasters at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee was to approve the so-called
emergency money today, more than a month after Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., backed by conservatives, blocked work
on a larger version. Lott supports the smaller proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The new package, written by committee Chairman Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, is less than the $13 billion bill the House approved
March 30 but more than the $5.2 billion President Clinton initially
requested. It was described by Senate aides on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a freestanding bill, the money will be divided among
three routine spending bills for military construction, foreign aid
and agriculture for the coming fiscal year that the committee plans
to vote on.
</P>
<P>
   By trimming the emergency funds and attaching them to must-pass
spending bills, Stevens was addressing Lott's objections that a
separate package would have been too expensive and time-consuming.
Lott and other GOP leaders want Congress to adjourn as early as
possible this election year so lawmakers can return home and
campaign for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Since stalling the earlier measure, Lott has come under pressure
from administration officials and others who argue the money is
needed urgently, especially aid to Colombia's embattled government
for fighting drug traffickers who control large swaths of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The new package contains $5.7 billion for U.S. peacekeeping in
Kosovo, anti-drug efforts in Colombia and other Defense Department
programs. Included was money for Pentagon fuel purchases and the
military's financially ailing health-insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   Another $1.5 billion was for the aftermath of last fall's
Hurricane Floyd, which battered parts of the East Coast, and other
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate breakdown available of the money for
Colombia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton requested $1.3 billion for Colombia, on top of $300
million already provided, while the House approved $1.7 billion.
Clinton requested about $2.8 billion for Kosovo and other Pentagon
needs, while the House approved $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also sought $1 billion for disasters, while the House
provided $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill included $4 billion lawmakers added for the
Defense Department to upgrade weapons and other expenditures.
Stevens' measure excluded that money, which GOP leaders plan to
include in the Pentagon's regular 2001 spending bill to be written
in coming weeks.

March 30 but more than the $5.2 billion President Clinton initially
requested. It was described by Senate aides on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a freestanding bill, the money will be divided among
three routine spending bills for military construction, foreign aid
and agriculture for the coming fiscal year that the committee plans
to vote on.
</P>
<P>
   By trimming the emergency funds and attaching them to must-pass
spending bills, Stevens was addressing Lott's objections that a
separate package would have been too expensive and time-consuming.
Lott and other GOP leaders want Congress to adjourn as early as
possible this election year so lawmakers can return home and
campaign for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Since stalling the earlier measure, Lott has come under pressure
from administration officials and others who argue the money is
needed urgently, especially aid to Colombia's embattled government
for fighting drug traffickers who control large swaths of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The new package contains $5.7 billion for U.S. peacekeeping in
Kosovo, anti-drug efforts in Colombia and other Defense Department
programs. Included was money for Pentagon fuel purchases and the
military's financially ailing health-insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   Another $1.5 billion was for the aftermath of last fall's
Hurricane Floyd, which battered parts of the East Coast, and other
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate breakdown available of the money for
Colombia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton requested $1.3 billion for Colombia, on top of $300
million already provided, while the House approved $1.7 billion.
Clinton requested about $2.8 billion for Kosovo and other Pentagon
needs, while the House approved $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also sought $1 billion for disasters, while the House
provided $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill included $4 billion lawmakers added for the
Defense Department to upgrade weapons and other expenditures.
Stevens' measure excluded that money, which GOP leaders plan to
include in the Pentagon's regular 2001 spending bill to be written
in coming weeks.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Support Land Buyback Plan  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an election year and with billions of
dollars in the offing, lawmakers are rushing to support legislation
that calls for creating a $3 billion annual conservation fund for
land purchases, wildlife protection and restoration of coastal
beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The massive land conservation measure, which is expected to pass
the House when it comes up for a vote, probably Wednesday, would
earmark nearly $45 billion over 15 years for a myriad of projects
from wetlands restoration and endangered species protection to
buying parkland and building ballparks in suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the money would be used to deal with coastal
environmental problems such as beach erosion and mitigating losses
and environmental damage from offshore oil drilling. Louisiana,
California, Florida, Texas and Alaska would benefit significantly.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation ''makes a permanent commitment'' by the
government to provide conservation funding promised long ago, said
Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., one of the bill's architects.
Already, 314 of the 435 House members have signed on as
co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure has some Republican conservatives, mainly from
the intermountain West, steaming over property rights.
</P>
<P>
   It amounts to ''a blank check'' to take private property, Rep.
Helen Chenoweth-Hage, R-Idaho, complained Monday at a news
conference. ''If this bill passes it will become the death knell to
the Republican majority. Our grass roots will become discouraged
(over) ... the impact it will have on private ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   What has incensed property rights advocates most is that one of
their own, Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, a leading champion of property
rights, is among the most vocal cheerleaders -- and one of the
principal co-sponsors -- for the House bill.
</P>
<P>
   Young calls the concerns about property rights ''utterly
ridiculous'' and maintains the bill specifically protects
landowners from having to give up their land.
</P>
<P>
   But even the critics acknowledge House approval is virtually
assured as lawmakers find it hard to oppose a bill that will funnel
billions of federal dollars to their states while letting them show
support for the environment during an election year. The Clinton
administration -- which announced its own, more modest $1.4 billion
''land legacy'' initiative last year -- supports the bill, although
would like some changes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's projected annual spending programs include:
</P>
<P>
   --$1 billion for coastal ecosystems, restoring wetlands and
eroded beaches and repairing damage caused by offshore oil
drilling. Distribution is pegged to miles of coastline and amount
of oil production.
</P>
<P>
   --$900 million for conservation-related federal and state land
purchases, three times what is spent on such purchases today, and
$125 million in matching grants for urban parks and recreational
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   --$350 million for wildlife conservation and hunting programs.
</P>
<P>
   --$150 million for conservation easements and landowner
incentives to protect endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   --$100 million to protect historic sites and $200 million for
Indian lands restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The money would come from the $4 billion to $5 billion the
federal government collects annually from government oil leases,
especially drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's prospects in the Senate, where one or two senators
can stall legislation, remains unclear. The legislation is to get
its first Senate test next month in a committee vote. Sen. Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska, whose Energy and Natural Resources Committee
will consider the measure he is co-sponsoring, said, ''We still
have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators involved in budget and appropriations matters are
worried about the bill's cost, and a group of Western senators --
from states where the federal government already owns huge amounts
of land -- fear a new federal assault on private property, Murkowski
said.
</P>
<P>
   Young argues, the annual fund ''will guide our nation's
conservation, recreation and wildlife program for decades to
come.'' The legislation specifically prohibits the taking of land
without consent, he says. Critics argue that provision applies to
only a fraction of the money linked to direct federal land
purchases -- not state or local action.
</P>
<P>
   Current distribution plans would make coastal states with
offshore oil drilling the biggest winners: Alaska, $163 million;
California, $324 million; Louisiana, $311 million; Texas, $236
million; Alaska, $163 million; Florida, $141 million. But every
state would get some money, even landlocked Vermont, $8.9 million,
and Kansas, $13.5 million.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Albright: Clinton Open About Putin  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton will go to Moscow in June with
an open mind on missile defenses and determined not to set off
another nuclear arms race, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
says.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is responsible for protecting the United States from new
missile threats and will weigh a missile defense along with
''whatever other means there are to protect the territory of this
country,'' Albright said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has not made the decision to deploy'' and he
will not be pressured by ''artificial deadlines,'' Albright told
publishers at the annual meeting of The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to
declare his opposition to even the limited missile defense Clinton
is considering. Albright said arms control would be on the agenda,
along with Russia's economic program and its campaign against
secessionists in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know each other,'' Albright said, recalling Clinton and
Putin had met twice before. ''They don't need to get acquainted.
They are going to be working on a comprehensive agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranging over foreign policy issues, and security lapses at the
State Department, Albright described herself and all employees as
''humiliated'' that three laptop computers, one of them used for
classified material, had vanished and that a listening device was
discovered implanted in a conference room.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think many of you will probably understand the difficulties
of control in this technological era,'' she said. ''But we are
really putting the clamps down.''
</P>
<P>
   On Bosnia, Albright confessed error by the administration in
saying initially that U.S. peacekeeping troops would be able to go
home in a year's time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are now looking for a variety of benchmarks in the
establishment of this civil society there in order to be able to
make the decision to leave,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Albright offered no new date for the departure of the
U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   In weighing a missile defense program, one that would use 100
launchers and new radar to defend against what Albright said is a
threat from North Korea and Iran, Clinton faces criticism on all
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, has vowed to block any new arms control
agreement, saying that Clinton, with eight months left in office,
should not be hemming in his successor.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the likely Republican presidential candidate,
and some other conservative Republicans favor a heftier and more
costly missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than try to persuade Putin to amend the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which prohibits national defenses
against missiles, many would simply junk the accord.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the
European Unions' chief foreign policy official, Javier Solana, and
several allied governments question the wisdom of even a limited
missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a national decision with very strong international
impact, not only for Germany but also for Europe,'' German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer said Monday in Washington on meeting with
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   She told the publishers here at a luncheon that Clinton would
weigh potential threats as well as the merits of the technology and
costs in deciding later in the year whether to go ahead with an
anti-missile program.
</P>
<P>
   And, she said, Clinton will consider a fourth criterion: ''What
it actually does to arms control -- how it affects various arms
control regimes.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Gunned Down at S. Leone Rally  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- British troops moved to secure
Freetown's airport for the possible evacuation of its citizens
following clashes in the capital that left four dead. The country's
notorious rebel leader also disappeared from his U.N. guard,
prompting fears of more unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations late Monday began evacuating some of its 266
nonessential civilian employees. Another 55 were staying in
Freetown, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official, meanwhile, told the United
Nations that the U.S. Air Force was prepared to fly a battalion of
U.N. peacekeepers from Bangladesh -- roughly 700 to 800 soldiers --
in coming days. The United Nations wants to speed up deployment of
that battalion and two others scheduled to arrive by mid-July,
bringing the U.N. force up to its full strength of 11,100.
</P>
<P>
   Following the shootings in Freetown, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
described Sierra Leone's peace process as being in ''deep
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All we can do is hope that this isn't the beginning of the
return to civil war,'' he said in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of British citizens and other foreign nationals poured
into one of the city's two main hotels, clutching passports and
suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   A Sierra Leonean woman who said rebels had killed her husband
and four of their children last year waited in a hotel courtyard
with her 9-year-old daughter -- a British citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to lose her, too,'' she said, holding her
daughter's shoulder as she waited to send the girl away to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone, among the world's least developed countries, was
brutalized during eight years of civil war, which ended with a
peace accord last July that created a power-sharing government. In
principle, that deal included the rebel Revolutionary United Front
and its leader, Foday Sankoh, whose forces killed and maimed
thousands during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The preparations for a mass exodus of foreigners follow chaos
that broke out Monday in front of Sankoh's house. At least 5,000
marchers rallying for an end to hostilities overwhelmed U.N. troops
guarding the house, throwing rocks and singing a song with lyrics
calling for Sankoh to be beheaded and castrated.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel fighters, standing behind the U.N. troops, fired through
the U.N. ranks, spraying the crowd with automatic weapons and
rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
   People began to flee in panic, and dozens were wounded in the
shooting and subsequent stampede.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, soldiers from all the country's factions cruised the
streets of this West African coastal city, pointing machine guns
from their vehicle windows.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio broadcast late Monday, Sierra Leone's president,
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, deplored the violence and called on all armed
forces to leave the streets and return to their bases.
</P>
<P>
   He also admitted that Sankoh could not be located. ''An
investigation is now being undertaken to determine where he is,''
Kabbah said.
</P>
<P>
   Corinna Schuler, a Johannesburg, South Africa,-based journalist
for The Christian Science Monitor, said she took shelter in a small
building at Sankoh's compound during the stampede. Two Sierra
Leoneans who joined her were killed when rebels discovered them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will let you go because you are a journalist,'' the soldier
told her. ''I want you to tell those boys, they must never come to
protest at Foday Sankoh's house again.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan renewed his call for a
well-equipped rapid reaction force, but there appeared to be little
appetite for such intervention among Western countries.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative to U.S. troops, the United States approached
Nigeria on Monday about possibly sending in a force. The Nigerians
were being approached because of delays in deploying the three
remaining battalions of U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Sierra Leone has become increasingly chaotic
since a regional force pulled out last week.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. and rebel officials tried Sunday to assure residents that
the situation had calmed, despite a battle between their own forces
Saturday and 500 peacekeepers being held hostage by the RUF. At
least one peacekeeper is believed to be dead.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of British troops were in Freetown to prepare for
the possible evacuation of its citizens, although British Defense
Secretary Geoff Hoon did not rule out supporting U.N. peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 15, Dodgers 7  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona manager Buck Showalter got his 500th
career win as the Travis Lee and Andy Fox each had four RBIs Monday
night to lead the Diamondbacks to a 15-7 rout of the Los Angeles
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, which won its fifth straight, scored five runs each in
the first, fourth and fifth innings, and had 20 hits, tying the
team's high for a nine-inning game.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, who started play in 1998, set a season high
for runs and at 22-10 surpassed Atlanta (21-10) for best record in
the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley and Fox hit two-run homers in the fifth inning, and
Tony Womack hit a solo homer in the fourth. Finley's was his 12th,
leaving him tied with Chicago's Sammy Sosa for the NL lead.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was 4-for-5, hitting RBI singles in the first and fourth,
and Lee was 3-for-4 with a two-run single in the first and a
two-run double in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter, who began his managerial career with the New York
Yankees, improved his career record to 500-437.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Daal (1-3) won despite allowing six runs and six hits in
seven innings, allowing two-run homers by Adrian Beltre and Todd
Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Ho Park (3-3) was pounded for eight runs and nine hits in 3
1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Matt Herges, who had not allowed an earned run in 19
1-3 innings over 12 relief appearances this year, gave up seven
runs in 1 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona took a 5-0 lead in the first on an RBI groundout by Luis
Gonzalez, Lee's two-run single and RBI singles by Fox and Daal.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's homer in the fourth closed the gap to 5-4, but the
Diamondbacks then scored 10 unanswered runs before Beltre drove in
a run with a sixth-inning groundout.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Fox had four RBIs and four hits for the second time in his
career. He drove in four runs at St. Louis last July 4, and his
first four-hit game against Chicago on July 28, 1998. ... Daal has
given up seven homers in his last three starts. ... Erubiel Durazo
went 0-for-4 after two walks, ending his 10-game hitting streak.
... Arizona closer Matt Mantei, on the disabled list for the second
time to build up muscle in his right shoulder, threw about 30
pitches before the game.

<HEADLINE> Charges To Be Filed Against Chmura  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAUKESHA, Wis. (AP) -- Charges will be filed next week in a
sexual assault case involving Green Bay Packers tight end Mark
Chmura.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Bucher said Monday that he received
preliminary test results from the state crime laboratory, and
charges would be filed next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're plowing ahead,'' he said. ''We're going to file
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucher said that the type and number of the charges ''and
against whom will be announced on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, 31, and a friend, Robert J. Gessert, 43, were arrested
April 10 by Hartland police. Chmura is accused of having sexual
intercourse with a 17-year-old girl at a post-prom party at
Gessert's house on April 9, while Gessert is accused of sexual
contact with an 18-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   Bucher said in court April 10 that both men could be charged
with third-degree sexual assault, a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were also focusing on two potential drinking-related
citations: for allowing or failing to prevent underage drinking on
one's premises, and for procuring, selling or dispensing alcohol to
minors.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Boyle, Chmura's attorney, said Monday that Chmura's
version of what happened was different from that of the 17-year-old
girl.
</P>
<P>
   ''When all is said and done, I think the picture is going to be
much different than what people think,'' Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Bucher and Boyle said they planned to meet this week before
Bucher makes his final decision on charges for Monday's previously
scheduled court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle said Bucher had not informed him of the results of the lab
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura's future with the Packers is in doubt. Packers coach Mike
Sherman recently said he was taking a ''wait-and-see attitude'' on
whether Chmura would be invited to the team's mini-camp which
starts May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura did not attend the Packers' mini-camp April 28-30 after
Sherman suggested Chmura should spend time with his family.

<HEADLINE> Jazz, Blazers Set for Game 2  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Utah Jazz have been running the same
old plays -- John Stockton to Karl Malone and back again -- for
nearly 15 years, and they're not about to shake things up after one
lopsided loss to the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just need to play our basketball, do the things we do to
make us good,'' Stockton said Monday as the Jazz prepared for
tonight's Game 2. ''To go and try to change that right now doesn't
make any sense. We know we have a good team. We have to play a
certain way to be good, and if we don't do that, we're awfully
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah certainly was that during the fourth quarter of Game 1
Sunday, when the Jazz missed nine of their first 10 shots and were
outscored 29-14 on the way to a 94-75 loss. Whether the short
recovery time after the first round was to blame, or it was
Portland's strong defense late in the game, the Jazz looked nothing
like the proud team that made the conference finals five times
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt like they were going to come out and deliver the first
blow and play with a lot of energy and intensity,'' Portland's
Scottie Pippen said before practice Monday. ''But they were not the
same team. ... We can expect a totally different team to come out
(tonight).''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers know that a loss tonight would cost them homecourt
advantage in the best-of-seven Western Conference semifinals and
make their 19-point Game 1 rout irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Game 2 is always the most important game for the home team,''
Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said. ''It's the one you have the
biggest chance of slipping up in, the best chance of a letdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz coach Jerry Sloan knows his team is outmatched, however.
Utah has lost four straight to Portland this season and hasn't won
on the Blazers' home court in 13 tries.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is who we are,'' Sloan lamented. ''I'd like to say we're
a different team. I'd like to say, 'Well, all of a sudden Michael
Jordan is going to show up and play for us,' but that isn't the way
it works. We just have to go with who we are and see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen had another strong playoff performance, scoring 20 points
and exploiting a mismatch against Jazz guard Jeff Hornacek. The
6-foot-8 Pippen scored 13 points in the second half, most of them
while he was being defended by the 6-4 Hornacek.
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek, who also had trouble guarding Steve Smith in the high
post, said he expects to stay on Pippen. But Sloan criticized his
team for standing around and not helping Hornacek.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody in America knew that they were going to post
us up, except four other guys watching,'' Sloan said. ''Yeah, they
made some shots, but their offensive rebounds kill you too. When
you stand and watch and then you don't rebound, what are you
supposed to do? Start switching players around? No, I don't do
that. Hornacek's a pretty good player. I have no less confidence in
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, the only Utah starter who consistently worked hard and
contributed, is expected to play despite straining a ligament in
his left knee on a freak play late in the second quarter Sunday.
Malone was on the bench when teammate Armen Gilliam dived for a
ball and hit Malone's chair, causing him to twist his knee.
</P>
<P>
   Malone came out strong in the third quarter, scoring 12 points
to keep the Jazz in it until they wilted in the fourth. He finished
with 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   Malone skipped Monday's practice, which amounted to little more
than shooting around. His no-show might have had less to do with
his knee than his annoyance at the media. Malone, who lost to
Jordan's and Pippen's Chicago Bulls twice in the NBA Finals, cursed
and cut an interview short after a reporter asked about Pippen's
dominance in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's fine,'' Hornacek said of Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know Karl will be there,'' Stockton said. ''If his
leg's broken, we know he'll be there and play well, and you can't
really stop and think about it. That's the way it is; just go
play.''

   HOUSTON (AP) -- Jose Lima, looking nothing like the pitcher who
won 21 games last season for the Houston Astros, will get extra
time to prepare for his next outing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to skip Lima's next start,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we'll pitch him Tuesday in Milwaukee. We have an
off-day and this will give him a chance to have two or three
bullpen sessions so he can try to get his problems ironed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima is 1-5 with a 9.53 ERA in seven starts. He has allowed a
major league-leading 16 home runs in only 39 2-3 innings, along
with 65 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Lima got a no-decision Sunday night in Los Angeles despite
another shaky outing. The All-Star righty was charged with seven
runs -- four earned -- and six hits in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lima was 21-10 with a 3.58 ERA for the NL Central
champions. Now, he's lost five straight decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Lima's next start was supposed to come at home against
Cincinnati this weekend. He has struggled at new Enron Field, which
has been a homer haven so far.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not that far off,'' Dierker said. ''He's just throwing
too many fat pitches. His velocity is good. We just want him to
work on a few things.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima wants to pitch himself out of the slump, but he accepts the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to pitch, but I understand,'' he said after learning of
the move Monday night. ''No one is more frustrated by this than me.
I want to get it turned around and hopefully, this will help me.
I'd rather keep pitching, but I understand.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates are rooting for him. They are concerned about
their animated pitcher, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jose will come to the park today and he'll be on the top step
of the dugout,'' third baseman Ken Caminiti said. ''With his antics
on the mound, you have to back it up. All the other teams are
digging in against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti repeated a theme that has recurred in analyzing Lima's
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jose needs to pitch with his head and not his heart,''
Caminiti said. ''That's the way he is, but he has to learn to
control it.''

<HEADLINE> US Reclimbing World's Hockey Ladder  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- Two years ago, the United States
left the World Hockey Championships humbled and humiliated, on the
brink of relegation to sport's international 'B' pool.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Americans are headed for the quarterfinals, unbeaten in
the tournament with stunning wins over the NHL-stacked host Russian
team and the heavily favored Swedes, champions in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While the Americans have modest goals, they might find
themselves in the medals round if they manage to beat their
quarterfinal opponent, yet to be determined with second-round play
still in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal this year was not to go down, to be eliminated,''
said American coach Lou Vairo, who worked behind the U.S. bench at
the 1984 Olympic Games in Sarajevo. ''Our second goal was to
qualify for the quarterfinals, and now we've done that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we have to win our game Thursday or we go home. But we
might be able to advance to the medal round.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to this year's success appears to be Vairo's laid-back
approach, allowing the players to just play.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tell them to handle the puck, play and have fun, enjoy
themselves,'' Vairo explained. ''We don't yell, we don't punish, we
don't bench people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here to represent our country. The players give us their
commitment and full heart. We don't ask them to win a game, just
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who have won the championships just twice since
they began in 1920 -- the last time in 1960 -- finished a mediocre
sixth last year after the NHL's top stars turned down an invitation
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Again this year, with few exceptions, the United States' best
players skipped the annual championship in Europe or couldn't make
it because their teams were still locked into the Stanley Cup
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Americans ended up with 13 NHL grinders, and
filled out the rest of the lineup with minor league, college and
European league players.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary Flames veteran Phil Housley, the NHL's all-time American
scoring leader, has been the team's anchor, while four members from
last year's team have made the return trip: Vancouver forward Darby
Hendrickson, who is making his fifth appearance at the worlds;
Nashville forward David Legwand; Montreal defenseman Eric Weinrich;
and Boston College defenseman Mike Mottau.
</P>
<P>
   These championships represent a chance to restore the United
States' position as a world hockey power. The Americans have done
little to maintain their image since their stunning victory over
Canada in the final of the inaugural World Cup of Hockey in
Montreal in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   With virtually an identical team to '96 at the Nagano Games, the
United States failed to even medal, and sullied its image by
trashing rooms in the Olympic Village following its quarterfinal
elimination by the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, no Olympians went to Switzerland for the
world championships. The players who did go suffered a string of
embarrassments, including a humiliating 4-0 loss to Italy, a team
with no National Hockey Leaguers, and a historical 3-1 round-robin
defeat to France, coached by Herb Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the relegation round, the United States was forced to
compete in a last-chance tournament the following autumn in order
to claw its way back into the 'A' pool.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have two wonderful assistant coaches and I have great
players,'' said Vairo. ''I tell them everyday 'you guys are great.
I love you.'''

Ex-Presidents Back China Trade Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With just a few weeks before a vote, President Clinton has
invited two former presidents and top officials from past administrations to the
White House to help him twist the arms of congressmen who remain undecided about
granting permanent normal trade relations to China. Presidents Ford and Carter
were to join Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in the East Room Tuesday to
rally support for the landmark trade legislation, which would ease the Asian
nation's entrance into the World Trade Organization. Former secretaries of
state, including Henry Kissinger, and past national security advisers also were
to stand with the president.

   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Despite lingering differences over tax cuts and campaign

rival George W. Bush following their first face-to-face meeting since a bitter
primary campaign. The Arizona senator decided against making a more climactic
announcement near this summer's Republican National Convention after tiring of

Bush's campaign's attempts to manage the meeting and spin its outcome in the

U.S. Seeks To Ban Roads in Forest

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration on Tuesday will call for
banning road construction in 43 million acres of roadless federal forests and
propose allowing local foresters to decide whether to bar activities such as
logging, mining and off-road-vehicle use. The plan defers a decision on whether
to prohibit roads in 8.7 million acres of the nation's largest forest, the
Tongass in Alaska, until 2004 when agency officials review a separate plan
governing that forest. Leaving out the Tongass ''just leaves a gaping hole in
this policy,'' said the campaign manager of the Alaska Rainforest Campaign.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Expect Desperate Penguins  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- It's Game 6, and the Pittsburgh Penguins are
in big trouble. They trail the series 3-2, and Jaromir Jagr is
hurting and might not play.
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar scenario to the Penguins, who found themselves
in this same predicament a year ago and escaped. Whether they do so
tonight depends greatly on Jagr, who has a leg injury -- and, of
course, the Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago tonight, the Penguins seemed headed for their first
playoff series victory over the Flyers, leading the Eastern
Conference semifinals 2-0 after winning twice on the road.
</P>
<P>
   But three games, three losses and an injured Jagr later, the
Penguins are one loss away from elimination.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers also find themselves one game away from the Eastern
Conference finals against the Devils, largely because of the
momentum they generated by winning twice in overtime last week in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we learned our lesson in the first two games,'' said
Flyers rookie defenseman Andy Delmore, who has five goals in the
series -- as many as Jagr. ''I don't believe there's overconfidence
in this locker room. We know that Pittsburgh has the great
firepower.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Penguins don't have nearly as much without Jagr.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr had five goals in the first three games but, after
dominating Game 3 with two goals and an assist, was clearly off his
game in the Flyers' 2-1, five-overtime victory in Game 4. He lacked
his normal breakaway speed and had few good scoring chances despite
playing nearly 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr barely played because of an injured leg in the Flyers' 6-3
victory Sunday in Game 5, and didn't practice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the NHL's leading scorer in the playoffs and the
regular season estimated his chances of playing tonight as 90
percent. But there were mixed signals Monday from his teammates
concerning his availability.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr missed nearly a month of the regular season with thigh and
hamstring injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''As well as he has played, it would be natural to say, 'Oh, my,
what are we going to do if he can't play?' '' forward Robert Lang
said. ''But it's not a big deal. We've got to go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins have rallied from 3-2 deficits to win a series four
times since 1991, with the most recent comeback occurring last year
against New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Jagr unexpectedly came off the bench despite a thigh
injury to score the tying and winning goals as the Penguins rallied
to beat top-seeded New Jersey in Game 6. The Penguins then ousted
the Devils in Game 7 in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we can't rely on Jaromir Jagr to win the game for us,''
defenseman Darius Kasparaitis said. ''I hope history is on our side
again, but you can't look at it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Flyers will go into the game expecting the worst:
Jagr in uniform and the Penguins desperate to keep the series, and
their season, going.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect he'll come out playing,'' coach Craig Ramsay said.
''He's a great competitor. Everyone's seen him over the years come
up with big games at big times. We expect the best from Jaromir
Jagr.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Flyers forward Rick Tocchet, a one-time Jagr teammate in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''Knowing him, he'll throw his A-plus game at us,'' Tocchet
said. ''I think he was disappointed in the overtime game and
Sunday's game. He's a little frustrated, but he'll get his 48 hours
of rest and give it all he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Flyers already know they can win in Pittsburgh -- their
two overtime victories gave them control of the series -- they seem
especially eager to avoid a Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to play equally desperate to get it over with because
we definitely don't want to come back for Game 7,'' rookie
goaltender Brian Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   If Jagr can't play, the Penguins need production from several
forwards who haven't been very effective in the series -- namely
Josef Beranek and Rene Corbet -- or a goal or two from Alexei
Kovalev, who has only one goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect to win the games here and losing hurt us a lot,
especially the two overtime games,'' defenseman Darius Kasparaitis
said. ''But I think it's time our luck turned around for us.''

Tuesday, May 9:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philadelphia at Pittsburgh (7 p.m. EDT). The Flyers, leading
3-2, seek to complete their comeback from an 0-2 deficit in their
Eastern Conference semifinal series.
STAR:
Monday:
</P>
<P>
   -- Petr Sykora, Devils, scored 18 seconds after the opening
faceoff in New Jersey's 3-0 series-clinching win over Toronto.
SHOTS:
</P>
<P>
   According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Toronto's six shots on
goal in Monday night's 3-0 series-ending loss to New Jersey were
the fewest shots in any NHL game since the start of the expansion
era in 1967.
SIGNINGS:
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus Blue Jackets, who start play in the 2000-01 season,
signed free-agent forwards Jonathan Schill and Mathieu Darche on
Monday, bringing the number of players under contract with the NHL
expansion team to three. The team signed Niagara University goalie
Greg Gardner last week.
SLUMP:
</P>
<P>
   When the Toronto Maple Leafs lost 3-0 to New Jersey on Monday
night, it guaranteed that they would not win the NHL championship
for the 33rd straight year. Toronto has only reached the conference
finals four times since its 1967 Stanley Cup title, including last
year's loss to Buffalo.
STAYING IN THE STATES:
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's elimination from the playoffs assures that the Stanley
Cup will be won by a franchise from the United States for a record
seventh straight season, following Montreal's victory in 1993. The
only other time U.S. teams won the Cup six years in a row was from
1936-41.
SIDELINED:
</P>
<P>
   Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Alexander Karpovtsev, who missed
the final two periods of Game 5 after being slashed in the ribs,
did not play Monday night in the season-ending 3-0 loss against New
Jersey. Karpovtsev was injured Saturday night when Devils forward
Claude Lemieux slashed him in the ribs from behind. The injury led
to a rapid heartbeat and forced Karpovtsev to sit out the rest of
the game. Karpovtsev was taken to a hospital for precautionary
reasons and was back at Air Canada Centre following the game.
SOUR FEELINGS:
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Penguins remained angry Monday at Philadelphia
defenseman Luke Richardson for shooting a puck directly into
defenseman Bob Boughner's chest, with Boughner promising to get
back at Richardson. Richardson teed up a slap shot from the red
line and fired it into Boughner's chest during the second period of
the Flyers' 6-3 victory Sunday. The Penguins felt Richardson's shot
was a deliberate intent to injure. Richardson drew a two-minute
penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.
SPEAKING:
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't shoot the puck. It is an ongoing problem for our
hockey club. They want to see the back of the net before ... when
you play a good defensive club, they take care of the play.'' --
Toronto coach Pat Quinn after his team's NHL record-low six shots
in a season-ending 3-0 loss to New Jersey on Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Angels 9, Athletics 8  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Brothers Jason and Jeremy Giambi homered
for Oakland, but the Anaheim Angels rallied from five runs back
Monday night to beat the Athletics 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn homered twice and drove in five runs for the Angels,
Troy Glaus went 4-for-4, and Benjie Molina provided the go-ahead
run with a sacrifice fly in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Giambis became the first brothers to homer in the same game
since last Oct. 2 when Vladimir and Wilton Guerrero connected for
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's second homer, a three-run shot off reliever Luis
Vizcaino in the sixth inning, evened it at 8. The Angels fell
behind 8-3 in the top of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi hit a two-run homer, his major league-leading 14th,
in the second inning, then Jeremy hit a three-run shot in the
fourth, his second of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Both homers came off Ramon Ortiz. Jason's sailed 430 feet into
the right-field seats, and Jeremy's liner cleared the fence in
right-center and was measured at 405 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Jason, 29, and Jeremy, 25, joined a rare group of brothers to
homer in the same game. Among the others to do it are Hank and
Tommie Aaron, Cal and Billy Ripken, and Billy and Tony Conigliaro.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Long also had a three-run homer, his fourth, off Ortiz
to cap a six-run fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics' Ariel Prieto, making his first major league
appearance since undergoing reconstructive surgery on his right
elbow in 1998, gave up five runs on 11 hits in four-plus innings
and left with Oakland ahead 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   T.J. Mathews (1-2) gave up the Angels' ninth run, which Glaus
scored after doubling with one out and advancing on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petkovsek (2-1) allowed one hit over 1 1-3 innings. Troy
Percival pitched the ninth for his ninth save.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz was rocked for eight runs, seven earned, on six hits in 3
2-3 innings. He walked three and struck out three.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics have scored 62 runs over their last six games but
have allowed 56 and lost four times -- blowing leads of four, eight,
five and five runs.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn hit a leadoff homer against Prieto in the fifth after
having an RBI double in the first. Adam Kennedy had three hits for
the Angels, and Gary DiSarcina had two, including a two-run double
in the second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Other brothers to homer in the same game were Paul and
Lloyd Waner, Graig and Jim Nettles, Rick and Wes Ferrell, Al and
Tony Cuccinello, Matty and Jesus Alou, and Aaron and Bret Boone.
The Aarons and the Waners homered in the same game on three
occasions, and Conigliaros, Nettles and Ripkens did it twice. ...
The Giambis have started the same game seven times. ... The
Athletics' most runs ever over a six-game stretch was 68 from June
14-18, 1969. DiSarcina was back at shortstop after being sidelined
since May 2 with a sore shoulder, but he left the game in the sixth
inning. ... Anaheim pitcher Tim Belcher, trying to work his way
back from November elbow surgery, has experienced fatigue in his
arm throwing on the sidelines and will be reevaluated this week.

<HEADLINE> Philly Adopts School Uniform Policy  </HEADLINE>
By TINA MOORE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The nationwide trend of requiring school
uniforms in hopes of subduing student rivalries and boosting grades
has won over its first big-city public school district --
Philadelphia's.
</P>
<P>
   Though the policy adopted Monday doesn't call for the 217,000
students to wear Catholic school-style uniforms, it does require
each school to decide how the youngsters should dress. Schools must
begin that work immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is certainly not the answer to academic achievement or
school climate, but I think it can be one component to establishing
respect for the school,'' said board member Christine James-Brown.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen parents and students spoke out against the policy
during Monday's school board meeting. Some held up a sign that
read, ''School uniforms kill creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to be dealing with kids who cannot read or write,''
said Lisa Haver, who has two children at Central High School.
''People who make suggestions like this are people who don't spend
any time in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Central High senior Adam Greenman said a uniform policy will
just give students another way to get in trouble and predicted
widespread opposition to the dress code.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you implement this policy, students who once were
considered good might now be considered discipline problems,''
Greenman said. ''We were made to be different; we were not made to
be uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, educators grappling with school violence are trying
to bust up cliques and limit adolescent isolation. President
Clinton has endorsed dress-code policies, and the Philadelphia
school board looked into the issue last month at the request of
Mayor John Street.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the National Association of Elementary School
Principals in 1998 found that 52 percent of principals requiring
uniforms reported a boost in student performance.
</P>
<P>
   At John L. Bernstein Public School 137 in New York, students
began wearing crisp, new blue and white uniforms in September.
Parents can write a note excusing their children from wearing
uniforms. Otherwise, Principal May Beyda said, the school would
face multiple lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities have uniform policies -- in Miami, 60 percent of
public schools require uniforms. In Chicago, it's 80 percent. And
in New York City, about half of the public elementary schools have
a uniform policy.
</P>
<P>
   But no city as large as Philadelphia has a districtwide policy.
</P>
<P>
   James-Brown said schools would be pushed to look at clothes that
are inexpensive and readily available. Punishment for failing to
abide by a dress code would probably not be attached to the policy
for the rest of the current school year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline and other particulars, such as provisions for
students who can't wear the uniforms for religious reasons, would
be worked out by a committee of parents, students and educators.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ryan, principal of James Elverson Middle School, believes
uniforms will help cut back on competition among students.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will take their minds off the social aspect of interacting
and put it more on the important facts of learning,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Stefan Presser, legal director of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Pennsylvania, said his organization might challenge
Philadelphia's policy if it were to violate a student's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aside from reading and writing, public schools are supposed to
be teaching democracy,'' Presser said. ''Uniforms are antithetical
to teaching people how to make choices.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Admits To Missteps in S. Leone  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Battered by criticism that it has lost its
credibility in Sierra Leone, the United Nations admits it has
stumbled but blames the chaos on rebels who are flouting the
country's peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The president, ministers and residents in Sierra Leone's
capital, Freetown, have expressed mounting disillusionment with the
U.N. mission -- particularly after it reported and then retracted
news that the rebels were advancing on Freetown over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The faulty report followed a week in which an estimated 500
peacekeepers were taken hostage by rebels and stripped of their
weapons and in some cases their uniforms. It spooked a war-weary
city that had seen a rebel invasion only a year before.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United Nations has let us down,'' Freetown resident Agnes
Johnson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   She said the country was promised that there would be no
security vacuum when the regional intervention force, known as
ECOMOG, withdrew last week. But she said that after it pulled out,
the U.N. mission was not able to offer protection.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan acknowledged the criticism Monday,
saying the botched reporting of the advance on Freetown and other
communications problems with the mission were certainly not helping
the tense situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the proudest moment of the force,'' he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But his spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said the United Nations wasn't
to blame for the spiral of violence by the rebel Revolutionary
United Front that has thrown Sierra Leone's peace process into
disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main thing is this was a peace agreement that everyone put
their signatures to, and that the RUF today is not living by. And
that's the heart of the problem,'' Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard admitted the U.N. force has stumbled. But he said little
more could be expected from a new peacekeeping mission that was
relying on often ill-equipped and ill-trained forces that were then
attacked by rebels during their first days and weeks in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''A number of these units stepped off the plane and within hours
or a few days were immediately moved to the interior of the
country,'' Eckhard said. ''I think there are lots of explanations
you could give for why the peacekeepers were a bit off balance in
their early confrontations with the RUF.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Sierra Leoneans have pointed to the fact that the
peacekeepers have the authority to use force to protect themselves
or civilians but have chosen in many cases not to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are beginning to question whether troops from certain
countries have the resolve and are willing to dirty their hands,''
said Information Minister Julius Spencer. ''We find it difficult to
understand how such a large number of people can be disarmed and
abducted.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials say the U.N. reluctance to fight back may stem
from the experience in Somalia, where an escalation in the military
response -- prompted by the United States -- resulted in the deaths
of scores of soldiers and an eventual U.S. pullout.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, upping the ante didn't work,'' said Jeffrey
Laurenti, executive director for policy studies at the U.N.
Association of the USA, which supports U.S. involvement in the
United Nations. ''Then when you fled, the impact on credibility was
profound.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Seymour Whitaker, senior fellow at the New York-based
Council on Foreign Relations, said the United Nations could emerge
from the embarrassment of the past week only if western countries
choose to reinforce the battered U.N. mission with the troops and
equipment it needs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's salvageable if we've acquired the political will since
Somalia to stick with this sort of operation and do it with some
amount of strategic skill and care and forward planning,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> Marshall Islanders Awarded $341M  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL TIGHE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- In 1947, some 145 people were relocated from
their homes on a Marshall Island atoll so that the U.S. military
could blow it to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned to Enewetak Atoll in 1980, they found that
some of their land had been vaporized by 43 nuclear blasts, while
the rest was pockmarked by explosions or contaminated by radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, a claims tribunal has awarded $341 million
to compensate the survivors and descendants for the lasting damage
to them and their once-lush homeland.
</P>
<P>
   But collecting it may be the hardest part.
</P>
<P>
   The Marshall Islands Nuclear Claims Tribunal was created through
a 1983 agreement in which the United States accepted responsibility
for losses, damages and health problems stemming from its 1946-1958
nuclear testing program in the Marshalls, about 2,500 miles
southwest of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The United States earmarked $150 million for compensation and
for the tribunal to pay claims as it saw fit. After previous
personal injury payments, only about $4.5 million is left.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal last month said the federal government should pay
islanders $199 million for loss of use of Enewetak, $108 million to
clean up and restore it and $34 million for their 33-year exile and
hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ''The claimants have suffered damage beyond that which money can
compensate,'' the three-member tribunal ruled last month. ''While
that which was lost may be priceless, it does not mean it was
without value.''
</P>
<P>
   Enewetak residents said they plan to appeal to Congress next
week for more funding, said Davor Pevec, their Honolulu-based
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress doesn't pay the award, Enewetak's 1,500 residents
said they will sue in the U.S. Court of Claims in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''We in the United States got clear benefits from the testing
program,'' Pevec said. ''The Marshall Islanders? They got burdened
with this residual contamination, with the destruction of their
land, with their forced relocation.''
</P>
<P>
   Enewetak Atoll consists of about 40 islands in the northwestern
corner of the Marshall Islands. From 1946 to 1958, the United
States conducted 67 atmospheric nuclear tests in the Marshalls.
Two-thirds of those tests, including the first hydrogen bomb blast
in 1952, were in Enewetak.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, the people of Enewetak were taken 125 miles southwest
to Ujelang Atoll -- a parched cluster of coral rubble one-fourth the
size of Enewetak -- and told they would be there no more than five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The group ''suffered grave privations, including periods of near
starvation,'' the U.S. Department of Interior wrote in 1976. They
also received little education and poor health care.
</P>
<P>
   Resettlement occurred in 1980 after a three-year cleanup. Some
islands were gone, others were pocked with blast craters a mile
wide and 200 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   Clearcutting and soil removal lowered islands by several feet.
Once-productive fields were now a runway, while a 350-foot wide
concrete dome was built to cover radioactive material.
</P>
<P>
   Both the tribunal and islanders acknowledge the atoll cannot be
restored to what it was 50 years ago. It should, however, be
upgraded for ''full and unrestricted use,'' Pevec said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States itself made that promise and that promise is
an obligation.''

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Fire Lionel Hollins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Lionel Hollins, an assistant
coach since the Vancouver Grizzlies' inaugural season and interim
head coach for the final 60 games this season, was fired Monday.
</P>
<P>
   New owner Michael Heisley had said he wouldn't make any changes
until he got the long-delayed final approval of his $160 million
purchase from the league. That is expected Wednesday, when Heisley
is scheduled to hold a news conference in Vancouver to confirm Dick
Versace as new president of basketball operations, Billy Knight as
general manager and Tony Barone as director of player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   However, Versace called Hollins at his Phoenix-area home to
deliver the news that the entire coaching staff, including
assistants Jim Boylan, Jack Nolan and Lawrence Frank, would not be
rehired.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing that bothers me is that Mr. Heisley said we would
get together and talk and that never happened,'' Hollins said from
his home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do feel like Dick Versace was calling the shots, even though
he said Mr. Heisley wanted him to call, that he wanted to bring in
as many fresh faces as he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Stu Jackson, the Grizzlies' president and general manager since
the team's formation, also is expected to be on his way out. But an
announcement is expected soon, perhaps as early as today, that
Jackson has accepted a position in the NBA office in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins, 46, took over from Brian Hill, who was fired after a
4-18 start when players balked at his rigid, uncommunicative style.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Athlete Wants To Defect  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Cuban Mario Miguel Chaoui smiled widely at the
thought of playing baseball for the Florida Marlins. But he isn't
in any hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ''First thing, I'd like to learn the language, perfect it, later
study and of course ... to play professional baseball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Cuban college baseball player surfaced in Miami
on Monday -- two days after he left his teammates at an airport in
Minnesota -- and said he would apply for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very difficult for me, but I had to do it, because I
felt a bit tired and it was a decision to have liberty, to
reconcile with my family here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban team was scheduled to play an exhibition game today
against the University of St. Thomas team, which traveled to Cuba
last winter. Chaoui had last been seeing getting into a car outside
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport after Cubans arrived
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Espinosa, Chaoui's uncle, had driven to Minneapolis to
persuade his nephew to defect. Chaoui agreed, jumped in the car and
they drove to Chicago to catch a flight to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by his grandmother and uncle Monday, Chaoui spoke to
reporters in the office of sports agent Joe Cubas, who has helped
other Cuban players after they fled the communist country.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, Chaoui will meet with an immigration
lawyer to request political asylum, Cubas said. Chaoui's family
contacted Cubas for advice, but Cubas is not representing the
player.
</P>
<P>
   Chaoui's team, Equipo Caribe, or Team Caribbean, is made up
mostly of students from the University of Havana and some students
from a technical institute in the Cuban capital. His abrupt
departure took teammates by surprise; some labeled him a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dennis Dease, the president of St. Thomas, said school
officials made sure none of the St. Thomas players was harboring
Chaoui.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a Cuban team of college players came to the United
States was in 1987, when a national team played several games in
Minneapolis.

<HEADLINE> Devils 3, Maple Leafs 0  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Eliminating the Toronto Maple Leafs
and getting to the conference finals for the first time since
winning the Stanley Cup in 1995 was as easy as 3-2-1 for the New
Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   That's actually a cumulative 3-2-1, or six, the NHL record-low
number of shots Toronto had against Martin Brodeur on Monday night
as the Devils posted a 3-0 win to clinch their best-of-seven
Eastern Conference semifinal series 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a great effort,'' said Devils defenseman Scott
Stevens, whose play was the biggest reason the Maple Leafs never
got going offensively. ''We didn't give them anything. We didn't
want to give them life. We didn't want to go back to Toronto.''
</P>
<P>
   Any hope the Maple Leafs had of forcing a Game 7 in Toronto on
Wednesday night evaporated in the opening 18 seconds when Petr
Sykora took a kick pass from Patrik Elias and wristed it past
goaltender Curtis Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   That was the only goal the Devils would need as Toronto went
meekly in extending its Stanley Cup drought to 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   The only real scoring chance the Maple Leafs had came 7:35 into
the game when Brodeur swatted away a backhander by Igor Korolev on
Toronto's first shot. The Leafs would add two more shots in the
first period, two in the second and one early in the third, and
that would be it.
</P>
<P>
   The Elias Sports Bureau said the six shots were the fewest
permitted in a regular season or playoff game since the start of
the expansion era in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to shoot, but it's tough to shoot when you're
outside the red line and you have the puck,'' said Maple Leafs
captain Mats Sundin, who did not score in the series. ''We just
didn't create enough chances. We spent pretty much the whole series
in our own end and in the neutral zone.''
</P>
<P>
   While injuries to Yanic Perreault, Bryan Berard and Nik Antropov
hurt the Maple Leafs, New Jersey's defense was outstanding,
possibly the best it has been since winning the Cup in 1995 under
Jacques Lemaire.
</P>
<P>
   The team since then has gone through one disappointment after
another, missing the playoffs in 1996 and then being eliminated
early the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a long time,'' Brodeur said after picking up his
second shutout of the series and eighth in his playoff career.
''We've had a lot of disappointments in the past. We're kind of
turning the page. Winning the first round was not enough. We're
there and we're tasting it. Hopefully, we'll keep going the same
way.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey will play the winner of the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh
series which Philadelphia leads 3-2 with Game 6 at Pittsburgh
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a big step for us, but we have a lot of work ahead of
us,'' Stevens said. ''It was a great accomplishment after our past
history of having trouble in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took command of the game 25 seconds into the second
period when defenseman Ken Daneyko and Sykora set up Jason Arnott
in front for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie John Madden closed out the scoring with an empty net goal
with six seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's previous playoff low for shots was 13 in a 3-0 loss to
Philadelphia on April 15, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't shoot the puck,'' Leafs coach Pat Quinn said. ''It
is an ongoing problem for our hockey club.''
</P>
<P>
   Maple Leafs forward Garry Valk said the shots total wasn't
right.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we probably ended up with 13 or 14,'' he said. ''They
always do that in this rink. They don't count as many as they have
so it looks like you're not in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' old record for fewest shots allowed was 13 in a 4-2
loss to Pittsburgh last year.
</P>
<P>
   Devils coach Larry Robinson tried not to look at the shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like watching water boil,'' he said. ''You keep watching
it and it's not going to boil. I think there were three minutes
left and I looked up and thought it was 16. I said it can't be six,
but I looked up again and it was six. That's quite an
accomplishment.''

<HEADLINE> Korean Students Intrude US Embassy  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Three leftist students, shouting
''Yankee go home,'' jumped the wall of the U.S. Embassy in central
Seoul today but were soon arrested, South Korean police said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost simultaneously, 19 other students were also arrested
outside the embassy for staging an anti-U.S. demonstration, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police indicated that they would file formal charges against
them.
</P>
<P>
   The three students, assisted by three others, scaled the front
wall of the embassy and scattered dozens of leaflets demanding an
end to the U.S. military presence in South Korea, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said one student tossed leaflets from the top the
stone wall, while two others ran around the embassy compound,
shouting ''Yankee go home.''
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen South Korean police entered the embassy compound
and hauled away the protesters in 10 minutes, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the students came close to the main embassy building
which was guarded by U.S. marines, they said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare trespassing of the U.S. facility by South Korean
activists. The embassy is heavily guarded by South Korean police,
and anti-U.S. student activism has little public support.
</P>
<P>
   In the leaflets, the students, identifying themselves as members
of the ''anti-U.S. youth salvation group,'' alleged that the United
States rules South Korea as a colony.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States must stop its interference policy and
withdraw from this land before it is too late,'' the leaflets said.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean leftist students echo the policies of communist
North Korea. They claim that the presence of the 37,000 U.S. troops
in South Korea hinders unification of the divided Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The students also demanded Washington's apology for the alleged
mass killings of unarmed South Korean civilians by U.S. soldiers
during the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   They, in particular, demanded a speedy U.S. Investigation of the
alleged massacre of hundreds of South Korean civilians at No Gun
Ri, a hamlet in central South Korea, in July 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Citing dozens of surviving villagers and American veterans, The
AP reported in September that retreating U.S. soldiers
machine-gunned some 400 civilians cowering under a railroad tunnel
at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and South Korean governments then began investigations
into the No Gun Ri incident. The U.S. government said it would
finish an investigation before the 50th anniversary this year of
the Korean War on July 25.
</P>
<P>
   ''Marking the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean
War, people's anti-U.S. voice becomes louder and louder,'' students
said in the leaflets.

<HEADLINE> Big Game Jackpot Grows to $325M  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The odds of hitting tonight's Big Game jackpot of
$325 million with a $1 ticket are about the same as putting a
finger down on a list of everyone in America and landing on an
ex-president.
</P>
<P>
   And no one seems to care.
</P>
<P>
   For days, gas stations and grocery stores have been swamped with
people hoping their numbers -- some carefully chosen, others
computer-picked -- would bring them the big prize.
</P>
<P>
   If it goes to just one person after tonight's drawing, the
jackpot will be the richest lottery prize in world history. After
taxes, that lucky person would get either $8.5 million a year for
26 years or a one-time payment of $110 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're dreaming of what they'll do with it for that minute
they're buying it,'' said Kevin Finneran, owner of a Li'l Peach
convenience store in South Boston. ''People love talking about it
for that minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how big is the jackpot?
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen times bigger than all of the prize money given away on
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Enough cash to pay the entire
Minnesota Twins baseball team until 2020.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Game is played in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In Cana, Va., just across the North Carolina state line, 200
lottery players lined up at an Exxon station before sunrise Monday.
One man bought $3,050 in tickets, and gasoline sales suffered all
day because the parking lot was full.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the sixth day in a row it's been that way,'' manager
Leo Bobbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, so many people tried to access the lottery's Web
site that the server crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The jackpot could keep on growing. It already tops the previous
American record, a $295.7 million Powerball jackpot split by 13
machinists in Westerville, Ohio, two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The world lottery record is $1.2 billion, set last December by
Spain's El Gordo, or the Fat One. But that game spreads itself thin
-- thousands of prizes are awarded in a four-hour ceremony that
brings the country to a standstill as orphaned children sing out
the winning numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The odds that a $1 ticket in today's Big Game will have all six
winning numbers are one in more than 76 million -- about the same as
flipping a coin and seeing heads 26 consecutive times.
</P>
<P>
   W. Scott Wood, who teaches a class on psychology and gambling at
Drake University in Iowa, explains the long odds to his students
this way: ''Try to imagine the equivalent of sticking a pin in the
Los Angeles white pages and hitting your cousin's name. Or throwing
a rock off the Empire State and hitting someone you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple University math professor John Allen Paulos said the game

attack between the time he buys the ticket and the drawing than he

4 Gunned Down at Sierra Leone Rally
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- British troops moved to secure Freetown's
airport for the possible evacuation of its citizens following clashes in the
capital that left four dead. The country's notorious rebel leader also
disappeared from his U.N. guard, prompting fears of more unrest. The United
Nations late Monday began evacuating some of its 266 nonessential civilian
employees. Another 55 were staying in Freetown, U.N. officials said. A Clinton
administration official, meanwhile, told the United Nations that the U.S. Air
Force was prepared to fly a battalion of U.N. peacekeepers from Bangladesh --
roughly 700 to 800 soldiers -- in coming days.

New Blood Thinner Shows Promise
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- A new class of blood thinner shows promise in warding off
dangerous blood clots after surgery and is more convenient to take than the
standard drug, scientists say. In a preliminary study of the medication on
people undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery, those who took the new drug
had half the chance of developing clots in their legs compared to those given
the usual treatment of injections of the anti-clotting agent heparin. The study,
presented Friday at a blood clotting conference in Portugal, was paid for by
Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, which developed the drug.

Carter were to join Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in the East Room Tuesday

primary campaign. The Arizona senator decided against making a more climactic
announcement near this summer's Republican National Convention after tiring of

U.S. Seeks To Ban Roads in Forest

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration on Tuesday will call for
banning road construction in 43 million acres of roadless federal forests and
propose allowing local foresters to decide whether to bar activities such as
logging, mining and off-road-vehicle use. The plan defers a decision on whether
to prohibit roads in 8.7 million acres of the nation's largest forest, the
Tongass in Alaska, until 2004 when agency officials review a separate plan

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Center Stage'  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTY LEMIRE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''Center Stage'' works best when it's about the dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet scenes are choreographed and performed exquisitely,
whether they are traditional performances of ''Romeo and Juliet''
or more contemporary creations. They are breathtaking and glorious
to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, in between the dance sequences, the actors are
allowed to talk. This is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers from the American Ballet Theater and other prestigious
companies play some of the film's key roles. But just because they
can dance doesn't mean they can act. And usually, they can't.
</P>
<P>
   ''Center Stage'' is about a group of young dancers who join the
fictitious American Ballet Academy, the nation's premier school,
which feeds into the world's greatest ballet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Like ''Fame,'' there is an opening sequence in which we see each
of the main characters get accepted into the academy. And because
there is entirely too much exposition, we learn who each of them is
pretty quickly.
</P>
<P>
   There's Jody (Amanda Schull, a dancer with the San Francisco
Ballet who looks eerily like Jennie Garth from ''Beverly Hills
90210''), who is beautiful, blond and winsome. She finds out fast
that her body and form aren't ideal and doubts whether she belongs
in the academy.
</P>
<P>
   Saucy Eva (Zoe Saldana) comes from the tough streets of Boston
and has little respect for the academy's rigid ways. She shows up
late for class, chews gum and sasses the instructors, but is
amazingly talented.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck-up Maureen (Susan May Pratt), every instructor's favorite,
has perfect form. She also has a pushy stage mother, an eating
disorder and no personality.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie (Sascha Radetsky of the American Ballet Theater)
literally walks into a room of fellow newcomers and says, ''I just
got in from Seattle. My girlfriend dumped me for leaving her
there.'' Not much mystery there. He's one of the few straight male
dancers and has a crush on Jody.
</P>
<P>
   But Jody -- and every other girl -- lusts after Cooper (Ethan
Stiefel, an ABT principal dancer), a charismatic principal with the
American Ballet Company and a budding choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows them as they struggle, compete, fall in love
and get their hearts broken. It's fun to watch their various
methods of breaking in fresh toe shoes -- pounding them on the
floor, in the shower, in door jambs, with cigarette lighters -- and
spying on their rigorous rehearsals is sort of a voyeuristic
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Center Stage'' was filmed at Lincoln Center and throughout New
York, and director Nick Hytner often asked the professional dancers
in the cast for input, so many of the off-stage moments ring true.
</P>
<P>
   All the adults, though, are two-dimensionally single-minded and
uncaring.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gallagher, one of the few real actors in the cast, plays
Jonathan, the rigid academy director. Like Debbie Allen's character
in ''Fame,'' he gives an intimidating welcome speech to his new
students. Later, he has discouraging words for Jody, such as, ''I
just want you to really think if this is the right place for you.''
That's about the extent of his character.
</P>
<P>
   We know, of course, that Jody will shine by the end. The outcome
of all the various plots are pretty easy to figure out from the
start. Only the dancing makes getting there bearable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Center Stage,'' a Columbia Pictures release, was written by
Carol Heikkinen (''The Thing Called Love,'' ''Empire Records'').
Susan Stroman and Christopher Wheeldon were the choreographers. It
is rated PG-13 for language and some sensuality, and runs 1 hour
and 53 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Three in Family Are Conductors  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Neeme Jarvi's two sons went into the family
business. And it keeps them thousands of miles -- often continents --
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Like their father, Paavo and Kristjan Jarvi are conductors,
making the Jarvis the only family threesome waving batons in front
of classical musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Neeme, 62, is music director of the Detroit Symphony and
principal conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony in Sweden; Paavo,
37, will become music director of the Cincinnati Symphony in fall
2001; and Kristjan, 27, is assistant conductor of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, and founder and music director of the contemporary
Absolute Ensemble in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''You should see our phone bills!'' says Paavo.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Neeme was conducting ''Carmen'' in Paris while Paavo
was debuting with Italy's La Scala Orchestra and Kristjan's
Absolute Ensemble was playing in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But they remain close, talking often with each other and with
Liilia, Paavo's and Kristjan's mother, and their sister Maarika, a
flutist in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The Jarvis emigrated to America in 1980 from Tallinn, Estonia,
each with two suitcases and $100. They became American citizens in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Neeme stays the busiest. After a recent American tour with the
Gothenburg Symphony, he went to the Bastille Opera in Paris for 10
performances of ''Carmen,'' and in between conducted other opera
and symphonies in Paris. He also went for three days to Estonia,
now accessible again after the Soviet breakup.
</P>
<P>
   He once met a taxi driver in Tokyo who said he had ''no day
off,'' and since then he has liked to think of himself as a ''no
day off'' conductor.
</P>
<P>
   His sons have absorbed his energy, enthusiasm and delight in
conducting -- though not yet his jammed schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father is a complete workaholic,'' Kristjan Jarvi says. ''I
think he doesn't consider it work. He is just, in his way, having
fun. Look at his recordings: He's the most recorded conductor there
is. It's usually composers you never heard of. For him it's like
exploration, like going into the Amazon jungle with a machete. I
think his whole life is an adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeme Jarvi has made almost 350 CDs, most with the Scottish
National Orchestra and Gothenberg Symphony, for two foreign record
companies that like live performances and little-known works.
</P>
<P>
   Paavo Jarvi says his father ''has a music library at home that
puts most large libraries to shame. He's constantly doing premieres
and old pieces that haven't been heard in hundreds of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeme Jarvi's parents were amateur musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father would say, 'Come here. Listen. What piece is
that?''' he recalls. ''I'd say, 'Some kind of Glazunov.' 'You are
right. Now you can go.''' He continued that game with his own
children.
</P>
<P>
   Neeme's older brother Vallo became a professional musician,
playing xylophone and guitar and conducting. Neeme studied in
Leningrad, then returned to Estonia's Radio Orchestra and the
Tallinn Opera, where he met young composer Arvo Part and started
playing his music, which he still champions.
</P>
<P>
   He entered a conducting competition in Rome at age 38 and won.
It made him a hero in his small country; two orchestras met him at
the airport on his return, playing the triumphal march from
''Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, however, he ran afoul of the authorities when
he conducted the Estonian State Orchestra and a choir in Part's
''Credo,'' which has a biblical text. ''It was a big scandal. A lot
of people were sacked from their positions. I finally find out we
have to escape that country and Communist ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Paavo Jarvi says he never thought of becoming anything but a
conductor. ''By the time we were conscious of what we were doing,
it was too late to turn back,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Paavo, who came to America at age 17, envies his father's first
20 years as a conductor, making mistakes and learning in an
isolated country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Conducting is sort of the second half of your life's
profession,'' Paavo says. ''Before 50, nobody is a conductor.
Everything you do then is preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think conducting is sort of witchcraft. It's not really
something you can go to school and learn. Conductors, I think, are
born. It is also a craft where one needs a mentor to guide and
advise. In that way having a father as a conductor was tremendously
valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago he completed stints as principal guest conductor with
the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic and the City of Birmingham
Symphony in England. When he first went to Cincinnati, Paavo says,
he felt good chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something really basic was working well. And I like the
acoustics of that hall. The orchestra has been under very good
leadership for a long time: Jesus Lopez-Cobos. All those things
made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   While he waits to start his job there, he recently made his
debut at La Scala and, unexpectedly, with the Berlin Philharmonic,
when Daniel Barenboim got sick. He conducted an original
instruments ensemble in London. And this summer, with James Levine,
Zubin Mehta and Yuri Temirkanov, he will conduct at a festival in
Switzerland and lead the festival orchestra's world tour.
</P>
<P>
   Kristjan Jarvi, meanwhile, finds his musical identity in the
Absolute Ensemble. He wears a red shirt and black pants to conduct
the 18-piece group, which he says plays ''weird transcriptions of
regular stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Splitting his time between Absolute, the Los Angeles
Philharmonic and guest conducting in Europe, makes him a better
conductor, he says.
</P>
<P>
   At a March concert in New York, Mahler's ''Fourth Symphony'' was
played by 12 Absolute musicians, using a synthesizer and no horns.
The arrangement was made around 1920 by a student of Schoenberg's,
with the synthesizer part written for a harmonium.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're taking the furniture from a yellow room and putting it
into a green room and seeing how it fits. We're about creativity,
musicality and self-expression,'' says Kristjan. ''We try to create
an atmosphere with music, lighting and setting.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should have fun when they go to hear music,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> PM-CT--Children-Violence, 1st Ld-Writethru,370  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Yale's school of medicine is opening a
new center devoted to a single children's health issue -- violence.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 2.8 million reports of child abuse a year,
and 9 million children witness violent acts, Deputy U.S. Attorney
General Eric Holder said Monday in announcing plans for the new
center.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Children Exposed to Violence is being opened to
raise awareness of the lasting scars of violence for children and
to help to researchers and people working with children who have
been victims or exposed to violence, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Behind each statistic is a vulnerable, feeling child,'' Holder
said.
</P>
<P>
   The center's objective is to prevent violence and children's
exposure to violence, intervene early and effectively with children
and hold perpetrators accountable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yale Medical School Dean Dr. David Kessler said the school was
gratified to be chosen to host the national center.
</P>
<P>
   The center will ''increase capacity of communities and
individuals across the country to respond to the complex needs of
children whose psychological and physical health is challenged
through exposure to the effects of violence,'' Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   The work of the center had been the responsibility of the U.S.
Justice Department. It is being moved to Yale to ensure its future,
Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven and Yale were a natural fit because of the city's long
community policing effort with the Yale Child Study Center that has
brought together the resources and connections other cities need to
combat abuse, Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine communities connected through the Justice Department's Safe
Start project will get training through the center. They will
coordinate child welfare, police, courts, doctors and schools to
prevent an overall approach to preventing violence and treating
children who are the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The other Safe Start communities are: Baltimore, Chicago,
Rochester, N.Y., San Francisco, Spokane, Wash., Chatham County,
N.C., Washington County, Maine, Pinellas County, Fla. and
Bridgeport, Conn.

<HEADLINE> AP Announces Internet Initiatives  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Associated Press is introducing a series of
Internet initiatives to enhance the value of its state news reports
and political coverage to members, president and CEO Louis D.
Boccardi told the AP annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of 1,546 member newspapers gathered Monday on
the first day of the Newspaper Association of America's convention.
</P>
<P>
   AP Chairman Donald E. Newhouse opened the session, which
included a conversation between Boccardi and Alan Diaz, the
photographer who took the news cooperative's photographs of Elian
Gonzalez being removed from the home of Miami relatives last month.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the program were a panel on the 2000 election and talks
by Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi said the coming year would bring ''an ever-stronger
world and national news report; further exploration of the
opportunities and challenges the Internet presents, (and) sharper
focus on better performance on all levels.''
</P>
<P>
   He announced the introduction of the AP Election Center, ''for
online readers who want as much detail as they can get on the
candidates, the issues and the campaigns from the White House to
the statehouse.'' This will be an Internet service that members can
link to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   AP will also offer a site called AP Politics, designed as a
resource for reporters and editors covering campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet initiative called Your AP will allow editors to
access election results in November as soon as the come into the AP
system, rather than waiting for updates to move on the wire.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll know what we know when we know it,'' Boccardi said.
</P>
<P>
   Your AP will be an ongoing resource that keeps members up to
date on the AP news report and developments within the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi said state news reports soon will be delivered in a
format that will enable editors of online editions to post them
easily to newspaper Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The AP's continuing commitment to improving state reports has
led to two new Chicago-based positions, Boccardi said. One is a new
writing coach -- AP's third -- and the other is a new deputy director
of state news.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Gore said he was open to a change in federal
rules that prohibit the same company from owning a newspaper and TV
or radio station in the same area, although he noted that it is up
to the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said he supported revising estate tax laws that create
hardships for families trying to pass a newspaper on from one
generation to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who spoke at the event's luncheon, said President
Clinton was approaching his summit talks with Russian President
Vladimir Putin with an open mind on the subject of U.S. missile
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton decides later this year whether to proceed with an
anti-missile program, he will weigh potential threats as well as
the merits of the technology and the costs, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who will meet with Clinton in Moscow June 4-5, strongly
opposes even the limited program Clinton is considering -- 100
launchers and improved radar designed to stop intercontinental
ballistic missiles that some administration officials are convinced
North Korea, Iran and other so-called ''rogue states'' could fire
at the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, the photographer, said on the morning the 6-year-old Elian
was seized by federal agents, ''I had the instinct, the hunch, that
something was going to go down.'' Diaz said when the raid began he
sprinted into the house and set up in the room where the boy was
being hidden in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   His overriding memory of the raid? ''All I could hear, and all I
could remember, was Elian crying,'' Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi also moderated a discussion of political campaigns with
three AP correspondents. The panel, titled ''A Conversation:
Campaign 2000,'' included Walter Mears, AP vice president and
Washington columnist; Ron Fournier, chief political writer in
Washington; and Marc Humbert, New York State political editor based
in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Mears noted candidates try to avoid negative attacks on their
opponents these days because they think voters don't like it. But
Fournier pointed out that ''the new form of negative campaigning
seems to be to accuse your opponent of going negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the meeting began with the announcement of election
results for the board of directors, held by all-mail balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Four incumbents and three new members were elected to the board.
</P>
<P>
   Elected to new terms were John J. Curley, chairman and CEO,
Gannett Co. Inc., Wilmington (Del.) News-Journal; Newhouse,
president, Advance Publications Inc., Newark (N.J.) Star-Ledger;
John W. Madigan, chairman, president and CEO, Tribune Co., Chicago
Tribune and Orage Quarles III, publisher, Raleigh (N.C.) News &AMP;
Observer.
</P>
<P>
   New members are Walter E. Hussman Jr., president and CEO, WEHCO
Media Inc., Arkansas Democrat-Gazette; Julie Inskeep Walda,
publisher, Fort Wayne (Ind.) Journal Gazette; and Sue Mayborn,
president and publisher, Temple (Texas) Daily Telegram. Walda was
selected to fill one year left in the term of Richard J.
Harrington, who is stepping down. Mayborn was selected to represent
a city of less than 50,000 population.
</P>
<P>
   At a reorganization meeting later in the day, Newhouse,
president of Advance Publications Inc. and of The Star-Ledger of
Newark, N.J., was re-elected chairman of the AP. David E. Easterly,
president and COO of Cox Enterprises Inc., representing the Dayton
(Ohio) Daily News, was elected vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi was re-elected president and chief executive officer of
the news cooperative.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 62; Nasdaq Off 53  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in quiet early trading today
as investors assessed the market for technology stocks after
Monday's sharp drop.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 62.38 at 10.666.01. The Nasdaq composite
index was off 53.39 at 3,615.99.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicator were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 0.48 at 1,423.69.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, which was pummeled Monday following a negative
article in Barron's magazine, rose | today to 63 9/16. Other
high-tech stocks were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   With few major economic indicators coming out and the next
meeting of the Federal Reserve Board a week off, stock trading has
been slow in recent sessions. Monday was the quietest session of
the year so far.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 0.43 today at 500.51.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gains in major stock indicators, declining issues
edged out advancing ones by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York Stock
Exchange, where volume came to 118.38 million shares, slightly
ahead of Tuesday's quiet levels.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. shares seemed to be shaking off weakness in overseas
markets. In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei stock average tumbled
355.42 points, or 1.95 percent, to close at 17,844.54 points, its
lowest level in six months.
</P>
<P>
   European stocks were also trading lower. In afternoon trading,
Germany's DAX index was down 1.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Allergies Blamed on Roaches, Mites  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Droppings left on pillows and bedding by
dust mites and cockroaches may be triggering more asthma and
allergy attacks than previously realized.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the National Institute of Environmental Health
Sciences in North Carolina's Research Triangle Park surveyed a
sample of homes around the country and vacuumed dust from their
beds.
</P>
<P>
   They found that certain proteins from dust mites -- microscopic
arachnids that thrive in humid places and feed on human skin flakes
-- are present in large enough quantities to cause allergies in more
than 45 percent of U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
   In an estimated 23 percent of American homes, the level of dust
mite allergens is high enough to trigger asthma attacks, the
researchers said. That number, which represents about 22 million
homes, shocked environmental health researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Darryl Zeldin, head of clinical studies at NIEHS, said he
had thought the number would be closer to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twenty-three percent. Nobody would have guessed that,'' Zeldin
said. ''Our beds are teeming with dust mite allergens.''
</P>
<P>
   The allergenic droppings of cockroaches were detected in 6
percent of bedding.
</P>
<P>
   Dust allergies can cause congestion, headaches and sore throats,
and asthma has left an estimated 17 million Americans wheezing.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers' findings, to be presented Wednesday to the
American Lung Association/American Thoracic Society conference in
Toronto, were part of the First National Allergen Survey, a
three-year, government-funded $1 million effort based on a sample
of 831 homes across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   From July 1998 to December 1999, technicians went to each home
with a hand-held vacuum cleaner equipped with a special
dust-collecting filter. They vacuumed the main sleeping pillow and
all layers of bedding, down to the top surface of the mattress,
said Patrick Vojta, an NIEHS clinical studies coordinator.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- BellSouth Corp. and a unit of General Electric
will team to offer digital television via satellite in the
telephone company's nine-state turf.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal announced today, BellSouth will become the first
regional phone company to compete with the satellite services such
as the DISH Network and DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, the deal will expand BellSouth's potential market
for entertainment services from a handful of cities to 14 million
households, which will get another choice among wired cable systems
and national satellite providers.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership eventually could include 50 million households.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sets us up for a major video initiative,'' Bob Frame,
president of BellSouth Entertainment, said in an interview today.
''It gives us the capability of offering our customers a full suite
of communication services.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Frame called it ''a
significant, long-term agreement'' between Atlanta-based BellSouth
and GE Capital, based in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth hopes to offer customers one-stop shopping -- packages
that include entertainment along with local phone service, Internet
access, wireless service. Eventually, if it receives regulators'
approval, BellSouth hopes to enter the long-distance call market.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to roll out long-distance service in Georgia,
and possibly another state, by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, BellSouth plans to use satellites for more than
delivering television programs. The technology is capable -- at
least in theory -- of handling e-mail, Internet access, video games
and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But in the partnership with GE, BellSouth will start by
delivering the same Americast package of programs that BellSouth
currently offers in some areas to about 120,000 people who already
receive the service.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth now has digital television service in 11 metropolitan
areas, including metro Atlanta, Orlando and New Orleans.
Programming comes from Americast, an alliance of BellSouth, Walt
Disney Co., GTE Corp. and two units of SBC Communications.
Subscribers receive up to 160 channels. Among them are music,
pay-per-view, broadcast, cable and premium television channels.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, BellSouth's Americast is delivered in several ways --
from antennas on tall buildings and mountains to high-speed fiber
optic cable.

<HEADLINE> Marines Prepare Report on Crash  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Marine Corps investigators believe last
month's MV-22 Osprey crash that killed 19 Marines probably was
caused by a loss of aerodynamic lift that forced the aircraft into
a fatal nose dive.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators are close to ruling out mechanical failure as
a cause and do not believe the investigation will find a need to
redesign the aircraft, a unique hybrid of airplane and helicopter,
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also have found no indication of recklessness by
the pilot, Maj. John A. Brow, 39, of California, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Fred McCorkle planned to disclose the
investigators' latest findings at a Pentagon news conference today
and to announce plans to use two experimental versions of the
Osprey to simulate some circumstances of the April 8 incident.
After that test, to be conducted at Patuxent River Naval Air
Station, Md., the Marines plan to return the regular Osprey fleet
to flight later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The tilt-rotor Osprey takes off and lands like a helicopter but
flies like an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Corps officials who discussed the matter Monday on
condition of anonymity stressed that the investigation is
incomplete. Families of the victims have been informed of the
investigation's progress.
</P>
<P>
   One Pentagon official said investigators are about 90 percent
certain that the crash at a small airport north of Tucson, Ariz.,
was caused by an aerodynamic phenomenon known as ''settling with
power.''
</P>
<P>
   This condition, also known as ''vortex ring state,'' occurs when
a helicopter settles into the wash produced by its own rotor
system. This can happen in circumstances combining a rapid rate of
descent, low forward airspeed and a nearly vertical descent. The
aircraft's descent is so rapid that the flow of air at the inner
portion of the rotor blades is upward rather than downward. The
upward flow of air caused by the aircraft's descent can reach a
level that is greater than the downward flow produced by blade
rotation. At this point the aircraft can sink uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Osprey, the rotors may have been using such a
large proportion of available engine power that the aircraft had
insufficient power left to slow the rate at which it was sinking in
its rotor wash.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what caused the Osprey to get into the
''settling with power'' problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported Monday that the Osprey probably
pitched over as it began sinking, then flew almost straight down
into the ground. Citing unidentified sources, the Post also
reported that investigators are examining the extent to which the
Osprey's fuel tanks were ruptured in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have accumulated evidence from a combination of
sources, including interviews with members of the crew of an MV-22
Osprey that landed at the same airport just moments before the
crash. A member of that crew reported seeing the Osprey nose-dive
into the ground as he looked behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also have gleaned details from the Osprey's flight
data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the deadliest air disaster for the Marines since
22 died in a helicopter crash in South Korea in 1989.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell in quiet trading today as technology
shares gave up early gains and pulled other market sectors lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was off 60.31 at 3,609.07, while the
Dow Jones industrial average was down 3.35 at 10,600.28.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 6.77 at 1,417.40.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks had started the day slightly higher but resumed

<HEADLINE> Northwest Aims To Please Customers  </HEADLINE>
By KARREN MILLS, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines took a close look at the
competition and then held up a mirror to itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't like what we saw, frankly,'' said Charles Breer,
director of product development for the nation's fourth-largest
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest was investing millions to renovate its hubs in
Minneapolis, Detroit, Memphis, Tokyo and Amsterdam, to fix up and
add airplanes to its fleet and to upgrade its ground operations
technology. But it found that its competitors had better
relationships with their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest has been battling negative public opinion that began
in the mid-1990s as it grappled with labor problems. Its pilots
struck for 15 days in 1998, and there have been protracted contract
negotiations with flight attendants -- who reached a tentative
agreement last month -- and the airline's mechanics. And there are
lingering effects from Northwest's performance during a 1999
snowstorm, when passengers were left sitting in planes for eight
hours in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Too much in too little time has gone wrong. That hurts,'' said
Andy Thompson, an airplane cleaner in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   So Northwest asked some of its best customers -- people who spend
hundreds of hours aboard its planes each year -- what it could do to
change people's minds. The company also set up a training program
to help employees better understand passenger needs and it created
a department to help implement customer suggestions for improved
service.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the project, the airline formed an advisory council
including 13 customers from its WorldPerks Elite frequent flier
program. During the council's first meeting last fall in Utah,
Northwest managers listened as the customers blamed the airline's
image problem on poor employee relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your employees do care and a lot of them are frustrated by the
lack of response from Northwest management,'' said council member
Clark Krystek of Plainville, Mass., a businessman who logs more
than 75,000 miles a year on Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Moulton, a Detroit customer who flies more than 25,000
miles annually, told executives their workers ''are your front
line, your eyes and ears on the street. Focus on respect for your
employees and they will undoubtedly deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   Other council members said Northwest should provide better
training so employees are familiar with airline programs and
upgrade technology that saves time for customers.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest played a videotape of those comments at the group's
April meeting in Santa Monica, Calif., and talked about progress
being made in providing more consistent service, improving employee
morale and rewarding loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did hear you,'' said Susan Edberg, vice president for
reservation sales and services.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the airline's changes involve technology and training.
Northwest will introduce new software in June to enable employees
to more quickly identify the airline's best customers, check their
preferences and let the ticketing agent know about any problem,
such as a weather delay or cancellation, on their previous flights
so the airline can apologize and offer a voucher for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we want to get to is treat everybody great, but treat
some people even better,'' Edberg said. ''We'll find people who pay
$100,000 a year to the airline. Things are going to happen for
those people.''
</P>
<P>
   While the airline's best customers will get the top service,
Northwest believes all customers benefit from overall improvements
in service, such as on-time performance, Edberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest is also testing a system -- expected to be available to
all customers by early 2001 -- that will enable a passenger to check
in and print a boarding pass from a home computer. And the airline
is adding more machines for self-service electronic check-in and
using roaming agents with hand-held personal computers to check in
passengers without baggage.
</P>
<P>
   But the airline is also focusing on its employees. In January,
Northwest managers met with cleaners, ramp agents, customer service
representatives and other ground operations workers to ask them how
customers could be better served.
</P>
<P>
   The company has launched a training program called ''Catch the
Spirit'' to help employees understand how to keep customers
satisfied, how to calm angry customers and how to work better with
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Erika Gwilt, director of ground operations education, said she
tells employees to concentrate on customer needs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Make their day, go above and beyond, be there for them,''
Gwilt tells employees. ''It's easy to make somebody's day if
they're happy. How do you make their day better for somebody who's
had a bad day?''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the airline's 14,000 ground operations employees are
attending the training sessions. The airline expects to provide 65
hours of such training to each employee this year.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at a recent training session agreed that Northwest
would be a better company if it had more satisfied employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''If everybody would put themselves in the other person's
position and understand what they do, it would make our jobs
easier,'' said Bruce Ruditis, a ramp worker from Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the advisory council said they were pleased with the
changes Northwest is making.
</P>
<P>
   ''Northwest is going from an almost adversarial relationship
with employees to cooperation,'' said Tom Baggett, a customer from
Memphis who flies more than 75,000 miles a year.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene West, of New York, who flies more than 50,000 miles a
year, told airline executives, ''I really feel that Northwest
management people have been listening. You are trying to improve
the airline in a fiscally responsible way.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe you'll come up with something enticing to keep us with
you for 15 to 20 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Trippler, an airline expert with 1travel.com, a discount
travel booking site, and sometime Northwest critic, said he expects
the airline's reputation for service to improve quickly. He
predicted Northwest would be the best airline for customer service
by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''For an airline that large, I've never seen anyone respond
quicker than they do,'' Trippler said. ''When Northwest says, 'his
is what we're planning to do, I have learned,' believe them.''

<HEADLINE> SUNY chancellor announces economic development post  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The State University of New York is creating
an administrative position to foster development between businesses
and the university system, Chancellor Robert King said.
</P>
<P>
   The job will help promote SUNY as an engine of economic
development, King said in today's edition of the Times Union.
</P>
<P>
   The economic development position will be responsible for
overseeing creation of a database that would include research
specialties, academic programs and grants at each of the system's
64 schools. The database would be accessible to corporations
interested in moving into the state or retraining existing workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an incredible quality and diversity in the
universities in our state that our business community hardly knows
about,'' King told an audience at the annual forum of the Public
Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   King expects to name someone to the post within the next few
weeks. SUNY spokesman E.J. McMahon said a salary has not yet been
determined for the new post.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Fixes Missile Glitch  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The glitch that doomed the Pentagon's last
anti-missile test in January has been fixed and preparations for
the next crucial test in June are proceeding on schedule, the Air
Force general in charge of the project said today.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't have one of those glitches, we think the design we
have will be successful on the next flight test,'' Lt. Gen. Ronald
Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   The test is scheduled June 26.
</P>
<P>
   The previous test, in January, performed as expected until the
final few seconds of flight. Heat-seeking devices aboard the
interceptor rocket, which enable the rocket to ''see'' its target,
malfunctioned because of a plumbing problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''That particular problem, I think -- barring a real stupid
mistake -- is under control,'' Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   In the event the June test fails, there will be another attempt
this fall -- probably in October, Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   The June test is especially important, however, because of a
tight deadline for providing President Clinton with a
recommendation on whether the missile defense system is ready to
start deploying its interceptor rockets and radars. Clinton must
decide whether to proceed by November or December, Kadish said, if
the Pentagon is to have the system ready for use by the end of
2005, as presently planned.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton put off the decision this year, the 2005 target date
would be missed by at least one year, Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-missile system is designed to provide protection for
all 50 states against a ballistic missile attack from a country
such as North Korea, which is developing long-range ballistic
missiles. A base with 20 interceptor rockets would be built in
Alaska, along with a new radar to help guide the rockets to their
target. By 2007, under the current schedule, the system would be
expanded to 100 interceptor rockets.

<HEADLINE> Senators want parents asked before kids are mined for marketingsurveys  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elementary school children were asked to fill
out a 27-page booklet called ''My All About Me Journal'' that was
really a marketing survey for a cable television channel.
</P>
<P>
   Technology firms have provided schools with free computers and
Internet access in return for the right to monitor students' Web
activity by age, gender and ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   In neither of these cases or countless others were parents asked
if they wanted their children to be mined for marketing
information, Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and Richard Shelby,
R-Ala., said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two are pushing legislation aimed at shielding children from
marketing and advertising research conducted in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our children should be instilled with knowledge, not tapped
for information on their spending habits. Their privacy, and that
of their parents should be respected, not exploited,'' Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would require that parents be told in writing
exactly what information about their children will disclosed in a
commercial survey, whether the child can be identified by the
information, to whom the information will go and for what purpose
it will be used. Parents will also be told how much class time will
be spent filling out the survey and what the school expects to get
from the business in return.
</P>
<P>
   Parents would then have to give written permission in order for
their children to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is strictly limited to commercial surveys, Shelby
stressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It focuses on the most questionable conduct by specifically
exempting certain activities such as curriculum development, test
assessment, and college and other post-secondary education
recruiting efforts, among others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both senators acknowledged that financially strapped schools
often have little choice but to accept business ''gifts'' with
strings attached. This bill would simply let parents in on the
process. ''Would you allow them to come into your home and question
your 7-year-old without your permission?'' Dodd asked.
</P>
<P>
   The measure will be introduced early this week as an amendment
to a sweeping bill regulating virtually all federal education
programs.
</P>
<P>
   While that bill appears seriously stalled, the amendment will at
least get people talking about the issue of privacy in schools, the
senators said.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Workers Get Cheaper insurance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Long-term health care insurance would be made
available at lower cost to federal employees and retirees,
including the military, under legislation passed unanimously
Tuesday by the House.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which goes to the Senate, would use the buying power
of the huge federal and military work force to attract lower-cost
bids from private insurers to provide the coverage. Some estimates
indicate costs could be reduced by 15 percent to 20 percent,
supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   Those eligible for the program would include spouses, children,
adopted children, stepchildren and stepparents of federal civilian
and military employees and retirees. They would be responsible for
paying the premiums and could choose to have them deducted from
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   The chief sponsor, Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., said the
measure will ''bring peace of mind for many Americans by reducing
their long-term health care costs.

<HEADLINE> Government To Track Sea Bass  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is launching a system to track
a fish that has become increasingly popular in U.S. restaurants
under the name of Chilean sea bass.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation experts have become concerned that the sharp rise
in popularity of this fish is leading to overfishing. The new
tracking system, being implemented internationally, will help
determine the actual amount of fish being caught.
</P>
<P>
   The fish, also known as Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish, are
caught in the Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, part of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, will handle the monitoring
effort, which will require documentation of all of these fish
imported into the country or shipped through the U.S. to another
country.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Dalton, director of NOAA Fisheries, said ''tracking and
monitoring this import product will discourage unlawful harvest and
give U.S. consumers confidence that the seafood they eat is legally
and sustainably caught.''
</P>
<P>
   International management of toothfish is organized by the
Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources. Member of the organization are countries that fish or do
research in the Southern Ocean.

<HEADLINE> Tech Shares Pull Europe Stocks Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- European stocks were dragged lower Tuesday as
technology shares responded to jitters in the United States, and
the telecommunications sector continued to suffer from negative
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Most European bourses opened to losses after waking up 4 percent
drop on the Nasdaq Stock Market Monday. Shares were down another 2
percent Tuesday. Volume was low, however, as investors remained
nervous about tech volatility and a potential U.S. interest rate
hike later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Europe doesn't seem to be following Nasdaq down as much as
could be expected,'' said Sharon Coombs, analyst at HSBC. ''It is
really telecoms, which are the flagship of Europe's new economy,
that are hurting European bourses.''
</P>
<P>
   The telecom sector fell Tuesday on fears over mobile licenses
fees and concerns over further consolidation in the sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has become much more difficult for European telecom stocks
after the expense of the U.K. license bids and the breakdown of the
merger between Telefonica and KPN,'' said HSBC's Coombs. ''They'll
need much stronger growth to justify themselves now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks companies in
countries that joined the single currency, was down 7.64 points at
433.65. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index was down 102.4 points at
5,182.7.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- European stocks were dragged lower Tuesday as
technology shares responded to jitters in the United States, and
the telecommunications sector continued to suffer from negative
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Most European bourses opened to losses after waking up 4 percent
drop on the Nasdaq Stock Market Monday. Shares were down another 2
percent Tuesday. Volume was low, however, as investors remained
nervous about tech volatility and a potential U.S. interest rate
hike later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Europe doesn't seem to be following Nasdaq down as much as
could be expected,'' said Sharon Coombs, analyst at HSBC. ''It is
really telecoms, which are the flagship of Europe's new economy,
that are hurting European bourses.''
</P>
<P>
   The telecom sector fell Tuesday on fears over mobile licenses
fees and concerns over further consolidation in the sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has become much more difficult for European telecom stocks
after the expense of the U.K. license bids and the breakdown of the
merger between Telefonica and KPN,'' said HSBC's Coombs. ''They'll
need much stronger growth to justify themselves now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks companies in
countries that joined the single currency, was down 7.64 points at
433.65. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index was down 102.4 points at
5,182.7.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies fell
6.62 points to 386.29, while the Dow Jones Stoxx 50 Index fell
111.8 points to 4,926.3

   London's FTSE-100 Share Index fell 1.5 percent to 6,123.8, as

<HEADLINE> Fed Buildings May Get Defibrillators  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defibrillators, which often mean the
difference between life and death for cardiac arrest victims, may
soon be in federal buildings under a bill that passed a House panel
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would direct the Department of Health and Human
Services to develop guidelines for placement of automated external
defibrillators, which can analyze heart rhythms to determine if a
shock is necessary and, when necessary, deliver a lifesaving shock
to the heart. The bill, introduced by Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla.,
also would relieve ''Good Samaritans'' who use the device from
liability.
</P>
<P>
   ''This simple common sense measure has the potential to save
countless lives,'' said Rep. Mike Bilirakis, R-Fla., chairman of
the House Commerce Committee's health and environment panel that
approved the bill on a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 250,000 Americans suffer from sudden cardiac
arrest each year, according to the American Heart Association. Of
that number, an average of 5 percent survive.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of survival from sudden cardiac arrest decrease by
approximately 10 percent per minute until defibrillation. Experts
estimate that 20,000 to 100,000 lives could be saved annually with
greater access to automated external defibrillators, which are
small laptop sized devices that cost about $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas area has seen survival rates rise to 57 percent
since instituting a defibrillator program in 1997 with security
officers as operators of the devices, present in many casinos and
other buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''These results are easily duplicated with the strategic
placement of sufficient numbers of automated external
defibrillators and the proper training of individuals responsible
for their use,'' said Richard Hardman, director of emergency
medical services in Clark County, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   One cardiac survivor, New York attorney Robert Adams, said an
automated external defibrillator arrived at Grand Central Station a
day before he collapsed two years ago, saving his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, timing was everything,'' Adams said. ''Congress can
and should take a leadership role by spreading the message that we
can fight cardiac arrest by putting the tools to save lives in the
hands of those most likely to respond, the lay public.''

<HEADLINE> Cannes Film Festival Opens Wed.  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France (AP) -- Glitz and glamour, or art and politics?
</P>
<P>
   Starlets glistening in skin-baring sheaths, or intellectuals
with messy hair puffing on cigarettes?
</P>
<P>
   It's time for the Cannes Film Festival again, and the perennial
question is: What is this festival about, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   At this year's festival, which opens Wednesday, the question may
have even more relevance. Last year left a strange aftertaste, with
results that many felt were the most bizarre in years.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Emmanuel Schotte and Severine Caneele? Probably not:
They won two of the top acting awards, and they'd never acted
before. They beat out popular veterans like Richard Farnsworth, an
Oscar nominee this year for ''The Straight Story,'' and Bob Hoskins
for ''Felicia's Journey.'' Not to mention the acclaimed actresses
in Pedro Almodovar's popular ''All About My Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   And remember ''Humanity,'' the slow-moving and sexually explicit
tale of a simpleton cop investigating a sordid murder? No? Don't
feel bad -- the film wasn't seen by many even in its native France.
But it won three of the top five awards, including for the two
amateur actors.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the best screenplay award to ''Moloch,'' a movie
that told us much more than we wanted to know about the
relationship between Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun (according to the
film: not a good one). During press screenings, journalists
deserted the plodding film in droves; the jury headed by Canadian
director David Cronenberg saw differently.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the award ceremony itself. It fell apart when
steamy French actress Sophie Marceau emerged to present the Palme
D'Or, or Golden Palm, to Belgium's ''Rosetta.'' The badly
unprepared Marceau rambled on so mysteriously and incoherently that
hostess Kristin Scott Thomas had to cut her off in mid-speech.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, most newspapers savaged the awards, and festival
head Gilles Jacob felt compelled to issue a statement. Though he
stood by the jury's freedom of choice, he changed the rules to ban
the awarding of too many prizes to one film. Cronenberg defended
his choices, saying the jury was not in the business of playing
slave to public tastes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the festival is looking to start afresh. The jury is
headed by Luc Besson -- a Frenchman, but as Hollywood as they come
here.
</P>
<P>
   Besson, director of 1997's futuristic ''The Fifth Element'' and
the recent ''Joan of Arc,'' would ''lead the festival decidedly
into the future,'' Jacob said. And Besson's role at Cannes was
heralded by the French film magazine Premiere:
</P>
<P>
   ''His presidency at Cannes is a consecration,'' it said,
praising his vision of ''a cinema liberated from the heritage of
the New Wave, which left the Americans with a monopoly on
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of the films? As usual, they are a hodgepodge of
established names and new faces, with a heavy dose of Cannes
favorites, such as veteran British director Ken Loach, Denmark's
never-boring Lars Von Trier, and the famous American brothers and
Cannes darlings, Joel and Ethan Coen.
</P>
<P>
   Among the films garnering attention:
</P>
<P>
   -- ''O Brother, Where Art Thou,'' directed by Joel Coen.
</P>
<P>
   The Coen brothers ruled Cannes in 1991 with ''Barton Fink,''
starring another Cannes regular, John Turturro, who's back in this
story about three chain-gang escapees on a musical journey through
1930s Mississippi. Also back is John Goodman and another Coen
favorite, Holly Hunter. But if the star quotient here is off the
charts, the reason is George Clooney, the erstwhile Dr. Doug Ross
of ''ER.'' His journey up the famous red steps of the festival
palace should bring the loudest screams of the fortnight.
</P>
<P>
   -- ''Dancer in the Dark,'' by Von Trier.
</P>
<P>
   The Danish director scored big with ''Breaking the Waves,'' then
reduced many to head-scratching with ''The Idiots,'' his study of
young people pretending to be idiots to get in touch with their
inner selves. His new film stars French icon Catherine Deneuve with
the Icelandic pop singer Bjork -- surely already a winner in the
strange-pairing category.
</P>
<P>
   -- ''Bread and Roses,'' by Loach.
</P>
<P>
   With ''My Name is Joe'' in 1998, this veteran of social drama
looked at a former alcoholic struggling to keep his life together
in gritty Glasgow. This time, Loach looks at immigrants in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   -- ''Kippur,'' by Amos Gitai of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gitai brought ''Kadosh,'' the first Israeli film
chosen for official competition in a quarter century. He's at
Cannes for the second year in a row, a virtually unheard-of feat.
''Kippur'' -- still furiously undergoing finishing touches in
Gitai's studio in Israel -- looks at the 1973 war that began on the
Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur and centered around the Golan Heights.
With Israel now considering a return of the strategic plateau to
Syria, the timing could hardly be more prescient.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Emmy-award winner Holland Taylor will replace
New York City first lady Donna Hanover in the off-Broadway play
''The Vagina Monologues.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanover, who was supposed to perform in the sexually suggestive
show beginning May 30, postponed her appearance last week, citing
family circumstances. She did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, announced April
27 that he has prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 56, won an Emmy for best supporting actress last year
for her portrayal of a sexy middle-age judge in the TV show ''The
Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The play consists of monologues delivered by three different
actresses and includes such frank topics as orgasms, pelvic exams,
sexual abuse, sexual fantasies and childbirth. Taylor will appear
with Kirstie Alley and Hazel Goodman.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The lawyer for a Brazilian model who bore Mick

request for an increase in child support from $10,000 to $35,000 a

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall in Quiet Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell in quiet trading on Wall Street
today as technology shares gave up early gains and pulled other
market sectors lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was off 117.31 at 3,552.07, while the
Dow Jones industrial average was down 63.04 at 10,540.59.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 18.36 at 1,405.81.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks had started the day slightly higher but resumed
their decline as traders took profits from Friday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, which was pummeled Monday following a negative
article in Barron's magazine, fell 1 5/16 to 61 9/16, and
Hewlett-Packard fell 4 1/16 to 131|. Other tech shares also edged
lower. Cisco reports earnings after the close of trading today.
</P>
<P>
   Bucking the downtrend in tech stocks, shares of 3Com rose
sharply after the maker of computer network equipment said it would
complete the spinoff of Palm Inc. several months ahead of schedule.
3Com shares rose 3\ to 46 15/16 while Palm shares fell 4[ to 28[.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, which announced earnings that beat analyst estimates,
rose { to 52~.
</P>
<P>
   With few major economic indicators coming out and the next
meeting of the Federal Reserve Board a week off, stock trading has
been slow in recent sessions. Monday was the quietest session of
the year so far.
</P>
<P>
   William P. Miller, chief investment officer of large cap
equities at American Express Asset Management Group in Minneapolis,
said investors were continued to trim their holdings of tech stocks
after a recent runup and parking their money in traditional
safe-haven stocks like drug and food makers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the market is moving to a consensus that the Fed is
going to raise rates, and that they might hgave to be more
aggressive than they thought,'' Miller said. ''People are booking
profits ahead of next week, and since much of the runup was in the
tech sector, that's where they're selling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 12.25 today at 492.78.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a 3-to-2 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 589.02 million
shares, slightly ahead of Tuesday's quiet levels.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas markets also had declines. In Tokyo, the benchmark
Nikkei stock average tumbled 355.42 points, or 1.95 percent, to
close at 17,844.54 points, its lowest level in six months.

<HEADLINE> In rematch, conservative assemblyman has help in challenge againstRoukema  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- No stranger to contested primaries, Rep. Marge
Roukema had an uncomfortably close brush with defeat two years ago
when she beat fellow Republican Scott Garrett by 1,700 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett is back, and this year he has help. The Club for Growth,
a new group advocating ''the Reagan vision of limited government
and lower taxes,'' is helping him raise money. Former presidential
candidate Steve Forbes endorsed him, as did Republican Rep. Tom
Coburn of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Roukema, the longest-serving woman in the House, has stood for
years as a symbol of a perennially threatened species in Congress --
the moderate Northeast Republican. Unlike most House members, she
draws opposition in primaries even after two decades in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why do you think they do this to me all the time?'' Roukema,
R-Ridgewood, mused during a recent interview in her office, noting
that fellow New Jersey moderates Rodney Frelinghuysen and Bob
Franks do not attract the same degree of intraparty competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I weren't a woman,'' she continued, ''they wouldn't be
doing this to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her critics say Roukema is a target at election time because of
her record, not her gender.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're asking voters to look at her record for 20 years, and to
look at my record for 10 years,'' said Garrett, 40, a member of the
state Assembly since 1990. ''If you do, you'll see she has a record
of raising taxes many times, of opposing tax cuts a number of
times, and increasing the role of federal government in the areas
of health care and education.''
</P>
<P>
   Roukema, 70, insists she is fiscally conservative but in line
with her district on social issues. She points to endorsements by
Republican leaders, including House Speaker Dennis Hastert, to
prove her conservative credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Roukema says her 1998 response to Garrett's challenge was too
subdued. ''This year we're certainly going to wage a very
aggressive campaign, and have been,'' she said. ''I'm not letting
anything slip by.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Roukema-Garrett match will be favored in the
fall against Democrat Linda Mercurio, an adjunct professor at Seton
Hall Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Roukema and Garrett share a party affiliation, but little else:
</P>
<P>
   --Roukema supports abortion rights, which Garrett opposes.
</P>
<P>
   --Garrett favors school vouchers, which Roukema considers a
threat to public education.
</P>
<P>
   --Garrett would allow people to put a substantial amount of their
Social Security payroll taxes into privately run investment
accounts. Roukema said diverting money to private accounts could
undermine the whole idea of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   --Roukema supports the main campaign finance reform proposal
pending in the House; Garrett says it would protect incumbents and
limit free speech.
</P>
<P>
   --Garrett favors term limits, which are opposed by Roukema,
seeking her 11th term in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Roukema and her five Republican colleagues from New Jersey last
year helped Democrats approve a controversial health insurance
reform measure that included a new right to file lawsuits. Roukema
stands proudly behind that vote as a blow for ''patient
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, by contrast, says congressional efforts to regulate
health insurance are fundamentally misguided. ''I believe that
federal regulation of insurance should end, and go back to
states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the two candidates disagree on Roukema's
record on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett accuses Roukema of voting for ''some of the largest tax
increases in U.S. history.'' But Roukema voted against the tax
hikes implemented under President Clinton in 1993 and President
Bush in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on the matter, Garrett said Roukema supported a 1982 tax
increase -- one written chiefly by Republican Sen. Bob Dole and
signed by President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Responded Roukema, ''He's campaigning against me now for
something that was passed in 1982?''
</P>
<P>
   She highlighted the tax cuts she supported, from Reagan's tax
cut in 1981 to the GOP's unsuccessful $792 billion proposal in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Leila Bate, executive director of the Club for Growth,
acknowledged that Roukema has voted with her party to pass large
tax cuts, but added: ''She only does it after much kicking and
screaming, and we believe that it would be better to have someone
who is rock solid at his core, who knows instinctively what to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   As in 1998, Roukema has been endorsed by the party chairmen in
the four counties fully or partially in the 5th Congressional
District: Warren, Sussex, Passaic and Bergen. But Garrett won three
of the counties in 1998, losing only in Bergen, Roukema's base and
the largest county in the district.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett said some people voted for Roukema in 1998 to give her
one more term but will not be as generous this time. ''I've had a
number of people say that after 20 years, it's time to jump ship --
that is the phrase that people use,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if 20 years in Congress have diminished Roukema's enthusiasm
for the job, she doesn't show it. In fact, a victory by Roukema
could give her a piece of history if Republicans retain control of
the House.
</P>
<P>
   Her seniority, combined with House Republican rules limiting
committee chairmen to six years, have Roukema in line to chair the
House Banking Committee beginning next year. She would be the first
woman to chair a major committee.

<HEADLINE> Judge blocks Newark ordinance banning ATM fees for noncustomers  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Bankers have temporarily blocked a Newark
ban on fees for noncustomer use of automatic teller machines, using
the same arguments that derailed a similar ordinance adopted by
Woodbridge.
</P>
<P>
   A federal lawsuit requesting a permanent injunction charges that
the city's ordinance is pre-empted by laws that leave regulation of
banks to federal and state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Such ordinances have also been stopped in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit by two industry groups and six banks was filed
Thursday, and U.S. District Judge Joseph A. Greenaway Jr. that day
granted their request for a temporary restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   A date for a hearing on the injunction has not been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The Newark City Council had voted 9-0 on Wednesday to adopt the
ordinance, which found ATM fees have ''increased at an alarming
rate'' in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   If upheld, the ordinance requires the approval of Mayor Sharpe
James, who reportedly supports the concerns of the bankers. James
spokeswoman Pamela E. Goldstein said Tuesday she did not know what
the mayor would do.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Woodbridge ban, Newark's includes independently owned
ATMs, often found in small groceries, in addition to those operated
by banks.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodbridge ban was temporarily restrained in February by
Greenaway, who found the banks provided ''overwhelming evidence''
that the ordinance was pre-empted by federal and state banking
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The judge may consolidate the two cases.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of banning ATM fees claim that banks are charging
much more than what the transactions cost them.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Bankers Association, which brought the suits
against Woodbridge and Newark, counters that most banks lose money
on ATM transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Woodbridge, in Middlesex County, was the first New Jersey town
to adopt an ATM-fee ordinance. Newark, the state's largest city, is
the second.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, a statewide ban on ATM fees has been upheld only for
banks chartered by the state government. The state Supreme Court in
Connecticut rejected a statewide ban similar to Woodbridge's
proposal. In California, the bans are on hold in San Francisco and
Santa Monica while the courts consider the issue.

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs Kosovo, Colombia Funds  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Appropriations Committee approved
emergency aid today for victims of U.S. natural disasters, for
anti-drug efforts in Colombia and peacekeeping in Kosovo after
voting to restrict future American action in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal by committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, for $7.2
billion in assistance grew to roughly $8 billion, aides estimated,
after the committee debated the plan for nearly 3{ hours and
approved several additions.
</P>
<P>
   By 23-3, the committee also adopted a provision by Sen. Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., that would require the next president to withdraw
American peacekeeping troops from Kosovo by July 2001 unless
Congress has approved leaving U.S. forces there.
</P>
<P>
   The House narrowly rejected a similar amendment in March.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate panel's votes came more than a month after Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., backed by conservatives,
blocked work on a larger version of the emergency aid package. Lott
supports the smaller proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The funds the committee approved are less than the $13 billion
bill the House approved March 30 but more than the $5.2 billion
President Clinton initially requested.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a free-standing bill, the money was divided among
three routine spending bills for military construction, foreign aid
and agriculture for the coming fiscal year that the committee
approved by voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   By trimming the emergency funds and attaching them to must-pass
spending bills, Stevens was addressing Lott's objections that a
separate package would have been too expensive and time-consuming.
Lott and other GOP leaders want Congress to adjourn as early as
possible so lawmakers can return home and campaign for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Since stalling the earlier measure, Lott has come under pressure
from administration officials and others who argue the money is
needed urgently, especially aid to Colombia's embattled government
for fighting drug traffickers who control large swaths of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The new package contains $5.7 billion for U.S. peacekeeping in
Kosovo, anti-drug efforts in Colombia and other Defense Department
programs. Included was money for Pentagon fuel purchases and the
military's financially ailing health-insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   Another $1.5 billion was for the aftermath of last fall's
Hurricane Floyd, which battered parts of the East Coast, and other
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate breakdown available of the money for
Colombia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton requested $1.3 billion for Colombia, on top of $300
million already provided, while the House approved $1.7 billion.
Clinton requested about $2.8 billion for Kosovo and other Pentagon
needs, while the House approved $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also sought $1 billion for disasters, while the House
provided $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill included $4 billion lawmakers added for the
Defense Department to upgrade weapons and other expenditures.
Stevens' measure excluded that money, which GOP leaders plan to
include in the Pentagon's regular 2001 spending bill to be written
in coming weeks.

<HEADLINE> American Ballet Theater Opens Season  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The American Ballet Theater opened an eight-week
season at the Metropolitan Opera House with a gala evening of
bravura and romantic duets and the premiere of a fine ballet by
Twyla Tharp.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographer Donald Saddler helped celebrate the company's 40th
season, which began Monday night, by sharing the stage with
Annabelle Lyon and Miriam Golden. The three danced in the first
opening night on Jan. 11, 1940.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-minute Tharp ballet, set to Brahms' ''Variations on a
Theme by Haydn,'' followed the glittering duets. It is remarkably
well organized and clear. Tharp paints with big choreographic
strokes, showing that she can structure large forces. There are 30
dancers and sometimes there are two back rows of couples, dancing
different steps. But the work never looks muddled.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Kent and Angel Corella worked well together and looked as
though they enjoyed dancing together. The other leading couples
were Susan Jaffe and Marcelo Gomes, and Paloma Herrera and Vladimir
Malakhov.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers in ''Variations on a Theme by Haydn'' wore simple tan
and beige. Strong technique is necessary -- and these dancers had it
-- but the lifts, carries and spins contributed to a solid,
substantial ballet, not to flamboyance. The ballet had its premiere
at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., in March. This was the
New York premiere. Tharp has choreographed 16 ballets for the
company in the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Corella thrilled the audience with his dancing in a pas
de deux from ''Le Corsaire'' with Jaffe. Jose Manuel Carreno was
also thrilling in a Rudolf Nureyev staging of ''Diana and Acteon.''
Herrera danced the pert Diana.
</P>
<P>
   The evening began with a ''Swan Lake'' pas de deux by Julie Kent
and Corella. Nina Ananiashvili was the gallant but sad ''Dying
Swan.''
</P>
<P>
   Alessandra Ferri and Julio Bocca danced a passionate pas de deux
from ''Manon.'' Amanda McKerrow and Malakhov danced a fresh as
springtime ''Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux.'' Kent and Bocca led a large
cast in the finale of ''Theme and Variations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ermanno Florio conducted for the evening. During final bows,
many former dancers of the American Ballet Theater joined the
present company on stage.

<HEADLINE> Hopkins Student Has Meningitis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- A Johns Hopkins University graduate student was
in critical condition Tuesday with bacterial meningitis, a
potentially fatal inflammation of the brain lining and spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   Students and staff at the university's Homewood campus were sent
e-mail urging them to seek treatment with antibiotics if they had
close contact with the student, Marcus Dale Weicker, 25, of
Hubbard, Ore. Doctors confirmed Weicker has bacterial meningitis,
Union Memorial spokeswoman Amy Strong said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are about 3,000 cases every year. Bacterial
meningitis is fatal in about 10 percent and causes serious harm,
including brain damage, in another 10 percent, according to the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The infection is spread through close contact, such as kissing
or sharing a drink. Symptoms include headache, stiff neck, fever,
nausea and vomiting, with severe cases leading to convulsions and
delirium.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC recommended last fall that all U.S. campuses inform
students about meningitis and make vaccines accessible.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, the General Assembly this year passed a bill
requiring college students in the state to be vaccinated against
the bacteria that cause meningitis or sign a waiver stating they
understand the risks of contracting it.
</P>
<P>
   University spokesman Dennis O'Shea said about 1,000 of the 5,000
students at the Homewood campus took advantage of a meningitis
vaccination program offered last fall.

<HEADLINE> Russia Warns Chechen Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- A top Russian commander appealed Tuesday
to Chechen rebels to surrender before a May 15 amnesty deadline,
while Russian troops paraded through Chechnya's capital to mark the
55th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Russians' claims that they control most of the rebel
republic and have wiped out major resistance, the insurgents show
no sign they are ready to give up. Small rebel bands continued to
attack Russian posts Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Gennady Troshev, head of Russian forces in the region, said
rebels should ''assess the situation, think hard and lay down their
arms.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People are tired of the war,'' Troshev said in a statement.
''They need peace and a normal life. Make use of the amnesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has offered amnesty through May 15 to fighters who
surrender with their weapons if they are found not to have
committed what federal authorities consider series crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian Interior Ministry troops and a pro-Moscow
Chechen militia paraded through the capital Grozny to mark Victory
Day, a major holiday across the former Soviet Union. Federal forces
have occupied Grozny since February.
</P>
<P>
   A few dozen World War II veterans attended the parade through
the capital's shell-cratered streets. Russian troops sought out the
veterans in Grozny's basements, where most residents have been
living since Russia's bombing campaign began in August.
</P>
<P>
   Chechens who fought with the Soviet army feel betrayed by the
Russian military, and receive little of the acclaim showered on
veterans elsewhere on Victory Day.
</P>
<P>
   No major rebel attacks were reported Tuesday, despite Russian
fears of a large-scale offensive to coincide with the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In the neighboring republic of Dagestan, however, security
officials disarmed two bombs Tuesday on the central square in the
capital Makhachkala, an hour before a Victory Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs were found by a sniffer dog near a statue of Soviet
founder Vladimir Lenin, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces also disarmed mines on six stretches of roadway
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Clashes were reported in the Vedeno, Nozhai-Yurt and Shatoi
regions. Rebels shot at Russian checkpoints in Grozny's Oktyabrsky
district, near Urus-Martan, and in Assinovskaya, ITAR-Tass said. No
Russian casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces have occupied the northern, lowland part of
Chechnya, but for months have been hunting rebels in the southern
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Fog and rain halted air strikes in Chechnya over the past 24
hours, the air force said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, a top member of Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov's government, National Security Service chief Ibragim
Khultygov, was detained in southeastern Chechnya, according to
Russian officials in Gudermes. Khultygov took over the security
service when his predecessor and brother Lecha was killed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops entered Chechnya after Chechnya-based Islamic
militants seized villages in Dagestan in August, and after about
300 people were killed in Russian apartment building explosions
that the government blamed on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Pepsi, Bestfoods To Market Soymilk  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Coming soon to theaters: A cold soymilk-and-fruit
drink to wash down that hot, buttered popcorn. The drink is a
product of PepsiCo Inc.'s Tropicana, one of several big food and
beverage companies trying to get in on the growing market for soy.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods, known for such brands as Skippy, Karo, Mazola and
Hellmann's, is using the supermarket industry's trade show this
week to introduce a new soymilk for the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies that have jumped into the soy business, either
through joint ventures or acquisitions, include Kellogg Co., Kraft
Foods Inc., H.J. Heinz Co. and the nation's two biggest dairy
processors, Dean Foods Co. and Suiza Foods Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Soy beverage sales in mainstream supermarkets reached $126
million for the year ended in February, a 60 percent increase,
according to data compiled by tracking firms SPINS and A.C.
Nielsen. That's still a fraction of the $22 billion worth of soda
and milk that Americans buy annually, but analysts expect the soy
market to continue growing, in part because the Food and Drug
Administration is allowing soy products to bear a claim that soy
protein lowers blood cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now soy is the miracle ingredient,'' said Lynn
Dornblaser, editorial director of New Product News.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy producers are worried enough about soy's potential that
they petitioned the FDA earlier this year to bar soy beverages from
being called ''milk.''
</P>
<P>
   Tropicana's drink -- an icy smoothie made with juice, fruit
puree, soymilk and soy protein -- is a joint venture with a small
Florida firm, Galaxy Foods Co., that's been making vegetarian
cheese since the 1960s. In addition to Regal theaters in Florida,
the drink also is going to be tested in selected restaurants and
Kroger supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a great alternative to the sodas,'' said Nora
Julian of Carpinteria, Calif., after sampling an orange smoothie at
the trade show Tuesday. ''The only drawback is that it's so cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods has been selling soymilk in Latin America for the past
10 years but waited until this spring to introduce the product in
the United States. Known as NutraBlend, the U.S. version will be
less sweet than the Latin American product.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the health claim that FDA approved last fall, soy
products must contain at least 6.25 grams of soy protein per
serving, one-fourth of the 25 grams daily that studies have shown
is needed to show a significant cholesterol-lowering effect. An
ounce is a little more than 25 grams.
</P>
<P>
   A glass of soymilk contains about 6.5 grams per serving. A soy
burger patty typically has about 10 grams. A 12-ounce Tropicana
smoothie will have 8 grams.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg and Kraft are both marketing veggie burgers: Kellogg,
through its acquisition last year of Worthington Foods, the biggest
maker of soy-based meat alternatives, and Kraft, through its
purchase in February of Boca Burger. Kellogg also has introduced a
soy cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Foods took a minority stake last year in Boulder,
Colo.-based White Wave Inc., a vegetarian food company that makes
Silk, a refrigerated soymilk. With Dean's backing, Silk is now sold
in nearly 14,000 stores nationwide, compared to 100 in 1998. Suiza
Foods introduced its own rival product in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a fad. You're going to see yogurts and a lot of other
soy products out there,'' said Tom Murin, a Suiza official.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials acknowledge its a challenge to get consumers
to try the product, although flavors have been added to mask the
soy. White Wave plans to give away 3 million half-pint cartons in
stores this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely got an aftertaste,'' said Marcia Collins of
Cleveland, Ohio, after trying Suiza's Sun Soy.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Opposition Cancels Rally  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   POZAREVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav government blocked a
planned opposition rally in President Slobodan Milosevic's hometown
Tuesday, detaining critics and journalists, stopping buses from
heading for the rally and deploying hundreds of police to shut off
access to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the massive government effort, pro-democracy
opposition leaders backed down and canceled the rally in Pozarevac,
55 miles east of Belgrade. They cited ''repression, violence and
terror'' as reasons for the cancellation, saying the alternative to
giving in would have been ''clashes among the citizens, even civil
war in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not want to drag Serbia into chaos, anarchy and civil
war,'' said one of the opposition leaders, Vuk Obradovic.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's opponents decided to reschedule the rally for Monday
and hold it in the capital, Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Pozarevac rally was scheduled to protest last week's beating
of three student activists who clashed with close associates of
Milosevic's son, Marko. It would have been the first big opposition
gathering in Pozarevac, a Milosevic stronghold known within
opposition circles as ''the forbidden city.''
</P>
<P>
   But early Tuesday, police deployed in Pozarevac, setting up
checkpoints and blocking access to the city. Authorities used
document checks to hinder foreign and domestic reporters from
coming, and several local journalists were detained.
</P>
<P>
   In other cities throughout Serbia, police prevented buses with
opposition supporters from leaving for the rally and detained
scores of anti-government activists.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, four buses were ordered to undergo ''technical
inspection'' before being allowed to leave. Police then stopped the
buses again on the outskirts of Belgrade, and about 200 of the
would-be protesters responded by blocking traffic on the highway
leading to Pozarevac and demanding passage. They sat on the road,
preventing hundreds of cars from passing for about two hours before
riot police moved them.
</P>
<P>
   In Novi Sad, in northern Yugoslavia, police arrested 17
activists of the student organization Otpor, or Resistance, who
were distributing leaflets saying, ''Death to Fascism + Down With
Milosevic  Freedom For the People.'' Eight reporters for
independent media were detained with them.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters and most of the students were later released, with
four student activists still held in Novi Sad by nightfall, Otpor
said. Authorities gave no reason why they had been held.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Milosevic met World War II veterans in Belgrade to
mark the 55th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany. During his
speech, Milosevic referred to the Unites States as a ''fascist
power'' that wants to conquer the world with the help of domestic
''traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   He told the veterans that the Serbs, ''with their superior and
victorious ways ... will defeat this new fascism,'' according to
the state Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
   In Pozarevac, about 150 Milosevic supporters marked Victory Day
at the same venue where the opposition protest had been scheduled.
About 200 local opposition demonstrators confronted the
pro-government supporters, shouting ''Red Bandits, Thieves and
Killers,'' but there were no direct clashes.
</P>
<P>
   In its evening broadcast, state-run television reported that a
dozen ''hooligans and criminals, led by fascist members of the
terrorist Otpor group'' tried to disrupt the Pozarevac gathering
and that police arrested several individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's most popular independent radio, B2-92, went off the
air amid its live broadcast from Pozarevac. The radio's director,
Veran Matic, said the broadcasts were being jammed.

   'Love Bug' Suspect Free for Now
</P>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Investigators searching for the
author of the ''ILOVEYOU'' computer bug freed a suspect today, but
said they are decoding 10 names that might be linked to the
worldwide virus attack. The FBI got the names from Sky Internet, a
Philippine Internet service provider. The names -- apparently chat
room or e-mail identifiers -- could be pseudonyms for a single
person or several people, investigators said. They are believed to
be connected to the Philippines' AMA Computer College.

   LONDON (AP) -- Germany's BMW agreed today to sell the ailing
Rover car group to a British consortium. The Phoenix consortium,
led by former Rover chief executive John Towers, said it expects to
lay off fewer than 1,000 workers and make Rover profitable within
two years. BMW said it has agreed to lend Phoenix $765 million to
help the consortium get Rover off the ground. Phoenix said it would
take over responsibility to develop, produce and distribute Rover
cars, and also would acquire the MG brand.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr. will be entombed
alongside his late father, the swashbuckling star of silent films,
at Hollywood Forever cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks Jr., who starred in such films as ''Sinbad the
Sailor,'' ''Catherine the Great,'' ''The Prisoner of Zenda'' and
''Little Caesar'' died Sunday in New York. He was 90.
</P>

<HEADLINE> British Closing 5 N. Irish Sites  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The British Army will close two
bases and abandon three observation posts in Northern Ireland, the
province's police chief said Tuesday, in response to the Irish
Republican Army's move to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Notwithstanding a significant ongoing threat posed by
dissidents, the weekend's events represent a real lowering of the
overall threat,'' said Sir Ronnie Flanagan, the chief constable of
the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Troop strengths of just under 14,000, the lowest in 30 years,
will not be affected by the closure of bases in Cookstown and
Londonderry, officials said. The latter was the army's last outpost
in the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic area of the city west of the
River Foyle.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came three days after the IRA announced it
would open its arms stockpiles to international inspectors in order
to verify that the weapons have been put ''beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish government then announced that they hoped
to restore power to Northern Ireland's new power-sharing government
-- the centerpiece of 1998's Good Friday peace agreement --on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Kelly, a Sinn Fein negotiator who served a prison sentence
for IRA bombings, said the announcement of the base closings was
welcome, but long overdue. ''The process of demilitarization should
have begun immediately after the signing of the Good Friday
agreement,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mandelson, the British Cabinet member in charge of
Northern Ireland, said he hoped ''that conditions on the ground
will enable us safely to make further changes in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the observation posts marked for closing is at Cloghogue,
south of Newry near the Irish border in southern County Armagh, an
area known as ''bandit country'' for its reputation as an IRA
stronghold. The other posts are at Broadway and New Lodge in west
and north Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   If the level of threat remains low, Flanagan said, he intends to
order the closing of the army's base in the center of Crossmaglen,
also in south Armagh, in three months.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Flanagan makes his decisions in consultation with
the army commander, independent of the political process. However,
Sinn Fein and the Irish government had previously floated the idea
that an IRA gesture on arms could be made in return for a reduction
in the British military presence.
</P>
<P>
   The next critical decision for the peace process is in the hands
of the Ulster Unionist Party, which must decide whether the IRA has
done enough to satisfy its demand for disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Britain suspended the Northern Ireland government in February to
prevent a walkout by Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, whose
party gets the largest share of Protestant votes in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA said Saturday that it has agreed to allow two
independent inspectors -- Cyril Ramaphosa, former chairman of the
African National Congress, and retired Finnish president Martti
Ahtisaari -- to periodically assess its hidden weapons stockpiles to
verify they have not been used.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Panel Urges China on Rights  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- A U.N. panel on Tuesday urged China to abolish
policies under which criminal suspects can be sent to labor camps
for up to three years without trial.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups said the panel didn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   In its verdict after a two-day examination of China, the
Committee against Torture pressed Beijing to investigate all
allegations by human rights groups that suspects are tortured. The
panel stopped short of condemning China over accusations -- which
the Chinese delegation called ''groundless'' -- that such tactics
are widespread.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said it is ''concerned about the continuing
allegations of serious incidents of torture, especially involving
Tibetans and other national minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups say beatings, forced labor, bad food and
poor medical care are common in Chinese prisons. While top Chinese
officials have expressed opposition to the use of torture, such
policies are often not enforced at the local level, the groups say.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had hoped that the committee would express more concern as
every year Tibetan prisoners are dying in prison,'' said Drakmar
Gyapon of the Tibet Bureau for U.N. Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Yu Ping, a legal adviser for New York-based Human Rights in
China, told reporters the committee ''highlighted very important
things in China.'' However, he said it failed to address
allegations that evidence obtained by torture can still be used in
court.
</P>
<P>
   In its verdict, the panel said ''the absence of a uniform and
effective investigation mechanism'' to examine torture allegations
is worrying. It welcomed progress but noted that reforms are not
implemented uniformly through China.
</P>
<P>
   It recommended that China ''consider abolishing ... all forms of
administrative detention,'' which allows suspects' long-term
internment in labor camps, and abolish requirements for suspects to
apply for permission for see a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also expressed concern over ''reports of coercive and
violent measures resorted to by some local officials'' to enforce
China's rigorous birth-control policy. Most couples have been
limited since the late 1970s to one child, with fines and other
penalties for violators.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai told the panel the conclusions
would be given to the Chinese government ''for serious
consideration,'' but rejected the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the conclusions by the committee were based on the
allegations by some non-governmental organizations,'' Qiao said.
''I must regrettably make it clear that these are groundless.''
</P>
<P>
   At the session last week to examine China's report on its
compliance with a 1984 convention against torture, Chinese
officials said the nation has moved to stamp out torture, but
conceded weaknesses remain in supervising the country's judicial
system. They defended Beijing's policy of ''reeducation through
labor,'' arguing that it had stopped many people from sliding
further down the path to crime.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, U.S. efforts to censure China's record at the U.N.
Human Rights Commission failed, as in eight previous years. The
panel voted 22-18 not to open discussion of the matter.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Pulls Stock Market Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell in quiet trading on Wall Street
today as technology shares gave up early gains and pulled other
market sectors lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was off 66.09 at 3,603.24, while the
Dow Jones industrial average was down 42.66 at 10,560.97.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 12.05 at 1,412.12.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks had started the day slightly higher but resumed
their decline as traders took profits from Friday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, which was pummeled Monday following a negative
article in Barron's magazine, fell 3/16 to 62 11/16, and
Hewlett-Packard fell 3{ to 132 3/16. Other tech shares also edged
lower. Cisco reports earnings after the close of trading today.
</P>
<P>
   Bucking the downtrend in tech stocks, shares of 3Com rose
sharply after the maker of computer network equipment said it would
complete the spinoff of Palm Inc. several months ahead of schedule.
3Com shares rose 3 11/16 to 47] while Palm shares fell 3{ to 28}.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, which announced earnings that beat analyst estimates,
rose 1 1/16 to 53 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   With few major economic indicators coming out and the next
meeting of the Federal Reserve Board a week off, stock trading has
been slow in recent sessions. Monday was the quietest session of
the year so far.
</P>
<P>
   William P. Miller, chief investment officer of large cap
equities at American Express Asset Management Group in Minneapolis,
said investors were continued to trim their holdings of tech stocks
after a recent advance and parking their money in traditional
safe-haven stocks like drug and food makers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the market is moving to a consensus that the Fed is
going to raise rates, and that they might hgave to be more
aggressive than they thought,'' Miller said. ''People are booking
profits ahead of next week, and since much of the runup was in the
tech sector, that's where they're selling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 9.30 today at 490.78.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a 7-to-5 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 705.95 million
shares, moderately ahead of Tuesday's quiet levels.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas markets also had declines. In Tokyo, the benchmark
Nikkei stock average tumbled 355.42 points, or 1.95 percent, to
close at 17,844.54 points, its lowest level in six months.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Jew-Arab Genetic Link  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Tradition says the biblical patriarch Abraham
fathered both the Jewish and Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, new DNA-based research reveals a genetic link between Jews
and Palestinians, suggesting the two peoples, locked in a bitter
struggle for more than a century, indeed share a common ancestry
dating back 4,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published Tuesday in ''The Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences'' in Washington, D.C., says the Y
chromosome found in Jewish men may go back to a common pool of
Middle Eastern ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   After the first major Jewish exile of 586 B.C., when Jews
dispersed across Europe and North Africa, Jews largely retained
their genetic identity, one that was formed in the Middle East,
according to the study, led by Michael Hammer of the University of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Even after centuries of exile, Diaspora Jews remained closer to
each other and more similar to Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese
in terms of shared Y chromosome characteristics than to people in
their host countries, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eventually people will realize that they are not that
different,'' said Batsheva Bonne-Tamir, a geneticist from Tel Aviv
University who participated in the study.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she cautioned that the techniques were new and that until
the human genome is mapped, it will be difficult to be certain
about the conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The study compared the male, or Y, chromosome, which is passed
from father to son in 1,371 males from seven groups of Israeli Jews
of various origins and 16 non-Jewish groups in the Middle East,
Africa and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer identified 19 variations of the Y chromosome, including
eight lineages found to varying degrees among Jews and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Based on this measure, the study found that despite the many
centuries their ancestors had spent in exile in different parts of
the world, the Israeli Jews in the sample had the closest genetic
links.
</P>
<P>
   Next in genetic affinity to Jews were Palestinians and Syrians,
followed by Saudi Arabians, Lebanese, and Druse, a Middle Eastern
sect that practices a secret form of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   According to the research, in one of the lineage branches, the
percentage of variation in the Y chromosome between Jews and
Palestinians differed by only 1 percent compared to a difference of
5 percent between Jews and Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   A low rate of intermarriage between Diaspora Jews and gentiles
was a key reason for the continuity, Bonne-Tamir said. For example,
since Jews first settled in Europe 80 generations ago, the
intermarriage rate was estimated to be only about 0.5 percent in
each generation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, according to the Y chromosome results, Jews of
European descent living in Israel have closer genetic affinity to
Syrians than to the non-Jews of the countries they came from.
</P>
<P>
   Hebrew University geneticist Howard Cedar said even though Y
chromosomes are considered the best tool for tracing genetic
heritage, researchers still don't know what the history is behind
the variations. As a result, it is difficult to draw conclusions
about genetic affinity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is in the interpretation,'' Cedar said. ''It's
very difficult to reconstruct the histories of these events, it's
difficult to interpret.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonne-Tamir, who heads the National Laboratory for the Genetics
of Israeli Populations, said that until recently, such research on
genetic affinity was limited to classical markers, such as blood
groups and enzymes.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic link between Jews and Arabs suggested by the study
is reflected in the biblical account in Genesis of how Abraham
fathered two sons: Ishmael by his wife's maid Hagar, and then, when
Sarah was able to conceive, Isaac. Although Muslims give a
different version of the story, they revere Abraham and Ishmael --
or Ibrahim and Ismail, -- just as Jews do Abraham and Isaac.

<HEADLINE> Court orders new trial because jurors advised colleagues  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Two nurses should not have provided medical
opinions to fellow jurors on evidence in a homicide case and the
convicted man should get a new trial, the state's highest court
ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-member Court of Appeals panel also called on judges in
all future cases in New York to ''direct that jurors may not use
their professional expertise to insert facts and evidence.'' The
unanimous opinion was written by Judge Joseph Bellacosa.
</P>
<P>
   The decision concerns the case of Michael Maragh, 26, who was
convicted of criminally negligent homicide in Orange County Court
November 1997 in the death of his girlfriend and mother of his two
children in their Middletown apartment.
</P>
<P>
   His attorneys argued that 26-year-old May DeGroat died of an air
embolism caused by having sexual intercourse too soon after giving
birth. She had the couple's second child nine days earlier.
Prosecutors contended Maragh beat the woman and that the blood loss
killed her.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses, according to court documents, offered to the entire
jury their own professional opinions on the case, which they came
to after sharing a room while sequestered. One offered her own
calculation on the effect of blood loss on DeGroat. The jury
convicted Maragh on its second day of deliberations and one of the
other jurors later testified that the nurses' opinions directly
affected the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The court wrote Tuesday that when jurors who have professional
knowledge ''take the additional, forbidden step beyond the evidence
of the cases'' of advising jurors, ''that would violate the rights
of litigants to have their cases decided only on the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The nurses' remarks came to light through reports in The Times
Herald-Record in Middletown.
</P>
<P>
   A county court judge called for a retrial but the district
attorney's office asked for a reversal from the Appellate Division
of state Supreme Court, which reinstated Maragh's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office had argued that the county
judge's instructions that the jurors could utilize their ''personal
experience'' in deciding the facts of the case entitled those with
medical backgrounds to share that knowledge with the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Maragh was originally sentenced to 1-1/3 to four years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to jail March 31 following the reinstatement of his
conviction and has not been allowed to see his two young sons, who
now stay with their maternal grandmother, said his attorney, Ben
Ostrer.
</P>
<P>
   Orange County District Attorney Frank Phillips said he will
press to get Maragh convicted again.

<HEADLINE> Edwards Trial Jury Reaches Verdict  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Jurors reached a verdict today in the
racketeering trial of former Gov. Edwin Edwards but also suggested
their decisions might not be made public immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which began deliberations April 24 and was cut to 11
members after one juror was removed last week, told U.S. District
Judge Frank Polozola it had finished deliberations but needed time
to fill out the complicated verdict forms.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors' note also reminded the judge that they needed to
leave court no later than 4:30 p.m. CDT because one of them has an
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, a defense attorney representing Edwards son,
Stephen Edwards, said he would ask the judge to call a mistrial
because the jury had seen transcripts of secretly recorded
conversations that contained underlined phrases.
</P>
<P>
   The jury told the judge about the markings on Monday but said
jury members had not been prejudiced by what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys frequently made marks in the
transcripts throughout the four-month trial, but the judge had
asked that the jurors be given transcripts that were clear of any
notations from either side.
</P>
<P>
   The four-term governor, his son, a state senator and four others
are accused in a series of extortion schemes to manipulate the
licensing of Louisiana riverboat casinos from 1991 through 1997. If
convicted on all counts, Edwards, 72, could get more than 300 years
in prison.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Faulted on Nuke Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese authorities were slow to react to a
nuclear accident last year that killed two workers and exposed
hundreds of others to radiation, according to a study to be
published next week.
</P>
<P>
   The report, to be published May 19 in the U.K.-based Journal of
Environmental Radioactivity, found that officials waited more than
six hours before monitoring radiation levels at the plant in
Tokaimura, 70 miles northeast of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ''They could have done something to stop the accident sooner''
had monitoring started promptly, said Kazuhisa Komura, professor of
nuclear chemistry at Kanazawa University and a leader of the study,
obtained Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation levels close to the area of the plant where the
uncontrolled nuclear reaction occurred reached a maximum 100 times
the annual amount judged safe for humans, Komura said.
</P>
<P>
   However, all except for three workers -- two of whom later died
and one who was hospitalized -- were evacuated before they had been
exposed to lethal doses of radiation, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Komura said that the research team is evaluating blood samples
from about 50 people who were exposed to radiation in order to
determine any future health risks.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Ministry-funded study also said
higher-than-expected uranium concentrations at the site suggest
that there may have been other radioactive leaks prior to the Sept.
30 accident.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 439 people were believed to have been exposed to
radiation at the JCO Co. uranium-processing facility after workers
triggered an uncontrolled atomic reaction by using too much uranium
to make fuel.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier investigation found that workers at the plant
routinely violated safety procedures, including mixing uranium in
buckets to get work done quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Hisashi Ouchi, 35, died of multiple organ failure on Dec. 21
after having been exposed to a massive amount of radiation. He was
the first person in Japan to die as a result of a nuclear plant
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Masato Shinohara, 40, also died of multiple organ
failure.
</P>
<P>
   A third worker, Yutaka Yokokawa, was hospitalized for exposure
to a lesser amount of radiation and was discharged in December.

<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A black police lieutenant who said he found a
noose made out of yellow crime scene tape hanging over his
motorcycle is suing the city, claiming he was a victim of
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Valimore Williams filed the Superior Court lawsuit Monday
because the department had taken more than a year to investigate
his complaints and still hadn't informed him of a resolution, said
his attorney, Henry F. Owens III. Williams is seeking unspecified
damages.
</P>
<P>
   An internal affairs probe is its final review, a police
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 56, found the noose over his police motorcycle in a
department garage in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A white officer admitted placing it there but said it was a
practical joke and had no racist intent. The officer was charged
with breaking department rules and reached a settlement with the
department, said Mary Jo Harris, a legal adviser to the department.
</P>
<P>
   Williams accused a second white officer of jamming his radio so
he could not communicate with other officers. The officer was
disciplined.

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures declined Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade after forecasts called for a wet week ahead
in Midwestern growing regions.
</P>
<P>
   Corn dipped to a one-week low as the rainy outlook further
eroded concerns about dry soil conditions that have lingered for

   Soybean prices also dropped for a second straight day, pressured
by not only the damp weather but by record soybean plantings so far
this season, which increase the significance of near-term moisture.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Is Called Drug Pipeline  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite its status as U.S. soil, Puerto Rico
is the main Caribbean pipeline for illegal drugs heading to the
U.S. mainland, officials told a Senate panel Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cocaine and heroin traffickers from Colombia have transformed
Puerto Rico into the largest staging area in the Caribbean for
illicit drugs destined for the U.S. market,'' said Michael Vigil,
the Drug Enforcement Administration's agent in charge in the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   About 512 metric tons of cocaine came into the United States
last year, with one-fourth of that traveling somewhere through the
commonwealth's 300 miles of coastline and secluded cays, officials
from the DEA, Customs Service and the Coast Guard told a Senate
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not maintained control of our own backyard,'' said
Vice Admiral John Shkor, commander of the Coast Guard Atlantic
Area.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine flow into Puerto Rico has increased threefold in the
last two years, despite the increase in seizures by American
officials, he said. And once it's in Puerto Rico -- a 110-mile long
island with the third-busiest seaport in North America -- smugglers
have fewer problems getting it to the United States because things
from the island are not searched by Customs, Shkor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once it's in Puerto Rico, from a customs standpoint, it's
effectively in Kansas,'' said Shkor, who plans to make the drug
trade in Puerto Rico one of his main focuses this year.
</P>
<P>
   The drug trade in Puerto Rico and other Caribbean countries like
Haiti will continue to rise with U.S. border officials cracking
down on the smuggling through Mexico, Vigil said. In the 80s,
officials started cracking down on the Caribbean drug trade, so the
drug runners moved their operations to Mexico. Now that officials
have moved their forces to America's southwest borders, the
smugglers are moving back to the Caribbean, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without question, the illicit drug trade has a devastating
effect not only on the United States, but also on those countries
that are being used as transit points,'' said Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's criminal
justice oversight subcommittee. ''Puerto Rico's murder rate, much
of it drug-related, is reported to be the highest in the United
States or its possessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that 80 percent of the documented murders in
Puerto Rico are drug-related, Vigil said.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti also is becoming a big problem, said John Varrone, acting
deputy assistant commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service's office
of investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The political instability in Haiti, combined with its lack of
law enforcement capabilities provides a safe haven to drug
smuggling operations,'' he said. ''Haiti is clearly well positioned
for traffickers to use as a path of least resistance, particularly
when enforcement activity in Puerto Rico is high.''
</P>
<P>
   Varrone showed the subcommittee video tapes of drug smugglers
doing fly-by drops of drugs to waiting trucks and desperate boaters
ramming customs boats in an unsuccessful attempt to escape capture.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, pointed out that Cincinnati had 464
heroin arrests in 1999, compared to 19 in 1990. He said he will
push for increased funding for Customs, the Coast Guard and DEA to
help stop of the flow of drugs through the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ability of our law enforcement to succeed in keeping drugs
off our streets is directly linked to our ability to keep drugs
from ever reaching our shores,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Voters Don't Heed All Endorsements  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the ritual of presidential peacemaking,
nominees in waiting minimize their differences with defeated
rivals, disputes are shelved and the loser endorses the winner with
a ''take-the-medicine'' smile.
</P>
<P>
   That is a step for party unity, but what comes later will
determine whether it also is a step toward re-enlisting voters who
preferred the other guy in the primary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsements do not necessarily deliver votes in the general
election; even the enthusiastic campaign Sen. John McCain said he
intends to wage for Gov. George W. Bush for president doesn't mean
his reform-minded followers will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there are degrees of enthusiasm. And that
take-the-medicine line was McCain's, after he and Bush held their
90-minute Republican peace talk on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainties of such forced betrothals are written into the
campaigns of the past 40 years, since Richard M. Nixon, as vice
president, conceded platform points to New York Gov. Nelson A.
Rockefeller in a secret deal made to placate the leader of liberal
Republicans. Nixon was on his way to the 1960 GOP nomination, and
he didn't want a distracting issues fight at the national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   So just before it opened, he accepted the deal that came to be
called the Treaty of Fifth Avenue, with platform terms that angered
conservatives but avoided a Rockefeller challenge. Sen. Barry
Goldwater compared it to the appeasement of Munich, but told his
conservative followers to stick with the ticket anyhow, saying they
could take over later. They did, and nominated him in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon narrowly lost the 1960 election to John F. Kennedy. And
the Democratic ticket won Rockefeller's New York.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Republican peace in the 1964 campaign; Goldwater
saw to that when he defiantly told the national convention that
extremism in the defense of liberty was no vice, and that he didn't
expect the support of those who did not agree with his conservative
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he was going to get it anyhow; Rockefeller was his
chief rival for the nomination and there was no bridging their
differences. It was a landslide year for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1968, they were the shattered party, torn by the war in
Vietnam. Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey could not rally anti-war
Democrats, and their candidate, Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy, did not
try to help him. McCarthy did endorse the Democratic ticket -- two
days before the election Nixon won.
</P>
<P>
   President Ford narrowly won the 1976 Republican nomination over
Ronald Reagan, then governor of California, and paid a
post-midnight call on the loser to seek unity. They appeared
together afterward and Reagan said he'd support the ticket. But he
did little national campaigning that fall.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, it was Reagan's turn. George Bush challenged
him until late in the primaries before conceding with a pledge of
wholehearted support, and winding up as the 1980 vice presidential
nominee, on the path that led him to his one term as president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he told George W. Bush that he did not want to be
considered for vice president. Bush said he took the senator at his
word.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy delivered the appropriate pledge
of support after losing to President Carter, but theirs was no
political embrace. There was friction between their camps into the
fall, over agendas that never really meshed, and over the bills the
Kennedy operation sent the Carter campaign for the senator's
travels and advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   There can be other political costs in peacemaking efforts. Gov.
Michael Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic nominee, negotiated a truce
with rival Jesse Jackson, and Republicans later made it part of
their argument that Dukakis was too liberal to be president.
</P>
<P>
   For the winner, the peacemaking goal is to gain the support of
the loser without capitulating on issues used in gaining primary
victories. For the loser, it is to demonstrate party loyalty
without surrendering on his issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will continue to pursue the issues of reform,'' McCain
assured his supporters on Tuesday, as he and Bush both said they
agreed on more issues than they differed about. That is usually
true of party rivals, of course.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he will campaign at a heavy pace, for Republican
House and Senate candidates and for the Bush ticket. He needs that
demonstration of party loyalty to be in position for a 2004
nomination bid should Bush lose to Vice President Al Gore. McCain
reached past the GOP this year to gain the votes of independents
and Democrats in open primaries. He'd need a more solid Republican
base for another try.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are limits to loyalty shows. Bush has his
nominating majority of Republican National Convention delegates,
but at least 240 delegates will be committed to vote for McCain. He
said nothing about releasing them before the convention.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Attack Troops in Sri Lanka  </HEADLINE>
By DILSHIKA JAYAMAHA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A day after the Sri Lankan government
rejected a temporary cease-fire offer from separatist rebels, Tamil
Tigers attacked troops defending the northern Jaffna peninsula. It
was the first fighting there in nine days.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament also extended emergency rule for another month,
giving the military sweeping powers to seize property, ban
publications and demonstrations and make arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The two attacks -- with machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades
and mortars -- were the first since April 30 by the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam against soldiers manning a defensive line set
up to halt the rebel advance toward Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the rebels offered a temporary cease-fire to enable
Sri Lankan troops to withdraw from Jaffna, a city of 500,000 that
is considered the center of Tamil culture. The Tamils had used
Jaffna as the capital of their autonomous rebel state from 1990-95
and are pressing to recapture it.
</P>
<P>
   Ariya Rubasinghe, the government's chief spokesman and censor,
said the troops repulsed both the assaults and forced the rebels to
withdraw southward.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte told parliament that troops
had moved forward from their defensive line 15 miles southeast of
Jaffna city and plan to push the rebels ''back beyond Elephant
Pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels overran Elephant Pass, a strategic causeway that
links Jaffna peninsula with the mainland, on April 21. Ratwatte
released the first official government figures on that battle,
saying 358 troops were killed and 2,568 injured.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police prevented a new nationalist party from holding
a public meeting to rally the country against the rebels. The
Sinhala Heritage party opposes special status for Tamils, who are
18 percent of country's 18.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Police holding batons asked the crowd of 300 people in Colombo
to disperse. The crowd did so after initially resisting.
</P>
<P>
   The party that says its aim is to safeguard the rights of the
majority Sinhalese.
</P>
<P>
   The group's call came as the government set up vigilance
committees Tuesday to protect the Tamils in Colombo and other
cities against a backlash from the Sinhalese.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital, soldiers with assault rifles stood along the
streets; others patrolled on motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   ''This government will ensure that there is no violence of any
sort against anyone, especially against Tamils,'' Media Minister
Mangala Samaraweera said.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-Tamil wave in 1983 spurred the militancy. Enraged by the
deaths of 13 Sinhalese soldiers in the north, Sinhalese mobs
attacked Tamil homes in Colombo and other places, killing nearly
2,000 Tamils and driving hundreds of thousands to neighboring
India. Tamils of Sri Lanka and India share a language, culture and
family links.
</P>
<P>
   The government censors all local and foreign news reports about
the war and prohibits news organizations from contacting the rebels
for comment.

<HEADLINE> Report: Sri Lanka Receives Arms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Sri Lanka has received arms and
ammunition in order to rescue thousands of soldiers from Tamil
Tiger rebels advancing on the key northern peninsula of Jaffna, Sri
Lanka's top diplomat to India said Tuesday. He declined to describe
the arms or say where they had come from.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Mangala Moonasinghe's comments were the first
official confirmation that Sri Lanka had received arms since rebels
overran the strategic Elephant Pass causeway two weeks ago and
headed toward their former stronghold of Jaffna. The fighting has
been the fiercest in years.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the private Star-TV network Tuesday night,
Moonasinghe would not give details on the arms, according to the
United News of India news agency. But in the last week, Sri Lanka
has renewed diplomatic ties with Israel, and a team of military
officials from Russia visited recently.
</P>
<P>
   India has refused to offer military assistance to Sri Lanka,
fearing it would anger millions of Tamils in the southern state of
Tamil Nadu. Tamils in both nations share a language, culture and
family ties.
</P>
<P>
   Moonasinghe also denied reports that Sri Lankan Foreign Minister
Lakshman Kadirgamar asked for military help when he called on
India's prime minister in New Delhi last week.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, India sent its soldiers to help the Sri Lanka
government crush the Tamil uprising. Some 2,000 Indian soldiers
were killed and thousands of others were wounded in the fighting.
India pulled out its soldiers in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Senators Tackle Student Privacy  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- School kids in Massachusetts tasting cereals
and answering questions on them. Elementary students in New Jersey
keeping personal journals for a marketing survey.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan proposal in Congress would require that most public
elementary and secondary schools get parents' written consent
before collecting information from pupils for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal's Senate sponsors, Sens. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., cited those examples Tuesday and
others, such as a technology firm that provides schools with free
computers and Internet access and monitors students' online
activity by age, gender and Zip code.
</P>
<P>
   ''More and more, schools are being perceived not just as centers
of learning but also as centers of commercial research,'' Dodd said
at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   In some schools, he suggested, ''The three Rs now stand for
research, retail and resale'' and children are being used as
''marketing tools in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The national Parent Teacher Association has endorsed the student
privacy proposal and a companion measure in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that students should not be asked to relay private
information as a condition of learning,'' PTA spokeswoman Patty
Yoxall said by telephone from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, groups representing school administrators and
school board members have expressed opposition to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   It would have ''a chilling effect on the positive productive
collaborations in which local schools and businesses are currently
involved, by drastically increasing the administrative and
financial responsibilities of the local school,'' the National
School Boards Association and the American Association of School
Administrators said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   And Dodd and Shelby said they had heard objections from some
companies that have commercial contracts with schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've touched a money nerve,'' said Shelby, who is a leader of
the recently formed bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd and Shelby spoke as the Senate debated changes to the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which provides money for
schools to help improve poor children's grades and test scores,
train teachers and other programs. Their proposal opened a new
front in a widening legislative campaign over privacy, including
measures designed to protect consumers' financial and medical
information.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd and Shelby said they planned to propose their student
privacy measure as an amendment to the 35-year-old school funding
act, which expires this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, a parallel measure proposed by Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif., has been attached to that chamber's version of the school
funding act.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals would require all schools that receive money under
the act -- roughly 86 percent of the nation's public schools -- to
get parents' permission before collecting data from students that
companies use for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   They also would require that parents be informed in writing of
the data to be disclosed and to which companies, how the companies
plan to use it, how much class time will be taken up by gathering
the data and how much money, if any, the companies are paying the
school under their contract.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the proposal would allow schools to seek federal
money to help them notify parents of data-collecting activities.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal ''simply provides knowledge and choice,'' Shelby
said. ''It does not dictate a particular outcome; rather it gives
parents a clear picture regarding what is going on in their
children's classrooms and an opportunity to decide ... whether they
want their kids to participate in them.''

<HEADLINE> Ultra-Nationalist Croatians Nabbed  </HEADLINE>
By IVO JAGATIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- At least seven ultra-nationalists were
arrested Tuesday for harassing anti-fascist demonstrators at an
annual celebration of the victory over the Nazis in World War II,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said seven people had been arrested for trying to provoke
a clash between the two rival groups, who numbered about 2,000
people in all. State-run television later reported 22 people had
been arrested. At least one anti-fascist demonstrator was also
believed to have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, anti-fascist groups have been holding
rallies at a popular downtown square on May 9, known as V-Day,
demanding that the government restore the old name of the square,
which honored antifascism.
</P>
<P>
   But they have regularly met resistance from supporters of late
authoritarian President Franjo Tudjman's nationalist party, which
changed the name of the square in 1991 to commemorate Croatia's
historical heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The nationalists shouted insults and threw fruit, eggs and
flares at those who joined the rally, but police intervened
quickly, detaining the worst troublemakers. About 500 police had
been stationed in the square to keep order.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Zoran Pusic, the leader of the civil rights group
Council for Civil and Human Rights, lost a tooth in the melee and
the current President Stipe Mesic, was also attacked. Thirteen
offenders were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mesic delivered a speech expressing support for the
restoration of the old name.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing sentiments have flared in Croatia since Tudjman's
nationalists lost power in elections early this year and in
response to the new pro-democratic government's policies to comply
with an international war crimes tribunal and return rebel Serb
refugees.

<P>
	   WATERFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A judge must rule on a motion to dismiss
a lawsuit seeking to shut down Millstone 3 nuclear power complex
during the flounder spawning season.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Coalition Against Millstone is seeking the
shutdown of Millstone 3 because of concerns over a decline in the
fish population. Superior Court Judge Seymour Hendel was expected
to rule this week on a motion by Northeast Utilities to dismiss the
lawsuit.
</P>

   Meanwhile, a state Department of Environmental protection report
concludes that Millstone is responsible for the loss of some fish.
The report, described by the DEP as its best estimate and ''simply
speculative,'' claims the nuclear complex is responsible for 29
percent of the collapse in the Niantic River winter flounder stock
since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ''One thing we are certain about is that the winter flounder
population in the Niantic River is at the point of collapse,'' Dave
Simpson, supervising fisheries biologist at the DEP, said Monday.
''The more difficult question is how much regional factors
contributed to that as opposed to a localized effect. And in that
localized case we're talking Millstone.''
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation is the most critical yet of Millstone as the
possible cause of the dramatic reduction in winter flounder, an
important commercial fish.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how much of the damage to the winter flounder is
caused by the massive intake of water sucked into the nuclear power
plants to cool the reactors. Billions of microscopic fish larvae
are destroyed in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of water intake increased dramatically with the
opening of the Millstone 3 plant in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   NU contends that most of the larval losses come from Niantic
Bay, not the Niantic River, and so would have a minimal impact on
the winter flounder larvae.
</P>
<P>
   NU also contends that overfishing is the primary cause of the
flounder decline.
</P>
<P>
   The DEP's estimate of the impact is greater than NU's
assessment, but lower than the findings of environmental groups,
Simpson said.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco 1Q Profits Surge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco PLC credited higher oil prices and fatter
refining profits for a 256 percent rise in its first-quarter
operating profit to $2.71 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The results for the oil conglomerat do not include exceptional
one-time items. BP Amoco earned $761 million during the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The results were near the top end of what many analysts had
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco completed its acquisition of Los Angeles-based Atlantic
Richfield Co. in April. The company is now positioned ''to deliver
substantial benefits from further cost reductions and margin
improvement from new business,'' while also maintaining the
competitiveness of its existing operations, chief executive John
Browne said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profit for exploration and production, BP Amoco's
biggest line of business, more than quadrupled in the three months
ended March 31 to $3.21 billion from $750 million during the first
three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The company benefitted during that period from the soaring price
for crude. It received an average of $24.75 per barrel in the last
quarter, compared to $10.45 a year before.
</P>
<P>
   Cost savings and lower exploration expense also helped, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profit for BP Amoco's refining and marketing business
rose 86 percent to $674 million, from $346 million a year ago.
Improved profit margins, particularly in the United States, led the
improvement, BP Amoco said.
</P>
<P>
   Higher volumes and cost cutting helped the company's chemicals
business improve its operating profit to $259 million, up 26
percent from its year-ago level of $206 million.
</P>
<P>
   Browne described the outlook for BP Amoco as ''broadly
positive.'' Continued cost cutting and increased investment should
lead to further growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In trading, BP Amoco shares fell 3.2 percent from Monday to
close at 577.5 pence ($8.84) each, on a bout of profit-taking after
the company disclosed the results.

<HEADLINE> Official Warns on Korean Summit  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Given North Korea's track record, no one
should be particularly optimistic about next month's summit on the
divided peninsula, South Korea's ambassador said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   South Koreans have ''great expectations'' for the June 12-14
meeting between their president, Kim Dae-jung, and North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il because of their decades-old hope for
reunification of the country, said Lee Hong-koo, ambassador to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's tightly controlled system, however, makes it
difficult for leaders there to change much, even should they want
to, Lee said in a speech at Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally, when North Korea makes one step forward, the past
record is they take two steps back,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   He said leaders in the isolated and totalitarian North ''are
very much concerned'' that giving away too much to make peace with
the democratic South could destabilize their system of government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are now going through a very difficult period ... trying to
write a very last chapter of the history of the Cold War,'' said
Lee. ''Whether we can write that chapter successfully, and without
another war: that is the question today.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Koreas say reunification is their ultimate goal, but the
two Kims are expected to hold back on that mammoth task at their
June meeting. Even without any such breakthrough, their meeting
would be in itself the most significant diplomatic event on the
peninsula since its division into communist North and pro-Western
South in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides did not sign a peace treaty at the end of the
1950-53 Korean War and have remained technically at war, with
37,000 U.S. troops stationed in the South to help keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   The June summit, the first meeting ever between leaders of the
two countries, is to focus on economic issues and security, Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that a very positive atmosphere will be created in
that meeting, so that in subsequent meetings we can make major
progress,'' he said. ''But excessive optimism is something we
should refrain from.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea, impoverished and desperate for economic help, has
moved to improve ties in recent months with Italy, Australia,
Japan, the Philippines, the United States, Britain and others. Its
overtures are a break in its traditional policy of shunning most of
the outside world under the philosophy it calls ''juche,'' or
self-reliance.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Challenger in Crunch  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE LeBLANC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- For the first time in nearly four decades in
offices, Sen. Edward Kennedy could find himself without a
Republican opponent in November.
</P>
<P>
   GOP hopeful Jack E. Robinson had until 5 p.m. Tuesday to turn in
10,000 signatures needed to get his name on the ballot. As of
mid-afternoon, he had submitted only about 4,300.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the first time the Republican Party has failed to
field a candidate in a Senate race in Massachusetts since senators
were first elected by popular vote in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson -- a young black Republican and former Eastern Airlines
executive now running a cellular phone business -- is also
struggling to regain the backing of his party's leaders, including
Gov. Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci and other top state Republicans withdrew their
endorsements in March after the 39-year-old political neophyte
released a detailed, and damaging, 11-page personal history. In it,
Robinson outlined a drunken driving arrest -- he was eventually
cleared -- and a relationship with a girlfriend who took out a
restraining order against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still think there's some pretty big questions he's left
unanswered,'' Cellucci said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson vowed to fight on without the help of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ''My own PR guy asked me, 'Are you still in the race?'''
Robinson said last month. ''I said, 'Yes, why wouldn't I be?' I
don't believe it's an impossible task.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Robinson has kept a low profile. He did not return
calls in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his popularity among Massachusetts voters, Kennedy has
faced a Republican foe in every campaign since he was first elected
to the Senate seat that had been held by his brother John F.
Kennedy. Each time -- in 1964, 1970, 1976, 1982, 1988 and 1994 --
Kennedy fended off those challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy faced his toughest re-election battle in 1994, against
wealthy Republican businessman Mitt Romney. Early polls showed the
two in a virtual tie, but Kennedy ended up winning, 58 percent to
41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A Kennedy aide declined comment on Robinson's challenge Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Robinson, Kennedy may not be alone on the November
ballot. Carla Howell, a candidate for the Libertarian Party, and
Philip Lawler, a candidate for the Constitution Party, are running.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Election Commission reports for the period between
January and March show Kennedy has more than $3.7 million on hand.
Robinson has so far lent his campaign $39,000 and spent all but
$600.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier GOP challenger, Plymouth County District Attorney
Michael Sullivan, bowed out of the race, citing satisfaction with
his current job and his desire to spend time with his four
school-age children.

<HEADLINE> Euro Higher After U.S. Stocks Drop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro rose against the dollar on Tuesday as
traders bid up the price of the single European currency amid a
broad selloff in the U.S. stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 90.69 cents, up
from 89.70 cents late Monday. The slight push upward moved the euro
a full two cents above the record low of 88.45 cents it reached on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has suffered against the dollar in recent weeks as the
U.S. economy has shown no signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts believe Tuesday's optimism could quickly sour.
European Central Bank officials and other European financial
leaders are expected to provide little support to the flagging euro
at meetings scheduled to begin on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading Monday, the dollar was quoted at 109.45
Japanese yen, up from 109.03. The dollar also was quoted at 1.7168
Swiss francs, down from 1.7276, and 1.4913 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.4917.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.1566 German
marks, down from 2.1803; 7.2329 French francs, down from 7.3124;
and 2,134.92 Italian lire, down from 2,158.49.
</P>
<P>
   The British pound rose to $1.5332 from $1.5321.

<HEADLINE> Vieques Protesters Mull Strategy  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA VILLERRAEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rico Independence Party
leader Ruben Berrios returned to Vieques on Tuesday to resume a
civil disobedience campaign intended to stop Navy bombing on the
island, which resumed Monday after more than a year's hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   Berrios was met by a small group of fellow protesters and
reporters as he arrived at the airport on Vieques, a small island
off Puerto Rico's mainland. He had camped on the Navy range here
for nearly a year, helping spearhead the protests before he and 223
others were removed during a federal raid that began last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm asking the people of Vieques and Puerto Rico to stay calm,
vigilant but calm,'' said Berrios, who had been taken to the
mainland during the raid.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Navy warplanes dropped ''dummy'' bombs -- bombs with no live
munitions -- at the training ground Monday, fulfilling a Navy pledge
to resume operations despite protesters' claims that some
colleagues were still on the range. The Navy says it knows of no
holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters had occupied the Navy's Atlantic fleet range on
Vieques since April 1999, when civilian security guard David Sanes
Rodriguez was killed by stray bombs. The protesters say decades of
bombing have harmed their health, stunted tourism, harmed
endangered species and destroyed fishing grounds, coral reefs and
mangroves.
</P>
<P>
   But the Navy says Vieques is vital to national security because
it is the only place where the Atlantic Fleet can hold simultaneous
air, land and sea training. President Clinton and Puerto Rican Gov.
Pedro Rossello agreed in January to let the Navy resume limited
training with ''dummy'' bombs and, in exchange, let Vieques
residents vote -- probably next year -- on whether the Navy should
leave by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Berrios refused to say Tuesday how he would continue his
protest. While all protesters removed from the range were released
without charge, anyone who re-enters the compound faces tough
penalties: up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine under an
order issued by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard ships patrolled off Vieques Tuesday and U.S. Marines
guarded the range's perimeter. About 50 Puerto Rican police
officers protected the gates to the range's Camp Garcia. Nearby,
protesters erected a new tent camp outside Navy property.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques' fishermen, many of whom were detained last week,
claimed Tuesday that a three-mile-wide no-entry zone around the
range was preventing them from reaching fishing grounds and lobster
traps. The zone is being enforced by the Coast Guard. Some
fishermen said they might try to run the blockade on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard ships have turned away at least 56 vessels since the
blockade was imposed Thursday, according to the Joint Information
Center at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, which administers the
Vieques range.

<HEADLINE> Chief Speaks on Anti-Missile Defense  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton may decide as early as this
summer whether to give a green light to constructing a national
missile defense, but the Air Force general leading the project said
Tuesday it would take four more years of testing before he would
feel confident it will work.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish said the development of a national
missile defense -- designed to shoot down a small number of missiles
fired from North Korea or the Middle East -- is on the right track.
He expressed confidence that the next flight test of an interceptor
rocket, scheduled for June, will be a success.
</P>
<P>
   But Kadish, who directs the Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization, said there are so many technological milestones yet
to be met that he would not be confident about its effectiveness
until production-model rocket boosters and other advanced equipment
are tested in 2004. Not until that stage will the testing involve
people who would actually be operating a deployed system.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket booster to be used in the June test is a prototype.
The production model will not be ready until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're walking before we run,'' Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   The June test is considered critical -- at much from a political
as a technological standpoint -- because it probably will be the
last attempted intercept before Clinton decides whether to push
forward with building the missile defense system. If Clinton leaves
the decision to his successor, the Pentagon would be unable to meet
its self-imposed deadline of having a missile defense operating by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   That date coincides with the Pentagon's estimate of when North
Korea may have an initial capability to strike U.S. territory with
a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable is severely constrained because, in order to meet
the 2005 target, construction on a new radar in the Aleutian
Islands would have to begin next April, Kadish said in an interview
with Pentagon reporters. Contracts for constructing the radar could
not be awarded until Clinton gives his go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish said he visited Shemya Island in the Aleutians, where the
X-band radar is to be built, last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have a challenge to build that radar on this
island,'' he said, not because of technology but because of the
wind-swept island's exceptionally short construction season.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish said experts had solved the problem that caused the last
missile intercept test to fail in January -- a plumbing problem that
caused a malfunction in sensitive devices aboard the missile
interceptor that enable it to ''see'' its target against the cold
background of space.
</P>
<P>
   ''That particular problem, I think -- barring a real stupid
mistake -- is under control,'' Kadish said. ''If we don't have one
of those glitches, we think the design we have will be successful
on the next flight test.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the three-star general said he worried that another
seemingly minor problem could crop up at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things I worry about a lot ... is that it's that
one wire that shakes loose in the system that prevents the test
from being successful, or it's that plug or the water molecule in
the plumbing system that gets you. It doesn't have to do with the
fundamental design so much as the complexity of the stuff we're
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts believe that if the June test fails to intercept
its target, Clinton will put off a deployment decision. Defense
Secretary William Cohen is scheduled to make his recommendation to
Clinton this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-missile system is designed to provide protection for
all 50 states against a ballistic missile attack from a ''rogue''
nation. A base with 20 interceptor rockets would be built in Alaska
-- most likely at Fort Greely near Fairbanks -- along with the X-band
radar on Shemya Island. By 2007, under the current schedule, the
system would be expanded to 100 interceptor rockets. The Pentagon
estimates the cost at $30 billion.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Trip Disappoints Vatican  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- A Vatican delegation to Vietnam made no major
breakthroughs, with officials proving cold to key proposals such as
establishing diplomatic relations, the Vatican missionary news
service reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese officials told the delegation they first wanted to
see ''more good will on the part of the Vatican,'' Fides said.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignors Celestino Migliore of the Vatican Secretary of State
and Barnaba Phuong visited Hanoi from May 2 to Saturday to try to
improve relations with communist-led Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Dealings have been tense over Hanoi's insistence that it have
final say over religious appointments.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation had hoped to work out an agreement on
appointments of new bishops for at least three vacant diocese, as
well as for others whose bishops are too old and sick, Fides said.
It indicated the delegation left unsatisfied on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few encouraging moments was a visit to a cathedral in
the south, where thousands of faithful turned out, Fides said.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam's 76 million people are predominantly Buddhist, although
the 8 million Catholics constitute the largest Catholic community
in Southeast Asia outside the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Fides said the Vatican has been working for at least six years
to encourage aid to Vietnam, one of the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Pope John Paul II gave $100,000 for flood victims
there -- three times the amount he usually gives for emergencies.

<HEADLINE> Golfer loses sex discrimination case  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A golfer who claimed she suffered sex
discrimination at the ritzy Westchester Country Club for 17 years
waited too long to file her lawsuit, a state human rights judge
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge who issued the decision was not the judge who
heard the case, and the plaintiff's lawyer is crying foul.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Administrative Law Judge James T. King agreed that Nancy
Saunders had been discriminated against ''solely because of her
gender,'' but said she would have had to sue within a year after
becoming aware of it -- by 1986 at the latest. Saunders sued in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also found that state human rights laws did not apply
to the club anyway before 1994 because it was ''distinctly
private.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders' lawyer, Susan Slavin, said, ''Something's wrong here.
Where's the judge who tried the case? This is an absolutely
devastating decision, it is a tragedy and it bears no resemblance
to what took place at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge who conducted the hearings last fall, Denise
Washington, was dismissed in January. She told The Journal News
last month that she was fired because she testified in federal
court that the human rights division needed 25 to 30 more judges to
cut into a six-year backlog of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Ellison, spokeswoman for the Human Rights Division, said
it is ''within our authority and jurisdiction'' to assign a new
judge to a case.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders, 50, testified at the hearings that from the time she
joined the club in Harrison in 1982, she was barred, as a woman,
from the club's prestigious West Course for long stretches of time
each Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. She also could not get
into the Men's Grill, which she said cost her business
opportunities. And when she married a fellow member, she claimed,
the club ended her membership on the ground that the husband is
always the member.
</P>
<P>
   The club now charges $45,000 for initiation fees and $5,500 a
year for dues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed because I still believe in this and I know
what happened,'' said Saunders, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., and
returned a call after completing 18 holes Tuesday as part of the
club's women's team.
</P>
<P>
   In the decision -- actually a recommendation to state Human
Rights Commissioner Jerome Blue -- King said Saunders should have
filed her suit within a year of joining the club or within a year
of when the club allegedly terminated her membership in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that although the club is the host for the PGA
Tour's Buick Classic, it is not ''a place of public accommodation''
that would have been subject to the human rights law before 1994,
the period covered by the suit.
</P>
<P>
   King also ruled that Saunders' claim of retaliation by the club
against her husband was not proven.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Miller, president of the club, said the club ''does not
discriminate against people by gender, race, religion or in any
other manner, and I am pleased that the state Division of Human
Rights has ruled in our favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Slavin said she would object to the recommendations within the
21 days provided and appeal the case if the commissioner accepted
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision was not rendered by a judge who sat and observed
the demeanor of the witnesses and the credibility of the
witnesses,'' she said. ''How did he decide? From a record? You
can't tell from a cold record whether somebody is truthful. ...
Judge Washington gave us every indication during trial that she was
favorably persuaded. So we obviously think this is a travesty.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Presidents Rally About China Trade  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The cause was trade with China, and, in a rare
display of Washington fellowship, it brought together two past
presidents, the present-day president and one applicant for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Ford crossed his legs and settled back in his chair.
Jimmy Carter took long blinks to rest his eyes under the bright
lights. Bill Clinton, junior member of this club, jotted notes on
his speech text.
</P>
<P>
   Before them Tuesday was an assemblage of luminaries rallying
around Clinton's proposal to establish permanent normal trade with
China, facing opposition from many of his fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The session was unusual. Clinton noted that ''it unites Henry
Kissinger, Andrew Young and Jesse Ventura -- and not at a wrestling
match.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford compared this trade battle to a 1949 vote that he, John F.
Kennedy and Richard Nixon cast in Congress to help Harry Truman
''undo the tragedy of the high-tariff, protectionist trade
policies'' that fed into the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Carter reminisced about secret 1979 negotiations with
then-Chinese Premier Deng Xiaoping, recalling his own passion for
human rights and his hopes for ''the well-being of the American
worker'' in a more open trade environment.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Clinton, president longer than the other two combined,
making his case in the most colloquial manner.
</P>
<P>
   ''This agreement has become like fly paper for the accumulated
frustrations people have about things in the world,'' Clinton said.
''If the Congress votes against it, they will be kicking themselves
in the rear 10 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   So near, but yet so far, sat Vice President Al Gore. Grouped
across the stage with Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright,
James Baker and Henry Kissinger, Gore could only gaze over at the
fraternity of presidents he is campaigning to join.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's session was the first time Carter, Clinton and Ford
have been together at the White House since Sept. 14, 1993, when
they united in support of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
They traveled together aboard Air Force One to the funeral of King
Hussein of Jordan in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush attended both those events but skipped Tuesday's
gathering due to a scheduling conflict. Ronald Reagan, suffering
from Alzheimer's, also did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ford's first visit to the White House this year. He came
last October to receive the Congressional Gold Medal. Carter, who
received his medal from Clinton in Atlanta last year, stopped by
last month to show his grandchildren where he used to live. He
wandered over to the West Wing again Tuesday, along with Clinton's
former chief of staff, Leon Panetta, and others.
</P>
<P>
   The three presidents entered the East Room in lockstep. Just as
he does in politics, Clinton claimed the middle, Carter on his left
and Ford on his right. On stage it was Carter in the middle,
leaning over now and then to lend Clinton an ear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell you, I was very, very proud that I have been able to
serve this country with all three of these gentlemen,'' said Young.
He was Carter's United Nations ambassador, served in Congress with
Ford and works with Clinton through the Southern Africa Enterprise
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Ford provided a moment of warmth, introducing Carter, who
defeated him in 1976, as ''a very dear and good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton played the fawning admirer, saying that
having so many political heavyweights in the room was ''just
profoundly humbling for me.'' He covered his face and chortled with
laughter as Kissinger joked that many in the room ''could not even
be charitably described as colleagues,'' while Ford and Carter
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was so caught up in the moment that at the end, he sped
off from Ford and Carter to greet Kissinger and Baker. Then he
sheepishly returned to the microphone to invite his guests to drop
by the Blue Room, where he, Ford and Carter were gathering to
welcome the guests.
</P>
<P>
   ''I forgot my social responsibilities here,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Coalition: School construction should help revitalize cities  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Legislation creating a statewide school
construction program lacks the vision to revitalize decaying
cities, a new coalition that advocates urban renewal said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It should be rewritten, members said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the latest in the ongoing struggle over how to structure
the largest school construction program in New Jersey's history.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, just now jumping into the fray after more than a
year of wrangling over the measure, is asking the Legislature to
incorporate provisions designed to help revitalize New Jersey's
ailing cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for Our Children's Schools, which includes
community organizations, business leaders and child advocates,
wants lawmakers to scrap a plan to have a central state agency
oversee the jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, group members say districts, municipalities and
community organizations should control the projects, with state
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   That would allow towns to design schools that meet the
community's needs and give jobs to local people, said Alan Mallach,
of the Affordable Housing Network of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition members also want the legislation to allow districts
to create ''community schools'' that have everything from health
clinics to meeting rooms for community groups. They also want to
tie school construction to community projects, such as housing
development, to revitalize neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   They say the current measure misses a huge opportunity to
leverage funds that could fix blighted neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we do this right, our children, our communities and our
state will benefit,'' said Diane Sterner, executive director of the
Affordable Housing Network of New Jersey. ''If we don't, the chance
might never come again.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't have strong schools in crumbling cities,'' added Tom
O'Neill, director of the Partnership New Jersey, a coalition of
major New Jersey companies.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers have already rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Senate Education Committee passed a bill that
eliminated a provision that would have required school districts to
work with municipal governments to decide whether redevelopment
efforts could be incorporated into school construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   As part of continuing negotiations, the senators scaled that
back to encourage economic development around new schools in six
unidentified pilot cities.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have insisted that a state agency oversee the
construction in 30 of New Jersey's poorest districts because, under
the Senate version of the bill, the state would pay the entire cost
of construction in those districts. Suburban districts would get at
least 40 percent of their construction costs paid by the state,
under the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem, sponsor of the Assembly
version of the measure, has reservations about the community
development idea, according to his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's afraid that proponents of community development are
trying to expand the scope of the program beyond building
schools,'' said Chuck Leitgeb. ''And the cost of this program, it
appears, is growing weekly.''
</P>
<P>
   Leitgeb said the speaker has asked the nonpartisan Office of
Legislative Services to explore the possibility of putting a cap on
the entire program, which is now estimated to cost $12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   When the construction program was first proposed a couple of
years ago, state officials estimated it would cost about $6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really need to start taking a step back and see what we can
reasonably afford,'' said Leitgeb. ''The goal was to build schools,
but there was only so much money to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   The state is under court order to fix crumbling schools in 30 of
New Jersey's poorest school districts. Gov. Christie Whitman and
lawmakers also have promised to help the rest of New Jersey's
school districts fix old schools or build new ones.

   Cisco Earnings Top Expectations
</P>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Profits for Internet equipment provider
Cisco Systems Inc. topped Wall Street expectations for the ninth
consecutive quarter, as companies snapped up its equipment for
routing Web and data traffic. For the three months ended April 29,
the company reported net income of $662 million, or 9 cents per
share, up from $636 million, or 9 cents per share, in the year-ago
period. The numbers include $488 million in research and
development write-offs as well as other one-time items. Excluding
those numbers, Cisco earned $1.03 billion, or 14 cents a share.

   BMW Agrees To Sell Rover Car Group
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A British consortium clinched a deal Tuesday to
take over the money-losing Rover car business from Germany's BMW
and save thousands of jobs in Britain. The successful bid by the
Phoenix consortium, led by former Rover chief executive John
Towers, staves off the closure of the country's largest car
factory. For BMW, the sale ends a costly and embarrassing foray
into the mainstream auto market. The luxury carmaker invested $4
billion in a failed, six-year effort to restore Rover to
profitability.

   FCC Close To Deciding Cable Deal
</P>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission is
nearing a decision on a merger that would position telephone giant
AT&AMP;T as the nation's top cable TV company, officials said today.
The proposed deal between AT&AMP;T and MediaOne has raised concerns at
the agency about how much control over programming the combined
entity would be able to exercise. For that reason, FCC staff have
proposed actions the companies could take to complete the deal,
while complying with federal limits on how many cable households
one entity can reach.

   CBS Rejects Christian Dot-Com Ads
</P>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Christian e-tailer iBelieve.com
wanted to advertise on the high-profile network miniseries
''Jesus,'' but CBS rejected the ads on the grounds that their
content is too similar to the program and might confuse viewers.
The two-part TV program begins Sunday night. At the same time, the
Web merchant says it is being courted by www.CBS.com to sponsor
online sites for ''Jesus'' and the ''Touched by an Angel'' series.
CBS said there is nothing inconsistent about one CBS division
rejecting advertising while another pursued it.

   Bestfoods To Market Soymilk
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Bestfoods this week plans to introduce a new
soymilk for the U.S. market. Other companies that have jumped into
the soy business include PepsiCo Inc.'s, Kellogg Co., Kraft Foods
Inc., H.J. Heinz Co. and the nation's two biggest dairy processors,
Dean Foods Co. and Suiza Foods Corp. Soy beverage sales reached
$126 million for the year, a 60 percent increase. Analysts expect
the soy market to continue growing, in part because the government
is allowing soy products to claim that soy protein lowers blood
cholesterol levels.

   Wal-Mart 1Q Profits Rise
</P>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s first-quarter earnings
rose sharply from a year ago, and the world's biggest retailer said
it expects to maintain healthy sales and profit growth for the
remainder of the year. The chain reported today that it earned
$1.326 billion, or 30 cents a share, for the quarter ended April
30, compared with $916 million, or 20 cents a share, a year ago.
Sales for the quarter totaled $42.99 billion, up from $34.71
billion a year ago. Shares in Wal-Mart closed up | to 53.

   Bill Would Allow Tax-Free PC Gifts
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Workers who take advantage of their employer's
gift of a free computer or cut-rate Internet access would not face
income tax consequences under legislation introduced in the House.
The legislation developed after numerous tax experts said the
Internal Revenue Service would probably take its cut of the free
computers being offered this year to an estimated 600,000 workers
at Ford Motor Co., American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Intel
Corp. Because the giveaways are so new, the IRS hasn't announced a
policy on whether they count as income subject to tax.

same period last year. BP Amoco completed its acquisition of
Atlantic Richfield Co. in April. Operating profit for exploration

to take adequate steps in terms of human rights, democracy and
labor standards. ''But ... a negative vote ... will be a serious
setback and impediment for the further democratization, freedom and
human rights in China,'' Carter said.

   Student Computer Privacy Debated

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposal before Congress would require that
public elementary and secondary schools get parents' written
consent before collecting information from pupils for commercial
purposes. The bill's sponsors cited students keeping journals for a
marketing survey and a technology firm that provided schools with
free computers and Internet access, but monitored students' online
activity. The Parent Teacher Association has endorsed the student
privacy proposal, but groups representing school administrators and
school board members have not.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Testifies in Shooting Trial  </HEADLINE>
By TIM MOLLOY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A court psychiatrist testified Tuesday that a
man accused of killing five people in a racially motivated shooting
spree is incompetent to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christine Martone said Richard Baumhammers, 34, is a
paranoid schizophrenic who hears voices, is delusional and suffers
other mental problems. She said Baumhammers seemed so detached in
two interviews last week that she thought he would not be able to
help his lawyers in his own defense.
</P>
<P>
   Allegheny County Judge Lawrence O'Toole said he would rule on
whether Baumhammers is competent to stand trial after Deputy
District Attorney Ed Borkowski reviews a report by another court
doctor who also interviewed Baumhammers.
</P>
<P>
   Martone said the other report, by Dr. Sabato Stile, supports her
findings.
</P>
<P>
   If Baumhammers is found incompetent to stand trial, he would be
treated at a hospital until he is deemed competent. If he was never
deemed competent, Baumhammers would remain hospitalized
indefinitely, said his attorney, William Difenderfer.
</P>
<P>
   Borkowski questioned Martone, who was ordered to examine
Baumhammers by the judge, on whether she was sure Baumhammers was
not faking his symptoms to avoid a trial. She said she was.
</P>
<P>
   He also pressed her on whether it would be helpful for her to
review Baumhammers' mental health records from two previous periods
when he was hospitalized for treatment. She said it would not,
because Baumhammers' past mental state was irrelevant as to whether
he is competent to assist in his own defense now.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Baumhammers, the white son of Latvian immigrants,
targeted ethnic and religious minorities in the April 28 shooting
spree in suburban Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Those killed were a Jewish woman, an Indian man, a Chinese man,
a Vietnamese man and a black man. Baumhammers is also accused of
wounding a second Indian man.

<HEADLINE> Witness says she saw man kill boy witness, mother  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A courtroom was filled with the sound
of sobs Tuesday as a woman described the murders of 8-year-old
Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''They was trying to get away. They was running up the stairs,''
Josephine Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a gunshot.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Her son was calling out, 'Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee is the prosecution's star witness in the murder trial of
Russell Peeler, who is accused of plotting the killings of B.J. and
his mother, Karen Clarke, to stop the boy from testifying against
him in an earlier murder.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. had witnessed a 1997 driveby shooting in which Peeler had
allegedly tried to kill Clarke's fiance, Rudolph Snead Jr. When
Snead was shot to death in a Bridgeport barber shop eight months
later, B.J. agreed to testify against Peeler.
</P>
<P>
   As Lee described the boy's anguished cries for help, several
people in the courtroom cried. A female relative of Clarke's
yelled, ''Oh, God,'' then left the courtroom sobbing. Lee, still
seated in the witness chair, also began to cry, and rubbed her face
with a tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who lived across the street from B.J. and his mother, said
she was the lookout and watched as Peeler's brother, Adrian, gunned
down the mother and son in their Bridgeport duplex on Jan. 7, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   She also told the jury she overheard the two brothers planning
the killings the day before the murders.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee's testimony was challenged by Russell Peeler's defense
attorneys, who grilled her about the numerous and varied accounts
she has given to police and prosecutors over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lee admitted under cross-examination that she had lied numerous
times in her first three statements to police.
</P>
<P>
   But while she was testifying, Lee remained composed, even feisty
at times, as she insisted she was now being truthful.
</P>
<P>
   Lee stuck closely to a videotaped deposition she gave in
November, when she described acting as a lookout and an eyewitness
to the murders.
</P>
<P>
   She said that on the day before the killings, Russell and Adrian
were in her kitchen, cooking crack cocaine and talking about B.J.
and his mother.
</P>
<P>
   She said Russell Peeler first asked her if she would kill the
mother and son, and when she refused, turned to his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told Adrian, 'I want you to do me a favor and kill the lady
and the little boy across the street,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Adrian said, 'I'll take care of it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said she agreed to page Russell Peeler when Clarke arrived
home. In return, Russell gave her a handful of crack, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Jan. 7, 1999, Lee paged Russell when Clarke and
her son arrived home from grocery shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said Adrian showed up at her house a short time later
carrying a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said when she knocked on Clarke's door, Clarke cracked it
open.
</P>
<P>
   ''Adrian pushed (himself) in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said she watched as Adrian chased B.J. and his mother. She
said she heard a gunshot as they ran up the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   After B.J. called over and over again for his mother, Lee said
she heard Adrian talking to Clarke in her bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard Adrian say something about her fiance ... about how
her son was a witness to some kind of shooting,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she heard another shot from the bedroom. The boy, she
said, ''was still hollering out for his mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said Adrian then came out of the bedroom and shot the boy in
the head.
</P>
<P>
   During three hours of cross-examination, Peeler's lawyer,
William Koch, went after Lee's testimony -- detail by detail.
</P>
<P>
   Koch asked Lee to explain why Clarke's blood was found on
grocery bags near the front door if, as she claims, the first shot
was not fired until Adrian was chasing Clarke and her son up the
stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't tell you. I don't know,'' replied Clarke. ''It
happened so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch also asked Lee about how she was treated by police and
prosecutors once she told them in March 1999 that Russell and
Adrian Peeler were involved in the killings. She said she was put
up in a hotel, given pocket money and sent to a drug detoxification
program on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Lee answered matter-of-factly when asked about how she was
treated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ate good, I slept good, and that was that,'' she said,
shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder, received
a plea bargain in which she agreed to testify against the Peelers
and the state agreed to recommend a sentence of no more than seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Peeler, who has also been charged with murder, is
scheduled to go on trial once his brother's trial is completed.
Both brothers face the possibility of the death penalty if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The killings sparked a public outcry and led to an overhaul of
the state's witness protection program.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Shell Congo Airport  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISANGANI, Congo (AP) -- Ugandan shells rained down on Rwandan
positions and neither side's forces made a move to leave this Congo
port city Tuesday, a day after both Uganda and Rwanda agreed to
withdraw their troops.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers from both armies dug in for more fighting in Kisangani,
the city where they waged a ferocious four-day artillery battle
last August that left hundreds dead.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan army commanders said their emplacements at Bangoka
airport, 10 miles northeast of Kisangani, received 70 mortar shells
from the direction of the Ugandan military base before dawn
Tuesday. There were no casualties, and Ugandan military officials
refused comment or access to their positions.
</P>
<P>
   The shelling was the latest development in the conflict here,
which is an offshoot of Congo's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda and Rwanda each back a different group of rebels, both of
which are opposed to Congolese President Laurent Kabila. Both
countries' troops are deployed in Kisangani in support of the
rebels, and both view the city, with its two decaying airports, as
a strategic rear base for their units deployed elsewhere in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5,500 U.N. troops are supposed to deploy in Congo as part
of the peace process to end the 22-month civil war in which
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia are entangled in addition to Rwanda
and Uganda. On Monday, a U.N. Security Council team led by U.S.
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke helped mediate an agreement between
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul
Kagame, to hand control of Kisangani, Congo's third-largest city,
over to a U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Holbrooke's prediction that the withdrawal would begin
''as soon as possible,'' there was little sign on the rain-soaked
ground of Kisangani that either the Ugandans or the Rwandans were
preparing to depart. On the contrary, the Rwandans accused Ugandans
of deploying at least 3,500 troops in the past week against an
estimated 1,000 Rwandans.
</P>
<P>
   After last summer's fighting, the two forces agreed to
demilitarize the city and organize joint patrols, but a lack of
trust prevented it. The fighting flared up Friday, when a clash
between the Rwandan and Ugandan armies left 28 civilians dead and
159 wounded, according to medical teams that toured the city later.
The worst of the fighting ended Saturday after both presidents
ordered a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said Tuesday that the United Nations intends to
send more military observers to Kisangani, but gave no time frame
for when they would be deployed. There are now four U.N. military
observers stationed here.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Basketball Star Mourned  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE VOGT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- In an all-too-familiar ritual for this
community, more than 2,000 people attended the funeral Tuesday of a
Columbine High School basketball star who hanged himself last week.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Barnes was the fourth Columbine student or relative to die
since last year's deadly shooting rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ''A community that is used to shock is in shock once again,''
said the Rev. Don Marxhausen of St. Philip Lutheran Church. ''A
principal, a faculty, a student body has to again open up the deep
parts of themselves to find resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, 17, was remembered during the 90-minute service at St.
Frances Cabrini Roman Catholic Parish for his kindness, generosity
and infectious laugh and smile.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was always really kind to people he didn't know. Even
though he was a star athlete, he didn't act like it,'' said Dan
Opher, a senior at nearby Chatfield High School. Opher had to leave
the service early because it was too painful.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes saw a teacher critically wounded and lost one of his best
friends in the April 20, 1999, shooting at Columbine High School.
Twelve students and a teacher were killed. The student gunmen than
turned the weapons on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes hanged himself in his garage Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the church, mourners passed by a tribute of flowers,
photographs and Barnes' framed basketball jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Filipiak, a Columbine junior, said the service was both sad
and hopeful. ''Every time I saw him he was smiling,'' Filipiak
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the attack, the Columbine community has been beset by
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of Anne-Marie Hochhalter, a student paralyzed in the
shooting, walked into a pawnshop in October, asked to see a gun,
loaded it and shot herself to death. And on Valentine's day, two
Columbine sweethearts were shot to death in a sandwich shop.

<HEADLINE> Auditors: Pentagon Books Way Off  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite some recent improvements, the
Pentagon's bookkeeping remains so convoluted and primitive that
assets worth billions of dollars cannot be properly accounted for,
congressional auditors said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''To date, no major part of Department of Defense has yet been
able to pass the test of an independent audit,'' said a report by
the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials admitted outdated business practices and
flawed systems are rife within the agency but said it would take
some years more to get all the agency's books in order.
</P>
<P>
   ''This continues to be one of my highest priorities,'' Pentagon
Comptroller William Lynn told a House Government Reform
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Steinhoff, the GAO's assistant comptroller general, told
the panel the Pentagon ''does not know the actual amount and value
of inventory for which it is responsible.'' He put the estimate at
$1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the GAO's detailed criticisms:
</P>
<P>
   --Around 58 percent of the materiel the Pentagon has in its
possession -- $36.9 billion worth of items -- it does not need.
</P>
<P>
   --A $600 billion Pentagon inventory of weapons systems and other
''national defense assets'' failed to include $5.7 billion in Army
communications equipment, $7.6 billion in Navy aircraft engines and
about $7 billion in Air Force electronic systems pods that attach
to warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   --The Navy lost track of $3 billion in equipment and other items
over a three-year period, but most of the items the Navy reported
as lost were delivered, and there ''was no evidence of theft in the
shipments we reviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the Government Reform
subcommittee on government management, information and technology,
said the Pentagon's ''financial information is simply not
reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report follows one in March by the office of the Defense
Department's inspector general that also concluded the Pentagon's
books were so messed up they couldn't be audited.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to believe that the department remains a few years
away from being able to achieve favorable audit opinions on most
major financial statements,'' Robert Lieberman, an assistant
Pentagon inspector general, told Tuesday's congressional hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The department is making progress,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton thanks Pataki for leadership on ballistic fingerprints  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Saying that gun control should be a bipartisan
issue, Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday saluted
Republican Gov. George Pataki for his leadership on ballistic
fingerprinting.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also endorsed the Million Mom March, an anti-gun
protest in Washington on Sunday, Mother's Day, that she will
attend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I applaud Gov. Pataki here in this state who showed real
leadership in proposing a state-based ballistics program,'' she
said in a speech in Manhattan to the Newspaper Association of
America. ''I think it is something that needs to be done on the
national level. Gun safety measures should be a bipartisan
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Republican opponent in the Senate race, New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, is also a strong proponent of gun control
and has endorsed Pataki's ballistic fingerprinting proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Every gun leaves unique traces on bullets, and Pataki's proposal
would require that a sample ballistics test be performed on every
weapon sold in the state to create a database for tracing guns used
in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also endorsed a proposal by Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., to require a license of anyone buying a handgun and
create a national registry of every new handgun sold in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In championing Sunday's march, Clinton said: ''Ordinary
citizens, women, who just finally had enough, are organizing and
marching for the changes they think would make their jobs as
mothers easier to do ... I will be one mom who will be proud to
march with all of the others.''

<HEADLINE> Refugees Flee Sierre Leone Town  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- United Nations peacekeepers,
followed by frightened refugees, have retreated from a key village
outside this West African capital, U.N. officials said Tuesday,
while regional leaders met in Nigeria in an effort to defuse the
week-old crisis threatening to push Sierra Leone once again into
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers withdrew from Masiaka, 45 miles east of
Freetown, on Monday after exchanging gunfire with unknown attackers
and running out of ammunition, U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said.
Word of the retreat did not reach Freetown for more than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   While rebels of the Revolutionary United Front are believed to
be in the region, it was unclear if they were responsible.
Helicopter reconnaissance showed the city was completely empty
Tuesday afternoon, Wimhurst said, but added: ''Freetown is not
going to fall to the RUF.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of refugees from the Masiaka area had reached the edge
of Freetown by Tuesday afternoon, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In this seaside city, word of the fighting broadcast over the
radio quickly spread fear through the city after what had been a
peaceful Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are so worried ... that we heard that the rebels had
attacked Masiaka and Masiaka is so close to the city,'' said Edward
Moseray, a civil servant.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the country's rebel leader, Foday Sankoh,
added to the gloom. He had been under U.N. guard before Monday's
shooting outside his Freetown home. The rumor mill had Sankoh
anywhere from the Sierra Leonean jungle to an army safehouse, but
U.N. officials said they did not know where he was.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are anxious to find a way to contact him,'' Wimhurst told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Sierra Leone has become increasingly chaotic
since a Nigerian-led regional intervention force pulled out last
week. Since then, clashes have broken out intermittently between
peacekeepers and rebels and some 500 peacekeepers are being held
hostage by the RUF. At least one peacekeeper is believed to be
dead.
</P>
<P>
   In Abuja, Nigeria, presidents from around the region were
meeting to try to defuse the crisis. While it was unclear how many
leaders had made it to the mini-summit, it was planned to include
the presidents of Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, Liberia and
Guinea, among others.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the United States had sent a ''fact-finding'' team
from U.S. European Command to Nigeria on Monday to assess what help
the U.S. military might provide if Nigeria or other African nations
decide to augment their peacekeeping role in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Press reports in Nigeria say that country is considering sending
soldiers back to Sierra Leone, perhaps as a fighting force that
would not operate under the peacekeepers' limited mandate.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. has also said the U.S. Air Force was prepared to fly in
a battalion of U.N. peacekeepers from Bangladesh -- roughly 700 to
800 soldiers -- in coming days. The United Nations wants to speed up
deployment of that battalion and two others scheduled to arrive by
mid-July, bringing the U.N. force up to its full strength of
11,100.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a U.N. spokesman said the three remaining
battalions appear ready to deploy by next week but so far only the
Bangladeshi contingent has air transport.
</P>
<P>
   British helicopters, meanwhile, continued swooping into Freetown
on Tuesday, ferrying out frightened Britons.
</P>
<P>
   In London, a Ministry of Defense spokeswoman said about 320
British, European Union and Commonwealth citizens had been
evacuated so far. They were flown to Sierra Leone's main airport
and then most were taken by airplane to Dakar, the capital of
Senegal, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, the crowds of evacuees had thinned but some were
still waiting to be flown from a helipad near the now heavily
militarized Mammy Yoko hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations late Monday began evacuating some of its 266
nonessential civilian employees. Another 55 were staying in
Freetown, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the evacuations and Monday's clashes, the streets of
this seaside capital were calm Tuesday, with many stores open and
people moving about freely.
</P>
<P>
   At least four demonstrators were gunned down by rebels Monday
when thousands of rock-throwing marchers headed for Sankoh's house,
though doctors at Freetown's main hospital said 20 people had been
killed over the past night, and 54 more had gunshot wounds. It
wasn't clear, though, how many had been killed in the initial
gunfire and how many in other incidents. At least some of those
killed are believed to be rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leonean army soldiers, who under a July peace plan are
supposed to be disarmed, and fighters from the pro-government
Kamajor militia, fought the rebels for hours at Sankoh's home after
the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings in Freetown, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
described Sierra Leone's peace process as being in ''deep
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Miyet, the head of U.N. peacekeeping operations, arrived
in Freetown on Monday night and was meeting U.N. soldiers and
officials to assess the situation and ''to demonstrate to ... the
world that we're determined to put the peace process back on
track,'' Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone, among the world's poorest countries despite vast
diamond resources, was brutalized during eight years of civil war,
which ended with a peace accord last July that created a
power-sharing government. In principle, that deal included the
rebels and Sankoh, whose forces killed and maimed thousands during
the war.

<HEADLINE> S.F. Fed Chief Defends Rate Hikes  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Predictions that the Federal Reserve Bank
may raise interest rates more aggressively are not out of character
with the agency's cautionary approach, said regional Fed chief
Robert T. Parry.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've moved cautiously but that doesn't mean that we
only have a single note to play. ... In addition, I'm not sure I
would necessarily consider a second note as being inconsistent with
caution,'' Parry told the Northern California Financial Planning
Conference meeting in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
San Francisco would not indicate Tuesday which direction the Fed
might be leaning when it meets next week. ''I can't say where we'll
end up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe the Fed will raise interest rates at the
May 16 meeting, but it was unclear if the panel would stray from
recent increases of one-quarter point, or be more aggressive, going
up to a half point.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, the Fed has raised interest rates five times in
quarter-point increments in an effort to curb inflation in the
midst of a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of higher interest rates was fanned by the announcement
last week that the employment rate had hit a 30-year low of 3.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   While strong job and wage growth is good for workers, economists
and members of the Fed worry that the combination could raise
inflation. They fear that employers scrambling to find scarce
workers will raise wages and benefits -- costs that could be passed
to consumers in higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the economy has exploded over the past
several years is because of productivity related to the advances in
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Parry, whose district includes nine states, said he believes
productivity could accelerate fast enough to push inflation down.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's not something I think we can count on,'' he said.
''So, even though it's clear that technological advances are
expanding the supply side of the economy, we still have to watch
for conditions that raise inflationary risks.''
</P>
<P>
   He outlined several of these potential risks, including
increased energy prices, tight labor markets, and the growth of
consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a question about how far the Fed will have to go in
terms of raising rates over the next two years, Parry said
''there's just too much uncertainty to predict what's going to
happen over the next 2 or 2{ years.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The real issue is whether we've done enough, and if we haven't
done enough, how much more will we have to do?'' he asked. ''No one
knows the answer to that question.''

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart 1Q Profits Rise  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK BARTELS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s first-quarter earnings
rose sharply from a year ago, and the world's biggest retailer said
it expects to maintain healthy sales and profit growth for the
remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bentonville, Ark.-based chain reported Tuesday that it
earned $1.326 billion, or 30 cents a share, for the quarter ended
April 30, compared with $916 million, or 20 cents a share, a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's results include a 4 cent charge for a change in the
company's accounting practices.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the quarter totaled $42.99 billion, up from $34.71
billion a year ago. Sales at stores open at least a year, an
industry gauge of performance, rose 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's results topped Wall Street analysts estimates of 28
cents a share. The company's stock rose 62{ cents to $53 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 15 percent in its Wal-Mart Stores division, which
includes its Supercenters that combine traditional discount stores
with supermarkets. Profits in the division gained 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Food sales were particular strong at its Supercenters,
increasing 36 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Its international division saw a 118 percent growth in sales and
profits more than doubled. The gains were largely attributed to its
acquisition last year of ASDA Group, the third-largest grocery
chain in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Its stores in Germany, however, continue to struggle. Wal-Mart
is spending heavily on distribution centers and remodeling of
stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Sam's Club warehouse division reported a 8.9 percent gain in
sales and a 10.5 percent rise in profits.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's strength in the first quarter came despite
cooler-than-normal weather through most of April, which dampened
sales at many retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wal-Mart was a little affected by it,'' said Kurt Barnard, who
runs the consulting firm Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper
Montclair, N.J. ''But for other retailers, it was a washout, a
rainout, a snowout.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward, Wal-Mart expects earnings and sales growth to
continue in the coming quarters.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call with analysts, David Glass, Wal-Mart's
former top executive who now head its board's executive committee,
said the chain does not sense a slowdown in consumer spending, even
though some Wall Street analysts and economists have said that
Americans will scale back their buying later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Historically, Wal-Mart has gained market share during those
periods. We position our assortment in a way that we limit our
upside potential in boom times but eliminate downside exposure to
the extent that we possibly can,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   The optimistic outlook from Wal-Mart caused many retail analysts
to raise their estimates for the coming quarters and full year.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, the company opened 32 Supercenters, seven
discount stores and two Sam's Club stores. It also opened 10
international stores in Britain, Brazil and China.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 30, Wal-Mart had 1,784 discount stores, 753
Supercenters and 465 Sam's Clubs. Internationally, Wal-Mart has
1,011 stores.

<HEADLINE> Nasty Tricks in Mexico's Election  </HEADLINE>
By LISA J. ADAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Two months ago, when Mexico's presidential
election campaign kicked into full gear, the country's 210 news
programs were devoting a fairly even amount of time to each of the
three main candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But by April, a shift had occurred: Suddenly the candidate of
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has held the
presidency for 71 years, was getting half the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The change came just as polls began showing opposition candidate
Vicente Fox closing in fast on ruling party candidate, Francisco
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ''From one month to another we see this sharp difference,'' said
Arturo Sanchez, president of the electoral institute's media
monitoring commission, which detected the shift.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why is this so alarming? Because we assumed that we had made
great advances over the elections of 1994 and 1997. ... We thought
that this presidential election was going to be different,''
Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral institute and its media monitoring are among
numerous reforms adopted over the past decade to try to clean up an
election system long marred by allegations the PRI bought votes,
stuffed ballot boxes, showered voters with gifts and manipulated
press coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Its monitoring showed that from mid-February to mid-March, radio
newscasts -- the major source of information for many Mexicans --
devoted about a third of their coverage to the ruling party. In the
following month, that percentage rose to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same period, the center-right National Action Party saw
coverage drop from 31 percent to 21 percent. Time devoted to the
center-left Democratic Revolution Party fell from 27 percent to 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The results ''show a clear change of politics on the part of the
media,'' said Jacqueline Peschard, a board member of the Federal
Electoral Institute. ''This is what is worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties claim government pressure is behind the
shift.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a damage-control operation the PRI is doing after its
candidate dropped suddenly in the polls,'' said Jesus Ramirez, an
analyst with the Democratic Revolution Party. ''The state controls
the media concessions ... and also government advertising, a strong
source of income for many media.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Fuentes, Labastida's director of international affairs,
denied any government meddling, and said increased coverage merely
reflects stepped-up campaigning by Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that all this hysteria has to do with the fact that
for the opposition, the only way that they can disqualify the PRI
is by saying we resorted to the practices of the past ... that the
PRI can only win because it is aided by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghosts of the political past surfaced in the state of Chiapas
last month, when the PRI governor was caught on tape saying local
newspapers would be pressured to report that Labastida had
triumphed in a televised debate -- contrary to what most polls
showed.
</P>
<P>
   The governor denied any wrongdoing, saying the local PRI sent
the information to newspapers, which were free to publish what they
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the electoral institute has had difficulty running
public service announcements encouraging voter participation and
telling how to help prevent fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the institute was given free radio and television
time under a law reserving airtime for the government. This year,
the national commission of broadcasters decided the institute
should pay since it was spun off from the government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although some spots were broadcast in November and December,
they ''almost completely disappeared'' in the first four months of
this year, Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   Following widespread publicity of the dispute, the commission of
media owners reached an agreement with the institute last week and
began running the ads again.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Secretariat, which oversees broadcasting -- as well
as political affairs -- has failed to help the institute, Sanchez
said. The secretariat did not respond to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo Meyer, a historian at the Colegio de Mexico, said the
interests of many news media owners coincide with those of the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the ministry does is reach an agreement with the media,
not pressure it. The media are soldiers of the system,'' Meyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasters insist it's an issue of law, not politics, and
they have worked hard to ensure fair election coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the conflicts, almost all sides agree that coverage of
the campaigns has improved greatly since the 1988 presidential
campaign, when the country's two main television networks devoted
92 percent, and newspapers 55 percent, of their coverage to the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are two months left in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that we will still have some changes in the next
months,'' Sanchez said. ''The fact is, if we want to have a good
election, we need different behavior.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 84; Dow Sheds 66  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell again Tuesday as an early onset of
summer doldrums and nervousness about the Federal Reserve's
upcoming meeting squelched investor's enthusiasm for technology
shares.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech issues struggled higher in morning trading but soon
fell as profit-taking continued following Friday's modest rally.
The tech slump spread to other sectors of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index closed down 84.37 at 3,585.01 while
the Dow Jones industrial average fell 66.88 to 10,536.75. The
Nasdaq is now down 11.9 percent from the beginning of the year and
29 percent below its record close of 5,048.62 reached on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index dropped 12.03 to 1,412.14, and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 9.22 to 490.86.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems originally led other blue-chip technology shares
lower, falling for a second day in response to a story in Barron's
magazine warning that the company's growth rate could slow. Cisco's
shares edged higher toward the end of the day ahead of the
company's earnings announcement. The earnings, which were released
just after trading closed, beat analyst expectations by a penny per
share.
</P>
<P>
   But the damage to the rest of the tech sector had already been
done. Hewlett-Packard fell 2~ to 132 13/16, Microsoft was off 2 at
67 13/16 and Sun Microsystems fell 3\ to 82[.
</P>
<P>
   Bucking the downtrend in tech stocks, shares of 3Com rose
sharply after the maker of computer network equipment said it would
complete the spinoff of Palm Inc. several months ahead of schedule.
3Com shares surged 4 9/16 to 48\ while Palm shares fell 3[ to 29[.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Wal-Mart rose | to 53 after the leading retailer
announced earnings that beat analyst estimates.
</P>
<P>
   With few major economic indicators coming out and the next
meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee a week off,
stock trading has been slow in recent sessions. Monday was the
quietest session of the year so far, matching the slow pace that
the market often sees in the summertime.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the onset of the Fed watch,'' said Ronald J. Hill,
investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. ''There's
not a lot going on, but the tone is very heavy ... It's been a
tough way to make money these days.''
</P>
<P>
   William P. Miller, chief investment officer of large cap
equities at American Express Asset Management Group in Minneapolis,
said investors continued to trim their holdings of tech stocks
after their recent advance.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are booking profits ahead of next week, and since much
of the runup was in the tech sector, that's where they're
selling,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing issues by a 5-to-4 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,615 down, 1,301 up and 501
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.07 billion shares, up from
946.33 million shares the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas markets also had declines. In Tokyo, the benchmark
Nikkei stock average tumbled 355.42 points, or 1.95 percent, to
close at 17,844.54 points, its lowest level in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's DAX index was down 1.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
was down 1.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 2.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> La Nina Ocean Cooling May Be Easing  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- La Nina, the Pacific Ocean cooling that has
brought disruptive weather for months, including last summer's
drought, may finally be easing.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina has disappeared in the eastern Pacific Ocean and is
rapidly easing over the rest of that ocean, according to
researchers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
Md., who studied satellite and ocean buoy observations.
</P>
<P>
   ''As expected, La Nina reached a maximum in January 2000 and has
been waning ever since,'' said oceanographer David Adamec.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, climate experts at the National Weather Service
say La Nina ''is not quite history yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Laver, deputy director of the Weather Service's Climate
Prediction Center in Camp Springs, Md., said that while ocean
temperatures have moderated in the eastern pacific, they remain
cool in the central portion of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would say (La Nina) is still there, but it's declining,''
he said. ''We think by the end of the year it will be neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Unusually cold surface water, which is a prime characteristic of
La Nina, is being replaced by water 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer off
the coast of South America, Adamec said.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina is the latest in a series of unusual Pacific Ocean
events that have been affecting climate around the world for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   When the water in that ocean is unusually warm it causes more
evaporation, creating more storms, disrupting the upper level jet
stream and reducing the fish catch off South America. That's called
El Nino, the Spanish term for the little boy, referring to the Baby
Jesus, because it traditionally has been first noticed by fishermen
around Christmas time.
</P>
<P>
   When scientists determined that El Ninos, which occur every
three to seven years, were sometimes followed by periods of
unusually cold water, they decided to name them La Nina, or little
girl.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1997 an unusually warm El Nino developed,
changing storm tracks across the Pacific and causing storm after
storm to slam into the West Coast of the United States. At the same
time, the effects of this event tended to suppress hurricanes in
the Atlantic. It developed into the strongest El Nino on record.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the situation reversed. Instead of water conditions
returning to normal, cold water replaced the warm bringing on La
Nina, which also causes unusual weather in other areas, such as
droughts in the central and eastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   If La Nina does come to an end, it could be good news for
residents of the East and Gulf Coasts -- eventually.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina years tend to have more than the usual number of
hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean. Last year was marked by 12
tropical storms, including five major ones.
</P>
<P>
   Laver cautioned against too much optimism for the upcoming
hurricane season, however, noting that the vestiges of La Nina are
still there and are likely to influence this year's storm season.

<HEADLINE> GAO Says U.S. Lags on Chemical Arms  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States probably won't meet a 2007
deadline for destroying chemical weapons stockpiles, congressional
investigators say, noting that only about 18 percent of the 31,496
tons of nerve gas, mustard gas and other chemicals have been
incinerated since the effort began in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''After two years of essentially sticking their head in the
sand, they (military officials) have publicly admitted for the
first time that they are not going to meet this deadline,'' said
Sean Conway, spokesman for Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., a critic of
the program. ''It raises a whole series of questions. If we miss
the deadline, what then? More importantly, how do we deal with a
bureaucracy that seems to have made a mess of this program?''
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office report also faulted the Army's
management of the $15 billion chemical weapons destruction program.
Investigators found $63 million in spending which had not been
properly recorded, and Army officials could not explain why $10.4
million appropriated for the program had not been spent, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional critics asked for the GAO investigation last year
after a Pentagon report said the Army had not spent millions of
dollars earmarked for chemical weapons destruction, possibly
leaving the money available for other uses.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report found nearly $500 million in unspent money from
1992 through 1999. The report said most of that money accumulated
because of the Pentagon's sluggish financial systems, because
environmental permits were delayed or because contractors had not
yet billed the government for their work.
</P>
<P>
   ''There wasn't any (unspent) money being squirreled away, like
some people thought,'' said Mickey Morales, a spokesman for the
Army's Program Manager for Chemical Demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
   Congress ordered the military to begin destroying America's
31,496 tons of nerve agents, mustard gas and other chemical weapons
in 1986. In 1997, the Senate ratified the international Chemical
Weapons Convention, which bans the production, use or stockpiling
of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report, sent to Congress on Monday, said the U.S. has
destroyed about 18 percent of its stockpile at incinerators in Utah
and an island about 800 miles southwest of Hawaii. The Army also is
building facilities to destroy chemical weapons at sites in Oregon,
Arkansas, Indiana, Maryland and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty requires that countries must have destroyed 1 percent
of their chemical weapons stockpiles by now, Morales said.
</P>
<P>
   Area residents and local officials objected to plans to
incinerate chemical weapons at the Pueblo Chemical Depot in
Colorado and the Blue Grass Army Depot near Richmond, Ky. Congress
blocked incineration plans at those sites in 1996, ordering the
Army to develop other ways to neutralize and destroy the deadly
chemicals. The Army plans to spend $40 million to complete those
studies this year.
</P>
<P>
   That delay means that the 10 percent of the U.S. stockpile at
the Colorado and Kentucky sites will probably not be destroyed by
the treaty's 2007 deadline, the GAO report said. The treaty has a
provision allowing countries to get an extension of up to five
years if they cannot meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 135 nations have ratified the chemical weapons treaty
and another 36 have said they support it but have not ratified it.

<HEADLINE> Officials: P.Rico Is Drug Pipeline  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lax enforcement has allowed Puerto Rico to
become the main Caribbean pipeline for illegal drugs heading to the
U.S. mainland, officials told a Senate panel Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cocaine and heroin traffickers from Colombia have transformed
Puerto Rico into the largest staging area in the Caribbean for
illicit drugs destined for the U.S. market,'' said Michael Vigil,
the Drug Enforcement Administration's agent in charge in the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   About 512 metric tons of cocaine came into the United States
last year, with one-fourth of that traveling somewhere through the
commonwealth's 300 miles of coastline and secluded cays, officials
from the DEA, Customs Service and the Coast Guard told a Senate
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not maintained control of our own backyard,'' said
Vice Admiral John Shkor, commander of the Coast Guard Atlantic
Area.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine flow into Puerto Rico has increased threefold in the
last two years, despite the increase in seizures by American
officials, he said. And once it's in Puerto Rico -- a 110-mile long
island with the third-busiest seaport in North America -- smugglers
have fewer problems getting it to the United States because things
from the island are not searched by Customs, Shkor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once it's in Puerto Rico, from a customs standpoint, it's
effectively in Kansas,'' said Shkor, who plans to make the drug
trade in Puerto Rico one of his main focuses this year.
</P>
<P>
   The drug trade in Puerto Rico and other Caribbean countries like
Haiti will continue to rise with U.S. border officials cracking
down on the smuggling through Mexico, Vigil said. In the 80s,
officials started cracking down on the Caribbean drug trade, so the
drug runners moved their operations to Mexico. Now that officials
have moved their forces to America's southwest borders, the
smugglers are moving back to the Caribbean, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without question, the illicit drug trade has a devastating
effect not only on the United States, but also on those countries
that are being used as transit points,'' said Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's criminal
justice oversight subcommittee. ''Puerto Rico's murder rate, much
of it drug-related, is reported to be the highest in the United
States or its possessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that 80 percent of the documented murders in
Puerto Rico are drug-related, Vigil said.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti also is becoming a big problem, said John Varrone, acting
deputy assistant commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service's office
of investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The political instability in Haiti, combined with its lack of
law enforcement capabilities provides a safe haven to drug
smuggling operations,'' he said. ''Haiti is clearly well positioned
for traffickers to use as a path of least resistance, particularly
when enforcement activity in Puerto Rico is high.''
</P>
<P>
   Varrone showed the subcommittee video tapes of drug smugglers
doing fly-by drops of drugs to waiting trucks and desperate boaters
ramming customs boats in an unsuccessful attempt to escape capture.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, pointed out that Cincinnati had 464
heroin arrests in 1999, compared to 19 in 1990. He said he will
push for increased funding for Customs, the Coast Guard and DEA to
help stop of the flow of drugs through the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ability of our law enforcement to succeed in keeping drugs
off our streets is directly linked to our ability to keep drugs
from ever reaching our shores,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   Stephen Edwards' business performs consultant and legal work for
the riverboat casino industry. Prosecutors accused him of serving
as the manager of the elaborate extortion scheme they said his
father masterminded. But what prosecutors called payoffs, the
defense said were really legitimate payments for legal and
consulting work.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted Tuesday of 18 of 23 counts. If convicted of all 23
charges, he could have faced up to 280 years in prison and a $6
million fine.
Andrew Martin
</P>
<P>
   A former chairman of the State Mineral Board, Andrew Martin
became an aide to Edwards during his 1991 gubernatorial campaign.
He was bodyguard (who carried an automatic weapon), a legislative
committee monitor and right-hand man to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   As the administration ended, Martin would sit in on meetings of
committees that dealt with gambling issues, though he is not
registered as a lobbyist. Martin would tell reporters he was ''just
visiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors accused him of demanding and receiving $100,000 in
monthly extortion payments from former Treasure Chest Casino owner
Robert Guidry. The money, prosecutors said, was divided between
Martin and the Edwardses. Guidry testified that he sometimes left
the money in trash bins for Martin to retrieve.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said Guidry, who testified under a plea
agreement, lied in hopes of getting a light sentence and to stave
off a federal investigation of his $300 million tugboat business.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted of all charges Tuesday. Faces up to 120 years in
prison and a $1.75 million fine.
Cecil Brown
</P>
<P>
   A cattleman and auctioneer from Eunice, La., Cecil Brown met
Edwin Edwards during his first term in office when he asked Brown
to break in a horse.
</P>
<P>
   He often joined Edwards on the campaign trail and the two
started a few businesses together, including a paint and patch
company that was run by Edwards' son David.
</P>
<P>
   The cattleman acknowledges he was paid to help win Edwards'
favor for two projects: building a private juvenile prison in Jena,
La., and bringing a professional basketball team to New Orleans.
Edwards gave support to both deals during his last term but they
fell through and soon were under the scrutiny of federal
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and former Houston Mayor Fred Hofheinz were indicted in
November in connection with the projects. A date for their trial
has not been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, prosecutors said Brown extorted a group of
investors from the St. Louis area and worked with co-defendant
Bobby Johnson to extort the former owners of the Belle of Baton
Rouge. Defense lawyers said Brown was paid for legitimate
consulting work.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted of all charges Tuesday. Faces up to 80 years in prison
and a $1 million fine.
Greg Tarver
</P>
<P>
   A powerful state senator who once was active in the civil rights
movement, Tarver runs a successful mortuary and insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged that Tarver gave Edwards a confidential
background report on applicants for the state's final riverboat
license and that Edwards forwarded it to San Francisco 49ers owner
Eddie DeBartolo Jr. But they were unable to come up with hard
evidence that it was Tarver who gave DeBartolo the report.
</P>
<P>
   Acquitted of all charges Tuesday. Could have faced up to 55
years in prison and a $2.75 million fine.
Ecotry Fuller
</P>
<P>
   A retired teacher and school principal, Fuller is a member of
the Louisiana Gaming Control Board. While he refused to give up his
seat, he had not attended a board meeting since he was implicated
in the case in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that in 1997 Fuller gave co-defendant Greg
Tarver a copy of a confidential state police report about
applicants for a riverboat license. They also claimed he lied to
the federal grand jury about whether he had given the report to
Tarver. As in the Tarver case, there was no hard evidence to show
that it was Fuller and Tarver who helped DeBartolo get the report.
</P>
<P>
   Acquitted of all charges Tuesday. Could have faced up to 60
years in prison and a $3 million fine.
Bobby Johnson
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Johnson is a millionaire contractor and real estate
investor even though he claims to be illiterate. Johnson said he
grew up on the streets of Baton Rouge after being kicked out of his
home as a teen-ager and never made it past seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said he extorted Jazz Enterprises Inc., which sought
and received a riverboat casino license. A government witness
secretly recorded several conversations with Johnson. The defense
cast Johnson as a braggart and buffoon whose threats and promises
were not to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted of all charges Tuesday. Faces up to 90 years in prison
and a $2.25 million fine.

<HEADLINE> Explosive Closes High School  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERGREEN PARK, Ill. (AP) -- A high school was closed Tuesday and
a student taken into custody after officials found a
gasoline-filled bottle intended to explode inside a locker.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year-old freshman at Evergreen Park Community High School
in suburban Chicago was taken into custody after he initially told
police there were three more such devices in the building, said
Deputy Police Chief John Watson.
</P>
<P>
   The boy recanted that statement after talking with
psychiatrists, and the Cook County Bomb Squad also found no
additional bombs.
</P>
<P>
   However, the school will remain closed until Thursday morning
while its own security personnel conduct another search, Watson
said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries and the only damage was to the locker. It
was unclear whose locker it was.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   School officials noticed smoke coming from the locker and found
a small plastic bottle filled with gasoline inside, Watson said. A
fuse on the bottle had been lit, but it failed to set off the
explosion because of a lack of oxygen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Evergreen Park High School is the alma mater of Unabomber Ted
Kaczynski, who sent mail bombs that killed three people before his
arrest in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Police: Atlantic City man killed witness who testified against him  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A man who was acquitted of murder
last year after insisting ''I ain't capable of killing nobody'' is
now accused of fatally beating a witness who testified against him.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Jenkins, 22, of Absecon, is accused of bludgeoning
Arthur Thomas, 42, to death with a brick Monday outside a housing
project here.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins was acquitted last June in the Feb. 20, 1997 killing of
drug dealer Mark Cotton, who was found shot to death behind a
building. He was arrested more than a year after the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ain't capable of killing nobody,'' a tearful Jenkins told a
judge during his arraignment in the first killing. His attorney,
Ralph Paolone, said it was a case of mistaken identity; another man
shot Cotton, Paolone said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, one of two witnesses to put Jenkins at the scene,
testified that he saw Jenkins before the killing with a gun that
looked like the one used in the killing. He also said he saw
Jenkins running from the scene moments later, after gunshots rang
out.
</P>
<P>
   But jurors believed Jenkins, clearing him after a five-day
trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he allegedly made reference to Thomas' testimony when
he encountered him near a flight of steps outside the Lexington
Courts projects on Delaware Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Wielding a brick, he struck Thomas at least twice in the back of
the head, knocking him down the steps, where Thomas suffered
further head injury, according to First Assistant Atlantic County
Prosecutor Murray Talasnik.
</P>
<P>
   The brick fractured Thomas' skull and jammed pieces of it into
Thomas' brain, according to an autopsy conducted by Dr. Hydow Park,
the county medical examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a security guard at a supermarket who was engaged to be
married and had a daughter, died at the scene. For 90 minutes, his
body lay in full view of pedestrians and passing casino buses as
police documented the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, whose criminal record includes drug and weapons
arrests, was being held on $500,000 bail. In addition to murder, he
is charged with possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In court Tuesday, he stood handcuffed and wearing an orange jail
jumpsuit. He did not have an attorney as Superior Court Judge
Albert J. Garofolo read him his rights and asked him if he
understood the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Garofolo ordered him to submit to fingerprinting after Talasnik
told the judge that Jenkins had ''some unpleasantness'' when
officers attempted to get his prints in jail Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought my lawyer was supposed to be present,'' said
Jenkins. Garofolo said it wasn't required.
</P>
<P>
   Talasnik would not comment on the motive. He said witnesses in
murder trials occasionally get protection from law enforcement
during trial, but not afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Prosecutor Joel Mayer, who prosecuted Jenkins in the
first killing, said Thomas did not ask for or receive protection.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Thomas was a reluctant witness in my murder trial, but no
more so than most individuals who are exposed to high-crime areas.
I would hope, certainly, that there won't be a chilling effect (on
future crime witnesses). The overwhelming majority of the people
who live there still want to do the right thing,'' Mayer said.
</P>
<P>
   Talasnik said it would be up to a judge to determine whether
information about the Cotton killing is admitted into evidence if
Jenkins goes to trial for the second killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's certainly a terrible, tragic circumstance -- for Mr.
Thomas and his family, and for everyone in this neighborhood who
wants to do the right thing,'' Mayer said.

<HEADLINE> No Mechanical Failure in MV-22 Crash  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The top Marine Corps general said Tuesday he
is confident that mechanical and structural failure can be ruled
out as causes of the MV-22 Osprey crash that killed 19 Marines last
month. As a result he has given the go-ahead for the remaining
Osprey aircraft to begin returning to flight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel confident we can put them back in the air,'' Gen. James
L. Jones, the Marine Corps commandant, said in an interview.
''Everything appears to have been working normally'' at the time of
the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said families of the 19 victims, as well as members of
Congress, have been told the Osprey -- a hybrid that takes off and
lands like a helicopter but flies like an airplane -- is safe to fly
with no need for redesign.
</P>
<P>
   An early model Osprey used for experimental flight was expected
to fly from Nova Scotia to Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Md.,
on Wednesday -- the first Osprey flight since the accident April 8.
Two test-model Ospreys will be used to simulate some of the
circumstances of the fatal accident, in order to validate the
investigators' findings, and later this month the full Osprey fleet
will return to flight, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   At a Pentagon news conference, Lt. Gen. Fred McCorkle said
investigators have concluded that the crash was caused by a loss of
aerodynamic lift that forced the aircraft into a fatal nose dive as
it was about to land.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that are not yet clear, the Osprey -- with a crew of
four plus 15 Marines as passengers -- descended too rapidly toward a
small airport at Marana, Ariz., McCorkle said. It was descending at
more than 1,000 feet per minute, he said, compared to the maximum
recommended rate of 800 feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   As the pilot executed an angle bank of between 5 and 15 degrees
right at about 280 feet off the ground at about 8 p.m. local time,
the aircraft encountered an aerodynamic phenomenon known as ''power
settling'' and four seconds later it nosedived into the ground.
McCorkle said this condition was similar to an engine stall and
seemed to be related to the excessive rate of descent, a slow
forward airspeed and the banking maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said the ''power settling'' problem was not unique to
the Osprey, and that pilots are trained to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   Both Jones and McCorkle said investigators were not yet prepared
to ascribe the accident to pilot error. They said more study was
needed. McCorkle said colleagues of the pilot, Maj. John A. Brow,
of California, Md., have told investigators that Brow was an
exceptionally talented pilot with more than 3,700 hours of flight
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have found no structural or design flaws that would
preclude safe flight operations and we maintain complete faith in
the safety of the V-22,'' McCorkle said. Investigators are still
studying whether the proximity of another Osprey, which landed
about 300 feet ahead of the one that crashed, played a role.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the worst aviation disaster for the Marines since
22 were killed in a helicopter crash in South Korea in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   As a gesture of confidence in the aircraft's airworthiness,
Jones said he and Air Force Chief of Staff Michael Ryan plan to be
passengers aboard the first Osprey to return to operational flight.
Although the Osprey is being produced mainly for the Marines, the
Air Force plans to buy some for special operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey is built by Boeing Co. and Bell Helicopter Textron.
It is intended to replace the Marine Corps' Vietnam-era CH-46
helicopters as the primary means of transporting troops into combat
from ships offshore.

<HEADLINE> WPP, Y&AMP;R Reports Send Shares Down  </HEADLINE>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street sent the stocks of advertising
powerhouses WPP Group PLC and Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. lower Tuesday
following reports that the companies had agreed in principle on a
stock-swap combination.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies declined comment for the second day on
assertions by sources familiar with the talks that London-based WPP
Group had agreed in principle to acquire Y&AMP;R for stock in a deal
that would make WPP the world's biggest ad company.
</P>
<P>
   The sources, who spoke on condition that they not be named, said
the companies had agreed on a share swap ratio that valued Y&AMP;R at
about $5.3 billion as of Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   But WPP's American Depositary Receipts, the vehicle under which
WPP shares are traded in the United States, tumbled 11.4 percent on
Monday and another 5.4 percent on Tuesday, shaving the present
value of the deal to about $4.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   WPP ADRs fell $3.62{ to $63.25 on Tuesday on the Nasdaq Stock
Market.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R's shares, which lost 8 percent on Monday, were down another
7.3 percent, or $3.625 a share, to $46.18} in trading Tuesday on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said WPP is offering 0.835 of its ADRs for each Y&AMP;R
share, valuing it at $52.81 per share.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price declines could suggest the market doubts that
the deal will be completed.
</P>
<P>
   But the sources said the companies were ironing out legal
details of the deal and were enlisting support of key Y&AMP;R
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R executives are scheduled to appear Friday before the
company's annual shareholders meeting in New York.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Y&AMP;R and WPP Group have been discussing a deal for
about four months and their talks broke down twice only to be
revived later.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies share some powerful clients including Ford Motor
Co., Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. and Kraft Foods.

<HEADLINE> Profile Of Edwin Edwards  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN McGILL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- No story sums up the lore of Edwin
Edwards better than the one told since the early 1980s -- the one
about him on stage at a religious gathering where the preacher
asked everyone to stand who never drank, smoked or lusted after
another's mate.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards remained sitting. ''Two out of three ain't bad,'' he
said, to great laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Picture a non-smoking, Scripture-quoting teetotaler who loves
high-stakes gambling, beautiful women and ribald jokes. At age 72,
Louisiana's four-term former governor still wears the disparate
images comfortably -- although he makes it clear these days that his
35-year-old wife, Candy, is now the only woman in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' rakish image was cultivated over a 46-year public life.
Born in 1927 to a sharecropper and a midwife, he was elected in
1954 to the City Council of rural Crowley, La.
</P>
<P>
   His mother was a Cajun, a descendant of the Nova Scotian exiles
who settled southwestern Louisiana more than two centuries ago.
Edwards' softly Cajun-accented speech would become as much a part
of his persona as his neatly groomed silver hair and quick, deadpan
wit.
</P>
<P>
   From Crowley, Edwards moved on to the state Senate in 1964, then
to Congress in 1965. Then it was the governor's office and a 1972
inauguration during which he took the oath of office in English and
in French.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know this many Cajuns owned tuxedos,'' he quipped at
the inaugural ball.
</P>
<P>
   Hints of scandal would arise soon afterward. Grand juries would
look into his finances and campaign contributions in the early and
mid-1970s. There would be congressional hearings and grand jury
appearances leading to his admission in 1977 that he and his
then-wife, Elaine, received $20,000 in 1971 and 1972 from a South
Korean government agent. Nothing came of any of it.
</P>
<P>
   A disgruntled former aide, Clyde Vidrine, wrote a book in 1974
accusing Edwards of exchanging high-level jobs for campaign
contributions. Investigations followed but again, nothing came of
them.
</P>
<P>
   And Vidrine's allegations that Edwards indulged in rampant
womanizing seemed only to enhance the governor's image.
</P>
<P>
   But Edwards was far from just a playboy.
</P>
<P>
   He was a deft politician, a populist Democrat who proudly touted
his courting of minorities and the poor as a source of personal
pride.
</P>
<P>
   As Louisiana's economic fortunes grew during the 1970s' oil
boom, he was able to take advantage of rising prices by having the
state switch its method of taxing oil from a rate based on volume
to a percentage of value.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards left the governor's office in 1979 at the height of his
popularity, constitutionally prohibited from a third consecutive
term.
</P>
<P>
   He came back in 1983, defeating his successor, Dave Treen, in a
landslide.
</P>
<P>
   But 1983 also saw the murder of his brother Nolan, an attorney
shot to death in his Crowley office by a disgruntled client. And
there would be more personal and political travails once Edwards
regained office.
</P>
<P>
   While the state's financial and economic fortunes fell with the
price of oil, Edwards was indicted in 1985 on racketeering charges
stemming from hospital and nursing home investments.
</P>
<P>
   His 1985 trial featured characteristic Edwards humor. He arrived
one day in a mule-drawn carriage, saying it represented the pace of
the trial. Another time, noting that news photographers often have
to walk backward rapidly, he obliged them by backing into court.
</P>
<P>
   After one mistrial, Edwards was acquitted in 1986, but his
political fortunes were on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   Either because of his trials or the state economy, he was
defeated for re-election in 1987 by Rep. Buddy Roemer. Edwards'
40-year marriage to Elaine ended in divorce in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts wrote him off as politically dead, but they had not
foreseen the rise of David Duke, the ex-Ku Klux Klan leader. Duke
narrowly won a state House seat in 1989 and garnered a relatively
small but politically significant power base.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and Duke each got about a third of the vote in a 1991
gubernatorial primary, ousting Roemer. Edwards went on to win the
runoff in a landslide, aided by fears that having an ex-neo Nazi in
the governor's mansion would ruin the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vote for the crook, it's important,'' one popular bumper
sticker read.
</P>
<P>
   Going in to his fourth term, Edwards expressed hope of
burnishing his image.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'm now thinking about is what will be said about me four
years, five years, 100 years from now,'' he said just before the
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   But federal prosecutors wanted him to be remembered for
allegedly conspiring with friends to extort money from applicants
for lucrative riverboat casino licenses. After a four-month trial,
Edwards was convicted on Tuesday of 17 counts of racketeering and
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have a saying, Edwards said after the verdict: ''If
you sit by a river long enough, the dead bodies of your enemies
will float by you. I suppose the feds sat by the river long enough
and here comes my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, Edwards maintained his characteristic
composure and displayed his mischievous nature.
</P>
<P>
   One day, the doors had just closed on a crowded elevator near
the courtroom when Edwards leaned over to a Baton Rouge TV reporter
and asked her: ''Do you know the difference between sexual
relations and a Caesar salad?''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar with his ways, she eyed him warily and said, ''No.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughter erupted as the elevator doors opened and Edwards
responded, ''Could we discuss it over dinner some time?''

<HEADLINE> New Holocaust Documentary To Air  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The Holocaust emerged in a piecemeal, step-by-step
way and not as the result of a single order from Nazi leaders,
according to a new television documentary series.
</P>
<P>
   The six-part series ''Holocaust'' claims to be the most
comprehensive history of the Nazi genocide ever filmed. It was
produced by Germany's ZDF television channel in collaboration with
the U.S.-based History Channel and other broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I told people in Germany about the series, they were
telling me, 'Not again,''' Maurice Philip Remy, the series'
Munich-based producer and director, said at a news conference in
London detailing the documentary's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ''But there is still a deep interest in facts and background
information on the Holocaust,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. historian Christopher Browning -- who served as an adviser
to the series, along with academics from Germany, Britain and
Israel -- said new evidence has shown that the emergence of the
Holocaust was ''a very complex development, and often quite
ambiguous along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The programs' researchers say they uncovered significant new
historical material, including never-before-seen film footage and
documents from Eastern European archives opened after the fall of
communism.
</P>
<P>
   The series, which will air early next year in the United States,
draws on interviews with more than 500 witnesses to the Holocaust,
including both victims and perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   Newly uncovered film footage, some of it in color, includes
graphic images of life in the Jewish ghettos under Nazi control and
scenes of Auschwitz prisoners being transported in open rail cars
in midwinter.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the series' most important new information centers on
the summer and autumn of 1941, the period in which plans for the
extermination of the Jews were taking shape. It includes minutes of
Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels' daily briefings, found in a
Moscow archive.
</P>
<P>
   The series tries to show the role played by senior Nazis, along
with lower-level officials and ordinary people who allowed the
genocide to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   It also contains documentation of a little-known act of Jewish
resistance, in which the prisoners of the Sobibor concentration
camp staged a mass breakout in October 1943.

<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- As regional phone companies rush to bundle
communication services into one-stop-shopping packages, BellSouth
Corp. is adding satellite television to its offerings.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth announced a partnership Tuesday with a unit of General
Electric to offer digital television in the nine states BellSouth
serves.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with GE Capital makes Atlanta-based BellSouth the first
regional telephone company to compete with established satellite
services such as DISH Network and DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sets us up for a major video initiative,'' said Bob Frame,
president of BellSouth Entertainment. ''It gives us the capability
of offering our customers a full suite of communication services.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will enable BellSouth to expand its potential market
for entertainment services from a handful of cities to 14 million
households in its nine-state territory within months. The company
now offers TV to about 120,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the partnership could include 50 million households.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's going to change the way people use TV,'' said
Sue McLaughlin, BellSouth's president of consumer services. ''And
we think they're going to love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Frame called it ''a
significant, long-term agreement'' between BellSouth and GE
Capital, based in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said the satellite television industry anticipates
annual growth of 25 percent at least through 2002, ''and we
certainly intend to get our share of that.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth officials said the satellite service would be offered
in several programming packages, but that prices would not be set
until early next year. Frame said the service would be
''competitive'' with cable service, which ranges from $20 to $50 in
most areas.
</P>
<P>
   Like other phone companies, BellSouth has been racing to offer
customers one-stop shopping -- packages that include entertainment
along with local phone service, Internet access, wireless service.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, if it receives regulatory approval, BellSouth hopes
to enter the long-distance call market. The company plans to roll
out long-distance service in Georgia, and possibly another state,
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, BellSouth plans to use satellites for more than
delivering television programs. The technology is capable -- at
least in theory -- of handling e-mail, Internet access, video games
and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But in the partnership with GE, BellSouth will start by
delivering the same Americast package of programs that BellSouth
currently offers in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth now has digital television service in 11 metropolitan
areas, including metro Atlanta, Orlando and New Orleans.
Programming comes from Americast, an alliance of BellSouth, Walt
Disney Co., GTE Corp. and two units of SBC Communications.
Subscribers receive up to 160 channels. Among them are music,
pay-per-view, broadcast, cable and premium television channels.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's Americast is now delivered in several ways -- from
antennas on tall buildings and mountains to high-speed fiber optic
cable.
</P>
<P>
   With the satellite venture, BellSouth also aims to siphon
customers dissatisfied with traditional cable operators, Frame
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to bad-mouth the cable competition,'' he said,
adding that ''it's easy to do.''

<HEADLINE> Icahn Said Eyeing Penney Investment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Financier Carl Icahn, who gained a reputation as a
corporate raider in the 1980s by buying big stakes in undervalued
companies and pressed for changes, has indicated interest in a
major investment in struggling retailer J.C. Penney Co. Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing last week with federal regulators, Icahn indicated
he might make an investment exceeding $15 million but falling short
of 15 percent of Penney's outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Plano-based retailer said Tuesday they didn't
know Icahn's intentions and have not talked with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are aware of Mr. Icahn's filing and have had no direct
contact with him or his representatives,'' said Rita Trevino Flynn,
Penney spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Penney's stock, which has lost about two-thirds of its value in
the past 12 months, has improved in the last week on the
announcement that chief executive James Oesterreicher will retire
and on news of Icahn's interest.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Tuesday, Penney shares fell 75 cents to $18.06\ on
the New York Stock Exchange after gaining $1.62{ on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, Icahn profited handsomely through investments in
Texaco Inc., USX Corp. and Phillips Petroleum Co. He bought Trans
World Airlines Inc., which was later sold.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Icahn has indicated he is prepared to make a bid
for Nabisco Group Holding Corp., which owns 80.6 percent of the
company that makes Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers. He is one of
Nabisco Group's biggest shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In his federal filing, Icahn also indicated intent to buy a
significant share in Seagate Technology Inc., based in Scotts
Valley, Calif., the leading computer disk drive maker.

<HEADLINE> Blumenthal calls for investigation of vehicle emissions program  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Citing reports of widespread corruption
and criminal activity, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal is
calling for an investigation of the vehicle emissions testing and
safety inspection program.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said Tuesday he has received reports of bribes and
demands for payment for emission stickers as well as theft of
stickers, which are then sold on the street. The reports have come
from state police, consumers and emissions testing employees, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These reports are extraordinarily credible, widespread and
alarming in their scope and magnitude and clearly warrant a full
investigation,'' Blumenthal said. ''These reports are very
troubling and even alarming because they mean a serious loss of
money due to the state and credibility significant to the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, who requested the probe in a letter last week to
Department of Motor Vehicles Commissioner Jose Salinas, said his
office has received reports of Envirotest inspectors approving cars
with serious safety and emissions problems. His letter cites
reports of ''widespread corruption and criminal activity'' in the
emissions program run by Envirotest System Corp. in East Granby.
</P>
<P>
   Envirotest, which received a 10-year, $25 million state contract
in 1994 to run the emissions testing and safety inspections, denied
there is widespread fraud in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had two isolated incidents,'' said company spokeswoman
Martha Sanders. ''To me that does not mean widespread.''
</P>
<P>
   Those incidents, which occurred in Bridgeport and Darien, were
brought to light by the company, Sanders said. Employees were
arrested and fired, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Envirotest, which tests more than 1.2 million vehicles annually
at 25 stations, has a quality assurance department which conducts
daily record audits that look for irregularities, Sanders said.
Surveillance cameras monitor safety lanes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Envirotest also had an independent company recently conduct 34
covert audits at all stations, Sanders said. Employees were offered
$50 bribes to pass a vehicle and none took them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said that since 1995 Envirotest has been fined
$425,000 by the state for its test records, inspection procedures
and record keeping. Envirotest officials said the fines resulted
from procedural issues, not fraud.
</P>
<P>
   DMV spokesman Bill Seymour said the agency has already been
looking into whether there is more widespread fraud after the
Darien and Bridgeport incidents. That investigation, which involves
state police, began about a month ago and has not reached any
conclusions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping this is just a few bad apples in the barrel,''
Seymour said. ''We have made clear that the issue of fraud goes
directly to the integrity of the program and federal law.''

<HEADLINE> Issues Dominate Ethiopian Elections  </HEADLINE>
By ABEBE ANDUALEM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Land reform, better economic
management and respect for human rights have dominated a series of
unprecedented public debates in the run-up to only the second
nationwide elections in Ethiopia's history.
</P>
<P>
   The debates, attended by large crowds and rebroadcast by
state-run radio and television, have given political opponents of
the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Front a rare
opportunity to voice their complaints about the government.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, voters will choose a federal parliament, nine
regional assemblies and council members for the capital, Addis
Ababa, and the eastern city of Dire Dawa.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a radical change in the Addis city administration,''
said shopkeeper Yoseph Desta, 46, complaining about high taxes and
few services. ''All of us are eagerly awaiting to see new faces
after the elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The Front, a four-party coalition, has run the Horn of Africa
nation since 1991, when it ousted a Marxist regime that had been in
power for 17 years. It has gradually tolerated more open political
discussion in the impoverished nation.
</P>
<P>
   As it did in the country's first elections in May 1995, the
Front is expected to dominate Sunday's poll. The outcome is also
expected to confirm the fundamental role Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi and his Tigray People's Liberation Front plays in the
governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   One topic that did not figure in the public debate -- except when
support was expressed for the government's position -- is the
two-year border conflict with Eritrea which has left thousands of
soldiers and civilians dead on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly more than 20 million of Ethiopia's estimated 29 million
eligible voters have registered, according to Akililou Merkuria of
the National Electoral Board. The population is estimated at 61.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   No elections will be held in the southeastern Somali region,
which has been hard-hit by drought and severe food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   The board says there are 65 legally recognized political parties
in Ethiopia. Seven are national parties, while the others are
regional groups.
</P>
<P>
   While international observers fanned out across the country to
monitor the vote five years ago, the government has restricted poll
watching this year to local groups.
</P>
<P>
   The pressing need for land reform and the uneven economic
development of Ethiopia's nine theoretically autonomous regions has
dominated debate in regional capitals.
</P>
<P>
   After the ouster of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974, all land was
nationalized by the Marxist regime. The front wants to retain state
ownership of land, an issue that has divided opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition ranks are also split over an article in the 1995
constitution that grants regions and linguistic groups the right to
secede from the federation. But all opposition groups agree that
the allocation of federal funds is uneven and favors the country's
northern regions, the Front's political base.

<HEADLINE> Prosectors Indict Alleged Drug Gang  </HEADLINE>
By DERRILL HOLLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Tuesday indicted 13
alleged gang members who prosecutors say were part of a citywide
drug dealing empire, an illegal enterprise reputed to have been the
most violent ever to operate in the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Within the 76-count indictment, individual members are accused
in 16 murders and 12 attempted murders. Investigators say they have
evidence that the group may have been involved in 17 other killings
in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin L. Gray, 28, the alleged ringleader who was indicted on 15
counts of murder, and Rodney Moore, 35, who is charged with seven
murders, have been held without bond since last October.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that since 1988, the two men supervised a
continuing criminal enterprise that included lookouts, drivers,
couriers, enforcers, street salesmen and runners. Some of the
employees of the operation were minors, presumably hired because
they faced potentially less severe punishments in the juvenile
justice system, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The organization distributed large quantities of cocaine,
heroin, crack cocaine and marijuana in several neighborhoods,''
said United States Attorney Wilma A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group protected their turf by robbing or killing
rival drug dealers and suspected informants, and they also robbed
their own customers, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These individuals also committed contract murders for hire,''
said Lewis, adding that cash or drugs were exchanged in return for
participation in murders.
</P>
<P>
   The 98-page indictment describes the use of a network of stash
houses, clandestine drug labs, cellular telephones, pagers, and
secret codes to evade detection.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the killings and much of the group's alleged criminal
activities occurred near housing projects and low income
neighborhoods, said Chief Charles Ramsey of the district's
Metropolitan Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   While 10 of the defendants are in custody, police and the FBI
were searching for Wilford Oliver, 52; Derrick Moore, 32; and Frank
Howard, 30.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, each defendant faces the possibility of life in
prison with no chance of parole. Eleven of them could face the
death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Long Island Sound Bill Passes House  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of dollars in federal money would go
to clean up Long Island Sound under legislation that sailed through
the House on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan bickering last week threatened to scuttle the Long
Island Sound Restoration Act, but a coalition of New York and
Connecticut lawmakers united behind it and pushed it through.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over an unexplained die-off of lobsters in the Sound --
the nation's No. 3 lobster market -- helped rally support for the
measure, which passed 391-29.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Reps. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., and Nancy Johnson,
R-Conn., the bill would earmark $80 million a year for four years
to help upgrade sewage treatment facililties and decrease nitogen
runoff into the waterway. It would target runoff from roads,
parking lots and construction sites. And the bill would fund
habitat restoration projects.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most severe environmental problems facing the
110-mile Sound is hypoxia, which occurs when nitrogen released by
sewage treatment plants overstimulates algae growth. When algae
decays, it sucks up oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio-Johnson bill aims to cut nitrogen output by 58.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Govs. George Pataki in New York and John Rowland in Connecticut
have pledged $200 million and $260 million, respectively, for the
clean-up effort.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., is sponsoring a similar Long
Island Sound bill in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Navy Aboards Boat in West Africa  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Navy has commandos aboard a patrol
boat in the waters off West Africa as a ''precautionary measure''
in light of the intensifying crisis in Sierra Leone, a Pentagon
spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen,
said the Cyclone-class patrol boat USS Thunderbolt was not directly
off the coast of Sierra Leone but was ''in the area and will remain
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The boat normally carries about one dozen Navy SEAL commandos,
Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''(She's) prepared to provide any support or help that she's
called upon to provide,'' he said. ''Right now she's just there as
a precautionary measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the United States is not considering sending any
combat troops to Sierra Leone, but he confirmed news reports that
the Clinton administration has told the United Nations it is
willing to provide air transportation for a battalion of 700 to 800
peacekeepers from Bangladesh to join the embattled U.N. mission in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the United States might also help transport
additional peacekeepers from Jordan and India. He said it was not
yet clear what other kinds of military assistance the United States
might provide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Specifically, the types of help we will provide remain to be
determined because it depends on what the UN and the international
community, including the regional countries in West Africa, decide
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''So we are observing, assessing and listening, and then once
decisions are made about what's going to be done, we'll decide what
help we can provide,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lost tax returns boost surplus by at least $100 million  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- State budget officials on Tuesday
reported receiving thousands of income tax returns, which had been
stuck in the mail, boosting the state's surplus by at least $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   The debate already has begun over what to do with the extra
money.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers want to stick to the budget agreement,
which earmarked any additional surplus for school technology and
debt reduction. Some Democrats, though, say now is the chance to
reinstate a tuition freeze at public state colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats plan to raise the issue when the Legislature
reconvenes next month for a special session, needed to pass
technical bills to implement the budget. A date for that session
has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a golden opportunity for the Legislature to revisit one
important priority we didn't get to in the session,'' Democratic
Sens. Kevin Sullivan, Jose Crisco, Don Williams and Tom Gaffey said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   When lawmakers were finalizing the $12.3 billion budget in the
waning days of the session that ended May 3, they appropriated a
projected surplus of about $250 million. But lawmakers believed
that surplus could rise to $300 million as more money trickled in.
</P>
<P>
   With the late tax returns, the surplus is now expected to be
$325 million to $380 million, said state budget director Marc Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said that, as of Friday, 37,000 tax returns that were
presumably mailed by the April 18 deadline had been delivered late
to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had obvious conversations with the Postal Service about
the delay,'' he said. Officials have not come to a conclusion, he
said, raising questions from Senate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's astounding that $140 million in additional revenue could
be misplaced in the mail,'' the senators said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Genuario, R-Norwalk, a ranking member of the
Appropriations Committee, called the inference ''political
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   The state should be able to calculate the surplus definitely in
a week to 10 days, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the budget that was adopted, the first $10 million over
and above the $250 million surplus already spent would go toward
wiring classrooms for the Internet. Any extra would be used to
avoid issuing debt for school construction.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats said they support those uses for the surplus,
but feel extending the tuition freeze another year would cost just
a fraction -- $7.5 million, according to the nonpartisan Office of
Fiscal Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition has been frozen at the schools since 1998, but that
policy will end in June.
</P>
<P>
   The four senators also are calling for a portion of the
additional surplus to be shared with cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers called any plans to create new spending
programs irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure there are legislators who, within a couple of hours,
had a hundred ways to spend it,'' Genuario said. ''It seems to me
that virtually every legislator has acknowledged at one time or
another that one of state's fiscal problems is it has one of
highest debts per capita in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Bob Ward said increasing a one-time grant
to cities and towns may not be the best way to help them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best plan for new money,'' said Ward, R-Northford, ''is to
avoid debt and reduce the temptation to spend it as soon as it's
found.''

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Visas May Be Increased  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A consensus has emerged in Congress to
increase the number of visas given to foreigners with prized
technical skills, such as computer programmers and electrical
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Going through several competing measures Tuesday, the House
Judiciary Committee cobbled together a bill that would remove visa
limits for the next three years, a move favored by high-tech
companies that say they desperately need workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is general agreement that the economy of this country is
best served by some sort of increase,'' said Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to earlier bills, the compromise would not require
federal regulations that industry officials worried would block
them from hiring any foreign workers. The committee lacked a quorum
for final approval of the bill, but an expected vote Wednesday
should send it to the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill already has cleared the Senate Judiciary
Committee and awaits action as early as this week in the full
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The progress in both chambers is a significant change from the
reluctance in previous years to increase the number of visas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the widest change is that the debate seems to have
moved away from whether we need more to exactly how many and
exactly what conditions are being attached to that,'' said Harris
Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
   H-1B visas are given to foreigners with college degrees and
allow them to work in the United States for up to six years. The
number of visas is capped at 115,000 this year, but is scheduled to
fall to 107,500 next year and 65,000 per year after that.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech industry officials say at least 300,000 jobs are going
unfilled for lack of qualified U.S. applicants. They note this
year's visa allotment was filled by mid-March, less than halfway
through the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions contend the industry is looking overseas chiefly to
hold down wages.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise bill from Reps. Lamar Smith, R-Texas; Sheila
Jackson Lee, D-Texas; and Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., would remove the
limit on the visas for three years and set a minimum salary of
$40,000 for the jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Companies would have to document $250,000 in assets to
participate in the program and conduct annual reviews of wages for
their American workers to ensure they either stayed the same or
rose. A $150 fee increase for each visa would be divided between
the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the State Department
to combat fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Smith backed off on his earlier requirement that the Labor
Department come up with oversight regulations for the program
before any more visas are issued.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my judgment, this bill represents a balance. It addresses
both the needs of high-tech companies and the concerns of American
workers,'' said Smith, a skeptic of the high-tech worker shortage
who said he was giving the industry ''the benefit of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said a few ''rough edges'' need to be removed from the
bill, such as the requirement to document average wages.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., criticized the compromise for
failing to offer training for American workers. She had suggested
raising the visa fee from $500 to $1,000 to generate $100 million
for educating and training American workers so they can fill the
vacant high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bill before us falls far short of what we need,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers complained minorities are ignored by the
high-tech industry. The compromise bill would have the General
Accounting Office study minority recruitment in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is HR4227.

<HEADLINE> FDA: No Evidence Drug Led To Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- There is no evidence that substandard imports
of a well-known antibiotic led to 17 deaths, Food and Drug
Administration officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., sent a blistering letter to FDA
Commissioner Jane Henney on Monday contending her agency did not
take aggressive enough steps to stop imports of substandard
gentamicin from China.
</P>
<P>
   The letter arises from an investigation by Bliley's House
Commerce Committee of the importation of raw pharmaceutical
ingredients. Many active ingredients for prescription medicines are
sold in bulk form by overseas companies to U.S. manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is substantial evidence of imported counterfeit or
substandard bulk drugs silently infiltrating the U.S. health
delivery system, and harming the American people,'' Bliley wrote.
His example: gentamicin, an antibiotic used most often to treat
life threatening heart infections and blood poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the FDA halted bulk gentamicin imports by a Chinese
company, Long March Pharmaceutical, citing contamination with a
substance called endotoxin that caused 130 cases of fever, chills
and low blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But Bliley charged that tainted gentamicin may still be entering
the country. He said FDA documents list 17 deaths among gentamicin
patients between May 1, 1999, and Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
   No deaths appear related to the tainted imports, and there is no
evidence that tainted gentamicin is still entering the country, FDA
drug chief Dr. Janet Woodcock responded Tuesday. ''We believe the
current supplies of gentamicin are safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA collects reports of deaths and then must determine if
medications or the patient's original illness are to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 17 deaths cited, five were duplicate reports and seven
discussed non-Americans using gentamicin sold abroad, FDA officials
said. Of the remaining five U.S. deaths, one was a premature infant
with a deadly lung infection and the other four people suffered
kidney problems, a well-known gentamicin side effect, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent pharmaceutical industry globalization ''has upped the
ante for us'' in ensuring drug safety, Woodcock acknowledged. But,
''we have programs in place to try and screen out and prosecute
people who would import inappropriate drugs into the U.S.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Ukrainian Leader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton met with Ukrainian Prime
Minister Viktor Yushchenko on Tuesday, urging him to continue
market and democratic reforms that the eastern European nation
began after the breakup of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Yushchenko met with Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger during a four-day visit to Washington
to drum up support for his government as it juggles an unsteady
economy and heavy debt. Yushchenko also outlined Clinton's trip
next month to the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president praised Yushchenko for Ukraine's progress,''
said Mike Hammer, a national security spokesman at the White House.
''He encouraged Yushchenko to continue on this path and he
encouraged their efforts to integrate Ukraine more fully into the
rest of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Yushchenko met with World Bank President James
Wolfensohn, who said that support for Ukraine hinges on tangible
progress on reform. Wolfensohn noted that the World Bank already is
working with Yushchenko's administration on a so-called Country
Assistance Strategy that will underpin future bank assistance and
lending to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expressed a strong desire on our part to assist the
government in its efforts to plan and implement its proposed
economic and social program, but I also stressed that, in
determining continued World Bank support, much will depend on
results in implementing the program,'' Wolfensohn said.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's sister institution, the International Monetary Fund,
granted Ukraine a $2.21 billion loan in September 1998 and boosted
that amount to $2.6 billion in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The money was offered as temporary support for the government
during a period of dwindling export income, stemming from the
Russian financial crisis and also the war in Kosovo, which cut
important trade routes in the region.
</P>
<P>
   However, the IMF froze loan installments to Ukraine in September
last year, citing concerns about the pace of economic and fiscal
reform. Relations between Kiev and its international lenders
worsened earlier this year when it was revealed the Ukrainian
central bank had misled the IMF over the size of its foreign
exchange reserves between 1996-1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Ukrainian authorities released a report by
auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers into the central bank's activities
during this period, showing that reserves were overstated but that
there no signs of illegal use of the funds.

<HEADLINE> Moms March Stirs Up Gun Issue  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With thousands of mothers set to rally against
guns, the National Rifle Association has opened an ad campaign that
portrays its members as mainstream Americans who want to bring gun
safety lessons to the nation's classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In a television and newspaper ads running across the country
this week, the NRA dismisses policy disagreements as ''gun
politics'' and says it will spend $1 million to educate children
about gun safety. It asks viewers to match it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every kid in every school deserves gun safety education. And
together, we can make that happen,'' NRA activist and actress Susan
Howard says in the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Playing off Sunday's Million Mom March for gun control, Howard
points to $1 million contribution: ''That's a million NRA moms,
challenging a million more moms just like you to put up just a
dollar each.''
</P>
<P>
   The money is aimed at bringing the NRA's Eddie Eagle gun safety
program, or its equivalent, to every American school, suggesting
that both sides of the charged debate could agree on that much.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, gun control groups compare Eddie Eagle to Joe Camel,
saying the program is really meant to entice kids and develop
future gun buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eddie Eagle is a gun industry salesman masquerading as a gun
safety mascot,'' said Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the
Violence Policy Center, a gun control group that issued a study of
the program in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sugarmann said the program was fundamentally flawed because it
is funded by gun manufacturers and because it does not talk about
the dangers of guns, only telling kids to stay away from them and
tell an adult if they see one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eddie Eagle never says guns can kill,'' Sugarmann said
Tuesday. ''You have to warn of the risk to have an effective safety
message.''
</P>
<P>
   An NRA spokesman, Jim Manown, said the program is appropriate
for elementary school-aged children and said many people contribute
to the foundation that funds the program, not just gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   Manown said he didn't know how much had been raised for the
group's gun safety program since the campaign began Sunday. He also
wouldn't say how much money the group was spending to air the TV
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, a bill to require the licensing of most gun buyers
was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. It
would cover buyers of handguns and some semiautomatic weapons and
would mandate that records for sales of each be kept.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time has come to say enough is enough and demand of
Congress the passage of common sense gun laws,'' said Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   New gun laws, including tighter sales and mandated child safety
locks, have been stalled in Congress for months.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the issue has been thrust to the top of the
presidential election debate in recent days as presumptive nominees
Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush trade barbs on the
topic.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which
oversees the nation's public housing developments, guns have almost
become a full-time diversion.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo called a news
conference to display hundreds of guns that have been turned in to
police as part of a HUD-sponsored gun buyback program in 43 cities.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Cuomo called on Bush to clarify whether he would
pursue new laws to protect gun makers from liability lawsuits if he
became president.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also is counting on this weekend's planned
Million Mom March organized by Donna Dees-Thomases of New Jersey to
generate new political pressure on behalf of its gun control
measures.
</P>
<P>
   The march, however, has drawn some critics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The justification for the level of coverage spawned by this
event exists only in the hype-generated universe created by people
with a direct interest in raising the red herring of gun control as
a solution to youth violence,'' said Rep. Robert Barr, R-Ga. ''The
message the media is sending is subtle but effective: Supporting
gun-control is a maternal duty, and women who oppose it are
unworthy of the responsibility of motherhood.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Presidents Back Clinton on China  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an extraordinary assembly of Republican and
Democratic administrations spanning three decades, former
Presidents Ford and Carter closed ranks Tuesday with President
Clinton to push for a China trade deal that appears increasingly
likely to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want the voice of this meeting to echo across the country
and to embrace the Congress,'' Clinton told more than 200 VIPs in
the chandeliered East Room. ''I wish it weren't a fight, but it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before the House opens debate on granting China
permanent trade benefits, supporters of the proposal were
optimistic about winning. ''We're confident that we will get there
on the votes,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   To prevail, the bill requires 218 votes in the 435-member House
if all members vote. Both sides say the vote will be extremely
close. If the House passes the measure, Senate approval is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Republican sponsors say they expect to deliver 140 to 145 votes
-- but that Democrats must supply the rest. Democratic sponsors
predict they will get 70-80 Democratic votes.
</P>
<P>
   Among opponents, Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., groused that the
measure will pass because organized labor is ''soft-pedaling'' its
criticism of Vice President Al Gore, whose presidential race has
labor's support, while running attack ads against House Democrats
who favor the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two House members -- Reps. Sander Levin, D-Mich., and
Doug Bereuter, R-Neb. -- late Tuesday proposed companion legislation
to set up a new procedure for measuring China's behavior. It calls
for a congressional-executive commission that would monitor human
rights and labor practices in China and make recommendations that
presumably could include proposing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   China-trade advocates in both parties have said that the side
package could improve the overall prospects for the China trade
bill by providing political cover to those now on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It addresses some very justifiable concerns,'' said Rep. David
Dreier, R-Calif., chairman of the House Rules Committee and a
leading supporter of the China trade bill. ''I'm confident the
final product will help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton collected support at the White House from a who's who of
the foreign policy establishment from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   There were four former secretaries of state: Henry Kissinger,
Alexander Haig, James Baker and Warren Christopher. Two former
secretaries of defense: Robert McNamara and James Schlesinger.
There were former ambassadors, national security advisers, Cabinet
secretaries and scores of others from the worlds of politics,
business and the religious community.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger, acknowledging the diverse views present, said some
guests ''could not even charitably be described as colleagues.''
But he said, ''We are united on one proposition. Six American
presidents, of both parties, have concluded that cooperative
relations with China serve the national interest of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   In a strong voice, Ford, 86, warned of dire consequences if
Congress denied permanent trade benefits to China -- part of an
agreement in which Beijing pledged to lower trade barriers and
tariffs on American goods in return for U.S. support for China's
entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''A negative vote in the House and-or the Senate would be
catastrophic, disastrous to American agriculture, electronics,
telecommunications, autos and countless other products and
services,'' said Ford. ''A negative vote in the Congress would
greatly assist our foreign competitors from Europe or Asia by
giving them privileged access to China markets and, at the same
time, exclude America's farm and factory production from the vast
Chinese market.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, 75, addressed objections raised by labor and religious
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''China still has not measured up to the human rights and
democracy standards and labor standards of America,'' said Carter.
''But there's no doubt in my mind that a negative vote on this
issue in the Congress will be a serious setback and impediment for
the further democratization, freedom and human rights in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush has also endorsed the trade package, but
he did not attend the White House ceremony. White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said Bush called Monday to say he couldn't make it
because of a longstanding schedule conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we vote for this, 10 years from now, we will wonder why
this was a hard fight,'' Clinton said. ''And if the Congress votes
against it, they'll be kicking themselves in the rear 10 years from
now because America will be paying the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose commitment to the trade deal has been questioned,
gave an unequivocal endorsement: ''It is right for American jobs.
It is right for the cause of reform in China and I believe it will
move us closer to the strong and stable world community we all seek
to create.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking out at the audience, Gore said Clinton had called upon
''the collected wisdom of the elder statesmen'' and that they
''have all come to the same conclusions. And I just think that a
gathering like this ought to have such tremendous weight in the way
people analyze issues.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the top two House Democratic leaders oppose the
legislation, asserting it will hurt U.S. jobs. Labor and human
rights groups say an annual review of China's trading privileges
gives the United States leverage over China's human rights,
environmental, religious and labor policies.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional opponents held a news conference with actress
Goldie Hawn to say they still hope to defeat the measure, with
House Democratic Whip David Bonior contending opponents were
gaining strength among Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a problem with the human rights policy in China,'' Hawn
said. ''I don't want to give them a bone any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior, D-Mich., criticized Carter for supporting the measure,
suggesting the former president was undermining his own credentials
as a human rights activist. ''He needs to stand with the people who
are struggling to make China free and open,'' Bonior said.

<HEADLINE> AG creates inspector general to monitor government activities  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The attorney general Tuesday created a new
state position -- inspector general -- to monitor government
practices and prevent corruption and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John J. Farmer named Edward Neafsey, who is
currently the insurance fraud prosecutor, to the post.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general will be able to make recommendations on
management practices and examine procedures for inefficiencies. He
also will investigate tips and will likely oversee complex state
issues like allegations of racial profiling by the State Police,
Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   And, if he can't prevent misdeeds, he'll have the power to
prosecute them.
</P>
<P>
   Neafsey will supervise a staff of 30 attorneys, investigators,
accountants and management specialists. The office will have the
power to subpoena witnesses and file civil lawsuits, as well as
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer decided to create this post after his office was called
to investigate the racial profiling charges and dealings that led
to a faulty new auto emissions inspection service, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general is especially needed now, as the state
considers ''significant expenditures'' for school construction and
open space, Farmer said. Such large-scale public spending has
potential for not only graft, but mismanagement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''History is history. There have been problems in the past and
we would like to think that the presence of a watchdog would
prevent some of that,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   If the state proceeds with the multibillion dollar school
construction plan, the inspector general would examine contracts
and local bidding ''to make sure cronyism does not enter into the
equation,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just to make sure whatever is being done is being done in the
right way,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman called the new office a ''win-win for New
Jersey taxpayers'' and pointed to the ''power to investigate
allegations of fraud, waste, abuse and misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It will also be able to detect errors and irregularities in
state programs, apply preventative maintenance and fix things
before they are broken,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, such duties were handled ''on an ad hoc basis,''
Farmer said. Racial profiling was reviewed by an internal team in
his office. To examine how a California company, Parsons
Infrastructure, wound up the lone bidder on the problem-plagued
auto emissions program, Farmer appointed a former state Supreme
Court justice. Currently, the State Commission of Investigation
probes organized crime and official corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Early in her first term, Whitman abolished the Office of the
Public Advocate, a state financed agency that often tackled
government on behalf of private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The highest ranking Democrat in the state Senate said that does
not lend credibility to this newest reform agency, which Sen.
Richard J. Codey, D-Essex, called the ''inspector corporal.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the State Commission of Investigation, the inspector
general would report to the attorney general, Codey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason the SCI is effective is because it has the autonomy
to investigator outside the control of the politicians,'' Codey
said. ''It is ludicrous to suggest the fixed term of the attorney
general makes the office nonpolitical.''
</P>
<P>
   Neafsey was the first person to act as the state's insurance
fraud prosecutor, a post created in 1998. Before that he was chief
of the Environmental Crimes Bureau in the Division of Criminal
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's shown the ability to get something up and running on a
short-time basis,'' Farmer said. ''All in all he's the perfect guy
for the job.''

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Finally Rebound  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices broke their six session losing
streak, as investors swooped in to buy at depressed prices and
higher yields amid a down day in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell \ point,
or $2.50 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction, fell to 6.52 percent from 6.56 percent late
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Treasury bond fell 15/32 point to yield 6.21
percent, down from 6.24 percent late Monday, according to Bridge
Telerate.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in bonds was considered by many a technical bounce as
traders looked to take advantage of attractive yield. But many
expect downward pressure on bonds to continue due to concerns the
Federal Reserve will enact several more interest rate hikes this
year to cool down the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates and higher inflation both hurt investments
with fixed returns, such as bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds also looked more enticing Tuesday amid falling stocks
prices. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 66.88 to 10,536.75 on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading Monday, short-term Treasury securities rose
1/32 point to 1/16 point, while intermediate maturities were
between unchanged at up \ point.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 6.13 percent as the
discount fell 0.06 percentage point from Monday's Treasury auction
to 5.96 percent. Six-month yields were 6.43 percent, as the
discount was unchanged at 6.15 percent from Monday's auction.
One-year yields were 6.30 percent as the discount fell by 0.01
percentage point from Monday to 5.00 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, fell to 5.81 percent from 6.00 percent late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell [ to 92 7/16. The average yield to
maturity rose to 6.19 percent from 6.18 percent.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate rejected a compromise offered by
moderate Democrats to consolidate more than 40 federal education
programs and target money to poor students, but unanimously
approved a Republican plan to protect teachers who discipline
students from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   The future of the entire education bill -- governing about $20
billion in federal aid to schools -- was left uncertain as the
Senate then turned its attention to other legislation governing
trade with Africa and spending on military construction. It may be
a week before the Senate comes back to the education plan -- and the
gun-control proposals it could still draw.
</P>
<P>
	   ''There's been good debate; it's my intent to come back to
elementary and secondary education,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said Tuesday after postponing further votes on the
bill. Education's popularity in voter polls has turned the normally
bipartisan renewal of the 35-year-old Great Society law into an
election-year public relations war between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
	   ''Education has been a victim of its own success,'' said Joel
Packer, a lobbyist for the National Education Association. He said
if lawmakers can't agree on education policy bill before the end of
this session, they may use upcoming spending bills to push their
agendas and keep school programs funded.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the Senate overwhelmingly rejected, 84-13, a
long-standing attempt by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., and eight
other moderate Democrats, to bridge the gulf between Republicans
seeking increased local control of education dollars and fellow
Democrats pushing specific federal programs. In six days, senators
approved just two changes to the version offered by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton has promised to veto the GOP's first shot at
rewriting the law, angered mostly over Republican attempts to
dilute his teacher-hiring plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Lieberman, who spent more than a year promoting his ''third
way'' plan, said Tuesday his colleagues had the chance to
accomplish more than lengthy arguments about who controls spending.
</P>
<P>
	   ''It may be stimulating,'' Lieberman said. ''It may be
fascinating. It may even be educational. But if it's only a debate
without a result, it does nothing really for the children of our
country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., another backer, said the plan increased
federal education spending and targeted most of those new dollars
to the poorest school districts.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the end, the plan -- waved under the flag of the moderate
Democratic Leadership Council founded by Clinton -- was an
alternative few senators wanted.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., said the plan cut into priorities set
by the president and reduced funds for poor students in 30 states.
Just 13 of 45 Democrats voted for the Lieberman bill.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no Republican support for it, not even from moderates
who have crossed party lines to vote with Democrats on other social
issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ''This proposal pits poor children of one school against poor
children in another,'' said Sen. James Jeffords, D-Vt., chairman of
the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP conservatives ultimately decided they could not back away
from plans to let poor children use federal funds for vouchers and
other options if their schools are failing to help them.
</P>
<P>
	   The vote on teacher liability protections, backed by Lott and
Rep. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., was 97-0. Sponsors said it would help
teachers regain control of classrooms routinely disrupted by
chronic misbehavior.

<HEADLINE> Threatened by casino road deal, A.C. laundry gets a reprieve  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- In casino-era Atlantic City,
businesses who do battle with the gambling industry face long odds.
It is, after all, a casino town.
</P>
<P>
   But everything is coming up aces for Atlantic City Linen Supply
Inc., a commercial laundry that stood in the way of a road-widening
project aimed at improving access to Boardwalk casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Resorts Atlantic City agreed to donate land, Tropicana Casino
and Resort provided a $2.5 million loan and the state Casino
Reinvestment Development Authority pitched in with money for new
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The $7.5 million deal will allow the company, which had eyed
locations in Pleasantville and Vineland, to build a new plant that
remains within walking distance from home for most of the 300
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very happy ending: We stay in Atlantic City, and our
employees keep their jobs,'' said David Goldberg, co-owner.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1986 in a sprawling 19th century building at
North Carolina and Adriatic avenues, Atlantic City Linen stood in
the way when the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority and the
state Department of Transportation came up with a plan to widen
North Carolina Avenue, a key access road for incoming casino
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 million road project, covering about a half-mile, would
force the re-location of Atlantic City Linen. With relocation help,
the business could do just as well elsewhere, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A job's a job, no matter where it's located,'' said James
Kennedy, executive director of the Casino Reinvestment Development
Authority. ''Early on, we argued it should be in another
municipality. But the mayor and the City Council president felt
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic City Linen, it turns out, is more than a local
business. It is the city's largest non-casino private sector
employer, and 80 percent of its employees live in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some of the employees are people who might be
unable to find work in the casinos because of language barriers,
criminal backgrounds or other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we moved, they wouldn't be able to come with us,'' said
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Atlantic City Linen serves the casinos, cleaning
and pressing 100,000 pounds of table linens, serving jackets, chef
whites and other items a day.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement between the Casino Reinvestment Development
Authority, Resorts and Tropicana, Atlantic City Linen got a 20-year
lease on a Delaware Avenue parcel that is owned by Resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Construction will begin in two weeks on a new 63,000 square-foot
building. Goldberg hopes to open the new building by next February.
Then the road-widening project will start.
</P>
<P>
   ''This place is like a family,'' said Laurie Ruiz, 33, a veteran
employee. ''I'd have hated to leave.''

<HEADLINE> UN Seeks Peace in Horn of Africa  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) -- Hinting at a possible breakthrough, a
U.N. delegation led by U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke shuttled
between the capitals of Eritrea and Ethiopia on Tuesday in an
attempt to avert a new round of fighting between the two Horn of
Africa neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation held talks with government officials in the
Eritrean capital Asmara early Tuesday then flew to the Ethiopian
capital later in the day to confer with Ethiopian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the issues are resolved,'' Holbrooke said after the
talks in Asmara, adding that a few technical differences remain
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia
already has cost the lives of thousands of soldiers and civilians
from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   After indirect talks between the two sides ended bitterly last
week in the Algeria, Ethiopian officials warned ominously of a
return to war, sparking the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the delegation's apparent progress on Tuesday -- one day
after three hours of inconclusive talks in with Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi -- Holbrooke remained cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sit on the edge of a vast and useless war,'' said
Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-member delegation was to return to Asmara early
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries agree on a framework peace accord drafted by the
Organization of African Unity, but they disagree on how to
implement it. Eritrea wants a cease-fire before working out the
details. Ethiopia says it will not agree to a cease-fire until
everything else has been agreed on.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the United States was drafting a Security Council
resolution urging both sides to abide by the OAU framework
agreement, U.S. officials said. The resolution is expected to be
adopted after the council delegation wraps up its talks in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin accused
Eritrea of derailing the talks in Algiers. He said Eritrea had
demanded a cease-fire before it would move on to other matters.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi told
foreign diplomats in a private briefing that his country's options
were shrinking quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who say force is not an option should show the way to
peace,'' a diplomat present at the briefing quoted the prime
minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethiopian statements -- as well as reports of Ethiopian troop
reinforcements moving toward the border -- spurred an emergency
session of the U.N. Security Council on Sunday night in New York
and the Holbrooke-led delegation's visit to the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of renewed hostilities in the Horn comes at a
time when a major drought in the region threatens an estimated 7.7
million people with severe food shortages.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presents Football Trophy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton presented the U.S. Air Force
Academy with the commander in chief trophy on Tuesday, praising its
football team for winning the shiny silver award nine of the past
11 years.
</P>
<P>
   The trophy, established in 1972, is awarded to the military
service academy with the best record in the annual ''round-robin''
football competition. The academy in Colorado Springs, Colo., has
won 28 games during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to be completely neutral in these things, but the Army
really was hurt that you beat them this year -- with a better ground
game,'' Clinton joked.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six members of the Falcons football team, dressed in blue
uniforms, were recognized during the ceremony in the Rose Garden of
the White House. Members of the team gave the president a blue team
hat and football jersey emblazoned with his name and the number
one.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Meets On Joint Strike Fighter  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of Defense William Cohen sought to
head off a new congressional threat on Tuesday to the development
of a $220 billion warplane, but a Senate panel decided to put
restrictions on how quickly funds are spent on the Joint Strike
Fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Gen. James Jones, the commandant of the Marine Corps,
met behind closed doors with members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee in a plea to keep the plane off the endangered list.
</P>
<P>
   The fighter, one of the most expensive planes ever to be built,
has come under criticism from congressional cost-cutters recently,
a year after Congress came close to killing off the Air Force's
cherished F-22 ''Stealth'' bomber.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon hopes to develop three new fighter jets for the
future: the F-22, the Joint Strike Fighter and the Navy's FA-18 E
and F jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
   While the House Armed Services Committee has backed the
Pentagon's $856 million request for the Joint Strike Fighter for
next year, some members of the Senate panel have threatened to
delay the program.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va.,
called the Joint Strike Fighter ''vital to America's long-term
national security interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, after listening to Cohen and Jones, the panel
''agreed not to include any legislative prohibition'' against
developing the fighter in the fiscal year 2001 defense budget it
has been working on this week.
</P>
<P>
   However, the committee voted to shift funds for the plane from
the engineering and manufacturing phase, as the administration had
wanted, into the less advanced phase of ''demonstration and
validation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The committee remains concerned about the pressure'' on the
Pentagon to move too quickly to production, Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said that, ''as the program continues and new information
is developed,'' the Pentagon could have the funds reprogrammed.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the defense secretary ''the flexibility to move
forward when the program is ready for the next phase,'' Warner said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The jet is expected to become the principal fighter jet of the
Air Force, Navy, and Marines. The services plan to buy about 3,000
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. are competing for the
contract to build the jet, some of which will be sold to Britain.

<HEADLINE> Charges Dismissed Against Hughes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOME, Australia (AP) -- Dangerous driving charges against art
critic and author Robert Hughes were dismissed by a magistrate
Tuesday, ending a year-long legal ordeal that followed a car crash
that almost killed him.
</P>
<P>
   After a two day trial in the town of Broome, Magistrate Antoine
Bloemen said prosecutors had failed to prove beyond reasonable
doubt that Hughes had caused the crash, which left him in a coma
for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the occupants of the other car sustained serious injuries
while the third suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting back tears, Hughes whispered ''thank you'' and ''thank
God'' as Bloemen read out his decision to the court.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, 61, had been charged with dangerous driving causing
grievous bodily harm in the accident that occurred on a deserted
stretch of highway near Broome on May 28 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian-born Hughes, an art critic at Time Magazine and
author of the book ''The Fatal Shore,'' was in the state of Western
Australia filming a television series for the British Broadcasting
Corp. at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Lloyd Rayney alleged Hughes had caused the crash by
driving on the wrong side of the road, plowing head-on into the
oncoming car after ignoring warning signs such as flashing
headlights and horn honks.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the court, Hughes said he was relieved the case was
over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am extremely glad that justice was done -- and it was done --
and seen to be done,'' Hughes told journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very wise and very decent decision by the magistrate,
obviously, how could I find any fault with it whatsoever.''

<HEADLINE> High ozone mixes with pollen, packing hospital ERs  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Gasp! The rare combination of heavy spring
pollen, polluted air and a summer-like heat wave sent dozens of
people with respiratory problems to New Jersey hospitals Monday and
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency department workers and ambulance staff, particularly
in northeastern and southwestern New Jersey, where air quality
usually is worst, were swamped by patients with asthma attacks,
wheezing, chest pains and heart troubles exacerbated by hot, smoggy
air.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is spring pollen season and we're having inordinately hot
weather for this time of year. I don't recall the two ever being so
(bad) together,'' said Dr. Bernard Goldstein, director of the
Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute in
Piscataway.
</P>
<P>
   One unidentified man, found unconscious from heat stroke on a
Newark street Monday afternoon, remained hospitalized in critical
condition Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   At Cooper Hospital/University Medical Center in Camden, 20
patients, most with weather-related problems, walked into the
emergency department in one five-minute stretch at midday Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We truly have just been inundated today. It started late
yesterday afternoon and has progressively gotten worse,'' said
Karen Slutsky, clinical manager of Cooper's emergency department.
''I can't even quantify it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we're trying to figure out where we're going to find beds
for all the people here,'' she added, because the hospital is full.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures hit about 90 degrees across most of New Jersey
again Tuesday. Air quality plummeted as sunlight combined with heat
and pollutants from autos, factories and power plants to produce
dangerous levels of ozone. At ground level, ozone is a pungent gas
that inflames lungs and breathing passages and sets patients up for
respiratory infections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Temperature, pollution and pollen: When you mix the three
together, you set up a chain reaction in the lungs'' that can be
very dangerous for anyone with allergies or lung disease, said Dr.
Leonard Bielory, director of the Asthma &AMP; Allergy Research Center
at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in
Newark.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the next 24 to 36 hours, people are just going to get
sicker,'' Bielory predicted.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, according to the Department of Environmental
Protection's forecast, air quality on Wednesday again will be
''unhealthy for sensitive groups:'' the elderly, children and
anyone with respiratory or heart disease. The department on Tuesday
issued air quality warnings for unhealthy levels of ozone and soot,
or particulate matter, in Bergen, Passaic, Essex, Hudson, Union,
Camden and Gloucester counties.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, tree pollen counts remain extremely high -- about
1,800 pollen grains per cubic meter Monday and about 1,200 Tuesday
in Newark. Counts of 200-500 are considered high.
</P>
<P>
   At University Hospital in Newark, spokesman Rogers Ramsey said
the emergency department treated 20 people Monday and another seven
Tuesday for wheezing, asthma attacks and other respiratory
problems.
</P>
<P>
   One, an unidentified man found unconscious and with an elevated
body temperature, was being treated for heatstroke in the intensive
care unit. The 40-ish black male had not regained consciousness by
Tuesday evening. Ramsey said the man was found at 5th and Orange
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Even in areas where air quality was moderate, or just below
unhealthy, some hospitals felt the weather's effects. At Monmouth
Medical Center in Long Branch, the emergency department has been
extremely busy since Sunday with lung and cardiac patients, said
hospital spokeswoman Kathy Horan.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials were urging people to try staying in air
conditioning, limit exercise and drink extra water to avoid
becoming dehydrated.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein added that people with respiratory problems should do
outdoor activities before 10 a.m., when ozone begins building up,
or after it dissipates in the late evening.
</P>
<P>
   While the heat wave is expected to break Wednesday night, the
pollen onslaught won't.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Jinnoti, a professor of biomedical engineering at Robert
Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, predicted ''a very
bad year'' for pollen because the mild winter and early spring
rains primed plants for growth spurts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have an extremely high ragweed season,'' he
added, unless a dry spell hits in June and July.

<HEADLINE> S.America Backs Off Single Currency  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL ASTOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- South America's troubled trading
bloc backed away Tuesday from adopting a single currency, saying
the region first had to more closely align its economies.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil and Argentina, the largest participants in the Mercosur
pact that also includes Paraguay and Uruguay, announced a first
step toward bringing their economies in line as a possible
preparation for a unified currency. The two nations said they would
standardize their ways of measuring finances and set common fiscal
targets by March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The World Economic Forum's Mercosur Summit opened Sunday with a
great deal of expectation after Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso called for re-launching the troubled trade bloc
and for a single currency in the ''medium term.''
</P>
<P>
   But two days later, Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan said
the single currency is ''putting the cart before the bull.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The time frame will be as long as it takes. Our style is not
to hurry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fiscal measures are intended to help revive Mercosur, which
was hurt by Brazil's Jan. 1999 currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Following the devaluation, trade within the bloc dropped by 20
percent, which was especially hard on Argentina where 30 percent of
exports go to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The devaluation made products from Argentina, where the currency
is pegged to the U.S. dollar, almost twice as expensive in Brazil,
disturbing the trade balance and causing Argentina at one point to
slap unilateral trade barriers on shoes and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   The move prompted many here and in Argentina to declare Mercosur
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Today, anti-Brazilian sentiment in Argentina runs high as dozens
of companies move operations to Brazil, where labor costs are
cheaper. And many economists believe Mercosur is inoperable as long
as Argentina holds on to its dollar peg.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Gov. Bush Signs Tobacco Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ROYSE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush signed legislation
Tuesday to ease the pain for tobacco companies facing a possible
multibillion dollar verdict in a Miami class-action lawsuit they
say may force them into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which took effect immediately, is meant to protect
the companies so they can continue to pay Florida billions they owe
the state from the 1997 settlement of a lawsuit seeking
compensation for years of paying to treat sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The amount the companies owe is estimated at $13 billion over
the next 25 years. The state has gotten accustomed to having the
money, about $500 million a year, for children's and elderly
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Of immediate concern to lawmakers and Bush is a case in Miami in
which a class of sick Florida smokers and ex-smokers that may reach
500,000 people has sued the industry seeking their own damages.
</P>
<P>
   The jury in that case is expected to begin considering punitive
damages against cigarette makers next week. The jury became the
first in the nation to decide in favor of smokers as a class when
it awarded compensatory damages in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has said the damages might reach $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The measure signed by Bush caps the bond the companies would
have to post to appeal the verdict at a $100 million or 10 percent
of the companies' net worth, whichever is lower.
</P>
<P>
   The law also sets up a mechanism by which lawmakers may begin
selling off part of the future tobacco income to investors if they
choose to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wasn't available for comment after signing the bill.

<HEADLINE> Florio backs plan to create New Jersey's first National Forest  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- U.S. Senate candidate Jim Florio Tuesday
promised to sponsor a wholesale freeze on development in
northwestern New Jersey to create the state's first National
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   In his announcement, Florio continued to maximize his ties to
the Sierra Club. He joined club officials, who did most of the
explaining about the plan to use federal funds to buy some 300,000
acres in New Jersey and New York over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Club has endorsed Florio in his Democratic primary
contest with Jon Corzine. The other major environmental group in
New Jersey that makes endorsements, the New Jersey Environmental
Federation, may make an announcement by week's end, according to
director David Pringle.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine spokesman Steve Goldstein said his candidate has
endorsed any steps necessary to preserve land in the so-called
''Highlands'' region, and has been more aggressive on the matter
than Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups are among the most active nonprofit
agencies at work at the Statehouse and on the New Jersey policy
scene, yet they shrink from the field during election campaign
season.
</P>
<P>
   Clean Ocean Action, the New Jersey Conservation Foundation and
the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, all with thousands
of dues-paying members, shy away from campaign endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Audubon is a nonprofit group and so cannot endorse
candidates, said Bill Neil, the group's director of conservation.
</P>
<P>
   The Communications Workers of America local representing state
employees at the Department of Environmental Protection has
endorsed Corzine. However, Local 1034 political director Jeff Scott
said the endorsement was based more on union and state worker
issues than on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said the rarity of ''green endorsements'' gives the
Sierra Club nod extra weight among voters who are primarily
concerned about such issues.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Florio is throwing his weight behind one of the
Sierra Club's national priorities, the formation of the first
National Forest that would encroach on the populous northeastern
corridor from Washington, D.C., to Boston. Currently there are no
federal forest lands in the 450 miles between Green Mountain
National Forest in Vermont and George Washington National Forest in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   As a congressman, Florio was central in the establishment of the
Pinelands National Reserve covering a million acres in southern New
Jersey, a persistent controversy because it imposed stringent land
regulation without purchasing the forests and swamps it intended to
save.
</P>
<P>
   He said Tuesday this approach would not work in northern New
Jersey, adding that political times are more opportune to propose
some $250 million in outright federal spending over 10 years to buy
undeveloped land.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said, ''It is a different time and a different era, and
the fact is there is just too much private land here'' when
compared with the Pine Barrens tracts he worked to save through
regulation 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra
Club, said the targeted Highlands region covers about a million
acres ranging from Phillipsburg on the Delaware River north through
forest valleys east of the Kittatinny Ridge into New York State and
east to West Point on the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   A third of that land is already preserved, the single largest
piece being in the Harriman-Bear Mountain State Park in New York.
The National Forest plan would preserve, more or less intact, a
patch of forest to link Harriman with New Jersey's Delaware Water
Gap National Recreation area, a zone Tittel called essential to
protect water reservoirs supplying 4.5 million New Jersey
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck McGrady, national chairman of the Sierra Club, attended
the news conference here to say the National Forest has been a top
national priority for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said Florio's support for the National Forest proposal
is late and an act of political convenience, claiming Corzine had
endorsed it more heartily from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jon was a forerunner in this position, and it is nice to see
Jim is a Jimmy-Come-Lately on this,'' Goldstein said. ''We are
grateful the Sierra Club has knocked some sense into him.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Leaders Offer To Resign  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's top military commanders have
offered to resign, four months after the high command refused to
put down an abortive rebellion that toppled the president,
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Telmo Sandoval, head of the joint chiefs of staff, Vice
Adm. Enrique Monteverde, head of the navy, and air force Gen.
Ricardo Irgoyen presented their resignations to President Gustavo
Noboa on Monday, a government news release said without providing
further details.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Hugo Unda told reporters that Noboa was
considering candidates to replace the top military commanders, but
refused to elaborate. Noboa assumed the reigns of government after
President Jamil Mahuad was ousted on Jan. 21 by a military-backed
uprising.
</P>
<P>
   The news came as Congress started debate on Noboa's request to
offer amnesty to military officers involved in January's aborted
coup.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Simon Pachano said the resignations of top
military leaders and the offer of general amnesty was a step toward
ending divisions within the military and repairing its damaged
image.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad was forced from power after hundreds of Indian
protesters, backed by a cadre of young army officers, occupied the
empty Congress building and proclaimed a ''Parliament of the
People.''
</P>
<P>
   The military high command refused to put down the insurrection
and forced Mahuad from power to avoid ''a social explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Former armed forces chief Gen. Carlos Mendoza, who had joined
the junta, turned power over to Noboa, Mahuad's vice president,
under pressure from the U.S. State Department and at least 20
regional commanders who opposed the overthrow of civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the resignation list Tuesday was Gen. Norton
Narvaez, commander of Ecuador's ground forces, who joined the
military high command after the rebellion and was widely perceived
as not involved in Mahuad's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Military tribunals are trying 17 military officers, most of them
colonels, for their part in Mahuad's unconstitutional ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, who resigned his post, said later that he agreed to
join the coup as a stall tactic until democratic order could be
restored.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's high military tribunal is considering whether to
pursue charges against Mendoza and dozens of other officers for
possible court martials.
</P>
<P>
   Some political parties, including the influential Social
Christians, oppose a general amnesty, but Ecuador's powerful Indian
movement has demanded that its allies in the military be cleared of
all charges.

<HEADLINE> House Bill Targets Sex Trade  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House passed legislation Tuesday to help
thousands of foreign women and children forced into the sex trade
in the United States and crack down on their victimizers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fifty-thousand innocent women and young children are forced,
coerced, or fraudulently thrust into the international sex trade
industry with no way out,'' said Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J.,
the chief sponsor. ''This legislation will put these offenders
behind bars while protecting the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which passed by voice vote, would double to 20
years the maximum penalty for enticing and selling people into
involuntary servitude, and add the possibility of life imprisonment
when violations result in death or involve kidnapping or sexual
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It makes trafficking victims eligible for the federal Witness
Protection Plan and creates a new visa status for victims who
cooperate with law enforcement. Those entering this program, which
would be capped at 5,000 people a year, would be able to apply for
permanent residence after three years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also directs the State Department in its annual country
reports on human rights to include information on the levels to
which countries combat or tolerate human trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The president would have the authority, beginning in 2002, to
withhold nonhumanitarian aid to countries that fail to meet minimum
standards in eliminating the sex trade. The administration opposes
the bill based on this provision, but Smith stressed that the
president would also have the discretion to waive this authority.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 50,000 to 100,000 women and children brought into
this country every year for sexual exploitation are a small part of
the 2 million victims of the international sex industry. Smith said
an estimated 250,000 women and children from Russia, the newly
independent states and Eastern Europe are trafficked into Western
Europe, the Middle East, Japan, Canada and the United States each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he and Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., a co-sponsor,
recently talked to several women who had been held as ''virtual
slaves'' in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is so frustrating,'' Gejdenson said, ''is that often the
laws we have punish only the victims.'' He said the women often end
up getting arrested or deported while those who force them into the
sex industry go free.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation is under consideration in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 3244.

<HEADLINE> Teacher of Year Named  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Marilyn Jachetti Whirry started teaching
English in a California classroom 35 years ago, she tossed the
desks into the hallway and brought in beanbag chairs. The maverick
high school teacher replaced lectures with group discussions and
mixed classics with paperbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The school's principal, and even some of Whirry's colleagues,
didn't always support such unorthodox attempts to be a better
teacher: ''They just didn't like kids bothering them with other
questions. I was sort of alone for the first couple of years.
Still, I started causing some waves.''
</P>
<P>
   Whirry, 65, was named Tuesday the 2000 National Teacher of the
Year -- an honor she won for educating pupils at Mira Costa High
School in Manhattan Beach, Calif., and helping train their teachers
as well. With her title, she delivers a simple message for how the
public should treat teachers: more training, more pay, more
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think we come home at 3 and kick our shoes off,'' said
Whirry, who was California's teacher of the year for 1999. ''I
begin teaching at 7 in the morning before most people are up.''
</P>
<P>
   Her evenings and weekends are spent reading essays and planning
lessons; her summers, traveling the country as a consultant
training other teachers to help students read and write better.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of us have master's and Ph.D.s,'' Whirry said in an
interview. ''We could be out somewhere else, but we think education
is the most important thing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what people have to understand,'' she said. So far, she
said, ''We show respect in our society by how much people earn.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the major teachers unions, which have opposed merit-pay
plans, Whirry said she could support some proposals that would give
successful teachers an edge in salary scales. She is a union
member, but Whirry said such plans don't necessarily have to pit
teachers against one another.
</P>
<P>
   ''The merit pay issue is workable if it's done fairly,'' she
said. ''But many teachers are afraid of it. Sometimes I think
teachers are too afraid of change.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers have to learn that it's OK to be out of the classroom
for professional development, said Whirry, who has attended and led
teacher training workshops over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ''If one missed day leads a teacher to grow and learn and know
more, it's wonderful for the kids,'' she said. ''The message has to
be sent out loudly and clearly that teachers need staff
development.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We would be afraid to go to a doctor who hadn't kept up with
changes in his profession,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, teachers have increasingly vented their
frustration with conditions of the profession. Teachers earn less
than other professionals. The stress of standardized tests and
zero-tolerance discipline policies also take their toll, even on
top teachers like Whirry.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of past national and state teachers of the year, released
Tuesday, suggests even teachers who are considered the best clamor
for more pay, support from parents and administrators and respect
for the jobs they do. The first-ever poll of top teachers has a
margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Educators responding to the poll said teachers are bothered most
by excessive paperwork, nonteaching responsibilities, burned-out
colleagues and low staff morale. Fewer faulted large class sizes or
the learning abilities of today's students.
</P>
<P>
   Whirry, who teaches advanced 12th-grade college-preparatory
classes, said teachers need to take more charge of their own fate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's bad public relations,'' she said. ''We don't tell people
all the things that we do.''
</P>
<P>
   She will spend a year on promotional tours as teacher of the
year, being launched with a ceremony Thursday at the White House.
The Teacher of the Year award is sponsored by the Council of Chief
State School Officers and Scholastic Inc., the educational
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Whirry says she is fortunate that Mira Costa, where she has
spent most of her career, is in a community that supports teachers.
Manhattan Beach is an upper-middle-class suburb; few of the 2,100
students at the high school get free or reduced lunch -- the most
common measure of student poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But, Whirry said, her travels have taught her that any
community, with the right amount of encouragement, can help its
schools and teachers. She's invited parents in to observe her
classes and offered them summer courses on reading strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes a difference when parents know they are wanted and
needed,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Drifter Executed in Texas  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A drifter from Oklahoma was executed
Tuesday night for beating, raping and killing a woman 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   William Kitchens, 37, admitted strangling 25-year-old Patricia
Webb of Abilene and shooting her through the eye. After a federal
appeals court refused to overturn his conviction and sentence last
September, he asked that no additional appeals be filed for him.
</P>
<P>
   Just before his lethal injection, Kitchens apologized to his
victim's family and asked God to forgive him ''for the despicable
things I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitchens, an eighth-grade dropout who worked in construction and
as a painter, met the victim at a nightclub where she was attending
an office party. When the group left, Webb offered to take Kitchens
to his motel so he wouldn't have to pay for a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchens admitted in a recent interview that Webb, who was
married to a firefighter, had ''made it clear she was not going to
fool around.'' But he said he wanted to scare her, ''to let her
know she shouldn't just go with someone to a motel room.''
</P>
<P>
   He raped and killed her and drove off in her car. He was
arrested at his parents' home and gave officers directions to a
wooded site where they found Webb's body.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchens was the 14th inmate executed in Texas this year.
Another execution is set for Thursday.

<HEADLINE> State wants to overturn federal court ruling halting sex offendernotices  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The state attorney general filed papers
Tuesday arguing that a federal court ban on sex offender
notifications harms New Jersey residents more than offenders would
be hurt if the notices were allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia on April
18 halted the public disclosures allowed under Megan's Law. Federal
Appellate Judge Dolores Sloviter issued the order while the court
reviews the law.
</P>
<P>
   That review came a week after a U.S. district judge approved
changes that the state made in the notification process to ease
concerns that offenders' privacy rights were violated. Neighbors in
a carefully defined area were given the offender's name, age,
street address and other information.
</P>
<P>
   The state's public defender's office claimed in a class-action
lawsuit that the street address was too much private information
being made too public.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Irenas agreed in part earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of appealing that ruling, Attorney General John J.
Farmer Jr. offered the court new guidelines requiring people who
receive such notices to sign forms saying they will not disclose
the information. Those who don't sign do not get the exact address.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Irenas approved those modifications, ''it's not clear
what the 3rd Circuit is doing,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   A motion filed with the appellate court asks that the order
staying the notifications be vacated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The harm to the community, by not having these notifications,
outweighs the harm that would be suffered by any infringement on
the privacy rights of the defendants,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls seeking comment from a spokesman for the public defender
were not returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling last year written by Sloviter, the 3rd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals said Megan's Law was all right, provided
reasonable steps are taken to make sure that information about sex
offenders was given only to neighbors who were authorized to
receive it.
</P>
<P>
   Sloviter said people have a constitutional right to keep their
home address private, and that authorities must take steps to
protect this right when conducting door-to-door notifications about
sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law is named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old Hamilton
Township girl who was raped and murdered in July 1994 by a
convicted sex offender who lived across the street from her Mercer
County home.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, sex offenders who are released from prison or who
move into New Jersey are required to register their address, and
officials seek to conduct limited notifications to neighbors or
area schools, according to their assessment of the risk that the
offender might pose to others.
</P>
<P>
   For high risk offenders, police conduct door-to-door
notification with name, address, photo, criminal record and other
details. For those deemed moderate risk, notifications are limited
to area schools, daycare centers, Little Leagues and other
facilities or organizations that have custody of children.

<HEADLINE> Refugees Flee Sierra Leone Town  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- United Nations peacekeepers,
followed by frightened refugees, have retreated from a key village
outside this West African capital, U.N. officials said Tuesday,
while regional leaders met in Nigeria in an effort to defuse the
week-old crisis threatening to push Sierra Leone once again into
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers withdrew from Masiaka, 45 miles east of
Freetown, on Monday after exchanging gunfire with unknown attackers
and running out of ammunition, U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said.
Word of the retreat did not reach Freetown for more than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   While rebels of the Revolutionary United Front are believed to
be in the region, it was unclear if they were responsible.
Helicopter reconnaissance showed the city was completely empty
Tuesday afternoon, Wimhurst said, but added: ''Freetown is not
going to fall to the RUF.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of refugees from the Masiaka area had reached the edge
of Freetown by Tuesday afternoon, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In this seaside city, word of the fighting broadcast over the
radio quickly spread fear through the city after what had been a
peaceful Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are so worried ... that we heard that the rebels had
attacked Masiaka and Masiaka is so close to the city,'' said Edward
Moseray, a civil servant.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the country's rebel leader, Foday Sankoh,
added to the gloom. He had been under U.N. guard before Monday's
shooting outside his Freetown home. The rumor mill had Sankoh
anywhere from the Sierra Leonean jungle to an army safehouse, but
U.N. officials said they did not know where he was.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are anxious to find a way to contact him,'' Wimhurst told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Sierra Leone has become increasingly chaotic
since a Nigerian-led regional intervention force pulled out last
week. Since then, clashes have broken out intermittently between
peacekeepers and rebels and some 500 peacekeepers are being held
hostage by the RUF. At least one peacekeeper is believed to be
dead.
</P>
<P>
   In Abuja, Nigeria, presidents from around the region met to try
to defuse the crisis. They condemned the recent rebel moves but
fell short of ordering additional troops into Sierra Leone.
Instead, they called for a ministerial summit to be held next week
in Nigeria to discuss the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued afterward and signed by nine presidents from
the region said they ''expressed their determination to use all
means at their disposal, including the military option, to foil any
attempt to take over power through the use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the United States had sent a ''fact-finding'' team
to Nigeria on Monday to assess what help the U.S. military might
provide if Nigeria or other African nations decide to augment their
peacekeeping role in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the United
States is not considering sending any combat troops to Sierra
Leone, but he confirmed news reports that the Clinton
administration has told the United Nations it is willing to provide
air transportation for a battalion of 700 to 800 peacekeepers from
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the United States might also help transport
additional peacekeepers from Jordan and India. He said it was not
yet clear what other kinds of military assistance the United States
might provide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Specifically, the types of help we will provide remain to be
determined because it depends on what the UN and the international
community, including the regional countries in West Africa, decide
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a U.N. spokesman said the three remaining
battalions appear ready to deploy by next week, which would bring
the U.N. force up to its full strength of 11,100.
</P>
<P>
   British helicopters, meanwhile, continued swooping into Freetown
on Tuesday, ferrying out frightened Britons.
</P>
<P>
   In London, a Ministry of Defense spokeswoman said about 320
British, European Union and Commonwealth citizens had been
evacuated so far. They were flown to Sierra Leone's main airport
and then most were taken by airplane to Dakar, the capital of
Senegal, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, the crowds of evacuees had thinned but some were
still waiting to be flown from a helipad near the now heavily
militarized Mammy Yoko hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations late Monday began evacuating some of its 266
nonessential civilian employees. Another 55 were staying in
Freetown, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the evacuations and Monday's clashes, the streets of
this seaside capital were calm Tuesday, with many stores open and
people moving about freely.
</P>
<P>
   At least four demonstrators were gunned down by rebels Monday
when thousands of rock-throwing marchers headed for Sankoh's house,
though doctors at Freetown's main hospital said 20 people had been
killed over the past night, and 54 more had gunshot wounds. It
wasn't clear, though, how many had been killed in the initial
gunfire and how many in other incidents. At least some of those
killed are believed to be rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leonean army soldiers, who under a July peace plan are
supposed to be disarmed, and fighters from the pro-government
Kamajor militia, fought the rebels for hours at Sankoh's home after
the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings in Freetown, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
described Sierra Leone's peace process as being in ''deep
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Miyet, the head of U.N. peacekeeping operations, arrived
in Freetown on Monday night and was meeting U.N. soldiers and
officials to assess the situation and ''to demonstrate to ... the
world that we're determined to put the peace process back on
track,'' Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone, among the world's poorest countries despite vast
diamond resources, was brutalized during eight years of civil war,
which ended with a peace accord last July that created a
power-sharing government. In principle, that deal included the
rebels and Sankoh, whose forces killed and maimed thousands during
the war.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon: Militia Chief Must Give Up  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- The commander of Israeli-allied
militiamen in southern Lebanon must surrender and stand trial for
treason before demanding amnesty for his men, the prime minister
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is strange that Antoine Lahd is asking the president for a
general amnesty (for his militiamen) while he is still carrying out
attacks alongside the enemy of his country, against civilians of
his country, and sometimes does not spare the army of his
country,'' Prime Minister Salim Hoss said in a statement issued by
his office.
</P>
<P>
   Hoss' statement came a day after Lahd, commander of the South
Lebanon Army militia, or SLA, appealed to President Emile Lahoud to
grant his followers a general amnesty similar to a 1991 pardon of
militiamen across Lebanon for most crimes committed during the
devastating 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Israel plans to withdraw from an enclave it occupies in south
Lebanon by July 7, leaving the fate of Lahd's militia, which is
financed, armed and trained by the Jewish state, uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Prime Minister Ehud Barak expressed support for
Lahd's demands in an interview with Israel Radio on Tuesday. The
aspiration of SLA fighters for a collective and personal amnesty
must be met, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We of course feel responsible to see that the issue of the SLA
is resolved in a way that befits their deep connection with the
state of Israel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his appeal Monday, Lahd maintained that he alone bore
responsibility for the actions of his 2,500 fighters, but he did
not indicate whether he would be willing to stand trial after the
Israeli pullout. Lahd, a retired Lebanese army general, was
sentenced to death in absentia in 1996 after being found guilty of
treason by a Beirut military court.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Lahd) must firstly turn himself over to the Lebanese
judiciary before asking for anything,'' said Hoss. ''He knows that
if he does so, he will be treated by the judiciary with justice,
transparency and the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon, which is technically at war with Israel, prohibits
contacts or dealings with the Jewish state. Collaboration with
Israel is punishable by imprisonment in most cases. Treason is
punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed guerrilla group leading the
campaign to oust Israeli troops and the SLA from south Lebanon, has
said if the SLA remained in control of the border area after the
withdrawal, attacks would continue.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, a U.N. special envoy discussed Israel's planned
withdrawal with the Arab League's secretary general on Tuesday. The
envoy, Terje Roed-Larsen, said the United Nations is ready to
deploy peacekeepers in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel Meguid said he had
told the envoy that the Israeli withdrawal should be ''complete,
unconditional and swift.''

<HEADLINE> Methodists Review Abortion Policy  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD N. OSTLING, AP Religion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A panel of the United Methodist Church, the
nation's largest religious body that favors abortion rights, voted
Tuesday to fight a late-term procedure opponents call
''partial-birth'' abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The issue now moves to the full conference for a vote, expected
by the end of the week. Though the full conference could decide
otherwise, it usually passes committee recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was approved by the committee 77-32. It opposes the
late-term procedure except when the life of the mother is in danger
and no other procedure is available, or in cases of severe fetal
abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   During emotional debate before a packed gallery, the Rev.
Gregory McGarvey of Greenfield, Ind., said: ''I stand to use my
voice for those who have no voice. We offer them no voice when we
use this procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. J. Philip Wogman of Washington, Hillary Clinton's
pastor, said ''my concern is both with the health and well-being of
the mother and the medical profession if we put this into law
without qualification. The effect can be very chilling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Methodists' General Conference meets every four years to set
policy for the country's second-largest Protestant denomination,
with 8.4 million U.S. members and 1.2 million adherents overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The conference's hottest issue, homosexuality, reaches the floor
Thursday. The same panel that dealt with abortion will be reporting
out bills to maintain current opposition to homosexual practice.
</P>
<P>
   Gay and lesbian activists plan a protest Wednesday during the
appearance of Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, spiritual
leader of 70 million Anglicans and Episcopalians worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Methodist traditionalists won significant long-term
leverage in elections to the denomination's supreme court, which is
likely to face important decisions on homosexuality. For instance,
a 1998 ruling by the court gave a ban on same-sex union ceremonies
the force of law and was used to defrock a Nebraska pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in national conservative caucuses won three of five open
seats on the nine-member court, their best showing since the
homosexual issue arose.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hosts Costa Rica President  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Costa Rican President
Miguel Angel Rodriguez discussed trade, drug smuggling and other
topics Tuesday during the Central American leader's first trip to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said much of the 40-minute session in the Oval Office
concerned legislation moving through Congress that would elevate 48
nations of sub-Sahara Africa to full U.S. trading partners and
expand market access for Caribbean and Central American nations.
</P>
<P>
   The pact has passed in the House and is expected to clear the
Senate this week. Clinton intends to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said a treaty intended to stanch the flow of drugs to
the United States from Central America ''is working very well.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This year we have already stopped 283 ships in the Costa Rican
oceans and we are working in a very broad way with the U.S.
government in prosecuting the illegal drug trafficking,'' Rodriguez
said outside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   White House National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer said
the two leaders also expressed mutual concern over recent electoral
irregularities in Peru and about the status of democratic reforms
elsewhere in Central and Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Proposal Would Limit Forest Roads  </HEADLINE>
By ALISA BLACKWOOD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- The Clinton administration proposed a ban on
building roads in 43 million acres of roadless federal forests
Tuesday -- a decision that prompted complaints from both
environmentalists and timber industry officials.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 300 miles of planned logging roads would no longer
be built under the proposal, said Agriculture Undersecretary Jim
Lyons. That would eliminate at least 53 percent of the timber
cutting that would otherwise occur in the forests, his office said.
</P>
<P>
   But to the disappointment of environmentalists, local federal
forestry officials would get to decide whether to allow logging,
mining or off-road-vehicle riding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our objective is really to preserve and protect the values
that draw millions of people each year to the forests that they
love,'' Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck said in announcing the
proposal in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ''These pristine areas are some of the last wild places in
America, and I am firmly committed to preserving them for future
generations,'' President Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 million acres of the 192 million acres of federal
forests are considered wild, or undeveloped. The rest of the
acreage is host to a wide range of activities, including logging,
camping, skiing and mining.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say roads cause runoff, disrupt plant and
wildlife and make it easier for logging, mining and
off-road-vehicle riding.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, local forest officials would make the final call
on what activities would be allowed. The plan also would leave it
up to local foresters to decide whether roads should be banned in
smaller forest parcels of 5,000 acres or less.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said the proposal falls short of the
protection they had hoped for, since banning roads won't in itself
stop logging -- timber companies could use helicopters and cable
systems to log forests.
</P>
<P>
   ''While it prevents future road building, it still allows
logging and continued off-road vehicle use,'' said Rob Smith, a
spokesman for the Sierra Club in Phoenix. ''That can be as
destructive as anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry groups also complained, saying the proposal limits
their access to forests. ''It's another step toward zero harvest,''
said Jim Geisinger, president of the Northwest Forestry Association
in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The forest protection plan requires no congressional action,
relying on regulations to be issued by the Forest Service after an
environmental review and public comments.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal could gain final approval at the end of the year,
just before Clinton leaves office. But environmentalists expect
Republicans in Congress to try to delay the rulemaking until after
Clinton's term. Court challenges from industry groups are likely.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most controversial parts of the plan involves
deferring a decision until 2004 on whether to prohibit roads in 8.7
million acres in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the Tongass ''just leaves a gaping hole in this
policy,'' said Matt Zencey, campaign manager of the Alaska
Rainforest Campaign.

<HEADLINE> Official: Elian Shouldn't Be Used  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three days after 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez got
visiting-head-of-state treatment at the home of a wealthy
Democratic contributor, President Clinton's spokesman said the
Cuban castaway ''should not be exploited or paraded around for
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart did not directly rebuke Smith
and Elizabeth Bagley, both prominent Democratic fund-raisers and
Clinton intimates, for inviting the boy to a Saturday night dinner
at their Washington home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know the arrangements. I don't talk to his lawyers
about what plans they have, so I just am in no position to really
comment,'' Lockhart said. ''But you know, let's be clear here. He
should not be exploited or paraded around for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith Bagley, an R.J. Reynolds tobacco heir and foundation
president, and his wife, a former Clinton ambassador to Portugal,
did not return several telephone requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his family left the secluded Maryland estate where
they are awaiting U.S. action on the boy's immigration case and
came to the Bagleys' elegant Georgetown home by police-escorted
motorcade. U.S. marshals accompanied the boy, and the street around
the Bagley home was blocked to other traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's lawyer, former Clinton impeachment attorney Gregory
Craig, also attended the dinner. The rest of the guest list is
unclear, but Lockhart challenged a question about whether other
Democratic donors might have viewed the gathering as a perk.
</P>
<P>
   ''What basis do you have for alleging that?'' Lockhart said
angrily during his daily briefing for reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, why else would a bunch of 20 very rich Democratic fund
raisers want to, you know, be at a house to meet Elian Gonzalez?''
a reporter replied.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has become the focus of a heated international custody
fight since he was rescued last Thanksgiving from a boat wreck that
killed his mother and others who fled Cuba. Clinton supported the
Justice Department raid that snatched the child from the home of
Miami relatives last month. The relatives wanted to keep Elian in
the United States, and the boy's father wants to take him back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Miami there was a media circus atmosphere'' surrounding the
boy, Lockhart said. ''And the idea of bringing the boy out and
sitting down with reporters and doing videos, that certainly was
close to the exploitative line.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how close the four-hour Bagley party came to exploitation,
Lockhart again replied that he is unfamiliar with arrangements for
the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what the relationships are,'' Lockhart said.
''But I'm making the point that the young boy should not be
exploited.''

<HEADLINE> LA Judge Delays Thai Toddler Return  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT JABLON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge Tuesday delayed the
deportation of a 2-year old Thai boy believed used in an
immigration smuggling scheme. The move came hours after a Thai
consular official attempted to pick up the boy for a flight home.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian issued a temporary
restraining order on the day Phanupong Khaisri was to be returned
to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, Phanupong's caretakers rebuffed a Thai consular
official at the home where the boy is staying, then sued the U.S.
government to block his removal.
</P>
<P>
   Phanupong has been in the United States since April 11, when he
arrived at Los Angeles International Airport accompanied by a
couple pretending to be his parents. The adults were deported after
it was determined they were not his relatives or guardians.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said they believe the adults were posing as
tourists and using the boy as a prop in a scheme to smuggle a
Chinese woman into the country as an indentured servant.
</P>
<P>
   Peter A. Schey of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional
Law, which sued, said caregivers were concerned that ''given the
level of corruption'' in Thailand, if the boy is sent back he could
end up in the ''stream of illicit trafficking'' again.
</P>
<P>
   Tevrizian scheduled a hearing for May 23. In the meantime, he
said he would appoint two specialists to examine the boy, who
caregivers say is recovering from an ear infection.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing the temporary restraining order, Tevrizian cited
allegations that the boy had been sold to smugglers and said he
wanted to ensure the toddler would have a safe home when he returns
to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't, as a parent ... just simply return this child back to
Thailand after what this child has been through,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Trimark OKs Amvescap's Takeover Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Canadian mutual fund giant Trimark Financial
Corp. announced plans Tuesday to merge with global money-management
firm Amvescap PLC of Britain in a deal worth $1.81 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will create Canada's second-largest mutual fund
company and ends weeks of speculation as various Canadian and
global firms were rumored to be in the hunt for Trimark.
</P>
<P>
   ''Trimark is pleased to have the opportunity to partner with a
global investment manager of Amvescap's stature,'' Trimark chairman
Robert Krembil said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Headquartered in London, Amvescap is one of the world's largest
independent investment managers with $392 billion in assets under
management. Amvescap already runs AIM funds in Canada, and the
company wanted to expand its Canadian operations.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, a combination of cash and shares, values Trimark's
shares at about $18 each, Amvescap said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement follows a weak period for Trimark, whose
value-oriented investment style has been out of favor in
technology-propelled stock markets, prompting heavy shareholder
redemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Trimark Financial reported Tuesday that its revenue for the year
ended March 31 fell 10 percent, to $367.3.
</P>
<P>
   Trimark is Canada's sixth-largest mutual fund company with $16.6
billion in assets; AIM Canada is ranked 14th with $6.4 billion
under management.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, must be approved by regulators and both companies'
shareholders, is expected to close in late summer.
</P>
<P>
   Trimark manages more than 57 mutual funds with more than 800
employees in offices in the Canadian cities of Toronto, Vancouver
and Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Amvescap is one of the world's largest independent investment
managers. Operating under the AIM and Invesco brands, the company
has more than 5,700 employees in more than 100 countries.

<HEADLINE> Cuba: US Backed Off Elian Visa Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba claimed Tuesday that Elian Gonzalez's
grandparents had planned to visit him in the United States but
abandoned the trip when the State Department didn't issue them
visas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the State Department
communicated with our Interests Section (in Washington) that the
visas would not be granted and that a decision was being postponed
for an indefinite period,'' according to a government statement
read on state television.
</P>
<P>
   But a State Department press duty officer said Tuesday night in
Washington that she had no information on the Cuban announcement
concerning Elian's grandparents and their visas.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, State Department representatives both in Washington
and Havana had said visas would be granted on Tuesday or Wednesday
at the latest, according to the Cuban government statement.
</P>
<P>
   The grandparents had hoped to spend time with the boy at Wye
Plantation in Maryland, where he is staying with his father,
stepmother, half brother and others from their Cuban hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at the center of an international custody dispute
since late November, when he was found floating off the coast of
Florida lashed to an inner tube.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, traveled to the United
States on April 6 in an attempt to retrieve his son and return with
him to Cuba. He was reunited with Elian on April 22 after federal
agents raided the home of their Miami relatives, where the boy was
staying.
</P>

   They have stayed in the United States since then pending the
appellate court decision on the Miami relatives' request that the

</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives want Elian to stay with them in the United
States, arguing that they can give him a better life off the
communist island. Gonzalez wants to return to Cuba with the boy,
claiming his rights as the child's sole surviving parent.

Hideo Hamamura
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Hideo Hamamura, who won the 1955 Boston Marathon,
died Sunday of cancer. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Hamamura finished in 2 hours, 18 minutes, 22 seconds to set what
was then a course record, beating the old mark by 29 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Benefiting from a light rain and a soft tail wind, Hamamura,
then 26, was never challenged over the final four miles of the race
to become the third of seven Japanese champions in the 104-year
history of the Boston Marathon.

Richard Heyza
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Richard ''Dick'' Heyza, who saw life through his
camera in more than half a century as a newspaper photographer in
Detroit and Seattle, died Sunday of complications following knee
surgery. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   At age 16 Heyza was an errand boy at the now-defunct Detroit
Times and eventually worked his way up to a job as photographer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961 he moved to Seattle and taught photography at the
University of Washington for a year until a position opened at the
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way he was punched in the face by Detroit mobsters,
trampled by Special Olympics runners and attacked outside a Seattle
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   After winning a number of awards, Heyza retired in 1991. He
donated a variety of prints to the new Hollywood Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his daughter, three sisters and two brothers.

Warren Jobe
</P>
<P>
   FOSSIL, Ore. (AP) -- One of the oldest veterans of World War I,
Warren Jobe, died Thursday of congestive heart failure. He was 110.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Jobe received his basic training near the end of the war,
but the war ended before he saw combat. He was mustered out of the
Army in 1918 in Tacoma, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Army, Jobe homesteaded in Eastern Oregon and
kept cattle, sheep and horses.
</P>
<P>
   During the Great Depression, he was forced to leave the
homestead and take a job at a sawmill in Kinzua, 11 miles south of
Fossil.

<P>
Marcia Kaplan
</P>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa.,(AP) -- Marcia Kaplan, an award-winning
television reporter most well-known as the hostess of central
Pennsylvania's ''Romper Room,'' died Sunday of complications from
ocular melanoma. She was believed to be in her late-60s.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan was the first woman to appear on a hard news television
program in central Pennsylvania and won several awards for news and
public service during a 15-year broadcast journalism career.
</P>
<P>
   But she was most recognized as Miss Marcia on the local
children's show ''Romper Room'' in the 1960s. For eight years,
Kaplan was a teacher who entertained youngsters in the studio
audience with the help of ''Do Bee'' and ''Don't Bee.'' She talked
to children watching from home by pretending to view them through a
magic mirror.
</P>
<P>
   After ''Romper Room,'' she was the hostess of ''That's Life,''
''From Where I Sit'' and ''Take 5.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan was the first television journalist to win the
Pennsylvania Bar Association's William A. Schnader Award in 1974
and was the 1975 recipient of the American Bar Association's Gavel
award.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the Pennsylvania Association of Broadcasters cited
Kaplan's ''Take 5'' as the Best Community Services program in the
state. She was the recipient of the first National Public Affairs
award given by the federal government in the mid-Atlantic region.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a brother, sister and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
John P. Robin
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- John P. Robin, a driving force behind the
city's transformation from a smokestack town to a modern urban
center, died Sunday. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Although he never held elected office, Robin played a key role
in the development of the city's skyline during his 50-year career
as a civic leader. The developments he helped guide include Gateway
Center, Point State Park and the Light Rail Transit system.
</P>
<P>
   Robin served in numerous positions, including executive
secretary to two Pittsburgh mayors, the first executive director of
the Urban Redevelopment of Pittsburgh and chairman of the Port
Authority for nearly 20 years. He was the primary supporter of the
city's Renaissance rebuilding efforts in the 1940s and 1950s and
again in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Ruth D. Turner
</P>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Ruth D. Turner, a Harvard University
professor and diver who became an expert in wood-eating mollusks,
died April 30. She was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, affectionately called Lady Wormwood, wrote more than 100
publications, almost all of them on teredos, a species of mollusks
commonly called shipworms.
</P>
<P>
   Shipworms are known for devouring sunken ships and wooden piers.
</P>
<P>
   Turner worked with Robert Ballard, who discovered the Titanic,
and determined that shipworms were the reason so little wood
remained in the wreck.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Police Said Demoralized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Police have become demoralized and less
aggressive since officers shot and killed an unarmed black woman in
her car in late 1998, a grand jury reported after a seven-month
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury report, released Monday, said criticism of the
shooting has made police reluctant to even engage in traffic stops
and pay diligent attention to white-collar crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''Officers are not investigating suspicious or possible criminal
activity in order to avoid use-of-force confrontations,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   It also found no evidence of rampant racism within the Riverside
Police Department and said that if anything, the department suffers
from unfair discipline practices that favor minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some minority officers have violated department policies with
impunity. The absence of uniform disciplinary actions is common
knowledge among the officers and has also had a poisonous effect on
morale,'' the grand jury report said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the department called the report one-sided, accusing
the grand jury of relying too heavily on police testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''They knew where they wanted to go before they conducted the
investigation,'' said former Police Chief Jerry Carroll, who
resigned this year after weathering a storm of criticism following
the shooting of 19-year-old Tyisha Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was struck by 12 bullets as she lay in a parked car on
Dec. 28, 1998. The officers involved said they opened fire when she
lunged for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting led to regular protests in this city 60 miles east
of Los Angeles, with some protesters and community members saying
it was racially motivated. Miller was black. The officers were
white and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds like the grand jury is trying to bail out the
Riverside Police Department,'' said the Rev. Burnell Butler,
Miller's cousin. ''They are useless, just taking up space.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury recommended the department hire more officers,
provide better training and implement a discipline review panel. It
did not charge anyone.

<HEADLINE> Firemen Push To Kill N.M. WildFire  </HEADLINE>
By PETE HERRERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUIDOSO, N.M. (AP) -- Aided by a brief lull in winds,
firefighters accelerated efforts Tuesday to extinguish two
wildfires that forced hundreds of evacuations and scorched more
than 9,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Winds died down on both fires, near Los Alamos in northern New
Mexico and near the southern resort town of Ruidoso. But the
National Weather Service said winds would rise again Wednesday and
really get roaring Thursday with gusts of up to 50 mph in Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't contain the fire today, the likelihood of it
jumping and going across into Los Alamos Canyon is really high,''
said Frank Hayes, one of five division supervisors on the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Evacuees were allowed to return home to some neighborhoods
Tuesday -- but with the warning that they should not spend the
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos fire was started by the National Park Service to
clear brush at the nearby Bandelier National Monument but spread
out of control. It slowly grew to 3,365 acres Tuesday, and the
eastern edge of the fire burned to Los Alamos National Laboratory's
property line. The lab was closed for a second day and was to stay
closed Wednesday, as were Los Alamos schools and county offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Ruidoso fire grew to 5,700 acres Tuesday. It was started by
a campfire; authorities would not release details of their
investigation.

McCain Backs Bush, Nixes Sharing Ticket
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- While comparing the action to taking a dose of medicine,
Sen. John McCain today endorsed George W. Bush, his rival in the Republican
primaries. McCain said that he doesn't want to be Bush's running mate. Behind
their smiles, the strains from a bitter Republican primary fight were still
apparent. Even as McCain said he looked forward to ''enthusiastically
campaigning'' for the presumptive GOP nominee, the vanquished rival had to be
prompted before using the word ''endorse.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an extraordinary assembly of Republican and Democratic

ranks today with President Clinton to push for a China trade deal that appears
increasingly likely to pass. ''We want the voice of this meeting to echo across
the country and to embrace the Congress,'' Clinton told more than 200 VIPs in
the chandeliered East Room. ''I wish it weren't a fight, but it is.'' Two weeks
before the House opens debate on granting China permanent trade benefits,
supporters of the proposal are optimistic about winning.

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- United Nations peacekeepers, followed by
frightened refugees, have retreated from a key village outside Freetown, U.N.
officials said Tuesday, while regional leaders met in Nigeria in an effort to
defuse the week-old crisis threatening to push Sierra Leone once again into
civil war. The peacekeepers withdrew from Masiaka, 45 miles east of Freetown, on
Monday after exchanging gunfire with unknown attackers and running out of
ammunition, U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said. Word of the retreat did not

along with his son Stephen of fraud and racketeering. The scheme took place

17 of the 26 counts, including two racketeering charges that each carry 20 years

Marine Corps commandant, said in an interview. ''Everything appears to have been
working normally'' at the time of the accident.

   TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Creeping floodwaters sent Oklahomans scrambling to
salvage what they could as schools closed and roads disappeared under water
today after a second round of heavy storms hit the northeast corner of the
state. Downpours that left 2 to 4 inches of rain in the region pushed creeks and
their tributaries over their banks in four counties. As the water continued to
rise in Vinita, tractor-trailers were pulled up to the fronts of a few homes to
haul out furniture and belongings. The flooding was the runoff of heavy rains in
Kansas.

<HEADLINE> Israel Singled Out By UN Statement  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A draft statement prepared by a U.N.
conference on nuclear disarmament has singled out Israel for being
the only country in the Middle East that hasn't signed onto the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The draft, which is still subject to revision before the
conference wraps up next week, also notes that subcontinental
neighbors India and Pakistan, which conducted nuclear tests in
1998, haven't signed and urges them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The statement would be one of the final statements from the
conference reviewing implementation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty, which requires nuclear powers to work toward disarmament
while forbidding non-nuclear countries from obtaining nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, India and Pakistan have come under intense criticism at
the conference for having failed to sign the treaty despite having
nuclear capabilities. Cuba is the only other country that hasn't
signed.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt has led the effort to single out Israel as the only
country in the region that hasn't committed itself to the treaty,
which requires countries to allow the International Atomic Energy
Agency to inspect their nuclear facilities to make sure they are
being used for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The United States managed to head off direct criticism of Israel
at the last treaty review conference in 1995 -- primarily because
there were other countries in the region that still hadn't signed
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States was unable to do the same this time around
and appears to have conceded that it couldn't prevent Israel from
being named if it wanted to single out India and Pakistan for their
nuclear weapons tests.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have only said they wanted a ''fair and
balanced'' resolution that mentioned not only the countries that
haven't signed the treaty but those that have signed and aren't
abiding by it.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq and North Korea are both mentioned in the draft as having
failed to give the IAEA complete access to its suspected nuclear
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding India and Pakistan, the draft calls on both countries
to sign onto the treaty and refuses to acknowledge that they are
''nuclear powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has neither confirmed nor denied it possesses nuclear
arms, saying the mystery serves as a deterrent. Israel says it
wants to work out issues of nuclear disarmament -- as well as
disarmament of weapons of mass destruction -- regionally.
</P>
<P>
   The draft statement notes that all countries in the Middle East
have signed the treaty except Israel, urges Israel to follow suit
and ''without further delay, to place all its nuclear facilities
under full-scope IAEA safeguards.''
</P>
<P>
   It says the conference had agreed to appoint a special
representative to urge Israel to join the treaty and to report on
progress before 2005.

   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- A massive power outage late Tuesday

<P>
   The lights went out in Lisbon and along a 180-mile mostly rural
stretch to the Algarve coastal area around 10 p.m., according to
the national power company Electricidade de Portugal.

   The blackout ended in Lisbon after 1 hour 45 minutes but
emergency phone lines were jammed with calls.
</P>

   The power company's chief national engineer Hugo Assuncao told
state radio RDP that a technical fault occurred at a substation in
Rio Maior, 50 miles north of Lisbon, but he said the cause was not
known.

<HEADLINE> Deja Vu for the Devils?  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils aren't just
back in the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since
1995. They're playing like 1995, the year they won the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing says that better than the performance the Devils put on
Monday night in defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs 3-0 to win the
best-of-seven conference semifinals in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto had just six shots on goal against Martin Brodeur in
what arguably might have been the greatest defensive effort in NHL
history. The shot total was the fewest allowed in any game --
regular season or playoff -- since the league started its expansion
era in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, New Jersey had 27 shots, including six by Claude
Lemieux, the 1995 Conn Symthe Trophy winner.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's as close to perfect as it comes,'' Lemieux said. ''I
remember one game in 1995 that Jacques Lemaire thought was perfect,
but tonight might beat it. When you give up six shots, you're doing
something well. You're doing something right.''
</P>
<P>
   Like in '95, the secret to the Devils' success has been defense.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the physical play of Scott Stevens, New Jersey has given
up 15 goals in 10 playoff games. Opponents' top lines and players
have been all but silenced.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bure, who led the NHL with 58 goals in the regular season,
had one in the Devils' first-round sweep of Florida, while
Toronto's top line of Mats Sundin, Steve Thomas and Jonas Hoglund
had one goal in six games, after scoring 10 in the first round
against Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just didn't create enough chances,'' said Sundin, who was
blanked in the second round. ''We spent pretty much the whole
series in our own end and in the neutral zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The great debate is whether the Devils are again playing the
neutral zone trap favored by former coach Lemaire, or if new coach
Larry Robinson has them using some hybrid of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs swore it was the trap, a defense that clogs up
the center of the ice, takes skating out of the game and makes
hockey boring, except to the team that's winning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just closed the gap tonight,'' quipped Petr Sykora, whose
goal 18 seconds after the opening faceoff pretty much took the air
out of the Maple Leafs. ''You can call the trap, but it's not. It's
just playing smart.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the message Robinson has preached since replacing Robbie
Ftorek as coach on March 23 with the team slumping badly and eight
games left in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils went 4-4 under Robinson, but they have been nearly
unbeatable in the playoffs, posting an 8-2 record. They have
outscored their opponents 28-15 and allowed one power-play goal in
34 attempts, a 2.9 percent success rate.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's (Robinson) made us a more disciplined team,'' said
Stevens, who is emerging as a leading candidate for this year's
Conn Smythe. ''The past few years, we've been cheating on offense.
Now we have forwards coming back and helping out the defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Larry talks to the players a lot, and he gets results,'' added
Stevens, whose big open-ice hits had Toronto players wary entering
the Devils' zone. ''He's got the guys believing in this system.
When everyone is pulling on the same rope that way, you can go a
long way in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs certainly believe that.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are rolling right now,'' forward Garry Valk said. ''Their
defensive game is playing well, and their goalie is playing real
well, and I expect them to go far.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Lou Lamoriello also believes the Devils are
capable of winning the Cup again if they continue to play the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   But he also knows things can change quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you can look back and relate and compare (to
'95); that's the first step to disaster,'' Lamoriello said in a
telephone interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday. ''What we
are doing right now is, we are playing with a confidence and a
discipline that is needed to have success. But you have to
understand it's easy to get off track and it's difficult to stay on
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello admitted what might have made him the happiest after
Monday night's game was walking through the locker room and hearing
players say they still haven't done anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey will meet Philadelphia, which beat Pittsburgh 2-1
Tuesday to win their series in six games, in the conference finals.
The Devils won the regular season series 4-1 over the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had a lot of disappointments in the past, and we're kind
of turning the page,'' Brodeur said. ''Winning the first round was
not enough. We're there, and we're tasting it. Hopefully, we'll
keep going the same way. It's time for us to ride the wave and go
on.''

<HEADLINE> S.C. House Debates Confederate Flag  </HEADLINE>
By LEIGH STROPE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The South Carolina House spent five hours
debating a measure to remove the Confederate flag from the
Statehouse dome, but no clear consensus emerged Tuesday on the
first day of debate.
</P>
<P>
   Republican House leaders support a compromise passed by the
Democrat-controlled Senate last month that would fly a similar,
square banner at a Statehouse monument to Confederate soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   As debate got under way, an amendment favored by black Democrats
that would remove the flag and create a new bronze flag monument on
Capitol grounds was defeated 65-43.
</P>
<P>
   The House also changed the Senate bill slightly to increase the
pole's height by 10 feet to 30 feet, to add lighting to illuminate
the flag and to remove the banner at the dome at noon July 1. An
amendment to allow a nonbinding public vote in November was
defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're nearing the parameters of what can pass,'' said
Republican House Speaker David Wilkins. ''We're on track. We're at
the monument. We're staying at the monument.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's unclear if any factions have enough votes to approve a
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, I still think there are not enough votes to pass
any single idea,'' said Rep. Bob Sheheen, a Democrat and former
House speaker.
</P>
<P>
   While it was House Republicans who rebuffed previous attempts to
remove the flag, this time the opposition comes from black
Democrats who say the flag would be too visible at the monument,
which is near one of Columbia's busiest intersections.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather it stay on the dome than fly on the ground in
people's faces and create the total chaos that I know it's going to
create,'' said Rep. John Scott.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
which wants tourists to boycott South Carolina until the flag is
removed, also opposes the Senate plan.
</P>
<P>
   Some black senators said it was the best compromise they could
get.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP says the flag stands for slavery. Its supporters say
it is an important symbol of the state's heritage and honors those
who fought in the Civil War.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell early Wednesday amid lingering
worries over the outlook for U.S. stock prices. The dollar was
higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 254.98 points,
or 1.43 percent, to 17,589.56 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Tuesday, the average closed down 355.42 points, or 1.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 109.26 yen, up 0.38 yen from late Tuesday in
Tokyo but below its late New York level of 109.45 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index started lower as investors
remained bearish over continued weakness on Wall Street, where the
Dow Jones industrial average lost 66.88 points to 10,536.75 point
at Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
   Also in New York, the Nasdaq composite index closed at 3,585.01,
down 84.37.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 25.23 points, or 1.51 percent, to 1,643.91.
The TOPIX closed down 27.38 points, or 1.61 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar's strength was
based on a belief that the Federal Reserve will raise interest
rates at its upcoming meeting in a pre-emptive step to ward off
inflationary pressure
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates tend to make a nation's currency more
attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's next Open Market Committee meeting is scheduled for
May 16.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 99.16 yen, up from
97.96 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond
stood at 1.7100 percent in early trading, unchanged from Tuesday's
finish. Its price remained unchanged at 100.77.

<HEADLINE> Too high? Too fast? Sky's the limit with today's roller coasters  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SEEWER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDUSKY, Ohio (AP) -- Roller coasters that drop, twist and turn
riders at heights and speeds that were unimaginable just a few
years ago are coming under closer scrutiny amid an increase in
amusement park injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers and doctors are asking whether the human body is
built to withstand what today's scream machines dish out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology and ride design are outstripping our understanding
of the health effects of high G-forces on child and adult riders,''
said Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. ''How much force is too much
force?''
</P>
<P>
   America's theme parks are expected to draw more than 300 million
visitors this year, with about 200 million more people visiting
carnivals and fairs. Competition is driving a roller coaster arms
race of sorts -- parks want rides that can claim to be the highest,
the fastest, the steepest, the scariest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything that gets a little more scream,'' said Richard
McClary, a former federal safety inspector and now a consultant to
amusement park operators. ''I think the threshold is going to be
with the human: How much you can protect the neck and head, the
arms and legs?''
</P>
<P>
   Six people died on amusement park and carnival rides in the
United States last year, which is close to the average over the
past 25 years of five deaths a year, according to the Consumer
Product Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission estimates that 9,200 people were treated for
ride-related injuries in 1998 -- a 24 percent increase over four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Congress have proposed legislation that would allow
the government to regulate rides at the nation's biggest theme
parks.
</P>
<P>
   Regulation of amusement park rides is left to the states, but
more than a dozen have no inspection programs. Only two states --
Florida and Ohio -- have full-time inspectors. And Florida allows
the very biggest parks to police themselves. Walt Disney World,
Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, and Universal say their rides are too
sophisticated for state inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Markey noted that there are at least 16 cases cited in medical
studies of brain damage associated with riding roller coasters. In
January, the journal Neurology reported that Japanese doctors found
a woman developed blood clots after riding a roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   Theme park industry executives counter that the studies were too
limited to form any conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of being seriously injured on a ride are 1 in 25
million, according to the International Association of Amusement
Parks and Attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The industry says the death toll is small compared with the
number of people who go to theme parks and fairs. They also say
that most accidents can be blamed on riders horsing around and
breaking the rules by doing such things as standing up or trying to
get off too early.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 coasters built in the past two years will be
rolling this summer. Designers are using computers to apply
technology developed by the space program and to push the limits of
roller coasters.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brown, a California engineer and consultant who tests
roller coasters, said technology has made rides smoother and safer.
</P>
<P>
   ''They used to be designed with slide rules and calculators,''
he said. ''Now they're actually built and evaluated in computers.
Before they even touch a piece of wood or steel, they know what the
ride is going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Topping all the rides this year will be Cedar Point's Millennium
Force in Sandusky, overlooking Lake Erie. The roller coaster's
first hill towers 310 feet, or five feet higher than the Statue of
Liberty. It is the first coaster to break the 300-foot barrier and
reach speeds of 92 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''This may be one where people have to work up the courage to
ride it,'' said park spokeswoman Janice Lifke, ''and that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, theme parks with Six Flags, which has a park in
Jackson, N.J., are opening 21 coasters this year. About $40 million
will be spent on four new coasters at Six Flags Ohio near
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's King Island outside Cincinnati is debuting Son of
Beast -- the tallest, fastest wooden roller coaster. It is also the
only looping wooden coaster in America.
</P>
<P>
   Even Walt Disney World, with its traditionally tame rides, has
joined in the coaster wars with the Rock'n'Roller Coaster at Disney
MGM Studios. The ride launches riders from 0 to 57 mph in 2.8
seconds and spins upside down three times.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes to roller coasters, bigger, taller, faster are
words people like to hear,'' said Robert Coker, creator of
ThrillRide.com, an Internet site for roller coaster addicts.

<HEADLINE> Judge Upholds Miami Leaders Firing  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A judge on Tuesday upheld the mayor's firing of the
city manager, part of a City Hall shakeup that followed the federal
raid to remove Elian Gonzalez from the home of his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Steve Levine's ruling dissolved a court order
issued last week that said Donald Warshaw could temporarily keep
his job. Mayor Joe Carollo, not waiting for the ruling, had already
named Warshaw's successor.
</P>
<P>
   With the ruling, Warshaw was officially out of a job. Carlos
Gimenez was sworn in immediately as Miami's new city manager
</P>
<P>
   Levine ruled there was insufficient evidence to back up
Warshaw's claim to hold onto office.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo booted Warshaw just days after former Police Chief
William O'Brien failed to inform the mayor in advance of the armed
federal raid April 22 removing the 6-year-old Cuban boy from his
Miami relatives' home.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo demanded Warshaw fire O'Brien, but Warshaw refused and
instead praised O'Brien's involvement with the federal government
raid, infuriating the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Under the city charter, the city manager has the power to hire
and fire the police chief without consulting the mayor. The mayor
cannot fire the police chief, but can fire the city manager.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of April, Carollo fired Warshaw, and O'Brien
resigned. Warshaw on May 1 went ahead and appointed a new police
chief, Raul Martinez, a 24-year veteran of the force who had been
serving as an assistant city manager.
</P>
<P>
   Gimenez, 46, has served as a fire chief since 1991. His
appointment prompted a kind word Tuesday from his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a member of my own staff, a quality guy,'' Warshaw said.
''I have every reason to believe that the city will move forward in
the proper way.''

<HEADLINE> Primaries in Nebraska, West Virginia  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN O'HANLON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska Attorney General Don Stenberg took
the first step Tuesday toward reclaiming Sen. Bob Kerrey's seat for
the Republicans, easily defeating the secretary of state and two
other candidates in the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   With 29 percent of precincts reporting, Stenberg had 28,770
votes, or 52 percent, far more than Secretary of State Scott
Moore's 13,043 votes, or 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stenberg will take on popular former Gov. Ben Nelson, who left
office in 1999 after two terms. Nelson easily beat a homeless man
who was his only opponent in the Democratic primary for Kerrey's
seat.
</P>
<P>
   In other elections Tuesday, former University of Nebraska
football coach Tom Osborne routed his two opponents in a GOP
congressional primary. Osborne is adored in football-crazy
Nebraska, though the struggling farm economy and other issues have
dominated his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the same way he prepared for every football game -- taking
nothing for granted,'' said Bruce Rieker, Osborne's campaign
manager.
</P>
<P>
   There were presidential primaries in Nebraska and West Virginia,
but both were essentially meaningless since George W. Bush and Al
Gore have sealed their parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia Gov. Cecil Underwood, who was elected to his first
term as governor in 1956 and to his second term in 1996, easily won
the GOP nomination for his third term Tuesday. At 77, Underwood is
the nation's oldest governor. He is also the only Republican in a
statewide office in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The more dramatic West Virginia race was for the House seat
being left by nine-term Rep. Bob Wise, who was leading in the
Democratic primary to challenge Underwood.
</P>
<P>
   Four Democrats were vying for Wise's seat, including 85-year-old
Secretary of State Ken Hechler, who has already spent 18 years in
Congress, from 1959 through 1977. Hechler and two other Democrats
were well behind lawyer Jim Humphreys, who spent $3 million of his
own money.
</P>
<P>
   Hechler spent about $300,000 of his own money and said anything
over $1 million in a primary is ''overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   With 27 percent of precincts reporting, Humphreys had 9,559
votes, or 38 percent, while state Sen. Martha Yeager Walker had
8,898 votes, or 35 percent, Hechler was in third with 5,687 votes,
23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins will be heavily favored in deeply Democratic West
Virginia to beat Republican Shelley Moore Capito this fall. Capito,
a member of the state House of Delegates, is the daughter of former
three-term Gov. Arch Moore Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, the only Democrat in Nebraska's congressional
delegation, decided not to run for a third term and will instead
become president of New School University in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Stenberg recently defended Nebraska's ban on so-called partial
birth abortions before the Supreme Court. He beat Moore despite the
secretary of state's edge in fund raising this year. Moore had
collected $224,000 to Stenberg's $144,000.
</P>
<P>
   After coaching Nebraska for 25 years and leading the Cornhuskers
to three national championships in the 1990s, Osborne is running
for the House seat held for five terms by Republican Bill Barrett,
who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Osborne connected with voters without even
trying. Despite his self-imposed limit on campaign contributions
over $300 and his refusal to accept money from political action
committees, Osborne had raised $112,285 by mid-April. About half
was unsolicited.
</P>
<P>
   With 19 percent of precincts reporting, Osborne had 9,851 votes
-- 68 percent. Longtime state GOP leader John Gale followed with
2,978 votes, or 20 percent, and state Board of Education member
Kathy Wilmot had 1,738 votes -- 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne advanced to a November election against Democrat Rollie
Reynolds, a real estate investor.

<HEADLINE> Koreas Continue To Discuss Summit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The two Koreas have agreed to continue
discussion on the agenda and other details of a summit of their
leaders through documents instead of meetings, South Korean
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The change is meant for effectiveness,'' said Kim Hyon-doo, a
spokesman for the Unification Ministry. ''We exchanged the first
documents yesterday (Tuesday), which proved effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The change came after the two sides failed to iron out
differences over the agenda and other details of the summit at a
fourth round of talks on their border on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea then proposed that the next and fifth round of
preparatory talks be held the next day at the border village of
Panmunjom but North Korea said no.
</P>
<P>
   Kim stressed that the change in the format of discussion does
not mean that the two sides have insurmountable problems. He said
that if differences are successfully resolved, the two sides then
will call a formal meeting to sign an accord.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials earlier said two issues remained
unresolved: the expression of the language of the agenda and the
size of the South Korean press corp.
</P>
<P>
   The June 12-14 summit in the North's capital of Pyongyang would
be the first ever between the Koreas which were divided into the
communist North and the pro-Western South in 1945. They fought a
three-year war in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea proposed a four-point agenda calling for economic
cooperation, peace measures, the reunion of separated family
members and the establishment of a permanent channel of government
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials said privately they would agree to a
broadly worded North Korean proposal which stresses peace and
unification.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea proposed sending an 80-member press corps but North
Korea asked the number to be cut by half, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Unification Minister Park Jae-kyu said at a breakfast
meeting with civilian leaders Wednesday that at the June summit,
South Korea will ask North Korean leader Kim Jong Il to visit Seoul
by year's end.

<HEADLINE> Belfour-Roy Matchup Adds Intrigue  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- If you were playing a computer hockey game that
generated players according to their statistics over the last 15
years, Colorado's Patrick Roy would be a great choice as your
goalie.
</P>
<P>
   But if your software only had stats from the last three years,
Dallas' Ed Belfour would be a better choice.
</P>
<P>
   The real Belfour and Roy will soon go head-to-head in the
Western Conference finals for the second straight season. The
best-of-seven series begins with games at Dallas on Saturday night
and Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining Dallas in 1997-98, Belfour has led the Stars to
the conference finals each season. His 34 playoff wins and seven
shutouts are the most in that span.
</P>
<P>
   Roy has 22 wins and two shutouts in the last three postseasons.
However, his 118 career playoff victories are the most by a goalie
in NHL history. His name appears on the Stanley Cup in three
places, two more than Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour and Roy are both 8-2 this postseason. Although Belfour
has three shutouts to Roy's one, the Colorado goalie has a slight
edge in goals-against average (1.67 to 1.80) and save percentage
(.935 to .927).
</P>
<P>
   ''Eddie's been phenomenal,'' teammate Scott Thornton said.
''Every game, he's been there for us. But Patrick is no slouch.
He's a warrior, especially in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Belfour said he was as good as Roy if not
better. The Avalanche are 2-0-1 against the Stars since then with
Roy allowing just four goals in those three games.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pressure is on him, not me,'' Roy said. ''I'm not the one
who made the comment. He thinks he's better than me? That's fine
with me. I don't feel I need to compare myself to anybody. I know
where I stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour is taking a more humble approach to the duel.

   ''I always like the challenge of playing against Patrick,'' he
said. ''The games are always competitive. I don't expect anything
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour is having his best season yet in Dallas. He was the one
who kept the Stars winning through a rash of injuries and other
lineup problems. He finished with the NHL's highest save percentage
and was third in goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing he's had trouble snagging is respect.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour's reputation for having a flaky personality was thought
to have been shattered by his poise in leading Dallas to the Cup
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Not being invited to the All-Star game was an indication what
others thought of him. A March arrest for violent behavior at a
posh Dallas hotel didn't help his case, and was probably a big
reason why he wasn't among the three finalists for the Vezina
Trophy as the league's top goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Belfour continues stopping pucks the way he's been doing
lately, he'd be among the favorites to win the Conn Smythe Trophy
as playoff MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eddie knows what's up in the next series,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ''He's going to have to be a big, big player for us
to win.''

McCain Gives Endorsement To Bush
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- John McCain endorsed George W. Bush for president today
but compared his action to taking a dose of medicine and said he didn't want to
be Bush's running mate. Behind their smiles, the strains from a bitter
Republican primary fight were still apparent. Even as McCain said he looked
forward to ''enthusiastically campaigning'' for the presumptive GOP nominee, the
vanquished rival had to be prompted before using the word ''endorse.''

Law Catches Up With Ex-Louisiana Gov.

<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Former Gov. Edwin Edwards, who was known for
nod-and-a-wink politics but always evaded prosecutors, was convicted for the
first time today, on charges he extorted hundreds of thousands of dollars from
businessmen applying for riverboat casino licenses. The former four-term
Democratic governor was found guilty along with his son Stephen of fraud and
racketeering. The scheme took place during Edwards' final term and after he left
office in 1996, when he still wielded considerable influence in Louisiana
politics.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an extraordinary assembly of Republican and Democratic
administrations spanning three decades, former Presidents Ford and Carter closed
ranks today with President Clinton to push for a China trade deal that appears
increasingly likely to pass. ''We want the voice of this meeting to echo across
the country and to embrace the Congress,'' Clinton told more than 200 VIPs in
the chandeliered East Room. ''I wish it weren't a fight, but it is.'' Two weeks
before the House opens debate on granting China permanent trade benefits,
supporters of the proposal are optimistic about winning.

<HEADLINE> Wild Turkey Warehouse Burns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCEBURG, Ky. (AP) -- Flames shot 50 feet into the air
Tuesday as a blaze consumed a seven-story warehouse full of Wild
Turkey bourbon and reduced it to rubble, threatening the city's
water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Burning bourbon mixed with water from fire hoses flowed down a
gully beside the warehouse into the Kentucky River. A water
treatment plant was shut down after a large amount of bourbon
entered the river near the intake for the city's water supply.
</P>
<P>
   The burning bourbon also set fire to woods behind the water
treatment plant, sheriff's officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the afternoon fire at the Wild Turkey Distillery
was not known, said Gregg Snyder, the director of operations at the
plant. ''We're investigating everything at this point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hazlett, city public works director, said three employees
at the treatment plantheard an explosion Tuesday and went outside
to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ''One end of the warehouse had been blown out and part of one
side. They said in about three minutes it all collapsed,'' Hazlett
said.
</P>
<P>
   The warehouse was one of 12 at the plant. Each warehouse
contains between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels filled with about 53
gallons of bourbon, Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Two firefighters were taken to a hospital with heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The Wild Turkey plant is on a hill overlooking the Kentucky
River about 30 miles west of Lexington.

<HEADLINE> Even Weather Goes Against Tigers  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- There is some comfortable clutter on top of Phil
Garner's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stuff being perused by the Detroit Tigers' manager is
a video called ''Spring Free Agents'' and a soft cover book titled
''2000 Player Profiles.'' An open laptop computer sits on a work
table behind Garner's swivel chair.
</P>
<P>
   Does this sound like the Tigers are looking for help?
</P>
<P>
   Garner and Randy Smith, the club's general manager, talk every
day. Despite the worst record in the major leagues, however, the
only moves the Tigers have made this week was recalling reliever
Masao Kida from Triple-A Toledo on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers (9-22) were on their way to a win Tuesday, leading
3-0 in the third inning against Kansas City when the game was
rained out. If they should drop to 9-23, they would match the worst
32-game start in club history. The Tigers have scored two runs on
18 hits in their last 29 innings that counted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anybody saw this coming,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers also rank last in a number of offensive categories,
including batting average (.247), runs (113) and total bases (418).
The Tigers were held to two runs or less in 16 of their first 31
games.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the man who assembled this team, has come under
increasing fire. And the strain is beginning to show.
</P>
<P>
   In his worst nightmare, Smith never imagined something like this
could happen. Not to a lineup that included proven hitters like
Juan Gonzalez, Dean Palmer, Tony Clark and Bobby Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people would have said our Achilles' heel would be our
starting pitching, and I would have agreed with that,'' Smith said.
''But I never thought we'd have trouble swinging the bat. I would
never have said we wouldn't be scoring runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, the two-time AL MVP, hit .326 with 128 RBIs and 39
homers for the Texas Rangers last season. With the Tigers, however,
he is off to a start as bad as the team's.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has been nursing a tight hamstring in his right leg all
season. He arrived at Comerica Park on Tuesday sporting a .220
average with eight RBIs and four homers.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who hit .263 with 100 RBIs and 38 homers in 1999, has a
.244 average with 13 RBIs and five homers. Clark, hitting .169, has
been dropped to seventh in the batting order. Higginson is hitting
.248.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if it's possible to feel worse,'' Smith said.
''We're disappointed. It's the same old thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet somehow things do seem to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, for example, even the weather seemed to be going
against the hard-luck Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not worried about that,'' Garner said. ''The good news
is we were seeing some good stuff from out hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers took a 2-0 lead in the first on RBIs by Juan
Encarnacion and Bobby Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   Royals right-hander Mac Suzuki, making his first start since
being banished to the bullpen April 19, gave up an RBI single to
Luis Polonia in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, held to just four hits in an 11-inning loss Monday
night, had four hits in the first inning. When play was halted by
lightning, severe thunderstorms and hail at 7:56 p.m. EDT, the
Tigers had runners at first and third with a 1-0 count on Tony
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rainout, none of the statistics count. That came
as an especially bitter pill for Detroit starter Dave Mlicki, who
was looking for his first win of the season in his seventh start.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's frustrating for everybody,'' Mlicki said. ''I had
everything, unfortunately,'' Mlicki said. ''It was one of those
days you don't have very often. I felt like I could throw just
about anything I wanted and it would be a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   After a wait of 1 hour, 40 minutes, umpires called the game. No
immediate makeup date was announced, and Detroit said it would not
be played this week.

<HEADLINE> Primaries in Nebraska, W. Virginia  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN O'HANLON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska Attorney General Don Stenberg took
the first step Tuesday toward reclaiming Sen. Bob Kerrey's seat for
the Republicans, easily defeating the secretary of state and two
other candidates in the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   With 38 percent of precincts reporting, Stenberg had 43,168
votes, or 50 percent, far more than Secretary of State Scott
Moore's 20,737 votes, or 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stenberg will take on popular former Gov. Ben Nelson, who left
office in 1999 after two terms. Nelson easily beat a homeless man
who was his only opponent in the Democratic primary for Kerrey's
seat.
</P>
<P>
   In other elections Tuesday, former University of Nebraska
football coach Tom Osborne routed his two opponents in a GOP
congressional primary. Osborne is adored in football-crazy
Nebraska, though issues such as the struggling farm economy and
bringing technology to rural areas dominated his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question I had a name recognition advantage, but as
time went on people started to focus on the issues and not who was
a football coach and who wasn't,'' Osborne told 150 supporters at
an election night party on a private ranch.
</P>
<P>
   There were presidential primaries in Nebraska and West Virginia,
but both were essentially meaningless since George W. Bush and Al
Gore have sealed their parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia Gov. Cecil Underwood, who was elected to his first
term as governor in 1956 and to his second term in 1996, easily won
the GOP nomination for a third term Tuesday. At 77, Underwood is
the nation's oldest governor. He is also the only Republican in a
statewide office in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The more dramatic West Virginia race was for the House seat
being left by nine-term Rep. Bob Wise, who won the Democratic
primary to challenge Underwood.
</P>
<P>
   Four Democrats were vying for Wise's seat, including 85-year-old
Secretary of State Ken Hechler, who has already spent 18 years in
Congress, from 1959 through 1977. Hechler and two other Democrats
were well behind lawyer Jim Humphreys, who spent $3 million of his
own money.
</P>
<P>
   Hechler spent about $300,000 of his own money and said anything
over $1 million in a primary is ''overkill.'' He ran a TV ad Monday
urging voters to cast their ballot for anyone but Humphreys.
</P>
<P>
   With 39 percent of precincts reporting, Humphreys had 13,260
votes, or 40 percent, while state Sen. Martha Yeager Walker had
10,267 votes, or 31 percent. Hechler was in third with 7,677 votes,
23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins will be heavily favored in deeply Democratic West
Virginia to beat Republican Shelley Moore Capito this fall. Capito,
a member of the state House of Delegates, is the daughter of former
three-term Gov. Arch Moore Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, the only Democrat in Nebraska's congressional
delegation, decided not to run for a third term and will instead
become president of New School University in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Stenberg recently defended Nebraska's ban on so-called partial
birth abortions before the Supreme Court. He beat Moore despite the
secretary of state's edge in fund raising this year. Moore had
collected $224,000 to Stenberg's $144,000.
</P>
<P>
   After coaching Nebraska for 25 years and leading the Cornhuskers
to three national championships in the 1990s, Osborne, 63, is
running for the House seat held for five terms by Republican Bill
Barrett, who is retiring. Osborne will face Democrat Rollie
Reynolds, a real estate investor, in November.
</P>
<P>
   With less than one-third of precincts reporting, Osborne had
17,457 votes -- 69 percent. Longtime state GOP leader John Gale
followed with 4,938 votes, or 19 percent, and state Board of
Education member Kathy Wilmot had 3,061 votes -- 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his self-imposed limit on campaign contributions over
$300 and his refusal to accept money from political action
committees, Osborne had raised $112,285 by mid-April. About half
was unsolicited.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Primeau Injured in Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers center Keith Primeau was
carried off the ice on a stretcher after being run over by
Pittsburgh's Bob Boughner in the first minute of Tuesday night's
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after a faceoff at midice, Boughner skated across the
neutral zone from along the right wing boards and leveled Primeau,
who was skating up ice with his head down.
</P>
<P>
   Primeau lay motionless for several minutes and appeared to be
momentarily unconscious before being removed on the stretcher. He
was taken to UPMC Presbyterian University Hospital for
precautionary reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The team did not update his condition after the game, but
several players said they were told X-rays were negative. Primeau
was to remain overnight for observation.
</P>
<P>
   The collision occurred with 48 seconds gone and followed an
incident in Game 5 Sunday at Philadelphia in which Flyers
defenseman Luke Richardson teed up a slap shot and hit Boughner
directly in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was not suspended by the NHL despite the Penguins'
argument that Richardson intentionally shot the puck at Boughner.
On Monday, Boughner promised to get back at Richardson, even if it
didn't occur during Game 6 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are ways to come back, and ways to take care of what
needs to be taken care of,'' Boughner said. ''It may not be the
next game ... it may be next year.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Boughner said, ''He had his head down going up
the middle and he was looking for a pass. We wanted to come out and
hit them hard ... but you hate to see anybody on a stretcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Primeau scored the game-winning goal in the fifth overtime of
the Flyers' 2-1 victory over Pittsburgh on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the Flyers were determined not to let the
Primeau incident distract them from winning the game. The Flyers
won 2-1 to advance to the Eastern Conference finals against New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want to get caught up in any of that,'' Richardson
said. ''We said to ourselves that the best thing we could do was
play hard and win the game. Everybody did a good job of refocusing
and keeping our minds on what we had to do.''

<HEADLINE> Braves 10, Marlins 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Javy Lopez hit a grand slam to cap Atlanta's
five-run first inning as the Braves snapped a three-game losing
streak with a 10-5 win over the Florida Marlins on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   John Burkett (1-2), who played for the Marlins in 1995-96,
allowed two runs and six hits in six innings for his first win with
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who had lost four of five since a franchise-record
15-game winning streak ended last Wednesday in Los Angeles, tied
their season high in runs. They beat Philadelphia 10-1 on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Penny (3-4) allowed six runs and three hits in 2 1-3 wild
innings. He walked seven, hit two batters, threw a wild pitch and
balked once.
</P>
<P>
   Penny, who had worked at least six innings in each of his
previous six starts, had control problems from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the first, he hit Andruw Jones and walked
Chipper Jones and Andres Galarraga, loading the bases. Penny then
hit Brian Jordan, allowing Andruw Jones to score.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, who went 3-for-4, followed with his third career grand
slam, an opposite-field shot to right, to make it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins scored a run in the bottom of the first on Mark
Kotsay's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves chased Penny in the third. Atlanta loaded the bases
when Lopez walked, Bobby Bonilla singled and Rafael Furcal walked.
With one out, Penny walked Quilvio Veras to make it 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves added single runs in the fifth and sixth before
scoring twice in the seventh. A run-scoring double by Galarraga was
the big hit, giving him 1,199 RBIs in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lowell hit a solo homer off Kerry Ligtenberg in the eighth
inning, and Mark Smith had a two-run shot off Bruce Chen in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Braves closer John Rocker has allowed five runs, seven hits
and three walks in his past three games. ... The Marlins have six
wins against the NL East. Last year, they didn't reach that total
until June 27. ... Mark Kotsay's third-inning RBI triple was the
19th triple of his career, tying Kurt Abbott for the Marlins'
record.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Vladimir Guerrero led off the ninth inning with
a homer and Terry Jones' RBI infield single capped a three-run
rally as the Montreal Expos beat the Philadelphia Phillies 3-2 on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 2-0, Guerrero started the comeback against Wayne Gomes
(1-3) with his 10th homer. Lee Stevens walked and was forced at
second on Chris Widger's grounder to third.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mordecai doubled to the left-field corner to score Widger
from first with the tying run. Mordecai advanced to third on
Orlando Cabrera's grounder to second and then scored the winning
run when Jones beat out a high chopper to second baseman Mickey
Morandini.
</P>
<P>
   Gomes' blown save spoiled a solid effort by Phillies starter
Chris Brock, who allowed just four hits in seven scoreless innings.
It was Gomes' second blown save in seven chances.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kline (1-0) pitched a perfect ninth for his first win.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant hit his fifth homer off Hideki Irabu in the sixth
inning, and Doug Glanville had an RBI single in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu set down the first seven Phillies he faced before Desi
Relaford singled to left with one out in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Relaford advanced to second on Brock's sacrifice and scored when
Glanville ground a single up the middle, just past the reach of
second baseman Jose Vidro's diving attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu allowed four hits and two runs in six innings to reduce
his ERA from 7.67 to 6.88. He struck out five.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brock had a career-high 11 strikeouts in seven innings in
his last start against Montreal, a 4-0 loss on April 14 at Veterans
Stadium. ... Only 8,845 were on hand for the game, the smallest
crowd at Olympic Stadium this season. ... Scott Rolen went 0-for-3,
ending a his multi-hit-game streak at five. ... Philadelphia
starters have a 1.43 ERA over their last six games, going at least
seven innings each time out. ... The Expos placed reliever Scott
Strickland on the 15-day DL -- retroactive to May 3 -- with
tendinitis in his right shoulder. ... Cabrera made two fine diving
plays at shortstop to field grounders to his right, throwing out
Rolen for the first out of the second and Gant to end the third.

   Pete Schourek (1-3) allowed six runs -- three earned -- on seven
hits, striking out four and walking two in 6 1-3 innings. He also
had a wild pitch in Chicago's three-run sixth and a throwing error
as the White Sox scored three unearned runs in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago led 3-0 when Herbert Perry singled to lead off the
seventh, and Josh Paul tried to bunt him to second. Schourek
fielded the ball in front of the mound and threw the ball to first,
but second baseman Jose Offerman was late in covering and ball went
into right field.
</P>
<P>
   After Ray Durham sacrificed the runners to second and third,
Craig Wilson grounded one past third baseman Wilton Veras for
another error. Wilson and Paul combined for a double-steal, and
Frank Thomas was intentionally walked to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Magglio Ordonez hit a two-run single to make it 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin, who had been 0-2 with a 16.36 ERA in Fenway Park in his
career, has had a history of bad first halves. In the previous two
seasons, he was 7-12 with a 6.88 ERA over the first half and 18-7
with a 3.61 ERA after the break.
</P>
<P>
   Durham singled to lead off the sixth, took second on Wilson's
sacrifice bunt and, after Thomas was intentionally walked, scored
on Paul Konerko's single to make it 1-0. Schourek uncorked a wild
pitch to put runners on second and third, then Carlos Lee singled
to give Chicago a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Paul and Wilson each picked up their first stolen base of
the season on the double-steal in the seventh. Paul's was the first
of his career. ... The Red Sox have thrown out just 6 of 30
baserunners attempting to steal. ... Chicago LHP Jim Parque served
the final game of his three-game suspension for his role in an
on-field brawl April 22 against Detroit. The other six White Sox
suspended already have completed serving their penalties. ... The
White Sox lost seven of eight during the suspensions after starting
the season 17-7.

<HEADLINE> Flyers 2, Penguins 1  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins historically can't win
in Philadelphia. The Flyers are in the Eastern Conference finals
largely because the Penguins now can't beat them in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Recchi and John LeClair set up each other for goals and the
Flyers, winning for the third time in a week in a rink where they
once rarely won, eliminated the Penguins 2-1 Tuesday night in the
Eastern Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers went 3-0 in Pittsburgh -- they are 4-1 on the road in
the playoffs -- to win the best-of-seven series 4-2. They are the
13th NHL team to win a series after falling behind 2-0 at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers had won only two of their previous 15 games in
Pittsburgh before the series turned dramatically as Philadelphia
won there twice in overtime in three nights, including Thursday's
suspenseful 2-1, five-overtime decision.
</P>
<P>
   With rookie defenseman Andy Delmore scoring five goals -- as many
as Penguins star Jaromir Jagr -- and Recchi adding two goals and
five assists in the final two games, the Flyers move on to the
conference finals against Atlantic Division rival New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins, rescued from bankruptcy by retired star Mario
Lemieux a day before training camp began, were eliminated in Game 6
of the second round for the second consecutive season despite
opening the series with their first two victories at Philadelphia
in six years.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers' toughness and size -- and rookie goalie Brian
Boucher's unflappable play -- and the two overtimes wore down the
Penguins' largely European lineup after the Penguins outscored the
Flyers 6-1 in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins, who had never before lost every home game in a
playoff series lasting as many as six games, got a boost Tuesday
from the return of Jagr, who was limited by a thigh injury to a
couple of shifts in Sunday's 6-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   But Jagr, held scoreless in the final three games after scoring
five goals in the first three, couldn't find the net on a couple of
good, early scoring chances. The Flyers, who lost center Keith
Primeau following a midice collision with Penguins defenseman Bob
Boughner in the opening minute, also got a big lift by killing off
a pair of early Penguins power plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins were 0-for-3 on the power play Tuesday, 0-for-12
while losing the final four games and 2-for-27 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Flyers got the critical first goal on a power
play with the Penguins' Jiri Slegr off for interfering with Rick
Tocchet.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Desjardins' shot deflected off LeClair's skate in front of
the net to Recchi, who steered it by goalie Ron Tugnutt at 11:04 of
the first. It was Recchi's second goal in two games after he was
held to one goal in the first nine playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   The same Flyers line made it 2-0 in the first minute of the
second period as Recchi, the NHL's regular season assist leader,
grabbed a rebound of Desjardins' shot, faked a wraparound, then
found an open LeClair at the side of the net for his sixth goal.
</P>
<P>
   Desjardins, Delmore and Dan McGillis, the Flyers' top three
defensemen, have a combined eight goals and 13 assists in 11
playoff games. Desjardins was particularly effective late in the
series after being on the ice for seven of the Penguins' first
eight goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers made the 2-0 lead stand up until Penguins forward
Rene Corbet, a late-season pickup who hadn't scored in 15 games,
scored at 10:46 of the third after Rob Brown grabbed a loose puck
in the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher withstood a flurry of Penguins scoring chances down the
stretch and finished with 27 saves. Boucher turned aside 113 of the
Penguins' final 118 shots in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Primeau was carried off the ice on a stretcher after being run
over by Boughner. Before the game, Boughner had promised
retaliation for being slammed in the chest by a Luke Richardson
slap shot in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after a faceoff, Boughner skated across the neutral zone
from along the right wing boards and leveled Primeau, who was
skating up ice with his head down. Primeau lay motionless for
several minutes before being taken to UPMC Presbyterian University
Hospital for precautionary reasons.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Vote Needed On Kosovo Troops  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Appropriations Committee voted
overwhelmingly Tuesday to require congressional approval for U.S.
peacekeepers to remain in Kosovo beyond July 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-3 vote reflected widespread concern among lawmakers about
an open-ended deployment of American soldiers, who make up 5,900 of
the 37,000 NATO-led peacekeepers in the breakaway Yugoslav
province. Sporadic ethnic violence lingers there, nearly a year
after the end of NATO's 78-day air war against the forces of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came as the appropriations panel approved roughly $8
billion for this year to keep American troops in Kosovo, help
Colombia's government battle drug traffickers, and assist victims
of last autumn's Hurricane Floyd and other domestic natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   White House budget chief Jack Lew criticized the committee for
coupling the money with other items the Clinton administration
opposes, including environmental provisions and limits on the
Justice Department's ability to pursue its lawsuit against the
tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The provision threatening the withdrawal of troops from Kosovo
was sponsored by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., one of Congress' most
ardent protectors of its constitutional powers, and Senate Armed
Service Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd argued that lawmakers had never approved or even debated
whether U.S. ground troops should be stationed in the region. His
language would cut off funds for U.S. troops in Kosovo after July
1, 2001, without Congress' consent.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the committee that controls the only real, raw, basic,
fundamental power in this government. That is the money,'' Byrd
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Tuesday night in Denver, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright called the efforts by Congress to block money
for peacekeeping in Kosovo ''wrongheaded.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The exit strategy for our troops out of Kosovo is to provide
money for stability and the creation of institutions there,''
Albright told the World Trade Center, a business organization.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., one of the three Democrats who
voted against Byrd, said Milosevic would benefit if the provision
becomes law because ''all the butcher has to do is wait until the
U.S. withdraws.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the provision was unclear because the House narrowly
rejected a similar amendment in March and the Clinton
administration opposes it. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said that White House National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger ''is very upset about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's language would also withhold 25 percent of the money for
Kosovo in the bill for this year unless President Clinton certifies
that European countries are living up to their promises to provide
reconstruction money for the province. He would have until July 15
of this year to provide that certification.
</P>
<P>
   By voice vote, the appropriations panel also adopted another
amendment by Byrd requiring the president to get congressional
approval to spend any money in Colombia beyond the funds provided
in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers of both parties have warned that the United
States risks getting dragged into a bloody civil war in Colombia,
where the government has been battling drug traffickers aided by
leftist guerillas and right-wing militias.
</P>
<P>
   Though the appropriations panel offered few specific details,
some Senate aides estimated that the committee had approved about
$1.2 billion for Colombia and about $1.8 billion for U.S. forces in
Kosovo, a bit less than Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
   That money -- plus other funds for defense, farmers and other
programs -- was divided among three measures financing agriculture,
military construction and foreign aid programs in fiscal 2001,
which starts Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Adding momentum to a top farm issue, the Senate panel voted by
voice to add language to the agriculture bill lifting the embargo
on selling food and drugs to Cuba. A similar provision is in the
House version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lew complained that the spending bills contained language
reducing the administration's ability to limit waste sites produced
by hard-rock mines and removing some land on North Carolina's Outer
Banks from protection as a refuge.
</P>
<P>
   It would also prevent federal agencies from reimbursing the
Justice Department for the legal expenses of the government's
lawsuit against the tobacco industry, which Lew said would in
effect prevent the department from pursuing the legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't seem to me to be designed for a smooth path'' to
getting signed into law by Clinton, Lew said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans planned to boost education spending by $2
billion over this year's levels in a fiscal 2001 spending bill they
planned to unveil on Wednesday, House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., announced.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been determined to be seen as defenders of
schools as education has emerged as a top issue in this year's
presidential and congressional election campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Angels Pitcher Ken Hill Injures Arm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Angels pitcher Ken Hill left Tuesday
night's game against Oakland in the third inning with an apparent
arm injury.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who threw 67 pitches, sustained the injury while throwing
a fastball to Miguel Tejada with one out and a man on first. After
finishing his follow-through, Hill sank to his knees and doubled
over in pain as the Angels training staff went to his aid.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, 34, is 3-3 with a 7.47 ERA in eight starts. The
right-hander was on the disabled list twice last season, once
because of inflammation in his pitching elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels already have starters Jason Dickson and Tim Belcher
on the disabled list. Dickson, who had a strained hip flexor, is
eligible to come off the DL on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Belcher isn't expected to come back until June -- at the
earliest -- because of inflammation in his right elbow.
