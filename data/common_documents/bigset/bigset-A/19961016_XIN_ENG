<HEADLINE> Social Well-Being in US Falling to 25-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The social well-being in the
United States has fallen to its lowest point in almost 25 years,
and the children and young people are suffering the most,
according to an index developed by researchers at Fordham
University of New York City.
</P>
<P>
The report looks at Federal Government statistics on 16 social
problems, comparing each annual measure with the year in which it
was at its best level. It then derives an index figure on a scale
of 0-100, with 100 the best score. The score was 37.5. the
nation's best year, as measured in the report, was 1973, when the
index stood at 77.5.
</P>
<P>
Of the six problems concerning Americans younger than 18,
four-- child abuse, teen-age suicide, drug abuse and the high
school dropout rate -- worsened in 1994, the most recent year
covered by the index.
</P>
<P>
It was the first year that the four issues involving children
and teen-agers have fallen in the index in a single year.
</P>
<P>
"The decline in the social health of children and youth tell us
something about the future shape of our society. It's a warning
sign," said Marc L. Miringoff, director of the institute for
Innovation in Social Policy at the Fordham Graduate Center.
</P>
<P>
Among other concerns that worsened in 1994 was the gap between
rich and poor, which has fallen in the index at a faster rate in
the 1990's than any other problems.

MOSCOW, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Preparation for Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's heart surgery is going as planed,
presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said today.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing in the Kremlin that doctors

The spokesman also said cardiac surgeon Renat Akchurin, who is
to operate on the president, had recently been to Germany with a
group of Russian surgeons to meet their notable German peers.

<HEADLINE> Expert Says AIDS Will Not Spread Rapidly in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A disease-control expert says
that AIDS will not spread rapidly in China, although the number of
HIV carriers has doubled and redoubled in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"China is at a critical point in its AIDS control. But some new
measures will be adopted to slow down the spread of the disease,"
Prof. Dai Zhicheng, vice president of the National AIDS Committee,
said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Since China reported the first AIDS case in 1985, the number of
HIV carriers leaped from 32 in 1988 to 446 in 1990, and to 969 in
1992.
</P>
<P>
The figure is expected to approach 5,000 by the end of this
year; one year ago, the number was 3,341. Experts list the actual
total as between 50,000 to 100,000, believing that many HIV
carriers are not reported.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS is spreading very fast in some neighboring countries of
China, and it is being transmitted through every possible method
in our country," said Dai, director general of the Disease Control
Department under the Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
China will set up a national AIDS control center and improve
nationwide AIDS monitoring networks. Some regulations or laws on
administrating the use of blood are to be published, he said.
</P>
<P>
Government departments in charge of public health, law
enforcement, education and other sectors and community
organizations will launch campaigns to spread AIDS education.
</P>
<P>
"We should let the public gain scientific knowledge about AIDS,
teach them to be careful and not to discriminate against HIV
carriers and AIDS patients," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
A large-scale campaign to promote cultural and ethical progress
among Chinese people, which was recently launched by China's
central government, will help reduce the number of AIDS cases
brought about by unsafe sex and drug use, he said.
</P>
<P>
A national conference on AIDS will be held here tomorrow,
during which government officials and medical experts will discuss
AIDS prevention, control and education.

<HEADLINE> World Food Production Must Increase, Says FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- World food production have to
increase by 75 percent to ensure adequate food supplies because
800 million people in third world countries are chronically
undernourished.
</P>
<P>
Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) representative for
southern and eastern Africa Victoria Sekitoleko made the
remarks here today.
</P>
<P>
She said, the world by 2030 would have to feed an additional
three billion people notwithstanding that at present 200 million
chidren under the age of five in developing countries suffer from
protein or energy deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
Of Africa's 52 countries, 41 are classified as low income food
deficit countries while one out of every four Africans has never
had a full meal.
</P>
<P>
She said, ''world food production will have to increase by
more than 75 percent to ensure adequatge food supplies.''
</P>
<P>
''The problem is compounded by the fact that even where food
stores exist, much of the world's population cannot afford to
purchase them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
''Among the steps that need to be taken include providing
long-term support for the agricultural sector, access to export
and import markets and the reforming of institutional structures,
social services and economic policies,'' said Sekitoleko.
</P>
<P>
She was briefing journalists on the eve of the World Food Day
(on Wednesday) on preparations for the world food summit to be
held in Rome on November 13 to 17.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Makes Progress in Methane Utilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China has made great progress
in methane utilization in the past few years, according to a
high-ranking government official.
</P>
<P>
Hong Fuzeng, Vice-Minister of Agriculture, said during a
national conference on the utilization of methane today, that the
use of the gas has become an important part of the sustainable
development of China's agriculture and rural economy.
</P>
<P>
"It provides not only energy, but also high-quality fertilizers
for farming, and it helps protect the environment," Hong said.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, the country built 200,000 small
methane-generating pits annually for household use. By the end of
1995, China had built 5.7 million small pits which have provided
gas for 25 million farmers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has 540 large pits, and 35,000 for urban
sewage disposal.
</P>
<P>
Hong admitted that some problems, mostly technical, still exist
in the current development of methane use.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested the central authorities speed up the drafting
of laws and regulations governing methane development.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Reiterates Food Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chinese official
today reiterated that China will rely on itself to solve its food
problem and fight against hunger and malnutrition in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yanxi, vice minister of Agriculture, said this during a
ceremony at a national middle school writing competition to mark
tomorrow's World Food Day and the World Food Summit next month.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China has long paid close attention to
eliminating hunger and malnutrition, and has made great progress
in its agriculture development in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China's output of grain, meat and aquatic products all
took a lead in the world. Meanwhile, the poor population decreased
to the present 65 million from 250 million in 1978.
</P>
<P>
According to an ambitious plan made by China's government, by
the end of 2000, the grain output will reach 490 to 500 million
tons, farmer's incomes will be greatly increased and living
conditions marginally improved. The country also promised to
provide enough food and clothes to the 65 million poor people by
that time.
</P>
<P>
"Our government will spare no effort to work out policies and
measures to fulfill these targets," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are still 800 million people in developing
countries who suffer from malnutrition, and 88 countries still
report a scarcity of food. With the increase of the world
population and the decrease of cultivated land, the pressure on
world food security will be heavier and heavier.

<HEADLINE> Israel Disagrees with Arafat's Call for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel today denounced
Palestinian Authority (PA) leader Yasser Arafat's proposal on
deploying international peacekeepers in the West Bank city of
Hebron in order to solve the stumbling obstacle to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier today after meeting with Jordanian King
Hussein in the West Bank town of Jericho, Arafat blast Israel
for giving security excuses for changing the signed agreement on
its troop pullout from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"If you don't trust the joint patrol units, if you don't
trust your soldiers or our soldiers, why not call for an
international presence with participation of the American army,"
Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
The PA leader dismissed Israel's security concerns as a
"continuing slogan" for refusing to implement the signed
agreement on Hebron pullout.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, where 450 Jewish settlers live among 120,000
Palestinians, is the chief obstacle blocking the progress in the
recent Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
However, David Bar-Ilan, senior adviser to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told reporters that Arafat's
suggestion was "astonishing" and "contradictory" to his own
position on rejecting any change to the signed agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We find it's quite astonishing that Chairman Arafat ... until
 today actually said that these agreements can't be reopened and
can't be discussed, and even the most elementary security
arrangements can't be tightened. There he is opening it up
compeletely to a new suggestion that is both contradictory to
the spirit and to the letter of agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Introducing foreign troops is something ... in total
contradiction to what the agreement was all about," he claimed,
adding, such idea was a "non-starter."
</P>
<P>
Bar-Ilan defended Israel's demand for security changes, citing
its suspicion of Palestinian policemen who exchanged fire with
Israeli soldiers in the recent bloody clashes.
</P>
<P>
He said Israeli settlers could not rely on the Palestinian
police for safeguarding their security after the violence.
</P>
<P>
Since last month's violence, Israeli-Palestinian military
joint patrols in the West Bank have been frozen, and Israel is
demanding the PA punish those soldiers involved in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Palestinians should want to discuss this kind of
security which is a fundamental basis of peace co-existence in
Hebron. Otherwise peace process may be doomed. I think anyone
who wants the peace process to proceed must ask the Israeli
government to be very cautious about this kind of security
arrangements in Hebron," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are conflicting statements on the past week's
negotiations on Hebron issue, with the Israeli side claiming that
an agreement was imminent despite Palestinians' denial of any
progress.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this, Bar-Ilan strongly criticized the
Palestinians for playing the common tactics of always trying to
create a crisis until the very last minute "in order to squeeze
more concessions from Israel."
</P>
<P>
He insisted on saying that "very good progress" had been made
as the two sides had solved "the most difficult issue." He also
foresaw "not much (many) difficulties" for the two sides to settle
the security matters in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Jordanian King Hussein's first visit to Jericho
in nearly three decades, Bar-Ilan said it was part of the Arab
campaign to exert pressure on Israel. However, he expressed the
hope that Israeli-Jordanian relations would not be harmed by the
latest developments.

<HEADLINE> Muster No More Interested in Davis Cup If Facing More Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Austrian tennis star Thomas
Muster said on Tuesday that he would be no more interested in
playing Davis Cup if he is confronted with more fan riot in the
future.
</P>
<P>
"I think that if we continue to support those countries with
bad behavior as they are making up their Davis Cup ties, sooner or
later somebody's going to be injured," the world number three said.
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be me. Because if they continue like this,
I'm not interested playing Davic Cup any more. Because it's
nothing to do with the sport."
</P>
<P>
The Austrian was speaking on the opening day of the 772,000
U.S. dollars Marlboro Tennis Championships here on Tuesday. He is
making his Asian debut at the six-day tournament at the Victoria
Park.
</P>
<P>
Muster walked out of the court in a Davis Cup tie against
Brazil last month in Brazil and was fined 8,000 U.S. dollars by a
Davis Cup panel for the move.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that he would have to pay the fine because "I guess
I have no choice."
</P>
<P>
Muster claimed that some of the Brazilian fans spat, cursed and
threw missiles at him during the match, which forced him to leave
the court, thus handing host Brazil the tie.
</P>
<P>
He declined, however, to target his criticism on the sport's
world governing body ITF.
</P>
<P>
"Of course they can fine me for leaving the court. This is
their decision but it was my decision to leave the court," he said.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the referee of the Davis Cup match as "very weak"
for failing to stop the riot earlier.
</P>
<P>
Muster was cautious as for whether to regain the world's top
spot, saying "Everybody wants to be No.1. But unfortunately,
there's only one spot for number one.
</P>
<P>
"So I'm quite happy with what I did last years. Making a jump
like this at the age of 27, 28, and now being 29, I think, is
quite good for me.
</P>
<P>
"I'll try to be as good as possible as long as I can. That's
only my goal but to be number one, two or three, it's very hard to
say."
</P>
<P>
Muster arrived here Tuesday morning and had today off. But he
played in an exhibition match with world number one Peter Sampras
and local star singers Jacky Cheung and Aln Tam at the
tournament's opening ceremony this evening.
</P>
<P>
Muster is to take on South Africa's Neville Godwin, ranked
104th in the world, on Wednesday evening.

<HEADLINE> New Plan by Food Summit to Reduce World Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) - A new plan to reduce world hunger
is to be produced by the food summit next month which some 200
countries will attend, a senior organizer of the meeting said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"More than 800 million people throughout the world, and
particularly in developing countries, do not have enough food to
meet their basic nutritional needs," said Kay Killingsworth,
secretary-general of the summit being organized by the UN Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
Without action it expects that proportion to remain the same
when the global headcount hits 8.5 billion in 2030, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Rome Declaration and the World Food Summit Plan of Action
which will be produced by the November 13-17 gathering lay the
foundations for diverse paths to a common objective food security.
</P>
<P>
"Food security depends not only on agriculture but also on
policy in many other areas," she added.
</P>
<P>
Each nation must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources
and capacities to achieve its individual goals and co-operate
regionally and internationally in order to organize collective
solutions to global issues of food security.
</P>
<P>
Although food production has increased to match the rise in
global population since 1945, current grain shortages suggest a
future food crisis unless fish stocks are conserved, fertile land
protected and agricultural techniques improved.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 world leaders have been invited to the meeting and
about 100 have agreed to attend, said Ms Killingsworth said.

<HEADLINE> Gun Violence in US Subsiding: Studies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Murders, robberies and
assaults committed with guns dropped faster than violent crimes
over all the last year, according to a new study done by the
Center to Prevent Handgun Violence.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures, the number of murders in 1995 fell
7.4 percent from 1994 while the number of murders committed with a
gun dropped 11.6 percent. The number of robberies in 1995
decreased 6.2 percent from 1994, but the number of robberies
committed with a firearm slid 7.6 percent. And the number of
assaults for 1995 dropped 1.3 percent while the number of assaults
with guns fell by 6.35 percent.
</P>
<P>
This decline in gun violence comes after a decade, from 1985 to
1994, when the number of murders, robberies and assaults in which
a gun was used grew nearly 60 percent while the overall rate of
violent crime increased 42 percent, according to one study, the
Federal bureau of investigaion's annual crime survey.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the abrupt reversal of the decade-long
increase in crime committed with guns to new strategies which
include the Brady Bill which requires a waiting period to buy a
handgun, the ban on assault weapons and innovative tactics by
police forces in many cities to focus on guns.

<P>
PESHAWAR, Pakistan, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Interior
Minister Nasirullah Babar asked northern Afghan warlord Rashid
Dostum to hold talks with the Taliban militia during a meeting
held today in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Babar, who leads a Pakistani delegation to visit different
Afghan cities, arrived in Mazar-i-Sharif controlled by Dostum
after holding talks with the Taliban leadership in Kabul today.
</P>
<P>
According to Afghan sources in the northwestern Pakistani city
of Peshawar, Babar asked Dostum to hold talks with the Taliban to
find a peaceful solution for the current conflict in the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
However, Dostum, who controls seven provinces in northern
Afghanistan and poises a threat toward the Taliban, said there
were too many parties involved in the conflict and only two
parties would not solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
No details were available on the talks held in Kabul between
the Taliban leadership and Babar, the first high-ranking foreign
official visiting Kabul after the Taliban overran the capital.
</P>
<P>
Babar and his delegation will also visit the southern city of
Kandahar, stronghold of the Taliban, to hold talks with the
Taliban's top man Maulvi Umar.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Pakistani President Farooq Leghari, Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto and Chief of Army Staff Jehangir Karamat held an
emergency meeting to discuss the latest development in the
neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have suffered heavy losses during the past few days
when the military commander of the ousted Afghan government, Ahmed
Shah Masood, launched attacks on the Taliban-held territories.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- FAezeh Hashemi of Iranian
Olympic Committee vice-president Tuesay called for a support to
Moslem women from the IOC (International Olympic Committee).
</P>
<P>
"As the progressive trend of Olympism goes on, 500 million
Moslem women are ignored because they maintain the moralities as
stated in their holy religion Islam," Hashemi, daughter of
Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani, told the World Conference
on Woman and Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"This isolation is in contrast to the Olympic movement. There
has been nothing done to help include Moslem ladies during the
past 100 years of IOC activities. You can no longer neglect 500
million Moslem ladies of the world," Hashemi was continued to be
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta this year, shooter Lida Fariman became the first
Iranian woman to take part in an Olympics since the Islamic
revolution 17 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Rain Ruins Hong Kong Tennis Championships Opening Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- On-and-off rains interrupted
the opening-day competitions and the organizers had to postpone
one of the four matches on the day's program as the 1996 Marlboro
Tennis Championships opened at the Victoria Park here today.
</P>
<P>
The upset of fourth-ranked Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the
hands of 61st-ranked Australian Patrick Rafter limelighted the
dull day. Rafter won the match 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other matches, Byron Black from Zimbabwe, ranked
51st in the world, won over Grant Connell of Canada 6-3, 6-4 in a
match that was stopped at least two times.
</P>
<P>
And Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden followed with 6-2, 6-3 victory
over South Africa's Neville Godwin.
</P>
<P>
The day's other match, that between Richey Reneberg and fellow
American Vincent Spadea, had to be postponed to Friday, due to the
rain.
</P>
<P>
American Peter Sampras, the world's number one and overwhelming
title favorite, and his arch rival, third-ranked Thomas Muster of
Austria both had the opening day off.
</P>
<P>
Sampras is bidding to win his second Hong Kong tennis title in
just sixth months, following his win in the Salem Open in April.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old American, who arrived here on Sunday, said he
has been in good shape and was confident to win the championships.
</P>
<P>
Muster, however, threatened here today to do away from the
Davis Cup if he is confronted in the future with more crowd riot.
The former world number one walked out of the court during a Davis
Cup tie against hosts Brazil last month.
</P>
<P>
Although he claimed that some Brazilian fans cursed him and
threw missiles at him during the match, a Davis Cup panel decided
that security at the court was "very good". The panel later handed
down a fine of 8,000 U.S. dollars for Muster's walk-out.
</P>
<P>
"If we continue to support those countries with bad behavior
like this when they're making up Davis Cup ties, sooner or later
somebody is going to be injured," Muster claimed.
</P>
<P>
"But it is not going to be me. Because if they continue like
this, I'm not interested in playing in Davis Cup any more. It's
nothing to do with the sport," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said he would have to pay the fine. "I guess I have no
choice," he admitted.
</P>
<P>
Sampras is to take on Connell while Muster meets Godwin on
Wednesday evening.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Brain Drain Gathers Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (xinhua) -- the brain drain from
South Africa continued to gather momentum in the first half of
this year with twice as many people, mainly the highly-skilled,
left the country compared to those coming to seek work here.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Central Statistical Service (CSS) in
Pretoria today said some 5,627 emigrants left South Africa during
the first half of 1996, while the number of immigrants was 2,509.
</P>
<P>
"The net result of immigration and emigration therefore shows
a loss of 3,118 persons. This picture is slightly better than the
first quarter of 1996 where the number of emigrants, 3,083, was
nearly three times the number of immigrants," the CSS said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The biggest migratory sector by far included professional,
semi-professional and technical people, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Liz Coetser of the CSS said those leaving the country included
engineers, accountants, technologists, educationalists, doctors
and dentists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, managerial staff, clerical personnel and artisans
were also among those who left the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the CSS, the most popular destination for South
African emigrants was the United Kingdom, closely followed by
Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the high crime rate, seeking for higher
salary and better working conditions were among the main reasons
for those skilled professionals who left the country.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela once appealed to those who were
planning to leave, to stay, saying South Africa needed their
skills and experience to build a better life for all people.

<HEADLINE> Immigrants Contribute to Modernization of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign immigrant workers have
greatly contributed to the modernization of the French economy in
the 1960s and 1970s, said a report by the daily Le Monde published
today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted French sociologist Claude-Valentin Marie as
saying that the present policy by the French government to crack
down on illegal employment among immigrants can partially endanger
the functioning of the French economy, if the policy goes to
extremes.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, foreigners only take 10 percent of the jobs in
underground employment, while the rest of them are taken by French
people themselves, according to the report, published one day
before the government is due to discuss a tougher law on fighting
illegal employment.
</P>
<P>
The report said that more than 20 years after France stopped to
receive immigrant workers in 1974, thousands of foreigners are
still coming to France each year to seek jobs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of legal foreign workers in France has
dropped from 100,000 to 200,000 in 1970s to about 10,000 now, with
most of them from other European countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, many jobs are still within reach of illegal immigrants
and illegal workers in France, because many jobs are not desirable
for French workers, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that it is not because of an abundance in quantity of
jobs that people keep employing illegal immigrant workers, but
because the job market needs flexibility and fluidity in employing
workers.
</P>
<P>
The report said that each time the productive system of France
had to react to the shock of restructurings, foreigners, and
notably illegal immigrants, served to absorb the shock to let the
French society make its adjustments in employment at the lowest
social and political costs.
</P>
<P>
It quoted former President Georges Pompidou as saying in 1963
that immigration is "a means to create a certain detente in the
job market and to resist social pressure."
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the 1970s, foreign workers became the
biggest victim of the huge waves of lay-off by heavy industrial
enterprises, where were having a fundamental technological
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
From 1973 to 1988, 500,000 foreign workers, or 40 percent of
their total, were sacked by French enterprises at the cheapest
costs, which was double the rate of lay-offs for French workers in
the period, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that foreign immigrants, driven away from big
enterprises, have since then greatly invested in France's service
industry, including restaurants, laundries, craftsman's shops and
stores.

<HEADLINE> Portillo Warns Germany over Threat to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary
Michael Portillo has warned the Germans that the Eurofighter
program would suffer a significant setback unless all the partners
went ahead with the 40-billion-pound (about 60 billion U.S.
dollars) project.
</P>
<P>
The Eurofighter program is under increasing threat as Germany,
which is determined to meet public spending targets to qualify the
single European currency in 1999, is expected to ask for a much
longer period for delivery of the advanced aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Portillo is putting pressure on his German counterpart Volker
Ruehe to continue backing the important European joint project,
which was launched by Germany, Spain, Italy and Britain in 1985,
according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The British Defense chief has urged the Germans to think about
the long term implications for defense rather than short term
economies in order to reach the European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
He has also expressed the concern that the possible delays
would push up the price of the project, reduce profits and
probably undermine the deal altogether.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Commons earlier today, Portillo said, "I have
made it clear that the British Government is ready to proceed. If
we are to have good export prospects for the aircraft it needs to
be produced without further delay."
</P>
<P>
Any delays would seriously damage the credibility of European
defense co-operation, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Public Urged to Be Alert Against Pylon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Electric
Light and Power Authority has called upon the public to be alert
against pylon looters.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency reports today, the call
came from Yusuf Haji Ali, Assistant General Manager of the
Distribution Lines Sector under the authority.
</P>
<P>
Yusuf said, pylons have been looted repeatedly in the country
in the past 12 years, adding that the looting is now still
prevalent in some areas.
</P>
<P>
He said power cuts repeatedly occurred at hospitals,
factories, resorts and residential houses in Addis Ababa and
other towns in various regions due to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Yusuf said verdicts were passed on looters in Amhara and
Southern People's National Region states ranging from one to five
years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
No legal measure has so far been taken against those who buy
the pylons from the looters, he said. He suggested that legal
actions should also be taken against those who buy the stolen
pylons. enditem

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Reiterates Sanctions on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
today said economic embargo imposed on Burundi three months ago
would not be lifted until the military junta there restores the
constitutional government and all democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa added that the restoration of the constitutional
government and democratic institutions should be followed by an
unconditional dialogue with all factions within and out of
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"I am aware that economically, our country is losing a
substantial income, but we may lose even more if we let the
Burundi's crisis continue," the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing local and foreign journalists at a press
conference held at the State House here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa said the situation in Burundi is still
volatile to an extent of eliminating the possibilities of lifting
the economic sanctions imposed by the Great Lakes region states.
</P>
<P>
According to Mkapa, a delegation of African ministers is
expected in Burundi tomorrow, where they will have discussions
with the military junta led by P. Buyoya, trying to set up a
stage for peace talks between warring parties in the war-torn and
ethnically-divided Central African nation.
</P>
<P>
The president said the move is in line with resolutions of the
Great Lakes leaders summit held in Arusha, Northern Tanzania last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, however, said several issues should be worked out
before the ministerial delegation travels to Burundi in the wake
of reports that the military junta demands economic sanctions be
lifted before it enters into peace talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Great Lakes leaders summit held in Arusha on Saturday
directed warring parties in Burundi to start unconditional peace
talks within a month and decided to send a ministerial committee
to Bujumbura to assess the latest developments since the
imposition of economic sanctions in early August this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial committee comprising foreign ministers from
Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Zaire and Cameroun was assigned to
travel to Bujumbura to ascertain professed commitments for peace
talks between the military junta led by Major Buyoya and the
rebel Hutus in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa told journalists that "we are still convinced
that there is need for the ministers to go to Bujumbura, but we
are worried about their security and reception, we are still
working out on that."
</P>
<P>
"The Main problem in Burundi is lack of democratic rule. Let
us create conditions for democratic and constitutional rule
there. The fighting will end there," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa noted that Great Lakes region leaders are not
harboring any secret agenda against Burundi, but mainly opposed
to the illegal and unconstitutional usurpation of power by the
military regime on the July 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
"what were pressing for is restoration of democracy and
constitutional rule, through an unconditional negotiated
settlement under the Mwanza peace process brokered by Mwalimu
Julius Nyerere," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tanzania's economy, the president said the future will be
bright, provided the current negotiations between the government
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) together with the World
Bank are completed next month as planned.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement between the government and global
financial institutions would pave a way for soft loans and grants
totalling 1.2 billion U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> One Third British Homes Connected to Cable Networks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Over 7 million of British 23
million TV homes are now able to access cable services, said
British Science Minister Ian Taylor here today.
</P>
<P>
"We stand on the threshold of a new era in the development of
digital superhighway services," said Mr Taylor at the opening
ceremony of European Cable Communication' 96.
</P>
<P>
"The coming year will be a defining period for the sector. When
we meet again in a year's time, all the crucial strategic
decisions for the transition to digital services will have been
taken," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the year to date, over 2 million new homes have been
connected by cable, and by the year 2001, 60,000 miles (96,000
kilometers) of cable will be in the ground, he said.
</P>
<P>
The cable industry is now able to offer a wider range of
services than ever before. Programming has the potential
increasingly to appeal to the consumer, while the packaging of
telephony services continues to sustain the development of
competition in the market.
</P>
<P>
"The growth of British cable will create some 25,000 jobs over
the next four years, concentrated in areas where unemployment has
traditionally been prevalent," he added.
</P>
<P>
Almost 1,000 schools have been connected free of charge,
opening up a new world of diverse services to children all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
"Video conferencing, distance learning and interactive
multimedia techniques will become valuable classroom tools," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Using digital technology cable will be able to offer rapid
development of the range and quality o Internet services. The
opportunities are enormous, provided resources are mobilized to
seize them effectively.
</P>
<P>
"Those who are not able to move quickly enough into this new
digital marketplace are likely to find themselves among the
casualties of the revolution," he said.

<HEADLINE> Africa Faces Challenge in Food Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Africa is seeking ways and
means to increase food production in a bid to improve the diet of
its growing population as it has seen per capita food production
drop over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release of the Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO) reaching here today, while food production has
grown faster than population in other parts of the world, Africa
has fallen behind.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural output grew at the rate of about 1.9 percent a
year in Sub-Saharan Africa between 1970 and 1990 while the
region's population growth rate averaged 3 percent, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
According to a list of 82 low-income food-deficit countries
which the FAO considered the "poorest and hungriest" in the
world, half of them are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Unless adequate policy measures are taken, the already
disastrous situation facing many African countries risks reaching
unmanageable dimensions," warned a report to the 19th FAO African
Regional Conference held in Ougadougou earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore it is necessary to increase rapidly food supplies
by at least 90 percent by the year 2010 for the region as a whole
to meet the growing food demand in Africa," said the report.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Tuesday expressed its "serious concern" over the stranded
submarine incident of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) on September 18.
</P>
<P>
A presidential statement passed here after a formal meeting of
the Security Council says that "The Council urges that the Korean
Armistice Agreement should be fully observed and that no action
should be taken that might increase tension or undermine peace and
stability on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council stresses that the Armistice Agreement
shall remain in force until it is replaced by a new peace
mechanism," it says.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council encourage both sides of the Korean
peninsula to settle their outstanding issues by peaceful means
through dialogue, so that peace and security on the peninsula will
be strengthened, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the Security Council, China has
also its stand on the incident. It has made efforts in easing the
tension and helping establish a new peace mechanism on the Korean
peninsula and in promoting the normal contacts between the north
and the south.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said that China encourage a calm and cautious
attitude of the international community which, it says, should
regard the incident of the DPRK submarine as an individual one.
The incident should not be used to intensify the conflicts and
affect any further delay of peace process on the peninsula,
according to the sources.

MOSCOW, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chechen separatist leadership
has denied the reports that its chief of staff Aslan Maskhadov was
nominated as a candidate for Chechen president, according to
reports reaching here tonight.
</P>
<P>
The reports cited the separatists' information chief Movladi
Udugov as saying that "forces of the Chechen resistance

the Chechen republic) as a single team and with a single
candidate, but his name will become known not earlier than in
December."

<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency reported earlier today that the
Chechen separatists had nominated Maskhadov, instead of Chechen
separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, as the single candidate
for the forthcoming presidential elections in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Udugov confirmed that Chechnya's "state defense committee"
decreed the elections for January 1997, adding that the Chechen
parliament is to set an exact date soon.

<P>
ABU DHABI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official
of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said that his country attaches
importance to enhancing agricultural development to uplift
self-sufficiency and achieve domestic food security.
</P>
<P>
Said Muhammad al Raghbani, UAE Minister of Agriculture and

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Journalists of several French
news organs, including AFP, Radio France and France Television,
staged a 24-hour strike today to protest a 30 percent reduction of
tax allowances for journalists by Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
Several trade unions, including Syndicat National des
Journalistes (SNJ), Confederation Francaise et Democratique du
Travail (CFDT), Force Ouvriere, and Confederation Francaise du
Travailleurs Chretiens (CFTC), also staged a rally outside the
parliament to protest the government decision.
</P>
<P>
The parliament, or National Assembly, is discussing the 1997
austerity budget plan presented by Juppe, which has already
aroused protests of employees of the public sector, the defense
industry, doctors, and teachers.
</P>
<P>
A national strike is called by the unions for October 17, when
a big demonstration is expected to be staged by protesters from
around the country in Paris to condemn the austerity plan.
</P>
<P>
Several newspapers in Paris and in provinces are expected to be
absent Wednesday from the newspaper stands, or appear in a largely
reduced volume.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the SNJ and SNJ-Confederation General du
Travail was told on Monday by parliamentarian Jacques-Michel Faure
that Juppe has asked the Ministry of Economy and Finances to work
on a "new mechanism" which will guarantee "a zero growth" of
the tax on journalists, while maintaining the allowance reduction.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot agree with this reduction. There was no discussion
about it. One is not privileged earning 14,000 francs (2,800 U.S.
dollars) a month working crazy hours," said a journalist of
L'Equipe sports daily.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti will visit Egypt Wednesday for talks on efforts to
push forward the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti will brief Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and other
officials on the talks held between Jordan's King Hussein and
Palestinian Authority (PA) leader Yasser Arafat Monday and
today, according to Egypt's news agency MENA.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein, who met Arafat in Amman Monday, visited the West
Bank today for the first time since the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with the PA chairman in the West Bank
town of Jericho, King Hussein said he and Arafat would cooperate
closely from now on to ensure that Israel would keep its promises
 made in the peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
The visit by Jordan's premier to Egypt comes at a time when
the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the long-delayed
redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Hebron
will reportedly resume at Egypt's resort town of Taba Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations were scheduled to resume Monday, but have
been put off twice, first to Tuesday and then to Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said today that the Hebron talks were deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between Israel's previous government and
Palestine, Israeli should have pulled 80 percent of its troops
out of Hebron, with the remaining stationed near the Jewish
settler enclaves.

<P>
BELGRADE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Three buses started from
Sarajevo to Belgrade today, thus linking the two major cities in
the Balkan region by regular transportation.
</P>
<P>
Two Sarajevo Centrotrans buses and one Yugoslav Lasta bus,
which went to Sarajevo from Belgrade Monday, were on a joint
inaugural ride to Belgrade today. Lasta Bus company and
Centrotrans are now running the Belgrade-Sarajevo bus line on a
daily basis.
</P>
<P>
Aboarding the Sarajevo-Belgrade buses, the first over the past
five years, were about 100 Centrotrans and Lasta representatives,
guests and journalists, the Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Vice President of the Muslim-Croat Federation Ejup Ganic said
today in Sarajevo that the bus line from Belgrade to Sarajevo
inaugurated Monday and from Sarajevo to Belgrade today was a
crucial step towards normalization of relations between the two
cities.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia and Bosnia normalized their relations after Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic and President of Bosnia's United
Presidency Alija Izetbegovic signed an agreement in Paris early
this month.
</P>
<P>
Ganic announced that an air line would reopen soon, and he
expressed optimism that the cooperation between Bosnia and
Yugoslavia would continue in the future, as the officials of the
two states agreed at their recent meetings, Tanjug reported from
Sarajevo.

<HEADLINE> Mandates of Lebanon's Government, House Expire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's incumbent government
headed by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri automatically resigns at
midnight today according to the constitution since the mandate of
the current parliament expires the same day.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources in the Beirut Presidential Palace announced
that President Elias Hrawi would ask Hariri's government to carry
on its official function until a new government is formed after
the next parliament is opened on October 22.
</P>
<P>
In the Presidential Palace this morning, Hrawi presided at the
last regular session of the Council of Ministers, the second
cabinet led by the billionaire prime minister since he took
office in October 1992.
</P>
<P>
After the session, the president hosted a party in honor of
the outgoing cabinet members. House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime
Minister Hariri attended.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi awarded medals of the highest degree to Berri and Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the party, the president said, "The cooperation
between the authorities has been the guarantee to consolidate the
process from the monetary fluctuation to the currency stability
and from the crises to the settlements."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that "the country of peace is not overcome by
sectarian and confessional struggles on the national path, and
the (country's) general interest is not overpassed by the
interest of a certain group."
</P>
<P>
Alluding to the accusation of corruption which shadowed the
outgoing government, the president stressed, "You should know
that the national peace and economic and social stability will
never become firm with an aggravation of the administrative
corruption."
</P>
<P>
Answering to the president's speech, House Speaker Nabih Berri
said that the cooperation with the president "is a big honor not
only for myself but also for the nation as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Hariri, on the other hand, underlined that in the past four
years since he took office, "the state has experienced a lot of
problems and confronted a number of crises."
</P>
<P>
"We all have cooperated especially in the recent years by this
ship in the voyage toward the coast of faith," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the party, the prime minister left Beirut for Washington
via Paris. In Washington he is scheduled to have a meeting with
U.S. President Bill Clinton on October 18.
</P>
<P>
From October 16, 1996, the new half-Christian-half-Moslem
parliament will start its four-year term. The unicameral house
was born in the general elections in August and September.
</P>
<P>
Hariri and Berri scored victories in the elections and
became heads of the two biggest blocs in the 128-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
The victories have made them the most favored candidates
respectively for the next premier and house speaker.

<HEADLINE> Peace Dawns Upon Somalia as Warlords Agree on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Guo Ming
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Somali warlords declared here
today to end clan hostilities in the devastated country at the
end of the week-long peace talks mediated by Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is Dawning upon the Horn of Africa country," said a
Kenyan official closely involved in the peace talks which he said
had brought together the two most powerful warlords, Hussein
Aideed and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, together with a handful of others.
</P>
<P>
The faction leaders have agreed on the free movement of people
and the removal of all roadblocks in the divided capital
Mogadishu, according to the ceasefire agreement reached in the
Kenyan capital of Nairobi today.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan officials confirmed that Hussein Aideed, the
34-year-old son of late Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed who
was killed by enemies in Mogadishu last August, had met
face-to-face with Ali Mahdi in round-table talks.
</P>
<P>
"This is unprecendented," said a statement released
here today by the Kenyan government.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks were aimed at opening lines of communication
to enable the warlords to "talk among themselves" and restart the
peace process in the war-torn country, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
For the last six years, Somalia has had no internationally
recognized government with hundreds of thousands of civilian
lives lost during clan fightings.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aideed was elected President of somalia by supporters
following the death of his father, and currently heads a
government which has not received recognition from the
international community, Ali Mahdi and other faction
leaders.
</P>
<P>
And Moi, the Kenyan president who is very influential in
the regional affairs in East Africa, has been deeply involved in
Somalia's peace initiatives. It was him that successfully brought
about a face-to-face meeting in Nairobi between Ali Mahdi and
late Mohamed Farah Aideed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Major points of the ceasefire agreement include:
</P>
<P>
-- Declaring cessation of hostilities;
</P>
<P>
-- Allowing free movement of people in Mogadishu and removing
all roadblocks leading from one region to another;
</P>
<P>
-- facilitating delivery of international humanitarian aid to
the people of Somalia;
</P>
<P>
-- Pledging continued dialogue in Somalia for a peace process
and preserving the unity, sovereignty and the territorial
integrity of Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Lebed Holds Fire at Yeltsin's Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 16 (Xinhua) -- What Alexander Lebed had
promised as a sensational revelation did not come out at the
four-hour closed-door hearing of the State Duma, or lower house of
the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Tuesday's hearing, which was held in almost
unprecedented secrecy, the national security chief said he would
reveal "who, how and for how much Chechnya was sold."
</P>
<P>
But sources close to the Duma said the plain-spoken ex-army
general offered nothing new to Duma deputies on Tuesday and
instead carefully avoided aggravating what has become a bitter
squabble between him and Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, however, held five officials responsible for the fall of
Chechnya's capital of Grozny to Chechen separatists last August.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attributed Lebed's restraint to President Boris
Yeltsin's intervention.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin was
concerned about a confrontation on public political stage among
members of his team.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was said to have ordered Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Lebed and Kulikov to reach a consensus before
attending the parliamentary hearing, which most observers had
expected to turn out a verbal duel between Lebed and Kulikov over
the settlement of the Chechen issue.
</P>
<P>
But the hearing proved rather tame, though.
</P>
<P>
The presidential spokesman said: "As far as I know, the order
has been carried out."
</P>
<P>
Although Lebed might have moderated his tone, he blamed the
fall of Grozny on Doku Zavgayev, head of the Moscow-backed Chechen
government, Konstantin Pulikovsky, acting commander of the Russian
forces in Chechnya, Pavel Golubets, interior ministry coordinator
in Chechnya, and Nikolai Koshan, one of the key members on the
Zavgayev team.
</P>
<P>
Lebed told Duma deputies that his accusation was based on his
own investigation of the events leading up to the fall of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov appeared indifferent to the accusations, the Duma
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister downplayed Lebed's accusations by
saying: "I was not afraid of Lebed's accusations." He said he is
prepared to explain the Chechen situation to the prosecutor
general's office.
</P>
<P>
The row among senior government officials popped up following
the signing of the Khasavyurt peace agreement on August 31, and
Lebed called for parliamentary hearings early this month in that
Kulikov had categorized Lebed's Khasavyurt peace agreement as
"high treason".
</P>
<P>
Under the Khasavyurt agreement, Moscow agreed to pull federal
troops out of the breakaway republic and to put off for five years
the defining of Chechnya's political status.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister argued that Russia's integrity should not
be a subject for bargaining but Lebed, in his turn, adamantly
defended his peace plan, saying it was impossible to solve the
Chechen issue by military means.
</P>
<P>
The two have since been trading accusations as Lebed publicly
demanded the dismissal of Kulikov for his failure to keep Grozny
from falling to the hands of Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
Though Lebed and Kulikov stopped short of heaping up
accusations on each other at Tuesday's hearings, their verbal duel
is expected to turn loose outside the parliamentary confinement
and to continue, as the Izvestia newspaper put it, only "a bit
later".

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Receives Message from Saddam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani received Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
special envoy here Tuesday, Iran's official news agency IRNA
reported today.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that the Iraqi special envoy handed the Iranian
president a message from President Saddam.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Iraqi envoy voiced Iraq's desire for
good neighborly relations with Iran and for expansion of mutual
relations.
</P>
<P>
He also called for cooperation and exchange of views between
the two countries on regional issues.
</P>
<P>
However, the official report did not reveal the content of
the message, or the name of the special envoy.
</P>
<P>
Salah Noori Samarmad, Charge d'Affaires of the Iraqi Embassy
here, also declined to reveal the content of the message when
contacted by Xinhua through telephone.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that he did not know the name of the special
envoy dispatched by President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iraqi special envoy had returned to Baghdad
Tuesday. But he declined to go into detail.
</P>
<P>
According to IRNA, President Rafsanjani underlined the need
for making efforts to solve the issue of war prisoners and to
completely enforce all articles of U.N. Resolution 598 on the
ceasefire between the two warring parties.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani also underscored the importance of good neighborly
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian president still regards Saddam Hussein
as the major threat to the peace and tranquility in the region.
</P>
<P>
He told the German weekly Der Spiegel recently "if they are
given a free hand they will destabilize the region, and they do
still have a lot of capabilities in that regard."
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war from 1980 to 1988. Iran
wants to normalize relations with the former enemy, but there are
some big problems, including the prisoners of war, which block
the way for the improvement of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries have agreed on and maintained a
ceasefire since August 1988, there is no real peace between the
two rivals. During the past years, both sides have reported each
other's ceasefire violations to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In the border areas, there is a "no war and no peace"
state. The two countries each still keep a large number of armed
forces along the borders.
</P>
<P>
They criticized each other for lack of trust and sincerity in
their negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Crimes Threaten Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Crimes on a massive scale,
including smuggling endangered species, ozone-depleting substances
and hazardous wastes, pose a major threat to the environment, said
British Environment Secretary John Gummer today.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide illegal trade in endangered species is thought to
be worth over 5 billion U.S. dollars, second only to the smuggling
of drugs and firearms, Gummer said at the launching of the
seminar, Combating Environmental Crime.
</P>
<P>
The illegal trade of CFCs is one of the newer areas of
international environmental crime, he said.
</P>
<P>
CFCs are believed to be the most valuable commodity smuggled
into Miami, United States, except for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, global environmental problems can only be
solved by international cooperation and action, he said.

<HEADLINE> Procuratorial Work in Prisons Emphasized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Policemen who take advantage of
their positions to engage in unethical activities must be dealt
with severely, top procuratorial officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
Legal supervision of law enforcement in prisons is part of the
work of the procuratorial bodies, Zhang Siqing, procurator-general
of the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP), told a national
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We must resolutely deal with criminal cases involving law
enforcement personnel to safeguard the dignity of state laws,"
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5,214 such cases were investigated between 1988 and
mid-1996, according to Chen Dahao, head of the SPP's section
overseeing prisons.
</P>
<P>
Some policemen have asked for and accepted bribes, and engaged
in other unethical behavior in the process of commuting prison
terms, probations and paroles, while others have neglected their
duties or violated the rights of the offenders, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In one case, Zhu Wenjia, a deputy instructor in a prison in
Changchun, in northeast China, has been sentenced to 12 years in
prison for seeking bribes 29 times and accepting 30,000 yuan
(about 3,610 US dollars) in cash and kind.
</P>
<P>
The procuratorial work in prisons should be perceived at the
height of maintaining social stability, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji on Grain Purchase (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji has
asked local governments to protect farmers' interests by
preparing, as early as possible, sufficient grain purchase funds
and storage facilities for the expected bumper harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier made the call at a meeting held in Dalian, in
northeastern Liaoning Province on October 14, to discuss the grain
issue in parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the meeting concluded that the strengthening of
the agricultural sector, especially the improvement of grain
supply and demand, has been an important factor for the noteworthy
improvement of the country's macro-economy.
</P>
<P>
This year's grain output is expected to reach a record high,
while the country's stock of grain, which has been declining in
the past few years, will also hit a new level, according to the
participants.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Zhu emphasized that grain is a strategic
material for the state, and the grain issue is of great
significance to the economic development and social stability.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier, who is also a Standing Committee Member of
the politburo of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee,
warned neither to overestimate nor underestimate potential
difficulties when a good harvest is to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
He urged localities to guarantee to purchase sufficient grain
in this ample harvest year. And the harvested grain should be
properly purchased and well stored, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Related departments must buy all the grain that farmers want to
sell, and there must not be any refusal or limit in grain
purchase, he pointed out, adding that contracted grain should be
bought at state contract prices and negotiable purchases should be
conducted at negotiable prices.
</P>
<P>
The leader said that when the market prices are lower than the
contract prices, farmers should be paid at the protective prices
according to local government regulations. The gap caused by these
purchases should be subsidized by the grain risk funds jointly set
up by the central and local governments.
</P>
<P>
Situations should not be such that farmers gain less when there
is a bumper harvest, and farmers should never be required to bear
losses, Zhu emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that while the central government is increasing the
special grain stock, all localities should also set up and
increase necessary local grain storage, which is an important
means of guaranteeing local grain supply, strengthening
localities' abilities to fight natural calamities and improving
market regulation, he said.

WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- King Hussein of Jordan returned to the West Bank Tuesday for
the first time since he lost it to Israel in the 1967 war,
promising Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat full support in peace
talks and his efforts to establish an independent state.
</P>
<P>
-- Political candidates are doggedly bowing and pleading for
votes across Japan in anticipation of election on Sunday, as Japan
engages in a national experiment aimed at producing a more
responsive political system.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole unleashed his
most stinging attack of the U.S. presidential campaign, accusing
President Bill Clinton of diminishing the presidency through a
pattern of evasion, half-truth and violations of "public trust".
</P>
<P>
-- While the rising cost of college is one reason education has
catapulted to the top of voter concerns in U.S. presidential
election, many schools are facing other issues: unqualified or
poorly paid teachers, stagnant national scores in reading and
overcrowded classrooms.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- CSX agreed to buy Conrail for cash and stock valued at 8.1

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Researchers Develop Chip to Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A team of Jerusalem
researchers has successfully developed an electronic chip that
can aid the surgeons in heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
The chip, capable of creating an image from an object's
thermal radiation, was developed by researchers in the Jerusalem
College of Technology (JCT), The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Its many applications include the identification -- during
open-heart surgery -- of blocked blood vessels. It will replace
bulky and much more expensive electronic and mechanical devices.
</P>
<P>
The chip functions in a thermal-sensing camera in a way
similar to that of a retina in the human eye, and contains
16,000 tiny thermal-radiation detectors, the report said..
</P>
<P>
The development, by Dr. Shmuel Borenstein, was conducted in
cooperation with Opgal Industries of Karmiel and with the Center
for Sub-micron Technology at the Weizman Institute in Rehovot.
</P>
<P>
In heart surgery, the chip can be used by surgeons to verify
proper blood-flow in vessels grafted as coronary bypasses, before
the patient is sewn up.
</P>
<P>
Blocked blood vessels radiate a lower heat-level than healthy
ones, making the detection of problems possible with the use of
the new thermal sensor, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the use of such a medical system for open-heart
surgery is prohibitively expensive. But the JCT sensor will allow
for widespread use of thermal imaging for commercial
applications.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji on Grain Purchase (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The vice-premier asked all local governments to meet the
financial demands for grain purchase by coordinating concerned
departments to raise grain purchase funds and ensure timely supply
of the funds, including policy subsidiaries of local governments,
funds recovered by grain purchase departments and other funds
allocated by banks.
</P>
<P>
Zhu reiterated that paying farmers in IOUs and illegally using
special funds for grain purchase is prohibited, stressing that any
unit or individual who violates the rule will be severely dealt
with. There will be no tolerance in the event such situations
occur, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He quoted figures provided by auditing departments in a survey
in 100 counties, which disclose that 30 percent of the funds was
illegally used in 1995, while the figure has increased to 40
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the long-time insufficient grain storage capacity,
Zhu noted that the central and local governments will increase
their investment in the construction of grain storage facilities
by making this an infrastructural issue in the marketing field.
</P>
<P>
He proposed temporary measures to solve the current shortage of
grain storage facilities, which include making use of excess
storage space of factories, material-supply departments and
railways. During the period when the autumn crops are transported,
all railways, highways and waterways should give priority to grain
shipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-premier, the grain issue is facing the
best situation reported in the past few years, as the domestic
grain market is currently balanced and the prices are stable,
while on the international market, prices are falling.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he noted, the domestic grain market is
experiencing changes, as the sales in non-government markets are
increasing notably and state-owned grain dealers are seeing a
heavy decline in their grain sale, leading to soaring losses in
these departments. This is a serious problem under a new
situation, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged government grain-dealing units to reform the old
structure, which could not meet the demands of a socialist market
economy and is destined to be reorganized. Now is the right time
to reform it under such a good situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The reform should be conducted in line with the principles set
by the State Council in 1994 to implement the restructuring of the
grain marketing system, he said.
</P>
<P>
State-owned grain dealers should be commercialized in order to
simplify procedure, strengthen management, improve service, reduce
cost and become profitable, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Nationwide Law Consultation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,200 law consultants
have taken to the streets of urban and suburban areas of Beijing
as part of a nationwide program organized by the Ministry of
Justice to help the people solve their legal problems.
</P>
<P>
The program was hosted by legal service centers around the
country on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The centers were established by judicial departments at
township or community levels in the early 1980s to meet the demand
of China's economic reform and promote the socialist democratic
and legal construction.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 35,000 such grassroots centers which
employ 110,000 legal personnel. To be accepted into the program,
the workers must pass examinations given by local governments and
judicial departments.
</P>
<P>
The workers provide legal consultation services, write legal
documents for clients, handle civil lawsuits and notarization
papers, and promote public awareness of the country's laws,
regulations and policies.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the ministry, grassroots law
service centers have offered consultations for 410,000 work units
around the country.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995, the centers handled 1.41 million civil
lawsuits and 4.18 million cases which never made it to court,
wrote 16 million draft notarization papers and 5.4 million law
documents, and offered legal consultations for 25 million people.
</P>
<P>
"Responding to the demand of the socialist market economy, the
great numbers of grassroots law service centers have made active
efforts to offer various legal services, and they have played an
active and unique role in enhancing social and economic
development, ensuring social stability, and promoting socialist
ethical and cultural progress," said Zhang Geng, vice-minister of
justice.
</P>
<P>
"The service centers have exerted great energy, and the quality
of workers in the legal profession is improving," Zhang said,
adding that the service centers will play an even bigger role in
the future.

<HEADLINE> ADBC Grants More Low-Interest Loans to Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural Development Bank
of China (ADBC), which was set up in June 1994 by the central
government as a major state-owned policy bank, has been making
great efforts to improve its financial assistance to
poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
According to ADBC sources, by the end of September, the
outstanding low-interest loans had topped 22.46 billion yuan, up
114 percent over June 1994 when it was founded.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the bank has insisted on giving the
soft loans only to the 592 poor counties included in the current
national poverty eradication program. This year, 80 percent of
ADBC's loans are scheduled to go to the underdeveloped western
areas.
</P>
<P>
To improve its management of poverty-alleviation loans, the
bank has adopted a responsibility system which holds directors of
the headquarters and branches responsible for the work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank has stipulated a series of rules and
regulations to strengthen the management and distribution of
loans.

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn Of AIDS Threat In China   (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has a high population density, and an increasingly mobile
population as a result of reforms and opening-up, creating a "bed"
for the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
There are three major ways of transmitting HIV: through sexual
contact, contact with contaminated blood, or being passed on by an
HIV-infected mother. All have emerged in China, but the public are
less informed about the disease and are lacking in self-protection.
</P>
<P>
The experts said they are afraid that the next battleground for
HIV/AIDS after Africa may be China, if strong efforts are not made
to hold the infection to its present relatively low level.
</P>
<P>
Ulrich Eckle, economic and development co-operation counselor
with the EU Delegation of the European Commission, said that China
should learn from its neighboring countries. The chances are good
for reigning it in before it bursts its banks and runs out of
control into the population at large, he said.
</P>
<P>
By June 1996, some 193 countries and regions around the world
had reported HIV/AIDS, with the total number of cases estimated at
27.9 million, including 20.4 million in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of reported AIDS patients has gone up
to 1.39 million people. However, experts involved estimate that
the total number of AIDS patients is 7.7 million, 5.8 million of
the patients having died, accounting for 75 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, when the first AIDS patient was discovered in
China, the number of the HIV cases in the country has risen to
4,305, including 131 AIDS patients. So far, out of China's 30
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, 28 have been
found to have HIV/AIDS cases. Experts estimate that the actual
number of cases today is between 50,000 and 100,000.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Emphasizes Agricultural Development in Large Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Large cities should give top
priority to agriculture, even though its place in their economy is
shrinking, Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun said during an inspection
tour of China's largest city from October 13 through today.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental position of agriculture must be reinforced

</P>
<P>
If the foundation of agriculture is not solid, the development
of cities and the raising of the urban residents' living standards

due importance to agriculture, and fully tap their special
advantages to more rapidly industrialize and modernize the
industry.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Premier commended the leadership of Shanghai for the
measures it has taken to support and protect agriculture, saying
that suburban Shanghai has played an exemplary role in modernizing
agriculture and building a new, socialist countryside.
</P>
<P>
Industrializing agriculture on the basis of the household
contract responsibility system, which was first introduced when
China launched the reform and opening-up drive in the late 1970s,
is an effective means to step up modernization in the farming
sector, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He called for greater efforts for the "Vegetable Basket
Project," in order to ensure an ample supply of sideline
agricultural products for city dwellers and promote the
development of agriculture and the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
"The vegetable basket has a bearing on urban development and
stability," Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Premier said that efforts should also be made to
deepen the reform of the distribution system, thereby creating
conditions for farmers to enter the market.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers and rural officials must upgrade their concepts and
decide what to produce and develop in respect to the needs of the
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also highlighted the urgency to promote socialist ethical
and cultural progress in the countryside.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong-based Hang Seng
Bank Corporation (HSBC) Life (International) Ltd. and Sun Life of
Canada signed a contract here today in a joint effort to further
tap the local retirement scheme market.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, Sun Life will market the
"Wayfoong Multi-funding System", a retirement scheme developed and
 offered by HSBC Life, through its network of over 230 agents
across the territory.
</P>
<P>
Alwin Lam, vice-president of Hong Kong and China Operations at
Sun Life, said the potential of the local pension fund market is
enormous and it is growing.
</P>
<P>
Statistics about Hong Kong show that only one third of its
three million working population is protected by private
retirement fund schemes. There are only 17,000 registered pension
funds operating in the community with a growing population of
senior citizens and generally longer life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
HSBC Life is a pension fund specialized in offering a wide
range of well-designed products and commanding a 25 percent share
of the local market.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Uzbek Militia led by
Rashid Dostum have advanced towards Kabul and reached Jabul Saraj,
77 kilometers north of Kabul, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Dostum's forces moved south from their
original positions at the Salang pass, about 120 kilometers north
of Kabul, and gathered outside Jabul Saraj.
</P>
<P>
Jabul Saraj, the strategic hub of communications in northern
Afghanistan, is in the hands of the ousted government troops led
by Ahmad Shah Masood now.
</P>
<P>
Dostum's frontline commanders had held talks with Masood near
Jabul Saraj, but so far, there is no information about what
decision they have made.
</P>
<P>
Dostum, a major rival of Masood during the past two years,
declared last Friday to join hands with the ousted government
against the Taliban, which captured Kabul on September 27 and have
controlled two-thirds of the Afghan territory.

<HEADLINE> Random Dope Testing Proved to be Effective Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Prince Alexandre de Merode,
chairman of the IOCC's medical commission, said Random testing is
proving to be one of the most effective weapons in trapping
athletes who use drugs.
</P>
<P>
De Merode said that the life-banned British Olympic bobsled
star Mark Tout Wednesday in Monte Carlo was fully aware of what he
was doing, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Tout, 35, tested positive for Stanazol in an out-of-competition
check conducted by the British Sports Council.
</P>
<P>
Stanazol was the anabolic steroid which led to Canadian
sprinter Ben Johnson's disgrace at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"The way he (Tout) was caught vindicates our emphasis on random
testing," said de Merode, who is in Monaco for the 30th Congress
of the General Association of International Sports Federations.
</P>
<P>
The IOC advocates a two-year ban for steroid offenses, but the
bob-sled federation favors a life one.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Councillors Pay First Visit to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of nine members
of the Palestinian Council today visited Israel's Knesset
(Parliament) to the warm welcome by Israel's major opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such visit made by Palestinian lawmakers.
The delegation was invited by the Hadash party, which has
five seats in the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The delegation included Marwan Barghouti, General-Secretary of
the Fatah Movement in the West Bank, and Hattem Abdel Khader, who
was the focus of a recent dispute regarding his office in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Major opposition parties including Labor, Meretz and Arab
Democratic Party welcomed the Palestinian delegation, which held
talks with Labor's deputy Speaker of Knesset Shevach Weiss.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian councillors called on the Israeli parliament to
urge the government to honor Oslo peace accords signed with the
Palestinians and support establishment of an independent
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Taleb Sanaa, a member of Knesset (MK) from the
Arab Democratic Party, held a caucus in the Knesset to promote
creation of a future Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its
capital. Arab party MKs and Meretz joined the caucus, along with
two Labor MKs.
</P>
<P>
Although a few members from the ruling Likud party also
met today with the Palestinian delegation, Likud's coalition
Chairman Michael Eitan has expressed anger at the Hadash's
invitation of the Palestinian lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Eitan said such a visit would be "provocative
and for propaganda purposes." He accused the Hadash MKs of
"serving as the PLO's public relations agents in the Knesset."
</P>
<P>
However, Hadash faction Chairman Salah Salim termed Sunday
the invitation as "our modest contribution to reviving and
saving the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"We very much hope the relationship between the two
parliaments will grow stronger and in the near future. Our
Palestinian friends will be the official guests of all the
factions in the House, or at least most of them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Likud government has ruled out the possibility of
establishing an independent Palestinian state in the future.

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn Of AIDS Threat In China  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A UNDP official today warned
that AIDS is a threat to China, and called for efforts to curb the
outbreak of the HIV virus in the country, because "Unlike India
and Thailand, China still has the opportunity to stop the further
spread."
</P>
<P>
UNDP representative Arther N. Holcombe, said however, at the
China National Conference on AIDS, that "we must not lose valuable
time."
</P>
<P>
Holcombe said that a UNDP study on the economic implications of
HIV/AIDS in Asian countries estimates that the cost to China in
terms of health care and lost labor could rise to two billion US
dollars annually by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the UNDP, EU, WHO, and the World Bank, and
Chinese scholars have reached a consensus, and are urging Chinese
governments at various levels to commit more resources to China's
long-term plan of action for HIV/AIDS prevention and control.They
say that stronger steps should be taken to curb the spread of
HIV/AIDS, and that the entire society should be acquainted with
the spread and be aware of the seriousness of the situation.
</P>
<P>
The WHO estimates that the total number of HIV cases in the
world may double by the year 2000, while the joint UN Program on
HIV/AIDS, called UNAIDS, estimates that, as of 1996, out of 27.9
million cases in the world, Asia currently ranks second with five
million, and Africa first with 18 million.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that even though HIV/AIDS is rampant in North
America, Europe and Africa, there are only a few reported cases in
Asia, and that little attention has been paid to the potential
spread of HIV/AIDS in Asia, and by 1988, the incidence had risen
dramatically in some countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
To date, the number of cases of HIV/AIDS in Thailand is
estimated at 750,000, and in India as high as from two to four
million, they said, adding that this is definitely a "time bomb".

<HEADLINE> Overseas Patent Applications Surge in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Overseas patent applications
in China have soared in recent years, in response to the country's
enhanced protection of intellectual property rights, a senior
patent official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Patent applications have come from over 80 countries and
regions, with the number of approved overseas patents exceeding
292,000, said Gao Lulin, director of the Patent Agency of China.
</P>
<P>
He told an on-going international seminar on the protection of
intellectual property rights that patent applications in China had
totalled 579,000 by the end of July, with those from overseas
accounting for 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ten countries and regions with the largest number of patent
applications in China are Japan, the United States, Germany, the
Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, France, Switzerland, Britain,
Holland and Italy, according to Gao.
</P>
<P>
Applications from Sweden, which has the 11th largest number,
have been growing with great momentum, rising from 70 in 1994 to
the current 214, Gao noted.
</P>
<P>
China endorsed a patent law in April of 1985 and revised it in
1992. Experts say the revised law, which extended the duration of
patent protection from 15 to 20 years, conforms with both the
international standards and China's realities.
</P>
<P>
The revised law also expanded its coverage to include food,
pharmaceuticals and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
"The revised law meets the standards set forth by the Agreement
on Intellectual Property Rights Related to Trade for developing
countries ahead of schedule," Gao said.
</P>
<P>
In January of 1994, China became a member of the Patent
Cooperation Treaty.

MOSCOW, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma, or lower
house of parliament, today rejected the draft 1997 federal budget
proposed by the government, describing its basic principles as
"unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers turned down the bill through a vote of 273-83
with 12 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution adopted today, the Duma criticized the bill
for an "absence of changes in the economic course, investment and
social orientation".
</P>
<P>
While discussing the bill in the first reading on October 11,
many lawmakers were against it.
</P>
<P>
Today's resolution suggested that the government should "change
the main characteristics of the budget, taking into account the
findings of the Committee on Budget, Taxes, Banks and Finance and
the Committee on Economic Policy" as well as the proposals from
Duma groups.
</P>
<P>
The Duma did not set a deadline for the cabinet to finalize the
draft budget.
</P>
<P>
However, it decided that the reconciliatory commission
including representatives of both chambers of the parliament and
the government will begin working as soon as the draft budget is
submitted to the Duma for a second reading.

BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- With Chinese cities growing
rapidly in number and in scale, the construction of urban traffic
facilities and improving the management of city streets to deal
with its growing traffic congestion has become an urgent new
development.
</P>
<P>
China faces a glaring contradiction between the huge increase

poor urban traffic facilities and poor management.

Traffic problems are in urgent need of a solution, according to
senior officials at the construction, communications, and public

exhibition today.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that China is witnessing rapid urbanization
nationwide and has 640 cities, including 32 with population in
excess of one million. The rapid growth in population and traffic
volume has caused the traffic congestion and number of accidents
to increase.
</P>
<P>
They said that Chinese cities should strictly limit expansion
and the influx of population, and should do their urban planning
scientifically, giving top priority to traffic facilities and city
streets.

possible effort to curb the HIV/AIDS epidemic."
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, China had reported 4,305 cases of the HIV
virus, including 131 AIDS patients. But experts estimate that the
actual number of the country's HIV cases is now between 50,000 to
100,000.
</P>
<P>
Out of 27 provinces and autonomous regions and three
municipalities -- Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin -- 28 have
reported HIV/AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
Health officials and AIDS control experts attending the
conference warned that China, with the world's largest population,
will see its number of HIV cases spinning out of control if
preventive measures are not taken immediately.
</P>
<P>
"Serious HIV/AIDS epidemics in neighboring countries may have
an impact on the domestic HIV epidemic, and a large number of
migrants provide the opportunity for the spread of HIV infection,"
claimed Health Minister Chen Minzhang.
</P>
<P>
"A general unawareness of HIV/AIDS, drug abuse, prostitution,
illegal blood supply and the drastic increase of sexually
transmitted disease cases may also contribute to the HIV/AIDS
epidemic," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the prime time for prevention and control of HIV
infection -- it could be the last chance. We have no time to
waste," he said.

<HEADLINE> Officials Say China Has No Time to Waste to Control AIDS (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health has drafted national mid-term and
long-term plans of action for HIV/AIDS prevention and control, and
has listed AIDS as one of key diseases to be controlled by the end
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Health departments will continue to launch campaigns against
illegal blood banks in order to ensure the safety of blood
transfusions, according to the conference reports.
</P>
<P>
Health and educational organizations will join hands with the
mass media to further spread knowledge about HIV/AIDS among
officials, medics and ordinary people, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also plans to set up a national institute for
HIV/AIDS prevention and control and similar local organizations in
order to perfect the surveillance system.
</P>
<P>
Chinese law enforcement agencies will continue to crack down on
drug abuse and prostitution, aiming to reduce HIV transmission
through sexual contact and contact with contaminated blood.
</P>
<P>
Minister Chen said since China discovered its first AIDS case
in 1985, the ministry has assigned technical professionals to deal
with the reported cases, and created a specially-designed system
responsible for the prevention and control of the HIV/AIDS
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The surveillance system has been established in 30 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities, and many screening
laboratories have been set up.
</P>
<P>
He said the main transmission routes and general epidemic
overview has been determined through sero-screening among target
populations totalling seven million people.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Smuggling from Kenya Goes Up in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Smuggling of petroleum
products especially diesel, petrol and kerosene from Kenya is
rising in the Ugandan-Kenyan border districts.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said, no accurate statistics are
available but quantities worth millions of Shillings (1,100
Shillings equal to one US Dollar ) are smuggled into Uganda
daily.
</P>
<P>
Since April this year, the report said the cross-border
smuggling has risen sharply, crippling the operations of major
dealers including Cattex, Agip, Gapco and Shell.
</P>
<P>
Cattex has closed its petrol stations in Buriri and Tororo
near the border with Kenya, because it cannot compete with
smugglers, while Gapco is seeking new proprietors for all its
stations in eastern Uganda because sales have dropped 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Smuggling is on the rise because the anti-smuggling unit was
disbanded mid this year during presidential campaigns in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Fuel costs more in Uganda than that of Kenya because of higher
taxes. enditem

<HEADLINE> Feature: Macao Airport Reports Good Operation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Hong Kong new airport is built at a high cost and its
charges and fees will be higher than those of the Macao airport,"
he said. "On the other hand, the Macao airport is not competing
with Hong Kong. Instead, it will do the part of business that the
Hong Kong airport ignores."
</P>
<P>
He believes that the lower charges due to a lower consumption
level in Macao will attract more passengers to Macao for a short
stay. It is also convenient for the passengers to fly from Macao
to cities in China's mainland as more air routes are opened.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the cargo transportation business needs to be
 expanded, but he is optimistic about future business.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, some 60 percent of China's exports are transported
 via the Hong Kong airport," he said. "In the future, the Macao
airport can gain some business because of its lower charges."
</P>
<P>
He revealed that after Macao signed air agreements with the
United States not long ago, some U.S. cargo transport companies
are considering using the Macao airport as a regional center of
transfer.
</P>
<P>
Air Macao is also optimistic about its future. Deputy-General
Manager Zhou Yunda said his company is working out a five-year
development blueprint.
</P>
<P>
"We will expand our fleet and increase international air routes
 so that Macao will be linked with more destinations around the
world and within China's inland," he said.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to add two aircraft each year to its fleet
and to have at least 12 planes by the year 2000. Air routes will
also be opened to a number of destinations in China's mainland,
including Wuhan, Qingdao, Haikou, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Guilin and
Fuzhou, in the near future.
</P>
<P>
It expects to start regular flights to the Republic of Korea in
 two years and to Sydney, Australia, by 1999.
</P>
<P>
To meet the demand of growing business, dozens of local
technicians and management personnel are now being trained. More
local citizens will join the staff of the airport and Air Macao.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 60 percent of the airport staff are local Macao
citizens or from China's mainland. The ratio of local workers will
 increase sharply after 1999, according to Joao de Suosa Moreira,
the chairman.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 24 Macao students are now studying at the Nanjing
University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, majoring in aircraft
dynamic engineering, transportation, electronics and information,
among others.
</P>
<P>
Upon graduation in the year 2000, they will become the first
group of high-level aviation technical and management personnel in
 Macao.

<HEADLINE> Britain Likely to Ban Handguns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government, under
increasing pressure from the public, is likely to announce a ban
on handguns across the country later today.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports described Prime Minister John Major as
being pressed hard by his cabinet and the general public to
declare a complete ban on handguns following the appalling
massacre in March.
</P>
<P>
A gunman killed 16 children aged five and six and a woman
teacher in the Dunblane Primary School in Scotland before killing
himself with the gun.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street meeting decided on Tuesday that the government
would outlaw the ownership of handguns and order handguns to be
handed in.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed ban, the only handgun Britons are expected
to be allowed to hold is the 0.22 calibre pistols as those used in
sports competitions, but they must be kept in gun clubs.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman today refused to confirm the press
reports ahead of official government statements, saying "the
government will set out its views to the House of Commons this
afternoon".
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say the ban, which will give Britain one of the
world's toughest gun regulations, will outrage shooting
organizations which have lobbied hard to protect the rights of
their members.
</P>
<P>
Major shooting incidents are rare in Britain. In 1987,
27-year-old Michael Ryan rampaged through his home town killing or
fatally wounding 16 people before turning his gun to himself.

<HEADLINE> Somalis Welcome Agreement Reached by Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The people here reacted
differently today to the agreement reached by three major
Somali faction leaders in Nairobi, Kenya, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Imam Mohamud Imam Omar, one of the major traditional leaders
in Mogadishu, said he welcomed the agreement and
characterized it as a good step forward. "It is good to see
Mogadishu's rival politicians meet once more, and it is also good
to hear that they made pledgres to continue dialogue inside the
country."
</P>
<P>
Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdid, the Secretary General of the
faction led by Osman Atto in Mogadishu, said they also welcomed
the agreement. "We are waiting from our leaders the modalities
of its implementation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the people in Medina District of South Mogadishu
seemed to have relieved by the news after they have been in
a tight siege by militiamen loyal to another faction leader
Hussein Aidid for three months. Many people and public
transport owners have made a happy march on the streets in
Medina in support for the agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, some politicians have characterized the agreement
as a political stunt meant not to embarrass Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi in his effort to mediate between the Somali
warring parties.
</P>
<P>
Politician Abdurahman Hassan said "the whole issue seemed to
have been an introduction of Hussein Aidid to the other two
faction leaders." "They would have talked seriously about their
political differences. They seem to be avoiding where the real
problem lies."
</P>
<P>
Three Somali faction leaders -- Hussein Mohamed Aidid, Ali
Mahdi Mohamed and Osman Atto -- reached an agreement on a
cessation of hostitilies in Nairobi, Kenya, yesterday after
week-long face-to-face talks. enditem

<HEADLINE> PLA General Staff Chief Holds Talks with Turkish Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, Chief of the
General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), held
talks here this afternoon with his Turkish counterpart Ismail
Hakki Karadayi, exchanging views on issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Fu, also member of the Central Military Commission, expressed
his belief that Karadayi's current visit to China would surely
further the friendship between the two countries and their armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Fu recalled his visit to Turkey last November and extended his
warm welcome to Karadayi, who is on his first visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Fu, also member of the Central Military Commission, said that
Sino-Turkish friendship dates back to ancient times, and bilateral
relations have continued to develop since the two countries
established diplomatic relations 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, there have been constant exchanges of
visit between leaders of the two countries and the two armed
forces, Fu recalled, which helped enhance understanding and
friendship between the two peoples and their armed forces and laid
a firm foundation for friendship and cooperation between the two
countries and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Karadayi's current visit to China indicates a new
development in the friendship between the two sides, adding that
China pays much attention to this visit.
</P>
<P>
China holds a positive attitude toward furthering friendship
and cooperation between the two armed forces and is ready to
further strengthen all-round and reciprocal cooperation between
them, Fu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China adheres to an independent foreign policy of
peace and opposes hegemonism, power politics and aggression of any
form.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's national defense policy is defensive, Fu
said that China is concentrating itself on economic construction,
and the "China threat" is spread by some westerners who have
ulterior motives, and is completely groundless.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his appreciation for the "one China" policy
Turkey follows.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Fu briefed the Turkish visitors on his views
on the international situation, and China's domestic situation and
military building.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi said that Turkey and China have very good cooperation
in politics, economy and culture, and his country values the
friendship and cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Turkey hopes to further increase exchanges and cooperation
between the two countries and the two armed forces in various
fields and at different levels, added Karadayi.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Fu presided over a welcoming ceremony for
Karadayi, who arrived here Tuesday as Fu's guest for an official
goodwill visit to China.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish visitors are also scheduled to visit Shanghai,
Xi'an and Guilin.

<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China's largest compact car
manufacturer today began offering 250 million B shares for
overseas investors, expecting to raise funds worth 583 million
yuan (about 70 million US dollars) for expanded production.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Chang'an Automobile Co., Ltd, in southwest China's
Sichuan Province, produced 70,000 vehicles and sold 66,000 units
last year, garnering a market share of 20.2 percent in the country.
</P>
<P>
The funds raised through the share issue will be used to
finance an expansion project which will enable the company to
produce 150,000 compact cars and 240,000 engines and gearboxes a
year. The project, which has been submitted for official approval,
will also be supported by the State Development Bank and the
Export and Import Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The shares, at a par value of 2.03 yuan per unit, will be
offered until October 21 and then will be listed on the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange on November 15. Half of the shares have been
underwritten by Japan's Suzuki Incorporation.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China's production of compact

<HEADLINE> Feature: Macao Airport Reports Good Operation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Skepticism and doubts gave way to
 optimism and confidence one year after the Macao International
Airport went into operation.
</P>
<P>
The number of passengers and the amount of cargo transported
via the airport have grown steadily since the inauguration in
November 1995 of the airport, which was built on land reclaimed
from the sea.
</P>
<P>
Macao airport authorities report a good operation, forecasting
that the number of passengers traveling via the airport will have
reached 1.2 million by the end of the year, 1.6 million by end of
1997, and 1.8 million by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The construction and operation of the Macao airport have
embarked on a normal growing way," said Joao de Sousa Moreira,
chairman of the Board of Directors of the Macao International
Airport Company. "We expect to achieve balance and gain profits
after 1999."
</P>
<P>
Currently, a dozen airlines around the world have started
regular flights to Macao. They include those from Taiwan, the
Republic of Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Portugal, Thailand and
China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
Air Macao, in particular, has seen a growing business ever
since it launched quasi-direct flights across the Taiwan Straits,
flying Taiwan passengers from Taipei or Kaohsiung to Beijing,
Shanghai or Xiamen via Macao.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen a satisfactory business in the first year of
operation," said Zhou Yunda, deputy general manager of Air
Macao. "The seat occupancy rate on our flights grew from 29.7
percent in the beginning to 81 percent last August. We are happy
about this."
</P>
<P>
The company now has six regular flights and had transported
more than 484,000 passengers and 5,140 tons of cargo by the end of
 September. About half of the passengers came from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The achievements it made were described as "quite satisfactory"
 for the newly-established company, which faces fierce competition
 from neighboring regions and lacks experience in its operation.
</P>
<P>
Deputy General Manager Zhou attributed his company's success to
the good cooperation between the Chinese and Portuguese
governments.
</P>
<P>
"The good operation of Air Macao is the result of joint efforts
 of both the governments of China and Portugal, of the Macao
government and of many other people in Macao," he said. "Practice
has proved that the construction of the Macao airport is a correct
 decision by both China and Portugal. It (the airport) will become
 increasingly important to the economic growth and social
stability in Macao."
</P>
<P>
Practice in the past year or so also shows that the airport
built by reclaiming land from the sea is of high quality after
some 9,000 takeoffs and landings.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the runway on the artificial island of the airport
has evenly subsided less than three centimeters, which is within
the designed standard. The runway can totally meet the demands of
Boeing-747 aircraft in landing and taking off.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, some pilots have reported that the runway
 of the Macao airport is one of the best in the world, " said Cao
Jiansheng, deputy general manager of the Zhen Hua Harbor
Construction Co. Ltd., which built the artificial island.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Opens Wider Feedmeal Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has relaxed quota
restrictions on imports of feedmeal under its commitment to the
World Trade Organization (WTO), the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Thai ministers in charges of economic affairs have approved a
Commerce Ministry proposal for free imports of soybean meal with a
10 percent tariff.
</P>
<P>
The ministers at their recent meeting also approved imports of
maize between February 20 and June 30 next year with no duty or
surcharge.
</P>
<P>
The import amount will not be set but it will be controlled by
the Commerce Ministry to protect local planters within the
framework of WTO guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The 55,000 ton limit for maize imports set by the Commerce
Ministry earlier this year has been scrapped.
</P>
<P>
To protect local planters from impact of the imports, the Thai
commerce and agriculture ministries have required importers to buy
some local feedmeal before they obtain imported feedmeal and set
the minimum purchase prices.
</P>
<P>
The minimum purchase price for local soybean meal has been set
at 8.5 baht (0.34 US dollars) per kilogram and the price for maize
has seen set at 3.80-4.80 baht (0.15-0.19 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Fishmeal containing more than 60 percent protein can be freely
imported at a 6 percent tariff and 1,750 baht (70 dollars)
surcharge per ton.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government hoped that the new move would help the
local livestock industry reduce production costs and make Thai
export products more competitive.

<HEADLINE> Talks on power price going on between Kenya, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and Uganda are holding
talks on power price increase of Kenya's import electricity from
Uganda, "the East African Standard" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly quoted Mike Njeru, Public Relations Manager of the
Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC), as saying that his
company would continue with the on-going dialogue with Uganda to
sort out the power price issue.
</P>
<P>
An amicable solution is expected as soon as possible once KPLC
and Uganda Electricity Board agree on the price Kenya has to pay,
Njeru noted.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has been paying two U.S. Cents a unit for 30 megawatts
electricity imported from Uganda under an agreement signed in
1954 while the production cost has risen to six U.S. Cents per
unit.
</P>
<P>
Uganda sells a unit of electricity to Rwanda and Tanzania at
the price of eight U.S. Cents.
</P>
<P>
The KPLC official said the pricing issue came up last year
when Kenya was ready to raise the contract price to 3.5 U.S.
Cents a unit while Uganda insisted on the price of 5.5 U.S.
Cents.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's power consumption is higher than its production
level, but the contract signed during the colonial days ties it
to supplying 30 megawatts to Kenya until the year 2004.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Impound Drug-carrying Ships, Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria announced that ships and
aircraft used for hard drug trafficking in the country will be
impounded as part of renewed efforts to stop the illicit trade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, air and shipping line operators who transport drug
couriers or on whose vessels drugs are detected at any of
Nigeria's air or seaports are to be penalized, said Major-General
Musa Bamaiyi, Chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement
Agency (NDLEA) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is no longer going to be an acceptable practice for any
airline or shipping line operators to simply wash off their
hands, should their vessels be involved in transporting or
ferrying such drugs," the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Bamaiyi disclosed that a total of 624 persons were arrested in
the first nine months of this year with various types of
"narcotics and psychotropic substances weighing 12,592.245 kg"
which were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 170,000 kg of Indian hemp has been
destroyed during the "operation burn the weeds" campaign launched
by NDLEA this year, the chairman said, adding "this feat has
surpassed our level of achievement for last year."
</P>
<P>
Bamaiyi, an advocate of death penalty to drug traffickers,
said if the decree on capital punishment was promulgated into
law, over 99 percent of drug barons would take to other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
On the United States' refusal to recognize Nigeria as a drug
free nation, Bamaiyi accused the U.S. government of "politicizing
the global drug war by maliciously castigating tangible efforts
of some countries, particularly Nigeria, for not serving
America's interest."
</P>
<P>
He also debunked an allegation that the U.S. government had
been supporting Nigeria financially to fight the drug war.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Records Big Trade Surplus in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia posted a big
external trade surplus for August this year against a big deficit
for the previous month, provisional figures released today showed.
</P>
<P>
The August trade surplus amounted to 600.7 million ringgit
(about 240.28 million U.S. dollars) compared with a deficit of
614.966 million ringgit (about 245.986 million U.S. dollars) in
July, the Statistics Department said.
</P>
<P>
Exports in August totaled 17.22 billion ringgit (about 6.887
billion U.S. dollars) while imports were valued at 16.62 billion
ringgit (about 6.65 billion U.S. dollars), registering growth
rates of 8.3 percent and 0.6 percent respectively when compared
with those in July, according to interim data released by the
department.
</P>
<P>
The department said that in the first eight months of this
year, Malaysia recorded a smaller trade deficit of 835.48 million
ringgit (about 334.19 million U.S. dollars) compared with a
deficit of 8.05 billion ringgit (about 3.22 billion U.S. dollars)
in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The reduced trade deficit was a result of higher export growth
to 129.58 billion ringgit (about 51.83 billion U.S. dollars)
during the first eight months of this year, an increase of 10.1
percent compared to that in the corresponding period of last year.
 Imports totaled 130.42 billion ringgit (about 52.17 billion U.S.
dollars), a mere 3.8 percent increase over the 1995 January-August
period, it said.
</P>
<P>
Thermonic valves and tubes, photocells and other parts as well
as palm oil continued to be Malaysia's leading export earners
during the period.
</P>
<P>
The major export destinations for Malaysian products in the
eight-month period were Singapore, the United States, Japan, Hong
Kong, Thailand, Taiwan, Britain, Germany and South Korea,
constituting 76.1 percent of the export total.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the biggest contributor to the increase of import
was machinery and transport equipment, mainly sourced from Japan,
the United States, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Germany,
Thailand, Australia and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Cut Energy Demand Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will pursue
ways to curtail the country's annual energy demand growth rate
from 13 percent to below 10 percent during the next five years
(1997-2001).
</P>
<P>
The measures will be geared towards more efficient consumption
and conservation of energy and reduction of environmental impacts
created by the use of energy.
</P>
<P>
Among key measures to be adopted by the National Energy Policy
Office are the restructuring of prices of several oil products to
reflect their economic cost and marketing forces with no political
intervention, while narrowing down the gaps of oil prices in
Bangkok and the provinces.
</P>
<P>
Other priority measures include adjustment of the electricity
tariff, both on the retail and wholesale levels, to reflect the
economic cost of production realistically.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, pricing of natural gas and its transportation charge
through the pipeline will be made more transparent and more
reasonable to help reduce the cost of power generation.
</P>
<P>
The office has also proposed to produce energy-efficient
electrical appliances and to promote a public campaign on energy
conservation.

<HEADLINE> Poor Quality Ruins Nigerian Cocoa in World Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, one of the world's
leading cocoa producers and exporters, has witnessed a
diminishing share in the international market because of the poor
quality of its cocoa.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cocoa Association of Nigeria (CAN), the
country's cocoa export to Europe in 1994 had a high moisture
content and poor quality preparation, making it unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The output of cocoa in Nigeria has been on the decline in
recent years. This, together with the problem of low quality, has
drawn concern from major producers and dealers in the country.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting held here on cocoa production and export,
participants blamed the problem of poor quality on the
liberalization of cocoa export effected ten years ago with the
scrapping of the Nigeria Cocoa Board.
</P>
<P>
This opened the way for new comers who lacked experience to
cope with the increasing demand for cocoa beans for export, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria now ranks sixth in world cocoa production, next only
to Cote d'Voire, Brazil, Ghana, Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the country produced 300,000 tons of
cocoa in 1971. Between 1993-1994 season and 1995-1996 season,
total output fell by 20,000 tons from 150,000 tons to 130,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Nigeria exported 118,744 tons of cocoa beans, a drop
of about 18.1 percent from the 136,161 tons in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, an official in Ondo State, Nigeria's cocoa
production base in the south, warned that if a drastic solution
was not found to the dwindling fortune of cocoa, Nigeria might
fall short of its cocoa export needs by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Ondo State turns out more than 60 percent of the country's
cocoa production. Cocoa farmers in the state reaped 74,000 tons
of cocoa beans in1993. But in 1994 and 1995, their production
fell to 50,000 and 40,000 tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
To change the situation, according to Ondo State Commissioner
for Agriculture Babatunde Fakayode, the state government is
intending to increase cocoa production by expanding cocoa farm
land.
</P>
<P>
With the cocoa price put at about 1,500 U.S. Dollars per ton
in the current international market, premium price is assured for
Nigerian cocoa if Nigerian farmers succeed in improving the
quality of their products, local experts said.

</P>
<P>
Shanghai launched a "Rising Star" program in 1991 to encourage

<HEADLINE> Dostum Recognizes Afghan Gov't Led by Rabbani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Uzbek Militia leader
Rashid Dostum has recognized the legitimacy of the ousted Afghan
government led by President Burhanuddin Rabbani, an Afghan party
representative said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Ghairat Baheer, the representative
of Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar Group) in Pakistan and son-in-law of
Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, said, "The Taliban
regime in Kabul would not be recognized by Pakistan in the near
future."
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistani Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar visited
both Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif, the headquarters of Dostum in
northern Afghanistan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the visit was to bring the Taliban leadership and
Dostum to the negotiating table, he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Baheer said Ismael Khan, the former
governor of Herat province in western Afghanistan, has not
launched any major offensive on the Taliban-controlled Herat city.
</P>
<P>
"But there were some sporadic clashes in that area," he added.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the Taliban's capture of Kabul last month
has greatly changed the Afghan situation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Dostum, a major rival of Rabbani, declared last Friday to join
hands with Rabbani's government against the Taliban. His
recognition of Rabbani's legitimacy further isolated the Taliban
which have not won much internal and international support so far.

HANGZHOU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The GDP of Zhejiang Province
in east China jumped to the fifth place in the country in 1995
from the 14th in 1979.
</P>

up to promote the programs, and local scientists and technicians
are expected to focus on the crucial areas of agriculture,
electronic information, automatic controls, chemistry, new
materials, bio-engineering, machinery, energy, and environment
protection.

Zhejiang is one of the earliest provinces to adopt a rural
science and technology program. 4,000 projects, which have been
established according to the program, has had 50 billion yuan in
output value, and generate and saved some 1.5 billion U.S. dollars
in the past ten years. The province is now one of China's
technologically-advanced areas, and had some 50 billion yuan in
output value in its high-tech industry in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Ecstasy Abuse, Problem with Lower Strata in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Ecstasy abuse in Singapore is
prevalent among the lower strata of society and the government
agencies concerned would further strengthen laws to tackle the
problem, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officials said today.
</P>
<P>
A Central Narcotics Bureau study on Ecstasy abuse released
today showed more than three-quarters of Ecstasy abusers were aged
30 and below and more than 95 percent of those arrested were
blue-collared Chinese males in their twenties with low levels of
education.
</P>
<P>
A total of 365 people were arrested for Ecstasy abuse by August
this year. The CNB said its study showed that unlike the situation
in Western countries, the Ecstasy problem here had not extended to
the mainstream upper and middle-income groups of the society.
</P>
<P>
One reason for this, Deputy Director Tan Seck Kang said, "could
be the strong signal that all Ecstasy abusers will be severely
dealt with by the law."
</P>
<P>
The CNB said it planned to further publicize the tough laws on
Ecstasy abuse especially among high risk groups through talks at
schools and visits to drug rehabilitation centers.

<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of star-rated hotels
in China reached 1,971 by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
Among the star-rated hotels, 44 are five-star and 113 four-star
hotels. Another 607 were awarded three-star status, according to a
recent meeting marking World Standard Day.
</P>
<P>
Last year the star-rated hotels in China earned an income of
more than 48.4 billion yuan (6 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The star-classification system has become the leading standard
in China's hotel industry, helping the industry make major
economic return. It has pushed the development of China's hotel
industry toward a higher level, and has had a wide influence at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
But star rating does not stop only at hotels in China. The
country now has star-rated apartments, villas, hospitals, and even
shop employees. The idea of star-classification has encouraged
people to offer high-level and excellent service in all social
sectors.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Senate to Pass Excise Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' new Senate
leadership today assured President Fidel Ramos that it would
immediately pass the excise tax bill so that it could be taken up
by the bicameral conference committee before the Congress goes
into recess on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said the new Senate gave
this assurance amid concerns that the senators had suspended
discussions on vital pieces of legislation after the "united
opposition" controlled the Senate in an unexpected reshuffle on
October 10.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Senate Ways and Means Committee
submitted to the Senate leadership on Tuesday its amended version
of a House specific tax bill, recommending the adoption of a
three-tier specific tax system on beer and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The new tax system adopts straight specific tax for all types
of liquor and cigarettes and increases dues on distilled spirits,
quite different from the one passed by the House.
</P>
<P>
The Senate's version of the excise tax reform is expected to
bring an additional revenue of 7 billion pesos (267 million US
dollars) to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The excise tax reform is just one of the three parts of the
Ramos administration's Comprehensive Tax Reform Package designed
to bring in billions of pesos more for its coffers to finance the
requirements of its governance.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's head of state General Sani
Abacha on Tuesday called for an urgent articulation of programs of
rail development and management.
</P>
<P>
Speacking at the opening of the 24th General Assembly of the
Union of African Railways in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, Abacha
said the present railway system bequeanthed to african nations by
their colonial masters is outmoded, inefficient and totally out
of tune with modern day realities.
</P>
<P>
"In order to reverse this ugly state of affairs, African
nations must pay more attention to rail development at national,
sub-regional and regional levels," Abacha told delegates from
about 70 African member states of the union.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the crucial role a modern railway system can play
in socio-economic and political transformation, Nigeria has
embarked on a comprehensive rehabilitation of its railway system,
with the help of Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government would also endeavour to extend railway
lines to the new industrial, commercial and population centers of
the country. It would also provide the necessary leadership for
the inter-country railway links to commence in the west African
sub-region, he added.

PHNOM PENH, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian government
hoped that the United States will grant the Generalized System of
Preferences (GSP) status to Cambodia soon, local newspapers today
quoted Cambodian Commerce Minister Cham Prasidh as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cham said he has submitted an application for the status to
Washington and he hoped it could be granted within three months.
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the GSP, which eliminates tariffs on selected
exports to the United States, Cambodia must ensure that a "proper"
labor law, guaranteering the rights of workers, is passed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia also have to adopt an internal quota system for
companies operating here to ensure that products are manufactured
domestically, not imported from elsewhere or re-exported, the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
Government officials must ensure that foreign companies do not
falsify registration records here in order to take advantage of
special privileges, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. this month granted Cambodia Most-Favored-Nation
trading status. The minister was just back from Washington after
signing the MFN accord.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Reports Good Grain Harvest in More Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A good grain harvest has been
reported in east China's Zhejiang province this year.
</P>
<P>
Information from local government departments shows that the
total grain output this year is expected to exceed 15 billion
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that governments at all levels have
attached great importance this year to grain production, which has
maintained last year's scale of planting.
</P>
<P>
The province reaped an extra 582 million kg of grain in the
early rice season. Late rice, and dry crops are said to be doing
well.
</P>
<P>
The province did well in grain purchase by raising the
purchase price of rice, and saw its grain stock by the end of
August increase by 300 million kg, compared with last year's
corresponding figure.
</P>
<P>
The increasing prospects have helped bring down the retail
price of rice, though the general price hike in the province was
recorded at seven percent, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, China is also expecting good
grain harvests in provinces such as Liaoning, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, as
well as in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, despite flooding in some
areas of the country in the summer.

<HEADLINE> Africa Needs Peace for Development, Says Abacha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's head of state General
Sani Abacha stressed on Tuesday the need for peace in Africa as a
vehicle for accelerated development in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In a message sent to an international seminar on national
unity, stability and development in Africa, Abacha reiterated
that his administration is determined to use dialogue in
resolving all social and political conflicts both in and outside
the country, especially with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
But he is disappointed with some African countries which are
unduly depending on foreign aid for their survival, a development
which he believes has caused them incalculatable harm.
</P>
<P>
According to Abacha, the lingering political crisis in
Liberia, Burundi, Somalia and Uganda and the increasing political
instability in Africa called for urgent redress from African
leaders.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to African nations that are still at war with one
another to lay down their arms for peace and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Abacha also reassured Nigerians living abroad and the
international community that the transition to civil rule program
in the country is on course, and Nigeria needs international
cooperation to realize vision 2010, the country's new economic
development strategy announced last month.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Economic Slowdown Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli economy
continued to slow down in the third quarter, the Jerusalem Post
reported today, citing a survey of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Bank of Israel said in a
seasonal survey of companies' activities Tuesday that the
construction and hotel sectors saw the biggest declines.
</P>
<P>
The performance of industrial, trade, transport, and
communication companies remained generally unchanged, after
taking into account seasonal changes.
</P>
<P>
Industrial companies reported no change in sales and orders
for local and export markets. Still, those companies registered a
drop in workers, for the second consecutive quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the construction sector, companies reported lower activity,
both in housing and other fields. The volume of
construction fell for the first time in many years, while
the level of finished structures remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
In the hotel industry, the companies reported a drop in
activity in comparison with their performance in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was due to a drop in overnight stays by tourists,
which was partly offset by a rise in the number of Israelis stay
at hotels here. The majority of hoteliers blamed the decline on
the security situation, adding that they expect to report a
further drop in activity in the fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> Israel Considers Forming Joint Hot Pursuit Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel is studying the
possibility of forming joint mobile units with Palestinian
Authority (PA) in order to break the deadlock over Hebron
redeployment, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The sticking point was Israeli army's insistence on being
able to pursue terrorists in Palestinian-controlled parts of
Hebron, the English-language daily quoted sources close to the
talks as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Jericho Tuesday, PA President Yasser
Arafat suggested that such units would be acceptable to him. But
it remains unclear whether Israel would accept the idea.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have insisted that Israeli soldiers cannot
act independently in so-called H1 area, or 80 percent of Hebron,
which is to come under the Palestinian control as stipulated by
the Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinian sources said that the issue of hot pursuit
could be resolved if Israel agreed that they would only enter H1
area in Hebron with Palestinian police, and that Palestinian
police have the same right to enter the Jewish quarter under the
Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army insisted on its right to act preemptively in H1
area if it receives warning of an impending attack against the
estimated 450 Jewish settlers in the town.
</P>
<P>
The final decision is expected to be made by Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Arafat, since this issue is the most
sensitive point of the negotiations. But whether the two leaders
would hold a summit remained unknown despite of earlier reports
that they might meet today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross is reportedly making intensive
mediation between the two leaders in order to solve the
issue. Ross met with Netanyahu in Jerusalem Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed talks in the
Egyptian resort of Taba Tuesday night. The talks are expected to
tackle the issues unrelated to the Hebron pullback, including
inspection arrangements insisted upon by Israel as a
prerequisite for the Palestinians to build Dahaniya airport in
the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The talks have been delayed for two days at the request of
Ross, who said the delay was proposed to allow more informal
contacts aimed at bridging wide gap between the two parties
before going into formal negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy Tuesday discussed current
situation with Likud Knesset (Parliament) faction, charging that
some PA officials "are spreading an atmosphere of pessimism as
if there is no progress and the talks have been halted."
</P>
<P>
"The talks haven't stopped. An effort is being put into
them. Israel is interested in making progress in the talks. I
can say we have made good progress in these subjects, although it
is the results which count," Levy said.
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in furthering the agreement and reaching a
conclusion while standing firm on the security and civil
issues. The talks are still going on and I hope we shall see the
desired conclusion in the next few days," he added.

<HEADLINE> Sumitomo to Post 15 Percent Rise in Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Sumitomo Electric
Industries Ltd. is expected to post a 15 percent rise in
unconsolidated pretax profit to about 33 billion yen for the
business year ending next March, Kyodo News Service quoted a
business daily as reporting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is one billion yen higher than the original projection,
the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
This is due to brisk sales of products related to personal
handy-phone systems and fiber-optic cables which are likely to
more than offset slack sales of electric cables to power
companies, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
As the largest maker of electric wires and cables in Japan, the
company will also benefit from lower costs due to its streamlined
production process, according to the daily.
</P>
<P>
Total sales for the year are projected to grow 5 percent from
the year before to 740 billion yen.

<HEADLINE> Second-hand Electronic Appliances Market Shows Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A thriving market for
second-hand goods is emerging in China.
</P>
<P>
With the supply and demand of old consumer electronics proving
to be high, there is an urgent need for a well-developed national
second-hand market, say officials.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the Ministry of Internal Trade, there
are about three million television sets, two million
refrigerators, and 30 million electric fans about to be replaced
by new ones in China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a large number of rural families want to buy
lower-priced second-hand electric goods to modernize their homes
at a modest cost.
</P>
<P>
In order to accelerate the building of the much-needed, but
still inadequate second-hand market, the Ministry has designated
six major cities, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Kunming and Fuzhou,
Harbin, to set up pilot second market regulation centers, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The experiment is aimed to facilitate the demand within the
cities themselves, as well the flow of used goods between cities
or urban areas and rural communities.
</P>
<P>
Business in these cities have already proved to be promising.
</P>
<P>
This year, Beijing has re-sold 60 percent of second-hand goods
within the city, while selling the rest to rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Total second-hand goods transactions in Beijing are expected to
reach over 50 million yuan (6.024 million US dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
In north China port city of Tianjin, there are now 10
second-hand goods purchasing outlets, in addition to five counters
in department stores.

<HEADLINE> Guinea Worm Likely to Be Eradicated in Nigeria by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is expected to record a
"zero case" in guinea worm elimination in 1998, an international
organization said here today.
</P>
<P>
"With reported guinea worm cases projected to be reduced to
about 10,000 by December and to about 4,000 a year later, Nigeria
should be free of the debilitating disease by 1998," said Wayne
Duncan, the new representative of "Global 2000" to the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the goal could be achieved only with a
dramatic increase in the level of financial and political
commitments.
</P>
<P>
Guinea worm, a parasitic nematode worm, which lodges under the
skin of man and some other mammals, enters the body in drinking
water and produces ulcers and swelling. It is common in Africa
and other warm countries.
</P>
<P>
Global 2000, in conjuction with the United Nations Children's Fund
and World Health Organization, is working toward a global elimination
of guinea worm in the 18 endemic countries, 16 of which are in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Poor Quality Ruins Nigerian Cocoa in World Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, one of the world's
leading cocoa producers and exporters, has witnessed a
diminishing share in the international market because of the poor
quality of its cocoa.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cocoa Association of Nigeria (CAN), the
country's cocoa export to Europe in 1994 had a high moisture
content and poor quality preparation, making it unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The output of cocoa in Nigeria has been on the decline in
recent years. This, together with the problem of low quality, has
drawn concern from major producers and dealers in the country.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting held here on cocoa production and export,
participants blamed the problem of poor quality on the
liberalization of cocoa export effected ten years ago with the
scrapping of the Nigeria Cocoa Board.
</P>
<P>
This opened the way for new comers who lacked experience to
cope with the increasing demand for cocoa beans for export, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria now ranks sixth in world cocoa production, next only
to Cote d'Voire, Brazil, Ghana, Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the country produced 300,000 tons of
cocoa in 1971. Between 1993-1994 season and 1995-1996 season,
total output fell by 20,000 tons from 150,000 tons to 130,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Nigeria exported 118,744 tons of cocoa beans, a drop
of about 18.1 percent from the 136,161 tons in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, an official in Ondo State, Nigeria's cocoa
production base in the south, warned that if a drastic solution
was not found to the dwindling fortune of cocoa, Nigeria might
fall short of its cocoa export needs by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Ondo State turns out more than 60 percent of the country's
cocoa production. Cocoa farmers in the state reaped 74,000 tons
of cocoa beans in1993. But in 1994 and 1995, their production
fell to 50,000 and 40,000 tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
To change the situation, according to Ondo State Commissioner
for Agriculture Babatunde Fakayode, the state government is
intending to increase cocoa production by expanding cocoa farm
land.
</P>
<P>
With the cocoa price put at about 1,500 U.S. Dollars per ton
in the current international market, premium price is assured for
Nigerian cocoa if Nigerian farmers succeed in improving the
quality of their products, local experts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government has
agreed to privatize the cotton company and is now working on
finer details of how the shareholding would be made up, with the
company hoping for a majority holding by indigenous Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
The decision, reached at a cabinet meeting yesterday, would
lead to enhancing performance and profitability while at the same
time helping the government, which is expected to dispose of some
of its shares to raise additional capital.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Denis Norman said the privatization of
the company had been proposed a long time ago. The national
planning commission would be the authority that would look into
the shareholding composition.
</P>
<P>
Although the actual equity holding was still being looked
into, the government would retain a number of shares and a
provision would be extended to the staff, cotton producers, the
national investment trust and the public to acquire shares in the
company.

<HEADLINE> Jinggangshan to Add New Tourist Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A large comprehensive
agricultural development project combining tourism and ecological
agriculture is to be launched in Jinggangshan City, east China's
Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Located in the southwestern part of Jiangxi Province,
Jinggangshan City was once a Chinese revolutionary base, and is
now placed high up among the 40 best tourist cities in China.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the implementation of the project will add
a new scenic spot to Jinggangshan.
</P>
<P>
The city now receives more than one million tourists each
year. Following the opening of the Beijing-Shenzhen (Kowloon),
Jinggangshan Airport and upgrading of 319 National Highway,
Jinggangshan City is listed as one of the state's first-class open
cities, and has bright prospects for developing tourism.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the project will be carried out
in three stages within eight years in the city's Nashan Basin. The
area covers 48 square kilometers, and is considered an ideal place
for developing tourism-oriented ecological agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Workers will mainly use funds for comprehensive agricultural
development and high technology, and will build nine allied
projects in the basin, including five exemplary production zones
involving capital construction for farmland featuring "three
highs" (high yield, high efficiency and high quality), forest and
fruits, vegetables growing, animal husbandry and aquatic products
breeding. There will also be two gardens for rare plants and
flower pots.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase construction, which will focus on basic
facilities and scientific and technological experimental models,
will require an investment of 3.77 million yuan, and will be
completed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that when finished, the project will be able to
generate 140 million yuan each year, equivalent to the city's
current total revenue over three years.

XI'AN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese woman farmer, Niu
Yuqin, hailed as a champion in combating the spread of the
country's deserts, has been honored again at the headquarters of
the United Nations in New York.
</P>
<P>
Niu was invited to attend and deliver a speech at the ninth
conference at a UN Convention for Combating Desertification. Niu
was the only farmer representative at the New York conference.
</P>
<P>
Niu, from northwest China's Shaanxi province, and her family,
have been fighting desertification for the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
She continued the family's efforts, even after her sick husband
died. Niu and her family have afforested 20,000 mu (1,300
hectares) of land. She was honored as a national role model, and
one of the ten outstanding women across the country.
</P>
<P>
Niu's next plan was to reclaim a piece of demonstration land
using an ecologic agriculture system in her home village.
</P>
<P>
Two out of every five people in the world directly threatened
by desertification live in China. The desertified area in the
country accounts for one third of its total. The desert areas
are growing by 2,100 square kilometers each year.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from 1978, China started construction of a "three
north" shelter belt project across northwest, north and northeast
China, in an attempt to ward off the problem.
</P>
<P>
Since then, China has afforested 16.63 million ha of land in
those regions, which has provided protection for 11 million
hectares of farmland.

<HEADLINE> Protection on Tropical Forest, Rare Animals in Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 200,000 hectares of
tropical primeval forest in the southernmost Hainan province and
Xishuangbanna in Yunnan province are under protection, thanks to a
series of measures for safeguarding tropical forests.
</P>
<P>
A group of rare plants, including vatice hainanensis and
homalium hainanensis, have been found in mountainous areas in
Hainan.
</P>
<P>
China's tropical forests have been seriously damaged by
excessive tree felling. Since the 1950s an annual 100,000 cubic
meters of timber were transported to other parts of the country,
with the total acreage of tropical forest on Hainan Island
dropping by over 70,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Ecologists said that this has made the province to suffer more
from flooding and desertification. This year Hainan suffered an
economic loss of four billion yuan caused by stormy rains.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has taken a series of measures to
protect its tropical forest resources since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
A nature reserve, covering more than 150,000 hectares, has been
set up in south Hainan's mountainous areas and Yunnan's
Xishuangbanna area, and some 100 million yuan has been used to
fence mountains for tree-planting.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the government called a halt on the cutting of
tropical forest on Hainan Island, and allocated more than 30
million yuan to former lumber-men to encourage them to plant
trees, protect forests and conduct agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Plant gardens, an ecological research institute, and wild
animal protection stations have also been established to protect
rare species.
</P>
<P>
There are 4,000 kinds of higher plants in Hainan's forest area,
over 600 are unique to Hainan.
</P>
<P>
The region is also a base for cultivating rice and litchi, and
seeds of over 280 kinds of agricultural crops, fruits and
vegetables have also been found in the region.
</P>
<P>
More efforts are being made to protect animal resources in
Hainan, which has set up 19 wild animal protection zones.
</P>
<P>
A number of international and regional organizations also pay
close attention to tropical forest protection in Hainan.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Syria Trade Verbal Accusations Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel has renewed its
charge that Syria is preparing war in view of the stalled peace
process, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier General Amos Gilad, head of research at the military
intelligence, was quoted as saying Tuesday that Syria might attack
Israel if it concludes that there is no peaceful way to regain the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Gilad gold the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee
that "the Syrians are talking about a military option, are
preparing for it."
</P>
<P>
"If we reach a dead end in the diplomatic process (Syrian
President Hafez) Assad's conclusion will be to use a military
move while exploiting the element of surprise for a diplomatic
gain," he told the members of the Knesset (MK).
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Syrian capital, Damascus Radio
Tuesday accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of acting
against peace and of massing more troops in south Lebanon
and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The state-run radio said Israel wanted Arabs to submit to
Israeli demands and to abandon their lands, adding that
Damascus would not change its conditions for peace. "It is
clear that Israel is in a dilemma due to the policy of its
hard-line leaders, who adopted everything which is against peace,"
the radio said in a political commentary.
</P>
<P>
The radio charged that Israel's defense minister is also
continuing his provocative statements against Syria. It declared
that the Arab World will never accept "Israel's expansionist
policies and its security pretexts."
</P>
<P>
The rise of mutual accusations came against the backdrop of
mounting tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbors as a
result of the new Israeli government's deviation from the widely
accepted principle of land for peace.

<HEADLINE> Dial-A-Luxury Service for Chinese Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- More and more wealthy farmers in
China are using dial-a-goods services to equip their homes with
the latest luxuries.
</P>
<P>
It saves them the time and trouble of making long journeys from
their rural homes to big department stores in cities.
</P>
<P>
Large screen TVs, refrigerators, and other expensive gadgets
are delivered to their doorsteps.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, more and more farmers have become
wealthy. The Industrial Products Sales Company in Rizhao city,
east China's Shandong province, sold 10,500 cars to farmers in the
first half of this year. In the whole of last year the company
sold just 800 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A leading electrical appliance store in Zaozhuang city
witnessed its sales volumes of domestically-made refrigerators,
color TV sets, and air conditioners in rural areas all increase by
over 80 percent in the first six months this year.
</P>
<P>
Among Shandong province's rural supply and cooperative system,
commodities sold by telephone ordering from home have reached 3.2
billion yuan, accounting for one-third of the total retail sales.
</P>
<P>
In the past farmers usually bought goods at rural outdoor
markets, urban department stores or shops in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
But they could only buy small commodities in those outlets, and
it was more difficult for farmers to buy larger goods from urban
areas, which are far away from their homes.
</P>
<P>
By telephone ordering, the farmers who live far away from
cities can buy large-sized durable goods, and importantly, can
enjoy a series of services from quality guarantees, free delivery
and installation, and permanent maintenance.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Doctor Consultation System Opens in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China's first satellite doctor
consultation system has become operational in Shanghai Huashan
Hospital with the help of a multi-media computer network.
</P>
<P>
Utilizing "Asia-Pacific 1" telecommunications satellite,
Shanghai doctors can now make a "face to face" diagnosis of
patients thousands of kilometers away, and provide treatment plans
for local doctors through the new satellite ground system.
</P>
<P>
The system is jointly run by Huashan Hospital and Shanghai
Science and Technology Investment Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai doctors can get patients' case histories, X-rays, scan
reports, and other medical material. They can even have a visual
consultation with patients before making a correct diagnosis and
effective treatment plan.
</P>
<P>
Huashan Hospital is one of the best hospitals in China's
leading industrial city and financial center, with 250 medical
experts on its staff.
</P>
<P>
Remote medical treatment is a new diagnosis trend in
international medical circles. Doctors in remote areas can get
advice on diagnosis, treatment and surgical techniques from
doctors in major cities, especially when meeting patients with
difficult and complicated diseases.
</P>
<P>
Now the country's most advanced remote diagnosis center has
established several branches in other provinces, and is connected
with an international remote medical treatment network. It means
doctors in Shanghai can also have medical consultations with their
foreign colleagues.

JAKARTA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- senior officials of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are scheduled to
meet in Bali, Indonesia, next week to discuss the development and
utilization of industrial minerals in the region.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of the meeting are the establishment of an
ASEAN minerals database and exchange of information on minerals
and environmental legislation policies and regulations, the
Organizing Committee of the ASEAN Secretariat said here today.
</P>
<P>
Action programs for 1996 to 1998 and mechanisms for the
formulation and implementation of cooperation programs will also
be discussed at the meeting, which well be held from October 22 to
24.
</P>
<P>
Discussions will also cover national priorities and policies
for the development and utilization of mineral resources and legal
aspects of foreign investment in the mining sector.
</P>
<P>
Previous ASEAN working party discussions on minerals
cooperation drew the conclusion that each ASEAN government needed
to make clear and attractive regulations and procedures to
increase investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN cooperation in mineral development began 15 years ago but
progress has not been as fast as expected because of the lack of
authority given to senior officials in charge of minerals, the
committee said.

<P>
WELLINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand National
Party has been urged to take the initiative to form the government
after the October 12 election in which there is no clear winner.
</P>
<P>
Richard Prebble, leader of the ACT NZ party, suggested today
that caretaker Prime Minister Jim Bolger go to the Governor
General to ask for the chance of forming a minority government.
</P>
<P>
This will immediately test National Party's support in
parliament and force New Zealand First, a party now holding the
key in forming a coalition, to declare its hand.
</P>
<P>
Prebble, a declared supporter of the National, said Bolger is
clearly prepared to consider the position of New Zealand First,
but he should not let that drag on into instability.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand First leader Winston Peters has called for patience
for the bargain process, and indicated that the negotiation on
forming a coalition could take at least one month.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, United Party leader Peter Dunne also said
Bolger should declare his intention to continue governing and then
test support in parliament as soon as special votes in the
election are counted.
</P>
<P>
This will call NZ First's bluff and force it to take a stand,
said Dunne, who is now minister of internal affairs in the
caretaker government.

DHAKA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) after
days of sharp decline has been bounced back with all share price
index rising by 103 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Following the publication of the warning notice by the
Securities and Exchange Commission on October 8 and the
introduction of circuit breaker on October 12 to contain the
unprecedented surge, the share price index declined 294 points
during the last six days of trading.
</P>
<P>
But the situation changed altogether Tuesday, DSE officials
confirmed, explaining that the all share price index gained more
than 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
A total of 290,267 shares were transacted with a sum of TK
70.65 million (about 1.68 million US dollars) compared with the
133,600 shares valued at TK 40 million (less than one million
dollars) on October 8.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-seven issues were traded, out of which 84 gained, 2 lost
and one remained unchanged while market capitalization stood at
134.05 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, there was a poor trading in the day since investors
decided to hold back their shares. Buyers were interested to buy
even at the highest price allowable under the "circuit breaker".
But sellers were not ready to sell.
</P>
<P>
Analysts maintained that the market would regain its normal
strength soon after practicing several high-range price
fluctuations as abnormal market trends require abnormal market
correction drives.

<HEADLINE> India's Industrial Slowdown Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- India continues to witness a
slump in its industrial production, whose growth rate has gone
down sharply during the current fiscal year compared with last
year, further aggravating concerns over an impending economic
recession.
</P>
<P>
According to data released by the Ministry of Industry on
Tuesday, the slump is particularly sharp in the infrastructure
sector, which is crucial to overall industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four industries, which have a weight of 50.37 percent in
the index of industrial production, have registered a growth rate
of 5.6 percent during the period between April and August this
year, compared with 12.6 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of infrastructure industries also slid to 3.5
percent, from 11.7 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The electricity sector, for example, obtained a growth rate of
2.4 percent during the period under consideration, down from 11.7
percent during the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Crude petroleum even showed a negative growth rate of 10.4
percent, a sharp decline from the 19-percent increase achieved a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate in the production of cars also fell to 21.6
percent, from 33.1 percent during the previous corresponding
period.
</P>
<P>
Economists here attributed the industrial slowdown to slow
decision-making in the government, which has led to an inventory
pileup of industrial products and high interest rates which have
worsened the financial situation of the industries.

other's educational diplomas, he added.
</P>
<P>
Political and economic relations between the two countries had
developed rapidly since Hungary recognized Slovenia, a former

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebel
organization, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), is to
be banned soon by the Sri Lankan government, according to informed
sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The proscription which will be gazetted under Emergency
Regulations will identify the LTTE as a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that maintaining membership in the
organization, supporting it, appearing on behalf of it or
withholding information about it will be offenses punishable by
law.
</P>
<P>
The United States of America has reportedly classified the LTTE
as being among eight of the world's most heinous, inhuman, wicked
and disgusting terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, an armed Tamil group against the government, has been
fighting a 13-year guerrilla war for a separate state in the north
and east of the country. More than 55,000 people have reportedly
been killed in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Already LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and nine other
members of the leadership were indicted in Colombo's High Court
Monday on 712 charges of conspiracy to blow up the Central Bank of
Sri Lanka and for having killed more 100 persons in a bombing  on
January 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
The proscription of the LTTE is expected to add clout to Sri
Lanka's appeal to Western countries to prevent the LTTE from fund
raising, close down its offices and deport its members from those
countries, the sources added.

3,290. The figure is based on reports from five major hospitals in
the capital alone.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government said on Tuesday that it had requested the
Delhi government to treat the outbreak of dengue fever as an
epidemic and take urgent remedial measures.
</P>
<P>
But Delhi State Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the same day
that it was too early to call it an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, he also
categorically denied that the World Health Organization (WHO) had
ever warned the government of the impending outbreak of dengue.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the denial in response to an earlier
statement by the WHO Southeast Asia Regional Office here that it
had repeatedly sent warnings on the dengue outbreak to the Delhi
health authorities but the warnings had been ignored.
</P>
<P>
Vardhan argued that "it is not an epidemic if we go by the
percentage of the total population affected by the disease."
</P>
<P>
In a self-initiated hearing on the capital's dengue-malaria
infection on Tuesday, the Delhi High Court urged the city
government to forget about saving "face" in asking for help to
control the spread of the diseases.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Accuses Muslims of Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serb
member of the presidency of the Republic of Bosnia, said today
that he will work for establishing Bosnia's state institutions.
</P>
<P>
The proposed state institutions would tally with interests of
the Republic of Serbia and Bosnian Serbs, he said. Krajisnik
recently met John Kornblum, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
European Affairs, and Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The international community had grasped that Muslims rather
than Serbs had boycotted the establishment of the proposed
institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims, boycotting the establishment, intended to continue
to press for the right to represent the whole nation, Krajisnik
said. He said he had tried unsuccessfully to talk with Alija
Izetbegovic, chairman and Muslim member of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia's newly-elected presidency was inaugurated in Sarajevo
last Saturday, in the absence of Serb deputies who refused to
attend the ceremony "due to security concerns."
</P>
<P>
The new presidency is dominated by the Muslim Democratic Action
Party, the Croatian Democratic Action Party and the Serb
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Serbs were showing their dissatisfaction with
a joint declaration signed in Paris by Bosnian Muslim President
Izetbegovic and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony, Izetbegovic, President of the Croatian-Muslim
Federation Kresimir Zubak and 31 Muslim and Croatian deputies
signed the declaration, promising to safeguard the Bosnian
constitution and protect the interests and equality of the three
ethnic groups.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- India's most populous state
Uttar Pradesh appears to be heading towards a constitutional
crisis with the stalemate continuing over the formation of a state
government.
</P>
<P>
The crisis loomed larger as the Steering Committee of the
ruling United Front Tuesday rejected an appeal by Congress party
President Sitaram Kesri to unconditionally support Mayawati of the
Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) as the joint candidate for the post of
chief minister.
</P>
<P>
The recent assembly elections in the state resulted in a hung
assembly with all three major political forces in the state
falling short of a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
Of the 419 state assembly seats contested, the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) bagged 174, followed by the United Front with 133. The
Congress-BSP alliance got only 99.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party has been trying to get the United Front to
support BSP chief Mayawati for the post of chief minister,
reminding the front that the Congress party offered outside
support for it in forming the central government.
</P>
<P>
With the political stalemate unresolved, former prime minister
V.P. Singh has called for presidential rule in the state.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Appeals to Nation for Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba today appealed to all sectors concerned in the
country to face the food security challenge confronting the
nation.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the occasion of the World Food Day today, Deuba
said that this year's theme of the World Food Day, which calls for
the increase of food production and elimination of hunger and
malnutrition, carries special importance for Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Nepal should assess the efforts it had made in the past for
food security on this occasion and invigorate future efforts by
properly mobilizing the country's limited resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the country's efforts have failed to bring
desired results due to the high population pressure, efforts have
to be made for more productive and commercial agricultural
activities along with a balanced program for population control,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Deuba also stressed the need for providing employment and
launching income generation programs for the poor with a view to
ensuring availability of food for all the people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nepal, a net food exporter in the 1980s, had to import food
grains in recent years mainly due to its rapidly growing
population that goes up at an annual rate of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said they expected the country's food deficit to
exceed 250,000 tons by the year 2002.

<HEADLINE> Floodwater from North Expected to Hit Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The first wave of floodwater
from the north of Thailand in the Chao Phraya river is expected to
reach Bangkok today, likely to cause further overflowing,
according to Bangkok authorities.
</P>
<P>
Runoff from the north, when meeting with peak sea tides from
the south today, is expected to push the water level up in the
river to between 2.11 and 2.14 meters above mean sea level.
</P>
<P>
The speed of the runoff will increase to 4,000 cubic meters per
second from 3,800 Tuesday, when the peak river water level reached
1.93 meters, 13 centimeters above the level at which a large area
of Bangkok will be flooded.
</P>
<P>
The surge today is feared to cause further overflowing,
aggravating the situation in areas already submerged and flooding
other parts of the city, in particular areas along and near the
western bank of the Chao Phraya river.
</P>
<P>
Runoff from the north has already inundated several provinces
for several days north of Bangkok, including Sing Buri, Ang Thong
and Ayutthaya. In low-lying urban areas in these provinces, water
level is near the ceilings.
</P>
<P>
On October 28 last year, the Chao Phraya river water reached
the record high of 2.22 meters, causing temporary flooding to the
area where the famous Grand Palace is situated.

<HEADLINE> Lumbermen Face Jobs Axe in Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 8,000 lumbermen in
southernmost Hainan Province have turned to other kinds of jobs,
after their tree-felling jobs were axed.
</P>
<P>
It follows a local policy to protect forests by completely
closing down its lumbering industry, a move started in January
1994.
</P>
<P>
The decision, designed to protect valuable tropical trees, has
affected three forestry administrations and 11 three-cutting units
in the island province. The policy has led to some 24,000
lumbermen becoming jobless.
</P>
<P>
To combat the measures, the forestry enterprises have taken
various steps to help former lumbermen and their families to start
new lives.
</P>
<P>
Some hospitals and schools attached to forestry administrations
have been closed or annexed to counterparts run by localities,
while their pension-holders have joined a local security system
set up for aged people.
</P>
<P>
A number of enterprises and plantations have been founded by
the administrations to employ former tree-cutters, and many former
lumbermen have found new jobs in other factories, or have opened
their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
Although the province has stopped producing lumber, a
1,000-strong team of forest rangers are still patroling everyday
in the forests.
</P>
<P>
According to local experts, if the protective efforts go on for
another 20 or 30 years, local forests are expected to be restored,
but it will take another 200 years for the complete restoration of
the primitive forests that have been destroyed in the previous
decades, especially between the 1960s-80s.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Draft Law on Personal Income Tax Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's first law on personal
income tax, if passed by the National Assembly, will take effect
as of early 1998, replacing the present ordinance on high-income
tax.
</P>
<P>
The draft law has been completed and is scheduled to be
submitted to the National Assembly which opened Tuesday, said a
Finance Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
The draft tax rates are based on annual income, rather than
monthly incomes as at present, but monthly payments would still be
required.
</P>
<P>
The tax rates for regular incomes would not be altered - from
zero to 60 percent for Vietnamese citizens, and a 30 percent
surtax would be abolished.
</P>
<P>
For foreigners, the range of the new tax rates would be from
zero to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new income tax law would help to abolish conflict in the
present income tax regulations, particularly the differences
between Vietnamese and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
According to tax experts, the present rates of income tax for
Vietnamese citizens are too high. The rate is 60 percent for an
eight million dong (about 727 dollars) monthly income, with the
30 percent surtax imposed on any earnings of more than five
million dong (about 455 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Under the new draft law, the rate of 60 percent would only
apply to an annual income of over 180 million dong (about 16,364
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The big difference between the income tax for foreigners and
Vietnamese has had a negative impact upon Vietnamese employees,
particularly in foreign invested companies.
</P>
<P>
If an employer hires a Vietnamese worker at a salary of 2,000
dollars per month, he will have to pay a total annual charge of
100,000 dollars (including tax and social welfare payments),
making the cost of a Vietnamese worker much higher than that of a
foreigner.
</P>
<P>
Many companies have avoided paying income tax for their
employees by registering low salaries for them with added payment
made to the employees in other forms.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign companies said they had changed their decisions to
invest in Vietnam because of the large expenditure in employing
workers.

ROME, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi said today he expected his country to become India's
biggest European trading partner.
</P>
<P>
Prodi made these remarks during talks with visiting Indian
President Shankar Dayal Sharma this evening, according to a
government communique.
</P>
<P>
The communique showed that trade volume between the two

</P>
<P>
In order to strengthen their economic ties, the premier called

cooperation with their Indian partners.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed international issues of common
concern and pledged to cooperate in the reform of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro held talks
with Sharma and promised that Italy would continue to try to bring
India and the European Union closer.
</P>

Wuhan used to be the country's second largest financial center
following Shanghai, before it was overtaken by other cities. There
were more than 60 domestic banks and 20 foreign banks in 1948.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Wuhan has made much headway in the financial
sector and has developed a very active financial market.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the city had set up more than 2,000
financial institutions, with an annual financing turnover of 31.8
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
So far the city has issued securities of various kinds worth
18.2 billion yuan, with 66 securities dealers involved.
</P>
<P>
With a strong economy in central China, Wuhan generated 60
billion yuan in gross domestic product in 1995. Up to now, the
city has introduced three billion US dollars in overseas funds,
ranking first among all inland cities in this regard.
</P>
<P>
According to city officials, Wuhan is encouraging commercial
banks and other banking institutions to open more branches.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to turn into a center on financing, property
trade and banking business in the coming five years, they said.

<P>
LIANYUNGANG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Contracts for 62
foreign-funded projects have been signed at a trade fair jointly
organized by the Republic of Korea (ROK) and this coastal city in
east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The projects will attract a total investment of 279 million US
dollars, said Zhang Lianyun, director of the Lianyungang Economic
Development Zone, at the closing ceremony held in Lianyungang on

</P>
<P>
Nine projects each involved an investment of 10 million US
dollars. They cover the fields of communication, chemistry,
textiles, machinery, environmental protection and foodstuffs.

<P>
Ten ROK-invested enterprises were built in the development zone
in the first half of this year, bringing the total to 20. An
industrial park with investment from ROK will soon be built in the
zone.
</P>
<P>
As the starting point of the New Euro-Asia Continental Bridge,
Lianyungang was one of the first group of coastal cities to open
to overseas investors. It was considered an ideal place for ROK
investors for its proximity and good investment environment.
</P>
<P>
China has become the third largest trade partner with ROK since
the two sides established diplomatic relations in 1992. Trade
volume between the two countries is expected to reach 22 billion
US dollars by the end of this year.

PRAGUE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Slovak government today
decided to set up an export fund to cope with a mounting trade
deficit.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be used to promote Slovak-made products abroad,

BANGKOK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from
developing members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have
rejected a trade and environment report at a WTO meeting in
Geneva, saying that it ignored demands from developing nations,
local newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
Thai Commerce Ministry officials described the report as
"unbalanced" and too much to the advantage of developed nations.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by a committee under the WTO, calls for
trade measures against WTO members who fail to achieve specific
environmental objectives, the officials were quoted as saying by
the local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
They said that it did not mention demands from developing
countries for greater market access while ignoring comments of
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
They stressed that the report, to be submitted to the first WTO
ministerial meeting in Singapore in December, should be prepared
by the WTO Secretariat instead of the committee.
</P>
<P>
According to the local newspapers, officials from WTO members
are still negotiating the report, which is expected to be
completed later this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese home province of
Confucius has brought in new rules to help regulate its growing
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
East China's Shandong Province has issued a set of regulations
on tourism, becoming the third in the country to publish such
laws, following Hainan and Henan provinces.
</P>
<P>
Li Qingde, director of the provincial tourism administration,
said at a news briefing that the law is aimed at providing
legal protection for local administrative work on tourism.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, with its tourism industry booming in recent years,
has become a major tourist designation in China.
</P>
<P>
The province has a large number of historic and cultural
relics, and it is home to many famous figures, including Confucius
and Mencius.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the province, where there are
240 travel agencies and 100 star-rated hotels, received 450,000
overseas tourists who brought in 154 million US dollars, while in
the same year over 46 million domestic travelers toured the
province.
</P>
<P>
The development of local tourism industry has been hampered by
a lack of related rules, which has made it difficult for local
tourism administrative bodies to carry out their duties.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Giant masts can be seen now and
then through dense beachside trees as the bus we are riding is
approaching Bangladesh's port city of Chittagong by the Bay of
Bengal.
</P>
<P>
An ideal vacation spot with picturesque hinterland of
hill-forests and lakes, Chittagong is the main site for the
country's heavy and light industries including its sole steel mill
and oil refinery.
</P>
<P>
But Bangladeshis regard Chittagong mainly as a sea port which
handles 70 percent of the country's foreign trade goods.
</P>
<P>
Container handling at the port has grown at an average rate of
19 percent annually during the past decade, a port official said.
A total of 1,286 ships were handled in the Chittagong Port during
the last fiscal ending June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has signed agreements with 12 countries for
bilateral cooperation in shipping and ratified 11 conventions of
the International Maritime Organization (IMO). As the country's
only international sea port, Chittagong has been playing a very
important role in the field.
</P>
<P>
The commercial capital of Bangladesh is also known for its
export processing zone (EPZ). Like another EPZ in Dhaka, the
Chittagong EPZ has contributed much to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings from the units, which are mainly
export-oriented garment factories, located in the EPZs are
estimated at 500 million US dollars, 11 percent of the country's
total export earnings during this fiscal beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that South Korea plans to invest one billion
dollars in a new EPZ in Chittagong to set up 100 small and
medium-sized units as well as 30 large industries, which will
create job opportunities for 150,000 Bangladeshis.
</P>
<P>
Chittagong also has great potential for tourism industry. Its
green hills and forests, broad sandy beaches, fine cool climate
and the hum of a restless seaport with the pleasure of a charming
hill-town with its undulating topography always attract holiday
makers.
</P>
<P>
It is connected with Cox's Bazar, the tourist capital of the
country, both by road and air. Cox's Bazar, about 170 kilometers
to the south of Chittagong, has the world's longest unbroken beach
(120 km) sloping gently down to the blue waters of the Bay of
Bengal against the picturesque background of a chain of hills
covered with deep green forests.

<TEXT>
<P>
However, infrastructure in Chittagong is not worthy of the
commercial capital. Although it is connected with Dhaka, capital
of Bangladesh, by rail, road, air and water, its connections with
the outside world are limited due to poor transport and other
facilities.
</P>
<P>
"It takes us about 7-10 hours to drive more than 400 kilometers
 from Chittagong to Dhaka or 4 hours to drive 170 kilometers to
Cox's Bazar. The road is so bad that they are full of bumps and
hollows," bus drivers complain.
</P>
<P>
According to concerned authorities, though 40 percent of the
country's foreign trade commodities should be transported by its
own ship, at present only 9 percent is being transported by
Bangladesh flag carrier ships.
</P>
<P>
The situation has attracted the attention of the new government
of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina which has taken up a master plan
to expand and modernize the Chittagong Port.
</P>
<P>
The process of constructing a container terminal and installing
modern equipment at a cost of about TK 10 billion (about 238
million US dollars) and of procuring five ships including a mother
tanker has started to cope with the increasing pressure on the
port, Shipping Minister A.S.M. Abdur Rab confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund has
decided to provide a loan for Chittagong airport development
project to expand and improve the existing facilities there to
facilitate foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that a TK one billion (about 23.8 million
dollars) recreation-cum-tourist center will also be built at the
Patenga Sea Beach in the city, which will include a children's
park, golf club, swimming pool, residential hotel, trade center
and open restaurant.
</P>
<P>
"You see, the road is being repaired or newly built. I'm sure
it will not take a long time to change the face of the port city,"
a Bangladeshi friend told this correspondent while riding a bus on
way back to Chittagong from Cox's Bazar.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Bangladesh is paying more attention to drawing foreign
investments in its efforts to alleviate poverty and catch up with
the outside world. As the gateway to the outside world, Chittagong
will surely play an increasingly important role in this respect.

<P>
KIEV, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The development of state-run
enterprises, cutting unemployment and improving social security
will be key priorities for the Ukrainian government next year,
Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko said today.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the government's program for 1997 to parliament, he
said the government would cut taxes, work out a new tax system and
try to boost industrial production next year.
</P>
<P>
The country will also impose tariff barriers to imports in
certain areas, including plane-making, internal-combustion engine
and combine harvester manufacturing, he told a meeting of the
Supreme Soviet.
</P>
<P>
The government has come up with a plan to tap the nation's
export potential and has created practical conditions for
attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The country will receive some 900 million U.S. dollars in
foreign assistance in 1997 to develop its mineral and energy
industries, Lazarenko said.
</P>
<P>
On currency reform, the prime minister said progress had been
made in 1996 and in 1997 the government will maintain the
stability of its new currency, the hryvna, and encourage banks to
provide enterprises with long-term loans.
</P>
<P>
On social security, Lazarenko said the government will take
effective measures to eliminate unemployment and to help those
citizens who need social security.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian parliament provisionally adopted the 1997 program
after intense debate, but has sent it back to the government for
fine-tuning and asked that it be re-submitted to parliament by
December 1 this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Achieve Success in Radiation Disease Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medical experts have
made important an breakthrough in preventing and curing diseases
caused by exposure to harmful radiation.
</P>
<P>
One patient in China, who is a farmer named He Zhigen, has
already been successfully treated, using a combination of
Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western medicine, according to
experts at the 31st International Conference on Military
Medicine. The conference is still being held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts have discovered how nuclear radiation damages
the body's blood forming system, microcirculation and other human
organs.
</P>
<P>
Methods for diagnosing the early stages of acute radiation
diseases have been developed, as well as standards for clinical
diagnosis of the diseases.
</P>
<P>
Chinese military medical experts have conducted long-term
research of injuries caused by nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
By researching patients who suffered from radiation poisoning
in nuclear accidents, Chinese experts have selected a group of
anti-radiation medicines for treatment of acute radiation diseases.
</P>
<P>
They have performed stomach surgery on a patient who was
exposed to harmful radiation, but was treated 24 days later. It
was the first surgery in the world ever performed on a radiation
patient.
</P>
<P>
Another patient who suffered from serious radiation was cured
by taking traditional Chinese medicines and Western medicines.
</P>
<P>
The patient, whose blood forming function was damaged, was said
to be the first such patient in the world who, after treatment,
had none of the usual adverse reactions associated with radiation
exposure, such as fever, infection and haemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being held for the first time in China since
the country joined the International Committee of Military
Medicine in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Military officers and doctors from at least 100 countries are
attending the seven-day conference, which opened on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Some 485 papers and 40 reports on military medicine, including
burns and other wound treatment, and injuries caused by military
training, have been submitted.
</P>
<P>
Topics for discussion also include prevention and treatment of
diseases caused by viruses and AIDS from a military point of
view.

<HEADLINE> Curing Soil and Water Erosion in Loess Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China has taken effective
measures to help cure the country's most severe soil and water
erosion trouble spot.
</P>
<P>
It has brought 150,000 square kilometers of erosion-stricken
area across the Loess Plateau under control.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 430,000 square kilometers, out of the total 620,000
square kilometers of the plateau suffer from severe water and soil
erosion, which has aroused international attention.
</P>
<P>
Enriched with experience in soil erosion harnessing in small
valley areas divided by rivers, China has set out on the road of
conserving water and soil in affected county areas throughout the
plateau.
</P>
<P>
Jingchuan and Changwu counties in northwest China's Gansu and
Shaanxi Provinces, both among the country's first group of pilot
counties for comprehensive harnessing of soil erosion, have
achieved successful results.
</P>
<P>
Jingchuan has invested nearly 80 million yuan in the project,
allowing more than 44,700 hectares of terraced fields and
17,000-ha of orchards to be used.
</P>
<P>
More than 82 percent of areas stricken by soil erosion in
Jingchuan has been brought under control, and forest coverage rate
has seen a rise, helping increase the net income of local farmers.
</P>
<P>
The positive attitude of the local farmers towards the
harnessing projects has helped Changwu county lift its annual
agricultural output value from nearly 96 million yuan in 1990 to
the current 270 million yuan. Now 77 percent of the local farm
products are on sale, compared with the previous level of 34
percent.
</P>
<P>
Successful experiences of the two counties are expected to be
introduced to the whole country, so as to help ease one of the
world's major erosion problems.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Attracts Investors for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial powerhouse
Liaoning Province is set to receive millions of US dollars in
overseas investment for its burgeoning rural economy, "China
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Investors from Europe, America and Asia promised in Beijing
yesterday to fork out 42.12 million U.S. dollars for 20 projects
in the province, ranging from agro-machinery to animal feed. Local
Chinese partners will invest another 30 million U.S. dollars to
bring the total committed input to nearly 75 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Deputy governor Xu Wencai said during an investment seminar
that these contracts signaled a new start for Liaoning, which has
since 1949 spear-headed the nation's heavy industry (often at the
expense of agricultural input) to fully tap its long-neglected
agricultural advantages.
</P>
<P>
The governor estimated contractual overseas investment in
Liaoning' agriculture at 900 million U.S. dollars at the end of
this year, a record high.
</P>
<P>
Britain's ABN company yesterday signed a letter of intent to
build China's largest singe animal feed factory in Liaoning with
an initial annual output of 850,000 tons. A formal contract under
which ABN holds a majority stake is expected to be signed early
next year.
</P>
<P>
Harry Pickavance, ABN regional manager in China, said his
company hopes to become one of the top three animal feed
manufacturers in China in three years' time.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 40 million, Liaoning is one of the
provinces with the highest grain yield per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The province's grain output this year will be 16 million tons,
sufficient for the population, according to a local official in
charge of rural economy. The target for the year 2000 is 17.5
million tons, still enough after adjustment for population and
animal husbandry growth.
</P>
<P>
Half of the population in Liaoning are urban residents who have
turned out to be deep-pocket consumers of farm produce. The large
urban population is a result of industrialization in the province
under the erstwhile planned economy.
</P>
<P>
Israel has contacted Dandong of the province for possibility of
launching a joint venture in strawberry production.
</P>
<P>
Standard Group (Banking), the largest bank in Spain, yesterday
said that it was interested in providing financial support for
Liaoning's projects.
</P>
<P>
Danish commercial counsellor Steven Foster said that his
country would like to increase investment in meat processing,
dairy products, food ingredients, shipping and services in
Liaoning and the rest of China.

<HEADLINE> State of Alert Remains as Rain Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Permanent Emergency
Committee (COPECO) of Honduras decided today that the state of
alert remains as heavy rains continue to fall, reports
from the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa said.
</P>
<P>
The alert was sounded last week after the Chamelecon and Ulua
rivers, which flow from the northwest of Honduras and empty into
the Atlantic Ocean, rose.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Aldana, a member of the COPECO, said flooding in the
eastern department of Olancho had led to five unconfirmed deaths.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the heavy rains, a tropical depression was
moving towards its Caribbean coast.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rainfalls are expected in the country during the next 24
hours because of the low-pressure system.
</P>
<P>
Efren Reyes, a member of the Weather Forecasting Bureau, said
the tropical depression, which was located at 16.1 degrees
latitude north and 83 longitude west, some 172 kilometers
southeast of the Cisne Islands in the Caribbean Sea, would become
"Hurricane Lily" if it gained strength.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Hungary Enhance Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The defense ministers of Ukraine
and Hungary said here today that military cooperation between the
two countries is ready to move onto a practical level.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference today, Ukrainian Defense Minister
Alexander Kuzmuk said that he had discussed with his Hungarian
counterpart, Gyorgy Keleti, issues such as joint military
exercises, exchange of military personnel between military
institutions, and ways to improve the quality of officers.
</P>
<P>
He also offered Ukrainian help to Hungary to maintain and
reconstruct military facilities and proposed that the two
countries jointly use military bases.
</P>
<P>
Keleti, who arrived here earlier today for a two-day official
visit to Ukraine, proposed the two countries sign an agreement on
enhancing military understanding, similar to an agreement Hungary
has already signed with Romania.
</P>
<P>
He said Hungary hopes to strengthen military cooperation with
Ukraine and that improving bilateral relations is important.

<HEADLINE> Rich Source of Energy in Rural China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Fore generations, rural
residents used animal droppings and organic waste to heat their
homes and feed their cooking fires.
</P>
<P>
Today, farmers still use animal wastes as fuel, but in a far
more modern and less smelly way, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
They generate fuel for cooking, heating and lighting in
backyard methane-processing pits.
</P>
<P>
The practice is one of several strides China has made in
developing new uses for methane, a senior agriculture official is
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
China is becoming a leader in developing and applying uses for
methane gas and intends to continue discovering, improving and
expanding those uses for agricultural development, a senior
agriculture official added.
</P>
<P>
Methane, a clean gas generated by the fermentation of organic
waste, such as animal droppings and straw, was the focus of a
meeting in Huairou County in Beijing yesterday.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks, Vice-Minister of Agriculture Hong
Fuzeng told the Fifth National Conference of the Chinese Methane
Society that last year 5.7 million rural households owned
methane-generating pits, and 25 million rural residents had access
to quality methane for cooking, heating and lighting.
</P>
<P>
Hong said that the methane projects were crucial to China's
development because more than 75 percent of the population lives
in rural areas, and natural resources are limited.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, the Ministry of Agriculture plans to
accelerate the construction of energy-saving and pollution-free
projects, with methane as the core, to promote the sustainable
growth of agriculture and related enterprises, Hong said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for changes in regulations and policies to
promote the use of methane.

<HEADLINE> Food Summit to Produce New Plan to Reduce World Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A new plan to reduce world
hunger will be produced by the food summit to be convened next
month in Rome, Italy, a senior organizer of the meeting said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"More than 800 million people throughout the world, particularly
in developing countries, do not have enough food to meet their
basic nutritional needs," said Kay Killingsworth,
secretary-general of the summit being organized by the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
Without action, she said, the proportion is expected to remain
the same when the global population hits 8.5 billion in 2030.
</P>
<P>
The Rome Declaration and the World Food Summit Plan of Action
which will be produced by the November 13-17 gathering will lay
the foundation for diverse paths to a common objective of food
security.
</P>
<P>
"Food security depends not only on agriculture but also on
policy in many other areas," she added.
</P>
<P>
Each nation must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources
and capacities to achieve its individual goals and co-operate
regionally and internationally in order to organize collective
solutions to global issues of food security.
</P>
<P>
Although food production has increased to match the rise in
global population since 1945, current grain shortages suggest a
future food crisis unless fish stocks are conserved, fertile
land protected and agricultural techniques improved.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 world leaders have been invited to the meeting and
about 100 have agreed to attend, Killingsworth said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Starts Drive to "Love Your Heart" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will start a municipal
drive focusing on heart disease prevention and control on
Saturday, "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
With its theme of "love your heart, protect your heart," the
drive is designed to raise pubic awareness about heart disease and
educate people about healthier lifestyles, said Wu Yonghao, deputy
chief for the office in charge of preliminary health care under
the Beijing Municipal Bureau.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, about 156 of every 100,000 male Beijingers
between the ages of 25-74 suffer from heart problems. The rate for
females is 74 of every 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Each year, about 27 percent of illness-related deaths in
Beijing are caused by heart diseases. High-blood pressure, one of
the major causes of heart problems, accounts for about 20 percent,
the highest in the country. Nationally, the average rate is 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that many Beijingers smoke cigarettes, drink alcoholic
beverages and consume too much salt.
</P>
<P>
A survey taken early this year shows that over 20 percent of
Beijing residents between the ages of 15 and 70 are cigarette
smokers.
</P>
<P>
When male residents between ages of 20 and 40 are considered,
the rate of smokers jumps to more than 60 percent compared with
around 3 percent for women.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming drive, which will be organized jointly by the
Beijing Municipal Health Bureau and Sino-US Joint Squibb
Pharmaceutical Ltd, will include free physical examinations,
publicity to educate people and consulting services.
</P>
<P>
To start the program, more than 300 health professionals
specializing in cerebral and cardiovascular illnesses from 40
major hospitals in the capital city will go into the streets to
provide free physical examinations and medical consultations for
local residents on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> One-Third of British Homes on Cable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one-third of British
homes are now connected to cable networks, said British science
and technology minister Ian Taylor today.
</P>
<P>
"We stand on the threshold of a new era in the development of
digital superhighway services," said Taylor at the opening
ceremony of European Cable Communication '96.
</P>
<P>
Over seven million of the 23 million British homes were now
connected to cable networks. By the year 2001, 60,000 miles
(96,000 kilometers) of cable would be in the ground, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The coming year will be a defining period for the sector. When
we meet again in a year's time, all the crucial strategic
decisions for the transition to digital services will have been
taken," he said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said the growth of the British cable industry would
create about 25,000 jobs over the next four years, concentrated in
areas where unemployment had traditionally been prevalent.
</P>
<P>
Almost 1,000 British schools had been connected free of
charge. Video-conferencing, distance learning and interactive
multimedia techniques would become valuable classroom tools, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said digital technology cable services would provide
enormous opportunities. "Those who are not able to move quickly
enough into this new digital marketplace are likely to find
themselves among the casualties of the revolution," he said.

<P>
LANZHOU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Money is growing on trees for
thousands of people living along a shelter belt spanning 17
provinces and autonomous regions in north, northwest and northeast
China.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of forests of economic value in the shelter belt
has increased from five percent in 1985 to over 50 percent last
year, according to Sun Bin, general engineer in charge of the
shelter belt construction.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 530,000 hectares of cash forests in
northwest China's Gansu Province, 60 percent of which are in the
shelter belt area.
</P>
<P>
The forest belt has provided a wealth of "money trees" for the
people in poverty-stricken areas, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The contribution rate of the shelter belt in the increase of
crop output is 15 to 20 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
A science and technology promotion network has been set up
across the province to provide technical aid to farmers.
</P>
<P>
The shelter forests have also become tourist sites in some
areas. Six national, and 18 province-level forest parks have been
set up in the shelter belt, attracting tens of thousands of
tourists every year.

<HEADLINE> Chile Sets up Volcano Monitoring Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The "Andes del Sur"
volcanological observatory was inaugurated today on Mt. Nielol,
in Temuco located in Chile's 9th region, to keep an eye on the
volcanic activity in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
The installation will help research studies on volcanic danger
and produce risk charts that will be useful so that authorities
can reduce dangers and design evacuation plans for the territory,
said Chile's Mining Minister Benjamin Teplizky.
</P>
<P>
The volcanological center which is over 5,000 square meters,
cost about 100 million pesos (240,000 dollars) and has equipped
with modern computer-controlled instruments.
</P>
<P>
The observatory was built in that zone because it is the one
with the most volcanic activity in Chile and the one that
concentrates the highest population density and the greatest
agricultural, industrial, tourist and hydroelectric development in
the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
There have been 109 reports of eruptions in four volcanos in
the 9th region since the past century, with the ones occurring in
Villarrica and Llaima accounting for 95 percent of them. There
are 55 active volcanos in Chile.
</P>
<P>
The Villarrica volcano is the most active one in South America
with a geological history that dates back about 500,000 years, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Teplizky announced that the observatory will maintain a watch
over the Peteroa volcano in the 7th region and Copahue in the 8th
region which are on the border with Argentina in which monitoring
facilities will be installed.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze Dolphin Recovers from Illness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The world's only adopted Yangtze
dolphin has recovered from liver disease and diabetes, according
to researchers at the Wuhan Research Institute of Hydrobiology.
</P>
<P>
The dolphin, named Qiqi, was adopted by the research institute
in January of 1980. It fell ill in April, for the second time in
nearly 17 years.
</P>
<P>
For months, several experts from the research institute gave up
their spare time to help save Qiqi's life. Experts in Japan, the
United States, and Hong Kong, Taiwan, and elsewhere in China also
offered suggestions, via telephone, for the treatment of Qiqi's
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The now-healthy dolphin leads a normal life at the research
institute, located in central China's Hubei Province.

<HEADLINE> Rain Ruins Hong Kong Tennis Championships Opening Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- On-and-off rains interrupted
the opening-day competitions and the organizers had to postpone
one of the four matches on the day's program as the 1996 Marlboro
Tennis Championships opened at the Victoria Park here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The upset of fourth-ranked Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the
hands of 61st-ranked Australian Patrick Rafter limelighted the
dull day. Rafter won the match 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
In other matches Tuesday, Byron Black from Zimbabwe, ranked
51st in the world, won over Grant Connell of Canada 6-3, 6-4 in a
match that was stopped at least two times.
</P>
<P>
And Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden followed with 6-2, 6-3 victory
over South Africa's Neville Godwin.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's only other match, that between Richey Reneberg and
fellow American Vincent Spadea, had to be postponed to Friday, due
to the rain.
</P>
<P>
American Peter Sampras, the world's number one and overwhelming
title favorite, and his arch rival, third-ranked Thomas Muster of
Austria both had the opening day off.
</P>
<P>
Sampras is bidding to win his second Hong Kong tennis title in
just sixth months, following his win in the Salem Open in April.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old American, who arrived here on Sunday, said he has
been in good shape and was confident to win the championships.
</P>
<P>
Muster, however, threatened here today to do away from the
Davis Cup if he is confronted in the futre with more crowd riot.
The former world number one walked out of the court during a Davis
Cup tie against hosts Brazil last month.
</P>
<P>
Although he claimed that some Brazilian fans cursed him and
threw missiles at him during the match, a Davis Cup panel decided
that security at the court was "very good". Te panel later handed
down a fine of 8,000 U.S. dollars for Muster's walk-out.
</P>
<P>
"If we continue to support those countries with bad behavior like
this when they're making up Davis Cup ties, sooner or later somebody
is going to be injured," Muster claimed.
</P>
<P>
"But it is not going to be me. Because if they continue like this,
I'm not interested in playing in Davis Cup any more. It's nothing to
do with the sport," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said he would have to pay the fine. "I guess I have no
choice," he admitted.
</P>
<P>
Sampras is to take on Connell while Muster meets Godwin Wednesday
evening.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Expand Pension Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China's largest city will
strive to bring over 95 percent of its work force as well as
laborers from outside the city under the coverage of the old-age
pension umbrella during the current Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will continue to reform its old-age pension system in
order to expand its coverage, said Zhao Mao, deputy director of
Shanghai Social Security Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said Shanghai's old-age pension system, which combines
defined benefits with funded individual accounts, has expanded to
cover administrative departments, a variety of enterprises and
institutions, and private businesses and business people.
</P>
<P>
By May, a total of 34,229 units, 4.23 million employees and
1.84 retired workers had had access to old-age pensions, which
translates into a coverage rate of 90 percent, Zhao said, adding
that "We will also include the laborers from outside the city in
our old-pension net during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period."

<HEADLINE> US Determined to Replace Boutros-Ghali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States will use
its veto power in the United Nations, if necessary, to make sure
there will be a new secretary-general by the end of the year, the
State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will not contemplate any formula to extend Boutros
Boutros-Ghali's mandate as the secretary-general, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
"We will move forward to look for another candidate and to put
a new secretary-general in place by the end of this year," State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. "And we will use the
veto power, if we have to, to make sure that that happens."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States would give "special consideration to
African candidates, but not sole consideration to them."
</P>
<P>
"African countries need to come up with a candidate," he said.
"This decision is going to be made sooner rather than later, it is
going to be made very soon in the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
He demanded that candidates from Africa be "good, credible,
impressive."
</P>
<P>
"If those candidates do not come forward, then, of course, the
United States and other countries will be looking elsewhere in the
world," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
There has been a tradition since the United Nations was
established in 1945 that any secretary-general will serve two
consecutive terms. But Burns said that would not be the case with
Boutros-Ghali. "It is not advisable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nor the Clinton administration was contemplating any formula to
extend Boutros-Ghali's mandate for a short period to allow him to
retire next year, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"We have an irrevocable decision here by the United States, a
firm, clear decision. We will use the veto if necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
Critics say the United States is trying to dominate the United
Nations by replacing Boutros-Ghali whom the United States sees as
incapable to implement the reforms in the interests of the
Americans.

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Industrial production in the
Muslim-Croat federation of Bosnia in September increased 104
percent compared with one year earlier, but it was merely 10.3
percent of the level before the war.
</P>
<P>
These are the figures released by the Bosnian Statistical
Bureau and reported today by the Oslobodjenjie daily.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also reported that in the first eight months of this
year, the federation side's exports were worth 20 million U.S.
dollars and imports worth 205 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
About 287,000 persons were employed and 133,130 unemployed,
meaning that the rate of jobless stands at one third of the
working force.
</P>
<P>
The average pay in September was 20,638 dinars (206 DM), but
the prices of necessities for a family of four are 334 DM.

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The first units of a
5,000-strong U.S. army brigade assigned to cover the withdrawal of
American peacekeeping troops from Bosnia entered the country
today.
</P>
<P>
The units of more than 500 soldiers, riding in two dozens of
U.S. army trucks and Humvee all-terrain vehicles, crossed over a
U.S. military pontoon bridge spanning the Sava River between
Zupanja, Croatia, and Orasje, Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The First Armored Division of the United States, with 15,000
soliders, is now stationed in northeastern Bosnia and its
scheduled withdrawal around the end of this year will be assisted
by the second brigade of the First Infantry Division.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Army statement said the force which arrived in Bosnia
included infantry, field artillery, air defense, engineering and
support units.
</P>
<P>
The brigade to cover the withdrawal of other U.S. troops is
scheduled to stay in Bosnia till the end of March, but could be
even longer depending on what will follow up the current NATO-led
multinational peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Other nations have made it clear that unless American troops
stay, they will also pull out all their forces, which will surely
rekindle the Bosnian war.

<HEADLINE> London, Frankfurt, Paris Stocks End at New Record Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
all surged strongly and closed at new record highs today though
all below their intraday peaks, propelled by a strong Wall Street
and firm gilts.
</P>
<P>
The London market had climbed to a record high of 4,063.2
points earlier in the day on the FTSE 100 index, supported by
soaring sterling, firm gilts and New York's record overnight
close.
</P>
<P>
However, share prices eased back in later trading and ended
12.1 points up at 4,050.8, still a new closing high, as Wall
Street's early rally ran out of steam.
</P>
<P>
But dealers said the market's tone was still bullish.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt surged past the 2,700 level on the
DAX-30 index and finished at an all-time record high of 2,728.45,
up 34.57 points, after overnight record gains on Wall Street and
strong bonds boosted prices.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse had also surged to a high of 2,176.45 during
the day, underpinned by European bond market gains and early
vitality on Wall Street, but later slipped back to end at a new
closing high for the year of 2,168.28, up 24.66 points.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed 12.1 points up at 4,050.8. The Frankfurt
DAX-30 share index ended up 34.57 at a record close of 2,728.45.
The Paris CAC-40 index finished 24.66 points higher at 2,168.28.

<HEADLINE> UK Factory Output Prices Rise 0.4 Pct in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Higher crude oil prices pushed
up UK manufacturers' fuel and raw material costs last month and
caused the first rise in factory output price inflation for 14
months, the Office for National Statistics reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Factory output prices rose by 0.4 percent in September after
remaining flat in August, pushing up the annual headline rate of
producer price inflation to 2.2 percent last month from 2.0
percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
However, stripping out food, drink, tobacco and petroleum, the
annual underlying output price inflation dropped from 1.3 percent
to 0.9 percent, the lowest annual rate since September 1967.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cost of raw materials to industry rose 0.3
percent in the month. But compared with a year ago, input prices
have dropped 2.9 percent, the biggest drop since March 1994.
</P>
<P>
City economists were cheered by the prices figures and argued
that they should lead to lower retail prices. They believed that
the figures would also support the Chancellor to resist pressure
for a rise in bank base rates.

<HEADLINE> US Rules Out Sending Troops to Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States will not
send its troops to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as a way of
enforcing the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, the State
Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"They don't need the United States between them, physically
on the ground," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Burns told reporters on the U.S. position after talking with
Secretary of State Warren Christopher who had said that U.S.
troops would not be sent to the West Bank or to Gaza as
peacemakers or in any other capacity.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat desired to
see U.S. troops in Hebron as part of the solution to implement the
peace agreement on Israel's withdrawal of its forces.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry said earlier that using U.S.
troops to help maintain security as Israeli troops withdraw from
Arab population areas had been proposed in the past, but "it is
not under active consideration."
</P>
<P>
Both leaders of the Palestinians and the former Israeli Labor
government agreed in 1993 and 1994 that the Israeli troops
withdraw from the West Bank city of Hebron, where Palestinian
residents constitute a majority of population while only hundreds
of Jews live there in their settlements.
</P>
<P>
But the Labor Party led by Shimon Peres was defeated in the May
elections by the Likud group and Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu
refused to immediately implement the accord under the pretext of
security.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and the Israelis are now holding talks on the
redeployment of the Israeli troops in Hebron after the Washington
summit on the Middle East peace process early this month.
</P>
<P>
Burns told reporters there still exist "substantial
differences" between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"We are working very hard to bridge the differences on Hebron
redeployment and on other issues between the Israelis and the
Palestinians," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. mediator Dennis Ross is shuttling between Jerusalem, Tel
Aviv and Gaza and meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu,
Palestinian leader Arafat, King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli
and Palestinian experts, Burns added.

Party (RP) that with the draft budget to be presented to the
parliament by Thursday midnight, Turkey would protect the civil
servants' salaries from inflation rate, which is expected to
surpass 70 percent at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
He added that the wage-earners' financial lot would be
"quickly improved."
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said: "From the economic standpoint the first step
which must be taken in Turkey is to introduce a balanced
budget."
</P>
<P>
Recently, Turkey has borrowed at high interest, up to 140-odd
percent. Funds borrowed at such rates make way to even greater
debts.
</P>
<P>
"This is a vicious circle. The state must definitely be rid of
its debts. The more the debts soar, the less production and
exports there is. Unemployment goes up, national income falls,
and the leap for development cannot take place," said the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister pointed out that his government would
attach great importance to the development of the defense
industry whose exports would gain Turkey big profits.

<HEADLINE> Britain: 80 Percent of Heroin Trade Shipped via </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior British official said
today that 80 percent of all the heroin confiscated by customs
officials in the United Kingdom is shipped via Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Deputy Home Secretary Tom Sackville made the remarks
during a visit to Istanbul Police Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Sackville said that the British government would offer help
and assistance to Turkey in its struggle against drug
trafficking and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need for cooperation between the two
countries in their struggle against drugs.
</P>
<P>
"Any cooperation should be based on intelligence and good
resources. Officials of the two countries should trust each
other," he added.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul Police Chief Kemal Yazicioglu said that the sources
of the drug are Middle Eastern and South Asian countries, adding
that these drugs are shipped to Europe and Britain via Turkey or
other Black Sea states.
</P>
<P>
Yazicioglu said that "terrorist organizations," particularly
the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), are involved in drug
trafficking, and therefore the struggle against drug smuggling
and terrorism should "go hand in hand."

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average lost some grounds today, a day after its first close above
the 6,000 mark, as profit-taking offset strong earnings reports
of industrial giants such as Intel and General Motors.
</P>
<P>
The Dow fell 5.22 to 6,004.78.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin, with
the total volume reaching 458.87 million shares, up from 322.00
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Most broader stock measures, except for Nasdaq, also turned
lower.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.99 to 702.55, and
the NYSE's composite index fell 0.63 to 373.60.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 1.75 to 1,258.11, a new high,
and the American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 3.68 to
575.65.
</P>
<P>
After trading closed Monday, Intel surpassed analysts' most
optimistic expectations, reporting a 41 percent gain in
third-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
General Motors, meanwhile, followed through on Monday's strong
showing by Chrysler, beating forecasts with a third-quarter profit
that nearly doubled last year's earnings for the period.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Caterpillar, the Dow's biggest gainer, and Eastman
Kodak both exceeded expectations with their third-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
Monday's momentous close on Wall Street also stimulated an up
mood overseas today. Tokyo, Frankfurt, London and Hong Kong also
showed new gains.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Hold Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
will arrive here Wednesday to brief Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on the Palestinian-Israeli talks on the long-delayed
redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is also expected to brief Mubarak on his talks with
Jordan's King Hussein in the West Bank town of Jericho today.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein, who met Arafat in Amman Monday, visited the West
Bank today for the first time since the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with Arafat in Jericho, King Hussein said
he and Arafat would cooperate closely from now on to make sure
Israel kept its promises made in the peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second time for Arafat to visit Egypt in just
10 days. Arafat met Mubarak in Egypt's city of Ismailia on
October 7.
</P>
<P>
Arafat often comes to Egypt for consultations with Mubarak
over the Middle East peace process, particularly the
Palestinian-Israeli talks. Mubarak has acted as a mediator in
Arab-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti will also visit
Egypt Wednesday for talks on efforts to push forward the Middle
East peace process, Egypt's news agency MENA said today.
</P>
<P>
The visits by Arafat and Kabariti to Egypt come at a time when
the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the Hebron issue, which
had been scheduled to resume Monday at Egypt's resort town of
Taba, were postponed twice, first to Tuesday and then to
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said today that the Hebron talks were deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between Israel and Palestine, Israeli
troops should have pulled out of Hebron in March.
</P>
<P>
But the withdrawal was delayed by Hamas activists' suicide
bombings which killed over 60 people in late February and early
March and further postponed by the election of Israeli hardline
Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu as the prime minister in late
May.

<HEADLINE> Corporate, Gov't Gulf War Compensation Claims to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Compensation Commission
(UNCC) announced here today that it will start next year to
process corporate and government compensation claims for losses
induced by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Five years after its creation by the U.N. Security Council in
1991 to deal with Gulf War-related compensations, the UNCC has so
far received 2.6 million claims with an asserted value over 200
billion dollars. The bulk of this asserted value comes from claims
by corporations and governments.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNCC which just concluded a two-day meeting of
its Governing Council today, the processing of individual claims,
which were given priority for humanitarian purposes, will be
completed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Due to limited available finances, the commission has given
first priority to category B individual claims for death or
personal injury. Awards to all 4,000 successful claimants among a
total of 6,000 have been paid in full, amounting to 13.4 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Today, the processing of category A claims for individual
losses related to departure from Iraq or Kuwait because of the
invasion has also been concluded.
</P>
<P>
About 96 percent of some 910,000 category A claims have been
approved and some 3.2 billion dollars of awards have been issued.
But those awards could only be paid after the commission received
the fund from Iraqi oil proceedings due to the implementation of
U.N. Security Council Resolution 986, the UNCC said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Compensation Fund administered by the UNCC holds
only 7 million dollars. Under Security Council Resolution 986, the
fund is supposed to get 30 percent of the revenue generated by
Iraqi oil exports.

<HEADLINE> Britain Should Not Block European Single Currency: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain could keep its options
open on a single European currency but should not prevent its
European partners from joining the European Monetary Union (EMU),
according to a senior British business leader.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at a dinner party in London this evening,
Director-General of the Confederation of British industry Adair
Turner said that it was in Britain's national interest that the
EMU should be a success, whether or not Britain was a founding
member.
</P>
<P>
"Should we try to stop the others from going ahead? The answer
is an unequivocal no," Turner said.
</P>
<P>
"It's no because there may well be a strong case for an inner
core going ahead with EMU -- even if we don't -- and if so we
should not stand in the way of that economic logic," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British business leader also stressed that Britain should
try to ensure that the EMU, which is going to emerge, is more
likely to be one it might want to join.
</P>
<P>
"But while one of the aims of keeping the option open should be
to maintain our influence, it should not be the sole aim. Keeping
the option open is also important because the right choice for
Britain may be to enter," he added.
</P>
<P>
The British government has negotiated an opt-out from the
single currency agreed in the Maastricht Treaty on further
European integration, and also promised that it will decide at the
appropriate time whether or not to take part in the single
currency.

<P>
NEW YORK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose to a
32-month high against the Japanese yen today after a report
suggested the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) could win a majority
in parliamentary elections this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Traders believed that the LDP in control would ease the
pressure for higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The rise was also aided by an outflow of funds from Japan into
other currencies. The British currency continued its run against
the U.S. dollar to set a new 12-month high. The dollar gained also
against the German mark.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 112.18 yen from
111.55 yen late Monday, reaching its highest level since late
January 1994.
</P>
<P>
The British pound advanced to 1.5870 U.S. dollars from 1.5785
U.S. dollars, its highest against the greenback since last
October. The dollar also rose to 1.5407 marks from 1.5289 marks
late Monday, its highest level since May.

NEW YORK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Two large utilities in
California of the United States, the Enova Corporation and Pacific
Enterprises, announced Monday that they would emerge, forming the
country's largest, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The merger of Enova, which owns San Diego Gas and Electric, and
Pacific Enterprises, which owns the Southern California Gas
Company, the nation's largest gas utility, would create a company
with a market value of 5.2 billion U.S. dollars, the report
commented.
</P>
<P>
The new company will set a prime example of the kind of utility
that is emerging as state regulators open power markets to greater
competition. More than 10 states, including California, already
allow larger customers to buy their natural gas from outside
customers. This will be the first merger by utilities in
California.

<HEADLINE> Traditions Play Role in Rising or Down of Jobless Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Analyzing the unemployment
in the United States and other Western countries, U.S. economists
said that old traditions also play a big role.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in the U.S. has been declining since 1993
and it was at 5.2 percent in September. But recent figures from
the U.S. Labor Department showed a continuing rise in joblessness
among other big industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
Japan hit a record 3.6 percent in June, higher than any in the
21 years reported. Western Germany, France, Italy and Sweden also
all had record or near-record figures of 7 percent to 12 percent
in the first half of this year. Britain, Canada and Australia
reported slight downward trends in unemployment, but were still in
the 8 percent to 9 percent range.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economists said tradition is one powerful reason for the
rising of unemployment in European countries.
</P>
<P>
People in many other countries are less mobile than in the U.S.
and show more attachment to the regions where their families may
have lived for centuries, they said.
</P>
<P>
"There's no parallel to the big American movement to the Sun
Belt" states of the South, said Thomas Carothers, senior associate
at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
</P>
<P>
But there is little movement of workers in Europe across
national borders, said Ralph C. Bryant, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
"And people don't like to move easily, even between Marseilles
and Paris, or Munich and Hamburg," he said.
</P>
<P>
Carothers also pointed to the U.S. surge in computers and
related industries, creating jobs for both highly trained
engineers and sales clerks. Other countries are well behind, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Carothers suggested that high labor costs in Europe and Japan
also have driven jobs away and increased the number of people out
of work.

<HEADLINE> US Says Iraq Rebuilds Defense System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq rebuilt a
surface-to-air missile network in southern Iraq last month within
two weeks after the United States launched two cruise missile
strikes to destroy it, a senior U.S. defense official has said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the same basic (anti-aircraft missile system) that was
there the 30th of August 1996" before the U.S. missile attacks,
said the official quoted by the Washington Post today.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. military officer told reporters that the Iraqis
have been able to rebuild parts of the system. "They've been
slapping things together," he added. He said the rebuilt system
has not yet threatened U.S. aircraft.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warships and planes launched 44 cruise missiles against
the Iraqi defense system on September 2 and 3 in retaliation for
the Iraqi troops' offensive into the U.S.-imposed no-fly zone in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Since the attacks, the Iraqis have not used the surface-to-air
missile radar of their missiles. But the defense official said it
would take just "a flip of the switch" to turn on the targeting
radar to create a military threat to U.S. and allied aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"If they turn the radar on to radiate, it poses a military
threat," he said. But he added, "there is no indication" on Iraq's
part "of an intent to challenge" U.S. and allied aircraft.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq's air defense system was weaker than before and
the U.S. intelligence knew "where they are and we can get to them."
And the Iraq's system was old and would be tough to maintain or
repair with existing equipment inventory, he added.

<HEADLINE> US CSX to Buy Conrail in 8.4 Billion Dollar Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- CSX Corp. announced in
Philadephia today that it has agreed to pay 8.4 billion U.S.
dollars in cash and stock for Conrail Inc. in a deal that will
create one of the world's biggest railway freight companies.
</P>
<P>
The deal would create a railroad powerhouse dominating the
eastern half of the United States from Chicago to New Orleans and
from Boston, New York to Miami.
</P>
<P>
The company would have annual revenues of more than 14 billion
dollars, serving shippers in 22 states with a 29,600-mile system.
</P>
<P>
The transaction is expected to be completed in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The latest merger wave came in the wake of two other giant rail
mergers. In July, federal regulators gave the green light to a
merger between the Southern Pacific (CP) and the Union Pacific
(UP) railroads, which created a system with 35,000 miles of track
in 25 states, Mexico and Canada. Last year, the merger of
Burlington Northern and Santa Fe was approved, which created a
system with 33,000 miles of track in the Midwest, West and
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
CSX, based in Richmond, Virginia state, is an international
transportation company. Conrail, based in Philadelphia, was
created by the government in the 1970s to buy the Penn Central and
other bankrupt railroads of the Northeast and Midwest. The company
was sold to the public in 1987. It now operates an 11,000-mile
freight network in 12 northeastern and Midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
John W. Snow, chairman, president and chief executive of CSX,
would be chairman and chief executive of the combined company and
David M. LeVan, Conrail's chairman, would be No. 2 as president
and chief operating officer.

<HEADLINE> Cease-Fire Monitors to Continue Meeting in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The cease-fire monitoring
committee overseeing the implementation of a cease-fire
understanding between Israel and Lebanon is to hold a meeting in
a south Lebanese border town Wednesday morning to look into a
complaint lodged by Lebanon against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the committee, which comprises the United
States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, will meet at 11:00
a.m. Wednesday in Naqoura, sources close to the Lebanese
delegation to the committee said tonight.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon filed the complaint to the committee after Israeli
occupation forces shelled the south Lebanese village of Safad
AI-Batikh Friday, wounding 13 civilians.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up following the signing of a cease-fire
understanding between Lebanon and the Jewish state on April 26.
</P>
<P>
At a Monday meeting, the committee decided to send a
fact-finding team, at Lebanon's request, to Safad AI-Batikh to
verify the accusation that Israel used internationally banned
weapons in the Friday bombardment.
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour investigation in the village, the Lebanese
sources said, the team, made up of Americans, Lebanese, Syrians
and French without an Israeli member, examed the traces of the
shelling and collected shrapnels of Israeli cluster bombs.
</P>
<P>
Then the team went to the outskirts of the village and
inspected a place where guerrillas of Lebanon's Shiite Hezbollah,
or Party of God, launched an attack at Israeli forces, drawing
the retaliatory bombardment
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another team comprising Americans and French
carried out a mission of investigating an Israeli artillery
position from where the Israeli forces opened fire at Safad
AI-Batikh.
</P>
<P>
The fact-finding teams were the first sent out by the
committee since its establishment in accordance with the
cease-fire understanding, which put an end to a 17-day Israeli
blitz in south Lebanon in April.
</P>
<P>
The understanding says Israel and Hezbollah are committed to
ensuring that under no circumstances will civilians be the
target of attack or will civilian areas be the launching
ground for attacks.
</P>
<P>
But it allows Hezbollah to attack Israeli troops in south
Lebanon and allows Israel "the right of self-defense."
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by guerrillas and air strikes and
bombardments by Israeli occupation forces constitute a daily
scene in south Lebanon, the last active battle front of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state set up a 850-square-kilometer "security zone"
in south Lebanon in 1985 as a buffer to prevent cross-border
guerrilla attacks on its northern Jewish settlements.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows 9 Million New Motor Voter Registration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Voter registration across
the United States has increased by 9 million since the motor voter
law went into effect in January 1995, said a study released today.
</P>
<P>
The total represents 17 percent of the 54 million people who
had been unregistered in states covered by the new system,
according to the study, prepared for the League of Women Voters
and the NAACP by Human Serve, a bipartisan New York-based
organization.
</P>
<P>
From January 1995 to June 1996, about 20 million people either
registered to vote for the first time, re-registered or updated
their registrations using the law.
</P>
<P>
The National Voter Rights Act requires states to offer voter
registration through state agencies such as driver's license
offices and is therefore called the motor voter law.
</P>
<P>
The league estimates that an additional 6 million will register
by the end of the year, making 1995-96 the period with the largest
increase in voter registration of any two-year span in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
Democratic affiliation declined from 50 percent to 49 percent
among those registering, Republican registration stayed at 34
percent and independent and other party registration rose from 16
percent to 17 percent, the study said.
