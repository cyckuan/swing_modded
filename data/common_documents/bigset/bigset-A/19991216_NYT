COMPUTER COLUMN: VIRUSES AND THEIR CURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We are entering the plague years of computer viruses. In recent
weeks a number of new, malicious and destructive viruses have been
detected on the Internet and in the networks of several large
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the director of the FBI's National Infrastructure
Protection Center, Michael A. Vatis, said the agency was on alert
for a possible flurry of computer attacks, including viruses, timed
to coincide with the already difficult year 2000 transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's natural to expect there might be people doing stupid
things with computers,'' Vatis said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Fithen, manager of the Computer Emergency Response Team at
Carnegie Mellon University, a project that receives part of its
financing from the Department of Defense, said: ``We are
anticipating a lot of date-triggered viruses because of Jan. 1.
This is really a time to be diligent'' in following standard
antivirus procedures, Ms. Fithen said, ``but it's not a time for
panic.'' The team maintains a computer security Web page at
www.cert.org/y2kinfo.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the newer threats, including viruses called Prilissa
and Mypics, are scheduled to do their nastiest work in coming
weeks, in Prilissa's case when someone opens an infected e-mail
attachment on Christmas Day, and when Mypics detects the computer's
clock changing to 2000. Other viruses are expected to emerge in
coming weeks as their twisted creators try to capitalize on
Y2K-related confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these viruses can reformat your hard disk drive,
permanently erasing all the files on it. Some can mail themselves
to your friends and associates by commandeering your e-mail address
book. There is even one that can alter your system and notify the
hacker via e-mail when your computer is vulnerable to further
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   So, it is time for a refresher on viruses and the simple,
prudent precautions you can take to minimize the chances of your
computer becoming infected. Although the risk of receiving a virus
is relatively small for home computer users, there is a risk.
</P>
<P>
   Viruses are frightening to many novice computer users in part
because they are relatively rare and not well understood. (Viruses
are also frightening to many experienced computer users who
understand viruses all too well, not because they are particularly
dangerous, but rather because they are a major pain to deal with.)
There is no need to panic. There are plenty of unavoidable
annoyances that come with computers these days, so it seems a shame
to waste more time and energy on viruses and worms, which are so
easily avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Here we go.
</P>
<P>
   For people who have no reason to believe their systems have been
infected: 1. Back up (make copies of) all your important files.
</P>
<P>
   2. Get in the habit of making regular backups.
</P>
<P>
   3. Get an anti-virus program and use it.
</P>
<P>
   4. Update the program frequently by downloading new virus
signature files from the software maker's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   People who suspect their computer may be infected should start
with steps 3 and 4, make sure their systems are virus-free, and
then do steps 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of a surge in virus hoaxes in coming weeks, many
of the world's anti-virus software makers are offering fully
functional, 90-day trial versions of their programs, including free
updates, until Dec. 31. The Microsoft Corp. has assembled links to
these free programs on a Web page at
www.microsoft.com/y2k/antivirus/antivirus.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Many new computers come from the factory loaded with an
anti-virus program, so you may not need to buy one. But whether the
program comes already installed or from a store shelf, it should be
updated quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, several significant viruses and worms have
been detected for the first time, including Prilissa, Babylonia and
Worm.Explore.Zip(pack), alias the MiniZip worm, which is
particularly nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Many people install an anti-virus program and assume,
erroneously, that they are safe from future infection. This is like
installing smoke detectors in your home and then never changing the
batteries.
</P>
<P>
   I use Symantec's Norton Antivirus for both my Windows and
Macintosh computers. (While early disk-based viruses typically
targeted one type of computer or another, newer e-mail-based
viruses attack different kinds of computers impartially.) Norton
Antivirus 2000 version 6.0 for Windows costs $39.95 and the
Macintosh version 6.0 is $69.95; they can be downloaded from
Symantec's Web site (www.symantec.com). Another highly regarded
anti-virus program for is McAfee's VirusScan 4.0, which costs
$29.95 and is available at www.mcafee.com/centers/anti-virus/).
</P>
<P>
   The most prevalent villains on the virus scene are so-called
macro viruses, which typically arrive in e-mail attachments. Virus
writers seem to be particularly fond of Microsoft products,
including Windows, Word, Outlook and Outlook Express, so users of
those programs should be especially vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   In general, simply reading an e-mail message will not infect
your computer, even if the subject line of the message says,
``There is a mean, ugly, nasty virus hidden in this message.''
</P>
<P>
   The real danger is in opening file attachments that come
appended to e-mail messages. You should never, ever, under any
circumstances, open an attached file unless you are absolutely sure
you know from whom it comes, what it does and that the person who
sent it intended to send it to you.
</P>
<P>
   If the attachment contains one of these macro viruses, opening
the file can cause the infection. If there is any doubt whatsoever
about the nature of the attachment, just dump it in the trash. Then
empty the trash.
</P>
<P>
   Second, turn off the functions in your computer that open
so-called macro applications automatically. Your software manual
will tell you how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the newer viruses arrive as e-mail attachments,
viruses can come from any number of sources, including commercial,
shrink-wrapped software. It is prudent to check all new software
before installing it. It is annoying, but not nearly as annoying as
losing files and rebuilding a hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   There. That wasn't so hard.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now, copy this article and send it immediately to the first 50
people in your address book, and tell them all to do the same. If
it reaches two million people by Jan. 1, Bill Gates will send
$1,000 and free tickets to Disneyland to everyone on the forwarding
lists.
</P>
<P>
   Stop! This is a hoax, and it is one of the most common stupid
things people do with computers. Gates is one of the most generous
philanthropists of our time, but he does not pay people to clog the
Internet with inane e-mail messages that replicate like computer
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   As a home computer user you are far more likely to be the
recipient of a virus hoax than you are to be the recipient of a
virus.
</P>
<P>
   The typical hoax letter says that there is a new and
particularly nasty virus on the loose, confirmed by (insert the
name of some completely irrelevant organization like the Federal
Communications Commission), and that if you open an e-mail message
with a certain subject line, a virus will delete all the files on
your hard drive. In almost all cases, the hoax letter will urge the
recipient to pass this important message along to as many people as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Don't do it. Instead, go to the Internet site
ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html, which lists the most common
hoaxes in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember that computers can do weird things and mess up
your files without the aid of a virus. I have a friend who
immediately suspects computer viruses whenever the printer stops
working or her system crashes. As far as I can tell, the only thing
that is infecting her computer is Windows 98.

BRITISH CABLE TELEVISION CONCERN EXPECTED TO DISCLOSE ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Telewest Communications PLC, Britain's second-largest
cable television company, is expected to announce as early as
Thursday that it will acquire Flextech PLC, a British TV production
concern, for about 1.9 billion pounds, or $3 billion, executives
close to the talks said on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   If the acquisition proceeds, Telewest, whose biggest
shareholders include Microsoft and AT&AMP;T's Liberty Media Group,
would be able to create a $14.4 billion company that both produces
and distributes programming over one cable system. The move is
expected to make Telewest more competitive with British Sky
Broadcasting Group, the satellite television company that is 40
percent owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and NTL Inc., the
acquisition-hungry British cable company that bought the Swiss
company Cablecom this week.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from both companies spent the evening working out
terms of the deal, though a final agreement will not be reached
until sometime in January when due diligence is completed, the
executives said. The executives stressed that there was still a
chance that the talks could break down and that the deal could be
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said that the all-stock offer was below
Flextech's closing price on Wednesday, though the offer constituted
a premium of almost 10 percent over Flextech's share price when
speculation about a possible combination began earlier this month.
Both companies acknowledged they were in talks on Dec. 6.
Executives from both companies are expected to maintain roles at
the company. Spokesmen from the companies could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Telewest's ambition to own programming
operations mimics the success of B Sky B, which has pursued a
similar strategy. It produces and distributes its own branded
premium programming like sports and film channels over its
satellite system. Owning Flextech would give Telewest ownership of
premium television channels like Bravo and Living in Britain.

HONG KONG HIGH COURT RULES THAT DEFACING CHINA'S FLAG IS CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 11th graf to correct name of judge issuing concurring
opinion. His name is Kemal Bohary, not Sir Anthony Mason.)  (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Steering clear of another legal confrontation with
the Chinese government, the top court in Hong Kong on Wednesday
ruled that defacing the Chinese flag is a crime. The decision was a
victory for the local government and reversed a lower court's
ruling that defacing the flag was a form of expression guaranteed
by the constitution of this former British colony.
</P>
<P>
   Striking down a Hong Kong law that protects the flag, legal
experts said, could have led to a showdown with China. The law was
adopted by the new legislature here hours after the colony reverted
to Chinese rule in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The flag decision was released a week after the court had said
that Beijing had the right to overturn its landmark decision that
granted residency to more than a million people from mainland
China. Taken together, the rulings prompted some critics here to
contend that the Hong Kong judiciary had lost its independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid people will see this as a trend,'' said Hong Kong
Democratic Party leader Martin Lee. ``It won't be long before Hong
Kong goes down the same route as Singapore or mainland China, where
the courts never rule against the government on sensitive cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a lawyer, refused to comment on the case itself. Other
legal experts noted that unlike the immigration case, where the
court made a well-reasoned decision that Beijing overturned,
Wednesday's decision involved a thorny issue that has bedeviled
courts in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure people will say the court is collapsing,'' said
former Hong Kong Solicitor General Daniel Fung. ``But this ruling
is not a knee-jerk response to executive pressure. On the contrary,
the judges are looking at how other mature jurisdictions have
approached this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The case stemmed from a pro-democracy rally in January 1998 in
which two men, Ng Kung-siu and Lee Kin-yun, carried heavily defaced
Chinese and Hong Kong flags. Both flags were torn, smeared with
black ink and had the Chinese word for ``shame'' scrawled on them.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the two argued that they had the right to express
themselves, even by destroying the flags, under the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is enshrined in the
Hong Kong constitution. The government countered that the men had
violated laws that protect national and regional flags. The
defendants won their case on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In the 51-page ruling, Chief Justice Andrew Li acknowledged that
the flag ordinance restricted civil liberties. But Li said it did
not stifle other forms of political expression, and he said it was
justified because the Chinese flag symbolized Hong Kong's effort to
integrate itself into the Chinese motherland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protection of the national flag and the regional flag from
desecration, having regard for their unique symbolism, will play an
important part in the attaining these goals,'' the judge declared.
</P>
<P>
   In a concurring opinion, another justice, Kemal Bokhary, seemed
eager to show that Hong Kong was squarely in the mainstream of
international legal opinion. He noted that defacing the flag was a
crime in Germany and Italy. The Portuguese colony of Macau, which
returns to Chinese rule Sunday, also recently banned the practice.
Even in the United States, where the Supreme Court has struck down
state laws that would make flag burning a crime, Bokhary noted that
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy had expressed distaste in voting to keep
it legal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the judge acknowledged that the ban was ``just within the
outer limits of constitutionality.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Chen, the dean of the law faculty at the University of
Hong Kong, said, ``The case could have gone either way.'' But he
noted that the Chinese flag played a more sensitive role here than
national flags in other countries because it is ``one of the few
manifestations of Chinese sovereignty in Hong Kong.''

BACK TO CHALKBOARD FOR ODOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the education of a basketball prodigy begins surrendering
to the new math, the student may be obliged to stay after school.
</P>
<P>
   We now can expect to find Clippers rookie Lamar Odom camped at
the chalkboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to get back in the gym, get in the weight room,''
Odom said after Tuesday's 2-point performance in his team's barking
loss to the Lakers. ``I have to be more of a warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   Good idea _ while the Clippers were getting spanked by their
down-the-hall rivals, the Golden State Warriors were knocking off
the Miami Heat. And the Warriors will show up at Staples Center
Friday to see if the Clippers have enough pride to put their latest
catastrophe behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here has pride or they wouldn't be in the NBA,'' said
Odom, whose 5-17 team's recent 1-10 moonwalk may have more than a
coincidental relationship with the forward's personal, on-court
funk. ``I have to keep being a good teammate and not worry about my
own stats ... which I never do anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, this is a wonderful strategy that seems even better
when viewed beneath the reading lamp of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Since scoring 24 points in a victory over the New York Knicks,
Odom has made 54 of his next 144 field-goal attempts, a success
rate of 37 percent. Astute NBA film scholars noticed that Odom
prefers taking the ball to the hoop; in recent weeks, opposing
defenses have begun daring Odom to fire from distance.
</P>
<P>
   An even more important welcome wagon has left the tour, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clippers' first 11 games, hospitable NBA referees
escorted the kid to the line for 94 free throws. In the last 11
games _ despite frequent drives to the hoop that yield little aside
from various aches and pains _ Odom has be rewarded with only 41
free-throw attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm blaming nobody else but Lamar Odom,'' said Lamar Odom,
whose rising celebrity has inspired reporters from ESPN The
Magazine and the Boston Globe to track his progress this week. ``I
know it's going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   (subhead) Ankles away
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's not getting much better in the wheels department.
</P>
<P>
   One night after shooting guard Derek Anderson parlayed a
second-degree ankle sprain into two weeks of rehab, forward Brian
Skinner responded with a copycat injury.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, who also is expected to miss two weeks, was on crutches
Wednesday, but still rolled out in a sharp suit and power tie to
attend the team's charitable event at the AMC Theatres complex at
Norwalk. Clippers players, coaches and staff spent about 90 minutes
with children from the United Rescue Mission.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chris Ford gave the players a day off from practice to
recuperate (mentally as well as physically), autograph T-shirts and
hand out toys in an effort coordinated by Denise Booth of the
team's community relations department.
</P>
<P>
   (subhead) SOS not out yet
</P>
<P>
   With his options reduced, Ford said he and Elgin Baylor, the
team's vice president of basketball operations, would discuss
possible acquisitions to produce a near-depth experience.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, who attended Wednesday's event at Norwalk, said no
roster moves were imminent.

EIGHT TITLES FOR ANGLERS ON YOUR LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Overviews of recent books anglers on your holiday
gift list might enjoy reeling in: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are few areas that have more angling books dedicated to it
than the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Thank goodness, for there is
always room for more titles as fans of the magical waters of
California's backbone gladly accept all comers.
</P>
<P>
   The 120-page ``Fly Fishing the Sierra Nevada'' (Aguabonita
Books; $24.95) by long-time Northern California newspaperman Bill
Sunderland is the latest edition.
</P>
<P>
   The author's reviews and assessments _ from the underappreciated
Yuba River to the overfished Owens River _ are superlative, if
brief. Much of the artwork, including some memorable motion-blurred
streamside photographs by Paolo Marchesi, is terrific. The maps are
more than adequate to get the interested recreationist on the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Sunderland is a matter-of-fact writer and the chapters certainly
come off as no-nonsense. Don't expect poetry, but keep a pen and
paper handy to jot notes and pick a site. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One can't help but harken back to days of angling as a mere pup
after gazing upon the cornball and comedic postcards of trout
fishermen, the full-page ads for fishing rods when the top
hollow-cord steel construction was $12.75 and a chapter titled ``My
First Fishing Pole.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all here in ``100 Years of Fishing'' (Voyageur Press;
$39.95), strung together in gangion fashion by the publishing
house's editors.
</P>
<P>
   Pick your decade; the writings of such luminaries as former
presidents Grover Cleveland and Jimmy Carter, brilliant authors
Zane Grey and Ernest Hemingway and renowned fly-anglers Joan Wulff
and Nick Lyons grace this unique fishing perspective in
chronological order. I identified with the 1967 essay by beatnik
Richard Brautigan of ``Trout Fishing in America'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   With its stunning photographs and strange blend of class and
kitsch, the 224-page ``100 Years of Fishing'' has something for
everyone. It's the best of this bunch herein. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Penned by 26-year editor at Field &AMP; Stream magazine, ``Ken
Schultz's Fishing Encyclopedia: Worldwide Angling Guide'' (IDG
Books Worldwide; $60) is massive if nothing else. When was the last
time you heard of a fishing book that had 1,916 pages between the
covers? At the very least it would make a good rockcod sinker.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, it is much more than a paperweight. This encyclopedia
is the be all and end all of angling references. Where else can you
find an entry _ and engaging illustration _ on unsnagging?
Consider: ``Before applying direct, hard-pulling pressure ... first
try taking the line ahead of the rod tip, bringing it taut, and
then making a snap release.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know that. Bet you'll find a ton of things you didn't
know in this over-the-top publication, replete with 2,000 entries
and 1,400 pictures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Serious ocean shore-fishing is fairly defined by striped bass on
both sides of the country. Stripers have a remarkable reputation as
a game fish and apparently have enjoyed an equally remarkable
comeback in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   More for the angling techie, ``Stripers on the Fly'' (Lyons
Press; $40) will provide a closer examination of the tackle, fly
patterns, casting techniques and fish-finding skills that could
improve odds of success on the spirited anadromous fish that hatch
in freshwater (and thus often swim upstream into lakes; Castaic,
for example, has a huge population) and spend most of their days in
estuaries, bays and coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticutauthor Lou Tabory should have the know-how (and 284
pages to flaunt it); he is billed on the book jacket as ``one of
the great pioneers in Northeast saltwater fly-fishing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Trout Unlimited's Guide to America's 100 Best Trout Streams''
(Falcon; $18.95) is a great idea. Even if none of the rivers is on
anybody else's list, it's a winning concept because people
 &UR; !ital! &LR; will go fish waters profiled in such a manner.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the source is reputable, to say the least. Author
John Ross, a columnist for Sporting Classics magazine, was provided
with data for the impressive list from ballots cast by 1,200
members of the conservation group Trout Unlimited.
</P>
<P>
   So that there were no arguments over placement of rivers on the
list, they are provided in geographic order over the 352 pages,
from east to west.
</P>
<P>
   We appreciate that the Eastern Sierra's Hot Creek, Owens River
and San Joaquin River were included, but to omit the East Walker
River is unforgivable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Making the leap from novel writing to the art of authoring an
outdoors title wouldn't seem to be particularly difficult,
especially for someone with the credentials of Craig Nova, whose
name is found on the cover of ``The Good Son'' and other acclaimed
works.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent reviewers have all but dubbed the writer a super Nova
for his 111-page autobiography ``Brook Trout and the Writing Life''
(Lyons Press; $20).
</P>
<P>
   While Nova has a lifetime of experience angling for brookies in
New York, Vermont and Maine, his publishers have already put the
book in the same vein as Hemingway's contributions and Norman
Maclean's classic, ``A River Runs Through It.'' Impressive company;
you be the judge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two illustrations per page. Not many, one might say, but that's
definitely the best part of ``The Field &AMP; Stream Fishing Knots
Handbook'' (Lyons Press; $9.95).
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever tried to duplicate a knot presented in one of
those complimentary but all-too-often dinky and hard-to-decipher
handouts provided at tackle shops, you'll appreciate the clarity of
the step-by-step images of such angling necessities as the clinch
knot, Palomar knot, dropper loop and surgeon's knot.
</P>
<P>
   Graphic artist Peter Owen gives a yeoman's effort in this
107-page volume from Field &AMP; Stream magazine's Hunting and Fishing
Library of handbooks for outdoorsmen.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the titles that have come across my desk, this will be
the one that goes in my tackle box. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may not offer much more than an occasional laugh. But if
``The Laws of Angling: A Stringer Full of Fishing's Eternal
Verities'' (Andrews McMeel Publishing; $9.95) can even illicit a
smile from some cranky old salt, it's worth the price.
</P>
<P>
   With such pearls of wisdom _ har-har _ as, ``The first thing you
catch after sharpening your hooks will be your ear'' and ``The
surest way to lose an expensive lure is to use it,'' this square,
5{-inch-wide book is good for a stocking stuffer but not much
else.The best place for it on board is undoubtedly the head.
</P>
<P>
   While mostly tongue in cheek, author Randy Voorhees does offer
some sincere notions in the 92 pages. ``Few anglers are born with a
natural talent for catching fish,'' he pens, ``but nearly all could
lie like hell while they were still in diapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen to that.
</P>
<P>
   And here's to happy reading and a merry millennium.

NETS DEFEAT CAVALIERS, 111-101 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New Jersey Nets were so charmed on
Wednesday night that at one point Jamie Feick, their undersized yet
somewhat lumbering center, was swishing long jump shots. At other
times, Kendall Gill, who has spent much of the season in search of
his touch, was on target from the perimeter. And once, Stephon
Marbury scrambled for a loose ball, penetrated desperately and sank
a contested 12-footer that barely beat the 24-second shot clock
while he lost a shoe.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of night for the Nets. One on which, except for
brief periods and a late-game tantrum that earned Gill two
technical fouls and an automatic ejection, the Nets could do no
wrong against Cleveland. They shot well, had active, flicking hands
on defense and executed proficiently in defeating the Cavaliers,
111-101, before an announced crowd of 12,767 at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Nets' fourth in their last five games and
pushed their record to 6-16. Those four victories have all been by
double-digit margins, and three of them have come against teams
with winning records. The Nets snapped a six-game losing streak to
the Cavaliers dating to Nov. 16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Though it seems unfathomable, the success may be going to the
Nets' heads. Coach Don Casey was flippant after being told that the
Nets had moved ahead of the Washington Wizards (6-17) and out of
the bottom spot in the Atlantic Division. When reminded that the
order could change when the Nets play at Washington on Thursday,
Casey said: ``Yes, it could. I doubt it, but it could.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets say such brashness is good. They believe cockiness and
toughness are what they were missing earlier in the season. For
that reason, those associated with the club, from the coaching
staff to the bench players, were glad to see Gill shove Cleveland
center Andrew DeClercq in the fourth quarter. ``It's good to be
frisky,'' Casey said.
</P>
<P>
   Gill said DeClercq had been throwing cheap shots all night, and
when he saw DeClercq muscling up Keith Van Horn with five minutes
left in the game, he pushed his shoulder into DeClercq's back.
DeClercq got in Gill's face, and then Gill pushed him before the
officials slapped them both with technical fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, who led the Nets with 27 points and 8 rebounds,
insisted that he had nothing to do with the exchange, but Gill, who
was ejected for the first time in his 10-year career, and the Nets
thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just got to let people know that your teammates and you
aren't going to be shoved around, and that's part of the reason I
did it too,'' said Gill, who had 16 points and 6 rebounds. ``We
hadn't had that much success against the Cavaliers for a long time,
and sometimes we may have to establish that we're not going to take
anything. We have to establish some type of toughness.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight seconds after jawing with DeClercq, Gill was
ejected. DeClercq gave Gill a hip check, and Gill faked throwing an
elbow, provoking an official, Rashan Michel, to give Gill a second
technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was great how Kendall stuck up for his
teammate,'' Feick said. ``The team chemistry is definitely a lot
better now than what it was at the start of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything is better. Whereas the Nets' offense was all Marbury
when the Cavaliers beat them by 97-90 on Nov. 3, they had great
balance on Wednesday night. Nine Nets had scored, including four in
double figures, by the time they took a 57-47 halftime lead. They
opened the second half with a 16-8 run that put them ahead by 73-55
midway through the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury followed Van Horn with 23 points, 7 assists and 5
rebounds, while Kerry Kittles added 17 points and 5 assists. The
balanced scoring outweighed Cleveland's two-headed offense of Shawn
Kemp (36 points) and Wesley Person (22 points, 6 of 6 on 3-point
attempts). The Cavaliers fell to 11-10 despite shooting 56.2
percent from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're slowly returning to form,'' Gill said.

WHEN FISHING TRIPS TURN INTO ER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dave Guthmiller and his uncle were on a two-day
trip aboard the sport-fishing charter vessel Mustang out of San
Diego. At daybreak in Mexican waters, Guthmiller's uncle got up
from his bunk, then passed out and could not be awakened.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was an emergency-room physician aboard, the
doctor hadn't brought his medical bag on the trip, meaning there
was little he could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skipper called the Coast Guard,'' said Guthmiller, 38, of
San Bernardino, ``and they responded with a rescue helicopter. They
lowered a medic onto the boat to assess the situation and decided
to evacuate my uncle in a litter basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergencies happen on fishing trips, but care will vary from
crew to crew. And with today's litigious society, many times a
crew's hands are tied. If you're concerned about how medical
emergencies are handled on your boat, it's best to ask ahead of
time.
</P>
<P>
   Guthmiller, whose uncle turned out to have had a severe reaction
to medication he was taking, gives high ratings to the Mustang's
skipper and crew for being prepared for the emergency. Aside from
the benefits of occasionally having an off-duty medical
professional aboard, certified ships' masters do possess basic
first-aid skill, at least in theory.
</P>
<P>
   To apply for the appropriate ``masters'' operating license, the
Coast Guard requires that all applicants provide proof of
completing an approved first-aid course within the past 12 months,
as well as a current and valid cardiopulmonary resuscitation
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coast Guard and the sport-fishing industry do an excellent
job of enforcing the standard,'' said Richard Helgren, owner of
Helgren's Sportfishing in Oceanside.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, a passenger aboard one of Helgren's boats
suffered a heart attack. There was a doctor aboard, but the man
couldn't be revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were off San Clemente Island at the time,'' said Helgren.
Even though he was clearly beyond resuscitation, the Coast Guard
came and got him; they were there in minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sport-fishing landings go a month or more without as much
as a fish-hook injury. But it better be more significant than that
to hail the Coast Guard because, officials said, they won't come
out for injuries that are less than life-threatening, unless
there's trauma or shock. Something like a broken bone by itself
won't bring a chopper overhead; the ``patient'' must be stabilized
to endure the boat ride home.
</P>
<P>
   But some things can be done without the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Putnam of Rancho Cucamonga was on a seven-day charter in
Mexican waters in June 1998 when a passenger was found unconscious
in a companionway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quickly determined that he had been eating (the
seasickness medication) meclyzine by the handfuls and that a
swollen prostate had shut down his urinary output,'' Putnam said.
``Having had a similar problem, the (vessel) carried a catheter
kit.''
</P>
<P>
   A doctor was on a nearby charter vessel. The physician was put
into a dinghy and motored over to the other boat, where he
catheterized the ailing man and otherwise stabilized him. The crew
made quick time back to San Diego, where the man was taken to a
local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there likely will always be anglers who feel
crews don't do enough in emergencies, especially when it comes to
seasickness; some crews aren't particularly sympathetic. The truth
is, their efforts are limited by today's legal environment.
</P>
<P>
   Though the threat of litigation has made many skippers reluctant
to do much more than hand out Band-Aids, passenger safety and
well-being is still a captain's primary responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gotten to the point where we have passengers sign
waivers before we will pull out a fish hook,'' said Helgren, ``but
I can see that day coming.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of fish hooks _ a skipper's most frequent
first-aid challenge after seasickness _ if one is lodged in a
sensitive place, like around an eye, Helgren's skippers won't try
to extract it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a special way of removing fish hooks from hands,''
Helgren said. ``We turn the person so he's facing away, have him
close his eyes, grab his wrist and squeeze it hard. Half the time,
we've removed the hook and the guy is still standing there with his
eyes closed, wondering when it's going to be over.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Hey, you can open your eyes, it's out,' we have to tell 'em
sometimes.''

computer files or e-mail messages, according to the American
Management Association. That number, based on a survey of more than
1,000 human-resources managers at corporations of varying sizes, is
up from 35 percent two years ago. The monitoring is necessary,
employers argue, because of the changing nature of the workplace.
Supervisors must keep tabs on which workers are wasting company
time by surfing to entertainment Web sites, which ones are sending
e-mail messages that create a hostile environment for women or
members of minority groups, and which ones are distributing company
secrets or jamming their networks with bulk e-mail. Balancing that

   HIPPIE-THRONE (San Francisco) _ She is no longer a lithe hippie
goddess. But as she sits by the fire in her rhinestone-encrusted
living room, the colors quivering, it's clear that the spirit of
Lotus Carnation still dwells inside Lois Anderson, 72. It was
Lotus, as she was known in the late 1960s _ as opposed to Lois, now
a part-time librarian _ who created The Throne (1973), a
resplendent creation born of acid and epoxy, designed to transport
the sitter into another realm. ``We saw patterns everywhere,'' she
recalled the other day, lounging barefoot. ``We sat and listened at
the feet of every Indian guru, glommed on to every microcosm and
macrocosm, then we looked at their art. I got up one morning and
just like you say `I think I'll have a ham sandwich for lunch,' out

   RANCH-HOUSE (Houston) _ These days, ranch houses are an
endangered species. Once the revered symbol of postwar prosperity,
these rectangular houses, with their rec rooms and picture windows

this one neighborhood, at least 100 ranch houses have been torn
down in the last five years, replaced by today's dream: the

will relocate six young Americans to a dwelling that's not so much
far from home as it is deep. They will live for a week in the
bowels of Times Square as a kind of survival squad, in case the
worst-case scenarios of the millennial Jeremiahs come true. That

   NUNNERY-ROCKIES (Virginia Dale, Colo.) _ For a moment, Sister
Ancilla Armijo seemed like any proud new homeowner. Looking
heavenward, she swept her hand across the towering, domed ceiling
to the skylight windows of the new chapel here, and extolled the
virtues of simplicity. She scoffed at suggestions that stained
glass be installed where there are now views of snowy mountaintops.
``Why do we need those things?'' she asked. ``The land is
beautiful, the building is beautiful _ it just lifts you up to
prayer.'' In this most dramatic American setting, where the Great
Plains meet the Rocky Mountains, a vision of the most improbable
sort is materializing: a 21st-century Benedictine abbey. Last
month, Sister Ancilla and the 20 other nuns of the Abbey of St.
Walburga moved into the nunnery, which was designed and built for
them here in northern Colorado. By Mindy Sink.

KINGS SUFFER SECOND STRAIGHT ROUT

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kings coach Andy Murray has said all season there is
nothing to be learned from losing. He better hope he is really
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Murray better hope that the team he watched get crushed on
back-to-back nights is not the one he was hoping to take to the
playoffs for just the second time in the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   He better hope that all the Kings lost in Wednesday's 8-3 rout
by the New York Rangers was their innocence.

   ``When it happens on one night, you just say it was a fluke and
you move on,'' captain Rob Blake said. ``When it happens in two
straight games you have to wonder what is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Kings were blown out 7-1 by New Jersey on Tuesday and
then again by the Rangers on Wednesday, it was hard to believe they
came in with the best road record in the National Hockey League.
Most of the season, they have been among the elite in the NHL's
Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Now that seems trivial. Not so is the Kings' four-point lead
over the Mighty Ducks in the Pacific Division. A week ago that
number was 10.
</P>
<P>
   But if there was anything more absurd than the final score it
was that the Kings outshot New York 48-31 and even scored two
power-play goals.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was such a disaster that Murray, whose coaching style
usually is scripted to the minute, wasn't sure whether he would
call a practice today. The team, which plays lowly Chicago on
Saturday, was scheduled to arrive back in Los Angeles at 3 a.m.
That is unless he made the players walk home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing you saw was a team that didn't play desperate,'' Luc
Robitaille said. ``We are a team that is not good enough not to
play desperate every time we hit the ice. When we don't play like
this is our last game, teams will blow right by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Just plain losses might have been understandable. The Devils
were coming off their worst loss of the season, 3-1 to the very
beatable Edmonton Oilers. The Rangers came in 3-0-1 after a
miserable start.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils might have played extra hard for assistant Larry
Robinson, who was fired by the Kings after last season. Many Kings
players have said their problems last year stemmed from Robinson's
lack of structure.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's loss, the Kings stayed overnight at their hotel
in New Jersey. They met after the game for a team meal and meeting.
Murray said Wednesday he thought the team had moved on. But before
leaving for the 45-minute bus ride to Madison Square Garden,
third-line left winger Craig Johnson was asked if the team had put
New Jersey in its rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer numbers don't even explain Wednesday's mess. The Rangers
scored six goals in the first period, including five in a
five-minute stretch. For the second straight night, starting
goaltender Jamie Storr was pulled after one period.
</P>
<P>
   And on New York's first three goals _ two by Todd Harvey and one
by Tim Taylor _ came after the Rangers blew by Kings' Ian
Laperriere, Ziggy Palffy and Garry Galley.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey and John MacLean had two goals after entering the game
with just one apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, whose responsibility as team captain stems far beyond
scoring and defense, said any problems the team is having will
remain in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll talk, but this will not get blown out of proportion,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to say when it was 8-0 at the beginning of the third
period. That's when Blake finally scored the Kings' first goal.
Palffy and Marko Tuomainen added two more, but that was not what
the players were talking about after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been very successful this season and now we have to
regroup,'' Storr said. ``We didn't get here by accident, we got
here with hard work. We haven't had that the last two games, but we
know it is the key to our success. It is hard to know why it comes
and goes.''

TROJANS HAVE BEEN DEEP-SIXED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you want USC coach Henry Bibby to grimace, just
ask him about his bench. Or more specifically, why he hasn't used
it much.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby's face tightens, followed by a usually sharp response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, everyone said there was too many guys playing,'' he
said. ``Now, it's `We're not playing enough guys.' Everyone is a
Monday morning quarterback. People say, `Why didn't you
substitute?' Well, you didn't see them play in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why four USC starters have averaged at least 32
minutes through the first nine games, and no starter has averaged
less than 29 minutes this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby might feel undue attention has been paid to his aversion
to substitute at the start of the season, but slowly, things appear
to be changing for the Trojans' bench.
</P>
<P>
   It actually seems to be contributing, and improving, even if it
is taking baby steps in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman center Kostas Charissis earned his first start last
week against Hawaii and played 23 minutes and had six rebounds.
Freshman shooting guard Nate Hair scored nine points and grabbed
five rebounds against Loyola Marymount.
</P>
<P>
   Junior point guard Rashad Jones played 22 minutes and had four
assists against Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly earth-shattering statistics, but Charissis and Hair
each played only seven minutes in USC's first five games. If USC
wants to escape the bottom echelon of the Pacific-10 Conference
beginning next month, it figures the reserves will have to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I found a little niche that makes me valuable out
there,'' Hair said. ``I can give a boost. There's a lot of things
we've heard, like the Trojans have no depth or play only six guys.
But I don't think I've been written off.''
</P>
<P>
   At least not for now. However, Bibby was reluctant to offer too
many compliments following Hair's recent three-game span when he
hit 4 of 8 3-point attempts and grabbed eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do get encouraged, then I get discouraged with him in
practice,'' Bibby said. ``Some guys are gamers. He's not a practice
guy, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's true, but I do come to play,'' Hair
retorted.
</P>
<P>
   As for Charissis, Bibby preferred to redshirt him, but USC's
lack of depth has forced him to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like things he does. He just doesn't know how to play,''
Bibby said. ``He's made great progress. He used to travel the first
three or four times he touched the ball. Now, he's playing like an
American player.''
</P>
<P>
   Charissis, a 6-foot-11 center who grew up Greece, said it has
been difficult adjusting to American rules. While he could hook
players with his arms in Europe, it's not allowed here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the rules in the States are different than Europe. I
don't know how to protect myself from early fouls,'' Charissis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Comments like those could make Bibby cringe, along with the fact
Charissis has fouled out twice in less than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It's one reason that Bibby is trying to seek a balance between
getting young players experience without sacrificing quality of
play. Or, as he bluntly puts it, ``Who would you rather have with a
game on a line? A tired Brian Scalabrine or a fresh Kostas
Charissis?''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine, USC's best all-around player, is averaging 16.7
points and 33.2 minutes this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tired Brian is better than a fresh Kostas,'' Bibby added.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby has even begun to tell USC's players that they shouldn't
get tired so much, because they never play more than four minutes
at a time between TV timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get to rest every two-to-three minutes because you get a
break,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Scalabrine is open to the concept of trying to tough out
the rest of the season playing iron-man minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with six guys you can win,'' he said. ``If you can get
guys to play for 10 minutes, that's pretty good. But people can't
accept being on the bench. You've got to have attitude. That's what
gets you off the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bibby's defense, the one reserve he was counting on _ forward
Jarvis Turner _ sprained his ankle early and is expected to return
to practice next week. He could be playing again when USC opens
Pac-10 play on Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   USC also expects help soon from football player Sandy Fletcher,
who joined the team this week, and is envisioned to be a backup
point guard by next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can go with eight guys or even nine,'' an
optimistic Hair said. ``I think more guys are gaining confidence.''

WHITSITT A ONE-MAN ARMY RUNNING ALLEN'S SPORTS SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Five-year-old Richard Ramsey waits wide-eyed for his
Christmas gifts that have arrived courtesy of the Portland Trail
Blazers front-office staff, who have come to his neighborhood
day-care center as part of an annual community tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Richard's Santa Claus is none other than the head man himself,
Blazers president and general manager Bob Whitsitt, and Richard
rips into a package containing a team sweatshirt as soon as
Whitsitt hands him the gift.
</P>
<P>
   Performing a task Whitsitt has done dozens of times before, the
man known throughout the NBA as ``Trader Bob'' helps little Richard
pull the new shirt over his shoulders and straighten it out for the
waiting cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Blazer!'' Richard proclaims, doing a dance of delight
and high-fiving Whitsitt.
</P>
<P>
   Another fan for life has been brought into the fold, just like
the many players Whitsitt has brought to the Pacific Northwest over
the past 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Six years after he was summarily moved out of his Seattle office
and dismissed from the organization he helped rebuild over eight
years as the Sonics' president and general manager, Whitsitt is up
to his old tricks _ with a few new wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has he retooled a Blazers franchise that has been to
the playoffs 17 times in a row and 22 times since 1970 (second only
to the Los Angeles Lakers' 26 post-season appearances), he's also
taken on the dual job of president of the Seattle Seahawks,
Football Northwest and First &AMP; Goal Inc. Just another rebuilding
project that includes a new $455 million football/soccer stadium
and exhibition center. He's also putting together Portland's new
WNBA expansion franchise and entering into talks to bring an NHL
team to Portland's Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Since Blazers and Seahawks owner Paul Allen chose Whitsitt to
run the sports end of the billionaire's diverse business interests,
Trader Bob has been remade into Tireless Bob, the man who never
stops working.
</P>
<P>
   The trades are still there: 14 trades and 14 lottery players for
the Blazers, including Scottie Pippen, Steve Smith, Rasheed
Wallace, Damon Stoudamire and Stacey Augmon on the 1999-2000
roster. Free-agent signings also abound: Detlef Schrempf, Brian
Grant, Joe Kleine.
</P>
<P>
   But basketball is no longer the only game in town for the man
who became the youngest president in the NBA with the Sonics at the
age of 30.
</P>
<P>
   He's 43 now and somehow manages to find the time to run two
sports organizations, live in two cities _ Portland and Bellevue _
show up for his daughter's high school basketball game, take his
wife to a Bette Middler concert and play Santa to the
underprivileged, all in a 48-hour span.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he's at the Blazers' offices to lunch with the
team's Community Builders volunteers and be filmed by KING-TV's
Paul Silvi. Then it's off to the Blazers game against Minnesota in
the Rose Garden, where he sits under the Blazers basket with owner
Allen, who is on the edge of his seat throughout the close win.
</P>
<P>
   By 12:30 that night, he's home in Bellevue, courtesy of a ride
in Allen's jet, but then he's up by 7 a.m. to head to Seahawks
headquarters for another media interview, a round of paperwork and
a meeting with general manager/coach Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys in pro sports salivate at the chance not to do work.
I don't do that,'' Whitsitt says emphatically, recalling how he
came to leave Sonics owner Barry Ackerley and go to work for Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt had an agreement with the Sonics that he would not do
any work for another NBA team until the 1994 draft was complete,
even though he had been replaced by Wally Walker earlier in the
year. The man who had brought Shawn Kemp, George Karl, Detlef
Schrempf, Sam Perkins and Gary Payton to the Sonics, and who had
been the 1994 NBA Executive of the Year in Seattle, found himself
looking for a new job but not wanting to move his family from
Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, the Microsoft co-founder who bought the Blazers in 1988,
made it all possible, allowing Whitsitt to keep his home life
intact as long as he also maintained a residence in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, Allen wanted Whitsitt to maintain the Trader
Bob reputation for rebuilding aging basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best owner in pro sports,'' Whitsitt says of Allen.
``Whatever you're going to do, it starts at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen's associates speak just as well of Whitsitt, particularly
his ability to handle several jobs in two different but intertwined
sports markets. They remark glowlingly about his ability to
``multi-task'' in Paul Allen's network.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very good at juggling a lot of balls at the same time,''
said Bert Kolde, who represents Allen in a variety of business
interests, including serving as the vice chair of the Seahawks and
the Blazers. ``He embraces technology to stay in touch and
communicate with a lot of people on a lot of things on an ongoing
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   But what caught Allen and Kolde's eye most about Whitsitt was
his boldness as a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is willing to take the bold step and make the bold move. If
you ask me to compare him with other people in the business, there
are some people in some franchises who are afraid to take those
bold steps,'' Kolde said. ``To me, that his biggest difference.''
</P>
<P>
   MOST HATED MAN IN PORTLAND
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt wasn't the Santa Claus that Blazer fans were expecting
when he first arrived in his new position and new city.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a Willamette Week article had fans ripping Whitsitt for
getting rid of popular players such as Clyde Drexler, Jerome Kersey
and Buck Williams. He replaced coaches, Rick Adelman for P.J.
Carlesimo, and then Mike Dunleavy two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the team went from being the NBA's oldest in
terms of average age to the seventh youngest at the end of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the fans came around as the Blazers continued to make
the postseason, culminating in last season's Pacific Conference
banner in the lockout-shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   Sparked by a rare cut in ticket prices going into the season,
the franchise last year averaged 19,462 fans in the Rose Garden,
which is 97 percent of the building's capacity and the fifth-best
attendance in the NBA _ all for a market that ranks 24th in size.
</P>
<P>
   ``With sports, if you're winning, they love you. If you're
losing, they won't invite you over for dinner,'' Whitsitt said.
</P>
<P>
   During all of the changes and through all of the criticism that
met his early years in Portland, Whitsitt was never second-guessed
by his boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk with him, I lay out short-term and long-term. He
has never told me what to do and, carte blanche, what not to do,''
Whitsitt said of Allen's influence. ``He'll be involved all the way
down, but he'll never force you to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the short- and long-term goals are the same: Capture
another championship to match the storybook 1976-77 team led by
Bill Walton and coach Jack Ramsay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Championship teams have to be built. It takes time and it
takes planning. It takes thought,'' Whitsitt says as if it is his
personal mantra.
</P>
<P>
   As an organization, the Blazers have all the ingredients in
place. The team is ranked in the top five in the NBA for revenue,
has one of the league's best practice facilities, draws from one of
the most loyal fan bases in one of the league's most fan-friendly
arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's Whitsitt's main responsibility to put the product on
the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a championship window, and that takes a lot of time
just to get in this position,'' he said. ``But whatever we're
working on, the biggest single asset is our basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   BOB KNOWS FOOTBALL
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt played three sports in college at the University of
Wisconsin-Stevens Point, and was the football team's starting tight
end.
</P>
<P>
   So when Allen was approached in 1997 by government and business
officials about buying the Seahawks to stop ex-owner Ken Behring
from moving the franchise to Southern California, Whitsitt helped
push the ball forward while Allen, a basketball fan at heart, was
somewhat hesitant at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put together something that Paul was willing to buy into,''
Whitsitt said. ``He takes owning a team very seriously. It's more
than just a business. It's a public trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about Paul Allen: If he says he's going to do X, it
means he's going to do 2X. He always goes above and beyond. He is a
Renaissance man.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt first had to convince Allen that he could build that
trust back with Seahawks fans. When he first came to work for the
Sonics, Seattle was a football town that heavily supported the
Huskies and the Seahawks, which had a yearly waiting list for
season tickets, Whitsitt said. But that all changed when Behring
tried to relocate the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times change, but it usually goes back to building a good
product and doing things right,'' Whitsitt said when he looked at
the plight of the Seahawks as a business. ``We didn't have to do a
lot of market research and wonder if Seattle and the whole
Northwest would support an NFL team. We knew they would if the team
did things like they were supposed to do. They didn't burn all the
bridges up there with the previous ownership, they blew all the
bridges up. I think people wanted them to be rebuilt, but just
because Paul bought the team didn't mean that people were
automatically coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   What brought the fans back ultimately was another key move by
Whitsitt: The hiring of Holmgren, someone who is as shrewd and as
driven as the president in the art of the deal and the devotion to
organization. As Holmgren has changed the product on the field, the
fortunes at the gate have changed as well under Whitsitt's
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people now are talking Seahawks, they're wearing
Seahawks, they are believing Seahawks,'' Whitsitt said. ``Every
game is sold out this year for the first time in like a decade,
it's on TV every Sunday and there's a buzz. I'm not telling you
where we are on that mountain yet, I don't know, but I know we're
climbing that mountain and we want to plant the flag on top. We're
not satisfied yet, but we're definitely going the direction we want
to go. To me, that's a huge starting point.''
</P>
<P>
   THE ART OF THE DEAL
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt was 24 when he made his first deal for the Pacers as
the team's assistant general manager, a position he'd obtained just
a couple of years after completing his internship for his master's
degree in sports administration at Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers had chosen Clark Kellogg as their first-round draft
pick and Whitsitt was pushed into having to negotiate a rookie
contract with a rookie's background in dealing with such
high-stakes situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really have a general manager. We had a lawyer who
was acting as our general manager,'' Whitsitt recalled. ``The
couple things I can remember is that he got a five-year deal for $1
million, when the market was a five-year deal for $2 million. ...
But the fact that we got him under market had nothing to do with
me. That was all the money we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt learned most of the tricks of his trade in Indiana,
where the team was always having financial troubles and struggling
to put fans in the seats and players on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to start with other things and leave money alone,''
Whitsitt said about his philosophy of negotiating with a player.
``You have to start with the human elements _ family, the
organization _ then you layer in money.''
</P>
<P>
   In signing Schrempf away from Seattle as a free agent or
bringing in Pippen after the trade, Whitsitt said he pointed out
that the Blazers have ``the best airplane in the world, the best
practice facility, community, fans, quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all stuff I believe in and it's true. I talk about our
owner. That's the way I deal with athletes, and I always tell them
the truth. They can feel if you're lying to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he's come to accept the ``Trader Bob'' label that is
mentioned prominently in the Blazers media guide, Whitsitt can
envision a day when he sits back and enjoys not working his network
of scouts or flipping endlessly through the channels for another
game in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really like making deals,'' he confesses after talking
about his most recent moves. ``When you make deals, you are making
changes, and we have some marquee changes this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Will they work this time and will they be enough to return a
championship to Portland?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really count W's,'' Whitsitt said as the Blazers, at
17-5 and tied with the Lakers in first place, come into Seattle
Thursday night to face the Sonics in KeyArena. ``I don't feel real
good where we are right now, but I feel the W's will take care of
themselves. ... We're early in the tour and the show's going to get
much better.''
</P>
<P>
   A FAN FOR LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt sees his role as the head of a service company that
answers to the fans, who deserve a quality experience for their
money.
</P>
<P>
   What he can't completely control, he says, is what happens in
``the live theater'' on game days. So even if the home team doesn't
win, Whitsitt believes he has a responsibility to make sure that
the fan doesn't feel cheated by the service or the performance.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he began tinkering with the Portland roster, even
though the team was successful on the court last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's the only game in town, but this organization has put
together a standard of excellence that is a high mark. ... We
recycled the whole team, retooled it, and now we're back in the
window,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking toward a new century, Whitsitt believes sports in the
future will have to become more globalized, which will mean
marketing and distributing the product to world-wide audiences. He
noted that in 1978, when he got into the business, the NBA didn't
even have a marketing department, and every team now has its own
marketing arm, in addition to an entire licensing and products
division at the league level.
</P>
<P>
   But with all those layers of research and personnel, Whitsitt
believes that a successful sports executive should never get too
far removed from what's happening in the crowd that shows up night
after night or in the locker room both before and after the games.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he often works out at the Blazers facility with the
players before games and sits in the crowd to keep his feel for his
audience and customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to stay young,'' Whitsitt said, a back-handed way of
admitting that the NBA's youngest president is feeling a little
older these days. ``You need to know what the young people are
doing and what the fans are all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with both teams appearing to be doing well and the new
stadium due in 2002, Whitsitt is starting to plan a few years in
advance to take his first real vacation since starting the job in
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family is the thing I feel the worst about,'' Whitsitt
says of the difficulties of living between two cities. ``Even when
I was in one market, it was tough on the family life.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, family vacations in the past have had wife, Jan,
daughter, Lily, and son, Sean, enjoying some major attraction such
as Disney World, while Whitsitt spends his time in business
meetings or with scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Where will they go on their next vacation to avoid a similar
fate?
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa to look at elephants,'' Whitsitt said without
hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere where there's not a phone or a deal to be made. Where
there's not a player to be signed.
</P>
<P>
   But don't believe Whitsitt won't be looking.

SEAHAWKS' WOES FRUSTRATE HOLMGREN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Mike Holmgren's biological clock has gone
haywire.
</P>
<P>
   That will happen when you're coaching a team that three weeks
ago appeared to be in total control of the AFC West, but is now
tied for the division lead after dropping its past three games.
</P>
<P>
   That will happen when your remaining three games are against the
Broncos in Denver, where the Seahawks have lost nine of their past
10 games; at home against the Kansas City Chiefs, who have won
three in a row to pull into a tie with the Seahawks; and against
the New York Jets, a game that will follow a coast-to-coast trip on
New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   That will happen when you're coaching a team that never has been
in this situation before, and you're not really sure what to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to sleep and, bang, I wake up at 2:30 in the morning,''
Holmgren said Wednesday of a rude, but not unusual, awakening for a
football coach. ``I'm thinking about the end of the San Diego
Chargers game. You know, the plays we called, what we did, seeing
the ball hit the upright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm mad because I can't go back to sleep,'' he said.
``That's kind of how it is at this part of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is, off the scale doses of sleep deprivation and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   It's called pressure. And in the Seahawks' case it's a
combination of the pressure to perform in these next three games as
they did during their five-game winning streak that has been
followed by the three-game skid; and the ability to generate
pressure on the opposing quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren is attempting to keep things light and upbeat. You
know, the old the glass is half full, not half empty analogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I spoke to the team today, it's not real deep,'' Holmgren
said. ``Really. This is not rocket science. It's football.''
</P>
<P>
   But too many of the players he was speaking to don't know the
formula to succeeding in this type of situation and at this point
in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all new,'' said defensive end Cortez Kennedy, who has
been with the club since 1990 and never come close to sniffing a
playoff berth. ``We've got a lot of guys on this team who have
never been in a position to win it all like this. It's a matter of
knowing how to react and how to respond. Not everyone knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   More pressure. The kind that comes from being the division
leader and having every team you face elevate its game.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shanahan knows the feeling. His Broncos won the Super Bowl
the past two years after going 12-4 and 14-2, and were 13-3 the
season before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really challenging and you look forward to it because you
know you're getting everyone's best shot,'' the Broncos' coach said
during a telephone interview from Denver. ``But you better play
accordingly, because if you don't have 46 guys playing at the same
level, you can lose very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: In the past two games, the Seahawks' defenders
too often have looked more like they're playing the accordion,
rather than accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it's pressure. But in this case, it's a lack of it. The
Seahawks have sacked the opposing quarterback once in the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation that has Holmgren already looking to the
offseason, when he plans to determine if the Seahawks presently
have the personnel to play the style of defense he brought with him
from Green Bay, or if the scheme needs to be tweaked to match the
players who were here to play another style.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we like to do, and we believe it's a very sound
way to go,'' Holmgren said. ``But in fact, are the players capable
of doing it and, two, are they willing? We have to look at that and
see how much of this season was that and how much was, well, we
needed some help in this area or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   But then that's consternation for some other sleepless night.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Holmgren has to find a way to get it done with what
he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to come out with a sense of urgency,'' running back
Ricky Watters said. ``We have to jump on these teams. We're the
same team that won five in a row. We've just got to get back to
that. We were very confident back then and there were a lot of
games we could have lost. But we won those games in the same
fashion that we've lost some of these games. We didn't make the
mistakes in the early part of the season that we've been making. We
have to get back to feeling like we can win any game.''
</P>
<P>
   And then perhaps Holmgren can get back to sleeping through the
night.

SEATTLE'S WNBA TEAM GAINS AN IDENTIY IN DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MEREDITH BAGLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle's WNBA team may not yet have a name, but head
coach Lin Dunn introduced her first six players Wednesday after the
league held its 2000 Expansion Draft.
</P>
<P>
   Like a wise player, Dunn took care of the ball first, choosing
experienced guards Edna Campbell and Sonja Henning with her first
two picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get my backcourt first,'' Dunn said. ``It was
tough to do with four teams picking, but I got who I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who will play shooting guard, played three seasons
with the Colorado Xplosion in the ABL before joining the Phoenix
Mercury last year in the WNBA. The 5-foot-8 Campbell started 24
games for the Mercury, averaging 9.6 points per game and shooting
.376 from three-point land.
</P>
<P>
   Henning won a league title last season with the Houston Comets,
starting all 32 games for the two-time champions and averaging 4.0
points per game. A four-year starter for Stanford and graduate of
Duke Law School, the 5-6 Henning had a .444 field goal percentage
last year. Before joining the Coments, Henning played under Dunn
with the Portland Power in the ABL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonja is an elite athlete,'' Dunn said. ``She is a tremendous
defender and led the league in turnover ratio. I was holding my
breath that she'd be available for us, and was surprised that she
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell ,29, and Henning, 30, bring valuable maturity and
leadership to the Seattle team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a blend of young and veteran players was a priority of
ours,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   With her other picks, Dunn chose guard Angela Aycock from the
Minnesota Lynx, Yugoslavian center Nina Bjedov from the Los Angeles
Sparks, Phoenix forward Toni Foster, and guard Charmin Smith from
the Lynx.
</P>
<P>
   Aycock, a 6-2 guard or small forward, played for the Seattle
Reign from 1996-98. A familiar face for local fans, the versatile
Aycock averaged 8.7 points per game for the Reign.
</P>
<P>
   Another former Reign player, Kate Starbird, was drafted by Miami
in the first round, and subsequently traded to the Utah Starzz for
a player and a future draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kate Starbird was absolutely in our mix,'' Dunn said. ``She
was gone by our second pick, but I wish her the best of luck. We
will continue to have interest in anyone connected to Seattle, the
Reign or the University of Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   A reserve center behind Lisa Leslie for the Sparks, the 6-6
Bjedov gives Seattle an inside presence. Bjedov averaged 16 minutes
per game in Los Angeles, shooting 52 percent from the floor and 42
percent behind the arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know many players her size that can post up and hit
threes,'' Dunn said. ``But I know I'm going to start taking lessons
in Yugoslavian.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-1 Foster, a teammate of Campbell's in Phoenix, brings
mobility and range to the small-forward position. Foster was a
Kodak All-American at Iowa and earned Big Ten Player of the Year in
1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   Charmin Smith is another ex-Portland Power player who spent last
season in Minnesota with Aycock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the core,'' Dunn said. ``We want an athletic team that
can run and press, and be versatile all over the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased to have a face for our new team.''
</P>
<P>
   All 16 teams will participate in the WNBA Draft on April 25, and
Seattle will pick ninth in each round. In addition, more ex-ABL
players will be available to teams through free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look for college players that will fit into our
up-tempo aggressive style of play,'' Dunn said. ``And we will also
focus on the free agents who are older and more veteran players.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking over her draft-day efforts, Dunn was exhausted but
excited for the team's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we have great players on this team, but we have
some great role models for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Seattle will open its inaugural season at KeyArena in
mid-May. The team will play a 32-game schedule, which should be
finalized by the first of the year. ... Seattle leads expansion
teams with 7,100 season ticket pledges, and Dunn hopes to have
10,000 season ticketholders by the team's opening tip-off.

RUSH, BRUINS HAD BEEN WARNED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like all UCLA athletes, suspended forward JaRon
Rush has been warned repeatedly that taking money or gifts from
sports agents could jeopardize his college eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with his letter of intent 20 months ago, Rush has read
and/or signed at least nine documents acknowledging NCAA rules
governing agents and the potential penalties, which range from
suspension to loss of amateur status.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to take preventative steps with education, but there
are no guarantees,'' said Bruins coach Steve Lavin, who declined to
discuss the Rush situation.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, a sophomore from Kansas City, has been suspended
indefinitely by UCLA for possible violation of NCAA rules. Sources
close to Rush said he accepted between $200-300 in cash or cash
equivalent (meals, shoes, etc.) from Los Angeles-based sports agent
Jerome Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley has denied involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Teams using players who violate NCAA rules face a plethora of
penalties: forfeiture of victories; loss of revenue; and reduction
of TV appearances. In extreme cases, teams are barred from playing
in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA suspended Rush before concluding its investigation because
it didn't want to risk using an ineligible player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agents are the biggest problem facing college athletics
today,'' Pac-10 commissioner Tom Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's education process reflects that concern.
</P>
<P>
   It begins when recruits sign letters of intent and financial aid
agreements, which outline the terms of their eligibility and
amateur status.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA also sends the ``Guide for the College-Bound
Student-Athlete'' to high schools throughout the country. It
states: ``NCAA rules don't prohibit meetings or discussions with an
agent. However, you jeopardize your college eligibility if you
agree (orally or in writing) to be represented by an agent while in
high school or college.... Also, receiving any benefits or gifts by
you, your family or friends from a player-agent would jeopardize
your college eligibility.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA requires all athletes to read and sign a statement each
year that explains NCAA regulations. Its athletes also sign a
code-of-conduct form and write their initials next to 13 points,
including agent-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   Men's and women's basketball players are required to sign
affidavits before the NCAA Tournament stating they have no
agreements with, and have not accepted money from, agents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, UCLA compliance director Rich Herczog outlines
pertinent NCAA rules for each team before its season begins, and
NCAA rules are posted on UCLA's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try our due diligence to deliver (the information) in a
manner they can hear,'' associate athletic director Betsy
Stephenson said. ``It's an ongoing process that exists in the
normal course of a student-athlete's career.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the documents and affidavits, Lavin uses
real-world methods to warn his players about agents. Last year,
when Rush was a freshman, a spokesman from the Drug Enforcement
Agency lectured the Bruins on drinking, gambling, gangs and agents
_ the fringe elements that pervade big-time college athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin also brought Ronnie Lott, Jerry West, Rafer Johnson and
two former Bruins, Mitchell Butler and Darrick Martin, to Pauley
Pavilion last year to speak to the players about proper conduct.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA and USC are in unique positions among major colleges: They
feature dozens of potential pros in a city teeming with agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only so much time in the day,'' Lavin said. ``But I
think UCLA's on par with the top programs in terms of education and
compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is also examining Rush's relationship with former AAU coach
Myron Piggie, who is under FBI and Internal Revenue Service
investigation for tax evasion and fraud, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Rush testified about Piggie last month before a Kansas City
grand jury; he did not have legal representation. His testimony
prompted the FBI and a U.S. attorney to inform UCLA of possible
NCAA violations involving Rush, Piggie and Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Rush won't play Saturday against DePaul or accompany the team to
Hawaii next week for a three-game tournament. A source said the
investigation could last at least a month.

MARINERS CLOSE TO DEALS WITH SASAKI, MCLEMORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Having failed to land a closer in trade talks with the
Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets, the Mariners are close to
signing Japanese free agent closer Kazuhiro Sasaki. The club also
is finalizing details on a contract for leadoff hitter Mark
McLemore, formerly of the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki, 32, the all-time saves leader in Japan, was in Seattle
Wednesday to complete a physical. His agent, Tony Attanasio, said
the sides were ``very close'' to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners tried to acquire Scott Williamson from the Reds and
Armando Benitez from the Mets in potential deals for center fielder
Ken Griffey Jr. Now they apparently will sign right-hander Sasaki,
who had bone chips removed from his pitching elbow last summer, to
be their closer. Jose Mesa, who saved 33 games last year but was
erratic while doing so, has been mentioned in trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   Attanasio also represents McLemore, who met with Mariners
officials at the winter meetings in Anaheim, Calif., on Monday.
McLemore flew to Anaheim _ to his agent's and the Mariners'
surprise _ after learning the club had raised questions about his
weight.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore, whose primary position would be left field, agreed to
include a weight clause in his contract. The sides have agreed on
terms of a deal, and the only thing to be worked out, Attanasio
said, is the language of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' pursuit of former Anaheim starter Chuck Finley,
however, has ended. The club will make no further contract offers
to Finley, who is strongly considering Cleveland, but the M's are
still hopeful he will accept their last proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we understand it, he's contemplating,'' said Lee
Pelekoudas, Mariners vice president for baseball administration.
``I know we've worked very, very diligently for the better part of
three weeks and we've done everything we can.''
</P>
<P>
   If Finley does not sign with Seattle, the M's may accelerate
their pursuit of free agent Texas starter Aaron Sele, a Poulsbo
native.

ROMAR FOUND PIECES IN PLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the fall of 1996, when rookie coach Lorenzo
Romar walked into the Pepperdine locker room for the first time,
seven players were waiting for him _ just over half a normal
roster.
</P>
<P>
   They barely knew how to practice, much less win. They had no
passion. Romar knew it wouldn't be easy; the Waves had won 10 games
the previous year. It was quantum physics.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Romar's the rookie coach at St. Louis.
Compared to Pepperdine, it's basic multiplication.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a building situation,'' he said. ``Pepperdine was
rebuilding. There wasn't anything there. We had to teach those guys
to work hard and care about winning. They were pretty much just
going to school. That's not the case here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Billikens were in the NCAA Tournament two years ago.
They have talent, although it's not NBA talent. They have solid
fundamentals, courtesy of former coach Charlie Spoonhour. They have
a huge fan base (15,000 per game) and, as of Sunday, they have a
huge victory over in-state rival Missouri for Romar's resume.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a botched rebound against Kansas State, Romar
couldn't have imagined a better start to his St. Louis tenure. His
family likes the area. The weather's been tolerable. The
administrative support is solid, and the Billikens are 5-2 with one
eye on the NCAA Tournament and one eye on a brutal upcoming
schedule that includes Cincinnati (tonight), Dayton and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that sold me on the program, I'm still sensing,''
Romar said. ``I liked the conference (USA), the opportunity to win
on a national level, and the support in the community. That hasn't
changed. We'll have 21,000 (in the Kiel Center) for Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys were 15-16 last year under Charlie. They've been
taught how to play sound defense. They're unselfish. They have high
character. We don't have any lottery picks, but they're all
Division I players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Billikens beat Air Force in Romar's debut. They've handled
UNC Asheville, Southwest Texas State and Alabama, which is coached
by Mark Gottfried, Romar's former cohort on Jim Harrick's staff at
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The Billikens would have beaten Kansas State but for a
mishandled rebound in the final seconds. They lost to Louisiana
Tech, then, before 25,000 in the Trans World Dome, they outlasted
Missouri in the teams' first meeting in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game, we wanted to win,'' said Missouri's first-year
coach, Quin Snyder. ``The rivalry. The city. It meant a lot to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how much it means for Romar, he can't say.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps, ever humble, he won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked that a lot around here this week,'' he said.
``I think (recruits) are more concerned if you go to the NCAA
Tournament. When you go recruiting in July, they won't remember
this. But, in that Missouri is the more accomplished program, it
does help us get established.''
</P>
<P>
   Big week: Romar wasn't the only former UCLA coach to record a
major victory last week. Georgia's Jim Harrick had two: A few days
after defeating Georgia Tech, the Bulldogs rallied from a 13-point
deficit with nine minutes left to beat then-No. 18 Wake Forest at
the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs have won five in a row, the last three by a total
of seven points, and they've shown more heart than Harrick's former
team did against Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had an unbelievable week,'' Harrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Singing the bluegrass: Kentucky is out of the top-25 for the
first time since the week of Dec. 4, 1990 _ a streak of 164 polls,
and that's the fourth-longest span in history. (UCLA holds the
record, 221 weeks, from 1966-80.) The Wildcats have lost three of
their last four entering Saturday's showdown against Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little confused right now,'' reserve guard J.P.
Blevins told reporters. ``We're looking for answers, and we're not
getting them.''
</P>
<P>
   No answers, but plenty of problems. The Wildcats play one of the
toughest schedules in the nation; center Jamal Magloire, expected
to be their best player, is shooting 38 percent; point guard Saul
Smith (six turnovers at Maryland) hasn't become an elite player;
talented youngsters Jules Camara, Tayshaun Prince, Desmond Allison
and Keith Bogans aren't ready to carry the load.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents better take their best shot this season because the
Wildcats will be awesome in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   In and out: The two best players in the West, Utah forward Hanno
Mottola and Fresno State guard Courtney Alexander, started the
season with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Mottola suffered a partial tear of the medial collateral
ligament in his knee Nov. 16 and hopes to return next week against
Texas. Without him, the Utes have relied on the 3-point shooting of
Jeremy Killion and Alex Jensen. That's good enough against
Washington State and Stony Brook, but it won't suffice against
Texas (Dec. 22) or Louisville (Jan. 6).
</P>
<P>
   Alexander missed six games because of a stress fracture in his
left foot, and the Bulldogs were 3-3 without him. He's played the
last three games (one win) and didn't take long to regain his
touch, scoring 43 points at Alabama-Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Pac-10: Stanford had plenty of reasons to lose to
Georgia Tech last weekend. The Cardinal had just finished final
exams. It was playing on the road, at 9 a.m. body time, without its
best player (injured forward Mark Madsen). In addition, the
Cardinal shot 30.8 percent from the field. How did it survive?
Character, and suffocating defense: Georgia Tech shot 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga guard Matt Santangelo's description of UCLA's zone
offense _ ``They just kind of stood around'' _ speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   How's this for leadership? Oregon State guard Deaundra Tanner
has been disciplined twice in seven games, once for missing the
bus, once for breaking an undisclosed team rule.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona freshman point guard Jason Gardner played 40 minutes
against Michigan State and should get ready for more of the same.
For the second consecutive year, the Wildcats don't have a backup
point guard. Last season, Jason Terry played at least 40 minutes 18
times.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, after a 6-21 season, Oregon removed coach Don Monson
and reassigned him to the golf team. Monson was totally unqualified
and never reported, giving Oregon justification for terminating his
contract. Saturday, Monson's son, Dan, leads Minnesota against the
Ducks. Dan just might have that episode on his mind.

STORR HAS OPEN-GOAL POLICY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Goaltender Jamie Storr got the Kings through more
than a month without many of their top players. Now that they're
coming back, he's falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive night, Storr was pulled after just
one period. Wednesday, it came after allowing six goals in an 8-3
loss to the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just never felt comfortable,'' Storr said. ``I don't know
why. You'd think that after Tuesday's game (7-1 loss at New Jersey)
that we would shake it off and move on. That just wasn't the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings Coach Andy Murray didn't blame Storr for the loss to the
Devils, where he was benched after allowing three goals in the
first period. The Kings played poorly on defense and never gave him
a chance.
</P>
<P>
   This time Murray wasn't so kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to make some stops,'' Murray said. ``We didn't give
him much help tonight, especially the first three goals when the
Rangers just walked in. But we needed more. We made a decision that
he was going to play the whole period regardless of what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Storr, who had allowed two or fewer goals in eight of his first
14 games was NHL Player of the Week in early November after taking
over for injured Stephane Fiset. Even with the lopsided loss at New
Jersey, Storr was 8-4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised that I stayed in after the first three
goals,'' he said. ``But there were a lot of guys suffering out
there and I should be one of them. We're still a team, you know,
even if we have been playing terribly the past two games.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray would not speculate whether Storr would be back in goal
Saturday when the Kings host the Chicago Blackhawks. Fiset has
played four periods the past two games and looks ready to take back
the job he had for the first 14 games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset's right hand, which was injured Nov. 6 and forced him to
miss six weeks, is not 100 percent. But he allowed just two goals
after taking over for Storr to start the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Lappy's lament: Even with their injured stars trickling back
into action, the Kings know the work ethic they bring to the ice
every night will decide their season. That means third-line center
Ian Laperriere is more important than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere was beaten on the Rangers' first goal of the night,
allowing Todd Harvey to walk in on Storr untouched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take responsibility for this game,'' Laperriere said. ``Our
line sets the tone and this shouldn't happen. The New Jersey game
should have been one of a kind and we should have moved on. The
only way you make that happen is start hitting guys. They just beat
us up the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick whistles: Kings defenseman Garry Galley entered the game
with the team's best plus-minus rating (+11). He was on the ice for
four of the Rangers' eight goals. . . . Rangers coach John Muckler
was supposed to be fired last month when his team got off to a
terrible start and had the league's worst power play. Now the team
is 4-0-1 in their last five. ``We seem to be going up the ladder
now,'' he said. ``This is a reward for all the hard work we've
done. That was the best first period we've played all year.''
Actually it is the best first period the Rangers have played since
Oct. 30, 1988, when they scored six goals in a 9-2 victory over
Pittsburgh. . . . Former Dodger Mike Piazza was at the game. He's a
blond now.

WEARY LAKERS BRACE FOR ROAD TESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They're sick, they're sore, and they're just now
getting to the tough part of the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have embarked on their first significant road trip of
the season _ four games in five days, starting with tonight's game
against the Atlanta Hawks at Phillips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   They're not exactly in prime shape to meet their biggest
challenge of the season to date.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper is still suffering from a bruised left quadriceps but
might be needed for big minutes. Glen Rice is still recovering from
an upper-respiratory infection that sidelined him for two days this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else is just nursing the usual bumps and bruises. Coach
Phil Jackson gave his team the day off Wednesday to rest them for
the arduous trip that also includes stops in Minneapolis, Toronto
and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher figures everyone will be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys will get some good rest, get a chance to sleep in
(Wednesday morning), which we don't get a chance to do very often,
and be ready to go on Thursday,'' he said. ``As far as Glen being
sick, he'll get himself back going. Harp's going to drag that leg
all year, so there's nothing new. He'll still be able to go out
there and compete and give us what he can give us.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper said playing four road games in five days, on an injured
leg, ``ain't anything I haven't seen in the past 10 years in this
league. . . . Whatever Phil asks me to do, I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice might not be such a concern. Though knocked out for two
days by a 102-degree fever, he played one of his better games of
the season Tuesday against the Clippers _ 8 for 11 from the field,
17 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the times in the past when I've been sick I've been
able to go out there and play pretty good basketball,'' said Rice,
his voice hoarse. ``I'm going out there realizing that I'm sick, so
I'm a little more focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Moment of truth: The Lakers are sporting an NBA-best 18-5 record
but Jackson has insisted that no assessment can truly be made of
this team until they've gone through an extended road trip. This
one's been circled on the calendar since opening night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with that,'' Fisher said. ``I mean, we know (how good
the team is), but we haven't been on the road, down 10 (points) in
the third quarter and had to fight back. Sacramento was our first
opportunity to be in that situation, and we didn't win. So these
four games will be on the road, we'll be down and everybody will be
against us, so we'll have to figure out a way to stay together,
stay strong and come out with four wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The season is more than a quarter over, but the Lakers have
played just nine road games, and until now, they've only had one
trip that's lasted longer than a day (a two-day trip in early
November).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I agree with Phil, as far as this trip being a very
nice test for us, to kind of see where we are at at this point, as
far as our ability to execute, play together,'' Fisher said. ``You
know, it's tougher on the road. One night you can put it together,
maybe two nights you can put it together. But now we have four
games on the road, and we have to be able to put it together all
four nights.''

BETTER NOT WAIT FOR MUNI AT AMMIANO'S BUS STOP  

</HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT OSTLER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
 
SAN FRANCISCO _ Great, now Muni will never get fixed.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why would Willie Brown want to fix Muni when it's what brings
Tom Ammiano to work?
</P>
<P>
   Willie, despite his wide margin of victory, has to be steamed.
He's one of the most powerful politicians of our times, and he had
to campaign like a madman to beat a guy who should have been a bug
on the mayor's windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if Ammiano hadn't been so scarily liberal, and hadn't
made most of his pre-mayoral-campaign headlines by standing up for
the zinging nuns and against ATM fees.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Supes, Ammiano has been the patron saint of
fringe causes, and still he was able to play Rocky Balboa to
Willie's Apollo Creed.
</P>
<P>
   Now Brown says he's planning to hang onto his grudge against
Ammiano over the Cookie Jar Statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign debate, referring to the FBI investigation of the
city's Housing Authority, Tom said Willie got caught with his hand
in the cookie jar. Brown interprets that as an accusation that he
was on the take.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Ammiano was accusing Brown of getting caught doing the
worst thing a mayor can do when whiffs of scandal filter up to his
office from below: Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Ammiano should have said Brown got caught with his  &LR; head
 &LR; in the cookie jar.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Tom, thanks for the excitement, and good luck catching
your bus this morning.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BITTERLY COLD  &LR; out, it was last Friday night. At the Anchor Brewery
on Potrero Hill, brewer Bill Kiebala was alone, finishing his work,
when he heard a rapping on the rear gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cold and we're locked out of the church,'' someone said.
``Can we come in and warm up until someone brings the key?''
</P>
<P>
   Bill said sorry, but he was busy and he was working alone.
Brewers are notoriously softhearted, though, and he changed his
mind, opened the door and ushered 20 members of the S.F. Choral
Artists Group into the taproom.
</P>
<P>
   The person with the key to St. Gregory Episcopal across the
street never showed, so the group held choir practice for several
hours in the taproom, using Anchor's well-tuned piano, with
refreshments supplied by good old Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Bill even gave 'em a brewery tour, and the singers serenaded the
burbling vats of Anchor Steam.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs a church key when you've got a tap?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE MARRIAGE  &LR; of Albertson's and Lucky has already lost some of its
electricity, notes Cammy Blackstone, wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   She reports: ``On the market sign at the Lakeshore Plaza, some
letters are burned out and it reads `AL E SO S.'''
</P>
<P>
   One rumor is that Albertson caught Lucky getting lucky with
Safeway.

 &UR; HEY, NASA,  &LR; asks Doug Biggs, are you offering a reward for the
return of your two lost Mars-exploration thingies?
</P>

   ``I believe I've found them,'' Biggs says, ``on two pedestals in
front of the Ferry Building.''
</P>
<P>
   City art czar Stanlee Gatti would probably like to post a sign:
``Welcome, artists, to San Francisco _ 750,000 art critics, no

homeless men selling the ``Street Sheet.''

traded for two Street Sheets.

in the little sewing kit in his guest room at the Hilton:
prethreaded needles.

incantations, and whatever cable TV feed they can suck in from that
time zone.
</P>
<P>
   And so on, a new New Millennium celebrated every hour, circling
the globe until 2 a.m., when whoever's left will attempt to
pronounce ``Aloha'' and demand that the globe stop spinning so
fast.

NORTHRIDGE MAKES IMPRESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge was at the center of another
stunning, numbing jolt last Saturday. Did you feel it?
</P>
<P>
   It shook college basketball pretty forcibly, the shockwaves
spreading out from the west like a shiver down Dick Vitale's spine.
</P>
<P>
   They've been talking about it as far away as Tennessee. And in
Eugene they're still sifting through the rubble, looking for
answers as to how the Matadors managed to beat Oregon on its home
court.
</P>
<P>
   The result was jarring, if only because these weren't sitting
Ducks that CSUN toppled 79-77. Oregon has returned three starters
from the squad that graced last season's NIT Final Four and is
widely regarded as an upper echelon team in one of the country's
toughest, tightest conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, McArthur Court is easily one of the toughest
places to play in the Pacific-10. Winning streaks tend to go there
to die. Just ask UCLA, which has lost two of its last three games
on that court.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Matadors haven't cornered the market on upsets.
The college basketball season hasn't even reached the time line and
already we've seen Samford beat St. John's, Northern Illinois
defeat Wisconsin and Kentucky fall out of the Associated Press Top
25.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN, though, is one up on the Bulldogs and Badgers, both of
whom participated in last season's NCAA Tournament. Twice now, the
Matadors have chanted the magic word _ ``teamwork'' _ shaken their
capes and, presto!, a huge win has materialized out of air thick
with hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it would appear the Oregon win was an aftershock to the
temblor of Nov. 30, when CSUN stunned Fresno State 69-66 in front
of a sellout crowd of 10,200 at Selland Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Understand: Fresno State isn't simply Jerry Tarkanian's team; it
was No. 20 on basketball virtuoso Vitale's preseason top-40. The
Ducks graced his list, too, at No. 35.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Matadors, they haven't been this high since the 1996
Big Sky Conference championships when they came within one win of
qualifying for the NCAA Tournament after upsetting Northern Arizona
in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fresno State was the one I was praying for,'' said the
Matadors' fourth-year coach Bobby Braswell. ``Just so the guys
could taste what a hugger is.''
</P>
<P>
   A hugger, for the uninitiated, is the next best thing to hitting
the lottery jackpot and having Ashley Judd present you with the
check.
</P>
<P>
   It's when your heart is racing and time is standing still.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sensation not unlike stumbling out of the dark into
brilliant sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   It's the celebration that ensues when Andre Larry banks in a
jumper over three defenders with the clock ticking down at Oregon
or when the your team opens up an 18-point lead at Fresno State and
hangs on to win.
</P>
<P>
   The hugs and hurrahs are coming fast and furious now, as quickly
as former players can click ``send'' on a congratulatory e-mail or
dial the telephone. There's so much Matador pride it has Braswell a
little misty-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day,'' he remembered preaching to his players as recently
as their 73-59 loss to USC on Nov. 19, ``we're going to get to the
point where you're not embarrassed to wear the Northridge shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Braswell didn't know how right he was. The only red his players
are wearing these days is on their shoes or jerseys, not their
faces. Heck, they aren't even ashamed of clashing.
</P>
<P>
   Senior forward Jeff Parris, junior guard Carl Holmes and
sophomore point guard Markus Carr are the team's designated
leaders. Their responsibilities include leading the Matadors in
stretching and establishing the game-day fashion.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the trio risked the wrath of Mr. Blackwell by
eschewing the black sneakers the team traditionally wears with its
black road jerseys in favor of the red and white sneakers they
usually save for home games.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that helps explain why the Matadors felt right at home in
the roiling sea of green. They kept their composure when the Ducks
held a three-point lead with just over three minutes to play. There
was a timeout and before Braswell could speak, Carr cleared his
throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are NOT going to lose this game,'' he announced.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Carr said of his bravado, ``I felt if I showed
some leadership, it would (resonate) through the team.''
</P>
<P>
   If you saw the movie ``Hoosiers'' you have a pretty good idea
what happened after that.
</P>
<P>
   Larry, a senior who started his career at Oregon, banked in his
improbable shot to put the Matadors ahead by one with 10 seconds
left. Five seconds later, an Oregon player missed a layup and Carr
was fouled.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who had goaded his teammates into believing stepped to
the line and, to his disbelief, missed his first free throw.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, who said he ``was definitely nervous,'' regrouped and
swished his second attempt. In the time it took his second shot to
fall and the remaining seconds to tick off the clock, Carr learned
more about himself and this team than could be crammed into seven
semesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so satisfying, just showing myself I can play with the
big boys and showing people our team can play with the big boys,''
said Carr, who finished with 13 points and eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   The players now believe. But what about CSUN's sixth man? Are
the fans open to being converted?
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest fear is that what the players achieved will go
unnoticed and they'll get discouraged,'' Braswell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors play two games on the road next week, at Oral
Roberts and Texas El-Paso, before returning home to the 1,600-seat
Matador Gym on Dec. 28 to play St. Francis of New York. The law of
supply and demand will be in effect: If the students demand seats
to the game, Braswell will supply the pizzas for those cueing to
get tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to stand at the mall and hand out flyers
(advertising) the game, I will,'' Braswell vowed.
</P>
<P>
   You should know, Braswell's value is climbing faster than area
real estate. If players like Carr keep improving and the Matadors
continue winning, Braswell is going to be harder to keep at CSUN
than a secret.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors long in the shadows of Pepperdine and UCLA and USC,
are dropping their cloak and developing a swagger. When the next
win of significant magnitude comes, don't say you weren't warned. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: NEW LEGAL MEDICINE FOR DOCTORS ONLY
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Dec. 19.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are some 700,000 self-employed doctors in the
United States. They earn, on average, $200,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such typically cushy incomes, many doctors are griping.
It's not about money, they say. It's about health care plans that
jilt their patients to satisfy stockholders. By working in concert,
some doctors say, they would stand a better chance of putting
things back in sync.
</P>
<P>
   But that would break the antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians agree it's time to right the balance. Earlier
this year, the House Judiciary Committee held hearings on a
bipartisan bill that would permit health care professionals to
negotiate collectively with health care plans.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsors say that would bring about an equilibrium in
negotiating power, foster competition and enhance the quality of
patient care, without impacting doctors' duties to offer medically
necessary care.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill, seeks to strike a balance
of his own in the struggle. Says Hyde: ``The doctor-patient
relationship must be preserved, and I am concerned that it may be
diminishing.'' He adds, however, that ``almost everyone's life
would be easier if they were exempt from the antitrust laws.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joel Klein, the government's top cop, says it's all about
greed. The legislation, he maintains, ``would hurt consumers and
taxpayers by raising the costs of both private health insurance and
governmental programs with no assurance that quality of care would
be improved.''
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Eric Holder, the deputy attorney general, who is
married to a doctor, went to the annual meeting of the local
medical society. He heard some horror stories caused by insurers'
bureaucratic bungling. (I know this because I'm married to a doctor
too.)
</P>
<P>
   But Holder didn't budge a stitch. So with a presidential veto in
the offing, the American Medical Association has gone to Plan B: it
has formed a union.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers signed up the first members earlier this month at the
AMA's winter meetings in San Diego. They call themselves Physicians
for Responsible Negotiations, or PRN for short, the Latin
abbreviation for ``pro re nata,'' which is what doctors write on
prescription pads to show that the medicine should be used only as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a funny kind of union. It won't strike or honor picket
lines or link up with other labor groups. Only doctors can join,
but of course you can practice medicine without joining.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't intended to be focused on the almighty buck,'' says
Susan Hershberg Adelman, a Southfield, Mich., pediatric surgeon who
has been named PRN's president. ``So far,'' she adds, ``doctors are
coming to us with stories about their working conditions and how
that impacts their ability to take care of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton turns a deaf ear, the National Labor
Relations Board is listening. Earlier this month, the agency
overturned its own 1976 decision by ruling, 3-2, that interns and
residents who work in private hospitals can join labor unions.

 &HT;    COMING UP: MUCH MORE OF THE SAME
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Dec. 19.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As anyone who once bought an eight-track tape
player can attest, predicting the future of technology is not for
those who embarrass easily.
</P>
<P>
   Still, forecasters keep looking down the road, doing their best
to guess where the new century will take us. While they differ
about what specific tools and toys will shape our tomorrows,
prognosticators do seem certain about one thing: Whatever we have,
we'll have more of it.
</P>
<P>
   We'll have more computers, more televisions, more phones, more
types of food, more kinds of fabric. Because of computer-controlled
manufacturing systems and expanding global trade, the price of
goods will be falling while our affluence will be rising. That
means more of us will have more of everything.
</P>
<P>
   So far, our response to affluence has been to build bigger
houses. Last week, the U.S. Census Bureau released its latest
Statistical Abstract, providing fresh data about how we are
handling our prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the size of the average new home shot to 2,190 square
feet, up dramatically from the 1970 figure of 1,500 square feet. In
1998, about half of all new homes had at least two and a half
bathrooms, up from just 16 percent in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   These bigger houses have allowed us to stack up our shoes,
sheets, shampoos and other possessions. Landfills have absorbed the
rest. Peering into the typical American closet, one might conclude
that we have about all we need.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to material wealth, we ain't seen nothin' yet.
</P>
<P>
   The typical household of the 21st century will have far more
goods, if for no other reason than shifting demographics. As the
World War II generation dwindles in the early years of the new
century, baby boomers will inherit trillions of dollars worth of
cash and goods. Boomers will be bringing into their already crammed
houses their deceased parents' furniture, dishes, pictures, jewelry
and heirlooms.
</P>
<P>
   Then in another 20 years, the oldest of the boomers will start
dying off in large numbers. The peak of this inter-generational
wealth transfer will come in about 2035. Because they gave birth to
fewer children than their parents, boomers will have fewer heirs to
absorb the cascade of accumulated goods that will come tumbling
down.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, younger generations already will be piling up their
own mountains of cheaply produced goods. When the compounded wealth
of the World War II generation and the boomers finally comes to
rest in the chock-full homes of their children and grandchildren, a
nationwide cry may go up: Where are we going to put all this stuff?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this immense wealth of goods will provide Americans with
a chance to help poorer people around the world. Charitable
organizations that can find ways to bundle up our bounty and ship
it overseas might help reduce the wealth gap between First and
Third World nations.
</P>
<P>
   At this time, few organizations are interested in cleaning,
sorting and sending clothes and other goods to poor countries. That
means our castoffs generally bounce from one yard sale to the next
until the landfill claims them.
</P>
<P>
   In the 21st century, our ability to manage mountains of
merchandise may determine whether we will improve the world, or
simply bury ourselves. The ``more millennium'' will be ours to
shape.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: An unanticipated Y2K glitch
 &HT;    (For release Dec. 19, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With guarded anticipation, perhaps a slight sense of foreboding,
I await the arrival of the next thousand years _ give or take a
year. As a good little soldier, I have read everything I could
understand about Y2K, which is not a lot but an effort
nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   But just when I thought I was fully compliant, I found out I
wasn't. Oh, my computer is ready (even though my venerable word
program still thinks it is 1982); the airlines say they're ready to
serve me, the medical records departments indicate full compliance,
the government claims it's prepared, but I suddenly realized that I
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   It was while writing a check to the cable company that I noticed
that the space for the date concluded with 19; as in 1999 or 1901.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but I order checks by the bale, printed
with my name, address and part of the date on it. They're ordered
about 350 at a time. And now they seemingly are out of date _ by a
whole millenary!
</P>
<P>
   Inasmuch as I favor overreaction to most things, I began to
wonder if any checks I write beginning Jan. 1 will be good. Do you
simply cross out the 19 and scratch in 2000? Or is this all a
gambit to have us discard our inventory and buy new checks that
begin the year date with 20?
</P>
<P>
   Obsessed with this nominal glitch in Y2K compliance, I sought
out two banking executives from different banks.
</P>
<P>
   What do I do about the 19?, I asked seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The answers, not in these exact words, were, ``What are you,
nuts?''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the explanations that rattled me. One banker said
that no human being at her bank actually looks at any checks for
less than $3,000; it's one of those computer-driven processes. So
an imprecise date wouldn't mean anything. The second banker told me
his bank doesn't look at any check that is written for less than
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean I can write a check and date it Oct. 12, 1492, or
Dec. 7, 1941 and if it's less than $1,000, it will just sail
through unnoticed?'' I asked the second banking executive.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, pretty much, he responded. Then he cautioned me, while
functioning from his humorist/banker mode: ``But just in case the
check has to be examined for something, say a claim of forgery, you
should know that checks written in 1492 are not honored. In Florida
(where the banker operates) there is a limit of one year on checks
being deposited or cashed.''
</P>
<P>
   All this simply leads to more questions, far too heady for me to
approach at this time of holiday-spirit and spirits. Such as
wondering how banks spot forged checks that are written for amounts
below the guidelines of human scrutiny. Or if I could write a check
now for, say, $387, date it Dec. 19, 2056, and have it accepted by
the seemingly Y2K compliant computer?
</P>
<P>
   As for the known quandary about existing pre-printed 19 checks,
until such time as I get an ominous call from the bank telling me
otherwise, I simply will cross out the 19 and write in 20. It's all
so logical, I don't know why it ever concerned me.
</P>
<P>
   When Y2K flips over in a couple of weeks, and the planet remains
in its orbit, we'll likely wonder why we ever were concerned with a
lot of the stuff that they've been telling us to be concerned over.
</P>
<P>
   You want to panic over something? I'll tell you what to panic
about. Microsoft announced last week that its Windows 2000
operating system for businesses will be shipped to corporate
customers Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be the millennial bug we have been anticipating,
but think of all those businesses that have computers to which we
owe payments. The people who program and operate them will have to
orient themselves to Windows 2000, and if you ever tried to learn
Windows 95 or Windows 98 from scratch, you can imagine what Windows
2000 will be like.
</P>
<P>
   And when things don't happen smoothly _ such as you made a
payment but ``their'' computer didn't record it _ the businesses
usually defend themselves, saying that ``a few bugs need to be
worked out'' in the new system. This could be the situation
beginning Feb. 17, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Those, then, will be the true millennium bugs!

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Yes, Internet, there is a tax collector
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contrary to what Karl Marx expected and Ronald Reagan hoped, no,
the state is not _ repeat: not _ going to wither away. Which brings
us to taxes. Which brings us to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is much urgent mulling going on at high levels and low
over the prospect of applying state and local sales taxes to
``remote'' retail trade _ that is, to catalog and Internet commerce
_ just as they are applied to store sales.
</P>
<P>
   Most state and local governments, it will not surprise you to
learn, are for it. The opponents are more animated and more varied.
</P>
<P>
   They include the usual right-wing foundations, think tanks and
activists formed up ad hoc as the ``e-Freedom Coalition,'' which
really does want to defund government away. The aginners include,
too, of course, many of the businesses that would have to charge,
collect and distribute the taxes and would rather not. And the
la-de-da Internet romantics, who, in a fantasy of perpetual
adolescence, imagine an Internet life forever cut off from the real
world, gravity free, where the only responsibility is to the
gratification of the cruiser's impulse of the moment. Taxes offend
that notion.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, though, this is a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   State and local governments already are losing about $5 billion
in taxes annually to catalog sales, and with Internet commerce
booming they could be losing $15 billion in another three years.
Remote sales hit $2.7 trillion last year, 3.5 percent of total
retail sales, and the Direct Marketing Association figures their
share will double by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   There is simply no good reason not to charge routine sales
taxes. The Supreme Court worried about an undue management burden
30 years ago when it limited catalog sales tax charges to buyers in
states where the seller has a fixed facility, but computer
technology makes broad collection feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The current tax-free status of remote sellers gives them an
unfair, government-sanctioned competitive edge over other
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   And there's an issue of social fairness, though to say so these
days is to be accused of fomenting class warfare. Sales taxes are
inherently regressive, sopping up a bigger part of low incomes than
of high ones. Tax-free remote sales worsen that imbalance,
benefiting shoppers, especially on the Internet, who are on average
far better off than most customers.
</P>
<P>
   A high-level commission is to recommend to Congress next spring
whether the current, legislated moratorium on Internet and catalog
sales taxes should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The 46 states with sales taxes collect, on average, more than 40
percent of their revenue from that source. The revenue funds
schools, law enforcement, park systems and more. If state and local
governments are aced out of an increasing proportion of potential
sales taxes, they will simply have to raise other taxes _ the
property tax, payroll or income taxes _ to make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   After all these years, there still ain't no free lunch, folks.

 &HT;    FBI is getting ready for any millennium bugs
 &HT;    By Wes Hills
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The FBI will maintain 56 24-hour Y2K command
posts across the nation to address any potential federal criminal
violations or national security incidents during the millennium
rollover.
</P>
<P>
   ``While no specific threats have been received to indicate an
increased level of criminal activity, general information has been
disseminated at the national level which suggests the potential for
increased malicious cyber activity as well as potential physical
attacks on the nation's infrastructures from millennial or
terrorist groups,'' said Sheri A. Farrar, special agent in charge
of the Cincinnati FBI division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information concerning such threats or an actual incident
occurring in the southern half of Ohio should be promptly reported
to the Cincinnati FBI,'' Farrar said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that ``while some malicious cyber activity may occur,
the main concern with the Y2K rollover is the possibility of
isolated service outages affecting public utilities caused by the
Y2K date problem in older computers.''

 &HT;    To many of certitude, complexity is evil in and of itself
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The numbers say newspaper readership is declining.
Take a Page 1 story Tuesday in most metro papers in the country and
get a hint as to why.
</P>
<P>
   Slapped down on the nation's doorsteps that morning: complexity,
raw human complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Top story: Surgeon General David Satcher challenges the way we
look at the mentally ill. He estimates that nearly one in five
Americans has suffered from mental illness, ranging from clinical
depression to bipolar disorder, but two-thirds of those stricken
never seek treatment. Either they are paralyzed by stigma, or they
just don't know they're sick.
</P>
<P>
   We've heard about missile gaps, learning gaps, earning gaps.
Satcher's important report demonstrates a perception gap.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans will take this information and become better
informed, better able to deal with a world of complexity. Some will
just cancel their subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   They will crawl into their bunkers to protect themselves from
the commie threat of our age, ``com'' as in com-plexity.
</P>
<P>
   Having someone in Washington point out that clinical mental
illness is far more pervasive than assumed rubs against
assumptions, particularly among the ever-thriving fundamentalist
persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   It is neat and tidy to think that there are good people and
there are bad people.
</P>
<P>
   Don't give us the thesis that many bad people are good people
with an illness that makes them act badly.
</P>
<P>
   Don't go informing us that new-generation drugs can make
miraculous strides with schizophrenics. You're talking about lots
of money in curbing these mumbling street persons (we know they're
simply slothful), more government trying to help people. We say,
each to his own bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly we don't want to get too deeply into this mental illness
stuff because it removes the certainty we take with us in asserting
right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the death penalty. Few people would bemoan the fate of
a sound-minded individual who killed and, knowing what he bargained
for, gets death in return. But what if he were mentally ill?
Insanity is a defense, we say. It also is as uneven as a dart toss.
Certainly the odds of making such a defense stick are far greater
than one in five, which are the odds of mental illness among even
the peaceable.
</P>
<P>
   Move away from crime. That complexity stuff finds other ways to
make life difficult for the devoutly certain. That is why they
often are given to cursing science.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of man is one such area. Is evolution as origin
anti-God? Hardly. It is simply not something that can be elaborated
in one chapter, 31 verses and six days.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution as origin can be as good as the Good Book describes.
It just can't be as concise.
</P>
<P>
   Complexity be gone. And take science with you.
</P>
<P>
   Be gone, these people will say, with scientists studying to see
if homosexuals carry a genetic trait or some other determinant that
makes their sexuality not a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you go equating homosexuality to right-handedness or
brunetteness, the certain will say. That makes things far too
complex and almost impossible to condemn.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that would make homosexuals among the creatures placed
on this earth as is, as was when the creator, to paraphrase Genesis
1, said, ``Behold _ very good.''
</P>
<P>
   I know what the rejoinder to this is: This complexity stuff is
simply a dodge for relativists who won't acknowledge evil, won't
acknowledge sin.
</P>
<P>
   My only question as a newspaper man: Is inquisitiveness among
God's gifts to man, or is it original sin?

 &HT;    Please, let the songs escape from my skull
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Nearly every morning I wake up with a song
in my head. Most times it's a song that I can't stand. The other
morning it was ``I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus'' _ the version
sung by some screechy-voiced kid, maybe little Michael Jackson. It
took a hot shower, several cups of coffee and an Sausage Egg
McMuffin to drive that rascal out of my skull.
</P>
<P>
   I've even awakened to hear ``Achy, Breaky Heart'' lumbering
between my ears. Yeech. I consider Billy Ray Cyrus to be the
antichrist of country music. Reminds me of a line from a Chris Wall
tune, lamenting the death of Keith Whitley several years ago:
``Lord, if you'll just send back Keith Whitley, we'll give you
Billy Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen to that.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, apparently I am not alone. An informal survey of
co-workers and acquaintances indicates that just about everybody is
dogged with tunes they can't stand running through their head. For
some, it's radio or television jingles. For others, it's snatches
from nursery rhymes. It's almost always something annoying.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, one person I talked to said what first runs
through her head each time the alarm goes off is, ``Ohmigod, it's
morning already.''
</P>
<P>
   Which could make a pretty good country song.
</P>
<P>
   Pondering this, I went to the Internet, figuring there is bound
to be a Web site devoted to people who are tormented by the songs
in their heads. There is at least one Web site for any conceivable
subject in the universe. Finding it is a trick, since Web sites are
added by the bejillions each day. I read somewhere that even the
best search engines can only scan 16 percent of all the sites on
the Web. I consider this a good thing, since any search now
invariably brings up about 17,000 possible sites. If all sites were
being searched, that number would increase sixfold.
</P>
<P>
   I have this theory about the World Wide Web. It was created by
the moguls of television and radio, with limited help from the
print media. They sat around one day, worrying about how they were
going to increase their budget numbers the following year. One of
them said, ``Let's use the old, stuffy Internet, long the domain of
universities and the military, to create a new medium on which any
20-year-old can found a company that loses millions of dollars at
the same time its stock value escalates at alarming rates. We'll
make the Web so huge and hard to find stuff that these companies
will have to advertise on television and radio, and in newspapers
and magazines to let people know they're on the Web. Otherwise
they'll never find them.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Click on the television tonight. Every other
commercial is about a place to buy stuff on the Web. The sites
almost certainly aren't making any money, since it apparently is
illegal to make a profit on the Web unless one specializes in
photos of naked women. But the TV station or network selling the
commercials is making a killing. The price of a 30-second spot at
the next Super Bowl is rumored to be $3 million, which will buy
about 20 shares of your typical dot.com.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, after about 15 minutes, I found
songinmyhead(at)listbot.com, which is devoted to people who wish to
complain about melodies in their medulla. The entry page says:
``Join this list if you always have songs buzzing around your head
and you'd like to annoy/amuse other people by sharing them.'' There
are about 300 entries, certainly no indicator of a worldwide
problem but enough to make you wonder:
</P>
<P>
   _ Why would anyone create a Web site devoted to songs in your
head? Does this person have a real job?
</P>
<P>
   _ Are they selling stock yet? The only effective cure for
exorcising an annoying jingle or song from my head is to tune to a
commercial radio station. Listening to instrumental or classical
music, as I usually do, won't do the trick. But crank up a Top 40
station with big-haired, high-pitched rock stars singing something
unintelligible, or some drugstore cowboy crooning about his horse,
dog, mama and pickup truck, and ``I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus''
magically disappears from my brain.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, then I'm stuck humming ``Bubba Shot the Jukebox,'' or
some such nonsense. At least I'm not alone. The Internet has proven
that.

 &HT;    Far-right group attacking Republicans
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Tommy Merritt, a Republican state representative
from Longview, was intrigued recently by a letter asking him and
wife Janet to ``change the future of Texas. We need your help in
finding a qualified conservative candidate for state
representative.''
</P>
<P>
   Merritt read on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This letter is sent to you because you are a proven civic
leader who has voted in several recent primaries. You live in a
district that has strong Texas values and votes for conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet your State Representative, Tommy Merritt, has received
only a 58 percent rating on conservative issues according to our
respected analysis of critical votes,'' the letter continued.
``This is a failing grade. Rep. Merritt does not vote for the
values of your district.''
</P>
<P>
   Merritt and several other incumbent Republican state
representatives have been complaining to their Democratic
colleagues that the far-right groups that once campaigned against
the Democrats are now campaigning against some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The letter to Merritt was written on the stationery of Free PAC,
the political arm of the Free Market Committee. It was signed by
Richard Ford, founder and operator of both groups, who says he is
paid benefits but no salary. Ford's letter asked Merritt to help
find a candidate to run against Merritt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is your district represented by someone who does not vote
according to the wishes of the folks back home?'' Ford wrote. ``We
think it's because the one expert who knows your district hasn't
been asked _ you! We are asking, pleading, begging for your help.''
</P>
<P>
   And money.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ford should not count on receiving help or money from
Rep. Merritt.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was chagrined about the letter, too: ``That was a mistake _
meaning he should not have received a letter from our mailing
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford said he'd specifically told the direct-mail operation to
take Merritt's name off the GOP voter mailing list. But he had no
apology for opposing Merritt.
</P>
<P>
   Merritt charged that Ford's group styles itself as a
free-market, free-enterprise outfit, but ``predominantly used
social issues as a scoring mechanism.'' Merritt was marked down by
Ford's group for votes on parental notification on abortion _ he
voted to allow a pregnant girl to tell a member of the clergy
rather than a parent before getting an abortion _ and for a
hate-crimes bill championed primarily by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Bonnen (R-Angleton) says the same ultraconservative
opponent he beat in a runoff in the 1996 GOP primary, Diane Hensley
of Alvin, is readying to run against him again. In her first race,
she received backing from far-right groups such as Free PAC and
another political action committee associated with San Antonio
multimillionaire James Leininger, Bonnen noted. Leininger
co-chaired Free PAC's dinner in October.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Eppstein, a Fort Worth-based political consultant, advises
more than three dozen Republican legislators, including Merritt and
Bonnen. He said many contributors to special interest groups such
as Free PAC or the Eagle Forum and the Christian Coalition, which
make abortion their main issues, are well-meaning. But some of the
positions the groups' leaders devise are out of step with
mainstream Republicans, from Gov. George W. Bush on down, Eppstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hue and cry of Republican voters and officials all over
the state of Texas is `We want a broader, more inclusive Republican
party. We do not want litmus tests,''' Eppstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Merritt, a businessman who belongs to groups such as the Texas
Association of Business and Chambers of Commerce, was alerting some
people and organizations who have sent money to either the Free
Market Committee or its PAC, saying they ``should examine very
closely the members and what their true agendas are.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ford's ham-handed effort against Merritt may already be
backfiring. For instance, Vaughn Aldredge, AT&AMP;T's governmental
affairs vice president, wrote Ford to complain _ and pledged
continued political support for Merritt from the ``AT&AMP;T PAC and
hundreds of AT&AMP;T managers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Aldredge said AT&AMP;T would no longer
contribute to the Free Market Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Land Commissioner David Dewhurst is a financial supporter of
Free PAC who was listed as vice chair of the group's biennial
banquet honoring its ``Top Ten'' percent conservative Texas
legislators. Dewhurst ducked when asked his feeling about Ford's
group opposing Merritt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to have been a sponsor of the dinner for
conservative legislators held each year by Free PAC, but I'm not
consulted in PAC activities or decisions,'' Dewhurst said through
spokesman Richard McBride.

<P>
   NAPLES _ What I love about Naples is how people there appreciate
a good sunset. A half hour before the sun goes down the march to
the sea commences.
</P>
<P>
   Old folks lug tattered beach chairs and crystal wine glasses
from nearby homes.
</P>
<P>
   Young folks pedal bicycles across the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-aged fitness fans jog along the shoreline. A gaggle of
kids follow, pointing at birds and covering their eyes to avoid the
glare.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd gathers at the city pier and yet it's so quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Watching it reminds me of a scene in the Nicolas Cage-Meg Ryan
movie, City of Angels, where the angels meet at the beach at
sunrise to listen to the music of the spheres.
</P>
<P>
   No sphere music to be heard here. Clumsy-looking pelicans
crashing into the waves for fish provide what little noise there
is. You can't help but feel at peace.
</P>
<P>
   And peace is always a good feeling after a tiring afternoon of
gallery hopping and shopping on Fifth Avenue and Third Street
South.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense that people in Naples would honor something as
beautiful as the setting sun. Clearly, they enjoy handsome artwork
_ there are no less than 31 art galleries in the city. Many are
around Fifth Avenue and Third Street South.
</P>
<P>
   Both tony shopping areas are within easy walking distance of Inn
by the Sea, the bed-and-breakfast my husband and I visited.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you be misled by its moniker, the inn isn't on the
shoreline, but three short blocks away _ close enough for a walk or
bike ride.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1937, the five-room inn, one of Naples' first guest
houses, is on the National Register of Historic Places. It has a
tin roof, wooden cove siding, ceiling fans and brass and iron beds
and yellow pine floors and ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   We stayed in one of the two upstairs rooms, the Bokeelia Suite.
(Rooms are named after barrier islands. Others are Gasparilla,
Sanibel, Captiva and Keewaydin.) Painted pale yellow, the walls in
our suite had pink, blue and yellow floral wallpaper borders. There
were tropical watercolor prints on the walls, wooden blinds on the
windows, and several baskets of sea shells placed around the suite.
The sitting room had a day bed, wicker chair and coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   While cozy, we found the quarters a tad confining and we didn't
like having to go across the hall to use the bathroom, which was so
tiny we could barely close the door without scraping the sink.
</P>
<P>
   But we had a good time at the Inn by the Sea, partly because we
met some fun folks in the living room and talked for hours, and
partly because the place has plenty of old Florida charm. The
ceramic fish on the sidewalk at the house's entrance was cute and
we loved the backyard orange tree, ripe and ready for picking. The
citrus fragrance alone enchanted us.
</P>
<P>
   Engaging, too, were the inn's owners, Maas and Connie van den
Top, who bought the place a few months ago. Connie, a former art
dealer who lived in Paris for several years, and Maas, from
Holland, give the place a bit of international flair.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast, served in the dining room, included orange juice,
rolls, muffins, cereal, yogurt and fresh fruit. The only
disappointment was that with all those ripe oranges outside, the
juice came from a carton.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise, this little B&AMP;B was a great place to get some
R&AMP;R.

 &HT;    There's an appropriate tome for every type on your list
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're still searching for a holiday gift for your
significant other, distant cousin, persnickety mother-in-law or
weird uncle, perhaps you should consider a book. They're easy to
wrap, returnable and, best of all, you don't have to worry about
getting the right size. You do, however, need to match the
recipient with the right book.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have an aunt who has saved every issue of The Saturday
Evening Post? Give her ``Norman Rockwell: Pictures for the American
People'' (Abrams, $45) or the three-dimensional ``Norman Rockwell:
A Pop-Up Art Experience'' (Rizzoli, $18).
</P>
<P>
   Got an armchair adventurer in the house? ``Last Climb: The
Legendary Everest Expeditions of George Mallory'' (National
Geographic, $35) by David Breashears and Audrey Salkeld is
realistic enough to give him frostbite.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer heft, you can't go wrong with ``Century: 100 Years of
Human Progress, Regression, Suffering and Hope 1899-1999''
(Phaidon, $49.95). This 13-pound volume is the best-selling gift
tome of the season, says Katie Parker of the Atlanta-based Chapter
11 Discount Bookstore chain. The 1,120-page book by Bruce Bernard
has more than 1,000 photographs, including rare images of the
Beatles performing in Liverpool's Cavern Club and Teddy Roosevelt
visiting Booker T. Washington in 1901.
</P>
<P>
   Other brisk sellers are ``The Greatest Generation Speaks''
(Random House, $19.95), Tom Brokaw's follow-up to his best seller
``The Greatest Generation,'' and ``LIFE: Our Century in Pictures''
(Bulfinch, $60), a collection of images from the fabled magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Books that have won awards or been featured on television are
always in demand, Parker says. ``Ha Jin's `Waiting' took off after
he won the National Book Award. Oprah's books still do OK, but a
lot of readers say they're getting a little tired of this
emotional, redemptive fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no ``Cold Mountain'' this year, but Kent Haruf's
``Plainsong'' (Knopf, $24) is an excellent substitute. Set in a
small Colorado town, the novel is the story of how two teachers,
two young boys, a couple of quirky ranchers and a pregnant high
school teenager converge to form an extended family.

   Cameraman's memoir: Lens on the best
</P>
<P>
   By the time he died earlier this year at the age of 96, Freddie
Young was universally regarded as the greatest living
cinematographer, if only for his three collaborations with David
Lean (Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago and Ryan's Daughter).
</P>
<P>
   Seventy Light Years (Faber and Faber) is a delightful memoir by
Young, whose greatness as a cameraman was equaled by his decency as
a man. Although reputedly difficult with his crews, Young was
renowned for his kindness when dealing with young cinephiles and
writers. I found this out when I contacted Young a few years ago
for a biography. Although in a wheelchair, he was still painting,
enjoying his life, and was immensely helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy Light Years is an urbane Cook's Tour that details
Freddie's beginnings in silent movies (lots of spectacular detail
about the methods of developing and tinting film that made the
silent movie experiencee such a sensual delight) through a long
lifetime of doing what he loved.

<P>
   A Gathering of Spies concerns itself with a female Nazi spy
trying to smuggle the secrets of Los Alamos out to the Germans in
the last days of the war. OK, it may not sound like much, but then

making music worthy of the name. Playing scales, for a writer,
means reading. Is there any real writing that has no reading behind
it? I don't think so.''

<P>
   A WINDOW FACING EAST, by John S. Tarlton. Bridge Works; 176
pages; $22.95
</P>
<P>
   MARGRIM
</P>
<P>
   View of affair from `Window' lacks complications
</P>
<P>
   The dangerous age used to be 30, or, if you were being generous,
40. But we're living longer now, and boredom is rampant, so all
ages are dangerous, especially the late 40s, as Gatlin is finding
out.
</P>
<P>
   Gatlin is a financial planner in Baton Rouge, and he is 47 going
on 16. He can't understand why his beautiful wife Sarah is no
longer interested in reenacting the Kama Sutra with him. She wants
to take long trips, he wants to work; she wants to have kids, or
adopt, or something, and he just doesn't see the point. Basically,
all he wants to do is have sex, and all she wants to do is
something other than have sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere along the line, we allowed the incidence of our sex
life to become a strategem in the ongoing repartee. We punish each
other with fussy abstinence.''
</P>
<P>
   All this is bad enough. What makes it well-nigh unbearable is
that Gatlin's best friend is engaged in strenuous extramarital
exercises that can lead to cardiac arrest, divorce court or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we grow older,'' Gatlin tells a friend, ``we learn that sex
is only a minor figment in the grand scheme of things. Like the
notion of a good night's sleep, the idea of ever getting filthy
rich, sex is something we leave behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like you're not getting any,'' says a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's having fun but Gatlin, so he begins thinking about
having an affair of his very own. A client, perhaps. A perfect
stranger, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   A Window Facing East is not a bad novel, but it's not exactly a
good novel, either. The premise has a certain residual interest _
last time I checked, male menopause was still a growth industry _
but John Tarlton's novel lacks narrative energy, as well as
spiraling complications.
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain amiable charm on view, and some hard-won
wisdom about divorce. ``Bitter is only a word,'' says Gatlin's
friend Cliff about his ex-wife, who found him entwined with his
secretary and didn't believe his explanation that he was
demonstrating Roman wrestling. ``What Marian really wants is to run
a large vehicle over my dead ass. Then back up and run over my ass
again.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a sense that this novel is an interlocking series of
skits that don't quite coalesce into a compelling narrative whole.
Take, for instance, an unlikely episode where Gatlin and a friend
present a theatrical performance in a prison that nearly provokes a
riot.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that Philip Roth has written this novel
out of rage, John Updike has written this novel out of confusion
and Richard Ford has written this novel out of sorrow. Tarlton's
particular contribution is to combine a good old boy's sexual angst
with some unappetizing whining.
</P>
<P>
   To tread on such familiar territory, more needs to be tucked
into the baggage than Tarlton has provided. This is a twice-told
tale that needs more energy, or surprises, than Tarlton seems
willing to give it.

<P>
   LAWRENCE: The Uncrowned King of Arabia, by Michael Asher.
Overlook Press; 418 pages; $35.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Asher fits a description of the ideal biographer of
Lawrence of Arabia. A British Arabist who lived with a Bedouin
tribe for three years, he followed T.E. Lawrence's trail with a
dog-eared copy of The Seven Pillars of Wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The sort of thing that irks him is having to approach one
battlefield anachronistically in a Land Rover because there isn't a
camel for rent in that part of Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Asher sees beauty where others see rocks. But he doesn't share
Lawrence's Victorian romanticism. Lawrence formed a mental image of
the noble Arab _ beautiful, manly, untamed by effete civilization _
long before he met his first Arab. Then he went out and found some
who fit his image.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's current reputation rests on Peter O'Toole's portrayal
in the 1962 David Lean epic Lawrence of Arabia and on Seven
Pillars, which at one time was displayed in literate homes even if
the owner never quite read it all the fustian way to its end.
</P>
<P>
   The film, even at an extreme length, compressed a lot. It began
with Lawrence in British intelligence in Cairo, omitting his time
as an archaeologist in Syria. That's where he employed the Arab boy
who was the love of his life (platonic but highly charged, Asher
believes). And the film left out his odd childhood with a
self-effacing father who was a big landowner before running off
with Lawrence's strong mother, a governess.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Pillars is part fact, part fiction. Lawrence wrote of some
adventures that never happened. His mystique rests partly on the
oddity that the parts that reflect credit on the author generally
are true, and he invented the parts that tend to discredit or
embarrass him.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence cut a dashing figure in 1916-18, but the reasons have
misted over with time. It was World War I, but he didn't fight
Germans in the trenches of France. Rather, he fought Germany's
allies, the Ottoman Turks, in what is now Syria, Israel, Jordan and
Saudi Arabia, all under Turkish rule at the time. His mission was
to organize the desert tribes against their overlords to aid the
British war effort.
</P>
<P>
   He went beyond his mission by trying to make his mental images
come alive in an Arab nation. The Turks were run out of the area,
but Arab nationhood is still a sometime thing. Lawrence organized
it around the Hashemites, who were protectors of Mecca. The Saudis,
another tribe, protect Mecca now, and the Hashemites rule way up
north in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The post-Lawrence history of the area is at least as amazing as
his three-year run to fame. But it lacks the compelling figure of
Lawrence himself.
</P>
<P>
   Asher excels on this background. He is the rare Lawrence
biographer who gives the Arabs in the Arab Revolt the attention
they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   On Lawrence himself, Asher is of many minds. He admits up front
that he still finds his subject elusive after following him all
over Arabia, on camelback when there was a camel to be rented.
</P>
<P>
   One feat he attempted to copy was crossing the Sinai Desert in
49 hours, as Lawrence had done to report his victory at Aqaba. The
Howyatat, who live there, told Asher it couldn't be done. He gave
them the old ``What? Are you not the men your fathers were?''
argument and got two guides to go with him and his wife (!) on the
trek.
</P>
<P>
   After a day, they were 10 hours behind Lawrence's pace, and one
of the guides was panting and groaning. Asher called it off. Later,
at the British Museum, he discovered the pocket diary Lawrence kept
at the time. Lawrence had given himself a 24-hour head start before
counting the 49 hours.
</P>
<P>
   As George Bernard Shaw said, Lawrence was ``no monster of
veracity.'' Asher also doubts the story about the first man
Lawrence shot, supposedly to avoid a tribal feud. There is diary
evidence that the victim was alive afterward. Even worse for the
myth, Asher raises doubts about whether Lawrence was ever captured
and sodomized by the Turks.
</P>
<P>
   So what's left? A very strange Englishman who, with the
unlikeliest of armies, waged one of the most magnificent campaigns
in military history. The story gets along perfectly well without
the part Lawrence made up.

 &HT;    Some advice on giving books as Christmas gifts
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Books make the best Christmas (birthday, too, in
fact) gifts for a number of good reasons. That is, if the recipient
of your gift can read and, especially if he or she likes to read.
And even if he or she isn't a particularly avid reader, the right
book might turn the person into just that, and that would make it
the greatest gift of all, since you probably can't give happiness
or lifelong good health.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Which book is the right book to give to that
special, or not so special, person?
</P>
<P>
   No one can make that choice for you, but following are a few
books discussed here during the year that might give you a little
help in making this important choice.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, of course, the age of the giftee has a lot to do with
the choice of a giver's book selection. But there was one that came
out this year that might take care of that special person
regardless of what age he or she might be _ if they are above the
age of Happy Meals, that is. I'm speaking of a book titled
``Holes'' by Louis Sachar (Farrar, Straus and Girouux, $16), which
to my considerable surprise, won the National Book Award for
``young readers.'' I'm no young reader by any stretch of the term,
and I enjoyed this book immensely.
</P>
<P>
   A critic named Marvin Hoffman has written that trying to tell
what ``Holes'' is about is no easy task ``for a story with as many
elements as a fine watch, all arranged to mesh so precisely as to
tell perfect time.''
</P>
<P>
   Another recent book that would make a fine Christmas gift,
especially for someone who likes folklore and Texana told with
professional and nostalgic skill, there is ``Walter Benjamin at the
Dairy Queen _ Reflections at Sixty and Beyond'' by Pulitzer
Prize-winning novelist Larry McMurtry.
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry has never been easy to get close to personally, so this
book of essays about his life and times growing up in and around
the small West Texas town of Archer City is about as close as most
people will get to a McMurtry autobiography. It is fascinating for
that and a number of other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Another book now on bookstore shelves that should interest
serious readers and thinkers is Barbara Kingsolver's ``Poisonwood
Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kingsolver fans, this new one may be something of a
surprise, but, if you stick with it, a pleasant surprise. It isn't
as simple and straightforward as previous Kingsolver stories and is
set in Africa. And this go-round, she uses a style somewhat
Faulknerian with each chapter told by a different character in that
character's words and accents. But, never fear, she is as skillful
at depicting character as ever, and her story, or stories, are just
as mesmerizing.
</P>
<P>
   For those who like their reading material rather light and
strictly for pleasure, there are new Robert B. Parker, Robert K.
Tanenbaum and Jay Brandon novels, as well as the many older ones
that are now in paperback.
</P>
<P>
   The new Parker adventure about Spenser and his pals is called
``Hush Money'' and is definitely up to Parker's usual high level of
entertainment. If your friend or relative is a Spenser fan (or
likely to become one) this would make a dandy gift.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite as popular yet, but should be, are the Butch and
Marlene novels by Robert Tanenbaum, former New York City assistant
district attorney, whose stories featuring husband-and-wife
attorneys Butch and Marlene, along with their precocious daughter,
Lucy, are my current favorite light reading.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't sampled one of those yet, don't delay, especially
if you love suspense stories with humor and characters you care
about deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Brandon's new one is called ``Angel of Death'' and is set in
San Antonio, Texas, home of the attorney/novelist. It's a good one,
too.
</P>
<P>
   More Christmas gift suggestions new week.

 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Applying liquid eyeliner in a moving vehicle is easier than
getting Trish McEvoy to sit still.
</P>
<P>
   She's a busy woman. Makeup artist to the stars. Developer of a
hands-on, one-on-one system to teach the correct way to apply
foundation and blush. Creator of high-quality makeup brushes. And
the name on a full line of cosmetics, skin care and fragrances.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Palm Beach's Saks Fifth Avenue earlier this month with
a dozen makeup artists in tow, the 49-year-old McEvoy greeted her
adoring, well-coiffed fans; consulted on makeup applications;
polished an assistant's pinky to show off the nail color of New
Year's Eve (gunmetal with platinum sparkles); and buzzed, buzzed,
buzzed through the cosmetics department.
</P>
<P>
   She also fielded quick questions from a reporter whom she
insisted receive a makeup lesson first. Only then did Trish sit
down to dish:
</P>
<P>
   Quesion: I dream of the perfect red lip color. Can you help me
find it?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``Red is like a heel. You should only wear it for
special occasions.'' Especially in bright Florida sunshine, red has
just a little too much oomph for daytime wear, McEvoy says.
</P>
<P>
   What's the biggest makeup mistake that women make?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Not blending properly. ``If I could recommend one
product, it would be our puff, which blends everything on your
face. Let me get one to show you.''
</P>
<P>
   She rushes off and returns with a simple white puff. It's soft,
all right. Cost: $8.50.
</P>
<P>
   Why do you focus so much on how-tos and hands-on lessons?
</P>
<P>
   ``Makeup can be intimidating. There's so much choice, and people
need guidance in defining their style. Our philosophy is to make it
not intimidating. It's fun. It's a girly thing. It's not surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   What are you wearing today?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Face Kit 3, Model's Choice lip color (a natural-looking
beige) and Lip Liner 17 (a bronzed brown).
</P>
<P>
   What's Face Kit 3? The name of a foundation?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``No, let me get one to show you.'' Runs off, returns
with Face Kit 3. It's a rectangular compact holding four shades in
the same color family: Shaper 108 (a bone pink, all-over eye
color), Shaper 101 (a crease eye color in taupey brown), Definer 15
(a chocolate-brown eyeliner) and Allover Face 1 (a neutral base).
Cost: $35.
</P>
<P>
   Which celebrities do you enjoy making up?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``Fran Drescher because she's such great fun. Angelina
Jolie because she's so magnificently gorgeous. And I enjoy taking
care of Madonna's skin care.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Madonna have nice skin?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   You make an average of two personal appearances a week. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``As much as I love working with celebrities, for me
it's really about the woman who doesn't know how to do her own
makeup and wants to learn. I get the most joy out of teaching
someone how to do her own face. You can put a sparkle in her eye
just by showing her a new lip color.''
</P>
<P>
   How much of a threat does online cosmetic sales pose to the
traditional cosmetics counter?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``At the end of the day, the more education and the more
awareness there is, the better.... Most people will go online for
replenishment. But half of buying makeup is the whole experience of
buying makeup. It's a sensual experience.''

 &HT;    Cystic fibrosis has made life a struggle for Courtney and Taylor
Chesney,
 &HT;    but it hasn't shaken their parents' faith.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Florida _ Every night, Bill and Jerri Chesney
tap their children's chests, over and over again, to keep them from
drowning.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney, 8, and Taylor, 5, have cystic fibrosis, a disease that
tricks the body into producing excess mucus, which coats the
pancreas and the lungs, inhibiting digestion and breathing. The
phlegmy superflux must be expelled daily, or the children will be
left gasping for air, like fish on dry land.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 people in the U.S. have the disease, which is
incurable, though its symptoms can be dramatically alleviated with
vitamins and enzymes to enhance nutrition, inhalants to clear the
lungs, as well as physical therapy, like the chest-tapping the
Chesneys perform each night, doctoring their children. The couple
have been married 12 years and live in Stuart. Bill, 37, works at
Florida Power &AMP; Light's nuclear power plant. Jerri, 34, works
part-time at a Christian bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have an evening out with another family, and they'll
call afterward and say: `We got home, put the kids in bed and had
two hours to ourselves.' That never happens with us. We've got the
inhaling and the tapping to do, every night,'' Bill Chesney grins
ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   Faith and the fellowship of their church sustain them. The very
malady itself has strengthened the Chesney family, knit them
together with a powerful bond. The children themselves are
extraordinarily close to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in Philippians 4:13: `I can do anything through
Christ which strengtheneth me.' There's a reason God has given us
this opportunity. It may be a ministry for us to their lives,''
Bill goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the reason is for other children to see them and think:
'Those kids have CF and they've overcome it. If they can overcome
it, I can overcome whatever life sends me.'''
</P>
<P>
   The disease is drawing nationwide compassion and attention. This
Jan. 8, the 33rd annual ``65 Roses'' gala charity ball for CF will
be held in Palm Beach. Last year's event drew singer Celine Dion,
who performed for the audience at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago. Dion's
niece died of the disease, and she is the spokesperson for the
Canadian CF Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Gene therapy offers hope
</P>
<P>
   CF used to mean certain death, often before the child's age
reached double digits. It is transmitted by a defective gene,
isolated and identified in 1989. The gene must be present in both
parents and even then, the disease afflicts only one child in every
four births. More than 10 million Americans _ one in every 31
adults _ have the defective gene and don't know it. Caucasians are
especially at risk: 28 of every 31 people who have the gene are
white.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers lead perfectly healthy lives, until they meet and marry
another carrier and have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no CF on either side of our family,'' Jerri Chesney
says. ``Bill and I both had the gene and didn't know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, gene therapy and powerful new medicines such as
Pulmozyme, and ingenious delivery systems, via benign viruses and
tiny liposomes, have increased life expectancy to 40 and beyond _
by which time there may be a cure, perhaps through gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Jerri is a lively, cheery woman who nonetheless has a catch in
her voice as she recalls how her daughter was first diagnosed with
CF:
</P>
<P>
   ``She was 8 weeks old. She had a terrible cold, and her stomach
was hard, and she was crying all the time. She was so tiny! She
never gained weight easily. She coughed a lot. We took her to the
doctor on Christmas day, and he thought it was just a bad cold. He
said: `Babies' immune systems are very strong. She'll get over the
cold without antibiotics.' So we went home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she went into pneumonia. One lung collapsed, and the
other was full of congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She spent 10 days in the hospital, and they still didn't catch
it. They did CF tests, and it didn't show up. But they sent us down
to St. Mary's hospital in West Palm. They did a follow-up test.
</P>
<P>
   ``They caught it. She tested positive. She had CF. I can still
remember us holding hands in the emergency room. We were just so
baffled by it. We don't know anybody on either side of the family
that has CF. We didn't know a thing about it. We'd never heard of
it, in either of our families.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, with one child already having CF, did the Chesneys choose
to have another child?
</P>
<P>
   ``We prayed over it a lot, believe me,'' Jerri says. ``We wanted
a bigger family. The odds were three to one in our favor, that the
child would be normal. But we knew we were taking a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got pregnant with Taylor, we knew we were taking a
chance. But we did ultrasounds, and he seemed to be developing
normally. We didn't do amniocentesis, because we knew we would keep
him no matter what. We don't believe in abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was also this thought,'' Bill adds delicately, ``that if
we lost one child, we would still have another with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Taylor was born and was immediately diagnosed with CF.
</P>
<P>
   `Why us? Why two?'
</P>
<P>
   The Chesneys accepted the fact stoically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked ourselves: 'Why us? Why two? What's the deal here?'''
Bill says. ``But our church family and our relatives have helped us
get through it. They've been wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were better prepared the second time,'' Jerri says. ``In
some ways, it's almost easier to have them both having it. That way
one doesn't feel singled out. And we believe the Lord has a plan
for them to lead a wonderful life.''
</P>
<P>
   The two children, Courtney and Taylor, come bouncing into the
living room, giggling and only a little shy. They are remarkably
beautiful. Taylor is blond, Courtney is somewhat darker haired,
with a fine oval face and high cheekbones. The illness has
shortened their breath, but in return it has given them an almost
ethereal beauty, chiseled away pudginess and baby fat, modeled
their faces handsomely. They are active, cheerful and only very,
very slightly pale, because their lungs don't absorb quite as much
oxygen to redden their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Percussion, later bedtime
</P>
<P>
   They seem good children, sitting comfortably side by side in a
soft armchair, watching TV, with nebulizer masks on their faces,
inhaling Ventalin and Intol, two powerful anti-asthma medicines.
Quivering mists of vapor form and flee on the inside of the masks
as they inhale the cool, phlegm-loosening fog.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our daily routine,'' Jerri says. ``The kids take
multivitamin pills with every meal, every snack, and enzymes too,
to help them digest. Every morning and evening they do breathing
treatments with a nebulizer. They also take antibiotics and
steroids. Without Blue Cross, the pills would cost $2,500 every
three months. With Blue Cross, it's only $15.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be extra careful in the winter, with all the
northern visitors in the season. They bring down their colds and
flus with them, and you have to keep a sharp eye out for that and
jump on a cold the minute a red flag goes up,'' Bill says.
``Otherwise it can get really bad, really fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most Courtney has missed is eight days of school. She had
a hard time with a cold this year and had to go on antibiotics for
15 days,'' Jerri says.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for the percussion treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Daddy!'' Courtney exclaims and hops on his lap, lying
across his knees face up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, Jerri does this far better than I do. I still have
to use this thing,'' Bill says, showing a doughnut-shaped rubber
O-ring he attaches to his fingers. Jerri needs no such aids; she
has mastered the percussion, cupping her hand just right so that a
soft ``pop'' of air gently explodes each time she taps Taylor's
chest. The young fellow looks dreamily peaceful, enjoying the
rhythmic, gentle blows, watching the television through eyes that
are getting sleepier.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hit them, you sort of tap them with your hand
cupped, to set up a vibration. Sometimes they nod off while we're
percussing them. Sometimes they use it as an excuse to stay up
later. We say: `Time for bed!' And they say: `Oh no, mom! We've got
to do our treatments!' So they get an extra half hour up.
Rascals!''' Jerri says.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I was at a ballgame giving Taylor a treatment, and
some man turned around in the bleachers and asked: `What's that
hammering noise? What are they building back there?''' she laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop! The tapping has to be done on the upper
and lower side, both lungs, four quadrants of the chest, in turn.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is not contagious. The children pose no danger to
their playmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because we have decided to raise them as normally as
we can and not leave them out, they've adjusted very well. When her
girlfriends come over, they'll ask: `Let me tap Courtney,''' Bill
says.
</P>
<P>
   One day Courtney came home crying from preschool. Gently, her
mother asked if the other children were being mean to her. She
nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the illness. I thought it was that she was
being set apart. I asked her what exactly was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it turned out she was having to take the pills in
applesauce, and the other kids thought that was babyish. So she
wanted to learn how to swallow pills without applesauce, and I
showed her. Now the two kids have this competition. Courtney will
swallow her medicine, and Taylor will challenge her. He'll say:
`Look: I can do two pills!'''
</P>
<P>
   When the insidious mucus comes up, it looks clear and runny,
like thick saliva. The two children cough a bit more than other
children do, and have to carry tissues with them wherever they go.
Sometimes, they have a salt-ring around their forehead where
they've sweated. Salty skin is a symptom of CF.
</P>
<P>
   Fatty, salty foods permitted
</P>
<P>
   But one of the odd rewards of the malady is being able to eat
lots of fat and lots of salt. A CF child's body doesn't absorb fat
or salt as quickly as normal, so Courtney and Taylor can eat things
the rest of us can only look at longingly: rashers of bacon,
sizzling eggs, hamburgers, french fries, cake and ice cream _
practically as much as they like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even give them their own salt shakers and tell them to use
them. We also supplement their diets with Ensure,'' their mother
says.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline: ``Yes, we spank them,'' the father says. ``They
don't get off the hook just because they have CF. You've got to set
limits and let them know when you have gone beyond the limits, or
they will grow up with no idea of what the rules are. Sometimes I
just say: `Go to your room and we'll talk.' And that's enough, I
don't have to spank them.''
</P>
<P>
   Regular kids, regular interests
</P>
<P>
   The children enjoy Disney World and Six Flags over Georgia as
much as any children their age would. Taylor is crazy about Batman
and has a Bat-Plane in his room. Courtney likes kickball; Taylor
likes soccer and swimming. They are both looking forward to seeing
Toy Story 2. Buzz Lightyear is a favorite with both. The children
have arguments, mostly over who gets to sit up front in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to the First Baptist Christian School,'' Courtney says.
And Taylor?
</P>
<P>
   ``I go where she goes,'' Taylor says loyally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lifestyle as parents and children is pretty doggone
normal,'' Jerri Chesney insists. ``Neither one of them has ever
been hospitalized again. We've maintained them at home with
treatments. Every three months we go to St. Mary's. Our next visit
is in February.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are really struggling with this thing. We consider
ourselves comparatively lucky. We're getting by. I've got a good
job, with good insurance. Our church family has backed us up
wonderfully. We have prayer chains, one praying for another who
needs it. We get a lot of energy from prayer,'' Bill Chesney says.
``Our hope is that one day, through science, or through the will of
God in a miracle, they will be cured.''
</P>
<P>
   At night, the children say their prayers while their parents
listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courtney prays to God to make her well, to cure her soon. She
has a lot of faith,'' her father continues. ``We actually learn a
lot from the children. Sometimes I hear their prayers at night and
they are so sincere, so confident, so faithful that I think to
myself, `I've got to learn from that.'''

reached double digits. It is transmitted by a defective gene,
isolated and identified in 1989. The gene must be present in both
parents and even then, the disease afflicts only one child in every
four births. More than 10 million Americans _ one in every 31
adults _ have the defective gene and don't know it. Caucasians are
especially at risk: 28 of every 31 people who have the gene are
white.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers lead perfectly healthy lives, until they meet and marry
another carrier and have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no CF on either side of our family,'' Jerri Chesney
says. ``Bill and I both had the gene and didn't know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, gene therapy and powerful new medicines such as
Pulmozyme, and ingenious delivery systems, via benign viruses and
tiny liposomes, have increased life expectancy to 40 and beyond _
by which time there may be a cure, perhaps through gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Jerri is a lively, cheery woman who nonetheless has a catch in
her voice as she recalls how her daughter was first diagnosed with
CF:
</P>
<P>
   ``She was 8 weeks old. She had a terrible cold, and her stomach
was hard, and she was crying all the time. She was so tiny! She
never gained weight easily. She coughed a lot. We took her to the
doctor on Christmas day, and he thought it was just a bad cold. He
said: `Babies' immune systems are very strong. She'll get over the
cold without antibiotics.' So we went home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she went into pneumonia. One lung collapsed, and the
other was full of congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She spent 10 days in the hospital, and they still didn't catch
it. They did CF tests, and it didn't show up. But they sent us down
to St. Mary's hospital in West Palm. They did a follow-up test.
</P>
<P>
   ``They caught it. She tested positive. She had CF. I can still
remember us holding hands in the emergency room. We were just so
baffled by it. We don't know anybody on either side of the family
that has CF. We didn't know a thing about it. We'd never heard of
it, in either of our families.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, with one child already having CF, did the Chesneys choose
to have another child?
</P>
<P>
   ``We prayed over it a lot, believe me,'' Jerri says. ``We wanted
a bigger family. The odds were three to one in our favor, that the
child would be normal. But we knew we were taking a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got pregnant with Taylor, we knew we were taking a
chance. But we did ultrasounds, and he seemed to be developing
normally. We didn't do amniocentesis, because we knew we would keep
him no matter what. We don't believe in abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was also this thought,'' Bill adds delicately, ``that if
we lost one child, we would still have another with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Taylor was born and was immediately diagnosed with CF.
</P>
<P>
   `Why us? Why two?'
</P>
<P>
   The Chesneys accepted the fact stoically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked ourselves: 'Why us? Why two? What's the deal here?'''
Bill says. ``But our church family and our relatives have helped us
get through it. They've been wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were better prepared the second time,'' Jerri says. ``In
some ways, it's almost easier to have them both having it. That way
one doesn't feel singled out. And we believe the Lord has a plan
for them to lead a wonderful life.''
</P>
<P>
   The two children, Courtney and Taylor, come bouncing into the
living room, giggling and only a little shy. They are remarkably
beautiful. Taylor is blond, Courtney is somewhat darker haired,
with a fine oval face and high cheekbones. The illness has
shortened their breath, but in return it has given them an almost
ethereal beauty, chiseled away pudginess and baby fat, modeled
their faces handsomely. They are active, cheerful and only very,
very slightly pale, because their lungs don't absorb quite as much
oxygen to redden their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Percussion, later bedtime
</P>
<P>
   They seem good children, sitting comfortably side by side in a
soft armchair, watching TV, with nebulizer masks on their faces,
inhaling Ventalin and Intol, two powerful anti-asthma medicines.
Quivering mists of vapor form and flee on the inside of the masks
as they inhale the cool, phlegm-loosening fog.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our daily routine,'' Jerri says. ``The kids take
multivitamin pills with every meal, every snack, and enzymes too,
to help them digest. Every morning and evening they do breathing
treatments with a nebulizer. They also take antibiotics and
steroids. Without Blue Cross, the pills would cost $2,500 every
three months. With Blue Cross, it's only $15.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be extra careful in the winter, with all the
northern visitors in the season. They bring down their colds and
flus with them, and you have to keep a sharp eye out for that and
jump on a cold the minute a red flag goes up,'' Bill says.
``Otherwise it can get really bad, really fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most Courtney has missed is eight days of school. She had
a hard time with a cold this year and had to go on antibiotics for
15 days,'' Jerri says.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for the percussion treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Daddy!'' Courtney exclaims and hops on his lap, lying
across his knees face up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, Jerri does this far better than I do. I still have
to use this thing,'' Bill says, showing a doughnut-shaped rubber
O-ring he attaches to his fingers. Jerri needs no such aids; she
has mastered the percussion, cupping her hand just right so that a
soft ``pop'' of air gently explodes each time she taps Taylor's
chest. The young fellow looks dreamily peaceful, enjoying the
rhythmic, gentle blows, watching the television through eyes that
are getting sleepier.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hit them, you sort of tap them with your hand
cupped, to set up a vibration. Sometimes they nod off while we're
percussing them. Sometimes they use it as an excuse to stay up
later. We say: `Time for bed!' And they say: `Oh no, mom! We've got
to do our treatments!' So they get an extra half hour up.
Rascals!''' Jerri says.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I was at a ballgame giving Taylor a treatment, and
some man turned around in the bleachers and asked: `What's that
hammering noise? What are they building back there?''' she laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop! The tapping has to be done on the upper
and lower side, both lungs, four quadrants of the chest, in turn.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is not contagious. The children pose no danger to
their playmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because we have decided to raise them as normally as
we can and not leave them out, they've adjusted very well. When her
girlfriends come over, they'll ask: `Let me tap Courtney,''' Bill
says.
</P>
<P>
   One day Courtney came home crying from preschool. Gently, her
mother asked if the other children were being mean to her. She
nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the illness. I thought it was that she was
being set apart. I asked her what exactly was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it turned out she was having to take the pills in
applesauce, and the other kids thought that was babyish. So she
wanted to learn how to swallow pills without applesauce, and I
showed her. Now the two kids have this competition. Courtney will
swallow her medicine, and Taylor will challenge her. He'll say:
`Look: I can do two pills!'''
</P>
<P>
   When the insidious mucus comes up, it looks clear and runny,
like thick saliva. The two children cough a bit more than other
children do, and have to carry tissues with them wherever they go.
Sometimes, they have a salt-ring around their forehead where
they've sweated. Salty skin is a symptom of CF.
</P>
<P>
   Fatty, salty foods permitted
</P>
<P>
   But one of the odd rewards of the malady is being able to eat
lots of fat and lots of salt. A CF child's body doesn't absorb fat
or salt as quickly as normal, so Courtney and Taylor can eat things
the rest of us can only look at longingly: rashers of bacon,
sizzling eggs, hamburgers, french fries, cake and ice cream _
practically as much as they like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even give them their own salt shakers and tell them to use
them. We also supplement their diets with Ensure,'' their mother
says.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline: ``Yes, we spank them,'' the father says. ``They
don't get off the hook just because they have CF. You've got to set
limits and let them know when you have gone beyond the limits, or
they will grow up with no idea of what the rules are. Sometimes I
just say: `Go to your room and we'll talk.' And that's enough, I
don't have to spank them.''
</P>
<P>
   Regular kids, regular interests
</P>
<P>
   The children enjoy Disney World and Six Flags over Georgia as
much as any children their age would. Taylor is crazy about Batman
and has a Bat-Plane in his room. Courtney likes kickball; Taylor
likes soccer and swimming. They are both looking forward to seeing
Toy Story 2. Buzz Lightyear is a favorite with both. The children
have arguments, mostly over who gets to sit up front in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to the First Baptist Christian School,'' Courtney says.
And Taylor?
</P>
<P>
   ``I go where she goes,'' Taylor says loyally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lifestyle as parents and children is pretty doggone
normal,'' Jerri Chesney insists. ``Neither one of them has ever
been hospitalized again. We've maintained them at home with
treatments. Every three months we go to St. Mary's. Our next visit
is in February.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are really struggling with this thing. We consider
ourselves comparatively lucky. We're getting by. I've got a good
job, with good insurance. Our church family has backed us up
wonderfully. We have prayer chains, one praying for another who
needs it. We get a lot of energy from prayer,'' Bill Chesney says.
``Our hope is that one day, through science, or through the will of
God in a miracle, they will be cured.''
</P>
<P>
   At night, the children say their prayers while their parents
listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courtney prays to God to make her well, to cure her soon. She
has a lot of faith,'' her father continues. ``We actually learn a
lot from the children. Sometimes I hear their prayers at night and
they are so sincere, so confident, so faithful that I think to
myself, `I've got to learn from that.'''

 &HT;    Mayan ruin, Chichen Itza, attracts thousands of tourists each
year
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULUM, Mexico _ A convoy of tour buses lumbers down the dirt
road and sends plumes of dust and diesel swirling in the fresh sea
wind.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting at the curb as the air brakes groan is a battalion of
government guides who promise the new arrivals that soon the
mysteries of the ancient ruins will be theirs for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   Newlyweds on snorkeling honeymoons and vacationers from Iowa
exit the air-conditioned buses, video cams churning. Large patches
of white flesh turned red from the beach and the cruise ship decks
are herded together, assembled into exploratory groups.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient ruins are still a mile away, with dozens of souvenir
stands selling $5 blankets and $20 sculptures lining the route. For
$1, you can ride a well-weathered tram that in another life might
have worked the Disney World parking lot, Goofy maybe. For free you
can walk the rest of the way up the dirt road.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 centuries ago, the great Maya civilization built a
stone fortress on the Yucatan cliffs overlooking what would become
known as Mexico's Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayas envisioned their walled city of Tulum as a spiritual
and commercial center. For their gods, they made temples and altars
of sacrifice. For seafaring merchants, they made pyramid
lighthouses.
</P>
<P>
   Today half the Mayan dream is enduring: Tulum remains a booming
commercial attraction.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely epicenter for an explosive expansion of new tourism,
Tulum has become the day trip of choice for the cruise ships that
anchor daily in Cancun, 80 miles to the north, the gateway to what
is being called the Maya Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   A new four-lane highway completed by the Mexican government
makes the Maya city easily accessible by bus or rental car. On the
information highway, the government uses a glitzy Internet Web site
to tout its Cancun convention center with meeting rooms for 7,500
and a fine Robert Trent Jones golf course. A New York marketing
firm is succeeding in linking two words most American usually
haven't: Mexico and Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   This year, tourism to the Yucatan is up 11 percent over last,
with nearly 2.8 million people visiting the Cancun-Quintana Roo
coast through September. That could reach 4 million by year's end,
double what the area drew six years ago. Most of them (1.3 million)
were Americans. About 35 percent of all Mexico tourists go to the
Cancun coast, according to the National Trust for Tourism
Development.
</P>
<P>
   On a good day, as many as 5,000 tourists will be ushered in and
out of Tulum, filling the 10 acres of stone ruins so completely
that finding a clear sight line for photography is next to
impossible. Environmentalists and preservationists worry that
development has come too far too fast.
</P>
<P>
   ''On one hand, we understand the need for pulling in the tourist
dollars, but on the other is the fear that we may be destroying the
very thing that makes people want to come,'' said Kate Robinhawk of
Centro Ecologico Akumal, a Yucatan environmental group. ''We'd like
the rate of growth to slow down here. But we know that's not going
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo has defended the growth of tourism,
saying that environmentalists are overreacting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a good plan in place,'' Zedillo said recently. ''We
believe it is possible to have economic benefits and preserve our
heritage at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cultural collisions have always been ruthless, reckless and
given to misunderstanding here on the peninsula. When the Spanish
conquistadors came 500 years ago, they asked the Mayas what their
land was called. The Indian people answered with something that
sounded like ''Yucatan,'' so that's what the Spaniards called it.
Really, what the Mayas were saying was ''I don't know what you
mean'' which was perfectly understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Tulum is the only Maya city known to be circled by a wall and
the most impressive built on a sea coast. The most striking
structure is known as El Castillo , ``the castle,'' a pyramid
topped by a small temple sitting on a 40-foot cliff above the white
beach and cobalt blue water. Rare works of Mayan art were
discovered in what is called the Temple of the Frescoes during
excavations by the Carnegie Institution that began in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous and mysterious of the 60 structures is The
Temple of the Descending God, where over the main entrance a winged
deity, flying head first toward the ocean, is carved. The meaning
of the descending god has been debated for decades. Some
archeologists believe it to be a rain god, others think it depicts
an ocean diver or a baby being born. The most radical
interpretation is that the Mayas were memorializing a visitor from
outer space.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists routinely trample atop the stone platform that once was
used for dances, funerals and, yes, human sacrifices. The Mayas
also would bring their babies here when they were five days old and
bind the sides of the heads with two boards; flat, elongated heads
were considered desirable. Today families of iguanas still scamper
as they have for centuries through the gaps between the stone work.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning around 1520, the Spaniards launched a systematic
campaign to destroy the Mayan culture, burning some 2,000 books
that had been written on bark paper. Three books survived: one
contained the Mayas' calendar and remarkably accurate astronomical
calculations; another held a system of mathematics that introduced
the concept of zero and foreshadowed modern computer language; the
third was about religion.
</P>
<P>
   What revelations were lost in the other 1,997 books will never
be known _ a sad reminder, environmentalists say, of the
irreversible nature of rash action.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing we can do about the tourism and the
development,'' said Robinhawk. ''We can educate people how to deal
with it, though. Future generations probably will look back at this
as a tragic period unless we are successful teaching how to
conserve.''

   LATIN-XMASDINNER _ In Latin homes across South Florida, there's
no waiting for the big Christmas dinner _ it's on Christmas Eve, or
Nochebuena. With many variations, Cubans, Spaniards, Puerto Ricans

feast of symbolic and traditional regional dishes, games and music,
and Midnight Mass _ Misa del Gallo. (Norris, Atlanta

   LONDON-COED _ LONDON _ Travel brings an uncle and neice into
each other's worlds, in London: We were at Tiger-Tiger, a
ridiculously popular disco just a few steps from Leicester Square,
the most bewildering tourist hole in all of London. My niece Renee,
a freshman from South Georgia College in Douglas, Ga., who spent
the fall semester at the University of London, was yukking it up
with two of her classmates. Imagine three 18-year-old Georgia
peaches done up in their best Felicity Shagwell outfits. Fresh off
the plane, I was jet-lagged, wobbly, just trying to keep a grip.
And I was about to discover that family resemblances are sometimes
more than skin deep. . . (Brock, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH

   SINGING-MONK _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Giorgio Cebrian, the
singing monk, tours the world, impersonating homicidal fathers
(Rigoletto), mad monarchs (Nabucco), crowned assassins (Macbeth)
and, now in West Palm Beach, a slippery, serpentine diplomat in
this weekend's production of Andrea Giordano's Fedora. He worships
Verdi when he is not worshiping God. He carries a photograph of
Giuseppe Verdi with him in his travels, along with his breviary of
prayers. He speaks sincerely of leading ``a consecrated life'' in a
little hermitage in Siena, Italy, where he will return to live in
quiet contemplation after his magnificent baritone voice deserts
him, as it must someday. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. (Browning,

   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ In the December cold, midnight Mass was more
than a gathering of the faithful. It was always the quietest
service of the year, despite the hushed excitement that accompanied
congregants into a vestibule fragrant with the smell of
frankincense and candle wax. It was what Roman Catholics call a
High Mass, longer and more formal in its liturgy, but on Christmas
it was without the usual Sunday sermon. The Latin liturgy was
audible, but for the most part it was a ceremony conducted in
silence. You could commune with your maker, uninterrupted by human
voices. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 23.

Robert Pinksy's new collection of Americans' Favorite Poems. . .
Home Hickham, the Alabama author of ``Rocket Boys,'' has signed a
million-dollar-plus deal with Bantam for two more books based on
his West Virginia childhood. (O'Briant, Atlanta

   BOOKS-CHRISTMAS _ If you're still searching for a holiday gift

mother-in-law or weird uncle, perhaps you should consider a book.
They're easy to wrap, returnable and, best of all, you don't have

<P>
   GNJILANE, Yugoslavia _ Alongside a two-lane road that winds
through the hills in southern Kosovo sits a walled farmyard with a
cinderblock house at its center.
</P>
<P>
   The steep, forested hills rising all around could be mistaken
for those of north Georgia. Skender Rahimi couldn't get this place
out of his mind even while he was in the safety and relative
serenity of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The house by the road is Rahimi's home. By local standards, it's
no palace, but it's a good solid house and a cause for pride. It
pained Rahimi (pronounced: ``ra-HEE-mee'') to leave it eight months
ago to escape advancing Serb forces. With seven family members, he
made his way to neighboring Macedonia and a refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   His story is a familiar tale of exile and return that is common
among the 800,000 Kosovar Albanians who fled their homeland last
spring during the brutal conflict between the Serb-led Yugoslav
military and ethnic Albanian separatists. The conflict came to an
end after NATO's 78-day bombing campaign forced the Yugoslav army,
police and paramilitaries to withdraw from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   When Rahimi fled in April he left behind his parents, whose
memory haunted him for the months he was away.
</P>
<P>
   Parents hold a special place in Albanian society: Children,
particularly sons and their wives, are duty-bound to care for them.
The idea of sending parents off to a nursing home or even a
retirement village is an unheard of absurdity, particularly here in
the deeply traditional
</P>
<P>
   countryside.
</P>
<P>
   But Rahimi's parents _ both in their 60s, an advanced age in
Kosovo _ were not up to the long journey south to Macedonia. Also,
it seemed unlikely that Serb soldiers would harm them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived with them more than 40 years,'' Rahimi said a on
recent day in the house's sitting room over cigarettes and cups of
strong Albanian tea. ``I must care for them now.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the effort to transfer refugees out of overwhelmed
Macedonia, Rahimi's family was airlifted to the United States and
ultimately to Atlanta. America wasn't his first choice _ he had
requested Sweden or Norway to remain closer to home _ but he was
intrigued when he saw the destination on a list in the refugee
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is an odd fantasy to people in this part of
the world. Few have visited it, but America is always with them in
movies, sitcoms, music and endless stream of consumer products.
Yet, it remains a distant place. ``It is somewhere for other
people, that's what we always thought,'' he said. ``Before, I
couldn't have an impression. The biggest impression I had was that
Albright and Clinton were helping us to get freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, after a brief stay in New Jersey, the family arrived in
Atlanta and were housed in an apartment complex near Hartsfield
International Airport. Rahimi spoke not one word of English, and
his children had learned only a little more in school. None had
been to a city as big as Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In time, they made a life. From some Bosnians he met, he learned
where he could get familiar food (he didn't care much for the
American fare he sampled, with the exception of pizza). From
Vietnamese emigrants he met at work, he learned survival skills.
</P>
<P>
   But his most powerful memory of Atlanta is a thousand little
generosities given by an American named Mike _ Rahimi can't recall
the odd sounding last name. ``I still think of Mike and walking
around Atlanta,'' Rahimi recalls, first with a smile and then with
a waver in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gaertner, a Catholic Social Services volunteer, assisted
the Rahimis in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm thinking if I could ever help him as I was helped,''
Rahimi says, pausing without ending the sentence. ``They were very
good people in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he loves his native Kosovo deeply, Rahimi would have
liked to have stayed in America. He harbored a powerful desire to
see his five children educated _ a difficult challenge in the
uncertainty of a war-torn province. His younger son, Flamur, caught
the computer bug but has returned to a place where he has no access
to one.
</P>
<P>
   And at 41, Rahimi was prepared to embark on a new life in the
strange but promising land.
</P>
<P>
   Then he received a phone call. He was told that his mother was
sick, perhaps mortally ill. His father was despondent, perhaps
losing his mind. His house in Gnjilane has no telephone and it had
become virtually impossible to get reliable information on his
parents' conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In September he decided it was his duty to return to Kosovo.
However, his eldest son, Mentor, wanted to stay in America. Mentor
turned 18 on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me 'You're sending me to Kosovo. Where I can't
study, where I can't make a life,''' Rahimi recalls.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife agreed to let their son stay. ``So, he will
finish school there (in Atlanta) and maybe he can work there.''
Rahimi says, smiling. ``Now Mike is his second father.''
</P>
<P>
   After saying this, Rahimi looks at his younger son and one of
the three daughters who returned with him to Kosovo and then to his
wife. Briefly, they seem to share in the emptiness of Mentor's
absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult,'' Rahimi says after a minute or two. ``But now
he's grown up and he's living his life. It would be harder now to
have him here and to be unable to give him the school he needs now.
That would be too much for me.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned home in September, Rahimi was overjoyed to find
the house undamaged. About 100,000 houses in Kosovo were damaged in
the fighting, half of them beyond repair. He had assumed the worst.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Bathie, will never forget his return. She was
standing on the front porch. ``I looked at the gate open,'' she
recalls. ``And then I saw Skender's face, the face I never thought
I would see again. I thought I was dead before and now I'm alive.''
</P>
<P>
   He was relieved to find his parents alive and reasonably
healthy. It was all he had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   While his home and immediate family was spared, things weren't
so good for everyone. Five cousins were dead. Many houses were
destroyed. The mosque down the road was a pile of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   And with winter coming on hard, there will be plenty of misery
to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Rahimi thinks a lot about Atlanta and his son. He wonders if he
will ever see either again. When he wants to talk to Mentor, he
walks about five miles to use a telephone. But it's not the same.
</P>
<P>
   He hands a visiting American a handwritten note and a shopping
bag of cassette tapes to take to Atlanta. ``These are his
favorites.''
</P>
<P>
   Life in Kosovo doesn't allow much time for reverie. He and his
wife have four children and two parents to care for.
</P>
<P>
   Rahimi says he's ready for winter. Firewood is stacked neatly
against the wall. The family tractor is parked near the chicken
coops on the front wall.
</P>
<P>
   It is cold the morning Rahimi's wife, Vahide, cooks ``fli-a'' _
a special dish with layers of yogurt and a pasta-like bread _ in a
pan over the open fire. She's in constant motion, stirring the
coals and adjusting the pan to get the heat right. She says very
little.
</P>
<P>
   Rahimi sits on his haunches smoking and warming his hands on the
fire. His mother gazes at him from a few feet away. He wonders if
he was right to leave Atlanta, but he doesn't allow himself to
drift into regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to find the house and the tractor weren't
damaged,'' he says, squinting as the smoke stings his eyes. ``But
life is more important than anything else. This is what I think
now.''

   OPERA-FAN (Rotterdam, N.Y.) _ In 1994, 3-year-old Louis Lohraseb
and his mother were watching World Cup soccer on television when
the announcer said the next program would be a concert by the Three
Tenors. Kim Lohraseb assumed her son would rather hear from the
Three Stooges than the Three Tenors. She was wrong. Louis gave the
classical music singers a listen and fell under the spell of
Luciano Pavarotti. By CHRIS STURGIS.

   MUSIC-MEGADETH (Undated) _ Don't look now metal fans, but
Megadeth lead singer Dave Mustaine _ the man who professes to have
at one time ``smoked, snorted or shot just about everything'' _ is
becoming quite the model citizen. ``The most important thing that
happened in 1997 was the
</P>
<P>
   birth of my daughter,'' says Mustaine, 38, during a tour stop.

   FILM-JEWEL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Yeah, but can she act? As a pop
singer, Jewel is a success. At acting, however, Jewel is a novice.
``Ride With

(``Sense and Sensibility,'' ``The Ice Storm''). By LOUIS B. PARKS.
</P>
<P>
   TV-GAME-SHOWS (Undated) _ We're waiting for the return of ``The
Gong Show`` to prime time. That's how dispirited and jaded we are
about stupid game shows sucking up time and space on the schedule.
If everyone is so fired up about game shows, get the damned Game
Show Network and let us have our sitcoms back. By TIM GOODMAN.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-TAXMAN (Undated) _ The cast of ``The Taxman,'' like
the title character himself, seems out to prove something, and in
this winsome little independent film made by Hollywood insiders,
they do. Co-written and directed by someone who has had success in
Hollywood (Avi Nesher), starring people who have had success in
Hollywood (veteran actor Joe Pantoliano, Elizabeth Berkley and

who invented the phrase in his 1961 novel of that name, died last
Sunday. But as we saw in the next night's debate from Des Moines,
the spirit of his anti-hero, the World War II bombardier Yossarian,
lives on. By CHRIS MATTHEWS.
</P>
<P>
   LEE-SCAPEGOAT (San Francisco) _ Americans across the country
regard the indictment of Dr. Wen Ho Lee on charges of mishandling
nuclear secrets as a travesty of justice, one which affects the
future of all Asian Americans.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Every year it was the same: the congregation sang ``Silent
Night, Holy Night'' as candlelight filled the darkened sanctuary.
Church bells sounded midnight. It was Christmas.
 &HT;    Even when my parents did not attend services regularly, my
family celebrated Christmas by going to church. On Christmas Eve,
we'd have guests, serve a late supper and attend the midnight
service at the local Methodist church.
 &HT;    Guilt, sentimentality, tradition? I never knew why mother and
dad wanted to go. They just did.
 &HT;    I looked to the family Christmas Eve with great anticipation. I
love Christmas carols and hymns. Singing them in an
evergreen-draped church set the mood for the busy days to follow.
Many of my favorite family memories are of that holiday service.
 &HT;    This year, however, I considerd not attending the midnight
service on Christmas Eve. Despite its nostalgic beauty, Christmas
Eve church troubles me.
 &HT;    Finding a seat at a midnight service is like finding a parking
place at the local mall. The church is full of people you've never
seen. Inevitably, someone is sitting in your favorite pew. Folks
know the traditional carols but the liturgy and regular music
confuses them. They don't know how to take communion.
 &HT;    And the minister preaches some predictable sermon about peace
and goodwill, not wanting to offend the ``Christmas and Easter''
crowd. As a regular churchgoer myself, I find the ``big'' Christian
holidays spiritually tedious.
 &HT;    But it's really not even this Christmas religious rush that
troubles me. Rather, Christmas Eve itself troubles me -- it reminds
me of how hard it is to live as a Christmas person all year.
 &HT;    In a way, I envy my ``Christmas and Easter'' brothers and
sisters. Perhaps they can hear about ``peace and goodwill'' on
December 24 and count it only a charming story, a utopian pipe
dream.
 &HT;    Christmas Eve is not a once-a-year proposition. Like marriage,
like churchgoing, it is a tough-minded commitment to bring forth
God's love in the world.
 &HT;    In the Gospel of Luke, Mary announces the coming of God's
kingdom through her child: ``He has shown strength with his arm; he
has scattered the proud. He has brought down the powerful from
their thrones, and lifted up the lowly; he has filled the hungry
with good things, and sent the rich away empty.''
 &HT;    She's not ``Mother Mary, meek and mild.'' She's a biblical
prophet thundering away at the wealthy and indifferent.
 &HT;    Jesus is not just her sweet baby. For Christians, Jesus is the
embodiment of God's vision for humanity -- perfect justice and joy
forever. The prophet Isaiah describes this vision as a New
Jerusalem in which God's people find dignity, prosperity and peace.
There, ``the wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall
eat straw like an ox.''
 &HT;    When the angels announced Jesus' birth, they proclaimed that
God's New Jerusalem had come. The long-expected Kingdom could now
be found among humankind. This child was its prophet, priest and
king.
 &HT;    Every Christmas Eve, we sing that proclamation: ``Hark, the
herald angels sing! Glory to the newborn King! Peace on earth and
mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled.'' It is here! It is here!
The Kingdom of God has come!
 &HT;    But where?
 &HT;    As we step over the homeless on the way to the parking lot? As
we lament wars and rumors of wars? As children starve on this
Christmas Eve? As people die? The divorced and widowed cry at home
alone? Just where is the Kingdom of God?
 &HT;    It is, of course, a mystery how that Kingdom could be here and
not be here at the same time. Some people say, rather
disingenuously, that God's' kingdom is in our hearts. But the
Hebrew and Christian prophets proclaim a real kingdom, a physical
place of union and harmony with God, one another, and all creation.
 &HT;    Living into that reality is the stuff of church (and synagogue,
temple and mosque as well). God's reign is being brought forth and
worked out by God's people. It is commitment to make a more just
world in Gods image, to serve others, to love our neighbors as
ourselves.
 &HT;    We cry, yes. But not out of nostalgia. We cry because it is hard
to live as Christmas Eve people -- believing the truth of the
angelic proclamation and acting on it every single day.
 &HT;    And I will be there on Christmas Eve just as I have always been.
Singing my heart out, teary-eyed, and praying for the grace to do
it better this coming year.

`RISK' FACTORS GROW FOR MEGADETH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Accent marks needed over both e's in resume.) 
 
By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Proud father. Active Christian. College graduate. Political
activist.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like the resume of a presidential candidate? What if I
tell you that this person also can summon the hounds of hell as he
manhandles a guitar?
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now metal fans, but Megadeth lead singer Dave
Mustaine _ the man who professes to have at one time ``smoked,
snorted or shot just about everything'' _ is becoming quite the
model citizen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Megadeth was celebrating a Grammy nomination (the band's
seventh), platinum status for its last album, ``Cryptic Writings,''
and an invitation to play at Howard Stern's birthday party. None of
them rank as the prime event of the year for Mustaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing that happened in 1997 was the birth
of my daughter,'' says Mustaine, 38, from a hotel on a tour stop.
``I never thought I'd voluntarily wipe another person's nose or
(bottom), but being a father comes first with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He needs a little spin-doctoring on the heartfelt sentiments,
but get him fitted for a suit-and-tie and out on the campaign
trail, pronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never hold office. I've done everything a man should
and shouldn't do,'' Mustaine says in rehashing his younger days.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the podium, Mustaine and Megadeth, the band he
founded in 1983 after being kicked out of Metallica, have always
provided a forum for politics as much they have for music. The
group's earliest songs were steeped in anger about Cold War
tensions, Reaganomics and economic disparity in America. Sixteen
years later the Cold War has thawed and cutthroat capitalism has
leveled off. But with its ninth album, ``Risk,'' Megadeth is still
lobbying for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not neglect the fact that Boris Yeltsin still has his
fingers on a nuclear warpile,'' Mustaine says. ``The man very
smugly likes to remind the U.S. about that periodically.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dave Mustaine most mosh pit fans know is a heavy-metal elder
and professional hellraiser. He and James Hetfield of Metallica
stylized many of the gnashing chords that filled the gap between
Black Sabbath and Rage Against the Machine. Bands like Limp Bizkit
and Korn are currently tweaking those riffs, adding bass lines and
rhymes and making a mint on the pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   The private Mustaine is a much more cerebral beast. Sober for
the last four years _ ``I won't even allow my dentist to use
nitrous oxide in my mouth'' _ Mustaine left Los Angeles not long
after quitting drugs and resettled in Arizona. In down time from
the band he earned two blackbelts in karate and became an advocate
for the motor-voter bill that allows people to register to vote
when they renew a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   When the Megadeth members are in the studio or on the road,
Mustaine still plays with a fury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guitarists consider themselves artists stroking the
guitar with a gentle paintbrush,'' Mustaine laughs. ``I consider it
a chainsaw that I whip out to carve a tree stump into a bear. It's
a weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   The anger of a young punk looking for an outlet that propelled
his early days has now evolved into the frustration of a pro-active
adult who still gets pigeonholed as a punk.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at me and say, `Hey, he has long hair so he must
be stupid,''' Mustaine says. ``They would never suspect that I was
a spokesman for the Youth of America for the National Democratic
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Mustaine will have the last laugh. Besides almost guaranteed
platinum sales (1 million albums sold) from a die-hard
international cult of fans, he holds a business degree from the
University of Phoenix. Apparently, biz classes inspired him to
expand his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years he has collaborated with Chaos Comics! to
produce a comic book series, The Cryptic Writings of Megadeth,
which adapts lyrics from the band's songs into the animation. It is
now a coveted collectors' item. ``Crush 'Em,'' the first single
from ``Risk,'' was featured in the movie ``Universal Soldier: The
Return.'' The movie's stars, WCW wrestling star Goldberg and
Jean-Claude Van Damme, even joined Mustaine to film a video for the
song.
</P>
<P>
   As professional wrestling rules prime time and its muscle-bound
heavies are America's favorite soap stars, hitching Megadeth's
wagon to Goldberg might prove to be the equivalent of a can't-miss
stock tip. The band appeared on ``WCW's Monday Nitro'' to play
``Crush 'Em'' as Goldberg stalked the ring. Usually, only Shania
Twain and Ricky Martin can get that kind of prime-time network
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Some die-hard fans might grumble about the group selling out
with such a commercial move. Mustaine has no apologies to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, professional wrestling is more rock 'n' roll than
rock 'n' roll is,'' Mustaine says. ``If someone doesn't want to buy
our albums because of it, that's fine. There are plenty of others
that will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Risk'' as a whole album is also a little bit of a departure.
After ``Cryptic Writings'' was released, Metallica drummer Lars
Ulrich said in an interview that Mustaine needed to mix things up a
bit. Mustaine took him at his word. Instead of a constant guitar
assault, songs like ``Insomnia'' open with docile violins attaching
Zeppelin-inspired Middle Eastern chords and techno-beats to the
chord layers.
</P>
<P>
   And if you missed ``Crush 'Em'' on ``WCW Monday Nitro,'' it
shouldn't be long before you hear it at pro hockey and football
games. Licensed to both the NFL and NHL, the song is giving Gary
Glitter's ``Rock 'n' Roll Part Two'' a run for crowd anthem of
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Glitter?'' Mustaine says of the comparison. ``Now that
wasn't very nice to say.''

`DEEP THROAT' GOES SOPRANO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `DICK'
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``Dick'' is a ``what if'' film.
</P>
<P>
   What if the Watergate scandal bean-spiller known as ``Deep
Throat'' had been two silly teen girls in the wrong place at the
right time?
</P>
<P>
   That frothy premise propels a delightful comedy in which Kirsten
Dunst and Michelle Williams play 1972 gal pals with little on their
minds beyond boys, fashion and innocent idealism.
</P>
<P>
   They live in the Watergate complex, and they take a White House
tour. You take it from there.
</P>
<P>
   The girls not only stumble onto the breakin of Democratic Party
offices, but they also bump into cover-up higher-ups during their
tour _ even the president.
</P>
<P>
   Oblivious to politics, they happily accept the offer of
President Nixon (Dan Hedaya) to be ``official White House dog
walkers'' (so he can keep an eye on them).
</P>
<P>
   Dunst and Williams are lovable, clueless and a hoot, piercing a
monstrous scandal with adorable naivete while chastising the
president for his ``potty mouth.'' Hedaya nails Nixon's shifty,
twitchy deceptiveness and paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   But his enemies don't fare much better. Washington Post
reporters Bob Woodward (Will Ferrell) and Carl Bernstein (Bruce
McCulloch) are shown as petty, vain, lucky opportunists.
</P>
<P>
   They might even have stayed unknowns if two teens hadn't
accidentally learned the truth. To think _ what if?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   `DROP DEAD GORGEOUS' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least Kirsten Dunst has one good new flick on video. ``Drop
Dead'' should be buried in the back of the bins.
</P>
<P>
   It's fertile ground for satire: the studied wholesomeness and
cloaked ambition of beauty-pageant contestants. But the writing and
performances aren't just bad _ they're grotesque.
</P>
<P>
   At least this is a suitable vehicle for Denise Richards, unlike
her scientist role in ``The World Is Not Enough.'' Here she plays
the heinous heir apparent to a small town's beauty throne, with
Dunst as her nice-girl rival from across the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Presented as a documentary (which worked far better in the
comparable ``Waiting for Guffman''), the film heaps big, sloppy
helpings of eccentricity and nutty spitefulness on its plate.
</P>
<P>
   The cast's worst offenders are Kirstie Alley and Ellen Barkin as
the maniacal moms behind the prima donnas. To call them cartoonish
is to insult cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Such sledgehammer subtlety isn't needed to debunk low-rent
beauty pageants. A real documentary would have worked well enough.`

   `THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This glossy Hollywood product poses as a sobering look at
violent sexism in the military (a female officer is savagely raped
and later murdered) and its tendency to close ranks in the name of
solidarity but at the expense of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the film's dominant mission is to provide a star vehicle for
John Travolta, who plays a tough military investigator on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta is good, and he has some terrific scenes opposite James
Woods as an Army psychologist. Madeleine Stowe as his partner and
James Cromwell as the title's general also lend strong support.
</P>
<P>
   But rules of billing make the murderer's identity too easy to
guess, and flashbacks of the rape are hideous and overstated for a
film professing sensitivity.

   `TEACHING MRS. TINGLE' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're only as good as your last film, Kevin Williamson _ the
It screenwriter after ``Scream'' _ is very bad indeed.
</P>
<P>
   This, his directorial debut, which he also wrote, is amoral and
witless, lacking a single character we can sympathize with or at
least understand.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Holmes is an honors student who needs an ``A'' to win a
scholarship. Unfairly thwarting her is Helen Mirren's Mrs. Tingle,
a baldly antagonistic teacher who, for reasons never fully
explained, wants her students to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes and vapid classmates Barry Watson and Marissa Coughlan
invade Tingle's home to press their case and wind up as her
captors.
</P>
<P>
   Things get mindlessly messy, yet Holmes flits back to school to
accompaniment of soulful music that's supposed to make her somewhat
endearing.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   These teens are deluded idiots, and their crime plays like a
high school spin on ``A Simple Plan'' _ you know, ``Dumb and
Dumber'' without the laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Mirren, at least, has moments. She's superbly haughty and
hateful as the teacher. But she belongs in a better movie _ with a
script that provides some motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Williamson shows hints of his previous sharp dialogue,
his teen characters are still stupid, even if they do use terms
such as ``passive-aggressive'' in conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can't be the only way to get into college,'' Holmes
laments. Duh.
</P>
<P>

COLLECTOR'S EDITION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' gains a collector's edition on DVD this
week, which means you can pay $10 more to see a few trailers and
unused footage and hear its creators gush in self-praise.
</P>
<P>
   Adding ``documentaries'' to DVDs sounds good, but too often they
heap on the hype while ploddingly recounting a plot we know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare's'' disc is guilty of both. Its filmmakers extol
each other's ``brilliance.'' Didn't they get enough Oscars and
raves without wallowing in back-slapping?
</P>
<P>
   But the deleted scenes are intriguing, including an expanded
ending.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes have their tearful
parting in a different part of the theater, and her imagined
shipwreck scene is expanded.
</P>
<P>
   But best of all is a deliberate blooper from Geoffrey Rush, as a
drunken producer, exhorting his playwright in a tavern scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us have pirates, clowns and a happy ending,'' he insists,
``and you will make Harvey Weinstein a happy man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cut!'' shouts director John Madden, hurriedly entering the
frame.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein, of course, is co-founder of Miramax and this film's
executive producer.

WHAT THE `DEVIL' IS JEWEL UP TO? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yeah, but can she act?
</P>
<P>
   As a pop singer, Jewel is a success. Her combination of vocal
and writing talent, healthy good looks and sexy, independent
attitude have sold more than 15 million copies total of her two
albums, ``Pieces of You and Spirit.'' (She also has a new album of
Christmas standards, ``Joy: A Holiday Celebration'').
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Alaskan has been performing all her life, with
years of experience to hone her stage and vocal skills before
anyone really knew who she was, or cared.
</P>
<P>
   At acting, however, Jewel is a novice. ``Ride With the Devil,''
opening Friday nationwide, is her feature-film debut. Jewel has the
female lead in this Civil War drama directed by Ang Lee (``Sense
and Sensibility,'' ``The Ice Storm'').
</P>
<P>
   This time, everyone knows who Jewel is and will be analyzing
just how well she does at her new job.
</P>
<P>
   Her co-star, Tobey Maguire, had only praise for her performance
and for her courage in tackling a new field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough situation,'' Maguire said. ``She was the only
girl (among the main characters), the only one who hadn't done
anything _ and the big celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was really eager. I thought it was courageous that she
chose the thing in the first place, especially with her high
profile. People would be watching her and having expectations of
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make it easy on her. She was there to work, and she
was serious, so she earned her stripes.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting, which Jewel says she was always planning to pursue as
soon as she established her singing career, is not her first
attempt to expand her creative horizons. In 1998 she published a
book of poetry, ``A Night Without Armor,'' which took a critical
beating but made the best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   The young woman sitting scrunched down in her chair with a worn
jean jacket over her lap has a strong presence and a healthy,
outdoorish aura. Her nails are plain, her long tresses uncombed,
and she wears a T-shirt. Her only jewelry is a ring with small
diamonds and rubies.
</P>
<P>
   Jewel Kilcher has a reputation for being difficult in
interviews. That is not the case on this fall day in a Toronto
hotel. She's reserved but polite and pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Though she is mostly serious during the conversation, when she
laughs, her chuckles are hearty, not dainty. She peppers her
conversation with occasional profanity that's used unconsciously
and without emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   Jewel appears at ease, confident. But she admits some of that
confidence deserted her when it came to acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' she says, her voice suddenly soft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only because I was famous. Fame, you know, is an odd creature.
It's like its own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own person has always been most concerned with growing.
Above anything else. With no fear of failure. You're gonna fail,
you're gonna look bad sometimes if you're pushing beyond what
you're comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have that kind of courage pre-fame is real easy, because if
you fall, who cares? When you're famous, it's in front of the whole
world, and the world does not value growth over perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   When a singer, athlete or model takes a shot at acting, many
people delight in shredding the performance. More often than not,
the criticism is justified. But there also seems to be a prejudice
against famous people trying to move into new fields.
</P>
<P>
   Already an old pro at how the fame game is played, Jewel is
ready for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be just and unjust,'' she says. ``To say I am
good at music _ much less acting at age 25 _ would be absurd. I
don't think you're really great at a craft until you're probably
50, and I plan to take a lot of hits in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ride With the Devil,'' Jewel plays Sue Lee Shelley, a young
Southerner already widowed by the war when she meets and helps hide
three guerrilla fighters played by Maguire, Skeet Ulrich and
Jeffrey Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Caught up in the urgency of the war, Sue Lee puts aside
convention and falls quickly into a passionate romance with one of
the soldiers. Pregnancy and the fortunes of war tie her first to
one man, then another.
</P>
<P>
   It's a challenging and fairly large role, not the ideal first
job for an untrained actor. Jewel's performance is less than
powerful, but under the guidance of Lee, who is considered an
actor's director, she holds her own.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell is the first to admit she is not going to blow anyone off
the screen. She expects a long process of learning her new craft.
</P>
<P>
   She says she was nervous when she saw her ``Ride With the
Devil'' performance for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make myself throw up,'' she says. ``I mean, that's
good, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``But there were a lot of places where I looked at the movie and
thought, `I wish I'd done more there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If I heard tapes of some of the gigs I did when I was a kid, I
would want to kill whoever owns them,'' she says, laughing loudly.
``But luckily I got to be pretty good by the time I recorded.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this (movie) will follow me for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As a singer, Jewel is a public performer. No hiding in a
recording studio for her. She likes to get onstage, where she feels
totally in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my humor and spontaneity really come from a live
interaction, from having a new audience to impress every night and
having to be fresh every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pure energy thing _ a reciprocity. If people are tired,
they just got off work, they don't want to hear all your
intellectual, wordy music; they just want to have fun. They want to
hear a love song; they want to have comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not paying attention to their mood, (if) you go
right into heady stuff, you lose a whole crowd. That's a terrible
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a person who likes television because I know I'm going out
(on the air) live, and millions are seeing me. It raises the
stakes, and I turn on.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a film, with no audience _ except actors and
technicians who all knew a lot more about it than she did _ was
intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a real hard psychological thing for me. I had to
psych myself out for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Lee is a director who inspires confidence in
actors. He worked with Jewel for months, she says, before giving
her the part. Then he continued to give her special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ang helped me in so many areas _ like you can't move your
hands a lot on screen. I had to learn to be still, not to move my
eyes a lot, keep my chin down ... things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee taught her tai chi to ``get me grounded.'' He taught her to
pace herself so she wouldn't tire out before noon. He made her take
her lunch away from the other actors so she could focus, since it
took her longer to get back into character than the trained actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could talk to somebody right up to going onstage (to sing)
and be perfect onstage,'' she says. ``I couldn't do it with this.
It took all of my focus, all of my time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lee didn't teach her everything. Jewel came up with one
acting technique herself _ singing her lines while she learned
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not a trained actress, I didn't have any skills at
getting into character, so I had to work with what I have,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're trying to get to an emotional place in yourself, and
you want the quickest road to it. My most established path is
music. When I sing, I immediately feel the emotion I'm singing
about. It immediately overwhelms me.''
</P>
<P>
   She even wrote a couple of songs _ for herself, not for the film
_ from Sue Lee's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just put me in that mood immediately,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever critics and the public think of Jewel's work in the
film, they can expect her to do more acting. And more writing. And
anything else she finds to expand her creative side. And if she
fails, she plans to keep doing it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to (fail) at some point. I'm not kidding myself
about that. If you go beyond what you're comfortable with, you're
going to fall on your face at some point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather take the risk than not take the risk.''
</P>

CHRISTMAS: WHAT IF MARY HAD SAID NO TO THE ANGEL?

 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``Hail Mary, full of grace: The Lord is with thee. Blessed art
thou among women.''
 &HT;    These words, second nature to Catholics, always seem foreign to
me. Growing up Methodist, I rarely heard anything of the Virgin
Mary.
 &HT;    Except, of course, at Christmas.
 &HT;    As a child, I eagerly awaited unpacking the creche. Year after
year, I reverently woke Mary from her attic slumber, unwrapping her
from yellowed newspaper. Oddly comforting, she never changed. Her
blue robes flowed around her, arms crossed gently on her breast,
and eyes cast downward watching her baby son in wonder. She
embodied motherly love.
 &HT;    However, as I grew up, my childhood affection for Mary waned.
Her example of submissive motherhood offered little inspiration to
a baby boomer career woman. As feminist theologian Mary Daly put
it, ``The myth of the Incarnation logically implied the usurpation
of female power.''
 &HT;    In recent years, however, Mary's story has impressed me anew.
 &HT;    Almost 2,000 years ago, an angel visited a young girl anxiously
awaiting her own marriage. ``Fear not, Mary,'' the angel said,
``for you have found favor with God. You will conceive in your womb
and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus.''
 &HT;    Astounded, Mary asked, ``How can this be, since I am a virgin?''
 &HT;    The angel replied, ``God's spirit will come upon you and the
power of the Most High will overshadow you.''
 &HT;    Then the heavens waited.
 &HT;    Would she agree?
 &HT;    Although we don't often consider the possibility, Mary could
have said no. If I had been her, I would have. God's favor?
Pregnant out of wedlock? What of Joseph? What about the wedding?
What would my parents say? No, thank you.
 &HT;    God asked her to give up love, honor, happiness and reputation.
To accomplish God's will, she would become a social outcast.
 &HT;    The heavens waited. History hung on the word of a teenage girl.
 &HT;    ``Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me
according to your word.''
 &HT;    Yes! Yes! Yes! The word reverberated throughout the universe.
Angels rejoiced. Because of one girl's yes, God's son would be
born.
 &HT;    Mary responded not in fear, but in love. ``My soul magnifies the
Lord, my spirit rejoices in God my Savior!'' Not a submissive
woman, she risked everything with an extraordinary yes.
 &HT;    Mary's yes _ giving birth to Jesus _ transformed the world. What
if she had said no?
 &HT;    No is a powerful word. Filled with deadening power, no kills
love, creativity, and possibilities. Mary's no would have denied
the world Jesus.
 &HT;    Yes opens doors. Yes breathes life into impossible dreams. Yes
hopes when hope is not seen. Yes embodies courage.
 &HT;    Visionaries hear and speak yes when common sense says no. Martin
Luther King's yes to racial equality. Desmond Tutu's yes to a
democratic South Africa. Yitzhak Rabin's yes to Mideast peace.
 &HT;    The great theologian Karl Barth believed that ``no'' is sin.
Human beings say no to God and no to one another. In spite of our
no, Barth insisted that God said yes to us. Entering into human
history, God overcame every no with the resounding yes of a baby
born into the world.
 &HT;    When the baby grew to a man, he said yes, too. Saying yes to
God, Jesus submitted to humiliation, pain and death _ all for the
love of his brothers and sisters.
 &HT;    If not for Mary's yes, God's yes would have been silenced. No
wonder generations have blessed her.
 &HT;    This holiday season, I suggest we change ``just say no'' to
``just say yes.'' When we say yes to God, yes to love, and yes to
each other, healing and reconciliation come.
 &HT;    The Christmas story proclaims God's yes: Love and peace are born
into the world. Truly, good news of great joy for all people!

FOUR BOOKS SHOW THE READER AROUND THE 21ST CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adding to the Best of '99 theme from last week, here are some
more recommendations for holiday shoppers staring blindly at the
shelves of their local bookstores. These books would also make
great New Year gifts since they give fascinating accounts of where
we're heading in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   _ New York Times foreign affairs columnist Thomas L. Friedman
artfully writes his observations on everything from Japanese
factories to the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem in ``The Lexus and the
Olive Tree'' (Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 394 pages, $27.50).
</P>
<P>
   ``The slow, stable, chopped-up Cold War system that had
dominated international affairs since 1945 has been firmly replaced
by a new, very greased, interconnected system called
globalization,'' Friedman observes. ``We are all one river.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects of that global river are felt in every corner of the
world, as technology enhances or clashes with nations, religions,
communities and families.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman says that in the Cold War, the question most asked was
``How big is your missile?'' In today's global world, the question
is ``How fast if your modem?''
</P>
<P>
   The book was on the bestseller list for weeks, and rightly so.
It presents a fascinating picture of how once far-reaching parts of
the world are being woven together, as well as insightful
commentary on what it all means.
</P>
<P>
   _ No one is making the transition into the third industrial
revolution _ the knowledge-based economy _ better than the United
States, argues esteemed MIT economist Lester Thurow in his latest
book, ``Building Wealth: The New Rules for Individuals, Companies
and Nations in a Knowledge-Based Economy'' (HarperCollins, 301
pages, $27.50).
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 10 largest companies in the world are American,
compared with just two in 1990. Nine of the top 15 banks are also
based in the United States. In 1990, none of them were American.
</P>
<P>
   But now the big shift is from national to global for business _
and no world government organization with any real power exists,
Thurow warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means a global economy with no enforceable, agreed-upon
set of rules and regulations, no sheriff to enforce codes of
acceptable behavior, and no judges and juries to appeal to if one
feels that justice is not being done,'' Thurow writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continental Europeans often refer to what is now happening as
`cowboy capitalism.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thurow also suggests that one of the biggest changes in the
economy in the next century will be in retailing.
</P>
<P>
   _ How Alan Greenspan made the Fed chairmanship such a pinnacle
of power and how he influences the world markets is explored in
``The Greenspan Effect: Words That Move the World's Markets''
(McGraw Hill, 273 pages, $18.95).
</P>
<P>
   The book is written by best-selling business authors and
consultants David B. Sicilia and Jeffrey L. Cruikshank, who have
done their homework. Sicilia and Cruikshank take a different
approach by staying away from technical jargon and charts and
discuss the issues often in Greenspan's own words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our subject has become a megacelebrity _ known, respected,
feared, scrutinized, consulted, and quoted throughout the world,''
they write. ``Alan Greenspan has emerged as one of the most
influential actors on the world economic stage.''
</P>
<P>
   How has he done this and helped the U.S. economy enjoy its
longest period of uninterrupted growth in history? Sicilia and
Cruikshank explain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Global aging is going to be a serious issue in the next
century, and economist and author Peter G. Peterson explores its
monumental impact in ``Gray Dawn: How the Coming Age Wave Will
Transform America _ and the World'' (Times Books, 280 pages, $23).
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that global aging will become the transcendent
political and economic issue of the twenty-first century,''
Peterson writes.
</P>
<P>
   Among his observations: By 2030, 25 percent of the total world
population will be seniors. By 2030, the benefits of Social
Security, Medicare, Medicaid and federal and military pensions will
exceed total revenues in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson offers a number of ideas to address these problems,
including raising the retirement age, encouraging larger families
with government benefits tied to the number of children and
applying benefits only to seniors who need financial help, not to
those with other incomes and savings.

   ``Understanding and Changing Your Management Style''
</P>
<P>
   By Robert C. Benfari
</P>
<P>
   Jossey-Bass, $25
</P>
<P>
   This book was developed from the curriculum that Robert Benfari
assembled for his course at Harvard University School of Public
Health called ``Understanding Your Management Style.'' While
teaching this course and hundreds of workshops and seminars
throughout the country, Benfari developed what he calls an
Integrated Management Style Model, which is designed to help
managers analyze how they react to many aspects of management.

Market Boom''
</P>
<P>
   By Stephen and Donna Leeb

<P>
   McGraw Hill, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   Has the technological world slowed down? That is one of the
burning issues in market analysts Stephen and Donna Leeb's latest
book. They say that technological advances are slowing and that,
combined with a mandate for economic growth, will lead to that
awful ``I'' word _ inflation. The Leebs, who write one of the
largest investment newsletters in the country, Personal Finance,
provide a strategy on dealing with this major influence over the
markets.

</P>
<P>
   The 19 business people chosen for this book have spent most of
their lives in the trenches. From Sam Walton and Henry Ford ll to
Herb Kelleher and David Packard, these business icons have done
more than pontificate on how business should be run; they've run
it. Each is featured in anecdotes and with quotes and interesting
stories of who they are and how they got where they did. Julie
Fenster is a business historian who writes for The New York Times
and other publications.

CHRISTMAS: WHAT IF MARY HAD SAID NO TO THE ANGEL?

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``Hail Mary, full of grace: The Lord is with thee. Blessed art
thou among women.''
 &HT;    These words, second nature to Catholics, always seem foreign to
me. Growing up Methodist, I rarely heard anything of the Virgin
Mary.
 &HT;    Except, of course, at Christmas.
 &HT;    As a child, I eagerly awaited unpacking the creche. Year after
year, I reverently woke Mary from her attic slumber, unwrapping her
from yellowed newspaper. Oddly comforting, she never changed. Her
blue robes flowed around her, arms crossed gently on her breast,
and eyes cast downward watching her baby son in wonder. She
embodied motherly love.
 &HT;    However, as I grew up, my childhood affection for Mary waned.
Her example of submissive motherhood offered little inspiration to
a baby boomer career woman. As feminist theologian Mary Daly put
it, ``The myth of the Incarnation logically implied the usurpation
of female power.''
 &HT;    In recent years, however, Mary's story has impressed me anew.
 &HT;    Two thousand years ago, an angel visited a young girl anxiously
awaiting her own marriage. ``Fear not, Mary,'' the angel said,
``for you have found favor with God. You will conceive in your womb
and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus.''
 &HT;    Astounded, Mary asked, ``How can this be, since I am a virgin?''
 &HT;    The angel replied, ``God's spirit will come upon you and the
power of the Most High will overshadow you.''
 &HT;    Then the heavens waited.
 &HT;    Would she agree?
 &HT;    Although we don't often consider the possibility, Mary could
have said no. If I had been her, I would have. God's favor?
Pregnant out of wedlock? What of Joseph? What about the wedding?
What would my parents say? No, thank you.
 &HT;    God asked her to give up love, honor, happiness and reputation.
To accomplish God's will, she would become a social outcast.
 &HT;    The heavens waited. History hung on the word of a teenage girl.
 &HT;    ``Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me
according to your word.''
 &HT;    Yes! Yes! Yes! The word reverberated throughout the universe.
Angels rejoiced. Because of one girl's yes, God's son would be
born.
 &HT;    Mary responded not in fear, but in love. ``My soul magnifies the
Lord, my spirit rejoices in God my Savior!'' Not a submissive
woman, she risked everything with an extraordinary yes.
 &HT;    Mary's yes _ giving birth to Jesus _ transformed the world. What
if she had said no?
 &HT;    No is a powerful word. Filled with deadening power, no kills
love, creativity, and possibilities. Mary's no would have denied
the world Jesus.
 &HT;    Yes opens doors. Yes breathes life ino impossible dreams. Yes
hopes when hope is not seen. Yes embodies courage.
 &HT;    Visionaries hear and speak yes when common sense says no. Martin
Luther King's yes to racial equality. Desmond Tutu's yes to a
democratic South Africa. Yitzhak Rabin's yes to Mideast peace.
 &HT;    The great theologian Karl Barth believed that ``no'' is sin.
Human beings say no to God and no to one another. In spite of our
no, Barth insisted that God said yes to us. Entering into human
history, God overcame every no with the resounding yes of a baby
born into the world.
 &HT;    When the baby grew to a man, he said yes, too. Saying yes to
God, Jesus submitted to humiliation, pain and death _ all for the
love of his brothers and sisters.
 &HT;    If not for Mary's yes, God's yes would have been silenced. No
wonder generations have blessed her.
 &HT;    This holiday season, I suggest we change ``just say no'' to
``just say yes.'' When we say yes to God, yes to love, and yes to
each other, healing and reconciliation come.
 &HT;    The Christmas story proclaims God's yes: Love and peace are born
into the world. Truly, good news of great joy for all people!

BACK TO `THE WAY WE WERE'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Rob Lowman's weekly column on new videos and DVDs) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   Memories, in the corner of her mind. And one of Barbra
Streisand's fondest memories was making ``The Way We Were,''
calling it a highlight of her career.
</P>
<P>
   And listening to her speak about ``The Way We Were'' on a
65-minute documentary that accompanies the 25th anniversary edition
DVD of the film (Columbia; $24.99), you know she means it.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's great affection for the film is evident when she
talks about her role role as Katie Morosky, the leftist Jewish girl
who falls for WASPish Hubbell Gardiner (Robert Redford), saying she
identified with her character's being an outsider. Interestingly,
Streisand still feels that two scenes director Sydney Pollack cut
after a preview should have remained in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack, who is also interviewed in the documentary, says he and
the actress have been having a discussion about it ever since.
Streisand contends that the way the film ended up makes it seem
like Katie and Hubbell split up over an affair he had, but the two
scenes show that the real reason they parted had to do with their
longstanding political and philosophical differences.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand even allowed the deleted scenes to be used in the
documentary, so the viewer can make the choice. Pollack tactfully
says that thought he made the right decision then _ based on the
fact that the film flowed better _ but is less sure now.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Hamlisch and Alan and Marilyn Bergman, who wrote the
Oscar-winning title song, discuss the music on the documentary,
including Streisand's suggesting the change of the opening word of
the song from ``daydreams'' to ``memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Authur Laurents, who is also interviewed, mentions
that after talking to Streisand, he remembered a girl from his
youth named Fanny Brice (strangely the same name as that of the
famed comedienne Streisand portrayed in ``Funny Girl''), who became
the model for Katie.
</P>
<P>
   As for Redford, he's just talked about. Pollack notes the actor
was reluctant at first to do the role because it was a ``pinup girl
in reverse,'' and Streisand thinks it's his best performance. And
in a testament to the enduring affection fans have for the romantic
tearjerker, Laurents says Redford told him that women still come up
to him and brush the hair off his forehead the way Katie did to
Hubbell at the end of the film. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether this year's Oscar-winning film will spark the same kind
of affection and memories in 25 years remains to be seen, but in
the meantime the collector's series version of ``Shakespeare in
Love'' on DVD (Miramax; $39.99) tells you everything you need to
know about the romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   As Joseph Fiennes, who plays the Bard, points out on a 22-minute
behind-the-scenes feature called `Shakespeare in Love and on
Film,'' the film provided ``a great chance to reinvent someone who
we think we know.'' Others in the cast, plus academics, offer their
views on the playwright and Elizabethan times.
</P>
<P>
   Also included on the DVD is running commentary from director
John Madden (great for those interested in the filmmaking process)
and four deleted scenes, including an alternate ending and a joke
the crew made for Miramax head Harvey Weinstein (unlike most DVDs
with extra material, though, the four scenes aren't separate but
are strung together.)
</P>
<P>
   While ``Shakespeare'' and ``The Way We Were'' take on romance
from two different angles (and eras), they'd make a great double
bill _ maybe New Year's Eve would be a good time. You choose the
order. &QL;

<P>
   Absolute power corrupts pretty thoroughly in ``The Emperor and
the Assassin,'' Chen Kaige's ravishing, complicated and morally
obvious epic about the bloody unification of China in the third
century BC.
</P>
<P>
   From swords to voluminous silk gowns to massive palace
pageantry, the movie doesn't make an aesthetic misstep. And while
its battle scenes will inevitably be compared to Kurosawa's, Chen's
staging actually evokes a more abstract, specifically Chinese
design. The action is gorgeous and sweeping, but of a harmonious
piece with the film's smaller, quieter sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Both of which are about equally confusing. It's probably safe to
say that the nearly three-hour movie faithfully depicts the
intricacies of forging China's seven warring kingdoms into the
short-lived Qin Dynasty. But the scenario presents such a
bewildering skein of ploys, deceptions, shifting allegiances and
unwelcome revelations, close attention must be paid _ at times
through soporific expositional stretches _ in order to keep on top
of the plot.
</P>
<P>
   The story's implications are much easier to follow. In fact,
they're classic: Great man betrays both his ideals and the love of
his life in order to achieve his primary goal; a woman's passion
and ethics collide tragically; a warrior's psychic armor is
breached by the actions of an innocent, et cetera.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, who made the magisterial ``Farewell My Concubine,'' once
again calls on that film's charismatic leads, Gong Li and Zhang
Fenyi, then pits them against the equally formidable talent of Li
Xuejian. Li is Ying Zhen, King of Qin, whose dream of a peaceful,
united China _ under Qin rule, of course _ is at odds with the
actions he takes to realize it.
</P>
<P>
   Gong's Lady Zhao has been Ying Zhen's lover since their youth
and plots with him to justify the invasion of a neighboring
kingdom. While she goes there in faux exile, really to search for
an assassin to send back to the Qin court and provoke an incident,
Ying Zhen learns a devastating secret about his ancestry that
propels him into a bloody reign of terror.
</P>
<P>
   Shocked by her lover's brutality _ and there are few more
striking moments in this year's cinema than the sight of Gong, the
most exquisite beauty in all of world cinema, madly digging
children's corpses out of a shallow mass grave _ Lady Zhao becomes
enamored of Jing Ke (Zhang), the assassin she'd been tricking into
carrying out her plot. Now she really wants Jing Ke to kill Ying
Zheng, but the former hit man has his own traumatic past to
overcome first.
</P>
<P>
   Predictable as some of this is, ``The Emperor and the Assassin''
possesses undeniable mythic resonance, which Chen and his superb
cinematographer Zhao Fei (whose fine work is also on display in
Woody Allen's couldn't-be-more-different ``Sweet and Lowdown'')
never fail to reinforce with imposing, brilliantly composed
imagery. Chen's movie is a long, sometimes slow haul, but it's
ultimately, breathtakingly worth the commitment. &QL;

CLEVER `BICENTENNIAL MAN' MISSES THE BIG PICTURE

<P>
   Imagine Sam Neill as a rather open-minded 19th-century
Southerner, one who treats a slave as nicely as anyone who ever
kept another human being as property.
</P>
<P>
   Picture Robin Williams as his butler, a subservient,
gentle-natured fellow who, as he often says, ``is glad tobe of
service.'' Inside, he never stops yearning to be free, if only in
the legal sense, while keeping his post with ``Sir'' and his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward that scenario 150 years and then some, and you have
``Bicentennial Man,'' director Chris Columbus' adaptation of a
short story by sci-fi author Isaac Asimov. It is a story worth
telling, especially to young audiences who seek out Williams'
movies, if only it didn't feel as though it took 200 years to tell
it.
</P>
<P>
   Williams plays a robot dubbed Andrew by the San Francisco family
who acquires him fresh from the factory sometime ``in the near
future.'' It is apparent early on that Andrew is no ordinary
NorthAm Robotics model NDR-114. He seems to feel some emotions, at
least on a primitive level.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than trying to suppress Andrew's ambitions to understand
the human condition, Sir decides his family will treat Andrew as a
person _ albeit one who probably has been purchased on a payment
plan _ and he encourages the machine's curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Andrew evolves in both emotional and
intellectual development, and undergoes physical advancements that
enable him to smile, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no denying he's still a robot, an ageless piece of
machinery that outlives Sir, Ma'am and their daughter, Little Miss,
and still doesn't know how to mourn their loss.
</P>
<P>
   While wealthy Americans spend time and money trying to postpone
the inevitable, Andrew never ceases his quest to be mortal, to feel
the extreme highs and lows and aches and pains humans go through on
their way to death. It takes him 200 years to realize that goal.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Williams lets his personality shine through the
most inhuman of his costumes; somehow he transcends the glassy
eyes, the hinged mouth and the stiff joints to give Andrew the
unique quality apparent to his master. But often there is too much
of Williams in the role _ either the actor himself or one of his
past characters. It's almost as if Andrew were channeling Mrs.
Doubtfire and Mork at a seance.
</P>
<P>
   Embeth Davidtz holds her own in a dual role as the adult Little
Miss and, later, her granddaughter Portia. She has risen to the
challenge of aging as two different women, both of them dear to
Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   Just when Williams' role turns serious, Oliver Platt and
Kiersten Warren lighten up the movie as a late 21st century
inventor and his overly perky robot assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Johnson's robotic effects (and yes, Andrew is most often
Williams in a suit) are quite good. Norman Reynolds' fanciful
impressions of futuristic San Francisco are appealing in a
``Tomorrowland'' sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   It's not often that Columbus (``Home Alone'' and ``Jingle All
the Way'') is associated with food-for-thought movies.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bicentennial Man'' he has an important fable about the
values of freedom and human life. Unfortunately, with the pace set
by Columbus and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan, their most important
audience may lose interest before they get the message. &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The film: ``Bicentennial Man'' (PG; some profanity and adult
themes). &QL; 
The stars: Robin Williams, Sam Neill, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, Embeth
Davidtz, Oliver Platt. &QL;

Kazan. Released by Touchstone Pictures. &QL;

   ``Pale and paler'' might be one way to describe the color scheme
for ``Onegin,'' Martha Fiennes' visually haunting but dramatically
anemic treatment of Alexander Pushkin's early 19th-century verse
novel ``Evgeny Onegin.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a movie that sees its feverishly romantic subject in
chilly, washed-out tones: The blinding, icy wastes of the Russian
steppes; the eerie, pallid interiors of old St. Petersburg houses;
the milky, almost translucent faces of the movie's stars, Ralph
Fiennes and Liv Tyler, whose features appear to such dazzling
effect here that they might've been sculpted in alabaster.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, director Fiennes has swathed Pushkin's lyricized tale of
a naive girl's unrequited love and a cynical man's tragically
belated conversion in an atmosphere so emotionally muted that at
times the movie actually falls completely silent. It's as if the
filmmakers feared that the story's few instances of raw emotional
outburst might shatter the mood of somber introspection they've
worked so hard to create. In the end, it's the absence of emotional
frisson between its two leads that makes ``Onegin'' come apart.
</P>
<P>
   An enduringly popular piece of literature that Tchaikovsky
converted into an opera, ``Evgeny Onegin'' is often described as
Byronic. But its hero, a jaded, erotically repressed young man
whose citified life changes irrevocably when he inherits his
uncle's country estate, distinctly lacks the Byronic antihero
swagger.
</P>
<P>
   As played by Ralph Fiennes, the torturously debonair British
leading man who also happens to be the director's brother, Onegin
initially seems like any other semi-aristocratic fop leading a life
of idle debauchery in Russia's most Europeanized city.
</P>
<P>
   Only after he relocates to the provinces does Onegin reveal a
subtle cast of mind, along with some vaguely leftist political
leanings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serfdom is a feudal practice _ no civilized society should
condone it,'' he declares at a dinner party, much to the dismay of
the local gentry.
</P>
<P>
   The only person who doesn't recoil is Onegin's new next-door
neighbor's beautiful youngest daughter, Tatyana Larin (Liv Tyler),
a spirited, bookish young woman who quickly develops an infatuation
with the enigmatic young bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   Onegin also strikes up a joshing friendship with Lensky (Toby
Stephens), a robust poet-outdoorsman who's engaged to Tatyana's
more sedate older sister, Olga (Lena Headey). While these and the
other secondary characters are generally well-performed, they don't
leave deep impressions.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Evgeny Onegin'' is by now a hoary classic, it gives
away nothing to reveal that Onegin, hardening his already frosty
heart, rejects Tatyana's passionate advances. Soon after, he kills
Lensky in a duel precipitated by Onegin's contemptuous treatment of
Olga, then flees into exile.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to St. Petersburg six years later, he rediscovers
a very grown-up Tatyana, only to realize too late that he has
squandered his best chance at happiness in life.
</P>
<P>
   Although director Fiennes and cinematographer Remi Adefarasin
succeed in finding some striking poetic imagery to match Pushkin's
verse, the movie also resorts to such gimmicky strategies as
shooting the actors in slow-motion and/or minus the soundtrack _
awkward, repetitious gestures that don't enhance meaning.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, the film is undercut by Tyler's severely limited
range. Plausible enough as a passionate virgin in ``Stealing
Beauty,'' her screen breakthrough, this young actress lacks the
technical maturity to pull off Tatyana's transition from country
bumpkin to the sophisticated woman of means who later brings Onegin
literally to his knees. The character's nuances elude Tyler, and
the movie flatlines.
</P>
<P>
   Required to play opposite what is essentially a beautiful
mannequin, Fiennes' performance _ dryly witty and carefully
measured at first _ grows attenuated and overly mannered. By film's
end, he's reduced to thin smiles and eyes full of painful longing _
understandable reactions to a sadly squandered opportunity. &QL;

<P>
   ``Magnolia'' is an exuberant outburst of creative genius and
lavish emotionalism. Only the third feature from writer-director
Paul Thomas Anderson, it succeeds at a level of possibility most
filmmakers can't even conceive of, let alone grasp. The film is so
audacious and uncompromising that it's likely to make as many
enemies as it does partisans, but don't be mistaken: ``Magnolia''
is the only true end-of-the-millennium masterpiece, an achievement
that will be hard to match for many years to come _ and whose
influence should rightly be felt well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is an ensemble piece marked by compassionately
devastating insights into human weakness, a narrative structure as
complex as it is inventive and a mildly abstract quality that,
combined with other elements, makes it all play like a great piece
of music. It's set during a 24-hour period in the San Fernando
Valley (Anderson's hometown and the setting for his excellent
``Boogie Nights''), and it quite persuasively captures the area's
elusive ambience while illuminating feelings that anyone, anywhere
could recognize _ but (and this is where so much of the genius
lies) in terms so utterly, imaginatively specific, they seem
shockingly new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia'' charts the spiritual misadventures of nine main
characters and an equal number of key supporting ones, all of whom
face down personal crises of generally shattering import. The
individual stories interweave, counterpoint and sometimes influence
one another, but the overall impression is one of general isolation
breached by small, vital acts of connecting grace. The
orchestration of desperate lives follows a superficially
nonsensical, three-part prologue and climaxes under a wildly
peculiar act of God.
</P>
<P>
   Game-show producer Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) lays dying in
his comfortable home. A pack of yappy dogs attends him, along with
Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a young home health-care nurse who
evidently cares more about the old man than his much younger wife,
Linda (Julianne Moore), does. But looks are deceptive; Linda may
spend most of the drizzly day driving her Mercedes from lawyer to
shrink to pharmacy and back, popping pills and cursing up a storm
at anyone she meets, but is she really being driven by vulgar
materialism, or by unbearable tenderness?
</P>
<P>
   Along a parallel track (and it is astonishing how deftly
Anderson has created characters who not only mirror, but reflect
upon, one another), the beloved host of Earl's show, Jimmy Gator
(Philip Baker Hall) longs to patch things up with his estranged
adult daughter now that he's been diagnosed with cancer. But
Claudia Gator (Melora Walters) is too angry and coked-out to accept
her father's overtures. When a lonely-hearted North Hollywood cop,
Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly), comes by to tell her to turn the
stereo down, he falls in love.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the main cast are Jeremy Blackman's Stanley
Spector, a child genius about to hit it big on the game show, and
William H. Macy's Donnie Smith, once its biggest star and now an
abject adult failure. And calling more attention to himself than
anybody is Tom Cruise, in by far the most outlandish and finest
performance of his profitable career, as the despicable but
understandable Frank Mackey, a self-help lecturer whose whole act
is making guys feel good by denigrating women. Cruise is so
wickedly sharp, infuriatingly piggish and reluctantly vulnerable in
the role that he would easily steal the movie from his equally
weighted co-stars if Anderson were any less a master of egalitarian
emotional tone.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, everyone's issues bear equivalent poignancy, and
we can't help but appreciate every actor's finely tuned
performance.
</P>
<P>
   But as impressive as they are, Anderson's people skills are only
half the story. With expert help from director of photography
Robert Elswit and editor Dylan Tichenor (both ``Boogie''
collaborators), he composes ``Magnolia's'' human and formal
elements into a unique kind of cinematic symphony. There's a
40-minute section in the long movie's midsection during which Jon
Brion's driving score never ceases, while all the participants'
traumas build to crescendo pitch. The segment is a sheer
masterpiece of montage and tempo, but it's only one example of how
``Magnolia'' powerfully dissolves the barrier between movie and
music.
</P>
<P>
   Aimee Mann's telling songs sometimes overwhelm the dialogue
tracks, but only when they have more to say about what's really
going on than the characters' self-deluding words. At one point,
actors in different scenes actually sing along to Mann's aching
anthem ``Wise Up''; it's a bold and breathtakingly touching
break-the-movie-illusion gambit. So is Earl's riskily unaccompanied
recitation of his life's regrets, during which Robards' voice
croakingly rises into the ether as if to warn other characters in
the throes of their own mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the unrelenting richness of Anderson's artistry and
honesty has already earned ``Magnolia'' the overindulgence charge.
All that can really be said to counter such criticism is that the
grumps say ``indulgent'' like it's a bad thing. With ``Magnolia,''
Anderson invites us to luxuriate in a profound vision of wayward,
striving humanity. Accepting his invitation is not an easy
commitment, to be sure. But the rewards of taking Anderson up on
his own terms are among the greatest this century of cinema has
ever offered. &QL;

&HT;     THE UNJUST CASE AGAINST WEN HO LEE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GEORGE KOO  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Americans across the country regard the
indictment of Dr. Wen Ho Lee on charges of illegally downloading
nuclear secrets as a travesty of justice, one which affects the
future of all Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Just what is it that sticks in our craw about this case?
Consider the following:
</P>
<P>
   Lee has not been charged with espionage, despite a year of
government claims that he, a native of Taiwan, was a spy for China.
Instead, he has been charged with receiving and tampering with
information relating to national security. Significantly, he was
not charged with violating rules that prohibit disclosure of
information relating to national security.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the 59 counts against Lee is this: He downloaded
and reloaded secure data. The lead prosecutor has just about
conceded in public that he does not expect the charges that carry
life imprisonment to stick.
</P>
<P>
   The defense will argue that Lee is a victim of selective
prosecution, and will introduce evidence of at least 30 instances
in which secure data were similarly mishandled by others but no
charges were brought.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys repeatedly offered to have Lee undergo
polygraph tests to clarify and verify certain issues relating to
missing computer tapes. The prosecution refused all offers. To
date, the prosecutor also has failed to provide a list of the
allegedly missing tapes to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   In a further effort to intimidate Lee in hopes of bargaining a
guilty plea to lesser charges, the prosecution asked that he be
detained without bail for the duration of the case, even though he
hardly fits the profile of a ``flight risk.'' Lee owns property,
has family in the United States and has cooperated with the
prosecution throughout the process, including turning in his
American passport.
</P>
<P>
   A federal magistrate on Monday ordered Lee held without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Given the more than 1,000 FBI interviews, 1 million computer
files and mounds of documents the defense must now review, the case
will likely take one to two years to prepare before it can come to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the defense has studiously followed the letter of the
law and never attempted to try the case via deliberate leaks to the
news media. The prosecution, by contrast, has been trying the case
in the news media since March 7, 1999, when the New York Times,
quoting unnamed sources, reported that the government was about to
arrest a Chinese-American scientist for espionage.
</P>
<P>
   As reputable attorneys have rallied to Lee's defense, along with
prominent national Asian-American organizations like the Committee
of 100, the defense has begun to capture media attention.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the political nature of the case, Attorney General
Janet Reno, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger, FBI director Louis Freeh and others met with
top White House staff the weekend before Lee's arrest to debate the
merits of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, reportedly, was in favor of pressing on.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Clinton administration opted to appease its
political adversaries. Lee, already a victim of racial profiling,
in the words of former Los Alamos security chief Robert Vrooman, is
now the White House's newest scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   In view of these facts, the message is clear. If Asian-Americans
stay home and keep quiet about the case of Wen Ho Lee, you better
plan to apologize to your children and grandchildren later.
</P>
<P>
   To any American of conscience with a love for this country,
regardless of ethnicity, you must speak out because a major
underpinning of what makes this country great is being discarded in
favor of bigotry, racial prejudice and political expediency.

BOOKS THAT WILL GIVE YOUNG READERS HOURS OF ENJOYMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY MEDLYN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some books that young readers will enjoy:
</P>
<P>
   ``THE HAT: THE HEDGIE GIFT BOX'' &QL; 
Jan Brett &QL; 
(G.P. Putnam's Sons, $16.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brett's 1997 charmer about a cute little hedgehog is freshly
packaged into a gift box with a stuffed toy hedgehog just in time
for the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   The story centers on Hedgie, who crawls inside a sock that blows
off a clothesline. As the other animals poke fun at him, Hedgie
proudly proclaims that he's wearing a hat to keep warm in the snow.
Not a bad idea, they think. Soon the clothes line is stripped bare.
</P>
<P>
   Brett's colorful, realistic illustrations appeal to young
children. Her trademark border pictures add another layer of
meaning to the tale. For ages 2-5. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``FINGER PUPPET THEATER: THE THREE LITTLE PIGS'' &QL; 
Illustrated by Peter Stevenson (Scholastic, $13.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a great idea! Finger puppets, board books and fairy tales _
all wrapped up in one package. Scholastic's Finger Puppet Theater
series also includes Hansel and Gretel, Goldilocks and the Little
Red Riding Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Four finger puppet characters come with each story, which
children act out using the sturdy board book pages as a stage.
Lively text and amusing pictures carry the plots.
</P>
<P>
   Young imaginations will soar! For ages 3-7. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MORRIS'S DISAPPEARING BAG'' &QL; 
Rosemary Wells (Viking, $15.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Author of more than 60 children's books, Wells and her beloved
bunny Morris always are a hit. This tale begins on Christmas
morning. Morris' brother Victor gets a hockey outfit. His sister
Rose gets a beauty kit. His sister Betty gets a chemistry set.
Hands off, they say to Morris, who gets a teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   Then Morris discovers one last gift left under the tree, which
leads to much merriment. The adorable pictures of the bunny family
are funny and captivating. For ages 3-7. &QL;

BIG BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch
of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of
Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
was the winter of despair . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTIES'' &QL; 
Richard Avedon &QL; 
(Random House/Kodak, $75) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   It's my pleasure to tell you that Richard Avedon's new book,
``The Sixties,'' begins not with a photographic image but with the
opening paragraph of ``A Tale of Two Cities, words written 140
years ago but so remarkably suited to the edgy chaos of the 1960s
that you'll wonder whether Charles Dickens shared some funny
cigarettes with Abbie Hoffman in another life.
</P>
<P>
   Avedon and his collaborator, Doon Arbus, have put together a
book that shows the decade in all its abrasive and contradictory
glory. Notice the juxtaposition of Rose Kennedy and Janis Joplin
(at opposite ends of the book, each wearing her version of finery
and an eerie frown), Truman Capote displaying his belly button and
Andy Warhol his scars, the stiff stare of Henry Kissinger and the
serene gaze of Cesar Chavez. There's the requisite nudity _ female
breasts are outnumbered, for once, by male genitalia _ and every so
often a splash of color that reminds us that psychedelic was a
household word. It will make you squirm, and it will make you laugh
_ a '60s effect indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big books you might spend your money on this
Christmas season:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``ILLUSTRATED LETTERS: ARTISTS AND WRITERS CORRESPOND'' &QL; 
Edited by Roselyne de Ayala and Jean-Pierre Gueno (Abrams, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the art of the handwritten letter taken to grand
heights. The editors have gathered more than 60 letters written by
European artists and authors of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some
are just notes with doodles in the margins. Others are illustrated
with exquisite sketches and watercolor scenes. Among the generous
correspondents: Honore de Balzac, Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant,
Arthur Rimbaud, Auguste Rodin, Edouard Manet, Vincent van Gogh,
Paul Gaugin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Max Jacob
and Antoine de Saint-Exupery. With a foreword by Francine Prose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FAY'' &QL; 
William Wegman (Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've grown tired of Wegman's ubiquitous Weimaraners, this
book might pull you back into the fold. The text that accompanies
Wegman's photos of his beloved Fay Ray and her offspring, Battina
(who stayed on after Fay's other puppies went off to new homes),
reminds us that these were DOGS, that in addition to their work
with Wegman _ Fay, especially, knew how to hold a pose _ they
chased balls, hurled themselves into swimming pools, played in the
mud, mated, gave birth and changed their owner's life in ways not
just professional. If there's a dog lover on your Christmas list,
look here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WOMEN &QL; 
Annie Leibovitz, with an essay by Susan Sontag (Random House,
$75). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of women, celebrated and obscure. It begins with a
photograph of Leibovitz's mother, then moves on to farmers, maids,
astronauts, soldiers, battered wives, Supreme Court judges,
showgirls and bull riders. More familiar faces are those of
Elizabeth Taylor, architect Maya Lin, writers Eudora Welty and
Jamaica Kincaid, Yoko Ono, Susan Sarandon, Joni Mitchell, Serena
and Venus Williams, Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. It's
worth the price of admission just to see the kind gaze of the late
Osceola McCarty, who worked for 75 years as a Mississippi
washerwoman, then donated $150,000 that she'd saved over her
lifetime to establish a college scholarship for African-American
students in need. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ART OF THE MARKET &QL; 
Bob Tamarkin and Les Krantz (ST&AMP;C, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An illustrated history of American business as seen through its
stock certificates. The paper certificates that were proof of
ownership before the days of electronic trading are becoming
financial artifacts with a value of their own. From a terrier named
Prince, who appeared on certificates issued by Farmers Deposit
National Bank in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s (Prince's owner was
the bank president), to the nude woman on certificates for Playboy
Enterprises, Tamarkin and Krantz show how whimsical a marriage of
art and commerce can be. &QL; 
``AND THE CROWD GOES WILD'' &QL; 
Joe Garner (Sourcebooks, $49.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is not the book, which is nothing extraordinary,
but two CDs that offer broadcasts of some of the most memorable
moments in sports. Included are Lou Gehrig saying goodbye to
baseball; Bill Mazeroski's home run in the 1960 World Series; the
Green Bay Packers' win over Dallas in December 1967; Bob Beamon's
long jump in the 1968 Olympics; Secretariat's triumph in the Triple
Crown; the Borg-McEnroe match at Wimbledon in 1980; Tiger Woods'
triumph at the 1997 Masters; Michael Jordan's sixth NBA
championship; and the U.S. women's win in soccer's 1999 World Cup.
With a foreword by Hank Aaron, an afterword by Wayne Gretzky, and
narration by Bob Costas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``SNAKE'' &QL; 
Chris Mattison (DK, $29.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big, bold pictures of creatures you don't want to find under
your Christmas tree. There are more than 60 individual species from
all over the world in Mattison's ``gallery,'' with information
about environment, anatomy, reproduction, and hunting and feeding.
A starter for would-be herpetologists. &QL; 
``NORMAN ROCKWELL: PICTURES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE''  &QL; 
(Abrams, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you love the paintings of Norman Rockwell, you can come out
of the closet now. Critics and art historians who previously looked
down their noses at Rockwell are now celebrating his influence on
the American psyche. This book, published in conjunction with the
traveling exhibition of the same name, includes 80 of Rockwell's
paintings, as well as essays not only by curators and historians
but by Robert Coles and Rockwell's son, Peter. The paintings are
anecdotal and as familiar as your own memories. The essays at times
seem like a collective  &UR; mea culpa offered to a man long regarded as
a mere illustrator, and to the people who have admired him for
decades. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``AFRICAN CEREMONIES'' &QL; 
Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher &UR; Abrams, $150) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This slip-cased, two-volume set weighs 16 pounds, covers 26
countries and contains descriptions and photographs of more than 40
ceremonies, some of which will make you flinch just to think about
them. Spectacularly illustrated, it's the cornerstone of the
authors' effort to document vanishing tribal customs in Africa. &QL; 
``NEW YORK: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY'' &QL; 
Ric Burns and James Sanders &UR; (Knopf, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of strolling on the thin edge of
nothingness. A splattering of fiery particles cascades down from
the torches that the steel workers use for cutting 10-ton girders
in half and for lighting their cigarettes.'' That's how the ``New
York Times'' described the spectacular bravado of the men who built
the Empire State Building in 1930, one of the best stories in this
elegant companion volume to the public television documentary
written and directed by Burns. &QL; 
``EARLY DYLAN'' &QL; 
Photographs by Barry Feinstein, Daniel Kramer and Jim Marshall
(Bulfinch, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It could break your heart, he looks so young and happy. So do
Joan Baez and Mary Travers and even Johnny Cash. They stay that way
within the confines of this slim book, unlike the aging Dylan we
see in Richard Avedon's ``The Sixties.'' This collection of
photographs is a slice of '60s life that skirts the flamboyance and
focuses on a handful of people, their friendships and their music.
With a short foreword by Arlo Guthrie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``YACHTING'S GOLDEN AGE'' &QL; 
Ed Holm (Knopf, $65) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are more than 100 glass-plate images documenting yachting's
glory days, from 1880 to 1905. You don't have to know much about
sailing to see that these boats were extraordinary, each a
one-of-a-kind, handcrafted vessel with a unique personality. When
seen from across an expanse of water, they looked, Holm writes,
like ``a flight of giant migrating butterflies,'' their sails
swollen all out of proportion to the tiny crafts below. These
images were made by a handful of pioneering maritime photographers,
who used techniques developed in the years after the Civil War.

 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are waiting for the return of ``The Gong Show'' to prime
time. That is how dispirited and jaded we are about stupid game
shows sucking up time and space on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   If everyone is so fired up about game shows, start the Game Show
Network and let us have our sitcoms back. And as much as we have
mocked Regis, we would take it all back if only someone would say
that the hiring of Maury Povich to host ``Twenty One'' were a cruel
joke.
</P>
<P>
   What next _ Jenny Jones doing ``Card Sharks'' or Ricki Lake
hosting ``The Joker's Wild''?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &LR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Let's face the hard truth, those Gap Christmas ads are great.
Very catchy, visually stimulating, addictive.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, after countless great campaigns, ESPN is
mired in two lousy ones. The dogs-playing-poker idea was never ever
funny and just continues to get old. And its latest, the ``Hoops
Malone'' sitcom concept with Dick Vitale, is just lame and
embarrassing for all involved. Get back to basics, the kind of
subtle humor that drove the promos for ``SportsCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &LR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's always an eye-opener to find out what USA Network is
planning. No other channel loves the patently cheap and sexy like
USA. It has Sam Raimi lined up for a ``psychological thriller in
the tradition of `Rosemary's Baby,''' a drama about the United
States entering the fray of a Mexican civil war; and ``Desert
High,'' described as a drama of ``two rival groups of teen-agers
ensconced in an epic turf war, where the weapons of choice are
fuel-injected muscle cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, those are the dramas.
</P>
<P>
   And where does USA get off using the word ``ensconced''? That
has to stop.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &LR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The White House is expected to step up efforts to better educate
the country about the V-chip, which is installed in every new
television. This ought to make it easy _ just press the ``let the
government raise your kid'' button on the new remote. Pretty
simple.

Hollywood (Avi Nesher), starring people who have had success in
Hollywood (veteran actor Joe Pantoliano, Elizabeth Berkley and
Robert Townsend), ``The Taxman'' shows how Tinseltown sensibilities
can be well thought out even on a low budget.
</P>
<P>
   Pantoliano, last seen in ``The Matrix,'' recaptures the feel of
perhaps his best role, as the bail bondsman in ``Midnight Run''
(1988). This time he's high-strung, overzealous tax investigator Al
Benjamin, who makes it his mission to bring down a complicated
scheme by the Russian mob in New York to siphon off the federal
excise tax imposed on gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Teaming with an earnest young cop, Romero (Wade Dominguez), Al
goes after a Russian gas station owner (Michael Chiklis), whose
engaged daughter Nadia (Elizabeth Berkley _ that's right, the star
of the much-maligned ``Saved by the Bell'' television series and
the motion picture disaster known as ``Showgirls'') catches his
eye.
</P>
<P>
   The two, who are trying to drag themselves into a higher
standing by cracking their first Big Case, get a federal prosecutor
(Robert Townsend) to sign off on the investigation, and go right
after the top man. That takes them into the Russian immigrant
community centered in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Nesher, who has directed several forgettable action movies
(Remember Drew Barrymore in ``Doppelganger'' or Michael Biehn in
``Timebomb''?), reportedly saw the original script by former tax
investigator Roger Berger, which was full of mindless action, and
worked with Berger to craft a more realistic story.
</P>
<P>
   While fresh and fun _ it appears to have been a real treat for
the actors to work on _ ``The Taxman'' isn't the character-driven
indie they would like us to believe it is.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's plot-driven to the point of distraction. Al
constantly complains about the pressures of supporting a wife and
child, but we never meet them. Instead, he seems fixated on a
woman, Nadia, whom he cannot have and with whom there is not even
the pretense of a romantic relationship, or any kind of
relationship, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Berkley, who is called on to deliver lines in Russian, seems
only to be out to prove that she really can act (she can).
Townsend, with ``Hollywood Shuffle'' a dozen years behind him now,
is convincingly low key as the idealistic prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Pantoliano's movie. Al is a man who has to learn that
the relentless pursuit of truth has rules, too. He's an Everyman
hero, who can't dance and is proud of it.

SNOW LIGHTS VISIONS OF GREATNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What felt like a full gale on our salty coast turned into the
white gold upcountry, and the cold weather that followed made for a
real ski weekend. This weekend should repeat.
</P>
<P>
   The report from Bretton Woods was that the skiing was pretty
darn good on half a dozen trails, especially considering winter's
slow start.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Saturday, we had the place to ourselves,'' said Kenny, who
skied with his family for a few days there over the weekend and
into this week. ``The snow was decent, and when my son took a group
boarding lesson he was the only one in the class. A private
lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Bretton Woods was always one of the best snowmakers/groomers in
the business, and a really nice place to begin the season, since
the cruising is on the low-stress side.
</P>
<P>
   My own favorite run at Bretton Woods when I find it relatively
uncrowded and no one is over on the right-side trails is to take
the Granny's Grit top to bottom without a turn. I imagine I am
Peter Mueller gliding down the upper flats of the Aspen downhill
run, then plunging down the face of Aztec.
</P>
<P>
   And now I am flying at heroic speeds, blasting through tight,
tough turns, probably hitting record speeds as I whiz past the TV
towers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the rolls I go, prejumping the lips and keeping my hands
low and well out in front until I come through the finish to the
delight of thousands of ski fans, many of them my teenage
satellites who traveled here from Zurmat to see Pirmin and me strut
our stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the crowd steps the beautiful and talented Edie Thys of
Ski magazine (best writer at any of the major ski magazines) who
sticks her microcassette recorder in my face and asks the
inevitable:
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, Peter. Tell me about your run today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vell, eet vas lack thees,'' I say between deep gulping breaths
after my two-mile flight. But then there is another voice cutting
through this haze of fantastic self-absorbtion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You idiot! You're going to kill yourself one of these days!
What do you think, you're still a college kid?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, my wife is right. A high-speed fall at this age is an
event the body is likely to remember. The bones are more brittle,
less cartilage to elasticize those moving parts.
</P>
<P>
   So why doesn't Nature, with her many designs to protect her
living creatures, curtail the hunger for speed in the soul of every
skier and boarder I know? After all, the beauty and grace in the
sport is at its peak when a body is moving fast enough to feel
almost airborne.
</P>
<P>
   Racers descending those steep icy tracks at 80 miles an hour,
flowing so smoothly with the undulations of mountain terrain,
leaping through the air in hundred-foot bites, create the most
beautiful dance on earth. And great racers like Mueller always
brought to mind the W.B. Yeats line, written about a ballet he
watched: ``I couldn't tell the dancers from the dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, when I once did find myself on the Aspen downhill
course, I did not ski it exactly as I did on Granny's Grit or Coos
Caper at Bretton Woods. Former US Ski Team racer Andy Mill led a
``press inspection'' of the run the morning before a World Cup
downhill race. All was fine out of the starting shack and down the
flats until Mill stopped us on the lip of Aztec, the steep face
that starts the real acceleration into the turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Side slip this part,'' Mill said.
</P>
<P>
   Gleep! See Andy, it's like this, I think looking down this
elevator shaft of a drop: This is pure ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch out, it's icy,'' says Mill, adding with a chuckle,
``just the way the racers like it.''
</P>
<P>
   No description needed here, but suffice it to say the only
reason anyone would have interviewed me after that run was to get
the perspective of the Aspen Winternational snow clown.
</P>
<P>
   But speed is addictive, and the addiction doesn't diminish with
age. Long after we lose our taste for driving fast in cars,
motorboats, motorcycles, snowmobiles and the like, that speed
monster stays alive, well, and ageless in the skier's soul.
Hopefully, at least we learn when and where to indulge it.
</P>
<P>
   Once and only once, in my early twenties, I got my lift ticket
pulled by the ski patrol. It was at Saddleback Mountain in
Rangeley, Maine. I had been racing with fellow University of Maine
student Scott Kauffman, and we had taken White Stallion (then Gray
Ghost) top to bottom. As we braked to a stop at the bottom, some
really mad guy (it could have been Jon Christi himself) gave us a
dressing down and demanded our tickets on grounds of reckless and
dangerous skiing.
</P>
<P>
   He was right, of course. Anyone on the trail in front of us that
day could have . . . well you know. Losing the $3 ticket didn't
hurt. It was near the end of the day anyway. But the guy really
knew how to cut down a couple of young bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you try that again,'' he said, ``at least learn how to
ski.''
</P>
<P>
   Speed. You never get over it.

SEASONED VET MALONE HASN'T MISSED HIS SHOT AT CHAMPIONSHIP YET

<P>
   BOSTON _ Here's an easy one. Which member of the Utah Jazz do
you suppose was lying on his back an hour before the game, tossing
a medicine ball _ some kind of round, oversized object, anyway _
higher and higher as he watched a videotape of the Celtics playing
the Miami Heat?
</P>
<P>
   Could it be the man who was suiting up for the 1,127th time in
1,132 regular-season opportunities over a NBA career that is now in
its 15th season?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I have to do to get ready for a game,'' said Karl
Malone, who would go on to score 27 points as the Utah Jazz beat
the Celtics by a 96-86 score Wednesday night at the Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   That goes for the off-days, when he might be in the weight room,
or stretching, or meditating, or whatever it is that he does
longer, harder, and with more zeal than just about anyone who has
ever played this game. In case you're wondering, that body was
made, not bequeathed.
</P>
<P>
   Malone has been coming to Boston a long time, and not always in
the same circumstance. In his early days, trips to Boston were
ritualistic embarrassments. The Jazz just didn't win in Boston.
They got one in Hartford when Pete Maravich hit them with a
triple-double before we even knew what a triple-double was, but
Boston? Uh-uh. The years rolled on, and the Jazz would get their
annual spanking in the Boston Garden. After one such trashing,
coach Frank Layden responded to the first postgame inquiry by
saying, ``What? Were we supposed to win?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. It didn't matter who joined the team. Adrian
Dantley joined the team in 1979 and they lost. John Stockton joined
the team in 1984 and they lost. Malone joined the team in 1985 and
they lost. And lost. And lost. And lost. And lost. And lost. And,
yes, lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you came in here (i.e. the Garden),'' Malone reminisced,
``you couldn't afford to have any off quarters. We'd have to
execute our plays perfectly every time downcourt in order to have
any chance at all of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Garden losing streak stretched to 20. Finally, on
Nov. 18, 1992, Malone, Stockton, Jeff Malone, and the rest of the
Jazz did what their hoop-loving ancestors had never been able to
do. It was Utah 92, Boston 91, and the team loved the taste of it
so much they have not lost another game in any building to the
Celtics. That's right. The winning streak is now 14.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Karl Malone has cemented his place on the
all-time roster. He is now a two-time MVP. He has been a first-team
All-NBA member a record 11 times. He's got two gold medals. And
with a 19-foot first-quarter jumper against Golden State Nov. 29 he
moved into third place on the all-time scoring list, trailing only
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain. The only meaningful thing
he doesn't have is a championship ring, and he hasn't given up on
that, either.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of many, it's all over for the Utah Jazz. People
say, ``They had their chance,'' alluding to defeats in the NBA
Finals in 1997 and '98. They couldn't get out of the second round
last season, losing to the Portland Trail Blazers in six games. Now
all the talk centers on the Pacific Division, where powerhouses Los
Angeles (18-5) and Portland (17-5) are off to great starts, with
Seattle (16-6), Sacramento (13-6), and Phoenix (14-7) in hot
pursuit. It's as if the Jazz (15-7), who trail San Antonio (17-7)
in the Central by just one game, don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true,'' acknowledged Malone. ``It's not even like we're
lying in the weeds. People have forgotten all about us.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Jazz now have a seven-game winning streak,
and they've been doing it the same old way. ``If you were them,''
inquired Celtics assistant coach John Carroll, ``would you change
anything?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same old, same old,'' added Boston assistant Lester
Connor. ``They're still slicing and dicing you. Pick-and-rolls with
Stockton and Malone. A thousand post-ups for Malone.''
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't post Malone? He seems to be the same player he was
five or 10 years ago, landing in Boston as the league's No. 3
scorer (25.8) and No. 9 rebounder (10.2). No one is in better
shape, and no one intends to be in better shape. The man has just
re-upped for another four years, which will make him 40 years old
and an 18-year NBA veteran when that deal is up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to keep playing this way my whole career,'' he vowed.
``And when I do retire, I'll know I left it all out there, on the
floor. I think I can do it, as long as I keep preparing to play the
way I know how.''
</P>
<P>
   And know-how is a pretty good way of describing the manner in
which he scored his just-showing-up superstar's 27, since he did it
by making just one jump shot and by simply willing himself to the
foul line, where he was 13 for 17. But, hey, he does lead the
league in free throw attempts for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   He never even fantasized about such a career. ``Who could do
such a thing?'' he said. ``I never expected anything like this.
Thinking back from high school, the college, and all this time in
the NBA, it feels like the whole thing is storybook. When it's
over, I'll look back and say, `It's been a hell of a ride, you
know?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Want to talk storybook? How about the Celtics beating him here
one more time before he heads to the ranch, the hills, or wherever
he'll go when it's over?

WHERE THE ROOTS REACH FOR WATER 
A Personal and Natural History of Melancholia 
By Jeffery(cq)  Smith 
North Point Press, 304 pp., $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Antidepressants didn't work for Jeffery Smith. None alleviated
his depression for more than a few months. Not long after one
cocktail of medications induced a paralytic seizure, Smith stopped
taking the things altogether. ``Where the Roots Reach for Water: A
Personal and Natural History of Melancholia'' is Smith's account of
his life in the months that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible for a writer to convey the texture and contour of
depression to readers who have never experienced it? It may be that
depression is a foreign country, a place you can try to imagine but
can never really know until you've been there. To someone who has
more than once pitched her tent in that rough terrain, Smith's
account is authentic, sometimes depressingly so. And it is more
than a story about one man's struggle with his dark side: It's also
a fascinating and highly idiosyncratic exploration of the illness,
its history, and its place in the larger world.
</P>
<P>
   Smith begins with a haunting description of a sudden descent
into depression. Zoloft had granted him a ``glorious reprieve'' for
several months. One day it no longer worked. His psychiatrist
instructed him to double the dosage, but his depression refused to
budge.
</P>
<P>
   Smith neglected his job as a caseworker in a Missoula, Mont.,
mental-health center. His girlfriend broke up with him. He
retreated to his dark basement room, subsisted on watery lentil
soup and burned cheese sandwiches, and tried to shut out the world.
But he couldn't hide from the inner critic he calls Mr. Shoulder,
who whispered into his ear a merciless inventory of his
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Smith plotted suicide. He'd walk into a remote stretch of river,
thinking that ``like Virginia Woolf, I would surrender my weight to
the current.'' Instead, standing alone one night by the same river,
he decided once and for all to quit taking antidepressants. He
tried nonpharmaceutical approaches to his illness _ first
homeopathy, then traditional therapy. When he felt a little better,
he began delving into the history of depression, which he prefers
to call by one of its ancient names, melancholia.
</P>
<P>
   He read up on astrology, and learned that for centuries saying
that someone was born under the sign of Saturn (his own birth sign)
was a shorthand way of saying the person was prone to melancholy.
He learned about the Roman physician Galen's ``humoral'' theory of
medicine, his theory that ``black bile'' (a purely hypothetical
substance) ``darkens the seat of reason.'' He read Hildegard of
Bingen, Dante, Thomas Merton, William James, T. S. Eliot, Susan
Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered that in some cultures there is no word for
depression. In others, the condition is viewed not as an illness
but as ``a more or less `natural' result of the vicissitudes of
life.'' In other times _ ``Ages of Melancholy,'' in Renaissance
Europe and in Elizabethan England, and the reign of the
19th-century Romantics in Germany and Great Britain _ depression
was seen as ``a great gift; painful and trying, yes, but on the
whole a worthwhile experience _ desirable, even.''
</P>
<P>
   Premillennial America is hard on the depressed. ``In spite of
all evidence,'' Smith writes, ``modern-day Americans keep trying to
convince ourselves that happiness is the natural state of our
species.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular notion that all depression can be cured with a pill
is far from true, as Smith testifies. He calls this the Age of
Anti-Depression, a time of a single, reductionist, biochemical
approach to a condition that nevertheless feels unique to each
person who suffers with it.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn back to his family home in the hills of West Virginia,
Smith recognizes one source of his depression: the longing for a
familiar landscape. He also learns that both sides of his family
tree are full of depressed people. It's in his blood, an elderly
aunt tells him. He wonders: Why has depression remained in the
human gene pool? What function does it serve?
</P>
<P>
   As his book closes, 18 months after he quit taking medications,
Smith is learning to live with his depression. He has made a home
with a woman he loves. He has found religion, and a ``sustaining
kinship'' with animals, plants, the landscape, his family, the
past. He has come to see his depression as an excess of self,
something that comes between him and God. He reads Merton still. He
struggles to annihilate will, desire, ego, to avoid ``the cheap,
cowardly out of cynicism.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's destination may not be where every traveler in the
landscape of depression would wish to find himself. But his account
of his journey there is fascinating.

VALVE WILL PREVENT `SHOWER SHOCK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. When others use water in my house, the temperature changes
drastically in my shower, either too cold or too hot. How can that
be fixed?
</P>
<P>
   LILLIAN SHULMAN, Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Install a one-handle valve, which prevents this sudden change
in temperature that has plagued shower users for years. They used
to be called antiscald valves, but now are called pressure-control
valves. They work by adjusting the pressure in the lines when
someone other than the person showering draws water. Such valves
are required in many states in new construction and when replacing
an old valve.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I get a whiff of gas when the shower goes on. What is it, and
what causes it? How can I prevent it from happening?
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Hopkinton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's start with a simple answer and possible solution,
especially since you get no whiff from other sinks or faucets. And,
by whiff I assume you mean it is temporary. If it were sewer gas
coming up from an empty trap, the odor would be continuous. It may
be a dirty drain, full of grease, oil, hair, and other gross
things. When water goes down that drain, its movement causes odor
from this greasy buildup to rise to your unsuspecting nose. The
cure is to clean the drain with bleach and water. Then pour a cup
of bleach down the drain and leave it overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is hydrogen sulfide gas in the water, caused
by bacteria. A dirty aerator (the shower head) could be the cause.
Cleaning it will help.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, hydrogen sulfide is in the water naturally. In that
case, letting the water run a few minutes usually helps.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am bulding a small, one-story house on the Cape. The
specifications call for floor registers for hot-air heat. I was
told that floor registers allow extremes of heat and cold, but
nothing in between. Is that so? If so, how should the registers go?
</P>
<P>
   CONFUSED, on the Cape
</P>
<P>
   A. I think that is an old wives' tale. However, floor registers
do little to distribute the heat properly. You would be better off
with baseboard registers for your hot-air system. These units, 18
inches long, 5 inches high, and 4 inches deep, fit over floor
openings and butt against the wood baseboard. Their fronts are
louvered to distribute air as evenly as a hot-air system can
manage. If I were you, I would insist on baseboard registers. They
are a shade more expensive than floor registers, but are worth it.
And, they will be as easy as the floor ones to install.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever tried to drill a hole in ceramic tile or glass,
and had a devil of a time getting the hole started without the
drill bit walking all over the place? It happens no matter how hard
you try to keep that spinning drill steady.
</P>
<P>
   One way to curb the wayward bit is to apply a piece of duct tape
to the tile or glass. This will hold the drill as you begin. Other
handymen have suggested drilling a small hole in a piece of wood,
laying the wood on the glass or tile, and using the hole to reduce
the drill wobble.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of things will work, and Joe Horner of Belmont, Mass., who
has helped the handyman on occasion, suggested this: Rotate the bit
each way without power, to chip out a tiny bit of glass or tile.
The bit will fit into that tiny chip and stay put as you apply
power. Or, take a nail and tap it ever so slightly to make that
chip.
</P>
<P>
   With the latter approach, you stand a chance of breaking the
glass or tile if you are not careful or just get unlucky.
</P>
<P>
   Another trick: Try drilling and chipping on a scrap. If it works
on a scrap, you can go ahead on the real thing with renewed
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A concrete panel was replaced in my sidewalk, but the new
panel is the wrong color. The panels are 3 feet square, so the new
one really stands out. How can I make them match? What kind of
paint should I use?
</P>
<P>
   WALLY GIANNONE, Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Wait a few years; the panels will match, eventually. Do not
paint; you won't get a match anyway, and with paint, you will have
a perennial chore of scraping and repainting.
</P>
<P>
   If the difference in color really bugs you, try this: Stain the
entire sidewalk with a concrete stain. It won't peel, and the color
will be consistent. You can get any number of colors in the stain
that Muralo makes, sold at paint stores. And, by the time the stain
starts to wear off, the color on all panels will probably be
consistent enough for you to tolerate without restaining.

TUCKING IN THE GARDEN FOR A LONG WINTER'S COMPOSTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As with the rest of life, gardening is a series of transitions
interspersed with occasional lulls of contentment.
</P>
<P>
   Winter to spring, spring to summer, summer to fall, fall to
winter. The drudgery of these busy times tends to be tempered by
excitement over what is to come. Thus, when my back and shoulders
and arms ache from early spring digging and raking and pruning
following a too-sedentary winter, I am nonetheless ebullient at
being back in touch with the earth. I fairly glow at the promise of
the coming season. I dose myself liberally with ibuprofen.
</P>
<P>
   So it is now. As autumn starts to nod off into winter's chill,
it is a last chance to finish closing the garden shop. Leaves must
be raked out of bushes (drooping forsythias embrace oak leaves,
spreading euonymus clutch at the detritus; all must be removed).
</P>
<P>
   The lawn gets a last mowing, with the blade lowered from its
highest setting, where I normally keep it, for a close trim that
must last until spring. There will be warm spells between now and
then, and grass being grass, the lawn will grow. (Fertilizing and
liming was done two months ago.)
</P>
<P>
   I don't rake leaves from the lawn. Instead, I mow them with the
grass and deposit the grounds on various beds where they can rot
down and improve the soil. The backyard mowings go on perennial
beds, not in the vegetable garden, because the dogs have free rein
in the back, and their particular fertilizer is not wanted where we
grow lettuce and such.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby town reside a pair of horses and three donkeys whose
fertilizer is very much wanted. On my annual pilgrimage, I back my
pickup truck up to the manure bin, grab my shovel, chat with the
animals' owner, and begin heaving that heady mix of straw, wood
chips, and poop into the truck bed.
</P>
<P>
   I enjoy this. I break a sweat, take a break, exchange bestial
glances with the horses and donkeys, who have gathered by the
adjacent fence to watch. As I dig into the pile, steam rises from
the heat of composting. The manure smell to me is delicious. It is
a farm smell, a garden smell, the stuff of life. I think I'll make
two trips this year.
</P>
<P>
   The stench is not appreciated by everybody. My wife is never
pleased at the spillage in the driveway when I unload and cart the
manure around in the wheelbarrow. (The dogs, on the other hand,
know just what barn sweepings are for, and I have to make sure they
don't break into the manured beds for a good roll.)
</P>
<P>
   The manure is raked atop the vegetable beds. It will rot down
nicely over the winter. I do not till the beds, but I don't walk on
them either, so they are not compacted. Tilth, soil structure, is
important.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment needs attention now. I clean the lawn mower, give
exposed parts a spritz with an oil spray, remove and sharpen the
blade with a file. The snow blower comes out, is gassed, and starts
on the umpteenth pull (which it won't during a storm a month from
now).
</P>
<P>
   Garden tools are dulled from a season of use. Hoes, shovels,
edgers, trowels need sharpening. I wipe steel parts with
lubricating oil and wood handles with linseed oil cut with paint
thinner. Good tools should last a lifetime. Many of my tools came
from my grandfather's cellar. Others came from my mom's garage
(I'll return them soon; sure I will). Gardening is a matter of
connections.
</P>
<P>
   The first catalogs have arrived (that 2000 on the covers looks
funny). I toss them in a pile. They are for January reading _ and
dreaming. But a warm day now is perfect for a walkabout, notebook
in hand, casting a critical eye on the garden and jotting down
observations.
</P>
<P>
   The dead ornamental plum would support a clematis or two. If I
cover the lawn around it with newspapers under mulch, I can create
a nice, big bed, a home for the lacecap hydrangea I have wanted for
years. Next to the dead tree could go a small ornamental tree,
perhaps a Franklinia alatamaha (white flowers in September and
October, gorgeous orange and red autumn foliage) or a stewartia
(mottled bark, white flowers in July, purple and reddish orange
autumn foliage). When the new tree had some size to it, the
clematis could be retrained to grow up it and the adjacent dead
trunk removed.
</P>
<P>
   Plants have thrived, and plants have died. I take note. I bend
and pull things out, pat things down. Here a quick raking, there a
pruning of a damaged branch.
</P>
<P>
   The pace quickens in these final weeks, and while there is a
sense of satisfaction, it takes a toll on the gardener.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I grin and bear it. Pass the ibuprofen.

STORES REALLY HAVE THE GOODS FOR SKIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While few gifts could be more welcome than one huge honking
blizzard about now, along with a stretch of seasonably cold
weather, the next best thing is slope stuff _ to slide on, to wear,
to play with on the chairlift.
</P>
<P>
   --One of the biggest trends the last five years has been a
takeoff in showshoes. Ever since lightweight plastic and aluminum
arrived on the scene, developed by Tubbs and Atlas, the growth of
snowshoeing is one of those skyrocket success stories.
</P>
<P>
   More and more skiers are picking up snowshoes for walking around
the resort after ski hours or on non-ski days, and every year there
are more choices.
</P>
<P>
   Weight, of course, is a big factor, and retailers have charts to
figure out the right snowshoe for the wearer. But these days,
buyers have to know how their snowshoes will be used _ whether it's
bushwhacking through the deep wilderness with lots of rough terrain
and icy crust, or perhaps fitness walking, or even jogging on
groomed trails or moderately deep snow.
</P>
<P>
   For every specialty there is a snowshoe and a price range. For
kids, the BearCub or new Tubbscout snowshoes run $40 to $80. Tubbs
lower end ``Discovery'' snowshoe costs about $120, while upper end
wilderness and backpacking snowshoes sell for $220 to $250.
</P>
<P>
   For snow joggers, a pair of Premiere Running snowshoes sells for
about $200.
</P>
<P>
   --Cross-country skis and boots offer about the same kind of
variety and price range. Binding systems have evolved from the old
three-pin free-heelers to the extremely lightweight Solomon
boot/binding system common in modern equipment. In any case,
gift-givers should be aware that boots and bindings must be the
same system, and they should not buy skis with bindings unless they
know what boots will be worn with it.
</P>
<P>
   Again, will the skis be used in wilderness touring through
untracked backcountry or skating on groomed tracks? The equipment
differences are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   On one end is the long traditional waxless skis narrow enough to
ski in groomed tracks but long and wide enough to remain stable on
ungroomed snow. With this style ski, there is a range of boot from
leather to Gore-Tex, most of them offering support and stability
for the backcounty. A typical package runs $250 to $400 for
lightweight carbon-fiber skis.
</P>
<P>
   The other extreme in cross-country is the high-tech skating
ski/boot/binding combination used on skating tracks and fast
kick-glide double-trackset skiing. The boots are as light as
running shoes, and a typical combination might feature Rossignol
high-performance waxable-carbon skis with Solomon Active SC binding
and boot combination. A package of this sort runs $350 to $400.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is a pair of the easier-turning skis designed
primarily for groomed tracks, packed fields, snowmobile tracks.
These skis are shorter and wider, and turn much easier than long
ones, snowplow, and herringbone up hills easier than traditional
skis. Adult ski/boot/binding packages run $200 to 250.
</P>
<P>
   --For parents who never quite know what to buy for small
children, former ski racer Steve Lathrop has designed a whole line
of innovative gear.
</P>
<P>
   There is the T-bar for towing kids as young as a year old, the
tip connecters for older kids, and a Kidder Lift _ a device that
helps small children ride the chairlift. The gear starts at around
$25 and is available at Ski Market.
</P>
<P>
   --Still very hot are snowblades, which appeared about five years
ago and are popular among younger skiers, but anyone can use them.
These shorty devices are great for scooting around smaller hills
with a minimum of gear, and they sell for around $170 for a top
Solomon blade.
</P>
<P>
   --Needless to say, before buying skis or a snowboard for
someone, take into account the recipient's abilities and physical
traits. A general recommendation is for skiers and riders to select
their own skis and boards after trying out a few demo models.
</P>
<P>
   But these gifts do look festive under the tree Christmas
mornings, so the next best thing is to have a clear return
agreement at a store with a wide variety of brands and models.
</P>
<P>
   Shaped skis are the norm these days, but there is a wide variety
of shapes, from the extreme for beginners to the moderate and
slight shapes for more advanced skiers.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers should be mindful that eager learners just getting
started may outgrow a pair of extreme sidecut skis in less than a
season; so they are not recommended here. Extreme shapes do allow
faster turning, but after a few days of beginner turns, new skiers
want to add some speed, at which point these extremes become
unstable because they don't track very well.
</P>
<P>
   And one tip for a buyer of shaped skis for an experienced skier
who has always been on traditional skis: Spend the extra $60 for a
one-hour private lesson on the technique nuances that get the most
out of the shaped skis. Usually, it takes no more instruction than
this, but leave it to a pro.
</P>
<P>
   --If the person you are buying for wants ski boots, buy a gift
certificate at a ski store with a wide inventory and trained boot
fitters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ski accessories come in all sizes, shapes, and prices. Here's a
smattering:
</P>
<P>
   --Walkie-talkies allow families and groups to stay in touch
especially at large resorts. These easily fit in the pocket and are
great for groups of mixed abilities who spread out on a mountain
but want to meet for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Bell has walkie-talkies for less than $100 per radio. Kenwood
has a good waterproof unit for $125. Look for external
speaker/microphone features.
</P>
<P>
   --For real gadgeteers, the wrist computer with altimeter is a
must. Suunto makes a good one for around $200, but there are many
on the market. This lets skiers/boarders keep track of how many
miles they have skied in a year, at what elevation they're skiing,
and provides infinite fiddling opportunity on the chairlift.
</P>
<P>
   --Almost every retail shop has a zipper thermometer for less
than $10. It's a very useful stocking stuffer.
</P>
<P>
   --A weather radio is great to have in the hotel room to know
what to expect next day. Many manufacturers offer these. Radio
Shack has one for under $20.
</P>
<P>
   --For night cross-country or snowshoe forays in the woods (these
are fun parties, incidentally), a headlamp is handy. This is a
flashlight that straps onto the head. Made by Lightsource, the
battery-pack model sells for around $50.
</P>
<P>
   --There also are goggles ($20-$50), thermal socks ($15),
polypropelyne long underwear ($30), the Leatherman knife/scissors
tool ($50), and a stainless steel vacuum bottle ($30) to keep
drinks hot while you ski or board.

BRUINS' GOAL: FIND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's no one thing that has tripped up the Bruins during
their 1-4-3 slide. Off the ice, there have been all sorts of
meetings, but they haven't kept the Bruins from falling to sixth
place in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a different aspect the last two weeks,'' said
assistant coach Ken Baumgartner. ``Some nights its goal scoring,
some nights it's point coverage, and other nights it's 2-on-2 and
3-on-3. We have to pick our game up in all aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been this way since a 2-2 tie with the Vancouver Canucks
Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have as many meetings as you want and if it's not being
done on the ice, it doesn't mean anything,'' Sergei Samsonov said.
``I'm sure the guys aren't happy with the way the team is playing
right now. Everybody's trying to chip in and do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will try again twice this weekend, at Atlanta Friday
followed by a visit to St. Louis Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that means that there's no time to think about it,''
Samsonov said. ``Especially on the road. You go out and get 2
points and you try not to give up a lot of chances by not giving up
any goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is the Bruins have never been the type of team
to score a bundle of goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win, 1-0, 2-1, games like that,'' Samsonov said.
``If we score two or three goals a game, we have a real good chance
to win because that's our defensive style. We're sticking to our
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Heinze has been asked about the Bruins' plight before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an excellent question, and if we had the answer, of
course, we'd fix it as soon as we could,'' he said. ``It's basic,
simple hockey we have to play. That's the good equation. We just
have to stick to it. It's the whole package, it's never one thing.
It's 20 guys all sticking to a system and playing well together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have known what the opposition is going to try to do
even before the game gets underway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that we're not executing right now,'' Joe Thornton
said. ``We just have to score one more than the other team. That's
the bottom line. Like against Phoenix (a 2-0 Boston win), we were
shooting the puck, we had a lot of chances while driving hard to
the net, and we did a nice job of keeping the opposition out of the
middle of the ice. We have to get back to that sort of game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just a matter of the players believing they are going to do
it in that particular game. It usually has to do with simple
hockey, playing the game with plenty of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple stuff won for us before,'' said P.J. Axelsson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do our job in the team system and play with some
urgency,'' Joe Murphy said. ``We have to play with some
desperation. Every game you've got to look at like it's a must-win.
We have to go out and have fun. Right now we do it in spurts. One
line does well, the next line does fine, and then we miss the next
two shifts. We don't seem to put it together for the 60 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some games it's a matter of some guys trying to do too much,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not any different than other teams that go through the
highs and lows in a year,'' Rob DiMaio said. ``The key for us is to
play within our system and maybe simplify our game in some ways. We
usually play very solid together. We know exactly what we're
supposed to so. Maybe we're searching for something now to get out
of this and be more effective defensively. We need to find the
happy medium. We have a solid group of guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all of us finding what gives you confidence, with
everybody on top of their game, everybody playing good, solid, high
at a consistent level when we're effective as a team.''

   Jennifer Genest, a public relations executive, is upset. On
crutches with a foot injury, she decided to do her holiday shopping
on line rather than go to the malls.
</P>
<P>
   But when she tried to buy a car racetrack set for her 6-year-old
son, she wound up with a large toy airplane instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total nightmare,'' she said of shopping on line.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston University, e-commerce professor Bruce D. Weinberg has
had a different experience. As of September, he stopped shopping in
brick-and-mortar stores altogether, buying everything from holiday
gifts to tires and light bulbs on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a ton of fun,'' said Weinberg, who added, ``I'm straining
to think of something terrible that happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   With holiday shoppers expected to spend $6 billion to $10
billion this season, anecdotal evidence abounds about retail Web
sites crashing or fouling up orders, but e-commerce analysts claim
on-line shopping is not all that different from shopping in the
real world.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are on-line hassles, analyst said, but there are
hassles at malls and department stores as well.
</P>
<P>
   On-line horror stories have been ``well publicized,'' said Seema
Williams, an analyst at Forrester Research. ``But there have been
no wholesale disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, on-line holiday shopping went mainstream last
year when consumers spent a total of about $3 billion on
holiday-related purchases, according to Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of problems in 1998. Many Web sites couldn't
handle the crush of business. Consumers found some sites hard to
navigate, and other sites couldn't manage to get the right orders
to the right consumers at the right times.
</P>
<P>
   This year, traffic is far heavier. According to Jupiter, 28.8
million consumers will shop on line this year, 10 million more than
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers are seeing exponential jumps. In Waltham, Mass.,
toysmart.com equaled the number of orders it received for all of
December 1998 in the first 30 hours of December 1999, spokesman
Patrick Rafter said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several big retailers have seen traffic to their Web
sites double since October, said Christopher Vroom, an analyst with
Thomas Weisel Partners.
</P>
<P>
   One reason some consumers have problems with retail Web sites
may be that their expectations are too high, said analyst Alan
Alper with Gomez Advisors in Lincoln, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce technology is still ``immature,'' he said, yet some
people expect it to function as smoothly as ``clockwork.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jupiter, the most experienced on-line shoppers know
better than to place too much faith in Web retailers just yet. In a
recent survey, shoppers told Jupiter that they plan to spend less
than 10 percent of their holiday budgets at retail Web sites
because they expect to encounter on-line snafus.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to take a chance that their holiday orders won't
arrive on time _ or that they'll get the wrong stuff _ these
consumers said they plan to do the bulk of their shopping at
old-fashioned stores and malls, Jupiter found.
</P>
<P>
   Given the novelty of on-line shopping, some consumers might
think a mysterious new technology is to blame for most problems.
But the real challenge may be more mundane, and more humbling.
</P>
<P>
   After a consumer hits the ``buy'' button at a Web site, a
retailer must perform a sequence of steps that can add up to a
logistical headache: first, the order must be picked from warehouse
shelves, then it must be properly packed, and finally it must be
turned over to a delivery service such as UPS to get the package to
a consumer's home.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't sound all that difficult, but multiply it many
times over, compress the crunch time into a six-week window, and
order fulfillment can become a daunting task indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Wal-Mart Stores Inc. In the brick-and-mortar world, the
huge retailer is known for its mastery of technology, yet its
retail Web site is not working as smoothly as hoped. Last week,
Wal-Mart posted a note on its Web site saying it can't guarantee
orders will be delivered by Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   Many so-called ``pure-play'' e-commerce retailers _ retailers
that have no stores and sell products only over the Internet _ hire
third parties to handle many order-fulfillment tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as Amazon.com, have invested heavily in building a
network of automated warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Because e-commerce companies employ different strategies and
because some of them execute those strategies much better than
others, a consumer's experience can vary widely from Web site to
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Web is chock-a-block with e-commerce upstarts,
and a post-holiday period of shakeout and consolidation is almost
inevitable, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Vroom believes the survivors will be the Web sites with
which consumers have the fewest hassles, and those probably will be
the ones that have focused the most on the logistics of fulfilling
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Genest, from Stoneham, Mass., had her order fulfilled all right.
It was just that eToys.com, the Web site at which she made her
purchases, sent her a toy airplane instead of toy cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airplane is taking up the better part of my living room,''
she said of the six-foot-long package.
</P>
<P>
   Genest said she has contacted eToys twice by phone. Once she was
put on hold for 30 minutes. If things aren't straightened out by
the weekend, she'll brave the mall, bad foot and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really need a heavy incentive to do this again,'' she said
of on-line shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some customers are experiencing frustrations, and we're
genuinely sorry about that,'' said eToys spokesman Ken Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Coping with a ``significant uptick'' in the number of orders it
has received, eToys is working ``24 hours a day seven days a week''
on service and delivery and is dedicated to improving all aspects
of its shopping experience, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts consider eToys to be one of the best e-commerce
retailers and they agreed with Ross's claim that bad experiences at
the eToys Web site is the exception and not the rule.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, BU professor Weinberg said he's had mostly good
shopping experiences on line. Amazon.com and Landsend.com are among
the sites that have impressed him.
</P>
<P>
   For many e-commerce retailers, a bigger challenge may come after
Christmas, when many consumers attempt to return and exchange
gifts, said Alper, the Gomez analyst.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, many Web sites suffer from growing pains, but
eventually the best ones will get it right, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Alper, ``The time savings and convenience'' that on-line
shopping offers to consumers ``are too much to give up on.''

SILICON VALLEY A HIGH-TECH PARADISE LOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ When HotDispatch, a young Internet
company founded in Cambridge, was asked by its investors to move to
Silicon Valley, it was confirmation of the West Coast region's role
as the epicenter of high tech.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened.
</P>
<P>
   All of HotDispatch's technical talent refused to go along.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction was: Are you joking?'' Scott McKay, senior
engineer at HotDispatch, said of the proposal to move his entire
company westward. ``Ten years ago, people were touting Silicon
Valley as a new earthly paradise. Now, it's more than filled up,
and the quality of life is substantially lower because so many
people got on the bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   The result: HotDispatch ended up with a split existence _ sales,
marketing and headquarters in Mountain View and engineering in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise at HotDispatch reflects an increasing uneasiness
among technology companies and their employees to move to Silicon
Valley, where the cost of housing is among the highest on the
planet and a 30-minute commute can easily grind into a three-hour
gridlocked ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Congestion and the high cost of living and doing business are
nothing new to this region, but the price of Silicon Valley's
success has become acutely evident the last few years amid the
Internet boom fuelling the region's economy. As a result, high-tech
companies and their workers increasingly are shunning the Valley
for places ranging from Montana to Texas _ and even Massachusetts,
which is near the top of cost charts.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Bay Area continues to be the undisputed mecca
for technology start-ups, on course to attract $10 billion in
venture capital this year, or one-third of the nation's start-up
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the bravo, however, many business and civic leaders here
are quietly worried that, unless dramatic improvements are made in
the area's quality of life, Silicon Valley may become a victim of
its own success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, part of convincing workers to relocate here is
to get them to agree to getting half the home they had at twice the
price. The people you want don't fall for that very long,'' said
Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group,
an organization that represents 150 of the largest high-tech
employers in the Valley, including Hewlett-Packard Co., Apple
Computer Inc., Intel Corp., and Cisco Systems Inc. ``It is an issue
we have to tackle in order to maintain the economic miracle of the
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For many companies, the lack of employee loyalty _ compounded by
today's hot job market _ in the Valley is the biggest turnoff, said
David Orfao, who has worked on both coasts and is now chief
executive of Allaire Corp. in Cambridge. In two years, Allaire's
turnover rate among its 300 employees is less than one percent,
compared to the double-digit attrition rates often experienced by
high-tech companies in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when Allaire was a start-up in Minneapolis, its
founders were debating whether to relocate to the Boston area or
Silicon Valley. The company even signed a lease for office space in
Mountain View, but backed out because it found more ready access to
executive talent in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people in the Valley have a 24- to 36-month time horizon
when they're working for a company,'' Orfao said from Cambridge.
``Out here, people are far more open to committing to a five-year
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Maeder, managing partner of Highland Capital, a venture
capital firm with offices on both coasts, put it this way:
``Silicon Valley has twice the talent as anywhere else, hands down.
But the talent is almost impossible to keep. They cost twice as
much to hire, and you can only keep them for half as long.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a torrid employment market in the Valley has
meant that workers can hop from job to job ``without changing car
pools,'' as one executive told University of California at Berkeley
professor AnnaLee Saxenian in her book, ``Regional Advantage:
Culture and Competition in Silicon Valley and Route 128.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the challenges he would face to pay and retain
employees, Greg Gianforte, founder and chief executive of RightNow
Technologies Inc., skipped the Valley altogether. In March 1998,
Gianforte started RightNow, a profitable Internet software company,
in Bozeman, Montana, a place he fell in love with while on a field
trip to the city in junior high school.
</P>
<P>
   For the vast majority of customers, RightNow is able to market,
install and support its products _ almost entirely over the
Internet. ``The Internet removes geography from the whole business
equation,'' Gianforte said.
</P>
<P>
   Gianforte delights in spurning Silicon Valley. ``I really
believe Silicon Valley is the wrong place to do a start-up,'' he
said. ``There is a shortage of people in the Bay Area. When demand
outstrips supply, that creates chaos. Salaries are out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   He insists that his company's location hasn't hindered his
ability to recruit employees, many of whom are drawn to the outdoor
activities available in rural Montana. His company's Web site
beckons workers with a large photo of Bozeman at the foot of
snowcapped mountain ranges. ``You could live here!'' blares a
caption.
</P>
<P>
   For companies outside ofn Valley, the call of the wild _
or at least a more balanced life _ has succeeded in snagging
technology employees yearning for less stressful careers, shorter
commutes, or more buying power than is possible in the Bay Area,
where the average sales price of a single family home in Palo Alto
in November hit $899,255, up nearly 30 percent over last year's
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It discourages people from coming to work here, and eventually
it will cause a problem in bringing good people to work in the
high-tech industry,'' said Douglas Tobin, president of the Santa
Clara County Association of Realtors in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin recalls spending a day last year ferrying an engineer from
Dallas who had just gotten a substantial job offer from a Silicon
Valley semiconductor company. The engineer brought pictures of his
Dallas home, a two-year-old, 4,000-square-foot house on a half acre
of land that was valued at about $225,000. To get a comparable
house in Los Altos, an enclave for Valley executives, the engineer
would have had to spend $1.5 million. ``He just said `no way' and
went back to Texas,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   The high cost of housing has led to another problem _ the
displacement of teachers, artists, firefighters, public servants
and others not employed in technology. The average tenure of a
teacher in Silicon Valley is a mere four years. The main reason
teachers cite for leaving the Valley: the high cost of homes,
according to Guardino. His organization is lobbying for a
regionwide program to subsidize closing and down payment costs _ up
to $10,000 _ for each teacher who remains in the area for at least
5 years. The fledgling program, funded with city money, was adopted
in San Jose in February and so far has attracted 350 applicants.
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't just housing. In Silicon Valley, rush hour begins
at 6 a.m. on some major freeways. Orfao, who lived in Los Altos,
said he saw his commute to San Jose double from 20 minutes to 40
minutes over a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, many companies still go to great lengths to establish some
presence in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where it's happening,'' said William Davidow, general
partner of Mohr, Davidow Ventures in Menlo Park, Calif. ``By not
being here, you're going to have to work harder to have access to a
whole infrastructure for building your business.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the Valley's critical mass of high-tech companies that has
allowed the area to excel, according to Saxenian's book, ``Regional
Advantage.'' The proximity of so many companies, from chipmakers to
software vendors, gives Silicon Valley firms easy access to both
customers and business partners.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Silicon Valley business leaders realize that
the area's future preeminence will be determined by how it
addresses the increasingly prohibitive cost of living and doing
business here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger for Silicon Valley is internal, not external,''
said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of
the California Economy in Palo Alto. ``The things that human
resources managers are most worried about are housing, education
and transportation. The growth here has raced ahead of the region's
ability to build infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenges we face are due to our own success,'' said
Guardino. ``As long as we focus on solving these problems, we'll
continue to be a success. If we get cocky, we'll fail.''

HARVARD'S SAHLMAN SAYS BAH-HUMBUG TO RISING PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The inflation numbers continue to look good, but that hasn't
stopped investors and the Federal Reserve from worrying that the
strong economy will soon trigger rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   William Sahlman thinks such fears are overblown. ``The US
economy is just fine, thank you,'' he writes in the latest issue of
the Harvard Business Review. ``In fact, it's never been better _
sturdy, resilient, and raring to grow. And it will remain that way
for years to come if the government just manages to stay out of its
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The source of Sahlman's optimism is the new economy and the way
it is transforming companies, new and old. As a professor of
entrepreneurial finance at the Harvard Business School, Sahlman is
in a good spot to watch the new economy in action. Many of the men
and women running today's start-ups are his former students.
</P>
<P>
   We sat down with Sahlman earlier this week to get his take on
the economy, the Internet, and stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You seem pretty convinced inflation is not as big a problem
as it once was.
</P>
<P>
   A. My assertion is that it is very hard for companies to raise
prices when confronted with the massive levels of entry into new
businesses and the massives degree of reengineering we are seeing.
And I am not just talking about the Internet. I have been involved
with a 120-year-old company in Marlborough that makes industrial
sanitary supplies: basic stuff. Is it possible for them to raise
prices? The answer is no. The competition they face is vicious. So
what do they do? They figure out how to become more efficient and
effective than they would otherwise be. You pick your sector, the
revolution is present.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does the Internet accelerate this process?
</P>
<P>
   A. When I talk about the Internet I compare it to Jurassic Park
when the force field comes down and the raptors run loose. Imagine
that companies for 100 years have tried to build a brand identity
and physical barriers to entry: the best locations in the mall or
whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Then along comes the Internet and switches off the force field
that has been protecting all these companies. The raptors attack
the inefficiencies and reorganize the economy. I cannot overstate
the impact of the Internet. I believe it is as important as
electricity or the railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are the changes you talk about strictly American ones?
</P>
<P>
   A. The last e-mail I got was from Chile. They wanted to know if
they could translate an article of mine about writing business
plans. Just as television and music have revolutionized culture in
other countries, so will the Internet. In fact, outside the United
States, where the inefficiencies are far greater than here, you
will see these tools have a bigger impact. Take Japan, where partly
by political choice, consumer goods are relatively expensive. You
can't protect that inefficient system in the world of the Internet
and Federal Express. It goes away. If you look at our international
students, they used to want to stay in the US. Now many want to go
back to their home country and apply what they have seen here.
</P>
<P>
   Q. There have been some pretty radical changes in the past few
years at Harvard Business School. A big percentage of your students
are creating dot.com firms, right?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think cultures ever change. If you go back 50 years,
about half our students always wound up in entrepreneurial settings
10 or 15 years after they graduated. What is so amazing with our
current generation of students is that everything is happening so
much more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Today people are able to get access to critical resources _
customers, money, employees, suppliers _ when they are 27
years-old, not 40 years-old. They are skipping a lot of the
intermediate steps our graduates used to take.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Won't that cause problems?
</P>
<P>
   A. Of course it will. We will see lots of mistakes being made.
Lots of companies will fail. When you are young and moving quickly,
sometimes you haven't been there before or seen how things play
out. No doubt many people, including some of our graduates, will be
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You are not suggesting that these students should be moving
slowly?
</P>
<P>
   A. It turns out you cannot go slowly today. There are few slow
paths to success. In fact, the slow path is a quick path to
failure. That happens to be a characteristic of an economy that so
many smart people are trying to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In your article you suggest that our willingness to tolerate
failure in the US is one of our competitive advantages.
</P>
<P>
   A. In Japan if you fail you can become a bank guard _ in the
United States. Throughout the world, failure is disastrous, social,
politically, economically. Here we reward people for working hard
and trying things. We don't penalize them unless they cheat.
Failure is an opportunity to have learned on someone else's nickel.
I am perfectly happy, and the venture capital community is
perfectly happy, to take someone from a company that hasn't worked
out and use that experience to advantage next time around. It is
one of the fundamental characteristics of this economy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Presumably investors in some of these new companies will wind
up with failed investments.
</P>
<P>
   A. If you go back in the history of markets, there have always
been times when people were convinced every company would succeed.
It might have been computer retailers, or the makers of computer
workstations or disk drives. The fact is, with the benefit of
hindsight, some companies did well and many failed. We have not
suspended those laws this time around. They always hold.

TEBUCKY JONES FINALLY GETS HIS CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Based on the grief he gets from the media
know-it-alls and fans, Tebucky Jones probably had every right to
tell Patriots director of public relations Stacey James to stuff
his request for a press conference in some hurtful place.
</P>
<P>
   If Jones were a vengeful man, he wouldn't have stood at the
podium at Foxboro Stadium Wednesday before the vast majority of his
accusers who think he's not an NFL cornerback, never mind share his
feelings and opinions about replacing the injured Ty Law for the
remainder of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones is not vengeful. He has always been impervious to
criticism about why he can't play the position. Those judgments are
based on a small sample size of opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jones will have ample opportunity to show what he can do.
</P>
<P>
   Law will be lost for 2-4 weeks after undergoing a surgical
procedure on his broken right hand Wednesday at Massachusetts
General Hospital to stabilize the three pins that were dislodged in
Sunday's loss to the Indianapolis Colts. Law will not be placed on
injured reserve in the hope that he can return if the Patriots make
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why be nervous?'' said Jones, the Patriots' second first-round
pick (No. 22 overall) in 1998. ``It's my opportunity to go out
there and put it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones played most of three quarters Sunday at Steve Israel's
left corner spot after Israel sprained his left ankle. Jones was
called for a pass interference.
</P>
<P>
   At times during the season, the 6-foot-2-inch, 215-pound native
of New Britain, Conn., has played in nickel packages. On tight
coverage, he has the tendency to hold onto a receiver for too long.
Some question his recovery speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish . . . like a lot of guys . . . if they had thrown me in
there before this, I'd be way ahead of where I am now,'' said
Jones, a man of few words. ``With Steve and Ty playing ahead of me,
it's been tough getting that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell called
Jones's play ``disappointing.'' But a week after making those
comments, Jones had returned to the spot in the nickel package that
he had lost to Kato Serwanga.
</P>
<P>
   Jones makes no apologies for what some perceive as his slow
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a running back all of my life and then I played safety
one year (at Syracuse) because I didn't want to split time with
three running backs in my senior year,'' he said. ``I don't pay
attention to what other people say about me. I was drafted for the
second-hardest position on the field, a position I'd never played
before. I didn't care where I played as long as I played
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll has defended drafting Jones out of Syracuse
all along and even now says, ``Buck has been a productive player
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true Jones has been one of the team's top special teams
cover men. He has, and will again Sunday against Philadelphia, be
back on kickoffs along with Tony Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones will be measured against how he performs against Eagle
receivers Torrance Small and Na Brown. Fans can expect a more
physical approach from Jones than Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot from Ty, but my style and his style are
different,'' said Jones. ``I'm going to be right there on the line
with their receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Any time there's an inexperienced cornerback on the field, the
opposition usually goes after him on the game's first play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should come after me,'' Jones said. ``I'm hoping to get a
couple of picks.''

THE DANGER OF ONLINE VOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mightier than the tread of armies is the power of a bad idea
whose time has come. But perhaps it isn't too late to stop one
dreadful idea that is already on the march: the belief that
democracy would be enhanced by allowing people to vote over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the town of Shelton, Wash., became the first
to allow voters to cast ballots by computer. In Arizona's
Democratic primary next March, as many as 50,000 Arizona voters
will be permitted to vote by Internet from their home or office
computers. Last month, Iowa tested an e-vote system with online
hookups at polling places.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon plans to let several hundred overseas soldiers cast
e-votes in next year's elections. Statewide online voting is under
consideration in California, Minnesota, Virginia, and Florida _ and
even in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In a new book, ``Vote.com'' (Renaissance Books), Dick Morris
bangs the drum for online democracy. ``In time,'' asserts Bill
Clinton's erstwhile pollster, ``the Internet will replace the
voting machine. It will become the ballot box. . . . It will be a
healthy shot in the arm for a democracy increasingly devoid of
passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Now where have we heard that before?
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, we were told that lowering the voting age to 18
would be a healthy shot in the arm for America's disaffected
democracy. Later it was motor-voter _ allowing anyone to register
to vote when getting a driver's license or applying for welfare _
that was touted as an elixir for American democracy. Last November,
Oregonians approved yet another remedy _ scrapping voting booths
and conducting all elections by mail. ``Vote-by-mail enhances the
democratic process,'' enthused Oregon's secretary of state, Phil
Keisling. ``It saves money, increases participation, and helps our
democratic system of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying all these supposed panaceas is the belief that if
only voting were made easier, more people would vote. And in a
country with chronically low voter turnout, the argument runs,
anything that boosts voter participation is good.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of these silver bullets has quite done the
trick. Enfranchising 18-year-olds proved only that the vast
majority of 18-year-olds won't vote. Motor-voter sent registrations
soaring, but turnout continued to drop. In the last congressional
election, only 36 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot, the
lowest level in 56 years.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps vote-by-mail or Internet voting will reverse the trend.
Doubtless it is easier to cast a ballot when all you have to do is
lick a stamp or click a mouse. But why exactly are we so desperate
for the ballots of people who won't vote unless voting is made
utterly effortless? Is democratic self-rule enhanced by pandering
to people who can't be bothered to get off the couch and go to a
polling place once a year?
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is turning Election Day into junk mail: Everyone is
mailed a ballot whether they want it or not. Now Dick Morris and
his ilk want to trivialize it even further by turning it into _
well, into one of those ubiquitous ``interactive'' polls like the
ones Morris features on his own Web site. These are the sort of
polls that name Alan Keyes the runaway winner of the GOP debates
and Elvis Presley as Man of the Century.
</P>
<P>
   It's curious that those who believe a high voter turnout is the
sine qua non of civic health never propose paying people to vote.
Offer $10 to every citizen who shows up on Election Day, and
nonvoters would come out in droves. Better still, slap a fine on
anyone who fails to vote. That, would send turnout soaring, too.
</P>
<P>
   Of course bribing voters with cash would demean elections.
Making the vote compulsory would be an affront to our traditions.
But is it any less demeaning to keep scrounging for ways to wheedle
votes out of people who couldn't care less about elections? And
could there be any colder assault on tradition than to abolish the
ancient practice of coming together in public to choose our
leaders?
</P>
<P>
   ``The mechanics of voting,'' Swarthmore professor Rick Vallely
writes in The New Republic, ``are still explicitly designed to
remind us that, in principle, we are all equal members of a
political community. On Election Day, we must leave our homes and
offices, travel to a polling place, and physically mingle with
people who are plainly our equals that day, no matter what other
differences we have.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a grave eloquence to the act of voting in public. We
are so used _ those of us who vote _ to standing in line until it
is our turn to be escorted to the voting booth that we forget how
precious the rituals of Election Day really are. Think back to 1994
and those stunning scenes of black South Africans standing in
endless queues, inching forward under a burning sun, waiting for
the chance to cast their first votes as equal citizens. There is
beauty and power in democracy made visible; we would be much the
poorer without it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we can do away with the voting booth. We can replace
Election Day with mass-mailed ballots and envelopes. We can even
dispense with the envelopes and reduce voting to a few clicks on
the home computer. Maybe some marginal voters will bestir
themselves and we'll gain a few points in turnout. But we will have
lost something invaluable, and our democracy will be sorely
diminished.

JAN. 3 COULD BE FIRST TRUE TEST OF Y2K READINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With only 16 days remaining before Jan. 1, 2000, the
conventional wisdom about the pending impact of the Y2K software
bug goes something like this: Party first, fret later.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the message from consumers, who don't seem to be
stocking up on bottled water and canned goods. Not so with
champagne. ``It's a very good year,'' said Gino Pignone, general
manager at Blanchard's Liquors Inc. in Boston, which reports strong
sales of the beverage lately.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's celebrants should have plenty of company, because a
consensus among local utility and bank executives, software
consultants, and federal planners holds that few major disruptions
will strike on New Year's Day in New England and the rest of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest tests may come as business and stock markets
reopen Monday, Jan. 3. Then, minor problems are expected to crop up
at thousands of smaller companies, schools, and other
organizations, ranging from payroll disruptions to manufacturing
problems and lost grades. The cumulative impact of these problems
is hard to forecast but could be significant. Also, the picture is
more confused overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to be confident that the basic infrastructure of
the US is going to function,'' said John Koskinen, President
Clinton's chief Y2K adviser, in a recent interview. ``Our concern,
from a global perspective, is that a series of otherwise manageable
problems might tax the systems as they cut across economic
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Most organizations ``will experience only limited damage from
the Y2K bug,'' according to a report issued Monday in Washington by
a United Nations Y2K center. ``The combination of a great deal of
dedicated effort, the limited use of digital controls in most
infrastructures, and society's general resilience mean that,
although there will be many Y2K-caused errors, the combined
negative effect of these errors will be moderate,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasting the impact of Y2K has become a cottage industry
among computer specialists and public officials trying to minimize
the impact of the software flaw. The problem stems from the
convention among many older software programs to represent the year
with only two digits. Left unfixed, the condition could lead to
disruptions everywhere from cash machines to power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have spent billions of dollars on software repairs as
a result and, since the end of June, institutions including New
England's major water and power utilities and banks have said they
met upgrade deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   The progress among smaller companies is much more difficult to
gauge, however. A survey released last week by the National
Federation of Independent Business, which represents firms with
fewer than 100 employees, showed 26 percent have no plans to check
their computers prior to Jan. 1, up from 21 percent last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more worrisome than if they were doing something about
it,'' said spokesman Jim Weidman.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the UN's Y2K center in Washington was to release a report
Thursday warning that upgrade work must continue at nuclear power
plants worldwide, even after New Year's Day, to prevent Y2K-related
problems from reducing safety margins.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, forecasts about possible disruptions can have an
impact on decisions by consumers and businesses as to how much
food, fuel, and cash to stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Hoarding itself could prove disruptive. But partly because of
the rosy outlook described by Koskinen and others, it seems, locals
banks including Fleet Boston Financial and Citizens Financial Group
report no increase in cash withdrawals lately.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespeople for Stop &AMP; Shop Supermarket Co. and Shaw's
Supermarkets Inc. say items such as bottled water and canned goods
don't seem to be selling any more than usual. Other retailers
including Hannaford Bros., Poland Spring Water Corp. and BJ's
Wholesale Club Inc. report higher-than-expected sales, but decline
to quantify the increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see a buying frenzy,'' said Ann Davin, spokeswoman
for Gillette Co.'s Duracell battery brand.
</P>
<P>
   To some observers, the lack of a clear sales boom suggests
officials have not done enough work to encourage preparations,
beyond suggesting households keep three to seven days' food, water,
and cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that preventing panic was more important than
solving the problem has won out,'' said Leon Kappelman, a professor
at the University of North Texas who has advised government
planners on Y2K. ``I hope that was a good decision; I don't think
it was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen says he sees no basis for greater calls for alarm,
however, and even many skeptics say they don't expect most
Y2K-related problems to strike major cities and corporations on New
Year's Day. In fact, fewer than 10 percent of Y2K-related failures
will occur in the two weeks surrounding Jan. 1, according to a
report by the Gartner Group consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Capers Jones, a computer scientist at Artemis Management Systems
in Burlington, said he is most worried about the impact Y2K might
have on local utilities, water systems, chemical companies, and
smaller municipalities that haven't spent the resources addressing
the problems.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases these problems might not become apparent until
mid-January, he said. By that time, payroll or billing systems
could break down. Plus, there is too little hard data about the
preparations by individual companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of agree with people like Koskinen'' that disruptions
won't be major at first, Jones said. ``But as you drop down into
the medium to small companies, the availability and quality of the
data about what's going to happen to them becomes useless or
dreadful.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he notes the Massachusetts Emergency Management
Agency hasn't rated the preparations of municipalities around the
state, making it hard to know which are most vulnerable to
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Judge, a spokesman for the emergency agency, says that's
fine because state officials have met with representatives from
each of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts this year to
review their Y2K plans. Often this meant making sure officials had
current phone numbers for local residents with generators to loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gone in and audited the results, so it's easy to
take shots,'' Judge said. ``But local officials will have to speak
to somebody, so there's going to be a lot of accountability if
things go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Val Asbedian, a Massachusetts planning official charged with
leading the Cellucci administration's response to Y2K, says he's
chiefly concerned that water, electricity, and telecommunications
systems function into the new year. And now that he's heard
assurances from Boston Edison parent NStar, Bell Atlantic, and
other providers, he's not so concerned about what else might occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the water pumps, and the lights and phones are working,
most anything else that happens is something that's going to be
manageable,'' he said.

WHITE ACTIVISTS FIGHT RACISM WITH COLOR

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Horace Seldon has witnessed it all. The race riots. The
violence over court-ordered busing. The March on Washington. So it
is with a twinge of skepticism that he views the relatively placid
state of race relations in America today.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Seldon's experience with the civil rights movement
that has fostered an unusual union with a wide-eyed young man named
Ian White Maher.
</P>
<P>
   Maher represents a new generation of civil rights activists _ he
grew up after the death of Jim Crow laws and came of age after the
convulsions of the busing era. He has always mingled with
minorities, and, like some in his generation, finds it difficult to
accept that racism remains an issue in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Seldon, 76, and Maher, 27, have bridged the generational gap to
devise a plan to fight institutional racism, which is defined by
them as a system where policy decisions of institutions negatively
affect minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Their weapon in this war: the color of their skin.
</P>
<P>
   The two are using their whiteness to challenge other white
people to see the privileges that come with being white. They have
chosen to do so through speeches and in classrooms, and through a
quarterly newsletter Maher founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they not only don't understand it, but don't want to
understand it,'' said Seldon, who in 1968 founded Community Change,
a nonprofit group working to eradicate racism. ``There's a kind of
built-in resistance because if they understand, it will demand
change.''
</P>
<P>
   The message of racial equality is not new, but Maher and Seldon
want to reach those who have misunderstood or rejected the same
lessons preached by black activists for years. Maybe with a
different messenger, they say, more white people, particularly the
next generation of decision makers, may be willing to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Gill, an associate history professor at Tufts University,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Some audiences are more sympathetic to a person who looks like
them with a similar background, he said. For example, a white
person from South Boston talking about race relations might be
better accepted than a person of color, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can ignore what doesn't touch upon their daily life,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``white privilege'' Maher and Seldon speak of will continue
to cause racial divisiveness in this country, they say, unless
white people acknowledge it and make personal changes. ``Black
people have been saying this for a long time and now a young
27-year-old steps in and suddenly it's, `One of us is stepping up.
Maybe I should listen,' '' Maher said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Maher launched Birth Rights, a quarterly newsletter
distributed to subscribers and coffee shops in the Boston area.
Each issue features a first-person account of local civil rights
activists describing how racism affected their lives, and directs
readers to discussions, classes, conferences, and other
opportunities to talk about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Seldon, who has taught the course ``History of Racism'' at
Boston College for years, serves as a mentor and guide on racial
issues for Maher. Both also work for the state parks department as
tour guides on the Black Heritage Trail.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to their work has been mixed. Seldon has overheard
derogatory comments and some of his students, black and white,
refuse to accept a white person teaching about racism. Maher and
Seldon have received hate mail.
</P>
<P>
   They understand the difficulty people have accepting their
message. Both vividly recall the moment when they finally grasped
the concept of institutional racism and white privilege.
</P>
<P>
   For Maher, it was two years ago while working with a nonprofit
health care organization in the Dominican Republic. He said he was
compartmentalizing the blacks into categories, but was not doing
the same to whites.
</P>
<P>
   Seldon learned about racism while working with black high school
students through a United Church of Christ outreach program in the
1960s. ``I'm forever greatful to them,'' Seldon said. ``I began to
see what institutional racism was _ although at the time I didn't
use that term _ and institutional sexism. I watched desegregation
unfold in Boston and it just taught me an immense lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Maher knows history is the best teacher and feeds from Seldon's
extensive experience, but is quick to note this generation's
challenges are unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents had to go through this thing where they had to make
themselves believe that blacks and Latinos and Natives were equal
to them,'' he said. ``That fight isn't my fight; it was my parents.
What I have to do is attack the underbelly of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, history plays a significant role in current affairs,
Maher and Seldon say. Unwillingness to acknowledge it, they say,
could hinder the learning process or slow progression regarding the
understanding of racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many people willing to dismiss the historical
perspective and too many saying if `I wasn't involved, therefore I
shouldn't be held accountable,' '' Gill said. ``But you need to
have it brought up to show the continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldon added that inaccurate information is just as damaging.
Some students in his classes have shaped their ideas and values
around incorrect or incomplete accounts that, in many ways, suggest
whites are superior to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history books are full of misinformation so they've gotten
that all through high school, and before that, and even college,''
said Seldon. ``It just escalates and keeps accumulating, and you
get people who don't know history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another illustration of the institutional racism issue,''
he said.

THE HONDA INSIGHT HYBRID CAR IS A REAL CAR, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever the prospect of driving an alternative energy vehicle
arises, two fair questions are inevitable: Does it drive like a
real car? How much hassle is it to keep it charged/ juiced/gassed?
</P>
<P>
   With the new Honda Insight, the first gasoline-electric hybrid
auto sold in the United States, the answers to those questions are:
Yes, remarkably so. And, no problem at all because any gasoline
station will do.
</P>
<P>
   I spent more than a week in Honda's spiffy two-seater and found
it had no problems climbing country hills, cruising effortlessly on
the highway, and, when the need arose, running nimbly where the big
dogs roam out in the passing lanes on the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   So yes, this is a real car. In the past, alternative energy
vehicles meant buyers paid a price in performance, convenience, or
comfort _ suffering for the environment. A noble cause, but when
real rubber met the road, not many people were willing to suffer
quite that much.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the future, if _ and this is the big if _ enough
drivers in the United States will turn at least partially away from
the big-rig fever that engulfs us and scoop up hybrids like the
Insight, Toyota's soon-to-be-available Prius, or myriad other
hybrid vehicles, including pickup trucks, sedans, or SUVs, that
will make their way to market by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The Insight, already on sale in California and in the East in
January, is a bargain right now at about $19,500. Honda
acknowledges it is selling the Insight at a loss, but says that is
because the car is a rolling technology platform, an investment
toward the day when buyers may line up to purchase Insights or
other Honda products with Insight's hybrid influence.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, they just want to get people into the Insight
to show what it can do.
</P>
<P>
   Again, this is a real car. It's a three-door hatchback that
seats two quite comfortably. Standard equipment includes power
windows and power steering, remote keyless entry, and antilock
brakes.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, it has a bit of a schizophrenic appearance. Up
front, it looks like any other Honda rolling toward you. Directly
from the rear, it looks Honda all the way. But from the sides,
especially the rear quarter panels with melded fender skirts, it
shrieks different, experimental _ too bad because all else is so
subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, you feel as if you could be sitting in any small Honda.
</P>
<P>
   The seats are broad, long, and firm, and driver and passenger do
not rub shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Instruments are simple and literally engaging. RPMs in a circle
to the left, charge status of the batteries in a circle to the
right, speedometer in a circle at center. But below these three is
where true engagement begins. Here you find a moving bar-graph that
tells you, as you give gas, let off on gas, coast, roll, draft
behind a truck, exactly what gasoline mileage you are getting at
that moment.
</P>
<P>
   You can't help but play with the gauge and even if you are not
out to set mileage records _ I was not and still averaged 61 miles
per gallon in more than a week of driving _ you find yourself
paying attention to the fuel you burn.
</P>
<P>
   Honda did this on purpose _ just as it added several ways to
figure average mileage over specific trips or the life of the car.
</P>
<P>
   So you're on a trip, rolling easily in highway traffic. Your
luggage is on the broad, flat deck above the battery pack behind
the seats. Trip incidentals fit nicely in a webbed pouch that hangs
behind and between the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Your 10.6-gallon gasoline tank has just been filled, your
battery pack is being regularly recharged, and you won't need to
pull into another gas station for well over 600 miles.
</P>
<P>
   How can this be?
</P>
<P>
   Think small gasoline engine, small electric motor, nimble
5-speed manual transmission, and ultra-lightweight materials in
engines, chassis, and suspension. Think aerodynamics (remember
those ugly rear quarter panels?).
</P>
<P>
   In hybrid autos, the electric motor assists the gasoline motor
in times of greatest need: acceleration, starting from a from a
standing stop, climbing steep grades. In the Insight (and this
differs from the Prius) the electric motor never is the sole source
of propulsion. This means the electric motor and the battery pack
can be kept small. And so can the gasoline engine.
</P>
<P>
   The Insight has a 1-liter, 3-cylinder, 67 horsepower, gasoline
engine. Mounted between it and the transmission is a round (small
pizza), 10-kilowatt electric motor that produces 13 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   The only time you notice something is different while driving is
when the car goes into idle stop _ and you put it there when you
come to a stop in traffic, shift into neutral, and let out the
clutch. The gasoline motor stops, but comes on again as soon as you
depress the clutch and shift into gear. Seamless, and it saves
gasoline sitting in traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   So you get your gasoline at stations, as always. But where do
you get a constant supply of electricity? It's called regenerative
braking. When you are applying the brakes, letting off the gas to
slow down in traffic, or the car is holding itself back on steep
downgrades, the electric motor runs in ``reverse.'' Remarkably, it
captures the energy created from all these braking procedures,
converts it to electricity, and stores it in the 144 D-cell sized
batteries that run that same electric motor on demand.
</P>
<P>
   Two small motors helping each other _ small not only because of
that symbiotic relationship, but also because of Honda's use of
lightweight materials in the Insight.
</P>
<P>
   Take the gasoline engine: 124 pounds, aluminum block, die-cast
one-piece aluminum head and exhaust manifold, plastic-resin intake
manifold, valve cover and water pump pully, magnesium oil pan.
Plunk this into an all-aluminum body and chassis, and you've got a
car that weighs about one ton.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 4-wheel independent suspension is made with aluminum
components _ you've got struts up front, a beam axle in the rear _
and they give the car a smooth, mostly sure ride. Only in the
corners did it seem a little too light on its feet, tracking just a
bit outside the steering line sometimes, and tracking a bit inside
the line on others. But, hey, it's not a car built for rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Honda hopes to sell 4,000 Insights in the United States this
year, and it is hard to believe those won't be scooped up. There
are at least that many potential buyers out there who get upset
every time this column praises the performance of one of those

&HT;     THE CATCH-22 OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ My dictionary defines a ``Catch-22'' situation as
one in which ``the only solution is denied by a circumstance
inherent in the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Heller, who invented the phrase in his 1961 novel of that
name, died on Sunday. But as we saw in the next night's debate in
Des Moines, Iowa, involving the Republican presidential candidates,
the spirit of his anti-hero, the World War II bombardier Yossarian,
lives on.
</P>
<P>
   Yossarian was the guy who discovered a provision in the military
rule book that said you can be excused from flying death-defying
missions if you are declared insane. The catch is that you have to
ask not to fly. If you ask not to fly, you show ``rational fear in
the face of clear and present danger,'' evidence that you are sane.
</P>
<P>
   Catch-22 also governs campaigns for president. If you have a
chance of getting elected, you don't say anything interesting, much
less risky, in a televised presidential debate. If you don't have a
prayer, you have all kinds of interesting, risky things to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you commit tonight to having a pro-life running mate?''
Gary Bauer demanded of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's incredibly presumptive,'' Bush answered, ``for
someone who's yet to earn his party's nomination to be picking vice
presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Catch-22! Long-shot Bauer is eager to lock himself into hard
opposition to abortion rights. Bush, son of the former president
son and the best shot to oppose Al Gore or Bill Bradley next fall,
could not be less eager.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain also proved the Catch-22 rule. Not
actively campaigning in the Iowa caucuses set for late January, he
came out against ethanol, the auto fuel produced from Iowa
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell you the things you don't want to hear as well
as the things you want to hear,'' he bluntly intoned.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who leads the polls in Iowa, was quick to demur. ``I
support ethanol and I support ethanol strongly, John, and I'd
support ethanol whether I was in Iowa or not.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Bush, McCain and possibly Steve Forbes, the trio
of hopefuls who hit the pillow each night with visions of the
Philadelphia convention and beyond, keep their impulses under
strict control during the debates. Predictably, we get the most
interesting debate performances from Gary Bauer, Utah Sen. Orrin
Hatch and Alan Keyes _ candidates with the least chance of winning,
guys enjoying their moment.

BEST WINTER DRIVING EQUIPMENT IS COMMON SENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winter driving should be a carefully thought out, cautiously
executed, top-to-bottom exercise.
</P>
<P>
   That's top to bottom as in, first, use your head, understand
that the mistakes you make driving in summer are mistakes you won't
get away with in winter; and, second, put the right tires on your
car.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, far too many folks will neglect the first, the
second, or both. When that happens, and you get into trouble _
can't stop quickly when you have to, or go into a skid on a
slippery turn _ you have to know how to get out of the mess you've
put yourself in.
</P>
<P>
   The head part involves common sense, says Tim O'Neil of the Team
O'Neil Rally School in Franconia, N.H. O'Neil, winner of multiple
rally championships in the United States and Canada, did most of
his racing on gravel, snow, and ice courses, so he knows something
about dancing on the edge of control.
</P>
<P>
   His first advice: Don't get to that edge. That means paying
attention to road conditions, knowing you can't stop or turn the
way you can on the good-gripping roads of summer. Watch the outside
temperature reading gauge that is offered in so many cars now. When
it drops from a warm day to 32 degrees and below, slow down.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to tires, snow tires on all four wheels is best,
especially if you're on the road a lot or your weekends take you
north for winter recreation. Snow tires are soft, so the rubber
moves around. They are ``stiped'' _ covered with thousands of tiny
sliced grooves that open to form thousands of little edges that
help them grip. And their treads are designed to ``work'' the snow
by packing it into strong Vs that give the tires bite.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled by mud-snow tires. Tires that do well in mud do
not do well in snow. Their clunky treads are made to spit out mud,
not work snow. Picture snow tires as boat shoes with all their tiny
slits giving grip on slippery surfaces. Picture mud tires like
clunky-treaded hiking boots.
</P>
<P>
   If you want all-weather tires, O'Neil advises, get soft ones _
sometimes the cheaper tires. Don't go for high-mileage all-weathers
because they are built harder to last longer. When it's slippery,
harder is bad. Check tires with your thumb. See if you can get the
rubber to move. These are best for winter.
</P>
<P>
   Now think about what kind of car you drive: all-wheel drive,
rear-wheel drive, front-wheel drive, four-wheel drive. For the most
part, says O'Neil, consider them all the same.
</P>
<P>
   At their base, he says, cars with all four wheels driving are
``incredibly helpful'' and driven properly, he says, ``are much
safer.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, their performance breeds overconfidence and
people think they can drive them faster. But many of these vehicles
are heavier (SUVs, pickup trucks, vans), less stable in turns, and
harder to stop in an emergency. And when they do get into skids, it
is nearly impossible to drive out of that skid as you might do with
a front-wheel- or rear-wheel-drive vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   So know they perform better, but drive them as carefully as you
would any other auto.
</P>
<P>
   But since we won't all ``be careful out there,'' as the Sarge
used to say on ``Hill Street Blues,'' here's what to do when the
two most likely emergency situations _ emergency stop, loss of
control in a slippery turn _ happen to you.
</P>
<P>
   --You're driving down a straightaway, are distracted a moment,
and see a car stalled ahead of you when you look back at the road.
Get ready to let go of your instincts.
</P>
<P>
   If your vehicle does not have ABS, use the pumping technique.
Touch your brakes until you feel the wheels are about to lock up,
release, pump again _ hopefully with a bit lighter touch on the
pedal. Release, and continue this diminishing pressure of pumping
until you either have to, or now safely can, attempt to steer
around the object ahead of you.
</P>
<P>
   When you're steering, don't hold the brakes on. This is where
you are going against instinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to release when your brain says, `I want to stop,'
'' says O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   If you do have ABS, slam the brakes on hard. The ABS system will
do the pumping for you. With the brakes on, steer around the
danger.
</P>
<P>
   --This time, you're in a corner, wheels turned, when you realize
the car is not going where you want it to. Instinct tells you to
let off on the gas or maybe hit the brakes. Either action transfers
weight from the rear to the front of your vehicle. Now you are
skidding. One of two things is likely happening.
</P>
<P>
   Say you are making a left-hand turn. Your rear end glides out
toward the right and is trying to pass your front (oversteer).
</P>
<P>
   Turn your wheels smoothly back to the right. Let off the brakes
_ and against instinct again, you may want to give it a bit of gas.
Gain control by turning into the turn. In bad skids, you may find
yourself going back and forth, right-left-right to fully halt the
alternating skids. But it works. Try it in a slippery abandoned
parking lot sometime.
</P>
<P>
   Now say you are making that left-hand turn but the nose keeps
going to the right (understeer). Don't think that by turning the
wheels more to the left that the car will suddenly catch on and go
that way. What you must do is let off the gas and turn to the right
until the car begins to go where you point it. You'll know this is
happening because you will feel the front wheels begin to grip
again. Now you can gently steer the car back to your intended line
_ or at least away from looming trouble.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil says understeer is more common in front-wheel-drive cars
while oversteer is more common in rear-wheel drive. All-wheel drive
has what he calls ``flat spin,'' in which the car will most likely
go immediately off the road. It's rare, but if you're not careful,
it can happen.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil describes his technique of teaching winter driving as
showing people ``how to avoid getting in the goo and what to do
when you are in the goo.''
</P>
<P>
   American drivers, he says, need to develop a better feel for
their cars and the skills needed in driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people die because they don't have the ability to get
out of a skid,'' he says. ``We should approach driving the way
pilots approach flying.''
</P>
<P>
   But the best advice _ though it will go unheeded by far too many
_ is this: Folks, be careful out there.

PRIVACY AT A PREMIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If you're reading this on The Boston Globe's Web site, you
know what I look like. More's the pity.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that I resemble an African-American version of
Mr. Potato Head. But I'm even more distressed by the idea that one
of you might recognize me as I flip through a copy of the National
Enquirer in the supermarket checkout line.
</P>
<P>
   I like anonymity, but I've lost it. Come to think of it, so have
the people reading this on line, and just about every other
Internet user. Once you log on, you leave an electronic trail that
can be followed right back to your home or office.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet does a great job of providing an illusion of
anonymity. You can always use zany made-up names in your e-mails,
or when signing up at a Web site. But your Internet service
provider will know your real name. Even if you don't provide your
real name to a Web site, that site does know your IP address, the
set of digits that identifies the Internet service you're using.
And that service provider can use the IP number to track you down.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are cookies, the little chunks of data that let
companies follow you as you browse the Web. Cookies used to be
harmless, because they contained no data to identify the user. But
as I reported a few months ago, some companies now have ways of
linking cookie data to your name and address. Web marketers will
know where you live.
</P>
<P>
   The only possible cure is a system that lets you travel the Net
incognito, concealing your true identity at every point along the
way. The best-known technique for this is called an anonymous
remailer. This is an Internet e-mail server that collects incoming
mail, gives it a phony e-mail address and IP number, then sends it
to its final destination.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of such remailers on the Net, run as labors
of love by devotees of on-line privacy. But I've come across some
companies that hope to turn the hunger for privacy into a
profitable business.
</P>
<P>
   There's Proxymate, a Murray Hill, N.J., firm that's being
financed by Lucent Technologies Inc. and uses technology developed
at Lucent's Bell Labs division. The company is running a free test
of its service at www.proxymate.com. Proxymate lets the user route
all Internet activity through a server that conceals the origin of
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Say you type in the Web address for Yahoo. Instead of going
straight to the Yahoo server, your request goes to Proxymate, which
in turn contacts Yahoo. This way, Yahoo never sees your browser or
your IP address.
</P>
<P>
   When a Web site asks for your e-mail address, Proxymate can
generate a fake address that will let the site send you mail but
won't give away your true identity. You can get a different e-mail
alias for each Web site. If an alias is used to send you spam, you
simply cancel that alias; the others will still work.
</P>
<P>
   The system relies on software stored on Proxymate's own server,
so you don't need new software at your end. But it does have a weak
point _ the company needs to know your real e-mail address, so your
anonymity isn't absolute. This isn't good enough for the hackers at
Montreal-based Zero-Knowledge Systems Inc. (www.zeroknowledge.com).
</P>
<P>
   Zero-Knowledge president Austin Hill believes that even the
designers of a security system shouldn't be able to defeat that
system. So his company has come up with software called Freedom
that resides on the user's computer and encrypts all information
about the user so that nobody can retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   Lose your Freedom password, and you're locked out forever.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom system routes your Internet traffic through a
network of servers scattered around the world. You can set it up to
bounce your data around so wildly that nobody will ever trace it
back to you. Freedom offers alias e-mail, as well, but with a twist
_ it's encrypted to make it even more secure.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom isn't free. You'll pay $10 a year for each alias, and
there's a minimum price of $50. You can buy one alias for five
years, or buy multiple aliases _ one for shopping, one for casual
surfing, another for posting bulletin-board messages, another for
your on-line gambling addiction. And of course, one for weekly
visits to www.nationalenquirer.com.

PALM PILOT'S MARRIAGE TO CELLULAR PHONE A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, I started hearing rumors about the pdQ. A
friend who worked in Silicon Valley told me that Qualcomm had
licensed the Palm Pilot's operating system and planned to build it
into a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody was tremendously excited: combining a Pilot and a
wireless phone into a single device seemed like a no-brainer.
Pilots hold phone numbers, cell phones dial them. Could there be a
more natural technological marriage?
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this year, I started getting the feeling that the
project was in trouble. Qualcomm promised me that the phones would
be available in the summer of 1999, and then slipped shipments to
the fall. A friend at Wired magazine told me that he had seen the
phone and it was too big. Even my contact at Sprint played down the
phone, despite the fact that the company planned to sell them for
nearly $800. Nevertheless, Sprint agreed to let me borrow a phone
for a month.
</P>
<P>
   The results are surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The pdQ phone certainly does deliver on the promise of
integrating the Palm Pilot and a Qualcomm CDMA phone. On the
outside, the pdQ looks like a somewhat oversized cellular phone,
complete with a stubby antenna and a standard keypad on its
outside. But flip the keypad open, and the phone reveals the
familiar screen of a 3Com Palm Pilot. Next to the ``+/-'' buttons
that control the phone's volume is a little holster where you can
slide the stylus used to enter commands and letters with the same
shorthand, or ``graffiti'' alphabet used by the Palm Pilot. On the
top of the phone is a little plug for a headset and a big button
that controls the Palm's backlight.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to make a phone call with the pdQ: you can
either enter the phone number on the keypad and press the TALK
button, or you can look up a phone number on the Pilot and click a
new button on the Palm's screen: DIAL. You can also dial a few
digits from the phone number on the keypad, click the menu button
labeled name, and have the phone search through the Pilot's address
book for a match. The battery is rated at 2.5 hours talk time, 40
hours standby.
</P>
<P>
   When you're not placing phone calls, you've got the full power
of a Palm Pilot, which includes an address book, calendar, and
expense report. You can beam business cards to other Palm Pilots.
You also can download more than 1,000 Pilot applications from the
Internet and run them on this phone, something that no other
cellular telephone allows.
</P>
<P>
   The phone has a built-in wireless modem for Internet access. And
it comes with two wireless data applications: one for sending
e-mail, the other for viewing the Web. Unlike the Wireless Web
phones that I reviewed a few weeks ago, the pdQ has a real Web
browser that can display HTML text from practically any site on the
Internet. I was recently in a meeting and needed somebody's phone
number: I simply jumped onto the Internet, found the home page,
copied the phone number, pasted the phone number into my address
book, and then told the phone to dial. If I had wanted to, I could
have ordered a book from Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The pdQ comes with a cradle that doubles as both the charging
stand and as the dock for synchronizing the phone with your
computer. Unfortunately, the stand is rather large _ so large that
it makes traveling with this phone something of a pain. It also
comes with a headset and three extra styluses, as well as the Palm
software that runs on a desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Early criticism of the phone's size is largely unwarranted.
Although the pdQ phone is larger than today's sleek-and-slim cell
phones, it's not noticeably larger than the cell phones that were
popular just a few years ago. It easily fits into my coat pocket,
for example. It weighs a little less than 10 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, the pdQ does have a number of problems, the biggest
being its screen. Although most cell phone screens are extremely
readable under a variety of lighting conditions, the pdQ's screen
is muddy and fairly low contrast, like most Palm Pilots. The
surface of the screen easily smudges and picks up oil and moisture
when you speak on it. The Pilot's screen simply wasn't designed for
use on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Another annoyance is the bassoon-like beep that the unit makes
whenever you touch the phone's keypad. It sounds like a cell phone
out of the 1980s! As near as I can tell, there is no way to mute
the tone or change the sound to touch-tones. Dialing the phone is
an annoying and somewhat embarrassing experience. The phone's
ringer is another letdown: there are only 13 boring rings from
which to chose, and they aren't very loud. Unlike my TouchPoint
phone, you can't assign different rings to different callers _ a
feature that is incredibly useful.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it's somewhat unnatural to control a cell phone with a
pen. Although you can use the phone's two menu buttons and volume
controls to scroll through your address list, this takes a long
time when you have a few hundred phone numbers programmed into the
thing.
</P>
<P>
   I hope that the pdQ phone sells well, because this phone is
certainly a step in the right direction. It's silly to carry both a
personal information manager and a cell phone, when both are
basically computers that store phone numbers and help you
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   It's also reprehensible that cell phone companies don't give
away developer's kits to let hobbyists and entrepreneurs write
programs for today's generation of cell phones. The pdQ skirts this
problem, by letting people download and run standard Palm programs.
</P>
<P>
   But this phone is definitely for gadget pioneers, not the rest
of us. Qualcomm and Palm need to figure out how to smooth the
integration between the two devices, both in terms of hardware and
software.

POLICE RULING FURTHER ERODES RACE POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It started 21 years ago with the Bakke case, a 1978
Supreme Court decision that startled universities nationwide by
ruling that a white student, Allan Bakke, was improperly denied a
spot in a California medical school set aside for a black
applicant.
</P>
<P>
   Bakke was the first in a line of court cases that struck down
minority preferences in hiring, firing, school admissions, and
government contracting, leading to a gradual erosion of
affirmative-action programs around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Boston remained a proud holdout. It boldly
practiced policies that promoted blacks into the previously
all-white upper ranks of the Police Department, skipping over
higher-scoring whites in the process, and set aside seats for
minorities at the city's prestigious Boston Latin School.
</P>
<P>
   So when a Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday that the Boston
Police Department was wrong to rely on race, rather than test
scores, in promoting officers, the initial assumption was that the
decision would be quickly appealed. It was not.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Police Commissioner Paul Evans, while insisting he
wants a racially diverse command staff, said he would abide by the
ruling and immediately promote about two dozen white officers who
were passed over for promotion in 1996 in favor of lower-scoring
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels this year of a decision by the Boston School
Commmittee not to appeal a federal appeals court ruling striking
down its race-sensitive admissions plans for the city's exam
schools, affirmative-action programs are under siege here, as
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that from the Supreme Court on down, the
trend has clearly been to erode affirmative action as an acceptable
policy,'' said Christopher Muse, a lawyer for the Boston Police
Detectives' Benevolent Society, the union which challenged the
department's promotion policy.
</P>
<P>
   While Bakke was the opening salvo in the war against minority
preferences, the campaign against affirmative action gained
momentum during the Reagan era, as conservative federal courts
chipped away at programs granting minority preferences and
set-asides.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a federal appeals court ordered the University of Texas
to stop giving preference to minority law school applicants. In the
same year, California's Proposition 209 banned racial preferences
statewide. Washington state's Initiative 200 did the same last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Using that legal backdrop to their advantage, such local lawyers
as Chester Darling and Michael McLaughlin successfuly challenged
raced-based policies in the Boston public schools.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the nation's courts have ruled that affirmative
action programs may exist, but that they must be narrowly tailored
to address specific instances of past discrimination and must not
establish rigid quotas. Such rulings have resulted in a weakening
of affirmative action programs that Northeastern Law School Dean
Roger I. Abrams calls ``a very sorrowful trend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing tactics used by the civil rights movement, like
litigation and threats of litigation, as a way to turn back the
clock based on the assertion that everything is fine now,'' Abrams
said. ``But of course everything isn't fine now.''
</P>
<P>
   But for opponents of affirmative action, the legal climate that
underpinned Tuesday's ruling was long in coming _ and welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a general feeling both in greater society and within
the courts that we've drifted too far away from the original
principles of the civil rights movement,'' which promised equal
protection, not preferences, said Kevin Nguyen of the American
Civil Rights Institute, a Sacramento research and education
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get back on track toward a colorblind society and
not continue seeing people through a color-coded lens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Jonathan Albano, an attorney for the Massachusetts
Minority Law Enforcement Organization, caution against the
conclusion that all affirmative action programs are doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It overstates where the law has gone to say that affirmative
action is now unlawful,'' Albano said. ``To make that blanket
statement, in my opinion, overstates what the Supreme Court has
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, faced with legal precedents tilting away from
broadly-tailored affirmative-action programs, supporters often are
reluctant to appeal to a higher court, for fear of risking a ruling
that could affect cases nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you appeal and you lose, you're going to be stuck with what
is a firm, universal precedent,'' Muse said. ``So sometimes you
have to be very careful.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; JAFFREY, N.H. _ Sitting by the wood-pellet stove that warms
much of the 200-year-old farmhouse once owned by his grandparents,
David Coll hesitates when his wife, Kelly, says she awaits
Christmas feeling blessed. A moment later, he agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Look around the newly renovated house, and the reasons for both
assertion and pause are clear.
</P>
<P>
   David Coll, 31, is in a wheelchair, his mobility the casualty of
an errant crosswind and a falling maple in a logging accident deep
in the New Hampshire woods last June. That he is alive after
breaking his back, puncturing both lungs, and having his vital
signs yo-yo from the shock of it all is one blessing. That his
family and friends volunteered evenings and weekends to make his
home wheelchair-accessible while he was far away in a
rehabilitation hospital in Colorado is another.
</P>
<P>
   From the edge of his new porch, Coll can see Peter Sawyer's
silos. Bad luck also visited Sawyer this year. A fire in August
claimed the barn at his dairy farm and killed 120 cows. Good will
knocked last month when Sawyer's neighbors and friends rebuilt his
barn, as they did when a silo fell on it in 1983. That's why the
new silo bears a ``Thank you'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   Between Coll's place and Sawyer's is the raised ranch where
Robin Mazejka lives with her two children. On June 14, a Chevrolet
crossed the center line of the Milford bypass on Route 101 and hit
Mazejka's Toyota head-on at 55 miles per hour. The driver of that
car, Melinda Aldrich, was killed. Mazejka and her children were
seriously injured. When doctors said the children would come home
in wheelchairs and her daughter, Tina, might not walk again,
Mazejka's friends made her home accessible, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unbelievable town. When we were in Colorado, people
said my neighbor wouldn't do this,'' says Kelly Coll, who is 32.
``In the midst of a hard struggle we've been really blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   In a season when the big question seems to be whether to park
'n' shop for presents or click 'n' shop, what happened in Jaffrey
in 1999 reminds us of the true spirit of giving and of receiving.
These are the greater gifts, the lasting gifts that soothe and
bind.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the generosity witnessed here is a small-town thing. As
contractor Norman Shepard, volunteer foreman at the Colls' house,
sees it, ``When you can wave to almost anybody, it's going to be
like that.'' Or maybe, as town economic development officer Peter
Davis suggests, ``It's just human nature to want to help your
neighbor when they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, there are isolated people in a small town, people whose
misfortune would not propel an outpouring of precious time. Surely,
there are people in the most crowded big-city neighborhoods who
contribute casseroles and baby-sitting and scrub brushes in times
of hardship. Surely, in Worcester, 30 times the population of
Jaffrey, there are people giving from their hearts to six families
whose husbands, sons, and fathers sacrificed their lives on the
whiff of a chance that they could save someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffrey, indeed, is so small (population 5,400) that people pass
along telephone numbers in four digits and so rural that Kelly Coll
can't tell a visitor how to get here from Boston. It's home to
Mount Monadnock and the sprawling green plant of D.D. Bean &AMP; Sons
Co., the matchbook maker that is one of the town's largest
employers, with 170 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown is a stretch of yellow brick buildings with shops like
Good N' Baked and the Thrifty Bean. A Rite Aid is going up across
the street and McDonald's is down the road. The Jaffrey Women's
Club offers scholarships and maintains a historic meeting hall. A
task force wants to open a drop-in center for the teenagers who
hang in front of the library. The ambulance squad is volunteer, and
firefighters get paid by the call.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer's farm, which has been in his family for five
generations, was the last dairy farm in a town that once had 15.
Coll's father, Archie, who supplies organic eggs to natural-food
stores, is the second generation of Colls to run a farm here. So
when David Coll and Peter Sawyer suffered this year, the people who
helped were mending the very fabric of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never left Jaffrey,'' says David Coll. ``Never wanted to. I
never had that feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robin Mazejka, on the other hand, is a relative newcomer, a city
lover who moved from Shrewsbury, Mass., in 1986. She was so upset
about her husband's career bringing them to such a small,
out-of-the-way place that she continued working in Worcester for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Mazejka, now divorced, consider Jaffrey home is the
connection nurtured through volunteer work she undertook only
because her former job as local bank branch manager required it.
She laughs at the memory, because these days she's active in the
Chamber of Commerce, sits on the planning board, and coordinates
volunteers for the annual Atlas Fireworks show. The hand she
learned to extend is now extended back to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to my first planning board meeting after the
accident, they stood up and clapped for me,'' says Mazejka, 41.
``How can you not want to live in a town like this?''
</P>
<P>
   The list of what people did to help these families is long.
</P>
<P>
   Coll's parents bought most of the materials to redo his house,
while family and friends provided free labor. They regraded the
driveway and repaved it to make it less steep and less bumpy. They
added a porch, a ramp, and an interior foyer. They knocked down
walls, widened doorways, and renovated the kitchen and bathroom.
When the work was done and the house a mess, 20 women scrubbed it
clean by the time David and Kelly and their two children returned
from Colorado. When rain left Coll soaked before he could hoist
himself from wheelchair to truck, a crew built a garage for him.
The other day an electrician, more a friend of Coll's brother than
of Coll, wired the garage. Then there's the $30,000 raised to help
defray the family's expenses.
</P>
<P>
   For Mazejka, contractor William Harper juggled a hectic summer
workload so he could get the house ready for the family's
homecoming. That meant adding a wheelchair ramp out back,
converting the rear porch to a room, and redoing the bathroom, all
for about half what he normally charges. When Mazejka was
unconscious for two weeks and couldn't see her injured son and
daughter, restaurateur Michael Barlick, 34, and businessman Steven
Walker, 32, were at the hospital almost daily visiting the
children.
</P>
<P>
   At Sawyer's farm, help came in the form of a barn-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, it's pulled the town together,'' says Women's
Club president Joanne Buck, 63. ``So many people came out of the
woodwork. The people that have been involved in these things, you
don't see them in the town office, out front on committees, and
getting their names in the paper. They're the silent people that
just do things when they need to do them.''
</P>
<P>
   They're Jaffrey natives and newcomers, cousins and friends and
friends of friends, people who bought cordwood from Coll or shopped
at his parents' farm stand or found comfort in the lone remaining
dairy farm.
</P>
<P>
   Norm and Beth Shepard helped because David Coll and Beth are
cousins, even though they weren't very close. ``I can't explain why
we were so hellbent on doing this. Maybe it was divine
intervention. We needed to give and they needed to receive,'' says
Beth Shepard, 38, who manages Coll's Garden Center. ``I miss the
closeness of working so hard. It was unbelievable what it did for
your heart and your soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Visentin, 45, a service technician for a cable television
company who's lived in town only two years, was at Coll's house
many evenings and weekends because his neighbor, Norm Shepard, was
there and he likes Shepard. ``When somebody has misfortune,''
Visentin says, ``you thank God it didn't happen to you and look for
a way to help.''

 JAFFREY, N.H.: ... to help.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The people who pitched in are busy people for whom time is hard
to come by, just as it is for any harried city dweller. Coll's
brother Mark, 39, and his wife, Lori, 35, are building a sugaring
business in addition to working the family farm.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Shepard, 41, not only works weekends at his contracting
business but he and his wife also cut their own wood and slaughter
their own meat. Walker was building a new plant for his company,
New England Wood Pellet, Inc., when he redid Mazejka's driveway and
visited the hospital. ``It was a little bit of a wild time,'' he
says. ``It was just necessary. What are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The people who received the help are busy people, too,
self-reliant New Englanders averse to asking for help and reluctant
to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want people to put themselves out again for me,''
says Sawyer, 61, who cut down the trees used to rebuild his barn.
``People kept saying we're having fun doing this. That made it
easier for an old Yankee to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Learning to take the help has been a big learning lesson,''
says Kelly Coll, office manager for her parents' trucking business.
``Not running myself ragged trying to do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   You could probably ask and ask but never know if the generosity
seen here could only happen in a small town. But the interlocking
strands of Jaffrey's rough year are purely small town. Where else
would Norm Shepard see Sawyer's barn burning and spend the day
helping clear debris, then work on Coll's house at night? Where
else would Bruce Coll, 35, haul fill for Mazejka's yard and donate
trucks to carry rubble from Sawyer's farm and pitch in at his
cousin's house? Where else would David Coll, who years ago shoveled
silage when Sawyer's silo fell, stop by the farm the day of the
barn-raising and know, from the volunteers' faces, ``that it's as
good for them as for the people receiving?''
</P>
<P>
   Life is settling down now for those in Jaffrey who gave and for
those who received. Sawyer is limiting his farming to crops and
won't rebuild his dairy operation. Instead of working 70 hours a
week, David Coll spends a few hours a day at an outdoor wood
processor adapted for him and manages his logging business from
home, with help, sometimes, from the inspirational sayings
(``Choose to be happy,'' ``You can if you think you can'') on old
calendar pages his wife has tacked to his office wall. When he runs
into people in town, he's apt to take time to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel more connected,'' he says. ``People downtown, if they
have something to say, you'll spend the extra minute. Before, I had
to get going, trying to get as much done as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazejka is back at work part time as manager of commercial
lending at Fleet Bank in Keene, and both her children _ Zachary,
12, and Tina, 16 _ are walking unaided. She carries a poem her son
wrote with the line ``I feel filled with friends,'' and she is
making plans to give her wheelchair ramp to a relative of David
Coll's so one more house will be accessible to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have to drive by the mountains and the beach to say
this is why we live in New Hampshire,'' she says. ``I don't do that
any more. I just look at the people who live here.''
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Beth Shepard ran into Helen Coll, David's mother.
I miss those hugs we had every day, the niece told the aunt, and
the aunt, 61, said she did, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had giving fill me up as much as this did,'' says
Shepard. ``I was so full of love. It brought me a lot closer to the
Lord. It was a gift to be able to give in a way that was needed so
badly. Maybe that's what it is. I never was needed so badly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas,'' says Helen Coll, ``does bring thoughts of how
much we have received from other people and how can we give back.
It makes me think about the less fortunate who don't have money or
family or friends to fall back on. What happens to those people?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend I'll call Karen recently told me that she's been crying
a lot. I've known Karen my whole life and believe me, this is a
good thing. Karen's the nicest person you could ever hope to meet,
slow to anger, not bothered by the little things that usually upset
other people, but her demeanor is flat and controlled, as if she's
locked her deepest emotions in a box and buried them.
</P>
<P>
   Since she started therapy at the ripe old age of 51, her tears
have been brimming over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to work at learning to cry again,'' she confided.
``When I started therapy, the only way I could cry was to create a
group of imaginary friends in my head. It was like weeping at a
movie. I started crying about things I imagined happening to them,
but then I started letting myself cry about my own hurts, like a
friend forgetting my birthday. I even burst into tears in a
restaurant because my husband of 20 years wasn't holding my hand. I
knew it was foolish, but it's so hard for me to show neediness, so
hard to cry while I'm confused about what I feel, that I decided
not to hold back my emotions, whether they seemed justified or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this would upset people, but surprisingly it didn't.
I made clear to everyone that `something was taking its course'
inside me, and people accepted that. I thought my sadness would be
a burden to others, but my husband especially saw it as an
opportunity to grow emotionally himself. I've always taken care of
other people's needs. Now I'm working to let the people who love me
take care of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``And something is taking its course,'' she explained. ``The
more I let my body do the crying _ weeping out loud instead of
holding back, letting the tears flow instead of just trickle down
my cheeks _ the more I've come to accept the validity of my pain.
I'm not a hypersensitive woman overreacting to trivial slights. It
isn't even the adult I am now who's crying as if her heart would
break. I'm expressing the grief I felt as a child, shedding
9-year-old tears about afternoons home alone and childhood
betrayals I never mourned. That grief intensified every year I kept
it pent up inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny. I know it sounds like I should be miserable, but
crying my heart out is much less painful than scrunching the tears
down into the pit of my stomach. Strange as it sounds, the more I
cry, the less it hurts. It's like I've spent my life struggling
over a piano lesson, memorizing the music, and painfully banging
out the notes. Now I've just given myself over to the spirit of the
piece, and it's flowing out so effortlessly and so copiously that
I'm hardly aware of feeling pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen's words made perfect sense to me. I could remember a
period about 20 years ago when I'd been deep in therapy myself. I'd
followed the sun around our living room like a cat, finding a
comfortable spot to drink wine and listen to folk singer Don McLean
sing about a friend's suicide on the stereo while tears streamed
out of my eyes, day after day. I'd ignored my own lifelong sadness
for years myself, afraid it would overwhelm me, only to discover
what a great relief it was to finally let it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was satisfied just to be able to express my feelings,''
Karen said with a note of pride in her voice. ``You can't imagine
how much better it is to feel sad than to feel nothing. But now a
new feeling has come back. In between the cries, I'm happy, and
that resonates with the past, too. I'm childishly happy, like a
little girl skipping down a sidewalk. I haven't felt this buoyant
since I was 9 years old. I'm working on expressing that part of me,
too. Last night I burst into song at the kitchen table.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it make sense to reenter the closet where painful memories
are stored and reclaim the unbearable feelings that accompanied
them? This is what Karen has discovered to be true: The adult she
has become can bear feelings that were overwhelming to her as a
child.
</P>
<P>
   When you think of gifts of the spirit, what could be more
generous than to no longer hold innocent people and unintended
slights responsible for pain whose source extends far into the
past? In this season of joy to the world, what casts a brighter
light than your own spontaneous happiness set free from years of
emotional anesthesia?
</P>
<P>
   This is what drives many of us to confront the past: the hope
that courageously facing the truth will enable us at last to
experience great pain and great pleasure with awareness,
acceptance, intensity, and gratitude.

   Christmas gift books are the best read of the year because they
help gardeners get through the excruciating indoor months of
winter. All the obvious garden books have already been written, so
this has been a year for bold sorts that expand the genre with
fierce rage and gentle whimsy. There are also books that take
readers back in time to ancient China or the American Revolution,
as the new field of garden history continues to blossom. And, as
always, there are paeans to plants, plants, and more plants.

   ``My Garden (Book),'' by Jamaica Kincaid (Farrar, Straus and
Giroux, $23). Kincaid's collection of essays is self-indulgent and
doesn't tell you much about plants, but instead dives into the
feelings gardening evokes in Kincaid (and many of the rest of us),
especially the obsession, envy, and discontent that mark this as a
passion, not a hobby. Kincaid's fierce writing style, powered by
incantational rhythms and repetitions, challenges the conventions
of garden literature the way gospel rocked the Protestant hymnal.
With undercurrents of rage and revolt, Kincaid, a descendant of
Antiguan slaves, lobs hand grenades at a genre long modeled on the
wit and understatement of ruling-class snobbery. Of one trip to a
famous English garden, Kincaid writes: ``when I saw Gravetye, it
was an Eden I loved so much, one from which I could not wait to
escape. Gravetye is now an ideal luxurious inn; I had a delicious
lunch in the dining room, and while eating I was struck with the
desire to behead all of my fellow diners.'' Kincaid's a major
writer, and her appearance in the garden book section adds an
astonishing voice to the genre.

   ``Garden Whimsy,'' by Tovah Martin and Richard W. Brown
(Houghton Mifflin/Francis Tennenbaum, $30). Most garden art that
reaches for humor is really so dumb and ugly that it scares
gardeners into playing it straight. So when the team that brought
us the best-selling ``Tasha Tudor's Garden'' went on the hunt for
horticultural levity, its challenge was to find garden features
that could, like actress Cameron Diaz, make us laugh while still
looking enchanting. Here whimsy is presented as the more comely and
well-heeled sister of funkiness. Sculpture groups, such as a band
of patinaed frogs playing jazz or a trio of stone figures as round
as the Pillsbury Doughboy, look like expensive commissions. Martin
does a deft job of laying out the book's simple premise (gardeners
need to lighten up) and then holding it all together with
mischievous anecdotes and essays. A few of the photos lack punch,
but sometimes Brown just nails it, as with the shot of
choreographer Moses Pendleton's creepy crone scarecrow commanding
obeisance from a ring of bowing sunflowers, or the cover picture of
a prom-queen scarecrow, armless and white as the Venus de Milo,
wearing an old strapless chiffon  &UR; evening &LR;  gown in flamingo pink,
seemingly the signature color of garden whimsy.

   ``Designing With Plants,'' by Piet Oudolf (Timber Press, $35).
This visionary Dutch nurseryman is a founder of the ``New Wave''
planting style for perennials that has inspired a whole school of
northern European designers. Whereas the still-dominant English
perennial border that Gertrude Jekyll pioneered almost a century
ago is based largely on color, Oudolf's revolutionary perennial
plantings dismiss color as a ``secondary consideration'' and focus
instead on the structure of plants, whether in or out of bloom. The
result is gardens of architectural foliage and seedheads, well
illustrated here, that create moods rather than images, and that
change with the seasons but maintain their fascination for most of
the year. This important book could be a revelation to serious
perennial aficionados who despair of trying to maintain constant
color in their gardens.

   ``Irish Gardens,'' by Olda FitzGerald (Hearst Books, $40). This
beautifully photographed tour of 20 Irish gardens, conducted by one
of the owners, wife of the knight of Glin, introduces the oxymoron
of the wild estate garden. These once formal landscapes started out
on the English model. But thanks to a climate that encourages more
rampant growth, access to generally more limited funds, and an
embrace of passionate disorder as a form of beauty, they evolved
into something quite different. This is a book to whet the appetite
for travel. Details are given for visiting each of the gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Art of the Kitchen Garden,'' by Jan and Michael Gertley
(Taunton Books, $30). Ornamental vegetable gardens are in vogue
these days, and for perfectionists who adore Martha Stewart, this
book offers the last word in garden craft projects. Just make sure
your giftee is an experienced vegetable gardener who grows plants
from seed and has an itch to show off. The patterns in this book
range from intricate rosettes to stars and Celtic ornaments, all
rendered in cabbages, beets, lettuces, parsley, colored Swiss
chards, and other edibles springing from the earth. Each
``potager'' can be adjusted to any size plot, but you must have a
vantage point such as a deck or terrace that will allow you and
your very impressed friends to look down on the garden. Each garden
here was photographed from a camera hoisted 40 feet above it to
reveal its symmetrical patterns, but you can hardly do that to
visitors.

   ``The New Traditional Garden: A Practical Guide to Creating and
Restoring Authentic American Gardens for Homes of All Ages,'' by
Michael Weishan (Ballantine Books, $35). They've lovingly restored
every doorknob in their old house. Now bringing the land around
their antique home back into period is only common sense _ and the
year's hottest gardening trend. Editor of the successful niche
newsletter Traditional Gardener, local author Weishan will continue
to win converts with this book. He's an opinionated pragmatist who
shares hints on how to add an appropriate old-time flavor to a yard
without being a slave to period accuracy or archival research. This
is a user-friendly and extremely enthusiastic once-over-lightly
introduction to garden history on a personal scale, full of
anecdotes and breezy sidebars.

   ``The Gardens of William Morris,'' by Jill, duchess of Hamilton,
Penny Hart, and John Simmons (Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang, $35). This
book is more about Morris, the best-known British founder of the
Arts &AMP; Crafts movement, than about his philosophy of garden design,
which was prescient but hardly a major focus in his prodigious
life. Like all the Pre-Raphaelites, he was smitten by idealized
images of the Middle Ages. Medieval gardens were the template for
his resurrection in the 1860s of the concept of formal ``garden
rooms'' outlined in woven wattle. He was also a champion of cottage
gardening with native plants. This is a pretty book for those who
love the interplay between romantic decorating and gardening,
especially when it contrasts Morris's famous wallpaper designs with
photos of the plants that inspired them.

   ``Washington's Gardens at Mount Vernon: Landscape of the Inner
Man,'' by Mac Griswold, photographed by Roger Foley (Houghton
Mifflin/Francis Tennenbaum, $40). This is a double portrait of
Mount Vernon and the man who created it. The gardens are, of
course, beautifully preserved, but more intriguing is the bold way
historian Griswold uses them and historical sources to examine the
real George Washington behind the icon, through his unguarded
devotion to his land. She shows us a landscape with flourishes
designed by a surprisingly theatrical leader, with views created to
be quickly glimpsed since the owner himself was always in motion.
During the Revolution we find a general who is cheered by planning
future garden improvements to Mount Vernon when news from the
battlefield is grim. And in the end we have met a man who never
quit until he reached his goals and who left at Mount Vernon a
completed vision. This is American garden history at its best.

   ``Garden Plants of China,'' by Peter Valder (Timber Press, $50).
Since China opened to visitors, the focus of gardeners has been the
stream of wild plants from remote areas being introduced into the
nursery trade. But this noted Australian horticulturalist runs
counter to the trend by cataloging known Chinese ornamental garden
plants, and in the process creating a reference work unique in the
English language. Most fascinating are Valder's introductory
essays, which tell us, for instance, that the Chinese traditionally
restricted ornamentals to the relative few that had acquired
symbolism through their appearance in philosophy, poetry, and art,
while more beautiful plants often went uncultivated for lack of
cultural associations. (This is one reason for the current wave of
plant explorers.) Valder gives us a window on a sophisticated
garden ethic very different from Europe's, and an encyclopedia of
more than 400 Chinese garden plants. Many will inevitably become
more widely seen here because of their natural resistance to pests
and diseases now arriving from Asia via global trade. Valder uses
English names, Latin names, and Chinese names, both in characters
and romanized.

   ``Rare Orchids,'' by Bela Kalman, text by Rodalie Davis and
Mariko Kawaguchi (Little, Brown/Bulfinch Press, $45). This hypnotic
page-turner will cast a spell over anyone susceptible to the beauty
of living things, even nongardeners. Some flowers can compare with
orchids for loveliness, but none can for diversity. The mesmerizing
thing about the 140 orchids captured in color-saturated intimacy by
Boston photographer Kalman is that they find so many different ways
to be beautiful. In addition to moth orchids that look like moths
and lady's slippers that look like slippers, there are translucent
yellow-green stars, orange macaroni, and Holy Ghost orchids that
look like tiny doves. Each plant is loaded with attitude, and no
matter how different they are, each has a fleshy mystique that
identifies it as an orchid.
</P>

   ``Treasured Perennials,'' by Graham Stuart Thomas (Sagapress,
$40). At age 90, Thomas is himself treasured as one of the most
knowledgeable and erudite garden writers in England. His legacy
includes increased popular interest in antique roses, ground
covers, and foliage plants. In this rather slight volume he picks
about 200 of his favorite perennials, ferns, and ornamental
grasses, obviously a fraction of what he's grown over a long
lifetime. Most of these plants are pretty obscure, though it's
illuminating to hear the master laud common wildflowers like false
Solomon's seal (Smilacina racemosa) and sweet rocket (Hesperis
matronalis) that we take for granted. The index gives hardiness
zones, but you're on your own for locating sources. This book will
be welcomed by plant connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perennial Combinations,'' by C. Colston Burrell (Rodale Press,
$30). The art of gardening is in composing attractive combinations
of plants. This is the year's most helpful book on the subject,
which is trickier than it sounds because plants that would
theoretically look good together can require different growing
conditions or bloom at different times. Most of Burrell's photos
are keyed so you really know which plant is which, and are
accompanied by growing tips. A Virginia garden designer, Burrell
has put together many useful categories of combinations. This book
is a safe gift for beginners because it covers the basics and will
not frustrate them with impossible visions, as will English garden
books on the same subject that feature plants lacking hardiness or
availability here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discovering Annuals,'' by Graham Rice (Timber Press, $35).
Annual flowers have long been tainted by association with gaudy
bedding schemes. Besides, most American gardeners don't like to
grow plants from seed. So perennials have gripped our attention,
while the wide world of annuals has gone largely unexamined. This
handsome, well-written book is a first-rate introduction to both
annuals and biennials (which bloom the second year from seed). It's
also discriminating enough to interest people who have been growing
them all their lives.

   ``A Guide to the Landscape Architecture of Boston,'' by Jack
Ahern (Hubbard Educational Trust, $20). This book is an unusual mix
of past, present, and future. Pocket-size but richly illustrated,
it contains locations and very brief descriptions of 193 selected
landscape projects in metropolitan Boston and the North Shore. Some
sites, such as the Olmsted-designed Moraine Farm in Beverly, are
the kind of hidden historic gems you expect in a guidebook. But
many, like the New Charles River Basin, haven't been built yet.
This is either a visionary book or one with a short shelf life,
depending on how many of these projects are realized according to
plan. Meanwhile, a flip through these pages will convince you that
there is a lot of open space on the table right now, making this
the most active era in the sculpting of Boston's landscape in 100
years. We hope it goes well.

   This year's design books cover topics from historical furniture
to Indian interiors to how to marry light and color in your rooms.
They range from the scholarly to the silly. Terence Riley's ``The
Un-Private House'' (Abrams, $29.95) may strike some people as both.
Museum of Modern Art curator Riley documents 26 houses, worldwide,
that are Brave New World: glass walls; no walls; no walls even in
the bathroom; a computer in every room. It's the most provocative
design tome this year.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Patricia Bayer's ``Art Deco Architecture: Design,
Decoration and Detail From the Twenties and Thirties'' (Thames &AMP;
Hudson, $29.95) is downright nostalgic. Here are homes with
luxury-liner lines and Mayan Revival details; urban facades adorned
with friezes of noble agricultural workers; cocktail shakers that
look like skyscrapers and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   For a dive deeper into history, consider ``A Renaissance
Treasury: The Flagg Collection of European Decorative Arts and
Sculpture'' (Hudson Hills, $50) by Laurie Winters. The collection,
which is housed at the Milwaukee Art Museum, includes such delights
as clocks in the form of a camel and a tabernacle, a door knocker
shaped like a lion, and a lock depicting St. Michael slaying the
dragon, hinting that death would likewise be the fate of an
intruder.
</P>
<P>
   For a record of a decorative arts collection of more recent
vintage, see ``The Art of Craft: Contemporary Works From the Saxe
Collection'' (Bulfinch, $50), by Timothy Anglin Burgard, an
imaginative curator who used to work at Harvard and is now at the
Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, future home of the crafts that
Dorothy and George Saxe have amassed over the past two decades.
Burgard's essay is as entertaining as it is enlightening; he
gracefully connects contemporary American artists with those of
long ago and far away. And because the Saxes don't distinguish
between high art and low, ``fine'' artists like Kiki Smith and
Christopher Wilmarth are also included in their collection and
Burgard's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   For a book where ideas, not pretty pictures, are the point,
there's Richard Hill's ``Designs and Their Consequences:
Architecture and Aesthetics'' (Yale, $30), a scholarly examination
of the relationship between theory and real buildings, concluding
with an evaluation of modernism's aim of tying form to function.
</P>
<P>
   The season's most unusual design book is Elizabeth Smith
Brownstein's ``If This House Could Talk: Historic Homes,
Extraordinary Americans'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $35), which weaves
together the stories of notable Americans and their houses, from
Abraham Lincoln to Frank Lloyd Wright. The New Englanders
represented include the predictable _ Robert Frost, John Quincy
Adams _ and the unexpected. In the latter category are Rebecca
Nurse, 17th-century victim of Salem's witchcraft hysteria, and
writer Edward Gorey, whose expanded Cape in Yarmouth Port, Mass.
Brownstein cheerfully describes as ``decaying, peeling and
dilapidated.'' Explains its owner, with equal cheer, ``Life is
basically ghastly.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very beginning of the 20th century, Gustav Stickley
started making furniture that is still prized at century's end.
Victorian fuss was on the wane when Stickley stepped in, becoming a
leader of the Arts &AMP; Crafts movement that advocated simplicity of
line and truth to materials. He built a lifestyle around those
beliefs and published books and magazines to disseminate them. In
``Stickley Style'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $40), writer David Cathers
ably chronicles his career. But it's Alexander Vertikoff's
masterful color photographs of interiors filled with rectilinear
oak furniture and jewel-toned tiles that are the book's chief lure.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that a good number of the makers featured in
``Furniture Studio: The Heart of the Functional Arts'' (the
Furniture Society, $30) hail from New England. This region is a
leader in the American studio furniture movement _ a leader even on
a global scale. (British furniture maker David Linley gets more
international press than anyone in the United States, though: It
helps to have an aunt who's the queen.) The book, intended as the
first in a series, includes essays both philosophical and
practical, gorgeous photographs of adventurous work, and chapters
on where to find it and how to commission it.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent _ and puckish _ New England furniture artist has a
book all to himself this year. In ``Two Looks to Home: The Art of
Tommy Simpson'' (Bulfinch, $50), Connecticut-based Simpson writes
about the influence that growing up in a small Midwestern town had
on his fantasy furniture, where columns and caryatids can serve as
spindles on a Windsor chair that also sprouts wings. And mittens.
And a flower and a snake.
</P>
<P>
   What New England is to one-of-a-kind handmade furniture the
Pacific Northwest is to glass. And, say what you want about him _
that he hasn't tackled the tough technical stuff himself for years,
that his workers turn out endless clones of his most popular pieces
_ Dale Chihuly is king of the field. In a newly expanded edition of
``Chihuly'' (Abrams, $75), the distinguished critic Donald Kuspit
analyzes the artist's explosive, fluid glass forms, and recent
gargantuan glass installations.
</P>
<P>
   In their sumptuous and surprising ``Indian Interiors'' (Taschen,
$39.99), writer Sunil Sethi and photographer Deidi von Schaewen go
from mud huts to maharajas' palaces. The constants are vivid, even
clashing, colors and the impulse, no matter what the rank or
resources of the homeowner, to adorn every last inch of every last
wall. A posh lakeside houseboat is one of the showstoppers, filled
with carved wooden walls and ceilings and softened by acres of
crewel embroidery. Abundant use of lacy, pierced wood keeps the
boat's rooms light and airy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Color is light made visible,'' writes Donald Kaufman, who,
with fellow color consultant Taffy Dahl, authored ``Color and
Light: Luminous Atmospheres for Painted Rooms'' (Crown, $50). The
book is the result of their travels across the country to advise
people on what hues to paint their walls, recommendations based on
the time of day the room will get the most use and the differences,
say, between the clear, warm light of Santa Fe and the gray murk of
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   People passionate about their art also tend to be picky about
its setting, whether it be a minimalist interior, where what's on
the walls is the only focus, or surroundings of baroque exuberance,
where the art has to compete. The range is explored in ``At Home
With Art: How Art Lovers Live With and Care for Their Treasures''
(Potter, $50), by Estelle Ellis, Caroline Seebohm, and Christopher
Simon Sykes. The authors allow you to play the voyeur, peeking into
the homes of major collector couples including Agnes Gund and
Daniel Shapiro, and creative types like playwright Edward Albee,
who, in the entrance of his Manhattan loft, mixes part of a
Philippine pygmy hut with a Biedermeier chest and Lipchitz
painting. Boston is represented in the book by John Axelrod, whose
Back Bay condo is filled with art from California funk ceramics to
the South American painting he champions.
</P>
<P>
   The antique Oriental carpet is a subject that mystifies many
Westerners. Enza Milanesi's ``The Carpet: Origins, Art and
History'' (Firefly, $50) offers an in-depth study of the origins of
this ever-popular form of textile that seems to harmonize with
almost any decor. Milanesi, a Rome-based art historian, explains
the making of carpets, the meanings of their symbolic designs, and
the milieus in which they were created. Best of all, the book
boasts a wealth of color photographs that show exactly what she's
talking about, as well as a list of museums in the United States
and abroad with stellar examples of carpets in their collections.
</P>
<P>
   John Morley's ``The History of Furniture'' (Bulfinch, $75) is
almost as all-encompassing as the title suggests. The former Keeper
of Furniture and Interior Design at the Victoria and Albert Museum
in London, Morley has produced an engrossing study of the
development of style, starting with King Tutankhamen's surprisingly
modern-looking ceremonial chair, a design dating from circa 1320
BC. He traces Asian and African influences on Western furniture,
and tracks enduring idioms like the Gothic, which has reappeared
periodically since its 12th-century debut. The framework for his
nimble arguments is contrasts: classical vs. romantic; order vs.
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms have always been decorated, of course. But the profession
of interior designer _ as distinct from, say, architect, fresco
painter, or ebeniste _ is largely a phenomenon of the 1900s. In
``Influential Interiors: Shaping 20th Century Style Through Key
Interior Designers'' (Potter, $45), Suzanne Trocme looks at key
figures in the field, from Elsie de Wolfe to Philippe Starck, and
examines major ``looks'' from English country house to
son-of-Art-Nouveau to the all-purpose ``eclectic.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child of the '60s, I'm not sure I want to relive them. Op
Art still gives me a hangover. Nonetheless, Cara Greenberg's ``Op
to Pop: Furniture of the 1960s'' (Bulfinch, $40) is fun. Chairs
made of molded plastic, tubular steel, or giant bean bags, shaped
like Marilyn's lips or toadstools, filling rooms with undulating
walls: These were staples of a decade when the revolutionary home
looked like either a spaceship or a cave. Greenberg discusses
experiments of the era including Bloomingdale's adventurous model
rooms, and designers from the somber Scandinavians to the impish
Frank Gehry. Turns out she's a Flower Child herself: There's a
photo of her taking a dip in the reflecting pool of the Washington
Monument during a '60s protest march. She rightly notes that few
Americans of the time actually came into contact with radical
furniture. ``Most of it was simply too avant-garde to have found
its way into American homes,'' she writes. Should you want it to
find its way into yours belatedly, she's included a handy list of
sources.

SMOOTHING STEPFAMILY GATHERINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When two adults with children from previous marriages try to
make Christmaswork under one roof, expect the worst.
</P>
<P>
   As pessimistic as that may sound, it can actually be a positive
coping skill. Professionals who work with stepfamilies say any
holiday, but especially a big one like Christmas, can be so
stressful that it's better to keep expectations low, lest hurt and
resentment build.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often what works best is not at all what you had in mind,''
says psychologist Patricia Papernow, a stepfamily researcher in
Cambridge, Mass. and author of ``Becoming a Stepfamily''
(Analytic).
</P>
<P>
   No new couple imagines separating on Christmas, for instance,
with you heading off to your parents with your child and your
spouse to hers with her children. That feels bad, as if you're
coming apart rather than together. But that just may be what you
need to do first, says Papernow.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the matter is that it's not just adults who have
memories and fantasies. ``The holidays are full of moments that
hold loss, even for young children,'' says family therapist Judy
Osborne, director of Stepfamily Associates in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, children typically can't or don't label or talk
about feelings. Their sadness comes out as resentment and anger and
translates to behaviors that make holidays messy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pent-up anxiety &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michele Rogers, for instance, who is 12 and lives in Framingham,
Mass. with her father and stepmother, is normally cheerful and
cooperative. But her mother and sister, Kim, live in Colorado, and
she's been hoping since the summer that Kim will come east for
Christmas. She doesn't talk about it, says her father, Bob Rogers,
but he can tell it's on her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's cranky and frustrated. Quick to talk back,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Whether hurts are big or small, spoken or not, children need to
get issues out in the open and know that any feelings are OK to
have, says Osborne. Rogers and his wife, Ann-Marie, try to do that
with Michele, but they walk a fine line: They want to offer empathy
but not foster false hope. Says Ann-Marie, ``I told her the other
day, `It's gonna stink for you, isn't it, if she doesn't come?' I
know that's how she feels and I want her to know we know how
important it is to her.''
</P>
<P>
   As tough as it can be, at least the Rogerses know exactly what's
bothering Michele. Many parents and stepparents field moodiness and
angry outbursts without a clue as to what's fueling them. When in
doubt, says Osborne, assume it's feelings of disloyalty. For
instance:
</P>
<P>
   --It's time to go to church and your 5-year-old son won't get
into the car with his stepsiblings. ``Maybe he's remembering the
years when it was just the two of you and he sat in front,'' says
Osborne. Translate his behavior to: ``I feel betrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   --It's your first Christmas with your 7-year-old stepdaughter
and you're cooking up a storm when she becomes mean and pouty.
Translation: ``She's trying to outdo my mom!''
</P>
<P>
   --Although you've gone to your husband's sister's family for
three years since you married, your 9-year-old suddenly is refusing
to go. Translation: ``I really like it there.'' In other words,
says Osborne, the more comfortable she feels with extended
stepfamily, the more disloyal she feels to her other parent. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cutting to the nub &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As irrational as some of these thoughts may seem, they are real
to a child. Ignoring them makes things worse, not better. Cutting
to the nub _ ``Does your mom make holiday cookies, too?'' _ may or
may not get her talking. But dealing with the surface issue _ ``It
hurts my feelings when you talk to me like that'' _ will only fuel
her resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when a child experiences disappointment, don't brush
it off. ``Acknowledge it,'' says stepfamily researcher and lecturer
Margorie Engel, president of the Stepfamily Association of America.
Better to say ``I'm sorry your dad didn't send a gift; I know that
hurts'' than to make excuses _ ``He probably didn't know what size
you are now'' _ or pretend it's not a big deal: ``Look at all the
other great gifts you got!'' Whatever you do, she says, don't
bad-mouth the other parent or family.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointments or eruptions in the middle of your celebration
are dreadful; there's nothing like a miserable child to cast a pall
over the day for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Papernow remembers her own first Christmas with her now-adult
stepdaughter, Pam, who was 9 at the time. ``We'd spent lots of time
negotiating in advance about her traditions and mine, and I thought
everything was worked out,'' she says. ``Halfway through opening
presents, she burst into tears and ran upstairs. Turns out,'' says
Papernow, ``I'm a person who likes to open one gift at a time, get
a cup of coffee, open another gift. She's a person who likes
everyone to open presents until they're all done. By my third cup,
she was over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you've expressed empathy and offered an ear, Papernow
advises, give a child permission to take some time alone, and
suggest she rejoin you after she regroups. If she returns and
continues to be miserable, it's OK to set a limit: ``This is still
Christmas for us. If you can't be pleasant, it's better for you to
stay in your room.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Typical letdowns &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most common sources of disappointment are also two of
the trickiest for parents to deal with:
</P>
<P>
   --Unequal treatment from steprelatives. It's not unusual for
grandparents to lavish gifts on their biological grandchild and
ignore their new stepgrandchild. What's worse is if they indulge a
baby who is the half sibling of the stepgrandchild. For a child who
already feels left out, inferior, and/or abandoned, this is an
awful blow, says Papernow. She urges relatives to give equally to
all children even if you don't feel equally about them, even if you
haven't met them. She also tells parents to work to eliminate
disparate treatment, including defraying costs for grandparents. If
unequal treatment occurs anyway, talk about it, even with
preschoolers: ``Grandma and Grandpa are having trouble
understanding how our new family works. We need to help them.''
Unequal treatment that continues into a second or third year is
significant enough to allow you to temporarily disassociate
yourselves from a family celebration, says Papernow.
</P>
<P>
   --Time spent with one family is time away from the other. For a
child with two families, there is sadness at having to leave one to
be with the other, no matter how much she loves those people, too,
says marriage and family therapist Taube Kaufman of Chapel Hill,
N.C. There's also a scary thought as she leaves each home _ ``What
am I missing?'' _ and another one when she returns: ``Will I still
fit in?'' The more frequently she makes the transition, the less
worry there is, but at holidays it increases for any child going to
either home. If there are issues at one house, from a new baby he
loves to a stepsibling he hates, expect transitions to be off the
scale in difficulty. Then you can be that much more pleased if they
aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman tells parents to build in half an hour to a day of
transition time, depending on familiarity. ``Don't schedule them so
tightly they have to rush off to an event 15 minutes later,'' she
says. Also don't expect them to be warm and loving or even social
when they first arrive; many kids need time to decompress by
themselves in the new space. Kaufman is author of ``The Combined
Family: A Guide to Creating Successful Step Relationships''
(Plenum). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Common concerns &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't assume, either, that the huge, overarching issue for you _
understanding how this new family works _ isn't also a big issue
for your child. It is for Nathaniel Richman, but his mother, Robin
Hanley, found out only inadvertently.
</P>
<P>
   It happened just after their first Christmas, four years ago.
Because Nathaniel and Robin are Jewish and her husband Dean and his
daughter, Felicity, also 12, are Catholic, this was Nathaniel's
first tree. The buildup was immense. But on Christmas, Felicity was
with her mom and Nathaniel was sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me, `Do you want to know my idea of a perfect
Christmas?' '' Robin says. ``He told me it would be to spend it
with everyone he loves: his dad and stepmom, Felicity and her mom,
and me and Dean.''
</P>
<P>
   For Robin, it was a poignant moment. ``He realized how
complicated the concept of family had become,'' says his mom. ``All
the people he loved couldn't be together on a holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Suggestions for stepparents &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Before a stepfamily's first holiday together, ask each child,
regardless of age, the best thing about previous celebrations. Get
specific: favorite food to favorite song. Then help them narrow the
list down to the top three or four priorities they'd like to see
included in this year's get-together. Be clear that your
celebration will be respectful of their wishes but that final
decisions belong to the adults.
</P>
<P>
   --Remember that familiar food can be critical to a child's
comfort level.
</P>
<P>
   --Rather than re-create old rituals, create new ones together.
</P>
<P>
   --A good answer when they're unhappy about something: ``This is
how we're making this new family work right now, for this holiday.
Next year, we can rethink it.''
</P>
<P>
   --Hold a review afterward: What should we do again next year?
Take copious notes, including ones about who liked what, so that
when you make changes, they aren't only the ones Nancy asked for.
Repeat this process every year; it can become a ritual in itself.
</P>
<P>
   --Before your child leaves for his other parent's, give him
permission to enjoy himself: ``I hope you will have a good time.
I'm going to, too. Afterward, we'll share our stories.''
</P>
<P>
   --Keep in mind that it can take four years for a stepfamily's
holiday celebration to feel comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   --Be flexible with teens who do not want to be part of an
extended stepfamily meal: ``Being part of this family means you
show up and you're civil. But you only have to stay an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   --Help children choose or make gifts for stepgrandparents.
</P>
<P>
   --If you're a father who has remarried, sign the card on your
child's gift even if your wife buys and wraps it. Otherwise, he
feels abandoned: ``Dad didn't even do my gift this year.''
</P>
<P>
   --If a child is spending part of a holiday with steprelatives
she doesn't know, details help her cope, including knowing the menu
and seeing photos of people ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   --Stepfamily Associates has a Web site with holiday tips:

   JERUSALEM _ It took peace talks and expectations of a million
extra visitors in 2000 for the first joint Israeli-Palestinian tour
agency to be born.
</P>
<P>
   IPP Tours formed out of the age-old motive for profit and market
maximization.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, American tourists have booked heavily with
Israeli firms, Europeans more likely to go with a Palestinian
company.
</P>
<P>
   IPP officials, who ran other travel firms on their own sides of
the cultural divide, said the recent re-opening of peace talks
between Israel and the Palestinians made the climate right to merge
talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the millennium will give us the advantage of sharing
the world market; that Israelis and Palestinians can work
together,'' said Palestinian co-founder Hana Siniora.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government projects 3.2 million tourists coming to
Israel and the Palestinian areas this year, topping the previous
high of 2.5 million in 1995. Travel executives are looking to break
down old barriers of politics and competition.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Holy Land might not be ready for the influx. The
private agencies have been cooperating more than the Israeli and
Palestinian governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is very bad,'' said Yoel Mansfeld, director of
the Center for Tourism, Pilgrimage and Recreation Research at
Israel's Haifa University. ``This is a hallmark event, one of the
biggest I have ever heard of. Planning should have started 10 or 12
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, it began about four years ago. He worries
about bottlenecks or dangerous crowding at holy sites. Already, the
narrow streets of Jerusalem's Old City are sometimes so jammed that
people are shoved against the shop walls, knocking merchandise to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Crowd control gets trickier when two governments are involved.
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks, Israeli military and police officials have been
meeting weekly with Palestinian officials to discuss security,
traffic flow, and emergency services during the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Shlomo Dror, spokesman for the Israeli
administration in Palestinian areas, said 20,000 tourists are
expected to travel the five-mile route from Jerusalem to Bethlehem
each day during 2000. They will have to pass a one-lane Israeli
army checkpoint where Palestinian cars are often searched.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are setting up a room to monitor which areas of
Bethlehem, Jericho and other popular cities are overcrowded so
buses can be diverted, if necessary. Finally, they are sharing
names of religious fanatics who may be working their way to the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Dror said the coordination should probably have started a year
ago. But tense relations between Israel and the Palestinians, at
the time made it impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the problems between us, the year 2000 is not going to
wait,'' Dror said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   For the private travel industry, the motive is money and the
cooperation has been better.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli and Palestinian tourists industries have long worked
together, despite Palestinian complaints of short shrift. Israel
controls the airports and border points into the region, so most
visitors spend their nights in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Palestinian-controlled Bethlehem allege that,
although 40 percent of the region's visitors come to their city,
they only get 5 percent of the region's tourist spending.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-guided tour buses often lead pilgrims to the Church of
the Nativity then whisk them back with no time for shopping or
eating.
</P>
<P>
   But, an overhaul of Bethlehem has created new sites and will
likely generate tourists for a longer stay.
</P>
<P>
   There, and elsewhere, huge opportunities will be created this
year because of the convergence of the millennium, a possible visit
from Pope John Paul II and peace talks _ which always improve
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear that we are together in this, Israelis,
Palestinians and even Jordanians,'' said Avi Rosenthal, director
general of the Israeli Hotel Association. ``Everybody has a vested
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal hopes the millennium will build a foundation for
``regional tourism'' that would commonly take tours through
Palestinian areas, Egypt, Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It's normal in other regions, but still under-developed here
because of regional tensions. For example, Arabs usually refuse to
come to Israel because of the political conflicts between their
countries.

   MEGIDDO, Israel _ The world might be coming to an end, but at
least you'll have a place to park.
</P>
<P>
   At the archeological site of Megiddo, known in the New Testament
as Armageddon, Israeli park authorities are adding a reserve
parking lot for the influx of visitors expected in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the hill-top dig overlooks a wide valley where,
according to the Book of Revelations, the final battle before
Judgement Day will be fought. Many believe that comes shortly after
the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Megiddo's ruin-with-a-view already hosts 250,000 people annually
and officials expect that to double next year.
</P>
<P>
   With similar projections for other biblical locations,
especially along the path of Jesus Christ, improvements are being
made throughout the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   At many sites, jack-hammers still pound away. Both Palestinian
and Israeli officials acknowledge, and are criticized for, their
late start. Many attractions and hotels and new roads will not be
ready until mid-year.
</P>
<P>
   But, once pilgrims fight through the traffic jams and long
lines, they will see enhancements at the places where biblical
beliefs meet the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Near Jericho, there are new cable cars scaling the mountain
believed to be the Mount of Temptation. In Bethlehem, there is a
massive overhaul of Manger Square. On the Sea of Galilee, Israel is
adding new boat piers. In Nazareth, there will be new roads,
tourist routes and plazas.
</P>
<P>
   Here, at Megiddo (pronounced, 'mi-GEE-doh'), a national park in
central Israel, the new parking compliments two new platforms for
prayer among the excavations. The park already had a small museum,
restaurant and souvenir shop _ with guidebooks, videos and Megiddo
ball caps.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Cathers, an evangelical pastor from near Lexington, Ky.,
visited with parishioners recently for his fourth time. He said he
believes the biblical prophecy will play out in the battle in the
valley in ``a matter of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Visits to Megiddo and other sites, he said, bring the scriptures
to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have video to go with the audio,'' Cathers said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the best video will not come until the end of the
year. Park officials plan a wide-screen show that will super-impose
images from different ages on a view of the actual ruins.
</P>
<P>
   For now, according to planning director Ze'ev Margalit, the
parks authority is making sure it can handle the crowds. Margalit
said they can handle a half-million visitors a year for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that,'' he said. ``We don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, the largest renovations are taking place at the
key site of the millennium, Christ's birthplace of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   About five miles south of Jerusalem, Bethlehem was transferred
from Israeli to Palestinian control in 1995. It had become a
chaotic city of 150,000, overcome by refugee camps, and lacking
suitable roads and sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors long chafed at the noisy bus parking lot in front of
the massive stone Church of the Nativity, which stands over the
traditional site of Christ's birth.
</P>
<P>
   In an $8.5 million project paid for with Swedish aid money, the
parking lot has been removed and replaced with a tidy stone,
tree-lined piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Near the church on Manger Square, an ugly prison left over from
British and Israeli rule was destroyed and replaced with a ``Peace
Center.'' It will offer a nativity museum, displays on the history
of Bethlehem and a tourist information center.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials have used the millennium to launch an
overall renewal of the biblical city. The rutted streets of the old
quarters near the church have new stones and sewage systems. A
Christmas Market, offering crafts and souvenirs opened this week.
</P>
<P>
   The new sites now offer a full day's activities for pilgrims,
who frequently come just to visit the church and leave.
</P>
<P>
   The city also has several new hotels, including a five-star
Inter-Continental Hotel built around a restored palace.
</P>
<P>
   The work is being done through foreign donations and loans of
$86 million and private, mostly Palestinian investment, of another
$110 million.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The second-most striking new construction in the Palestinian
territories is a new, $10 million cable car, shopping and hotel
complex in Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   A private venture, the cable cars soar at over 210 feet above
date palm orchards and an excavation site of the 8,000-year-old Tel
es-Sultan tower.
</P>
<P>
   They climb midway up the Mount of Temptation, where the Devil
tried to tempt Christ. Nearby is a Greek Orthodox monastery.
</P>
<P>
   At the cable cars' mountainside perch is a French restaurant and
small caves. At the ground level take-off point is another
restaurant, a mini-mall with 16 souvenir stores and a soon-to-open
55-room hotel.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the city of Nazareth is getting the biggest makeover,
which has been going on for about three years at a cost of $55
million. Roads and plazas are being upgraded and an illuminated
nighttime walk is being made for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   On the Sea of Galilee, a new promenade is being paved along the
seashore and piers are being added for the ancient-style wooden
boats that give pilgrims a trip on the water.
</P>
<P>
   But, the government may not be able to make one important
alteration that initially seemed easy.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Israeli officials have wanted to install
an emergency exit in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which most
Christians believe is the site of Christ's crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   But, the six denominations that control parts of the cavernous
church cannot agree on a location.
</P>
<P>
   BOX: Cable Cars, Piers and Nativity Museums on Millennium Trail
</P>
<P>
   With 3.2 million visitors expected for the year 2000, Israeli
and Palestinian officials are remaking many of the Holy Land's
sites. Here are some of the new attractions completed or coming:

   MEGIDDO, Israel _ The world might be coming to an end, but at
least you'll have a place to park.
</P>
<P>
   At the archeological site of Megiddo, known in the New Testament
as Armageddon, Israeli park authorities are adding a reserve
parking lot for the influx of visitors expected in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the hill-top dig overlooks a wide valley where,
according to the Book of Revelations, the final battle before
Judgement Day will be fought. Many believe that comes shortly after
the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Megiddo's ruin-with-a-view already hosts 250,000 people annually
and officials expect that to double next year.
</P>
<P>
   With similar projections for other biblical locations,
especially along the path of Jesus Christ, improvements are being
made throughout the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   At many sites, jack-hammers still pound away. Both Palestinian
and Israeli officials acknowledge, and are criticized for, their
late start. Many attractions and hotels and new roads will not be
ready until mid-year.
</P>
<P>
   But, once pilgrims fight through the traffic jams and long
lines, they will see enhancements at the places where biblical
beliefs meet the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Near Jericho, there are new cable cars scaling the mountain
believed to be the Mount of Temptation. In Bethlehem, there is a
massive overhaul of Manger Square. On the Sea of Galilee, Israel is
adding new boat piers. In Nazareth, there will be new roads,
tourist routes and plazas.
</P>
<P>
   Here, at Megiddo (pronounced, 'mi-GEE-doh'), a national park in
central Israel, the new parking compliments two new platforms for
prayer among the excavations. The park already had a small museum,
restaurant and souvenir shop _ with guidebooks, videos and Megiddo
ball caps.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Cathers, an evangelical pastor from near Lexington, Ky.,
visited with parishioners recently for his fourth time. He said he
believes the biblical prophecy will play out in the battle in the
valley in ``a matter of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Visits to Megiddo and other sites, he said, bring the scriptures
to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have video to go with the audio,'' Cathers said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the best video will not come until the end of the
year. Park officials plan a wide-screen show that will super-impose
images from different ages on a view of the actual ruins.
</P>
<P>
   For now, according to planning director Ze'ev Margalit, the
parks authority is making sure it can handle the crowds. Margalit
said they can handle a half-million visitors a year for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that,'' he said. ``We don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, the largest renovations are taking place at the
key site of the millennium, Christ's birthplace of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   About five miles south of Jerusalem, Bethlehem was transferred
from Israeli to Palestinian control in 1995. It had become a
chaotic city of 150,000, overcome by refugee camps, and lacking
suitable roads and sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors long chafed at the noisy bus parking lot in front of
the massive stone Church of the Nativity, which stands over the
traditional site of Christ's birth.
</P>
<P>
   In an $8.5 million project paid for with Swedish aid money, the
parking lot has been removed and replaced with a tidy stone,
tree-lined piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Near the church on Manger Square, an ugly prison left over from
British and Israeli rule was destroyed and replaced with a ``Peace
Center.'' It will offer a nativity museum, displays on the history
of Bethlehem and a tourist information center.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials have used the millennium to launch an
overall renewal of the biblical city. The rutted streets of the old
quarters near the church have new stones and sewage systems. A
Christmas Market, offering crafts and souvenirs opened this week.
</P>
<P>
   The new sites now offer a full day's activities for pilgrims,
who frequently come just to visit the church and leave.
</P>
<P>
   The city also has several new hotels, including a five-star
Inter-Continental Hotel built around a restored palace.
</P>
<P>
   The work is being done through foreign donations and loans of
$86 million and private, mostly Palestinian investment, of another
$110 million.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The second-most striking new construction in the Palestinian
territories is a new, $10 million cable car, shopping and hotel
complex in Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   A private venture, the cable cars soar at over 210 feet above
date palm orchards and an excavation site of the 8,000-year-old Tel
es-Sultan tower.
</P>
<P>
   They climb midway up the Mount of Temptation, where the Devil
tried to tempt Christ. Nearby is a Greek Orthodox monastery.
</P>
<P>
   At the cable cars' mountainside perch is a French restaurant and
small caves. At the ground level take-off point is another
restaurant, a mini-mall with 16 souvenir stores and a soon-to-open
55-room hotel.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the city of Nazareth is getting the biggest makeover,
which has been going on for about three years at a cost of $55
million. Roads and plazas are being upgraded and an illuminated
nighttime walk is being made for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   On the Sea of Galilee, a new promenade is being paved along the
seashore and piers are being added for the ancient-style wooden
boats that give pilgrims a trip on the water.
</P>
<P>
   But, the government may not be able to make one important
alteration that initially seemed easy.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Israeli officials have wanted to install
an emergency exit in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which most
Christians believe is the site of Christ's crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   But, the six denominations that control parts of the cavernous
church cannot agree on a location.

<P>
   BOX: Cable Cars, Piers and Nativity Museums on Millennium Trail

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ It took peace talks and expectations of a million
extra visitors in 2000 for the first joint Israeli-Palestinian tour
agency to be born.
</P>
<P>
   IPP Tours formed out of the age-old motive for profit and market
maximization.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, American tourists have booked heavily with
Israeli firms, Europeans more likely to go with a Palestinian
company.
</P>
<P>
   IPP officials, who ran other travel firms on their own sides of
the cultural divide, said the recent re-opening of peace talks
between Israel and the Palestinians made the climate right to merge
talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the millennium will give us the advantage of sharing
the world market; that Israelis and Palestinians can work
together,'' said Palestinian co-founder Hana Siniora.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government projects 3.2 million tourists coming to
Israel and the Palestinian areas this year, topping the previous
high of 2.5 million in 1995. Travel executives are looking to break
down old barriers of politics and competition.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Holy Land might not be ready for the influx. The
private agencies have been cooperating more than the Israeli and
Palestinian governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is very bad,'' said Yoel Mansfeld, director of
the Center for Tourism, Pilgrimage and Recreation Research at
Israel's Haifa University. ``This is a hallmark event, one of the
biggest I have ever heard of. Planning should have started 10 or 12
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, it began about four years ago. He worries
about bottlenecks or dangerous crowding at holy sites. Already, the
narrow streets of Jerusalem's Old City are sometimes so jammed that
people are shoved against the shop walls, knocking merchandise to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Crowd control gets trickier when two governments are involved.
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks, Israeli military and police officials have been
meeting weekly with Palestinian officials to discuss security,
traffic flow, and emergency services during the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Shlomo Dror, spokesman for the Israeli
administration in Palestinian areas, said 20,000 tourists are
expected to travel the five-mile route from Jerusalem to Bethlehem
each day during 2000. They will have to pass a one-lane Israeli
army checkpoint where Palestinian cars are often searched.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are setting up a room to monitor which areas of
Bethlehem, Jericho and other popular cities are overcrowded so
buses can be diverted, if necessary. Finally, they are sharing
names of religious fanatics who may be working their way to the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Dror said the coordination should probably have started a year
ago. But tense relations between Israel and the Palestinians, at
the time made it impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the problems between us, the year 2000 is not going to
wait,'' Dror said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   For the private travel industry, the motive is money and the
cooperation has been better.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli and Palestinian tourists industries have long worked
together, despite Palestinian complaints of short shrift. Israel
controls the airports and border points into the region, so most
visitors spend their nights in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Palestinian-controlled Bethlehem allege that,
although 40 percent of the region's visitors come to their city,
they only get 5 percent of the region's tourist spending.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-guided tour buses often lead pilgrims to the Church of
the Nativity then whisk them back with no time for shopping or
eating.
</P>
<P>
   But, an overhaul of Bethlehem has created new sites and will
likely generate tourists for a longer stay.
</P>
<P>
   There, and elsewhere, huge opportunities will be created this
year because of the convergence of the millennium, a possible visit
from Pope John Paul II and peace talks _ which always improve
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear that we are together in this, Israelis,
Palestinians and even Jordanians,'' said Avi Rosenthal, director
general of the Israeli Hotel Association. ``Everybody has a vested
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal hopes the millennium will build a foundation for
``regional tourism'' that would commonly take tours through
Palestinian areas, Egypt, Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It's normal in other regions, but still under-developed here
because of regional tensions. For example, Arabs usually refuse to
come to Israel because of the political conflicts between their
countries.

 &HT;    Chip is tracking device for humans
 &HT;    By Jeff Ostrowski
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Here's a high-tech tracking device not even
George Orwell envisioned: a gizmo slightly smaller than a dime
inserted under a person's skin.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach-based Applied Digital Solutions said this week that
it bought the patent for the implant, which it calls the Digital
Angel. People who use the transmitter _ powered by the carrier's
muscle _ could be tracked by global positioning satellite, the same
technology used in some luxury cars and boats.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sullivan, chairman and chief executive of Applied
Digital, sees a multibillion-dollar market for the implant.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who fear losing children to kidnappers might buy the
devices. People with Alzheimer's or heart disease might use the
transmitters so that medical help could arrive quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The chip would hold medical and financial information. There's
no need to worry about Orwell's Big Brother, Sullivan said, because
no one will be forced to have an implant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see that as an issue because it's a voluntary
thing,'' Sullivan said. ``We're in a voluntary world.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, he said, the implant could be a ``life-saving''
device.
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan also said the criminal justice system might use the
implants to keep track of prisoners released early.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians cringe at such uses of technology, which they
consider invasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation that can go in the blink of an eye from
being voluntary to being mandatory,'' said Emily Whitfield, a
spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Hendricks, editor of the Privacy Times newsletter, said
consumers should think hard before buying an implant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could get some bar code tattoos while they're at it,''
Hendricks said sarcastically. ``If a parent really wants to put a
chip in their kids, they have the right to do that. I would
encourage people to think long and hard about using something like
this for privacy and for medical reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Applied Digital is developing the device and hopes to have a
version available late next year. Sullivan wouldn't say how much
Applied Digital paid for the patent, only that he bought it from a
Boston-area group of inventors.
</P>
<P>
   The implant would consist of a chip surrounded by Teflon or
titanium. Sullivan described the implant as the size of a
thumbnail, or about the circumference of a dime, though slightly
thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Digital specializes in business-to-business e-commerce,
and Sullivan said the company plans to first use the device for
Internet security. The implant could let someone at a computer
verify the identity of another thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan says the e-commerce market for the chip could be worth
$10 billion to $12 billion. When parents, patients and other
customers are added to the list of potential buyers, sales could
reach $100 billion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   People unwilling to have the chips in their bodies could carry
them. The chips also could be placed on such items as valuable
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how much the chips would sell for.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he was overwhelmed with phone calls after he put
out a press release about the implant Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a very exciting future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy expert Hendricks doubts that consumers will clamor
for a device they've never needed before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a solution looking for a problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 4 million shares of Applied Digital (Nasdaq: ADSX, $7.69)
traded on Wednesday, twice the average daily volume. The stock
dropped 8 percent for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Deloitte &AMP; Touche named Applied Digital the fifth
fastest-growing technology company in the U.S. The company improved
on its ninth-place showing in last year's report.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, the company had a profit of $447,000 on
revenue of $107 million.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Digital employs nine people locally and about 2,000
globally. In June, the company changed its name from Applied
Cellular Technology.

&HT;     YOUNG OPERA FAN WANTS TO EMULATE THE TENOR OF MENTOR'S TONE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHRIS STURGIS  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROTTERDAM, N.Y. _ In 1994, 3-year-old Louis Lohraseb and his
mother were watching World Cup soccer on television when the
announcer said the next program would be a concert by the Three
Tenors.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Lohraseb assumed her son would rather hear from the Three
Stooges than the Three Tenors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to go in your room? You won't like this,'' Kim
recalled telling the boy. She was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Louis gave the classical music singers a listen and fell under
the spell of Luciano Pavarotti, who, along with Placido Domingo and
Jose Carreras, form the Three Tenors.
</P>
<P>
   ``His voice is beautiful,'' said Louis, now a poised and
enthusiastic 8-year-old who attends Jefferson Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 5 years old, Louis went to New York City with his
grandfather, Louis Miranda, to see Pavarotti sing at the
Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   At first, security personnel wouldn't let the pair go backstage,
but they changed their tune after the youngster demonstrated his
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last guard said, `I heard that you like to sing. Sing a
little,''' the boy recalled, his dark eyes shining. ``There were
2,000 people in the room, waiting in line. So I started singing `O
Sole Mio' and everybody started clapping.''
</P>
<P>
   A security guard produced a backstage pass. After the concert,
the youngster felt a mixture of excitement and nervousness. ``I was
shaking in my boots,'' Louis said. ``I couldn't stand still.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis sang, and his idol put two fingers to his lips and let out
a whistle. ``That's a singer,'' Pavarotti said, looking around for
a handkerchief to autograph. He was out of hankies, so his manager
suggested using a napkin from a fruit basket.
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti rejected that substitution, saying in Italian, ``What
are you doing with that dish cloth?'' the boy's grandfather
recalled. Both Louis Miranda and his wife, Mary, were born in Italy
and emigrated to the United States as teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Young Louis also saw Pavarotti in May when he performed in
Albany. This time he got a signed handkerchief. In July, he held
that souvenir as he sang for an audience of 1,500 at the inaugural
performance of the amphitheater in Schenectady's Central Park.
While he looked calm and poised on stage, his family could read his
nervousness in the twisting of the hankie.
</P>
<P>
   He also has appeared on the ``Rosie O'Donnell Show'' and
Nickelodeon's, ``Figure it Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis has never taken a voice lesson, picking up the mechanics
and expression of opera from videotapes and recordings. He learned
``like you study science. You look,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has taken piano lessons for three years, building on his
prodigious ability to play opera accompaniments by ear.
</P>
<P>
   He is writing an opera that his grandfather is helping translate
it into Italian. In August, Louis will travel with his grandparents
to Italy for a week, a trip paid for by the ``Rosie O'Donnell
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be able to show him things we wouldn't be able to,''
his mother said of her parents. ``Plus, they speak the language.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole family is a bit perplexed by Louis' love for opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us have any musical talent,'' his mother said. ``I
don't know where this came from.''
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather said: ``I like opera, but I really began to like
it when he began to sing. It's very, very unusual. It's a blessing
and gift.''

   APPLES-DALLAS (Dallas, Texas) _ The words and music have stuck
in my mind for 40-odd years, because they seemed so apt. Frank
Loesser wrote them for a musical called ``The Most Happy Fella,''
and they stopped the show every time. ``You're from Big D I can
guess,'' a brassy dame sang, ``by the way you drawl and the way you
dress. You're from Big D, my, oh yes. I mean Big D, little a,
double l, a, s. And that spells Dallas, my darlin', darlin' Dallas
... where every home's a palace, 'cause the settlers settle for no
less.'' Big money, big hair, big talk. Such is the lingering
stereotype of this city. It occupies a sizable spot in the national
consciousness as the home of the big, bad Dallas Cowboys, of J.R.
Ewing and Miss Ellie and all the gang at Southfork, and of the
little guy with the big ears and bigger ambition, H. Ross Perot,
who was a billionaire before he turned 40. And for those old enough
to recall the events of November 1963, it occupies an especially
dark corner of memory, as the cursed place where John F. Kennedy
was shot. Yet Dallas and its smaller sibling, Fort Worth, an
unmatched pair if ever there was one, amount to much more than
that. Together with the little cities that cluster around them like
pilot fish, they constitute the largest metropolitan area in the
nation's second largest state. They boast the largest collection of
major corporate headquarters outside of New York and Chicago. By
R.W. Apple Jr.

   TEXACO-OPERA (New York) _ Opera has long been saddled with the
perception that it is a pricey art form for elitist audiences. But
it is hard to make the elitism charge stick when for 60 years the
Saturday matinees of the Metropolitan Opera have been broadcast
live across the United States and Canada, sponsored by Texaco.
``The Texaco-Metropolitan Opera International Radio Broadcasts,''
as the series is officially called, represents the longest
continuous commercial sponsorship in broadcast history. (Met
performances were first heard on radio nine years earlier.) The
broadcasts have also been carried live in Europe since 1990.
Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong were added later, and this
year the network was extended to Brazil. When the current radio
season ends on April 22 with Wagner's ``Gotterdammerung,'' Texaco
will have sponsored the broadcasts of 1,192 live performances of
142 operas. It is estimated that 10 million listeners tune in each
season. What other art form has been made so available to so many
people for so long? By Anthony Tommasini.

   MET-DESIGN-EXHIBIT (New York) _ Proving once again that it can
mount a boutique of a show with the same panache as a five-alarm
blockbuster, the Metropolitan Museum has unveiled an exquisite
sampling of 20th-century design objects from its own collection. A
salute rather than a full survey, ``A Century of Design, Part I:
1900-1925'' is installed in several intimate galleries in the
20th-century wing. It displays more than 50 examples of furniture,
metalwork, glass, ceramics, textiles, jewelry and drawings, from a
fanciful Pompeiian-style dressing table of bronze and basalt by the
French designer Armand-Albert Rateau to a silver claret jug with
sinuous curves and flyaway thumb-piece, the work of the English
craftsman Archibald Knox. By Grace Glueck.

REACHING FOR THE HOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 By GERALDINE FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    On Monday night, I sat down for the fourth time in less then a
month to watch the Republican presidential candidates debate. And
the thought that cheered me most was the realization that this was
the last debate either party would be having this year, this
century, indeed this millennium.
 &HT;    It couldn't have come soon enough for me!
 &HT;    In all fairness, I must admit that I feel this way partly
because I'm a Democrat and, if Fox News weren't paying me to
politically analyze the event, I probably would have been out
Christmas shopping.
 &HT;    But there is a part of me that's very interested in getting to
know the men who have the potential to be the Republican nominee,
the men who might even _ heaven forbid! _ move into the White House
in January 2001.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, that interest was left unsatisfied. The debate
failed me _ but, far more important, it failed the Republicans
across the country who will be voting in the upcoming primaries and
caucuses.
 &HT;    Like me, those voters didn't have a chance to get to know the
men who might be president, because there were four other guys
standing up there, getting in the way.
 &HT;    Not that the problem is as simple as too many debaters. By their
very nature and because so much is at stake, presidential debates
shed little light on the political process and tell us very little
about the candidates. That's as true today as it was in 1984, when
George Bush and I were alone on the stage, standing across from
each other as our parties' vice-presidential nominees.
 &HT;    We were the ones up on the stage, but our staffs had done all of
the tough work _ in the process making it virtually impossible for
anything spontaneous or informative to emerge from the debate. They
had negotiated the height of the podium and of the box I'd stand
on, the color of the curtain behind us, the reporters who would ask
the questions and the time allowed for each answer and for each
followup.
 &HT;    We ourselves were even more painstakingly prepared. During
rehearsals our staff directed us on how to stand, how to move, how
to acknowledge the reporters, the audience and the other candidate.
They peppered us with every possible question, and provided
carefully packaged answers for each. My friend Bob Barnett played
George Bush in rehearsal, while my House colleague Lynn Martin was
playing Geraldine Ferraro for Bush.
 &HT;    Even after the debate, nothing was left to chance. Well before
the final handshake, our staffers had kicked into overdrive,
frantically spinning the story for the press, ensuring that
anything spontaneous or human that might have slipped out was
nudged back into ``the message.''
 &HT;    It's hardly comforting, watching these debates 16 years later,
to see that nothing has changed.
 &HT;    There is one difference, though: In 1984, the country at least
knew that one of us was going to be the vice president. These 1999
debates are tedious displays of poor theater, featuring a large
cast of characters, four of whom have in common that there's no way
they'll ever be president.
 &HT;    On Monday night, vote.com went online to ask for viewers'
opinions as to who had ``won'' the debate. It was interactive play
time, and the big winner was judged to be ... Alan Keyes.
 &HT;    Alan Keyes?
 &HT;    That many people thought he won is absolute proof that this
whole debate thing needs rethinking. He didn't advance a single
idea that we'd want to govern this country by, but he said whatever
it was he said with emotion, with commitment, with flair.
 &HT;    He was sharp, he was articulate, he was smooth. He showed the
theatrical skills he honed in college, on talk radio, on the
lecture circuit and, yes, on the campaign trail. With such an
accomplished presentation, does it matter that he didn't say a word
that made him seem like a plausible future president?
 &HT;    Well, no, probably it doesn't matter. Because, of course, he
will never be president. And neither will Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes
or Orrin Hatch.
 &HT;    So spare us.
 &HT;    It's time either to stop these silly, so-called ``debates'' or
to get serious about them. And if we want to get serious, a good
way to start is by clearing the stage.
 &HT;    Either Gov. George W. Bush or Sen. John McCain will be the
Republican nominee for president _ you know it, I know it and so do
all six men up on that platform.
 &HT;    Maybe it's time they did something about it.
 &HT;    Maybe for the good of their party and their country, they should
emulate Elizabeth Dole's leadership, exhibit Dan Quayle's
intelligence and get out. Take a quick bow and sit down.
 &HT;    And if they won't, perhaps it's time they were decorously pushed
into the wings, leaving enough time for us to get to know the two
men who have a measurable chance of becoming our next president ...
and to finish our Christmas shopping.

BEST WINTER DRIVING EQUIPMENT IS COMMON SENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winter driving should be a carefully thought out, cautiously
executed, top-to-bottom exercise.
</P>
<P>
   That's top to bottom as in, first, use your head, understand
that the mistakes you make driving in summer are mistakes you won't
get away with in winter; and, second, put the right tires on your
car.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, far too many folks will neglect the first, the
second, or both. When that happens, and you get into trouble _
can't stop quickly when you have to, or go into a skid on a
slippery turn _ you have to know how to get out of the mess you've
put yourself in.
</P>
<P>
   The head part involves common sense, says Tim O'Neil of the Team
O'Neil Rally School in Franconia, N.H. O'Neil, winner of multiple
rally championships in the United States and Canada, did most of
his racing on gravel, snow, and ice courses, so he knows something
about dancing on the edge of control.
</P>
<P>
   His first advice: Don't get to that edge. That means paying
attention to road conditions, knowing you can't stop or turn the
way you can on the good-gripping roads of summer. Watch the outside
temperature reading gauge that is offered in so many cars now. When
it drops from a warm day to 32 degrees and below, slow down.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to tires, snow tires on all four wheels is best,
especially if you're on the road a lot or your weekends take you
north for winter recreation. Snow tires are soft, so the rubber
moves around. They are ``stiped'' _ covered with thousands of tiny
sliced grooves that open to form thousands of little edges that
help them grip. And their treads are designed to ``work'' the snow
by packing it into strong Vs that give the tires bite.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled by mud-snow tires. Tires that do well in mud do
not do well in snow. Their clunky treads are made to spit out mud,
not work snow. Picture snow tires as boat shoes with all their tiny
slits giving grip on slippery surfaces. Picture mud tires like
clunky-treaded hiking boots.
</P>
<P>
   If you want all-weather tires, O'Neil advises, get soft ones _
sometimes the cheaper tires. Don't go for high-mileage all-weathers
because they are built harder to last longer. When it's slippery,
harder is bad. Check tires with your thumb. See if you can get the
rubber to move. These are best for winter.
</P>
<P>
   Now think about what kind of car you drive: all-wheel drive,
rear-wheel drive, front-wheel drive, four-wheel drive. For the most
part, says O'Neil, consider them all the same.
</P>
<P>
   At their base, he says, cars with all four wheels driving are
``incredibly helpful'' and driven properly, he says, ``are much
safer.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, their performance breeds overconfidence and
people think they can drive them faster. But many of these vehicles
are heavier (SUVs, pickup trucks, vans), less stable in turns, and
harder to stop in an emergency. And when they do get into skids, it
is nearly impossible to drive out of that skid as you might do with
a front-wheel- or rear-wheel-drive vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   So know they perform better, but drive them as carefully as you
would any other auto.
</P>
<P>
   But since we won't all ``be careful out there,'' as the Sarge
used to say on ``Hill Street Blues,'' here's what to do when the
two most likely emergency situations _ emergency stop, loss of
control in a slippery turn _ happen to you.
</P>
<P>
   --You're driving down a straightaway, are distracted a moment,
and see a car stalled ahead of you when you look back at the road.
Get ready to let go of your instincts.
</P>
<P>
   If your vehicle does not have ABS, use the pumping technique.
Touch your brakes until you feel the wheels are about to lock up,
release, pump again _ hopefully with a bit lighter touch on the
pedal. Release, and continue this diminishing pressure of pumping
until you either have to, or now safely can, attempt to steer
around the object ahead of you.
</P>
<P>
   When you're steering, don't hold the brakes on. This is where
you are going against instinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to release when your brain says, `I want to stop,'
'' says O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   If you do have ABS, slam the brakes on hard. The ABS system will
do the pumping for you. With the brakes on, steer around the
danger.
</P>
<P>
   --This time, you're in a corner, wheels turned, when you realize
the car is not going where you want it to. Instinct tells you to
let off on the gas or maybe hit the brakes. Either action transfers
weight from the rear to the front of your vehicle. Now you are
skidding. One of two things is likely happening.
</P>
<P>
   Say you are making a left-hand turn. Your rear end glides out
toward the right and is trying to pass your front (oversteer).
</P>
<P>
   Turn your wheels smoothly back to the right. Let off the brakes
_ and against instinct again, you may want to give it a bit of gas.
Gain control by turning into the turn. In bad skids, you may find
yourself going back and forth, right-left-right to fully halt the
alternating skids. But it works. Try it in a slippery abandoned
parking lot sometime.
</P>
<P>
   Now say you are making that left-hand turn but the nose keeps
going to the right (understeer). Don't think that by turning the
wheels more to the left that the car will suddenly catch on and go
that way. What you must do is let off the gas and turn to the right
until the car begins to go where you point it. You'll know this is
happening because you will feel the front wheels begin to grip
again. Now you can gently steer the car back to your intended line
_ or at least away from looming trouble.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil says understeer is more common in front-wheel-drive cars
while oversteer is more common in rear-wheel drive. All-wheel drive
has what he calls ``flat spin,'' in which the car will most likely
go immediately off the road. It's rare, but if you're not careful,
it can happen.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil describes his technique of teaching winter driving as
showing people ``how to avoid getting in the goo and what to do
when you are in the goo.''
</P>
<P>
   American drivers, he says, need to develop a better feel for
their cars and the skills needed in driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people die because they don't have the ability to get
out of a skid,'' he says. ``We should approach driving the way
pilots approach flying.''
</P>
<P>
   But the best advice _ though it will go unheeded by far too many
_ is this: Folks, be careful out there.

THE HONDA INSIGHT HYBRID CAR IS A REAL CAR, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever the prospect of driving an alternative energy vehicle
arises, two fair questions are inevitable: Does it drive like a
real car? How much hassle is it to keep it charged/ juiced/gassed?
</P>
<P>
   With the new Honda Insight, the first gasoline-electric hybrid
auto sold in the United States, the answers to those questions are:
Yes, remarkably so. And, no problem at all because any gasoline
station will do.
</P>
<P>
   I spent more than a week in Honda's spiffy two-seater and found
it had no problems climbing country hills, cruising effortlessly on
the highway, and, when the need arose, running nimbly where the big
dogs roam out in the passing lanes on the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   So yes, this is a real car. In the past, alternative energy
vehicles meant buyers paid a price in performance, convenience, or
comfort _ suffering for the environment. A noble cause, but when
real rubber met the road, not many people were willing to suffer
quite that much.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the future, if _ and this is the big if _ enough
drivers in the United States will turn at least partially away from
the big-rig fever that engulfs us and scoop up hybrids like the
Insight, Toyota's soon-to-be-available Prius, or myriad other
hybrid vehicles, including pickup trucks, sedans, or SUVs, that
will make their way to market by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The Insight, already on sale in California and in the East in
January, is a bargain right now at about $19,500. Honda
acknowledges it is selling the Insight at a loss, but says that is
because the car is a rolling technology platform, an investment
toward the day when buyers may line up to purchase Insights or
other Honda products with Insight's hybrid influence.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, they just want to get people into the Insight
to show what it can do.
</P>
<P>
   Again, this is a real car. It's a three-door hatchback that
seats two quite comfortably. Standard equipment includes power
windows and power steering, remote keyless entry, and antilock
brakes.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, it has a bit of a schizophrenic appearance. Up
front, it looks like any other Honda rolling toward you. Directly
from the rear, it looks Honda all the way. But from the sides,
especially the rear quarter panels with melded fender skirts, it
shrieks different, experimental _ too bad because all else is so
subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, you feel as if you could be sitting in any small Honda.
</P>
<P>
   The seats are broad, long, and firm, and driver and passenger do
not rub shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Instruments are simple and literally engaging. RPMs in a circle
to the left, charge status of the batteries in a circle to the
right, speedometer in a circle at center. But below these three is
where true engagement begins. Here you find a moving bar-graph that
tells you, as you give gas, let off on gas, coast, roll, draft
behind a truck, exactly what gasoline mileage you are getting at
that moment.
</P>
<P>
   You can't help but play with the gauge and even if you are not
out to set mileage records _ I was not and still averaged 61 miles
per gallon in more than a week of driving _ you find yourself
paying attention to the fuel you burn.
</P>
<P>
   Honda did this on purpose _ just as it added several ways to
figure average mileage over specific trips or the life of the car.
</P>
<P>
   So you're on a trip, rolling easily in highway traffic. Your
luggage is on the broad, flat deck above the battery pack behind
the seats. Trip incidentals fit nicely in a webbed pouch that hangs
behind and between the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Your 10.6-gallon gasoline tank has just been filled, your
battery pack is being regularly recharged, and you won't need to
pull into another gas station for well over 600 miles.
</P>
<P>
   How can this be?
</P>
<P>
   Think small gasoline engine, small electric motor, nimble
5-speed manual transmission, and ultra-lightweight materials in
engines, chassis, and suspension. Think aerodynamics (remember
those ugly rear quarter panels?).
</P>
<P>
   In hybrid autos, the electric motor assists the gasoline motor
in times of greatest need: acceleration, starting from a from a
standing stop, climbing steep grades. In the Insight (and this
differs from the Prius) the electric motor never is the sole source
of propulsion. This means the electric motor and the battery pack
can be kept small. And so can the gasoline engine.
</P>
<P>
   The Insight has a 1-liter, 3-cylinder, 67 horsepower, gasoline
engine. Mounted between it and the transmission is a round (small
pizza), 10-kilowatt electric motor that produces 13 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   The only time you notice something is different while driving is
when the car goes into idle stop _ and you put it there when you
come to a stop in traffic, shift into neutral, and let out the
clutch. The gasoline motor stops, but comes on again as soon as you
depress the clutch and shift into gear. Seamless, and it saves
gasoline sitting in traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   So you get your gasoline at stations, as always. But where do
you get a constant supply of electricity? It's called regenerative
braking. When you are applying the brakes, letting off the gas to
slow down in traffic, or the car is holding itself back on steep
downgrades, the electric motor runs in ``reverse.'' Remarkably, it
captures the energy created from all these braking procedures,
converts it to electricity, and stores it in the 144 D-cell sized
batteries that run that same electric motor on demand.
</P>
<P>
   Two small motors helping each other _ small not only because of
that symbiotic relationship, but also because of Honda's use of
lightweight materials in the Insight.
</P>
<P>
   Take the gasoline engine: 124 pounds, aluminum block, die-cast
one-piece aluminum head and exhaust manifold, plastic-resin intake
manifold, valve cover and water pump pully, magnesium oil pan.
Plunk this into an all-aluminum body and chassis, and you've got a
car that weighs about one ton.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 4-wheel independent suspension is made with aluminum
components _ you've got struts up front, a beam axle in the rear _
and they give the car a smooth, mostly sure ride. Only in the
corners did it seem a little too light on its feet, tracking just a
bit outside the steering line sometimes, and tracking a bit inside
the line on others. But, hey, it's not a car built for rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Honda hopes to sell 4,000 Insights in the United States this
year, and it is hard to believe those won't be scooped up. There
are at least that many potential buyers out there who get upset
every time this column praises the performance of one of those
gas-guzzlin', ozone-eatin', earth-destroyin' SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   For those folks, here's your chance to start making a statement
_ with minimal suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The hanging net behind the front seats. Accessible to both
driver and passenger. Holds many things of many sizes.
</P>
<P>
   --The see-through lower portion of the rear hatch. Good view
when backing up.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --Those rear quarter panels. I know aerodynamics were paramount,
but did they have to make the car look like a helmet worn by a
bicycle racer?

<TEXT>
<P>
   The number one health policy problem of the day _ the soaring
cost of prescription drugs _ is leading state officials and
consumer advocates to propose solutions once dismissed as radical.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators and public officials are exploring the idea of
combining entire state populations, perhaps even all of New
England, into giant drug purchasing groups to wrest the deep
discounts and rebates that drug companies now grant only to favored
customers such as large HMOs and Medicaid programs.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative under active discussion is whether states
can find ways to legislate pharmaceutical price discounts of 20 to
40 percent _ in effect, price controls at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   Such proposals are considered quixotic in Washington, but many
state legislators say drug manufacturers have less clout at their
level.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, constituents upset about high pharmacy prices _ such
as politically potent elders _ have more direct access to local
legislators, which make the lawmakers more vulnerable to
grass-roots pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Peter Shumlin, a Democrat who is Vermont's Senate
president, said he and his colleagues can't go to the barber shop
or grocery store without hearing ``a lot of sad stories about
people who can't afford to buy their drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike members of Congress, he added, state legislators don't
have to raise multimillion-dollar campaign chests to get elected
and therefore don't depend on contributions from the drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only makes sense, if Congress isn't going to do anything,
to explore how states can work together,'' Shumlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of concerted state action is catching fire in New
England as the best strategy to rein in prescription drug
expenditures rising by 15 percent a year. Pharmaceutical cost
increases are outstripping all other health sectors and threaten to
surpass total hospital expenditures in the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of state activism are suddenly everywhere, driven by
pressure on elders with no drug coverage, on families that face
escalating HMO premiums, and on state spending for Medicaid and
drug-subsidy programs.
</P>
<P>
   Shumlin plans to host a Thursday meeting in Montpelier of
legislative leaders and policy advisers from Massachusetts,
Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire to discuss how they might work
together to control the cost of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's strength in numbers,'' Shumlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts budget, passed last month, contains a
little-noticed mandate to create a drug-purchasing pool that could
encompass 25 percent of the Bay State's population. This fall,
California enacted a law that requires pharmacies to give discounts
of up to 40 percent to Medicare beneficiaries. Vermont is even
considering state-subsidized bus passes so residents could travel
to Montreal to buy drugs at about half of what it would cost in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators, health officials, and advocates have concluded
that state action to create large purchasing groups offers the
best, and simplest, approach. Prescription drug spending in the six
New England states totals an estimated $5.4 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it could be done,'' said Judith Kurland, regional
director of the US Department of Health and Human Services for New
England. ``The health care purchasing power of the six New England
states, with our 13 1/2 million people, is comparable to all of
Canada's, with its 29 million population.''
</P>
<P>
   The region's proximity to Canada, where drug prices are set by
individual provinces, also makes for telling contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Danyow, a 78-year-old breast cancer patient from St.
Alban's, Vt., made the trip to Quebec last July with four other
women from her ``healing group'' to buy tamoxifen, a cancer drug
that costs about seven times more south of the border, according to
a recent study by Vermont officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a three-month supply for less than $50,'' Danyow said.
The average Vermont retail price for the same quantity of tamoxifen
is $388.74, according to the state study.
</P>
<P>
   Kurland has no power to implement a regional drug-purchasing
``buyer's club,'' as she calls it. But the state governments might,
even in the face of expected opposition from the pharmaceutical
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, industry representatives vow to fight state
legislation on prices. They say that all such proposals are based
on wrong-headed notions of why US drug prices are so much higher
than in Canada or any other nation.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Powell, who handles government price control issues for
the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, cited
one study that found half of the price difference between the
United States and Canada is because the two nations have disparate
laws on product liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the provisions that make our system so much of a lottery
don't exist in Canada,'' Powell said. She notes that Canada does
not have strict product liability laws, allow class-action law
suits, permit punitive damages, or allow lawyers to launch suits on
the prospect of large fees from eventual awards.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman for the pharmaceutical association,
added that government price controls in the United States would
slow manufacturers' ability to develop new life-saving drugs.
Opponents criticize that claim, noting that drug companies spend
more on marketing and administration than they do on research and
development, reap the benefits of government-sponsored research,
and have plenty of room in their profit margins to fund new product
development.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's approach is more coverage for drugs ``rather than
government-imposed price constraints,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many states have focused recently on expanding coverage
to targeted populations, such as low-income elders and uninsured
families. But many are realizing these initiatives can't continue
if drug prices keep rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state simply cannot afford to subsidize the drug companies
without limits,'' said Geoffrey Wilkinson, executive director of
Massachusetts Senior Action Council.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacy price trends, for instance, will crucially affect the
feasibility of a Massachusetts plan to design an insurance program
to cover catastrophically high pharmacy costs for all elders _ an
effort mandated by the recent budget legislation. Untrammeled price
inflation, analysts say, would drive premiums so high that elders
could be discouraged from buying coverage when they are healthier,
offsetting the costs of heavier users.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' current budget includes a mechanism to negotiate
pharmaceutical prices on behalf of a group that will include
Medicaid recipients; low-income elders in the state's Senior
Pharmacy program; state, county, and municipal employees; and those
who are uninsured or underinsured.
</P>
<P>
   These groups may add up to 1.6 million people, or 1 in 4 Bay
State residents. The door may be opening, however, for a bolder
group-purchasing approach that would encompass the entire state
population. A proposal to accomplish this, filed annually since
1995 by Representative Pat Jehlen, a Somerville Democrat, is
attracting mainstream support.
</P>
<P>
   While New England legislators strategize and debate options,
consumers are left to stopgap measures, such as periodic
drug-buying trips to Canada. That's what Lucille Danyow expects to
do next month, when her latest cache of cancer medicine runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Last time, her husband drove her to Quebec. ``But he's 87,'' she
worried last week, ``and I don't know what the weather will be next
month.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Two Watchers are found floating in Tampa Bay.
Max ponders if they jumped off the Skyway Bridge, or were pushed?
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Tipped off by Max, the police began an inquiry into whether the
dead Watchers could have been dropped from a plane or helicopter to
make it look like a suicide leap off the Skyway Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injuries on these folks were unusually devastating,'' Sam
reported to Max over the telephone. ``The medical examiner says the
injuries are consistent with a drop of more than 200 feet _ but so
many things can affect this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any comment from Glaber?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Through a spokesman he said that young people, even Watchers,
killing themselves was a horrible thing, and a clear sign of a
troubled world tumbling toward its end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What an ass----.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He says The Watchers don't own a plane or helicopter. Only
boats, vans and cars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I saw something that could be a landing pad for a
helicopter _ out beyond the dunes near the Conquistador.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll check it out. What are you up to?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm writing like crazy, but today I'm going to call on a
friend, so I can get into the Star Dome and view the New Awakening
with my own eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, Max found himself on the southern tip of St.
Petersburg, in a neighborhood called Pinellas Point, where great
oak trees hung shade over lovely wide streets that for decades had
been paved with pink concrete. Most people called this place ``The
Pink Streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Max's face was as pink as the streets. He was jogging _ feeling
flabby and out of breath _ next to a tall, young black man, who
happened to be one of Florida's most beloved athletes, James
``Choirboy'' Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had grown up in St. Pete, one of the nation's only
five-sport athletes and an honors student at Lakewood High. At
6-foot-4, both nimble and strong, James played quarterback, point
guard and center field. He ran track. And he once joined the soccer
team to step in for an injured goalkeeper. He went to Florida
State, where he decided to concentrate on baseball. He was now in
his second season playing with the St. Pete Pelicans.
</P>
<P>
   Max had written about him after James' father was murdered in a
convenience-store robbery. The father, Charles Jones, was a great
preacher and pastor _ earning his son the nickname ``Choirboy'' _
and his death stunned the community.
</P>
<P>
   In his father's honor, James had committed half of his huge
salary to charitable work. He built houses for the working poor,
sponsored the construction of athletic fields in the poorest
neighborhoods, purchased books for a new library branch and could
often be seen on Sunday mornings at local churches, working with
pastors on their most pressing needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you want me to sneak you into the Dome for this Awakening
event. Don't you know I'm the Choirboy. I'm not exactly the sneaky
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``James, I didn't know where else to turn. You know everybody in
that place _ and The Watchers are barring the press, and they know
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max. I like you, my friend. The story you wrote made my mother
cry her heart out over my father _ but in a good way. So I'll help
you. But, to ease my Choirboy conscience, I must impose two
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Name them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, you have to come with me to church early Sunday
morning. Then for the rest of the day, you have to help me build a
house. Then, if you can still stand up _ by the way, you are way
out of shape _ we'll go to the Dome.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Sunday afternoon, every muscle in Max's body, including
some he didn't know he had, ached. Seven hours of bending, lifting,
hammering, lifting, bending, had taken their toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since I've worked like that, James. I
think I remember now why I became a writer. No heavy lifting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Words can be heavy, very heavy. But this is good for your
body, Max, and your soul. I can see that God ain't done with you
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   They hugged and Max remembered that Father Ralph had said the
same thing, using almost the same words.
</P>
<P>
   It was no trouble for James to get into the Dome, even on a
night when the building was closed to the public. They trusted him
with his own key. ``Max, you came to church with me. You helped me
build a house.''
</P>
<P>
   They were standing at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm gonna add one more stipulation. I've got a great idea
for how you can get in here, see everything you need to see and
still not be seen by a single Watcher. But it's gonna cost you.''
</P>
<P>
   Max could see mischief in the eyes of the Choirboy. ``Max,
you've got to beat me in a race around the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean I run and you crawl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, easier. You start at second base and I'll start out at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Max lost. His legs, tight from the day's work, slid out from
under him rounding third base, and by the time he recovered, he
could hear the fastest man in baseball whooshing by him. ``You've
got to promise you'll write about this, Max. Not now. But someday,
when I enter the Hall of Fame.'' Coming from the Choirboy, it did
not sound like bragging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll write your life story, James Choirboy Jones. I've never
met an athlete _ a man _ like you. Now where are you going to hide
me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Max lifted his eyes from the tip of his friend's finger, up, up,
up, till his head was bent back, staring at a thin catwalk leading
to a circular bank of huge speakers. Up, up, up, more than 250 feet
to the domed roof of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up there?''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max makes plans to sneak into the huge Watcher
convention, with the help of James ``Choirboy'' Jones, a great
athlete and champion of social justice.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   To get Max to the top of the Dome would require three things: a
guide, a rehearsal and a counter-phobic energy he did not believe
he possessed. James Choirboy Jones hooked Max up with the Dome's
master sound engineer, a short, silver-haired Italian man named
Rocky Como. From a distance, Rocky was the spitting image of Father
Ralph.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ain't the first guy to say so,'' said the man known as The
Rock. ``In fact I know the Good Father. If you are friends with the
Good Father and the Choirboy, maybe I can be your friend some day,
cause you got great taste in friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocky, I'm afraid of heights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to worry. You don't look down. You follow me and stare
right into the middle of my back. And breathe nice and steady.
Don't forget to breathe, or you'll die. But first you wear this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocky gave him a bright orange jump suit that said Star Dome
Sound on the back. It was a little big for Max, but he found it
light and comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   He stared up at the Dome roof. He saw four concentric circles _
metal catwalks that allowed workmen access to different parts of
the roof. The outer ring was the lowest, circling most of the
inside of the stadium. Only a few hitters could reach that catwalk.
The next ring in was also a home run, requiring a long, high fly to
reach it. The next ring in was higher still. A high pop-up could
reach it, but not often. The ball was in play.
</P>
<P>
   And then at the center, like the bull's eye in a target, was the
smallest and highest circle, home of the Dome's speaker system. A
person could hide behind those speakers, invisible to the crowd
below.
</P>
<P>
   Each circle was connected to the next by a thin metal gangplank
_ with protective sides _ acting as a kind of ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll come in through the service entrance, wearing that
gear. If anyone stops you, have them call me. I'll clear you.
You'll take Service Elevator 11 _ that's this one _ and it will
take you to the first catwalk. From that point on, it's a piece of
pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   The march that followed looked like a dog trying to follow a cat
across a circus tight rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slow down, Rocky. Take it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Max gripped the hand rails on the first ramp so tight it gave
him blisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stare at my back,'' Rocky said, over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, they had reached the final ramp, steeper
than the others, but shorter in distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't look down!'' But Max couldn't help it. Step, step ...
step ... step ... step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, you got here. One more step. Look up.''
</P>
<P>
   And there he was, but his heart raced like a fast ball, a
burning sweat stung his eyes and soaked through his clothes all the
way through the jumpsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, that ain't so hard,'' said Rocky, pointing to a safe
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Max regained his breath and composure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is perfect, Rocky. I'll be able to see everything. But
just one thing? How do I get down?''
</P>
<P>
   That night Max Timlin had a dream, and it was a doozy. It began
with the sound of a helicopter: tucka tucka tucka tucka tucka, and
he was the only passenger, but no one was at the controls. He was
sitting next to an open door, gaping wide, and the copter _ it was
black _ circled and circled over the Star Dome, till Max was dizzy
from the motion.
</P>
<P>
   An unseen hand pushed him in the back and he tumbled over, down,
down, head first, but then upright, waving his arms. He looked down
to see the great white roof of the Dome, like a lovely marshmallow
pie.
</P>
<P>
   He would be safe, he thought. But his body sliced like a hot
knife through the marshmallow, through layers of roof, and into the
stadium where he grasped at air until his hands locked on a piece
of metal, the third catwalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now batting for the Pelicans, James Choirboy JONES!'' But Max,
facing home plate could see it wasn't the Choirboy, but Glaber _
only huge _ on steroids.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch. The crack of the bat _ deafening _ and a shot like a
missile, the ball hit so hard it traced a path in the air, coming
at him, at him, hitting his right hand with the force of a grenade
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging by one hand now, and all the fans dressed in white
cheering as Glaber rounded the bases, the fans looking up at him
and laughing and pointing and chanting his name in derision:
``Max-well, Max-well.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing the grasp now and falling down, down, and gazing down, in
this dream, he saw not the green of the outfield turf, but the
night-black waters below the Skyway Bridge.

   THE STORY SO FAR: Reporter Max Timlin is hired by editor Kate
Banks to investigate a doomsday cult called The Watchers and
succeeds at penetrating their inner sanctum. Max confronts The
Watcher leader, Raoul Glaber. Max suspects that is not his real
name. He then learns that Glaber's protege, the beautiful Angela
Powers, is really the daughter of Kate Banks. Two Watchers are
found floating in the sea, suspected suicides. Violet helps Max
track down Glaber's real identity and earns his affection. Max
overcomes his fear of heights to spy on The Watcher's convention at
the domed stadium.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The crow's nest behind the speakers turned out to be the perfect
vantage point to view The Watchers' so-called ``New Awakening.'' A
work crew had erected makeshift bleachers across the outfield. The
doors had opened at noon, and Max watched as a sea of white
streamed in noisily, trying to get as close as possible to a
central stage, erected near home plate.
</P>
<P>
   White banners were hung everywhere with slogans such as WATCH
THIS! and WATCH WITH US and AWAKE AND AWARE.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers pumped stadium music. Rocky told Max to wear
earplugs, but all the sound was directed out from where he was
sitting. Whoever picked the music and big screen videos had a sense
of humor because all the songs had ``white'' in the title _ from
``White Christmas'' to ``A Whiter Shade of Pale'' to, amazingly,
Billy Idol's ``White Wedding.'' Max curled his lip reflexively.
</P>
<P>
   The lights went out, and the crowd hushed and then became more
excited, like a rock concert, anticipating the featured act. Then
more music, the familiar throbbing of that great rock anthem of
paranoia and stalking, the rhythm like a heartbeat over Sting's
persistent voice: ``Every step you take, every move you make ...
I'll be watching you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a blast of crisscross laser beams, as bright white lights
shone on Glaber and his minions _ all dressed in blood-red tuxedos
_ almost 30 of them _ all blond or bald, except Glaber whose hair
was dark _ and one woman in a red, skintight, formal dress. Angela
Powers.
</P>
<P>
   Glaber raised his hand for silence. ``You know,'' he began,
``I've been following the stock market recently ...'' He paused,
and the crowd laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So here we are less than a month before a new millennium, and
the market is down. Now where is Wall Street's confidence? My
children, the economies of the world are about to crumble. Those
who put their stock in gold, now have rust. Those who put their
stock in lust, now have AIDS. Those who put their stock in the
religions of your fathers, are left with empty promises. Pie in the
sky when you die.'' More laughter and applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what about all of you who have put your stock in me? What
do you all have?''
</P>
<P>
   The Watchers rose as one in prolonged waves of cheers and whoops
and cries, morphing finally into a chant of their leader's name:
``Ra-ool, Ra-ool.'' It shook the stadium, and Glaber put his hands
on his hips, nodded up toward the cheap seats, and smiled, looking
every bit the presidential candidate about to give an acceptance
speech.
</P>
<P>
   They showered him with love, dancing and jumping up and down the
aisles, waving placards that pronounced their place of origin: New
York, California, Montreal, Brazil, Denmark, even Japan.
</P>
<P>
   From Max's watchtower it looked like he was staring into a
microscope at some strange organism, vibrating with energy,
changing shape, a source of fascination and mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you have been through the rite of initiation _ you have
shed the garments of darkness for robes of white. And let me say
that some of you look better without your clothes than others.'' He
glanced toward Angela. Waves of laughter. ``We on this stage wear
red, as you all will wear red in a new dawn, blazing with blood and
fire.'' That quieted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today you will experience a New Awakening. If there are any
among you who still slumber _ if your right eye is closed _ it will
be opened. With opened eyes we will watch together. For it is
ordained that we shall not watch alone. And so today, before you, I
will take unto me a bride.''
</P>
<P>
   The news caught the crowd by surprise, until people started to
point and call out, and before long they were cheering and chanting
her name: ``An-gel-a, An-gel-a.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber reached out her hand for her. She stood slowly, holding
her hands over her face, but Max could not tell the nature of the
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let that poor girl go! Let her go, I say. Give her her
freedom. Freedom, I say, freedom!'' The new voice was loud and
strong, coming clearly through the sound system. The voice was
familiar to Max, but it was not Glaber's.
</P>
<P>
   The group on stage stood and looked at each other and around the
stadium in search of the phantom voice. People in the crowd were
pointing. ``Up here, Glaber. Up here, on the catwalk.''
</P>
<P>
   Max turned to see a solitary little man, dressed in an orange
jump suit, wearing a halo of silver hair. He was looking down, like
Moses descending from Sinai, and was holding a wireless mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God,'' said Max aloud, ``it's Rocky, the sound engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Glaber,'' the voice boomed again. ``This is the day of a Great
Awakening, all right. And it's time for all these people to wake up
and see you for what you really are. A no-good stinker. A coward. A
bum.''
</P>
<P>
   Max stood up straight in his crow's nest, this interloper's
words ringing in his ears, vibrating from the speakers through his
body. It was not Rocky Como after all, he realized. ``It's Father
Ralph.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: The Watcher convention is a giant party for
Raoul Glaber until it is crashed by a little man with silver hair _
Father Ralph.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, time meant nothing for Max. It did not matter to him
whether it took two minutes or two days to climb down from his
crow's nest atop the domed stadium. When he got down during his
rehearsal, he had Rocky Como's back to stare at, and his
encouragement. But now it was just Max in an empty stadium, the
event he had witnessed so extraordinary, he couldn't get it out of
his head, even as he inched down the gangplanks and across the
catwalks towards the safety of sea level.
</P>
<P>
   He even prayed, which was not his style. ``Dear Lord, who so
inspired Father Ralph, please get me down off this damn thing.
Sorry about the damn.''
</P>
<P>
   As he descended _ always trying to look out, not down _ Max
replayed the events of the last few hours, again. He could not even
estimate how long they took. Time stood still. Or it sped up. Or it
reversed its field, creating a moment fit only for history,
mythology, or literature: the Knight playing chess with the figure
of Death; Christ facing the Grand Inquisitor; Clarence Darrow
cross-examining William Jennings Bryan during the Scopes Monkey
Trial; Don Juan in Hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you Satan?'' Raoul Glaber had asked Father Ralph, who
stood safe and solitary on a catwalk above the crowd, wearing the
orange jumpsuit of a sound engineer, clutching a wireless mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm just a man. I'm not Satan. I'm not an angel. I'm not a
prophet. Just a man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And why have you come here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To save that young woman.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to Angela Powers, who stepped back from Glaber and
looked down, as if in shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is loved here. But she is free to leave,'' said Glaber,
who gestured to the crowd. ``They are all free to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you know about freedom, Mr. Bigshot Watcher, Mr. Red
Tuxedo? There is no true freedom without responsibility. And you
act with no responsibility toward that woman, or to any of these
young people. If you did, you would not hide behind a false mask
and a false name. You would not offer them despair in the guise of
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I offer them despair, old man?'' Max sensed a subtle
shift in Glaber's voice, an erosion of his arrogance and
self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say that the human race has proved unfit for saving. I say
you're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You say this, old man, in the last days of a century that gave
us Hitler and Stalin and Pol Pot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not deny it. But can you deny that it also gave us Gandhi
and Mother Teresa and Nelson Mandela and Jonas Salk and Dr. King
and my mother _ the woman was a saint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around you, old man, look at the world with your eyes
opened, and not through the nostalgic blindness of your senility.
Your generation left these children with ashes.'' This brought
scattered applause from a crowd that seemed unsure how to respond
to this debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What year were you born, oh great leader of The Watchers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I tell you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you afraid of me? An old man, as you say. Can't you answer
a simple question? The truth cannot harm you here _ with your many
followers, surrounded by your guards and cronies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in 1950.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, so you'll turn 50 in the year 2,000. And you've chosen a
bride young enough to be your daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph paced as he spoke now, and raised his arms to the crowd
melodramatically. ``Kids. Don't you get it? Your leader is about to
turn 50. He's over the hill. He's playing the back nine. He wants a
trophy bride. He rides around in a power boat. Your prophet is not
ushering in a new millennium. He's having a midlife crisis!''
</P>
<P>
   This remark brought some scattered bursts of laughter, but these
were shouted down, until an angry murmur spread throughout the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't I send my helpers up there and have you thrown
into the street?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you are afraid of me, son.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I an NOT your son.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber lost his cool, Max could hear it in his voice and see it
in his body language. ``You are NOT my father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're God's son. Just love God, and love these children
enough _ love that young woman enough to free her. Free them all.
Let them go. Young lady ...''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph's voice was comforting now, as if he were sitting across
the table from her, sharing a cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young lady. You're free to go. Go ahead. Go.''
</P>
<P>
   With that Angela Powers dashed off the stage, her hand across
her face, as if to hold back tears. She ran like an athlete, even
in that slinky red dress and high heels, past a confused palace
guard, down a runway and out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tolerated your intrusion, old man _ I think you are
Satan _ but now you have gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber was beginning to rant. He gestured to three burly blond
men at the edge of the stage who ran off. To find Angela? To get
Ralph? Max couldn't tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing you can do to harm me,'' said Ralph. ``I do
not fear you. And, children, I do not fear the world. Embrace it.
Do not hate it. Walk out now. Go find a phone. Call your parents.
Wish them a Merry Christmas. Go visit them on New Year's Eve. Bring
some nice pastry. Buy them a Tony Bennett or a Frank Sinatra CD.
Watch the football games. Enjoy. Listen to that word. Enjoy. It has
joy in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber stared up, speechless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those fingers in my hair, That sly come hither stare, That
strips my conscience bare _ It's witchcraft.'' Max was laughing
now, wanting to leap from his perch down to Ralph, to hug him and
lift him up like a prizefighter and raise his hand in victory.
Ralph was breaking into his Frank Sinatra medley. ``I've got the
world on a string, Sittin' on a rainbow, Got the string around my
finger, What a world, What a life, I'm in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber screamed and twisted around, ``Is there no one here who
will rid me of this Satan in the guise of an old man?''
</P>
<P>
   At that remark the crowd grew angry. People stood and shook
their fists at Ralph, or threw cups or plastic water bottles at
him. But it appeared as if a few others were trying to restrain
them. A fight broke out in the upper deck, and then another in the
mezzanine. Glaber's entourage tore off the stage, running to the
trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
   Max looked down at the chaos. From his vantage point, it looked
like an illuminated manuscript of Dante's Inferno, a vibrating mass
of humanity, trapped in its own confusion and agony. And there, in
the middle, standing on the stage alone, his arms held wide, his
head down, like a crucified icon, was Glaber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one more thing before I go,'' said Father Ralph. ``A
little something from the poet T.S. Eliot: `In the end is my
beginning ... In the beginning is my end ... And the end of all our
exploring / Will be to arrive where we started /And know the place
for the first time.' Have a nice day.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, a group of Glaber's men appeared on the lower
catwalk, and just as quickly Ralph disappeared through a doorway,
his voice an echo in the great stadium.
</P>
<P>
   More fights broke out in the stands, with two men clutching at
each other, leaning dangerously over a high railing. A new
commotion raised the decibel level higher as city police streamed
into the stadium, wearing yellow vests and riot gear.

 &HT;    DID THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM SHINE ON PAPER ONLY?
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Dec. 19.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Rutgers University astronomer has combed through
ancient documents to find a startling new explanation for the
Biblical ``star of Bethlehem.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Molnar believes the ``wise men from the East'' who came
to worship the newborn Jesus in the account of the gospel-writer,
Matthew, were actually responding to a powerful astrological sign
portending the birth of a very great, perhaps immortal, king in
Judea.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than the bright celestial object depicted on zillions of
Christmas cards, Molnar thinks such an astrological sign would have
caused the ``wise men'' to go first to Jerusalem, then to
Bethlehem, on the night of April 17 in the year 6 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Molnar's theory has excited astronomers, who have for many years
speculated that the guiding star was a supernova or a triple
conjunction of planets, or maybe even an appearance of Halley's
comet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Molnar has found the star of Bethlehem. I believe him and I'm
embarrassed, dammit,'' said Yale University astronomer Bradley
Schaefer. ``This material has been around for centuries, and no one
looked at it until now.''
</P>
<P>
   The new explanation, Schaefer says, accommodates ``the entire
spectrum'' of belief. Those who would take the Biblical account
almost literally can read validation of the story of the three wise
men in Molnar's theory. Skeptics might believe the Gospel of
Matthew was rewritten a century or more after Jesus' birth to
include the story of the wise men on the basis of known
astrological history.
</P>
<P>
   Molnar, who has a doctorate in astronomy but currently works as
a Rutgers computer programmer, presented his theory to the
astronomy department of Harvard University on Thursday. He
describes it in the new book, ``The Star of Bethlehem: the Legacy
of the Magi'' (Rutgers University Press.)
</P>
<P>
   Molnar says he was led to his theory by an ancient coin.
</P>
<P>
   Biblical scholars are unsure about the historical date of
Jesus's birth, but it almost certainly was not on the night of Dec.
24-25, 1,999 years ago. Dec. 25 was originally a pagan holiday
which early Christians co-opted. Comparisons of the Biblical
account with Roman records suggest Jesus was born several years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Dean Kingsbury, professor of New Testament at Union
Theological Seminary in Richmond, Va., said many scholars think the
true date was sometime in 5 or 6 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew's Gospel states:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,
saying, 'Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we
have seen his star in the East and have come to worship him.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all
Jerusalem with him; and assembling all the chief priests and
scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to
be born. They told him, 'In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is
written by the prophet.' ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from
them what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem,
saying, 'Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have
found him bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When they had heard the king they went their way; and lo, the
star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came
to rest over the place where he was. When they saw the star they
rejoiced exceedingly with great joy and going into the house they
found the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and
worshiped him.''
</P>
<P>
   Molnar, a coin collector who specializes in ancient coins with
astronomy themes, said that several years ago he bought a bronze
Roman coin, dated around 13 A.D., at a coin show. One side bore the
image of Jupiter, the pre-eminent god of the Roman pantheon. The
other side had an astrological sign, the ram of Aries, looking at a
star.
</P>
<P>
   He paid $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends kidded me and said it was worth only $10,'' he said.
``It turned out to be worth a lot more than that, I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Researching the history of his new coin, Molnar learned it was
struck in the Roman city of Antioch, today a part of Turkey, to
commemorate the Romans' annexation of Judea. The sign of Aries
represented Judea, Molnar said he learned.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first clue. Previously, historians have believed
the zodiacal sign for Judea was Pisces. Molnar said he traced this
belief back to the Renaissance, but ancient writings state
specifically that the sign for Judea was Aries.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinated by this discovery, Molnar dug further into ancient
astrology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a highly respected subject by people in those days,
the Romans, the Greeks and others,'' he said. ``Astrologers were
the scientists of their day.''
</P>
<P>
   However, they may have seldom looked at the sky, Molnar
believes. Instead, they studied their charts to follow the planets
migrating through the heavens along paths plotted over the
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Those charts would have shown that in the spring of the year 6
B.C., the planet Jupiter was approaching the moon, in itself a
momentous event in the eyes of ancient astrologers. Jupiter was the
regal star and its approach of the moon would have signaled a royal
birth, Molnar says.
</P>
<P>
   Using his personal computer, he determined that at the time,
both Jupiter and the moon were between the Earth and the
constellation Aries, suggesting that the expected birth would be in
Judea.
</P>
<P>
   But the signs were even stronger. Jupiter was actually eclipsed
by the moon on two dates, March 20 and April 17, in 6 B.C., he
said. Adding to the power of the astrological event was the fact
that the sun was also in the constellation Aries.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the computer, he searched for a time when Jupiter
was shining as a morning star _ in the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``To you and me, that doesn't mean much,'' he said, ``but 2,000
years ago, it meant it was the most powerful time for a star. In
those days, it was big news.''
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter, he found, was in the east on April 17, the precise day
it was eclipsed the second time by the moon. Moreover, Saturn was
also in the constellation Aries on that date, and several other
planets were clustered near the constellation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To these people, these were extremely powerful signs of a
wondrous event, and they would have gone to search for the person
who was being born on that date,'' he said. ``They would have gone
first to Jerusalem, the capital of Judea.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted also that while the Romans, Greeks, Persians and other
Gentiles of the day subscribed to the astrological theories
developed around the planets and constellations, the monotheistic
Hebrews did not. News from the eastern wise men would have
bewildered King Herod ``and all of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Molnar started writing his book several years ago, and had
almost completed it when he discovered a book written in 337 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the Roman historian Firmicus Maternus, who had
converted to Christianity, described the same astrological signs.
Molnar's theory had been spelled out more than 1,600 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The astrological signs, Maternus wrote, suggested ``the birth of
a divine and immortal person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was talking about Jesus,'' Molnar said.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew's account says the three wise men did not return to
Herod to describe the infant king they found in Bethlehem, but,
warned in a dream, ``departed to their own country by another
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Herod continued to fret about the birth of a rival king,
according to Matthew, and eventually had all male children under
two years old in Bethlehem killed. Also warned in a dream, Joseph
took his wife, Mary, and their son to Egypt, where they remained
until Herod had died. They then returned to Nazareth in Judea,
where Jesus grew to manhood.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say Herod died in 4 B.C., two years after the night
Molnar believes the star of Bethlehem led wise astrologers to Judea
in search of a newborn king.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Father Ralph debates the leader of The
Watchers, and, along the way, secures the freedom of Glaber's young
bride-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max rushed back to the newspaper office, where Kate and her team
had assembled. They debriefed him on what he had seen at the
stadium, but not before he had a quick private conversation with
Kate about how Glaber had announced that Angela would become his
bride, how Father Ralph had dramatically intervened, how Angela was
last seen running out of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Kate crossed her arms and bit her lip, worried more than ever
about her daughter's safety and her mental state.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted but driven by adrenaline, Max wrote a 3,000-word memo
on what he had witnessed and turned it over to an editor. He picked
up the phone and dialed Violet's extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Max,'' she said sweetly. ``I guess this means you made it
down from the dome ceiling safe and sound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Check your e-mail for my memo, Violet. It was amazing. I'm
heading back to the condo. But I want to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see you, Max,'' said Violet, and then, ``and not
just see you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Violet. Glaber says he was born in 1950.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's telling the truth, that will help.''
</P>
<P>
   Max cruised home, still replaying the events of the day. The
police had arrested 50 Watchers. Angela Powers was missing. Raoul
Glaber had to be led from the stage by one of his followers. Father
Ralph Rizzo was _ well, for all Max knew _ he was eating lasagna
and listening to a Frank Sinatra CD.
</P>
<P>
   When Max let himself in to the condo, he knew right away that
something was wrong. All the lights were on, and the television
blared, turned to the local station, which was reporting news of
the arrests at the Dome. He heard music coming from the back.
</P>
<P>
   Max suddenly wished Daisy had been there as a watchdog, but Evie
had returned from California and retrieved the famous Skyway pup.
``HEY!'' barked Max, ``who's here?''
</P>
<P>
   He grabbed a golf club _ a 2-iron _ from the front closet and
hefted it with two hands over one shoulder as if it were a baseball
bat. He stepped cautiously through the place, peeking around
corners, into one bathroom, the bedrooms, the office. All the
lights were on.
</P>
<P>
   Then finally he poked a door open with the end of his club. It
squeaked, and Max could see that someone had lit candles beside the
Jacuzzi and was listening to classical music. Bach, he thought. The
candles flickered from the gulf breeze, sending odd shadows across
the room, shadows of a human figure, whose body now made ripples in
the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can come in, Max. It's only me.''
</P>
<P>
   He took one more step, and there she was, still beautiful and
once again in the water without the benefit of clothes. He gazed on
the face and body that could distract even the head of The Watchers
from his millennium watch. Angela Powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do me one favor, please,'' said Max. ``Put something on.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she turned a dial which sent bubbles across the surface
of the water, concealing her nakedness. She slid down, so only her
face and kneecaps were visible. ``How's that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine. Why did you drug me at the hotel?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know they put a drug in your ice tea, Max. I swear I
didn't. I didn't know a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That he wanted me to marry him, for goodness sake. There's
been nothing like that between us. That came out of the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What else?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Or that Watchers were going to start jumping off the bridge. I
knew those four people. I thought they were looking forward to a
new life _ I can't imagine what drove them to suicide. When I
started asking questions, all I got back were strange vibes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand one thing. From what I've learned, you
could be a brain surgeon or an Olympic athlete or a Victoria's
Secret model. What drove you to a windbag like Glaber?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could answer that, a lot of my problems would be solved.
Maybe my mother could tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does she know you're here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. But she gave me a key to the place. I'm glad I kept it. I
love my mother. Can you believe that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's heartsick over what's happened to you. And frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went off the deep end when my father died. I admit it. We
were so close. He raised me, directed me, coached me, cared for me,
while my mom was off working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So Glaber became your substitute daddy?'' Max said it with
sarcasm, and then regretted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ridicule me, Max. It's not that simple. Raoul was
charming and persuasive _ and his challenges about the world
stimulated my thinking. Why not become part of something big and
important? When he took an interest in me, started calling me
Angela, it raised my status in the group. It was like I was Chelsea
Clinton, or a beautiful princess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've hurt a lot of people for a little bit of attention and
celebrity, Angela Powers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please call me Cassie. I want my old name back. And my old
life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good first step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you hand me that robe, please?''
</P>
<P>
   Max picked the blue one, instead of the white, handed it to her
and turned away, and closed his eyes for good measure as she slid
out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry you were hurt, Max. And I'm sorry my mom ...'' She
began to sob. ``And I'm afraid something really bad is going to
happen on January 1st _ and if anyone else gets hurt _ I'm sorry.
So sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   She dropped her head straight forward till her forehead hit Max
in the shoulder blade. It hurt. Max put his arm around her and
ushered her back inside. ``Come on. Let's call your mother and let
her know you're all right.''
</P>
<P>
   But as they stepped through into the living room, there stood
three burly blond men, dress in white. Angela screamed. Max grabbed
the lamp and threw it at them. One blocked it with his forearm then
grabbed Max, spun him around and locked the vice of his arm against
Max's windpipe until the room got darker and slipped from under
him.

<P>
   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max returns to the condo, where Angela Powers
is hiding. There they are attacked by Glaber's henchmen. Angela is
kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   When Max came to, someone was leaning over him. A woman, he
surmised, or a man with long, sweet-smelling hair that tickled the
side of face. In fact, the person was blowing air into his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   It was a woman, and Max pushed her aside, turned his head and
coughed, leaning up on one elbow and rubbing his throat with his
free hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw them load Angela Powers, she was wearing a blue
bathrobe, into a white van.'' It was Violet. ``And I could see your
front door was open. I ran up and found you on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you save my life, Violet?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I'm not sure you were breathing.'' Her hands
started to shake. ``Should I call 911? Are you all right, Max?''
</P>
<P>
   She helped him to his feet. ``Let's call the cops, Violet. In
fact, let's call Sam Lockhart. I've got his direct number.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam issued an all-points bulletin for Cassandra ``Angela''
Powers. He sent detectives to the Conquistador Hotel to question
Glaber, but neither he nor his henchmen could be found. The
rank-and-file Watchers claimed no knowledge of their whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Violet stayed at the condo with Max, who was dizzy. She fixed
him a cup of tea, rubbed the soreness out of his neck and
shoulders, and even tucked him into bed, kissing him a gentle good
night, and running a hand through what was left of his hair. He
dropped off immediately and fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.
</P>
<P>
   He woke up feeling refreshed, even though this December morning
brought another wave of heat and humidity. Before noon it would hit
well into the 90s. Such weather was common from May through
October, but this December blast was both unusual and demoralizing.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas in Florida was hard enough, no snow for years, but
this weather smelled like tropical funk. El Nino by way of Jimmy
Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   He made a quick list of possible icons of the bizarre holiday
season: Scrooge wearing Bermuda shorts. Gingerbread men baking on
the beach. Rudolph with zinc oxide smeared on his nose. Frosty the
Snowman getting a fatal suntan. Suzy Snowflake becoming a crispy
cornflake.
</P>
<P>
   Max filled the passing days with work, writing and reporting,
until Christmas Eve arrived, one week until New Year's Eve, until
Millennium Eve. All the big parties would be next week. But he
decided on a small one, in the afternoon, so people could meet
their family and church commitments.
</P>
<P>
   His guests rolled in to the condo about two in the afternoon,
dressed more for Labor Day than Christmas, carrying cookies, and
salads, and casseroles, bottles of cold beer and wine.
</P>
<P>
   Violet had arrived early to help Max get the place ready. She
wore green shorts and matching halter top, with a red ribbon and
bow draped across her body, beauty queen style.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Banks arrived next, looking somber, like she needed a
drink. Still no word about her daughter, but every cop and reporter
in town was on the lookout. Violet did her best to comfort and
reassure her.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Darling arrived wearing a Santa hat and carrying a
disposable camera, which actually brought a little laugh from Kate.
Sherry, as was her habit, hugged the breath out of each of them _
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Father Ralph came next, wearing his favorite Hawaiian shirt,
lugging pastries and a gift for Max, a Frank Sinatra CD. Kate shook
his hand firmly and thanked the priest for helping her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Next came James ``Choirboy'' Jones, who posed for a picture next
to Father Ralph. They made a comic couple: Wilt Chamberlain
towering over the mayor of Munchkin Land.
</P>
<P>
   They were joined next by the police chief, Sam Lockhart, who
gave them an update on the search for Kate's daughter, and the
investigation of Glaber and The Watchers. Everything was being done
that could be done, he assured them. He would update Max each day,
personally. It was unlikely that Glaber would have escaped the
area. ``We think he's still here. And I'll wager we find him
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Father Ralph,'' said Kate. ``How did you pull that stunt at
the Dome? How did you get in with the sound crew?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You think Max is the only one with connections?'' he smiled.
``You think it's possible that an old priest might call up a young
superstar like the Choirboy and maybe ask a little favor? And, I'm
not afraid of heights either.''
</P>
<P>
   They all turned and laughed at Max, who affected a sheepish
look.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone filled their plates with the holiday grub and took
seats on the couch or on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father,'' said Sherry, who was Catholic. ``Do you want to say
grace?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' he said, ``Let's eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The doorbell rang. Evie Hamilton walked in, dressed immaculately
in a gold holiday frock, with Daisy, wearing a red bow around her
neck, bounding in behind her. It took Daisy, who would be spending
the week with Max, a good hour to make the rounds, gathering hugs,
pats and belly rubs wherever she could get them.
</P>
<P>
   By about six o'clock, the gathering had run out of gas, with
people beginning to stretch their legs, collect their plates, and
discuss their family plans for the rest of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Kate would hang out with friends. Max, Violet and Daisy would
work the beach, looking for Santa to come in on water skis, being
towed by dolphins. Father Ralph invited everyone to midnight Mass
at the clinic. Choirboy and his mom had the family over. Sam and
his wife were hosting an annual party for his top assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you all to know how important all of you have been to
me in the past months,'' said Max, adopting a voice he was not used
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me happy to have you all together here with me for
just a little while. When Kate hired me to work on this story, I
was feeling more than a little burned out. But, I don't know,
something about this story, and all of you, have brought me back.
I've been drugged. I've been choked. I've had to listen to Ralph do
his Sinatra imitation.'' They all laughed. ``I've slept with a
great dog. A dog that survived a drop from the Skyway Bridge.''
More laughter and then the sound of a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Lockhart answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``When did this happen?'' he said, and then several ``uh-huhs.''
He looked around the room as he listened. ``And where is he now?
I'll be damned. Any sign of Glaber or the girl? We'll be right
down.'' He hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, you were right. Those Watchers didn't jump off the Skyway
Bridge, they were dropped from a small plane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They just dropped another one. No, Kate, not your daughter.
It's a tall, skinny white boy without any hair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that kid,'' said Max. Sherry nodded. ``We saw him at
the initiation. Is he dead? Did they fish him out of the water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. I guess this is a Christmas miracle, but he's alive. He
was pushed out of a small plane. Or he jumped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did he land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the roof of the Star Dome. Hit near the top, took one big
bounce like a trampoline, and slid down and hooked on to the ledge.
Folks drinking on the patio of Jake's Sports Bar saw the whole
thing. They're taking him down now.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Violet comes to Max's rescue, and they spend
days working with police on finding the kidnapped Angela. A
Christmas Eve gathering is interrupted by a shocking phone call.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Sam Lockhart and Max raced from the beach to the Dome in
separate cars. The chief of police even loaned Max a portable
rotating police light he could stick on the dashboard of the
Mustang. He felt like a kid with a new Christmas toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if somebody had given Glaber his own police light,'' Max
mused, ``it would have satisfied his thirst for power.''
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived, they found the Dome lit up like a movie set.
Max counted seven police cars _ the police station was right across
the street _ three news trucks, two news helicopters, a police
helicopter, three fire trucks, one with a long ladder extended to
the lip of the Dome roof, and maybe 200 onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   Two rescue workers had succeeded in hooking a harness to the
young man, and were beginning to lower him to the ground. Max was
close enough to recognize him, the hairless Watcher he had first
seen on the shore of Cosmos Key during the initiation ceremony.
From Max's vantage point, the kid looked limp and lifeless, a rag
doll.
</P>
<P>
   They unhooked him on the ground, placed him on a stretcher and
rolled him into an ambulance. A detective approached Sam and Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is conscious, but incoherent. He looks OK from the
outside, but they'll be checking him for internal injuries. We
can't tell if he fell, jumped, or was pushed out. These people saw
the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   An older couple approached now and described how they had been
on the patio of a sports bar, drinking merrily and singing
Christmas songs with their friends, but their Yuletide gaiety was
interrupted by the drone of a small plane: ``The kind that flies
over the beach dragging commercial signs,'' said the woman.
</P>
<P>
   The plane flew a tight circle over the Dome, when a figure,
clearly visible in white against the night sky, dropped straight
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked for a chute to open, or a bungee cord,'' said the
man, ``like it was a publicity stunt, but he just landed near the
top of the Dome, bounced once, and then slid out of sight. I
expected to find him on the ground, dead. We screamed for the
bartender to call 911, rushed over here, and saw he was hooked on
the ledge of the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam thanked the couple and turned to the detective. ``Any word
about the plane? Anyone call saying they lost a passenger?''
Negative.
</P>
<P>
   Max and Sam drove to the hospital and waited for more than two
hours before a doctor came out to see them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That roof is made of a tough fiberglass. It was no kiddie ride
down that thing. He's got what amounts to second degree burns down
his back from the slide. He's cracked his pelvis. Maybe busted some
ribs. But he's very much alive. The roof had enough give to cushion
his fall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we talk with him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given him something for the pain, but you can try. Take
it easy, though. He's in Room 211.''
</P>
<P>
   Max stood back and let Sam conduct the interview. The young man
was lying on his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, son, you've had quite a fall. What's your name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas. Thomas Day.'' Max took a step closer to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK. Thomas. Tell us how you fell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't fall, man. I jumped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You jumped out of the plane? Why did you do that, Thomas?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were going to push me out. Like the others.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The four Watchers who were found in the Bay?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew those people, man. They were good people.'' He winced.
``I didn't think they would kill themselves, so I started asking
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To Glaber?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not that high up. But to his buds. They didn't like that I
was nosin' around. So they said, `Come on, man, we know where your
friends jumped from. We can show it to you from the plane. We can
say a prayer for them.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you went with them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, what an idiot, huh? Man, the pain's goin' away, but I'm
feelin' pretty sleepy. Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hang on, Thomas. Why did you jump?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot was next to me and this big guy behind me. When we
got up there, everything changed. Said I wasn't worthy to follow
Glaber into a new world. Said I wasn't strong enough to do what had
to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Had to be done?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah. On New Year's Eve. These people are wacked, man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What had to be done, Thomas?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out what it was, and that they probably killed
those people because they didn't want to do it. They were scarin'
me, man. So when I looked down and saw the Dome. I can't believe I
jumped, man. Oh man, when they told me what they were going to do
... I've got to sleep man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they were going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``On New Year's Eve....'' He was breathing heavy now, about to
fall off into a painless sleep induced by his medications.
</P>
<P>
   Sam leaned over and shouted. ``What are they going to do,
Thomas? Tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   The police chief turned his head and placed his ear closed to
the young man's lips. Max could hear nothing, but it appeared as if
the man's lips moved.
</P>
<P>
   Sam stood straight and turned to Max, a look of disbelief on his
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you get it? What are they going to do, Sam. Did he tell
you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he told me. He said they're going to blow up the Skyway
Bridge.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max and the police chief rush to the domed
stadium to find a young Watcher has jumped out of a plane and
landed on the stadium roof.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max watched Sam Lockhart and his men spend Christmas Day
emptying out the Conquistador Hotel. Sam called in the FBI, alerted
the National Guard and the Coast Guard, which began an elaborate
search for Glaber's boat.
</P>
<P>
   Every corner and crevice of the pink hotel was inspected, every
shadow illuminated, every Watcher and every tourist interviewed,
and then asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared as if Glaber, his dozen closest followers and the
kidnapped Cassandra ``Angela'' Powers had been teleported to
another galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget to check behind the nearest comet,'' said Max to
Sam sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel came up clean, not even a cache of weapons, no double
secret sub-basement filled with missiles or nerve gas. The search
went on for days, including a small army with metal detectors on
the beach. They pulled up lots of coins, wristwatches, gold chains
and beer cans _ but nothing that could blow up a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The break came Wednesday night, Dec. 29, just two evenings
before the new year and the new millennium. It was Sam Lockhart
himself who figured it out.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the roof of the hotel, in increasingly stormy
weather, he looked down the beach to a place Max had once described
for him: ``A big circle, like a landing pad for hang gliders or
helicopters.'' Detectives told him no one had ever seen anything
landing there. ``Dig it up,'' Sam ordered.
</P>
<P>
   They found six metal containers carrying enough plastic
explosives to do quite enough damage, thank you, to a bridge, or
federal building, or hotel, or police station, or newspaper office,
or nuclear power plant. The bad news was that one container was
empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much is missing?'' asked the chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably enough to fill a boat the size of Glaber's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn him,'' said the chief, one of his strongest expletives.
``And damn this weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather between Christmas and New Year's was apocalyptic _
no one could remember anything quite like it _ with effects more
dramatic and unpredictable than those produced by the Pacific
warming known as El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   Two tropical storms had formed in the Atlantic, with tropical
waves hopscotching east across Mexico and reforming in the Gulf.
Although none of these were yet of hurricane strength,
meteorologists worried about the unpredictability of such storms a
month after the end of the normal tropical storm season.
</P>
<P>
   Max spent New Year's Eve morning with a weather eye on the sky
and on television news reports. Storm warnings were being issued on
both Florida coasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next two days, we're likely to get lots of rain,
wind, lightning, maybe even some tornadoes. You folks living in
low-lying areas pay special attention for locally heavy flooding,
when the tides are high. These patterns are common for us in
September, but never as late as New Year's Eve. Maybe this is
Mother Nature's way of joining the Big Party.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be no big millennium party for Max.
</P>
<P>
   He and Daisy the dog and maybe Violet would be at the condo,
parked cozily in front of the television set, watching the weather
and news of the festivities around the world as the Year 2000 broke
first over the International Dateline and then swept west, time
zone by time zone, until it reached Florida and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Max would also be in constant touch with Kate at the newspaper
for news of her daughter, and with Sam for news about Glaber and
The Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Max, it's Violet. I need to come over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well I need you to come over. And so does Daisy. We wouldn't
want to usher in the new millennium without you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, Max, I'm one of those who believe the new millennium
doesn't begin until Jan. 1, 2001. But why let logic and mathematics
get in the way of a good orgy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Orgy? Could this be my lucky millennium?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play your cards right. But that's not why I called,
Max. I'm working on an important angle on Glaber. I think I know
who he is. I'm waiting for one more piece of information _ an old
obituary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't keep me in suspense, Violet. What have you got?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well I looked for connections between the names Glaber and
Miller, like you suggested, but came up empty. Then I made an
assumption _ that his name might really be William Miller, like he
told you, and that he's really 50 years old, like he told Father
Ralph, and that he's from California _ he said he was from the West
_ because he just sounds like a Californian _ his voice, all that
New Age stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's some funky hunch for a logician.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stick with me, Max, as you like to say. For days I've been
checking birth records, death certificates, old phone books,
microfiche newspaper stories, out of the big California cities: San
Diego, LA, San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Violet, don't make me jump through this phone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I found an oddity, a birth and a death, in San Francisco. In
the same family. On the same day. On New Year's morning, to be
exact, 1950. The father's name was William Miller. The son's name
was Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are telling me that the son was born and the father died.
On New Year's morning. At the exact midpoint of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, not the exact midpoint, but never mind Max. Here's the
kicker. The father threw himself off the Golden Gate Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The wind off the gulf blew gusts that shook the condo. Lightning
flashed like a strobe light. Daisy slithered under the bed and
began to whimper. The lights flickered and went out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violet. We just lost our electricity. How about you? Violet?''
</P>
<P>
   The phone line was dead.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: The police search for Raoul Glaber and his

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The lights were off, the phone was dead, the dog was under the
bed and sheets of rain raged against the windows of the condo. When
the rain subsided intermittently, Max Timlin could see waves
crashing across the rocks of Land's End, over the dunes, over the
sidewalk and into the street.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on the weather radio said that, for now, everyone should
stay put, that the barometric pressure was dropping like a brick
off a skyscraper, that winds were approaching hurricane speed, that
there were reports of fallen trees and power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are at a millennium party, stay where you are. Repeat.
Do not try to get home.''
</P>
<P>
   Max looked at his watch. It was 12:09 a.m. Jan. 1. The Year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, after all this, I missed it. I missed the millennium.''
His cell phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max. Max. Can you hear me? It's Kate. I'm still at the
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any word about Glaber and your daughter?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got a call from the cops. The Coast Guard found
Glaber's boat about two hours ago in a wharf over in the Port of
Tampa. They've arrested six men. The boat was loaded with
explosives. But there is no sign of Glaber and Cassie. Max. What's
going to happen? I'm so scared.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You want me to try to get over there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Max, I'm staying here through the night, just in case a
call comes in. Now that they've found the boat and the explosives,
they can't spend time looking for Cassie. All their attention is on
people threatened by the storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Max heard a noise and thought it was the wind, but realized
someone was pounding on the door. He looked out. He saw Violet's
lovely face, framed by the hood of a yellow rain slicker.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Max helped her out of her wet clothes, and even Daisy
ventured out of hiding for a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting treacherous out there, Max. It almost looks like
the end of the world. Thank God for the sports utility vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Max gave her a good long hug, sat her on the couch and poured
her a glass of cabernet. Violet reached into her little backpack
and pulled out a file folder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, I think I've got the final two pieces of the puzzle. One
e-mail message came in just before the lights went out.''
</P>
<P>
   She showed him an obituary of William Miller, Glaber's father.
It said that Miller was born in 1900, the son of German immigrants,
that he was a college athlete and honor student, that he graduated
first in his class in medical school, and decided to become a
career army officer.
</P>
<P>
   Here it got interesting. Miller rose to the rank of colonel, and
after World War II served as an advisor to the justices conducting
the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal. Miller spoke German, and was
free to interview the Nazi leaders, even as he took their blood
pressure or gave them an aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now we know that Glaber's father happened to have the name
of a famous 19th-century American doomsday prophet, that he met the
perpetrators of the Holocaust up close, and that three years later
he jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one more thing, Max. I had to wait to get this
translated into English. It's a footnote from a German book on the
Nuremberg trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Max read it. It said that after the suicide of Dr. William
Miller, police found a note in his study addressed to his wife, who
was in the hospital giving birth to their first son, Michael.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have seen what I have seen. To have cared for those whose
hearts were pure evil. I'm not worthy to be the father of a son in
such a world. I'll meet you _ and my son _ in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Max read and re-read the words of the suicide note. It was as if
a large black curtain had been pulled back to reveal a giant
tapestry _ on which a grand but terrible story had now fully
unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Raoul Glaber,'' said Max, shaking his head, Violet's hand
on his shoulder. ''Poor Michael Miller. How could he possibly
escape his destiny? The son of a man turned mad by the Holocaust.
To come into the world on New Year's Day, only to have your father
leap to his death. No wonder he wanted to blow up a bridge. Even
his initials. Michael Miller. MM. The Roman numerals for 2,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Violet and Max made sure the doors and windows of the condo were
secure and fell asleep by candlelight, curled up on the couch, her
head against his shoulder. It was a lovely sleep in the storm until
Max awoke to the sound of Daisy's whimpering.
</P>
<P>
   He reached out and patted her with his left hand, and realized
that his right arm was numb, the circulation cut off by the weight
of Violet's sleeping body. He carefully pulled the arm out from
under her and rested her head against a pillow. He stood up, yawned
and rubbed the blood back into his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``What time is it?'' he whispered to Daisy, and looked at his
watch. It was 4:35 a.m. New Year's Day. His mind exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violet, Violet, wake up honey.'' He shook her harder than he
meant to. ``Violet, what time did Michael Miller's father jump off
the bridge? What time? Do you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Violet rolled off the couch and grabbed the materials from the
file, which they had left spread out across the floor. It took only
a minute or two for the fog of Violet's sleep to clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we know that Michael Miller was born at 1:15 a.m. The
news story doesn't give an exact time, but police estimated the
father killed himself less than an hour after the birth of his
son.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So about 2:15 a.m. Pacific Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Violet got the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 5:15 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. What time is it now,
Max?''
</P>
<P>
   ``About 4:45.''
</P>
<P>
   He dashed toward the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you going, Max?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Violet, stay here with Daisy. Try to raise Sam Lockhart and
Kate Banks on the cell phone. I'm headed for the Skyway Bridge.''

   THE STORY SO FAR: Reporter Max Timlin is hired by editor Kate
Banks to investigate a doomsday cult called The Watchers. He learns
that the leader of The Watchers, Raoul Glaber, has a false
identity. He also learns that Glaber's bride-to-be, Angela Powers,
is the daughter of Kate Banks. With the help of Father Ralph, Max
rescues Angela, until she is kidnapped by Glaber's henchmen. A plot
is uncovered to blow up the Skyway Bridge on New Year's Day. Violet
closes in on Glaber's real identity, just as a hurricane bears down
on West Florida.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max had a half-hour, he figured, to reach the top of the Skyway
Bridge, driving his old Mustang through wind and rain of hurricane
force.
</P>
<P>
   Two things worked in his favor: the eerie emptiness of the roads
and the portable rotating police light he had never returned to Sam
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   He stuck the cop light on his dashboard and cruised forward as
fast as the conditions would allow, through water that rose to his
fenders, over downed power lines and around tree limbs and other
detritus of the high winds.
</P>
<P>
   He waved himself past two clueless toll-booth attendants, but
was stopped at a small roadblock on the stretch of highway leading
to the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sorry, sir, the bridge is closed to all traffic. The
winds are way too dangerous. And the lightning. You'd best be
getting home.'' The officer was young and by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a reporter working on a story. The police chief gave me
this light. Call him if you want. My name is Max. Max Timlin.'' The
officer checked his ID.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has anyone driven up there in the last hour?'' asked Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a Highway Patrol trooper. About 15 minutes ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you talk to the driver?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Just waved him through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you call the roadblock on the other side, please, it's an
emergency, to see if he made it across?''
</P>
<P>
   The officer, thoroughly perplexed, went to his car to use his
radio. Max stepped on the gas.
</P>
<P>
   He drove as fast as he could, but winds from the south seemed to
be pushing against his grille like a fleet of trucks. Gusts knocked
the car sideways, blowing water and wind through the tiny spaces of
the ragtop. He fought the steering wheel for control.
</P>
<P>
   As he climbed the bridge, he realized he was flying blind. The
old wipers seemed to make things worse, and he had no time to
fiddle with the defogger. He tried wiping the window clear with his
hand. As the incline took him higher, more than 100 feet above the
sea, closer to 200, the winds strengthened. Blasts of lightning
crashed around him.
</P>
<P>
   Max feared only two things: lightning and high places. This ride
up the roller coaster was as irrational as anything he had ever
done. He hoped _ he prayed _ hands glued to the wheel, that the
Mustang would cruise over the apex of the bridge, safely to the
other side. That he would find nothing.
</P>
<P>
   More lightning, illuminating the top of the bridge and, too
late, the red reflector lights of a black and gold Highway Patrol
car.
</P>
<P>
   Max slammed the brakes, but the Mustang slid at an angle and
crashed into the bigger, heavier vehicle. He climbed out dazed and
unsteady, and the wind knocked him over. He stumbled up but a
lightning bolt hit one of the bridge towers, and the fear of it
drove Max to his belly. He waited a moment, trying to regain his
breath. He tasted blood.
</P>
<P>
   Max looked up. Another flash. And there, maybe 30 yards ahead,
in the middle of the bridge, at the highest point above the water,
stood a man against the edge, his two arms around the figure of a
woman, appearing limp and unconscious. It was Michael Miller _ aka
Raoul Glaber _ prepared now to die for the sins of his father, and
to take Cassie Powers with him.
</P>
<P>
   Max got to his feet and pressed forward, like a man dragging a
300-pound weight. His nemesis stood perfectly still, immune to the
elements, gazing toward the sky as if in prayer. The man looked at
his watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not time to die, Michael. Stop. Stop.'' Max shouted at
the top of his voice, like King Lear railing against the storm.
``Your life isn't done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller turned in complete bewilderment, and then leaned the
young woman in his arms over the edge of the bridge, 200 feet above
the roiling sea. ``You're too late, Max. Unless you want to join
us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Miller. Your suffering is over. You are NOT your
father. Please put her down. Put the girl down. Please. Come with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Max moved closer. Only three steps separated them. Max leapt for
Miller's feet, but missed, knocking the wind out of him. Miller
aimed a vicious kick with a heavy boot to Max's head and landed a
glancing blow. Max couldn't tell if he was seeing more lightning,
or just the electricity in his brain.
</P>
<P>
   Max looked up, helpless. The King of The Watchers had his angel
_ his Angela Powers _ in his hands now and, almost without effort,
pressed her over his head like an Olympic weight lifter hoisting a
broomstick.
</P>
<P>
   Through the storm in his brain, prone and helpless, Max could
hear Miller, repeating over and over: ``Father, forgive me, for I
know not what I do. Father, forgive me. Father, forgive me.''
</P>
<P>
   Max squeezed his eyes shut, so he would not have to see the girl
fly to her death.
</P>
<P>
   Miller screamed, and Max's eyes snapped open to see him fall
backward in pain and confusion, the girl dropping to the pavement
with a sickening thud. Max was dreaming. Or else a dog, a dog like
Daisy, was standing over Miller, growling like a mother protecting
her babies, her jaws locked on his arm. Someone was helping Max to
his feet. ``Violet _ help Cassie.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Max a good minute, and all his strength, to pull Daisy
off the fallen prophet, who rolled in pain on the pavement. Max
looked up to see Violet's white Jeep behind his crumpled Mustang,
and, down the incline, three police cars, their lights barely
visible, their sirens barely audible in the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' he thought. ``It's finally over.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller made a wild dash for the side of the bridge, emitting a
scream of pain and despair that shot Max into action. Just before
Miller went over the edge, Max tackled him from behind, his arms
locked around the Watcher's shoulders. But Miller's momentum and
the demons inside him carried him over _ carried them both over _
the ledge.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Max heard was Violet's scream. And then silence.
And the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max was dead. He had to be. But could you be dead and dreaming
at the same time? Because this was the strangest dream. Even for a
dead man. He dreamed he was lying in a coffin, a pretty comfortable
one, actually. That surprised him.
</P>
<P>
   And Father Ralph was in the room, saying a prayer over him, and
performing the last rites. Behind him, against the wall of the room
_ quite bright for a mortuary _ stood a row of women. One by one,
they filed by, bent over to kiss him, leaving their hot tears on
his cold face.
</P>
<P>
   First was his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have been a lawyer,'' she whispered in his dead
ear. Then Kate Banks, ``Thanks for saving my daughter.'' Then,
Sherry Darling, who snapped a photograph of him in the coffin and
then hugged his lifeless body until it hurt. Then Violet Rose, the
beautiful flower, who kissed him on the lips, with more passion
than anyone had ever kissed him, but, too bad, cause he was dead
now, but if he was really dead how come he was having this certain
feeling that he associated with being very much alive?
</P>
<P>
   It was all over, he thought now in his dream, I can drift off to
a big, big sleep. Just then he heard a scratching, and looked up to
see two brown and black paws, and then the large head of Daisy the
dog, who whimpered, then drooled on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Max was in a coma for two days, and in the hospital for a month.
He broke his wrist, his collarbone and three ribs. His left lung
collapsed. They removed his spleen. While they were at it, a
plastic surgeon came in and lasered the Watcher tattoo off Max's
behind.
</P>
<P>
   There were dozens of strange theories as to how Max survived the
fall from the bridge. The most common was that Miller absorbed most
of the impact, breaking Max's fall. There was science talk about
terminal velocity and the softening effects of water in motion.
Some people spoke of miracles, but Father Ralph discouraged it.
``Good people make their own miracles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not forget the Coast Guard,'' said Samson Lockhart.
``They risked their lives to fish his sorry butt out of the
water.'' The stormy sea had washed up Max's body onto one of the
bumpers designed to protect the bridge from another collision.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of rehab, Max asked Violet to pick him up at St.
Anthony's Hospital on the day of his release. She rolled his
wheelchair to the front entrance, helped him into the Jeep and
drove at twice the speed limit for the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a surprise for you,'' she said, her face fighting to
contain the width of her smile. A lovely ride on a crisp, sunny
February day brought them to the condo, where Kate was waiting to
greet them. She hugged Max, and then wiped the kisses from his face
with her thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the surprise?'' he said goofily.
</P>
<P>
   From around the corner came an amazing site. His Mustang,
looking in mint condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gift from the newspaper. We had it repaired, rebuilt
the engine, top of the line paint job, and magnificently
detailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving the car, with the top down, was Cassie Powers, wearing
reflector sunglasses and a black bikini. It looked like something
out of an old hot-rod magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In the back, proud and pretty, her head tilted back, enjoying
the breeze, was Daisy the dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to drive, Max?'' Cassie got out and embraced him.
Violet hopped in the passenger side, and Max took the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   He looked down at the dashboard and laughed until it hurt. The
odometer had finally crawled over the 100,000-mile mark _ in fact,
seven miles over, to 007.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like the ending of `Goldfinger,''' he said, cruising down
Gulf Boulevard, feeling the joy of a new day.
</P>
<P>
   -0-
 &UR; EPILOGUE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The body of Michael Miller, aka Raoul Glaber, was never
recovered. He is presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Father Ralph Rizzo and James ``Choirboy'' Jones started a
program for former Watchers, and succeeded in directing many
towards community service and productive social action.
</P>
<P>
   Samson Lockhart retired from police work, received many awards
for his contributions, and opened a chain of New Orleans-style
restaurants called Daisy's.
</P>
<P>
   Daisy the Dog appeared with Max Timlin on the cover of Time
magazine, and visited Max at the beach every weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Banks became Max's good friend, drinking buddy and dance
partner. She hired him and teamed him with Sherry Darling to head
up a special investigative team for the Florida Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Cassie Powers was never called ``Angela'' again. Max took a
fatherly interest in her and coached her on the writing of her
memoir, ``Inside the Watchers,'' which became a best seller.
</P>
<P>
   Max wrote a 29-part blockbuster series about The Watchers. It
was titled ``Ain't Done Yet.'' The Pulitzer Prize Board, an
unusually conservative group, granted him a special award by
acclamation, although one editor thought the series was ``a little
long.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm that hit West Florida on New Year's Eve didn't have an
official name, but Max dubbed it Hurricane Millie, short for
millennium, and the nickname stuck forevermore.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether Max ever hooked up with Violet Rose, well, you're
going to have to check in some time down the road with the new
adventures of Max Timlin, because Max and Violet ... well, let's
just say they ain't done yet, either.
</P>

TEXAS SHOP RESTORING HEARSE THAT CARRIED JFK'S BODY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON MCCONAL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALVARADO, Texas _ Trinidad De La Cruz is one of eight people in
the world who can make a Rolls Royce grill.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is what a television commercial said about him a
few years ago. That does make him special when it comes to auto
body work.
</P>
<P>
   And right now, he's engaged in a special job. He is restoring
the Cadillac hearse that carried the casket and body of President
John F. Kennedy from Parkland Hospital in Dallas to Love Field to
be flown to Washington after his assassination in Dallas in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I feel honored to work on this hearse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So does Luis Guerrero, the detail man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to look good. I promise you that. It is going to
look good,'' Guerrero said.
</P>
<P>
   The hearses and limousines the men refinish for sale at Vaughan
Special Automobiles do look good.
</P>
<P>
   Several were parked around the 1903 2-story house where owner
Arrdeen Vaughan lives.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in a white Cadillac hearse that looked like a new
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's a dandy, isn't it,'' said Vaughan. ``We are taking
it to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   He's friendly, and on this day he wore a leather jacket for
protection against a stiff north wind. He's been in this business
since 1961 and sells about 200 hearses and limos a year.
</P>
<P>
   But he'll trade or buy anything. Proof is in his office and
shop, which are full of antique gasoline pumps, cars, clocks and
Cushman Eagle motor scooters.
</P>
<P>
   There sat an old juke box packed with old records. He punched
the button and Boogie Woogie by Tommy Dorsey's band played.
</P>
<P>
   He told about being reared in Hillsboro. His father owned a
garage and sold buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `I don't care what you do when you grow up,
whether it's selling popcorn or car parts. But I want you to make
sure every sack that comes out of your place has `Vaughan' written
on it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   We drank coffee, and then he issued an invitation. ``Well, come
on, let's look at what may be the most famous hearse in the world _
the last one that carried President Kennedy's casket and body,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He bought the hearse along with 50 other cars from a leasing
company about 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in good shape when I got it,'' he said. ``But I didn't
take care of it and let it sit out in the weather, and it got in
pretty bad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   He decided to have his crew rebuild it a few months ago after
his son Michael Vaughan became owner of funeral homes in Donna and
Mercedes in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That country is 98 percent Catholic, and Michael buries many
of them,'' he said. ``And many of those people loved Kennedy. So I
thought, why not give them the chance to make that last ride to the
cemetery in the hearse that carried JFK.''
</P>
<P>
   We had reached the hearse. The headliner, floor and many other
parts are being replaced. De La Cruz has already built new tail
fins.
</P>
<P>
   We looked at the work and smelled the odor of paints and glass
fiber.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we really got on it, we could probably finish it in a
month,'' said Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to call me when the work is completed.

&HT;     NOW WHAT FOR GAYS IN THE MILITARY? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We all knew six years ago, liberals and
conservatives alike, that President Clinton's mushy compromise over
gays in the military was a temporary cop-out to get the subject out
of the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was having trouble getting the armed services to accept
him, let alone openly gay soldiers. He had ducked Vietnam under
fishy circumstances, and veterans were resisting his authority as
commander-in-chief. So he did what politicians always do in a bind
_ he punted.
</P>
<P>
   The president had promised during his 1992 campaign to allow
gays and lesbians to serve their country without discrimination,
whether in the civil service or the military sector. But dire
predictions of disaster from Congress and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
sent him scurrying for cover.
</P>
<P>
   After long negotiations, the result in 1993 was a policy of
``don't ask, don't tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping secrets was to solve the problem, although even children
in grade school quickly learn that denying reality is never a
permanent answer.
</P>
<P>
   So the don't-ask-don't-tell policy is back now as a campaign
issue. It was never going to work, and it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   One immediate political trigger for the current debate was the
conviction last week of an Army private for bludgeoning to death a
fellow soldier who had been taunted for months with anti-gay slurs.
The other was the clear division now evident between the Democratic
and Republican presidential candidates on the subject as the
election contest heats up.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, it was Hillary Clinton who was out in front first.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning for the New York Senate seat before a gay group, she
said the policy wasn't working and that fitness for military
service should not be based on sexual orientation. Later, in
Washington, her husband added that he also thought his own policy
was ``out of whack'' and needed to be ``reviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Defense Secretary William Cohen weighed in, ordering a
review but not committing the Pentagon to any major reform. A
Pentagon spokesman said an investigation will be launched to
evaluate how the services are carrying out the policy, and if they
are bothering at all to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's goal is to assess ``what the climate is'' at bases where
straight soldiers and gays, undetected or suspected, interact.
</P>
<P>
   Under the present policy, recruits are no longer asked their
sexual orientation at induction. Superiors are forbidden to
question their troops about their sex lives or investigate their
private activities. But the services, which have official
guidelines about dealing with gays, have not established formal
training programs to assure that suspected homosexuals are left
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore was quick to jump on the bandwagon too.
He has long supported allowing gays to serve openly in the
military, but in a new
</P>
<P>
   statement he called forcefully for eliminating the
don't-ask-don't-tell policy. It was a tougher public stand than he
had taken before.
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic presidential rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, had
earlier called for a policy change to allow gays to serve openly.
``I won't settle for a policy that discriminates against gays in
the military,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats are in direct disagreement with the two
leading Republican presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a traditionalist opposed to
single-sex marriages and women and men training together in the
military, has refused to appear before a gay Republican group. It
is thus no surprise that he supports the present policy and says
that any change is ``for the military to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Naval Academy graduate and Vietnam
prisoner of war who has the staunchest military credentials of the
presidential field, is firmly opposed to reform in this area as
well. He said he ``absolutely'' supports the don't-ask-don't-tell
rule.
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``it might be appropriate'' to review the policy.
But he criticized the president's timing, suggesting that he
proposed it now only to help his wife's candidacy for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the president should have called in the Joint Chiefs
and proposed a review in an orderly way rather than dropping the
bombshell in a media interview. ``This is the most volatile,
emotional issue probably that we face,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that the military is going to have to bite the
bullet here. If gays volunteer to defend our country and even die
for it, more power to them. The military brass cannot forever
resist cultural change that has been accepted in many parts of the
civilian society.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials initially resisted allowing women serious
roles in the military, and their increasing participation still
rankles some hardliners. But after some horrible examples of
discrimination, the Department of Defense eventually set down firm
rules to give women opportunities similar to those offered men and
to punish mistreatment based on gender. And gradually women are
proving they can fit in and do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Pentagon similarly resisted opportunities for
racial minorities, and they too have proved they can carry military
responsibility well.
</P>
<P>
   It is finally the turn of gays to be treated fairly and given
the chance to prove themselves without harassment. It is time for
the Joint Chiefs and the rest of the military hierarchy to
establish no-nonsense rules that assure the safety and equality of
all those whose service is meritorious and in accord with routine
military discipline.

`CIDER HOUSE' IS PACKED WITH OSCAR-WORTHY PERFORMANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his American films, Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom (``My
Life as a Dog'') has had a marvelous way of finding nobility in
characters who seem, on the surface, unsympathetic or distasteful _
think of the massively obese mother of ``What's Eating Gilbert
Grape'' or the obnoxious salesman hero of ``Once Around.''
</P>
<P>
   In this adaptation of John Irving's best-selling novel, ``The
Cider House Rules,'' Hallstrom finds it with two abortionists and
an incestuous father. It's quite a feat, and quite a movie. Many
will find the subject matter disturbing (and worth more than a
PG-13 rating), but it's clearly one of the holiday season's richest
and most daring movie entries.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted by Irving himself and set in the World War II homefront
in 1943, it's the story of the irascible but dedicated Dr. Wilbur
Larch (Michael Caine, with a coarse American accent) and his
protege, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), an orphan who has grown up in
the orphanage the good doctor runs in rural Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The orphanage is like something off the cover of the Saturday
Evening Post except for one thing: Dr. Larch freely conducts
abortions on the desperate young women who come to him in trouble;
and he's also not only taught Homer how to conduct abortions, but
how to deliver babies with the skill of a seasoned midwife.
</P>
<P>
   From this situation, the film develops into a coming-of-age
drama as the innocent, sheltered Homer _ loving his mentor and his
orphanage but never comfortable with his side duties _ decides to
see the world and goes to live and work on a nearby apple farm,
where he becomes involved in a love affair and several moral
dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
   What the dilemmas teach Homer _ and what the movie is ``about''
_ is the veracity behind Larch's admonition that right and wrong
are often relative, and sometimes life's rules (like the inane
rules Homer finds posted in the migrant apple-pickers quarters, or
cider house) have to be broken in order to ``make things right.''
</P>
<P>
   But what gives the film its complexity and bite, and makes it
considerably more than a single-minded parable, is its cautionary
subplot involving another of Homer's noble father figures: the
leader (Delroy Lindo) of a group of black migrant workers who also
breaks the rules of life but has much less happy results.
</P>
<P>
   As in his three earlier Hollywood films, Hallstrom has wrapped
this all up in an irresistible package that includes a sweepingly
bittersweet Rachel Portman score, gorgeous photography (shot at
several Norman Rockwellish New England locations) and his own
distinctive directorial touch, which that tends to agreeably
alternate blatant sentimentality with hard-edge realism.
</P>
<P>
   The film is packed with impressive performances: Caine, Maguire,
Lindo and Charlize Theron (achingly perfect as Homer's earthy,
confused love interest) should all be Oscar contenders; and Paul
Rudd, Kathy Baker, Jane Alexander, Kate Nelligan, Kiernan Culkin
and Erykah Badu are equally effective in smaller but memorable
parts.
</P>
<P>
   The Cider House Rules. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom. Screenplay
by John Irving. Cast: Tobey Maguire, Michael Caine, Charlize
Theron, Delroy Lindo, Paul Rudd. Miramax. 129 minutes. Rated PG-13
for abortion and incest themes.

`STUART LITTLE' A WELCOME ADDITION TO FAMILY-ORIENTED HOLIDAY FILM
FARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may not be the unqualified crowd-pleaser that the already
phenomenally successful ``Toy Story 2'' has turned out to be, but
``Stuart Little'' _ the second of the holiday movie season's
``family'' affairs _ makes a more than worthy companion piece.
</P>
<P>
   It goes the distance in trying to be a completely faithful movie
equivalent of a classic children's book (by E.B. White, a best
seller for more than 50 years), its computer-generated special
effects are amusing and effective, and its overall charm translates
well to adults.
</P>
<P>
   The story is about the Littles (Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie), a
New York couple who decide to adopt a brother for their only son
(Jonathan Lipnicki), but somehow return from the orphanage with a
child from another species. In fact, a mouse _ Stuart (voice of
Michael J. Fox).
</P>
<P>
   The movie deals with the problems that arise as Stuart's new
brother refuses to accept him, the family cat (voice of Nathan
Lane) wants to have him for lunch, and Stuart himself begins to
feel an ``empty space'' in his heart and longs for his real
parents.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Rob Minkoff (a Disney veteran who co-directed
``The Lion King''), the wonder of the movie is that, like so many
of the great children's stories, it takes a single fantasy
absurdity (a humanoid mouse) and plops it right down into an
otherwise real world, and makes it more or less work.
</P>
<P>
   If the film has a drawback, it is that we never quite fully
accept this improbability on the screen in the same way we can on
paper or even within the total fantasy environment of a cartoon, so
its story can never quite grab the audience on an emotional level.
It's enormously cute, but it doesn't allow us to ever completely
suspend our disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the character of Stuart is endearing, the production
design is splendidly stylized to reflect the illustrations of a
children's book, the script (co-written by M. Night Shyamalan, the
director of ``The Sixth Sense'') has some clever twists, and the
effects _ by John Dykstra (the original ``Star Wars'') are quite
arresting.
</P>
<P>
   By far, the best of these effects are the ones that humanize the
numerous cat characters _ the villains of the piece _ by taking
real cats and computer-generating lip movements and human facial
expressions. This technology has been used a lot recently (in
commercials and films such as ``Dr. Doolittle''), but here it seems
to have reached a pinnacle of perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Little. Directed by Rob Minkoff. Screenplay by M. Night
Shyamalan and Greg Brooker. Cast: Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie,
Jonathan Lipnicki, with the voices of Michael J. Fox, Nathan Lane
and Steve Zahn. Columbia. 92 minutes. Rated PG for a few flatulence
jokes.

<P>
   ON THE EVE OF THE MILLENNIUM, Americans are concentrating on
their own families and are relatively less involved with their
communities outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   A large majority of the public believes it's critical to have
the power to stand up for oneself and be able to communicate one's
feelings. Being a good neighbor is given more priority than
community involvement or having a lot of friends. And having
children is deemed more important than being married.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to good economic times, there is a general feeling of
optimism about the future for most Americans. That optimism,
however, is joined by considerable concern about the morals of this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Peace and quiet _ time for onesself _ is seen as in short supply
these days. Getting time for oneself is an important wish for the
future.

<P>
   ON THE EVE OF THE MILLENNIUM, Americans are concentrating on
their own families and are relatively less involved with their
communities outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   A large majority of the public believes it's critical to have
the power to stand up for oneself and be able to communicate one's
feelings. Being a good neighbor is given more priority than
community involvement or having a lot of friends. And having
children is deemed more important than being married.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to good economic times, there is a general feeling of
optimism about the future for most Americans. That optimism,
however, is joined by considerable concern about the morals of this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Peace and quiet _ time for onesself _ is seen as in short supply
these days. Getting time for oneself is an important wish for the
future.

   __ ABOUT the SURVEY: The New York Times Millennium Poll was
conducted by the News Surveys department of The New York Times. It
was designed by MARJORIE CONNELLY, staff editor, under the
direction of MICHAEL KAGAY, head of the department. A total of
1,178 adult Americans were interviewed by telephone between July 17
and July 19, 1999. The sampling error in the poll could account for
variations of plus or minus 3 percentage points in major findings.

`ANNA AND THE KING': WHAT? NO SINGING? IS A PUZZLEMENT! 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If any movie could be said to be haunted (maybe cursed is a
better word) by another movie, it is Andy Tennant's picturesque but
stodgy ``Anna and the King.'' The film that does the haunting (and
the cursing) is the 1956 film adaptation of Rodgers and
Hammerstein's classic Broadway musical ``The King and I,'' based on
the same material.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Tennant's film, which stars Jodie Foster and Chow
Yun-Fat in roles played in the earlier movie by Deborah Kerr and
Yul Brynner, you keep expecting the characters to burst into song,
but they never do. And because the mostly solemn dramatic tone of
``Anna and the King'' is so similar to that of ``The King and I,''
the absence of songs comes as a letdown. Especially missed when
their moments arrive are ``Getting to Know You,'' ``A Puzzlement''
and above all ``Shall We Dance?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it's unfair to ask ``Anna and the King'' to be
anything but what it is. But ``The King and I'' has become so
deeply embedded in our culture that its version of the true story
that inspired Margaret Landon's book ``Anna and the King of Siam''
supersedes all others in much the same way that ``My Fair Lady''
now looms over Shaw's ``Pygmalion.'' (Before ``The King and I,''
Langdon's work had been adapted into a popular nonmusical 1946
movie starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison.)
</P>
<P>
   What the new film offers in place of songs is lush local color
(the film was shot in Malaysia), grand palaces, dazzling pageantry,
one heated battle scene, and a much more enlightened,
multiculturally sensitive perspective on world affairs than the
view offered by the musical. Here the British (with the exception
of Anna) are painted as greedy double-dealing industrial merchants
deviously promoting a 19th-century version of globalization. Anna
ultimately finds herself pulled between her loyalty to Britain and
her pained awareness of her countrymen's racism and deceitfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' is also a misstep for the gifted Ms.
Foster, an actress who seems more interested these days in
sanctifying herself as an old-fashioned heroine than in taking on
dramatically risky roles. Adopting a tentative British accent, she
plays the title character as a virtuous, nobler-than-thou ice queen
and seems even chillier here than she did in ``Contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Foster's late-'90s screen personality often suggests that
she is aspiring to fill the shoes of the '60s Julie Andrews in
spreading high-minded sweetness and light. But she lacks Ms.
Andrews' vigor and down-to-earth sense of fun, and even when being
playful she emits a certain guardedness, her sharp blue eyes
scrutinizing the surroundings for signs of trouble. Three decades
ago Ms. Andrews may have been mocked as embodying a reactionary
ickiness, but no one accused her of being thin-blooded.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Foster's character, Anna Leonowens, a British widow who
traveled to Bangkok in 1862 with her young son to be schoolteacher
to the 58 children of King Mongkut, was among other things a
spirited pioneer taking enormous chances. But Ms. Foster's Anna
hardly seems to have a body. Whatever lust for adventure drove the
character to make that journey is barely apparent in Ms. Foster's
demure, wary performance.
</P>
<P>
   Chow's imperious, polygamous King inevitably begs comparison
with Brynner's. Although this Hong Kong superstar lends the king an
imposing authority (mitigated by moments of softness), his
performance lacks Brynner's terrifying thunder. His carefully
shaded performance may be many things, but it is never truly scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' has the rambling pace of an episodic 1950s
costume drama. As Anna and her cheeky young son, Louis (Tom
Felton), adjust to their new life in Southeast Asia, there are the
inevitable collisions between Siamese and British ways of thinking.
Among the many little dramas that unfold, the most significant
involves Tuptim (Bai Ling), the king's newest wife, who refuses to
be parted from her lover and flees the palace to join him in a
Buddhist monastery.
</P>
<P>
   Later the focus shifts to regional politics and an attempted
coup by the rebellious General Alak (Randall Duk Kim). Siamese
politics and military strategy might be described in these scenes
as the art of the high-stakes bluff.
</P>
<P>
   In evoking the undeclared, unconsummated love between Anna and
the king, the movie is as prim and tight-lipped as its 
lady. And although Chow can be charming, even charismatic, he lacks
Brynner's swashbuckling sensual magnetism. Without any real sparks
between the main characters, ``Anna and the King'' unfolds like an
exotic historical diorama with dramatic vignettes thrown in for
spice.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Anna and the King'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It has scenes of people who have been tortured and one
execution.
</P>

`MAGNOLIA': TWISTS OF FATE IN L.A. LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c .1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great uh-oh moment in Paul Thomas Anderson's ``Magnolia''
occurs about two-thirds of the way through this artfully
orchestrated symphony of L.A. stories. A song bursts out: it is
heard first from one character, then from another, until all the
film's assorted lost souls are brought together by a single
anxiety-ridden refrain. ``It's not ... going to stop,'' each one
sings resignedly, signaling the approach of an impending group
meltdown. But the effect is less that of a collective shiver than
of directorial desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point, the colossally talented Anderson has seemed
bound for glory. He has set up another Altmanesque swirl of
intersecting stories, much as he did in ``Boogie Nights,'' with
many of the same cast members again assembled to form a charismatic
ensemble. He has glided the film gracefully among seemingly
unrelated episodes, keeping the viewer eager for all the pieces to
fall into place. And he has begun the film with a paean to
outrageously wild twists of fate, so that his own film's whopper
coincidences won't seem too much of a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   And to the same ``Nashville'' echoes that reverberated through
``Boogie Nights,'' he now adds a potent touch of ``Network.'' In
the San Fernando Valley, on the verge of the new millennium, the
effects of media poisoning are powerfully felt. From the dying
television mogul (Jason Robards) to the schoolboy quiz show star
who can't take any more pressure (Jeremy Blackman), virtually
everyone in the film is a casualty of pop cultural malaise in some
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The present day, seen as if from a great distance, appears to
have brought the dire warnings of the ``Network'' madman Howard
Beale to fruition. Stepping into the ``Network'' role of
soothsayer, Anderson leaves himself poised to wonder what's next.
</P>
<P>
   But when that group sing-along arrives, ``Magnolia'' begins to
self-destruct spectacularly. It's astonishing to see a film begin
this brilliantly only to torpedo itself in its final hour. All
along, Anderson has leapt from episode to episode as if working
under the spell of some larger vision. But as the desperate reach
for some larger meaning begins, the sheer arbitrariness of his
approach is laid bare. So bare, in fact, that when ``Magnolia''
finally does come in for what is quite literally an amphibious
landing, it actually invokes a biblical plague to create a sense of
resolution. Even in the Bible, that kind of maneuver was a last
resort.
</P>
<P>
   Named for, among other things, a thoroughfare in Anderson's
native San Fernando Valley, and conceived with a many-petaled
structure, ``Magnolia'' is still too good to be missed. What
Anderson lacks in substance is offset by his great skill with
actors, his gift for shaping resonant little individual vignettes
and his extraordinary intuition. Treated in linear fashion, the
events and relationships here would not add up to much. But
scrambled and rearranged as a haunting collage, they take on
greater power.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, ``Magnolia'' is a showcase for some splendid
acting. Its single biggest surprise is Tom Cruise in the role of a
strutting, obscenity-spouting cult figure named Frank Mackey.
Frank's brand of celebrity as a macho self-help guru is seen as
symptomatic of the film's time and place. First seen in
performance, on a kind of rock-star high, Frank is later made to
unravel during a lengthy interview sequence (with April Grace) that
is one of the film's incisive highlights.
</P>
<P>
   With a keen sense of the nuances and power plays involved here,
Anderson creates a sustained trial by fire for Frank and shows how
each of the film's initially secure-seeming characters is actually
so vulnerable and needy. Cruise, like the other actors here, is
allowed to come on like gangbusters and then reveal hidden
uncertainty until, in that lethal last hour, the film's startlingly
vapid insights lead him off a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who uses Aimee Mann's songs on the soundtrack to
excellent effect, has acknowledged drawing inspiration for the
film's mood and structure from Beatles music (with pervasive,
brewing mood changes that share the unsettling spirit of ``A Day in
the Life''). Thus he often seems to be conducting the ways in which
characters meet and intersect.
</P>
<P>
   It is gradually revealed, for instance, that the film includes
not only its young quiz show star but a former boy wonder (William
H. Macy) who is now a sad has-been. And that two of the story's
older men ( Robards and Philip Baker Hall) are powerful figures in
the television industry who have serious illnesses and bitterly
estranged children. Julianne Moore wafts luminously through the
film as the grieving wife of one of them, a figure of showy
materialism with no inner resources at all. ``Magnolia'' is saved
from its own worst, most reductive ideas by the intimacy of the
performances and the deeply felt distress signals given off by the
cast.
</P>
<P>
   Also extremely memorable here are two other members of
Anderson's evolving stock company, Philip Seymour Hoffman as a
dying man's devoted nurse and caretaker and John C. Reilly as an
equally compassionate policeman. In each of them there is the
mixture of creeping despair and saving grace that are the best
``Magnolia'' has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Magnolia'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes strong profanity and graphic
sexual references.

`STUART LITTLE': EXTRA! SLY CAT UPSTAGES STUART LITTLE! 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The plucky title character of ``Stuart Little'' may be an
adorable three-inch-tall digital mouse, but the scene stealer in
this delightful screen adaptation of E.B. White's classic
children's book is Stuart's feline nemesis, Snowbell. A white
Chinchilla Persian cat played by five nearly identical felines and
voiced by Nathan Lane in a sly, streetwise New York accent tinged
with hauteur, Snowbell is one of the most fully rounded nonhuman
characters to appear in a family film in quite some time. Every
imperious toss of Snowbell's head and twitch of his petulantly
bowed mouth synchronizes so smoothly with Lane's dialogue that at
times he seems remarkably close to being like a real-life talking
cat.
</P>
<P>
   When Stuart (Michael J. Fox, sounding indefatigably perky and
upbeat) is adopted by the Little family and goes to live with them
in their cozy Manhattan brownstone, Snowbell is outraged that a
mouse should have the status of a family member. Jealous and
resentful, he longs to pounce on the new arrival and devour him.
And because he is a pampered house cat, he is also mortified at the
prospect of becoming a laughing stock among his neighborhood
cronies should they discover he is ``a cat owned by a mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the devious scheme Snowbell contrives to get rid of Stuart, a
pair of mice posing as Stuart's biological parents call on the
Littles to claim their son and take him off to their dingy home in
faraway Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little'' sustains a lovely balance between enchantment
and playfulness as it follows Stuart's travels from orphanage, to
Manhattan brownstone, to Brooklyn and back to the Littles. It is
especially witty in portraying the difficult adjustments Stuart
must make in settling comfortably into a human-scale world. One
morning, Stuart nearly drowns when he is accidentally tossed into a
washing machine. He also has problems bonding with his new parents'
human son, George (Jonathan Lipnicki), who was hoping for a
playmate of his own species and size. The two eventually find
common ground when Stuart enters the miniature mouse-size world of
George's electric train set.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie's most euphoric moment, the boy and the mouse
collaborate in a toy boat race in Central Park that begins as a
disaster but turns into an unlikely triumph as Stuart pilots the
vessel to victory, navigating the alarmingly choppy waters and
resisting the aggressive collisions of competing boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little,'' directed by Rob Minkoff from a screenplay by
M. Night Shyamalan and Greg Brooker, blends images of the real New
York City with an impressionistic storybook version that captures
some of the original book's enchanted mid-1940s ambiance. That
period feeling is enhanced by the look and demeanor of Mr. and Mrs.
Little. As played by Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis, they embody a
young child's-eye view of parents as benign but mysterious figures
who inhabit another world.
</P>
<P>
   In the last third of the movie, the conscience-stricken
impostors confess their hoax to Stuart and send him back to
Manhattan in the toy roadster George gave him. But will Stuart make
it home safely or will Snowbell and his alley cat co-conspirators
intercept him? When Stuart gets lost in Central Park and is stalked
by several hungry cats who plan to divide him up into portions, the
magical city becomes a shadowy nightmarish jungle that is spooky
but not too frightening for young children.
</P>
<P>
   The only element that doesn't completely harmonize with the rest
of the film is the visually unremarkable digital figure of Stuart.
In a movie where everything else is a surreal storybook version of
the commonplace, the character often appears too cartoonish for his
environment. Of course, for many children, who will be charmed by
this fable about learning how to fit in while standing up for
yourself, Stuart's very otherness will be taken as proof that he,
like every child who identifies with him, is special.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Stuart Little'' is rated PG (Parental guidance
suggested). Some young children might be frightened by scenes in
which Stuart's life is in danger.

`BICENTENNIAL MAN' PLAYS LIKE FAITHFUL TESTIMONIAL TO SCI-FI'S
GOLDEN AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Columbus seems an unlikely candidate for the honor, but
his new movie, ``Bicentennial Man,'' represents one of Hollywood's
rare excursions into the realm of ``classic'' science fiction _ so
unsullied by the normal sci-fi movie conventions that it might have
been lifted from the pages of ``Galaxy'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   It's far from completely successful, and is sure to disappoint
much of its audience _ both sci-fi purists who will object to Robin
Williams' shtick, and mainstream movie fans who will go in
expecting another riotous masquerade comedy on the order of
Columbus' earlier collaboration with Williams, ``Mrs. Doubtfire.''
</P>
<P>
   But it has an interesting and rather outrageous premise, which
it follows faithfully to a logical end. It's a movie centered on an
idea, and since the sci-fi movie genre has tended to avoid ideas
whenever possible in favor of formula, shoot-em-up action and
monster pieces, it's definitely something different.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a short story (which was later expanded into a novel)
by Isaac Asimov, it's the parable of Andrew (Robin Williams, in a
kind of streamlined-moderne, ``Wizard of Oz'' tin-man outfit), an
android designed to be a domestic servant who enters the service of
a wealthy San Francisco family in the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
   It quickly turns out that Andrew is not just a machine but a
mutant machine _ the one robot in his line that has curiosity,
judgment and a creative flair that soon has him bonding with
several of the family members (Sam Neill and Embeth Davidtz),
carving models out of wood and making elaborate clocks that become
a flourishing business.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the movie rapidly jumps through the succeeding years
and decades and centuries as Andrew stays close to the family and
their descendants, continually upgrades himself with each new
generation of advances in computer and artificial intelligence
technology, and becomes more and more human.
</P>
<P>
   The idea it follows is the theory that artificially created
intelligence will, by design or mutation, inevitably take on
increasingly human traits (while humans increasingly repair
themselves with bionic parts) until, at some point, it will be
increasingly hard to tell the difference between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with Columbus (``Home Alone'') at the helm, this idea
is explored with plenty of scenes of both cute and nasty children,
much family bickering and flatulence jokes (his specialty). And
it's structured to contain a string of sight gags and showcase what
appear to be the usual extemporaneous Williams one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Bicentennial Man'' increasingly loses even these
commercial considerations and gets bolder and more interesting as
it sweeps through time, and finally becomes a somber, sentimental
and rather profound romantic fantasy that is more true to the
spirit of the Golden Age of science-fiction writing than possibly
any other movie of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Bicentennial Man. Directed by Chris Columbus. Screenplay by
Nicholas Kazan. Cast: Robin Williams, Embeth Davidtz, Sam Neill,
Oliver Platt. Disney/Touchstone. 130 minutes. Rated PG for language
and some sexual content.

   Grade: B

`THE EMPEROR AND THE ASSASSIN': A BLOODTHIRSTY UNIFICATION OF
CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a measure of Hollywood's global reach that Chen Kaige's
historical epic ``The Emperor and the Assassin,'' reputed to be the
most expensive Asian film ever produced, should closely resemble
one of Cecil B. DeMille's grandiose cinematic circuses.
</P>
<P>
   In its blend of pomp, suds, swashbuckling action and moralizing
(about the price of power and imperial ambition), the movie conveys
the sweep of history with a capital H.
</P>
<P>
   The story revolves around Ying Zheng (Li Xuejian), the ruthless
third-century B.C. ruler who became China's first emperor after
conquering and forcibly unifying the country's seven kingdoms. That
conquest, achieved only through a staggering loss of life, proved
tenuous. An epilogue informs us that Ying Zheng's dream of a united
China lasted only 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to draw your own conclusions about whether the story
is a disguised parable about the failed ambitions of Mao Zedong's
Cultural Revolution. Even if it isn't, the movie addresses issues
that haunt Chinese history to this day, about the value of the
individual in the world's most populous country, not to mention the
age-old question of ends justifying means.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Chen's last two films, the modern historical epic
``Farewell, My Concubine'' and the gorgeously chilly, opium-hazed
``Temptress Moon,'' ``The Emperor and the Assassin'' clanks along
in a relatively conventional way.
</P>
<P>
   As its blood-soaked narrative skein of back-stabbing imperial
politics, murderous betrayals and mass slaughter marches forward,
the characters are somewhat dwarfed by the scenery and by stunning
battle sequences that are awesome even by Hollywood's blockbuster
standards.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene of mass slaughter, a large rebel army is caught by
surprise in front of the emperor's palace, surrounded and
methodically mowed down by an opposing army of royal archers who
leave behind a staggering pile of carnage. In another, scores of
children from a city under siege leap off the battlements of the
castle in which they've been imprisoned. Those who survive the jump
are later discovered to have been buried alive.
</P>
<P>
   As for the accuracy of historical events depicted, it is
probably not much greater than in one of Shakespeare's history
plays. Another recent movie, Zhou Xiaowen's ``The Emperor's
Shadow,'' released here last year, surrounded the same emperor with
an entirely different set of schemers, power brokers and
hangers-on.
</P>
<P>
   In this version, the two principal characters are the ruthless
emperor and his lover (and childhood playmate and brilliant
strategic ally), Lady Zhao (the great Chinese actress Gong Li). By
the end of the movie, the emperor has betrayed her so completely
that he is left standing alone and friendless in the mess he has
made, rather like a third-century B.C. Michael Corleone.
</P>
<P>
   It is Lady Zhao who concocts a devious plan to unite the
populace behind the emperor by arranging a bogus assassination
attempt that will justify his invasion of the neighboring kingdom
of Yan.
</P>
<P>
   The climactic showdown with Jing Ke (Zhang Fengyi), the fearless
professional killer she recruits for the job (and with whom she
falls deeply in love) takes place at an ambassadorial ceremony
where he appears in disguise and presents Ying Zheng with a box
containing the severed head of an enemy general and a map with a
concealed sword.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Emperor and the Assassin'' story is crammed with enough
melodrama to fill several soap operas. What sends Ying Zheng
tumbling down a slippery moral slope from imperial idealist to
bloodthirsty despot is his discovery about his parentage, which
drives him to murder anyone with knowledge of the truth.
</P>
<P>
   His mounting desperation eventually drives him to break his vow
to Lady Zhao that he will not invade her homeland. That broken
promise is the ultimate betrayal to the only person he can trust.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the film's treacherous characters, the most vivid is
Changxin (Wang Zhiwen), a wily, androgynous-looking marquis who
plays the clown to Ying Zheng and is the queen mother's lover as
well as her servant. His glittering false smiles and air of
frivolity conceal the heart of a traitor and go-for-broke rebel
leader. In the high-stakes imperial politics of ``The Emperor and
the Assassin,'' every appearance is a deception. &QL;

   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico, one of Latin America's most influential
countries, is welcoming the new millennium with the same clash of
cultures its lived with for 500 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church is inviting its faithful to attend Mass for
a night of prayer and devotion to Jesus Christ, born 2000 years ago
in a land the original Mexicans didn't know existed until the
1500s.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City is holding a daylong party to celebrate Mexico's
``diversity,'' with a parade, dancing and music along its main
Paseo de la Reforma boulevard and in the city's gigantic main
square. Acapulco, Puerto Vallarta and other resort cities that are
selling inflated hotel packages for New Year's Eve are also
promising public entertainment and big fireworks shows.
</P>
<P>
   For those who wish to commune with their indigenous ancestors,
rock promoters here are putting on a New Age musical and dance
extravaganza next to Mexico's ancient Teotihuacan pyramids north of
the capital city. The pyramids, which rival those of Egypt in bulk,
were begun in 100 A.D., making them almost as old as Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The civilization in the area stretches back to 400 years before
Christ _ a reminder that ancient Mexico was home to cities that
were more sophisticated than most European urban centers during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   With the pyramids of the Sun and the Moon looming behind them,
Mexico's folklore ballet is scheduled to perform on New Year's Eve
at Teotihuacan along with Indian dancers, mariachi bands and
marimba groups.
</P>
<P>
   The rock line-up is ambitious. In addition to several famous
Mexican bands that are confirmed to perform, promoters are still
trying to get at least two of the following acts: rocker Peter
Gabriel, the Pretenders, and English early 70's bands like Jethro
Tull, King Crimson, Yes or the Moody Blues.
</P>
<P>
   None of the big international acts is confirmed yet, but
promoters are putting a positive spin on the event, which is called
the ``Last Night of the Millennium'' and is expensive by Mexican
standards. Tickets are the equivalent of more than US$40 tickets in
advance or US$75 at the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people care if they see Peter Gabriel or the
Moody Blues,'' said Carlos Barba, an assistant to the directors of
Rockotitlan, the Mexican company putting on the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is this is going to be at Teotihuacan,''
Barba said. ``We're the first to have obtained permits to put on a
show there.''
</P>
<P>
   Teotihuacan, which means ``the place of Gods,'' had already been
abandoned for more than 700 years by the time the Spanish
conquistadors marched into Mexico in the early 1500s. At its peak,
the complex of ceremonial pyramids and other structures was home to
between 100,000 and 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The sound system for the ``Last Night of the Millennium'' will
be designed for an audience of 200,000, according to the promoters.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City's bash is going to be a ``party of citizenship
participation,'' said Alejandro Aura, director of the city's
Culture Institute. Residents of all the city's boroughs have been
invited to make floats for a parade, and disposable cameras will be
handed out around the city so people can record their version of
the last night of this century, Aura said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is different than just offering entertainment to a
passive public,'' Aura added.
</P>
<P>
   But along the city's Paseo de la Reforma, dancers and musicians
will play into the dawn of Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment will be diverse and will celebrate Mexicans'
various European and indigenous roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think a show by conchero dancers (Indian dancers who wear
walnut shells on their ankles) is as valid as a show by a string
quartet,'' Aura said.
</P>
<P>
   In the city's main square, four giant screens will transmit
celebrations from around the world as the new millennium begins to
gradually dawn. A huge fireworks display is planned, along with a
mariachi band singing the traditional Mexican birthday song, ``Las
Mananitas.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Pacific coast city of Puerto Vallarta, the city is
inviting celebrants to wear white to mark a peaceful change of the
century. Hotels and restaurants are also trying to sell inflated
hotel packages demanding four- or five-day stays at double or
triple normal room rates.
</P>
<P>
   Air fares to resorts have soared, too. Even flights to
industrial towns that are near resorts are double the price now. A
short flight from Mexico City to the Pacific coast city of Lazaro
Cardenas, for example, costs about $400 instead of less than $200.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent feature of Lazaro Cardenas is its oil
refinery. But it is also less than two hours away from Ixtapa, one
of Mexico's prime beach resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents are reporting that air fares and hotel rates may
start to drop as Dec. 31 draws closer and many hotels still have
vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Sanchez, a 32-year-old Mexico City computer programmer,
said he's bucking all the hype over the new millennium and planning
to go the traditional route. He'll toast the New Year with his
family and attend Mass at his church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a special Mass with a message of hope
for renewing our faith,'' Sanchez said. ``The beginning of the new
millennium doesn't mean much change for us. I think that all the
publicity on the part of different organizations and businesses is
contaminating us and forcing us to think we have to do something
different at this year's end.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernabe Zamora, a 20-year-old college student said he'll be
going to church, too, if just to please his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great. I'm witnessing the change of one
millennium to another,'' Zamora said. ``But the reality is the
situation in our country isn't going to change simply because of
the magical change of a clock.''

   Q-TIP: ``Amplified'' (Arista).
</P>
<P>
   Tribe Called Quest disbanded last year, but its great insight
lingers on with Q-Tip's ``Amplified,'' the first solo album by a
Tribe member. Where hip-hop is saturated with booming bass lines
and larger-than-life voices, Q-Tip defies both mandates to breeze
through the din.
</P>
<P>
   The tracks on ``Amplified,'' produced by Q-Tip and Jay Dee, pare
bass lines to clipped syncopations, and Q-Tip raps without rushing
or raising his voice. Although Busta Rhymes and a self-parodying
Korn show up at the end of the album, most of ``Amplified'' is
Q-Tip on his own or with the women he's sweet-talking.
</P>
<P>
   He's secure in his boasts and playful in his seductions, and the
syncopations of his monotone are as much percussion as speech. With
electronic blips, tersely swinging drumbeats, two-chord vamps and
tightly rationed doses of melody, ``Amplified'' turns weightless,
transparent rhythms into hypnosis. &QL;

`ANNA' DOESN'T COMPARE AS WELL TO OLDER VERSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood just can't seem to get enough of the story of Anna
Leonowens and her friendship with the King of Siam. It's given us
the 1946 ``Anna and the King of Siam,'' the 1956 version of Rogers
and Hammerstein's immortal Broadway musical, ``The King and I''
(both multi-Oscar-winners), and a short-lived 1972 TV series.
</P>
<P>
   This year, we've had a watered-down, animated version of ``The
King and I'' aimed at children (with half the R&AMP;H songs missing);
and now, only a few months later, ``Anna and the King,'' a splashy
new, non-musical version (ostensibly based on a ``new'' source,
Leonowens' journal) starring Jodie Foster as Anna and Chow Yun-Fat
as the King.
</P>
<P>
   This latest _ and at 140 minutes, longest _ version of the tale
definitely has its moments, and looks so stunning that it works on
the level of an historical epic. In most other ways, however, it
pales in comparison to its two classic predecessors, and also just
generally feels like one too many trips to the well.
</P>
<P>
   The script follows the basic story beats of '46 and '56
versions: Anna, a spunky British widow comes to Bangkok in 1862 to
tutor the numerous children of King Rama IV, they butt heads but
gradually come to appreciate and learn valuable lessons from one
another, and she helps him keep Siam free from European domination.
</P>
<P>
   But in this take, the conflict between the pair is toned way
down (Chow's King is a much kinder, gentler fellow than the
swaggering bully created by Rex Harrison and Yul Brynner), they
seem to adore each other from first sight, and much of the inherent
comedy _ and charm _ generated by all the sparks is lost.
</P>
<P>
   By far the best thing about this new production is its visuals,
with gorgeous cinematography (by Caleb Deschanel), convincing
computer-generated backgrounds of 19th century Bangkok, and the
movie year's most impressive set _ a sumptuously detailed
recreation of Bangkok's Grand Palace, built in Malaysia after the
Thais refused permission to film in the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Director Andy Tennant (``Fools Rush In,'' ``Ever After'') and
his writers, Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes (``Star Trek IV''),
also aim rather high, spending much screen time on the intricate
politics of the story, and refusing to dumb-down the King's complex
situation and threats both internal (from Siamese rebels) and
external (from the European powers).
</P>
<P>
   But by writing in so many conspiracy and battle scenes, it
almost ceases to be a character-driven romantic comedy, to become
more of an action spectacular. Surprisingly, given Tennant's thirst
for authenticity, the film also works to a strangely bogus climax
that seems clumsily designed to give Jodie Foster a big moment as
an action heroine.
</P>
<P>
   As the King, Hong Kong's Chow Yun-Fat makes a powerful and
stately presence, and _ if not quite the star turn of Yul Brynner
in his prime _ he at least does his own elegant and enjoyable
interpretation. Be warned, however, that due either to his accent
or poor sound recording, about half of his dialogue is
unintelligible.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Foster also does her best, and gives her usual intense and
heart-felt performance, but the part requires the movie-star
sparkle of an Irene Dunne or the aristocratic charm of a Deborah
Kerr. In comparison to either of these two earlier Annas, her
performance here seems self-conscious and rather dull.
</P>
<P>
   Anna and the King. Directed by Andy Tennant. Screenplay by Steve
Meerson and Peter Krikes. Cast: Jodie Foster, Chow Yun-Fat, Bai
Ling. 20th Century-Fox. 140 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence.

`BICENTENNIAL MAN': SO HARD ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT SUCH A SOFTY
WITHIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Receiving a gushy cinematic Christmas card from Robin Williams
has become almost an annual rite of commerce. But in trying to be
all things to all people, ``Bicentennial Man'' easily takes the
cake as the star's most grandiose holiday greeting yet.
</P>
<P>
   This feel-good millennial allegory, adapted from an Isaac Asimov
story (and a novel by Asimov and Robert Silverberg), is directed by
Chris Columbus, the pull-every-heartstring maestro behind ``Mrs.
Doubtfire.'' It follows the 200-year life (beginning in the year
2005) of a robot who yearns to be human and over two centuries
metamorphoses from machine into man. By the end of the movie, the
robot, named Andrew, has shed his metallic shell, acquired a
central nervous system and turned into Robin Williams, the
misty-eyed, empathetic smiling-through-tears sad clown and
shameless ham we all know.
</P>
<P>
   Like other recent Robin Williams products, this one wants to
tickle our funny bones while going for the emotional jugular with
drippy, sugar-coated New Age sentiments that echo ``What Dreams May
Come,'' ``City of Angels'' and other recent films that have
pretended to be touched by angels. The difference between
``Bicentennial Man'' and those movies is that this time the hokum
isn't all spiritualist mumbo jumbo. The possibility of a machine
(or a ``household appliance'' as Andrew's manufacturer
contemptuously describes him) claiming to have human qualities
seems increasingly likely. What's not so likely is that a robot, in
seeking to be human, would embrace mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bicentennial Man'' tosses around some ideas about the
relationship between humans and machines, and it has some good
jokes (the early Andrew trying and failing to grasp the essence of
humor) and many clever sight gags. Its wittiest character is a
feisty, hip-swinging robot named Galatea (Kiersten Warren) equipped
with a personality chip that makes her sashay to Aretha Franklin's
``Respect.''
</P>
<P>
   But in zigzagging between low comedy and high sentiment, the
movie never settles into a comfortable narrative track. As it takes
huge, awkward leaps forward in time, we don't feel as though we're
being given glimpses into the future so much as revisiting a
standard ``Star Trek''-style fantasy of topless towers and whizzing
little airships. And as the movie keeps jumping forward, its
characters acquire layers of increasingly fake-looking prosthetic
makeup. Except for Williams, the sitcom-meets-sci-fi acting
throughout the movie is strictly of television caliber.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins when Andrew is purchased by Richard Martin (Sam
Neill), a clockmaker known throughout the film simply as Sir, to be
a robotic servant in his picture-postcard California mansion. Sir
(looking and sounding like James Mason's double) is happily married
to Ma'am (Wendy Crewson). The couple have two girls, the adorable
7-year-old Amanda, known as Little Miss (Hallie Kate Eisenberg) and
her bratty 9-year-old sister Miss (Lindze Letherman), who orders
Andrew to jump out her bedroom window. (He obeys and is seriously
damaged and left with a lifelong terror of upper-story views.)
</P>
<P>
   It is after Andrew accidentally breaks one of Little Miss'
precious tiny glass horses and replaces it with an exquisite wooden
one of his own making that Sir notices Andrew's creativity and
realizes he's a kind of mechanical mutation and becomes his teacher
and legal guardian. As Andrew acquires knowledge and reaps a
fortune designing timepieces (Sir insists that Andrew, although a
robot, have his own bank account), he falls unrequitedly in love
with the now grown-up Little Miss (Embeth Davidtz), who marries
(unhappily) and has children. On requesting and being granted his
freedom, Andrew leaves the family to live in his own cozy,
self-designed beach house.
</P>
<P>
   The decades hurtle by, and the next thing you know, Andrew, who
now looks human but is still missing some human ingredients, meets
Little Miss' grown-up granddaughter Portia (Ms. Davidtz).
Technology has advanced to the point where the creation of androids
who are facsimile humans is possible. Collaborating with Rupert
Burns (Oliver Platt), a San Francisco scientific genius, Andrew,
motivated by his passion for Portia, pursues the seemingly
impossible goal of achieving full humanity.
</P>
<P>
   As befits a Robin Williams movie, the screenplay (by Nicholas
Kazan) pours on the sentimentality in lumpy, mawkish speeches about
freedom, the joys of sex and the meaning of life. Not even
Williams, pulling out every moist, sad-clown expression in his bag
of grimaces, can redeem these speeches from sappiness. But as it
lumbers toward a mystical romantic ending in an early-23rd-century
hospital, ``Bicentennial Man'' achieves the pop grandiloquence of a
``Star Trek'' installment. In its warm, fuzzy, self-congratulatory
humanistic vision, nothing in the universe beats being a
flesh-and-blood mortal.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Bicentennial Man'' is rated PG (Parental guidance
suggested). It has some fairly candid sexual talk.

ORIGINAL BUT CONFUSING `CHAMPIONS' FLOUTS DARING UNPREDICTABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Love him or hate him, you have to admit that Bruce Willis has
guts, and he also puts his money where his mouth is. No other
superstar of recent years has so consistently alternated his
predictable, overblown movie-star vehicles with such unpredictable,
smaller-budget and financially risky ventures.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he followed up ``Armageddon'' with ``The Sixth
Sense'' (a gamble that has paid off beyond anyone's wildest
expectations), and he's now followed up ``The Story of Us'' with
``Breakfast of Champions'' (a gamble that, based on its Seattle
International Film Festival reception last spring, is probably not
going to pay off at all).
</P>
<P>
   Willis also entirely financed this latest exercise in cinematic
daring with money from his own pocket, reportedly browbeat the
Disney company into distributing it against their will, and
otherwise stood behind the film while the rest of the world was
advising him to bury it in his back yard.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, here it is, and it's a glorious, totally
outrageous, off-the-wall mess of a movie that's likely to confound,
confuse and irritate audiences like no film of the year. I
personally enjoyed its daring unpredictability and sheer abandon,
though be warned I seem to be in a distinct minority.
</P>
<P>
   The film is, of course, an adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's 1973
best seller, ``Breakfast of Champions,'' about a highly successful
Midwestern car dealer named Dwayne Hoover (Willis) whose go-getter,
happy-family-man facade is a fraud: his wife (Glenne Headly) is a
pill-popper, his son (Lukas Haas) is a Liberace-like wimp, and
Dwayne is quietly dying inside.
</P>
<P>
   It's also about his closet-transvestite best friend and
second-in-command, Harry Le Sabre (Nick Nolte), and an obscure
writer and borderline psychotic named Kilgore Trout (Albert
Finney), who is coming to town to accept a literary award and who
Dwayne believes, for some reason, is a visionary with balm for his
weary soul and answers to the riddle of existence.
</P>
<P>
   And if the subject matter alone wasn't bizarre enough,
writer-director Alan Rudolph has gone all out to make the film his
own daring cinematic equivalent of Vonnegut's unique literary style
and sensibility. It's a cornucopia of bold and often surrealistic
visual, aural and structural effects _ some of which works, some of
which don't.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the cacophony are two oddly delightful lead
performances. Willis' Dwayne Hoover is a splendidly original, '90s
twist on the old Sinclair Lewis stereotype of the shallow,
ever-hustling Midwestern businessman, and Nolte plays the most
farcical character of his career with such relentless,
no-holds-barred fearlessness that he's a wonder to behold.
</P>
<P>
   As demanding and hard-to-follow and nerve-racking as the movie
undeniably is, there's also something quite refreshing about it. At
a time when the independent and foreign cinema has never been more
unadventurous, and even Rudolph's mentor, Robert Altman, makes only
conventional films, ``Breakfast'' is a movie that would have seemed
outrageous even in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast of Champions. Directed and written by Alan Rudolph.
Cast: Bruce Willis, Albert Finney, Nick Nolte, Glenne Headly, Lukas
Haas. Hollywood Pictures. 110 minutes. Rated R for sexual
references.

`RIDE' IS ANG LEE'S THRILLING TAKE ON THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is it about the myth of the West that so appeals to
overseas film directors?
</P>
<P>
   While American moviemakers like John Ford once embraced its
loner heroism, contemporary filmmakers (and audiences) have tended
to shy away from the wildness of the old West _ save for Clint
Eastwood's revisionist ``Unforgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   But recently the British director Stephen Frears (``The Hi-lo
Country'') and Taiwanese Ang Lee have gotten back in the saddle and
made an effort to reinterpret this movie staple from the point of
view of the outsider.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ride With the Devil,'' Lee's Civil War drama, he's mixed
zen with a Larry McMurtry sensibility, utilizing a cross-cultural
troupe of characters with a cause. In this case, men of the South
are mobilized to form a guerrilla warfare unit of Bushwhackers
wreaking havoc on the invading Union army and its sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   Two childhood friends, the poor German immigrant Jake Roedel
(Tobey Maguire) and wealthy plantation son Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet
Ulrich), enlist alongside leader Black John (James Caviezel), loose
cannon Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys Meyer), George Custer lookalike
George Clyde (Simon Baker) and his former slave, the quiet but
observant Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright).
</P>
<P>
   The men diligently and violently attempt to beat back a
formidable foe and face horrific deaths, destruction and decimation
not only to their own hides, but to a Deep South that they deeply
love.
</P>
<P>
   Lee cuts loose in the action sequences and certainly knows how
to stage a battle. The sight of Southern desperados holding off an
advancing Yankee unit in rather gentlemanly form is both thrilling
and anguishing. It adds another feather to the cap of a director
who has never shied away from experimenting with every genre,
including gay romantic comedy (``The Wedding Banquet''), Jane
Austen period piece (``Sense and Sensibility'') and the breakdown
of a family torn apart by the confusing '60s (``The Ice Storm'').
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Lonesome Dove,'' which ``Ride With the Devil'' often
resembles, these weathered-but-traditional men face the end of an
era as well as a way of life as they've known it and an air of
sadness and change permeates the film. But unlike McMurtry's epic
novel about two old friends and Texas Rangers who embark on a
cattle drive north to renew their lives, ``Ride With the Devil''
doesn't offer much texture or depth of character.
</P>
<P>
   One principal is killed off before the halfway mark and much of
the rest of the film serves as a memorial to him that sparks a
tenuous attraction between Jake and a widow named Sue Lee (Jewel),
who was in love with the dead character. While Tobey Maguire and
the singer verbally spar (a sure sign they're meant for each
other), the deeper love affair in ``Ride With the Devil'' lies
between its two outcasts _ Holt and Jake _ who, being black and an
immigrant, find they have only each other for true and equal
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has cast his film with the cream of rising actors. While
they all contribute as much as they can in such a large ensemble
enterprise, it's Wright, who played the painter Jean-Michel
Basquiat in Julian Schnabel's ``Basquiat,'' who steals the show as
an insular man with a unique wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   As the war ends, the film fumbles for an appropriate resolution,
but doesn't find one with any dramatic tension. After such a
thrilling ride through a compelling war story, with its alliances
and losses, that old standby, love, feels anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   Ride With the Devil. Directed by Ang Lee. Written by James
Schamus. Cast: Tobey Maguire, Skeet Ulrich, Jeffrey Wright, Jewel.

`TOPSY-TURVY': GILBERT AND SULLIVAN GET BAC TO THE DRAWING BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy'' was shown as part of this year's New York Film
Festival. Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which
appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Leigh's grandly entertaining ``Topsy-Turvy'' is one of
those films that create a mix of erudition, pageantry and
delectable acting opportunities, much as ``Shakespeare in Love''
did last year. Instead of a lovestruck young playwright, it
presents the curiously matched personalities of the librettist
William Schwenk Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan in the
midst of a robust, knowing, frequently hilarious look at the
musical theater over which they held sway.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh orchestrates this delightful film so well that he
fittingly presents his own directorial credit just as Sullivan,
preparing to conduct the new operetta ``Princess Ida'' in 1884,
takes an introductory bow.
</P>
<P>
   This is an interesting place for the story of ``Topsy-Turvy'' to
start. Because when ``Princess Ida'' turns out to be a dud, it
means a dead end for the Gilbert and Sullivan oeuvre and a
challenge to these established hit-makers to reinvent themselves
rather late in the game. Leigh and his large array of performers,
who obviously lived and breathed their roles before filming (in
keeping with the filmmaker's customary method), vigorously and
amusingly explore what it means for an artist to renew his energies
by returning to square one.
</P>
<P>
   As the film begins, the newly knighted Sir Arthur Sullivan (the
excellent Allan Corduner) has begun to turn away from the kind of
comic operetta that won him wealth and celebrity. He has also grown
so distant from the not-yet-titled Gilbert that the two men do not
cross paths until well into the story. The dour Gilbert, played
with wonderfully literate crankiness by Jim Broadbent, is too prim
and stubborn to understand his partner's dissatisfaction. Only when
the famous impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook) tries to
force his stars to settle their differences does Gilbert have to
acknowledge a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Though the differences between these two strong personalities
are deftly captured, ``Topsy-Turvy'' (which takes its title from
Sullivan's dismissive view of Gilbert's tidy plot contrivances) is
much bigger than their story. Its aspirations are thrilling in
their own right. Leigh's gratifyingly long view of life in the
theater (Gilbert has a dentist who tells him ''Princess Ida'' could
have been shorter) includes not only historical and biographical
details but also the painstaking process of creating a Gilbert and
Sullivan production from the ground up. The film details all this
with the luxury of a leisurely pace, as opposed to a slow one.
</P>
<P>
   The Gilbert and Sullivan turnaround begins with a lightning bolt
of inspiration, in the form of a London exhibition on Japanese
culture. Gilbert's wife (Lesley Manville) drags him to see this,
and somewhere in the midst of the kimonos and Kabuki, ``The
Mikado'' is born. The latter half of ``Topsy-Turvy'' describes
everything about creating this operetta, as in a wonderful sequence
that creates the famous fluttering and tippy-toeing to ``Three
Little Maids From School.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are Gilbert's priceless ideas about how to direct
actors. Broadbent's role is beautifully written (``I'm sure we
shall reap the benefits of your remonstrations in the fullness of
time,'' he tells one complainer), as is the actors' side of the
story. One performer is heard to complain about management,
``particularly when the management have difficulty in locating the
various whereabouts'' of the posterior and the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   As ``The Mikado'' takes shape, the film offers exultant excerpts
performed by actors who are as comfortable in full stage regalia as
they are behind the scenes. Well trained by Gilbert to pronounce
words like ``persiflage'' and ``corroborative,'' the performers (a
fine troupe including Timothy Spall, Shirley Henderson and familiar
faces from earlier Leigh films) make it a palpable triumph. But for
Gilbert, who calls his mother ``the vicious woman who bore me into
this ridiculous world,'' there are no happy endings. ``There's
something inherently disappointing about success,'' he insists.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh's ``Topsy-Turvy'' is delightful proof to the contrary.

   Rembrandts, Anyone?
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Any seasoned collector of old masters will remember
the two auctions of extraordinary drawings from Chatsworth, the
Derbyshire home of the Duke of Devonshire, at Christie's in London
in 1984 and 1987. Both were landmark sales at which institutions
like the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles and collectors like
Ian Woodner snapped up drawings by artists including Rembrandt,
Barocci, Poussin and Rubens at record prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sale contained drawings you were just not going to see on
the market again,'' said Noel Annesley, deputy chairman of
Christie's. ``It broke all the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in what is considered something of an event, Christie's in
New York will be selling two Rembrandts from the Chatsworth sales
on Jan. 28. The drawings come from the estate of Michael S.
Currier, a rancher and philanthropist who was a great-grandson of
Andrew W. Mellon, the financier who was a founder of the National
Gallery of Art in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Currier also collected Asian art. ``The penwork in both drawings
is surprisingly similar to the Chinese,'' Annesley said.
</P>
<P>
   The drawings are both landscapes showing different views of
Amsterdam. ``The Ramparts Near the Bulwark Beside the City Gate at
St. Anthonispoort, Amsterdam'' was drawn on the northeast side of
the city, a few minutes from Rembrandt's house.
</P>
<P>
   His technique suggests it was drawn between 1648 and 1652,
Christie's experts say. Currier bought the drawing in the 1987 sale
for $2.2 million. Christie's now expects it to bring $1.8 million
to $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The other drawing, ``The Bulwark de Rose and the Windmill de
Smeerpot,'' depicts a group of houses near the artist's home. The
bulwark, on the west side of Amsterdam, was the last of three
bastions that ran from the sea in a straight line.
</P>
<P>
   The shadow cast on the ground by the row of houses on the left
indicates that the scene was sketched on a summer morning and
presented as if the viewer were standing in the landscape. Currier
bought it at the 1984 sale for $686,782. Christie's now expects it
to sell for $1.8 million to $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Annesley said he thought the drawings would appeal not only to
old master devotees but also to buyers in other collecting
categories. ``In today's market you can still buy superb examples
of old master drawings by great artists, which is quite impossible
to do with paintings,'' he said. ``There's enough out there that it
is still possible to form a great old master drawings collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital Diversity
</P>
<P>
   As more and more artists explore film, video and Internet art,
institutions like the Brooklyn Academy of Music are expanding their
programs to include the best multimedia work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new artist's horizon that we want to work toward
developing,'' said Joseph V. Melillo, the academy's executive
producer. ``For the next Whitney Biennial to have Internet art,
well, that's the shot heard round the world.''
</P>
<P>
   This week the academy announced plans to create an in-house
digital media lab in its main building in Fort Greene. The academy
has also established ``Arts in Multimedia,'' a two-year initiative
with Lucent Technologies in which artists work with scientists in a
virtual studio to create projects using new media.
</P>
<P>
   The academy is also introducing a series of Web documentaries on
the academy's Web site, www.bam.org. The new digital media lab is
scheduled to be up and running by February.
</P>
<P>
   Just who will be allowed to use the lab will depend on those
selected for its ``Multimedia'' program. An advisory panel of art
and media experts will review proposals from artists who have been
invited by the academy and Lucent to apply to the program. Three
artists will be chosen and will become partners with researchers
from Bell Labs, the research and development arm of Lucent, on
their project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a conference last month in Manhattan at Lucent's
headquarters to introduce the work of the invited artists and the
researchers who were interested in the program,'' Melillo said.
``We will get 19 proposals to review in January and from there will
choose the three artists.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning artists will start work in February and have three
months to create a project, to be exhibited in May. Although the
commitment from Lucent is for only two years, Melillo said the
academy was committed to multimedia art and would continue
developing more such projects.
</P>
<P>
   Cube Squared
</P>
<P>
   Jay Jopling, one of London's most influential contemporary-art
dealers, has gained a reputation for showing the work of many young
British artists _ like Damien Hirst and Marc Quinn, who were
included in ``Sensation,'' the exhibition at the Royal Academy in
London and the Brooklyn Museum of Art _ before they were famous.
</P>
<P>
   While Jopling's shows have had huge reverberations in the art
world, they were conceived out of White Cube, his tiny gallery on
Duke Street, St. James'. ``I think it's the smallest art gallery in
Europe,'' Jopling said. ``But I've never shown an artist twice in
that space.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Jopling will have an alternative space. In April he plans to
open a considerably larger second gallery in Hoxton Square, in
London's East End, just north of the financial district.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Mike Rundell, the architect who designed Hirst's
restaurant Pharmacy in Notting Hill, the new space will be called
White Cube2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The location is crucial,'' Jopling said. ``This is a vital
cultural neighborhood at the moment, a place where the local
council allows artists to live and work.''
</P>
<P>
   The gallery is to open with an exhibition of work by many of
Britain's top contemporary artists, including Hirst, Jake and Dinos
Chapman, Tracey Emin, Antony Gormley, Mona Hatoum, Sam Taylor-Wood
(who is married to Jopling) and Gavin Turk. &QL;

 &HT;    EXPERIMENT POINTS TO TEST FOR CHILDHOOD ATTENTION DISORDER
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Using a radioactive ``label,'' scientists have
demonstrated abnormally high concentrations of a key brain protein
in seven adults who had been diagnosed with attention deficit
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The test suggests that parents of children suspected of having
the learning and behavioral problem may someday be able to have
their children tested before deciding whether to have them take
potent and controversial drugs such as Ritalin and other
stimulants.
</P>
<P>
   But Bertha Madras, one of the Harvard Medical School researchers
who performed the initial test, said many more experiments must be
performed before such a test is available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial data is robust,'' she said Thursday in a telephone
interview, ``but a cascade of experiments have to be done before we
can say we have a diagnostic tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common
psychiatric illness that is believed to affect between 3 and 5
percent of children in the United States. In general, it affects
such functions as working memory, self-control and motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Madras, a professor of biopsychology at the medical school, said
the test showed that the seven adults diagnosed with attention
deficit disorder had on average a 70 percent elevation in
concentrations of a brain protein called the dopamine transporter.
</P>
<P>
   By linking a radioactive iodine molecule to a substance that
locks onto the dopamine transporter, the researchers were able to
use imaging instruments to directly measure the concentrations of
transporter.
</P>
<P>
   The study is described in a report being published Friday in the
British medical journal, the Lancet.
</P>
<P>
   The finding appears to confirm theories about the way ADHD
affects its victims, but Madras said tests on larger populations of
adults and later on children must be performed.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have applied for Food and Drug Administration
approval for a second test with a larger group of adults, she said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists and psychiatrists say the condition seems to
affect girls and boys differently.
</P>
<P>
   Most girls with ADHD have a form known as Type A, which is
characterized primarily by inattentiveness and distractibility, and
less by hyperactivity and impulsive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The most common form among boys is known as Type B. Rather than
flightiness, persons with this form tend to be hyperactive and
impulsive.
</P>
<P>
   A Type C involves symptoms of both Types A and B. And Type D
patients have symptoms that can disrupt everyday life, but none
that clearly fit the other three forms.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that academic performance of 90 percent of
the school-age patients improves with stimulant medication,
principally the drug methylphenidate, marketed as Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   However, the treatment is controversial, since methylphenidate
shares many of the pharmacological effects of cocaine and is
addictive to test animals.
</P>
<P>
   It also is one of the most commonly diverted and stolen
substances in America, and more high school students are reported
to abuse it than receive it under prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the diagnosis of ADHD is based on behavioral studies
and can involve often-subjective judgements on the part of
therapists.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus development panel convened last year by the National
Institutes of Health recommended continued use of stimulant drugs
for ADHD, but also called for more research toward understanding
the nature of the disease and developing a more precise diagnostic
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Although the chemical reasons for ADHD are not clearly
understood, scientists have speculated that the brain's failure to
control the activity of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that relays
signals between nerve cells, is involved.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, some researchers believe the transporter protein _
the ``truck'' that moves dopamine from one cell to the next _ is
key to the condition.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the transporter protein gathers up the dopamine after
it has stimulated its target cells and returns it to the cells that
released it.
</P>
<P>
   Methyphenidate, cocaine and other stimulant drugs are known to
inhibit the transporter protein. By taking the ``trucks'' off the
highway, the drugs cause dopamine to build up and continue to
stimulate its targeted nerve cells, Madras explained.
</P>
<P>
   This has the paradoxical effect of calming persons with ADHD.
Some researchers think this is because their condition stems from a
deficiency of target cells or of the cell receptors that react with
dopamine.

LONG A FORCE IN LIGHTING AND CRAFTS

 (Attn: Md.)  (af) 
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How's this for a quintessential New York client list:
the New York Stock Exchange, City Hall, Waldorf-Astoria, Morgan
Bank, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Ronald McDonald House and
Trinity Church, on Wall Street?
</P>
<P>
   These institutions have all been clients of Rambusch, a small
101-year-old family business that makes high-quality custom light
fixtures, stained-glass windows, mosaic murals and wrought-iron
gates for projects all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition tracing a century of Rambusch commissions in
perhaps every conceivable style can be seen at the National Arts
Club through Jan. 1. The show, and an accompanying booklet with a
self-guided walking tour of selected Rambusch commissions in New
York, resembles a history of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been involved in the initial construction of
dozens of buildings, as well as scores of major historic
restoration projects, including the Shubert Theater, the Moorish
interior of the Central Synagogue and St. Bartholomew's Episcopal
Church, on Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting-edge projects include lights commissioned by the
architect Michael Gabellini for the clothing designer Jil Sander's
headquarters in Hamburg and boutiques in America.
</P>
<P>
   Now a fourth-generation family enterprise, Rambusch was founded
in 1898 by Frode C.V. Rambusch, 29, a Danish immigrant, who decided
to seek his fortune in New York after attending the Royal Art
Academy in Copenhagen and schools of applied art in Berlin and
Munich. An accomplished painter, he opened a company specializing
in decorative murals, ecclesiastical ornaments and wrought-iron
metalwork.
</P>
<P>
   He was bankrolled by a partner, William F. Hencken, a New Yorker
and Princeton graduate whose family was seeking business experience
for their son. The family advanced $2,500 to establish the Rambusch
Glass and Decorating Co., at 160 Fifth Avenue, where McKim, Mead &AMP;
White had its architectural offices.
</P>
<P>
   Frode Rambusch was quick to see the potential of Thomas Edison's
tungsten filament lamp, the light bulb. In the show are drawings,
from 1908, of Rambusch's ``light shield,'' a hammered copper
fixture that covered the light socket and irritatingly bright bare
bulb. His ever-evolving light fixtures were adopted by churches,
opera houses, vaudeville theaters and movie palaces.
</P>
<P>
   His sons, in turn, invented the famous Downlite, a ceiling
fixture patented in 1936. The company's art-metal workshop did the
lighting for the Daily News building of 1930, the interiors and
exteriors of the many Horn &AMP; Hardart Automats and about 1,000 movie
theaters, including the Fulton in Brooklyn and long-gone Roxy in
Manhattan. (There are now 1,082 variations on the Downlite.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, the company added a stained-glass studio. The show has
a stained-glass window, with accompanying drawings and mock-ups,
made for the McCormick Spice Co. headquarters in Sparks, Md.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Rambush fabricated the abstract stained-glass facade of
the American Airlines terminal at Kennedy International Airport for
the architects Kahn &AMP; Jacobs. The wall, which is 23 feet high and
330 feet long, is thought to be the largest stained-glass window in
the world. Mosaic projects in the show include a sanctuary wall
that is 64 feet high and sheathed in gold mosaic.
</P>
<P>
   Rambusch made metal decorations for ocean liners and sculptures
for public buildings, including one for the 1939 World's Fair, a
metal sculpture for the Science and Education Building, which is in
the show.
</P>
<P>
   During the Depression, the company was saved by its many
commissions for houses of worship, including marble lecterns, metal
candlesticks, hammered-silver communion cups, tabernacles and
crosses. The company did the Fifth Avenue lobby for the Empire
State Building, the interiors for the Stork Club and Century
Association and the original ceiling of Radio City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, its metal shops created a prototype for
radar antenna. The company also applied stained-glass techniques to
the art of camouflage: before-and-after aerial photos of the Glen
L. Martin aircraft plant in Baltimore show how three million square
feet of plant and runways were painted so they could not be
detected from the air.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Rambusch makes architectural decorations and lighting
fixtures for such household names as the architects Frank Gehry,
Robert A.M. Stern and Charles Gwathmey. The company is now run by
two fourth-generation Rambusches: the twins Edwin and Martin
Rambusch, age 33.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin is in charge of the lighting division and Martin the
crafts (art metal, stained glass, mosaics, tapestries and
liturgical designs and furnishings). Their father, Viggo Bech
Ansgar Rambusch, continues to work on ecclesiastical commissions.
The company employs more than 40 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one Rambusch style,'' said Catha Grace Rambusch,
the guest curator of the show, company archivist and mother of the
twins. ``Everything is custom-designed and resolved in coordination
with the design of the job. We have a guild system. The client
works with our designers, engineers and craftsmen, who tell them
when a design will or will not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambusch did the complicated light fixtures for the decorative
arts rooms at the Getty Museum in California; they were hired by
Howard Brandstom, a New York lighting consultant, who worked with
the designer Thierry Despont on the Getty project. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``The Rambusches had to develop a brand new piece of equipment
for the Getty,'' Brandstom said. ``They came up with a suggested
solution, a fixture that is a wall washer, a downlight and accent
light, all coming out of one small aperture in the ceiling _
instead of having 60 or 70 fixtures hanging like dead bats from
tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's prototype of the chrome-plated copper fixture that
Gehry designed for the Conde Nast lunchroom at 4 Times Square, to
open this winter, looks as soft as a handkerchief floating in
midair. In fact, it houses both an uplight and a downlight. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The cafeteria commission is the second with Gehry: Edwin
Rambusch spent three years creating the optics for his Bilbao
Museum in Spain. Rambusch craftsmen also fabricated the new
8-foot-tall bracket lanterns outside Baruch College, which were
inspired by the Strozzi Palace in Milan. Edwin Rambusch worked with
Davis, Brody architects, who transformed a former IRT subway
headquarters for Baruch.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Shannon of Moed de Armas &AMP; Shannon, architects in New York,
commissioned light fixtures for the lobby of the Bear Stearns
building at 245 Park Avenue. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``The company is as modern now as it was in 1900,'' he said.
``They understand the architect's ideas and goals. They get into
all the details and have the highest levels of engineering, finish
and craftsmanship. The bronze fixtures at 245 Park look like Swiss
watches.''

XENIA SEEBERG'S `LEXX' APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Xenia
Seeberg in a scene from ``Lexx.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Is the world ready for ``Lexx?''
 &HT;    Debuting Jan. 7 on the Sci-Fi Channel, the Canadian/German-made
series gets the new millennium off to a quirky, sex-drenched start
with a one-hour premiere and a teaser episode entitled ``Nook.''
 &HT;    ``Lexx'' centers on Xev (Xenia Seeberg), an unquenchable sex
slave, Kai (Michael McManus), a 2,000-year-old, dead assassin
adored by Xev, and Stanley Tweedle (Brian Downey), an inept captain
with the hots for Xev. Then there's 790 (Jeffrey Hirschfield), a
robot head who's also smitten with Xev. The four coexist _ with
some difficulty _ aboard their powerful ship, Lexx, a sentient,
genetically enhanced insect.
 &HT;    ``Whatever you've seen of other sci-fi series, this is nothing
like them,'' says Seeberg, a 27-year-old German actress with
bee-stung lips and bright, blue-green eyes. ``I'm not going to say
there's nothing good on television, but there's nothing out there
that's as twisted as our series.
 &HT;    ``It's got a very dark and, I would even say, British kind of
humor,'' Seeberg says. ``That's what drew me to the show in the
first place, but that's also what makes it special. We don't take
ourselves or the characters or humankind in general too seriously,
and that's very important.
 &HT;    ``Smart viewers will get it right away,'' she adds. ``Everybody
else will get that it's pretty much about human nature and the
various aspects of human nature. And they will see a lot about
sexuality, not that they'll get to see a lot of sexuality.
 &HT;    ```Lexx' reflects what's on people's minds.''
 &HT;    The ambitious, in-your-face series, shot in Nova Scotia and
Germany, emerged from a batch of television movies that aired as
``Tales from a Parallel Universe.'' Eva Habermann played Zev _ as
the character's name was formerly spelled _ in the earlier
incarnation, and actually appears in two of the Sci-Fi Channel
episodes before giving way to Seeberg's Xev, the way Terry
Farrell's Jadzia Dax gave way to Nicole de Boer's Ezri Dax on
``DS9.''
 &HT;    After accepting the role, Seeberg watched tapes of Habermann's
performance, but primarily sought to make the character her own.
She wanted to create a Xev who _ beneath that revealing outfit and
stark red wig _ is simultaneously smart, funny and sexy.
 &HT;    ``She's a little different from script to script, depending on
what she's called upon to do,'' Seeberg says by telephone from
Germany. ``Sometimes she's more of a warrior or fighter, someone
who has a sense of justice, and in other episodes she's very
lighthearted.
 &HT;    ``And, in other episodes, it is more about her lust, her
elevated libido, and she just wants to have sex,'' the actress
adds. ``She especially wants to have sex when there's definitely no
chance.
 &HT;    ``Xev is the character who always wants to go to other planets,
the one who drives the crew into dangerous situations,'' Seeberg
says. ``Basically she's looking for trouble, and she doesn't mind
facing some trouble if there's a chance of meeting some guys who
might be potential partners, so to speak.''
 &HT;    The Sci-Fi Channel plans to air all 20 existing episodes of
``Lexx'' this season. Among the upcoming hours are ``Lyekka,''
which introduces Seeberg as Xev, and ``Brigadoom,'' a musical
episode that spotlights her skills as a singer.
 &HT;    If audiences take to the show as they have to such Sci-Fi
Channel fare as ``Farscape'' and ``First Wave,'' the network will
pick up the next 20 episodes of ``Lexx,'' currently in production.
 &HT;    ``That would be great,'' Seeberg says. ``What we're doing now is
not really a continuation of what you'll be seeing, because the
concept has changed a little bit.
 &HT;    ``Every episode you'll be seeing pretty much has a beginning,
middle and an end, and from episode to episode we're traveling from
one place to another,'' she explains. ``This season, it's more like
one big story, but one episode twists into the next one.
 &HT;    ``So it's a little more of an ongoing story,'' she concludes.
``We'll have a few more guest characters this season that stay
around a while, and Xev does change a little bit again, too.''
 &HT;    Seeberg giggles nervously.
 &HT;    ``I can't tell you about that now,'' she says. ``But at least
it's still me playing Xev.''

blends well, especially on darker skin tones, and goes on smoothly.
Extra Creamy Compact Foundation (V2008, $40) provides excellent
coverage for people with flawed or unevenly colored skin, but it
still gives a natural appearance without a heavy feel.
</P>
<P>
   CHEEKS: Compact blush (V2062, $36) has built-in shimmer and is
easy to apply without blotching.
</P>
<P>
   EYES: Comfort eye pencil (V2000, $23) lines the lid and rim of
the eye. Glides on easily without smearing. Rich colors have good
holding power. Eyeshadow Trio (V2052, V2053, $30), applied to lid
and crease, blends well, goes on smoothly and is true to its color.
White highlighter ($23), used under the brow, is a true white color
with shimmer that helps open up the eye for a more youthful
appearance. Ideal for women who like to wear diamond, silver or
clear crystal earrings.
</P>
<P>
   LIPS: Lipliner (V2011, $23) is applied to the rim of the mouth
and over the entire lip to make lipstick last longer. The liner has
a satiny finish and goes on smoothly. Lipstick (V2054, $23) is
creamy and shiny, with a rich, smooth finish.
</P>
<P>
   THE BOTTOM LINE: A high-quality brand that contains everything a
professional makeup artist looks for in a cosmetic. Great for
people who want a polished look with a rich color and lightweight
texture. Might be a bit pricey for someone who doesn't wear makeup
often.
</P>
<P>
   STILA
</P>
<P>
   (modeled by Linda Mom)
</P>
<P>
   THE BASICS: Liquid foundation (Shade b, $30) is extremely
lightweight and translucent. Blends quickly into skin and
disappears. The look is natural, but it doesn't cover flaws well,
even when used with Stick Concealer (Shade b, $17). Pressed powder
($32), applied over foundation, does a good job of eliminating
shine.
</P>
<P>
   CHEEKS: Brava cheek powder ($15), lightly applied, is a soft hue
that looks natural and stays on well.
</P>
<P>
   EYES: Pewter eye shadow ($15) on the lid has a nice shimmer,
goes on well and can double as an eyeliner. Viola shadow ($15),
applied to the crease, goes on well and blends easily. Color turns
out rosy with a slight shimmer. Twilight shadow ($15), applied
under the brow, gives definition and depth to the eye.
</P>
<P>
   LIPS: Lipstick (Joan, $16) is creamy, easy to apply and holds
color. Has a shimmery, wet look.
</P>
<P>
   ADDED TOUCH: All Over Shimmer ($28) comes in a tube and can be
gently dabbed over the entire face, after makeup is applied. Also
blends well on neck and shoulders for a subtle shimmer when wearing
low-cut dresses or tops.
</P>
<P>
   THE BOTTOM LINE: Eye shadow colors are trendy and great for
evening. But the foundation needs to be boosted with a dual
powder/foundation to provide better coverage for someone with
flawed skin or discolorations.
</P>
<P>
   SONIA KASHUK
</P>
<P>
   (modeled by Jessica Hanna)
</P>
<P>
   THE BASICS: Perfecting liquid foundation (Creme No. 6, $9.99)
comes in a pump for easy control. Good for complexions with golden
tones. Dual coverage powder foundation (Sand, $9.99) helps liquid
foundation stay on longer and provides added coverage.
</P>
<P>
   CHEEKS: Beautifying blush (Dawn, $7.99), dusted on the cheeks,
goes on smoothly and has a nice color that holds well after being
applied.
</P>
<P>
   EYES: Enhance Eye Color (Plum, $4.99) for lids blends well and
goes on subtly. A good complement for people with light brown or
hazel eyes. Enhance Eye Color (Sable, $4.99) works well in the
crease for definition and under the rim of the eye to keep other
makup from smudging. Enhance Eye Color (Bronze, $4.99) gives a nice
shimmer to the eye when used under the brow.
</P>
<P>
   LIPS: Lip definer (Wine, $4.99), used on the rim of the mouth
and over the entire lip, looks more like fuchsia when applied.
Luxury Lip Color (Rosewood, $5.99) looks moist and shiny when
applied to the lip and topped with lip gloss (Flirt, $5.99).
</P>
<P>
   THE BOTTOM LINE: Good quality for the price, but the foundation
and concealer don't provide enough coverage for flawed skin. A good
set of brushes is a must to apply and blend this makeup properly.
</P>
<P>
   AND WHAT ABOUT NEW YEAR'S EVE?
</P>
<P>
   The glam face for the big night will have shimmer and shine,
Russell says.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes will be adorned in silver or gold shadows to make a
dramatic statement, or as an accent to smoky shades of plum, mauve
or pewter.
</P>
<P>
   Lips will glisten in tones of wine and roses, with a dab of
metallic shadow or gloss in the center of the lip for added
sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   ``But don't be too glitzy. You don't want to overdo it,''
advises Russell, noting that subtle beauty is still the look of the
season.

 &HT;    Dark wisdom runs beneath `Mother's' camp
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drag queens, drug addicts, strong women, angry tears, erotic
entanglements and knotty, naughty plotting: They're the usual
elements in the movies of Spanish writer-director Pedro Almodovar
(``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown''). But in ``All About
My Mother,'' his trademark devices come together in unexpectedly
poignant ways.
</P>
<P>
   While his previous two films, ``Live Flesh'' and ``The Flower of
My Secret,'' showed the auteur in a maturing mood, in his new
comedy-drama he reaches a new emotional depth that complements his
signature playfulness. Often deeply ludicrous, it's just as often
deeply moving.
</P>
<P>
   A tribute to actresses (of all kinds), ``Mother'' is a virtually
male-free fable with a title inspired by that backstage classic,
``All About Eve.'' The movie's other main touchstone is ``A
Streetcar Named Desire,'' a play that Manuela (Cecilia Roth) takes
her son Esteban (Eloy Azorin) to see for his 17th birthday.
Starring as Blanche Dubois is Huma Rojo (Marisa Paredes), an
actress of the glamorous old school whose autograph Esteban hopes
to get. Chasing her taxi down the street, he's struck and killed by
a car.
</P>
<P>
   The coordinator of organ transplants at a Madrid hospital,
Manuela finds herself on the receiving end of the counseling she
offers bereaved families. It's the first of many deliberate echoes
and coincidences in a movie built like a hall of mirrors, featuring
characters who, like Blanche, come to depend on the kindness of
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The grief-stricken Manuela travels to her old hometown,
Barcelona, in search of Esteban's father, a man she always told her
son was dead. That Manuela's ex-husband has renamed ``herself''
Lola is a good example of the off-kilter landscape Almodovar's
characters occupy. The bizarre, organic Barcelona architecture of
Antonio Gaudi creates a visual correlative to the movie's emotional
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   During her search for the elusive Lola, Manuela encounters her
old friend Agrado (Antonia San Juan), a motormouthed transsexual
hooker, and also Sister Rosa (Penelope Cruz), a social-working nun
coping with a strained relationship with her parents. (Rosa's
father doesn't even recognize her on sight.)
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar views family as something that is best provided by
friends, not blood kin. As fate continues to twist for Manuela, she
finds herself becoming a mother figure, in different ways, to Rosa
and also to Huma. The actress hires Manuela as an assistant,
unaware of her own indirect connection to Esteban's death.
</P>
<P>
   When one of the ``Streetcar'' leads fails to show up, Huma asks
Manuela if she can act. She says yes: ``I can lie very well, and
I'm used to improvising.'' Her words suggest that all women,
through dealing with the caprices of the opposite sex, learn how to
perform and play-act in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   The world of men is indicted by its absence in ``Mother.''
Agrado and Lola even seem to be trying to escape that world through
their voluntary gender-bending, though only one of them is
successful. ``Lola's got the worst of men and the worst of women,''
Manuela claims.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Mother,'' Almodovar fuses his love of artifice and
exaggeration with deeper emotional resonance than ever before. The
sets are the brightly colored eye candy he's always favored. But
Roth's guttural wail of grief in the film's first half-hour is of
an intensity we've never heard before in his work. (Roth, who has a
fading, lived-in beauty, taps reserves of startling emotional
complexity.) The movie also relishes the catty melodramatics that
fuel the glossy 1950s women's films Almodovar clearly adores. Huma
is a grande dame who can utter lines like ``Smoke is all there's
been in my life.'' Of her wayward, drug-using lover, she says,
``She's hooked on junk, but I'm hooked on her.''
</P>
<P>
   By this point, you're likely to be hooked by a movie that can
wink at its own campy sensibility while still grabbing you by the
gut. Dark and tender in equal measures, it beautifully balances
humor and heartache. Even when it's trafficking in sex jokes, it is
informed by a grown-up understanding of the ways in which actions
create consequences. ``All About My Mother,'' which earned
Almodovar the best director prize at this year's Cannes Film
Festival, celebrates the gift and burden of loving other people.
It's a movie wise to the knowledge that grief brings growth, that
life goes on, that even if the pain won't go away overnight, one
day it goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All About
</P>
<P>
   My Mother''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Penelope Cruz and Antonia
San Juan. Rated R for language, drug content and sexuality,
including strong sexual dialogue. In Spanish with subtitles. 1
hour, 41 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Spain's bad-boy filmmaker grows up with this humane
celebration of nurturing women.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar
</P>
<P>
   prospects: It's one of the best bets in the foreign film
category.

 &HT;    Beloved mouse brings joy to the Little house
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When rodents show up, you have to act fast or they quickly
multiply. Like the tiny, sweet, spool-pushing mouse Mr. Jingles in
``The Green Mile.'' And now, the slightly larger, talking,
roadster-driving title rodent in ``Stuart Little.''
</P>
<P>
   Based very loosely on E.B. White's 1945 children's book, Stuart
is a 3-inch-tall, computer-animated wonder voiced by Michael J.
Fox. He brushes his teeth, gargles and aw-shucks smiles with such
convincing visuals that you'll swear he's the best critter since
``Babe.''
</P>
<P>
   And his movie does start out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little'' opens with all the fabled charm of an
inventive pop-up book. Stuart is an orphan in a glossy, stylized
and distinctly pristine modern-day New York City that glistens with
the candy-colored allure of a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   His story, at first, unfolds as slowly, effortlessly and
magically as a rising ``Nutcracker'' Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   The human Little family, of course, adopts him. They're the kind
of people who speak in magnanimous phrases. When they arrive at the
orphanage to make a selection, they aren't merely nervous, but
``tingling with anticipation.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Stuart nestles in the embrace of Geena Davis (who warmly
plays the mother in a role she could do blindfolded) and gets to
know contentious adoptive brother Jonathan Lipnicki (who doesn't
appear to have aged more than a day since ``Jerry Maguire''),
``Stuart Little'' is the kind of movie that a family could end up
filing on the video shelf between ``A Christmas Story'' and ``Fairy
Tale _ A True Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's a second half. The film deterioriates
into a typical, which-way-did-he-go chase flick as a coven of cats
tries to make lunch meat of our star mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The movie casts off a lot of its charm for cheap laughs (voicing
the effeminate kitty Snowbell, Nathan Lane utters lines like ``I
think I'm going to cough up a furball''), a bit of slapstick and
even one cat calling out a mild obscenity.
</P>
<P>
   Many children are likely to love it, though. So save a space on
the video shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geena Davis, Jonathan Lipnicki and the voice of Michael
J. Fox. Rated PG for brief profanity. 1 hour, 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A cute, amazingly humanlike mouse in a movie that
gets less and less adorable as the frames flash by.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar prospects: It has a chance for its special effects.

 &HT;    Sumptuous scenery, edgy politics mark latest retelling of Anna's
adventures in Siam
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though you might expect a hidden orchestra to launch into
``Shall We Dance,'' the latest telling of ``Anna and the King'' is
a lavish costume drama, without songs, that holds its own against
the beloved 1956 musical ``The King and I.''
</P>
<P>
   A mixture of old-fashioned moviemaking with contemporary
political correctness, it arrives at exactly the right time of
year: It's ideal for families looking for a multiplex alternative
to a fifth viewing of ``Toy Story 2'' or those movies with talking
mice and lovable androids.
</P>
<P>
   It also fills the bill for anyone looking for holiday spectacle.
The movie includes exotic locales, opulent interiors, silk evening
gowns, elephants and, for more restless viewers, bloodshed and
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   This fourth adaptation (including last year's animated feature)
of the diaries of British governess Anna Leonowens introduces the
young widow and son Louis (Tom Felton) as they arrive in Siam,
filled with both enthusiasm and muted panic. She has been hired by
King Mongkut (Chow Yun-Fat) to tutor his children in the Western
manner. ``The ways of England are the ways of the world,'' she says
approvingly. ``It's a wise man who knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   A wise man, maybe, but a stubborn one. The king doesn't bother
to grant Anna an audience for three weeks, and he fails to come
through on his promise of a house outside the palace walls. On top
of this, Anna discovers that she has a bigger job ahead than
tutoring the spoiled crown prince (Keith Chin): He has almost 60
siblings from the king's stable of 23 wives and 42 concubines.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the musical or the 1946 dramatic version with Irene
Dunne and Rex Harrison will find comfort in familiar subplots and
details. The king's advisers refer to Anna as ``sir,'' because no
Siamese woman would ever be as direct with the king as she is. Even
worse, she refuses to prostrate herself when the ruler enters a
room. One important subplot involves the new concubine Tuptim (Bai
Ling) and her forbidden love for her childhood sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Chow does not utter the musical's famous ``et
cetera, et cetera.'' Anna gives the prince a copy of ``Uncle Tom's
Cabin,'' but a ballet performed by the court doesn't follow. And
the king isn't bald.
</P>
<P>
   The movie introduces an edgy political tone with a series of
attacks on villages by Burmese death squads. Heightening the
East-meets-West tension between Anna and her employer is the rumor
that these guerrillas might secretly be backed by the British.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the movie, though, is the thawing relationship
between the strong-willed teacher and the equally bullheaded king.
She tries to improve his conscience; he tries to loosen her up.
``You still refuse to live,'' he berates her, because she is still
mourning her dead husband. At moments like this, you can feel
screenwriter Steve Meerson pushing these 19th-century characters a
little too awkwardly into the 20th.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also pushes too hard with the almost-romance between
Anna and Mongkut. While both Foster and Chow are engaging actors,
they never spark romantically in the ways you know the filmmakers
intended; a near-kiss is more a miscalculation than a swoon-making
moment. You get a better dose of repressed longing between proper
Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner in the musical.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's biggest misstep is an attempt to turn Anna into an
action figure near the end. She's responsible for brainstorming a
plan that repels an army of rebels, just when they're about to
capture the king. It's as though the movie were temporarily
hijacked by Renny Harlin (``Cliffhanger'').
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, director Andy Tennant (``Ever After'')
delivers his epic at an unhurried but engaging pace, letting us
take in the costumes and the scenery. The movie was shot in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Foster delivers an accomplished performance, though at
times she is so clenched and proper that you don't blame the king
for wanting her to chill out. Chow manages to be both warm and
commanding. But the most powerful performance comes from Bai as the
rebellious concubine. Her tearful testimony in a courtroom
generates an emotional power that the rest of the film never
approaches. ``Anna and the King''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat. Rated PG-13 for some
intense violent sequences. At metro theaters. 2 hours, 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Maybe we didn't need another version, but this one
is handsome and engaging.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar prospects: Its best bets are in technical categories,
including cinematography, art direction and costumes.

 &HT;    Tin emotion propels `Bicentennial Man'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the re-teaming of huggy-feely actor Robin Williams and
cheese-wiz director Chris Columbus (``Mrs. Doubtfire'') gives you
early holiday indigestion, here's the good news: ``Bicentennial
Man'' is a sweet, relatively restrained bit of sci-fi schmaltz. The
story of a robot who wants to be human, it's the polar opposite of
``The Matrix'': a feel-good man-and-machine movie to bear us toward
the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Based on writings by Isaac Asimov, ``Man'' delivers a Pinocchio
for the Internet age, sprinkled with some fairy dust from ``Peter
Pan.'' Williams (in heavy makeup for half the film) plays the
android Andrew, brought into the wealthy home of the Martins. He
refers to the father (Sam Neill) as ``Sir,'' the mother (Wendy
Crewson) as ``Ma'am'' and the daughters as ``Miss'' and ``Little
Miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone but Sir finds this polite, metallic butler a little
creepy at first; the elder daughter even tries to make him
self-destruct. But Sir sees him as a steady friend, and for Little
Miss _ who grows up from Pepsi kid Hallie Kate Eisenberg into
Embeth Davidtz _ he's the next best thing to a boyfriend. Except
for the bio-mechanical boundary between them. ...
</P>
<P>
   There's another problem: time. As decades leapfrog forward,
Andrew increasingly develops human traits (creativity, curiosity
and a hint of emotion). But the people around him age, wither, die.
``Will every human being that I care for just leave?'' he asks. It
underscores the movie's gentle melancholy, which may surprise
audiences expecting a laugh-out-loud Williams comedy. The humor is
on the mild, even lame side. (Asked to be an usher at a wedding,
Andrew asks, ``How does one ush?'')
</P>
<P>
   Overlong, like most flicks this time of year, ``Man'' moves
swiftly for its first 90 minutes, but it slows down to become a
disappointingly conventional love story that isn't really
persuasive. The movie has a heart, but a flagging pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Because it spans 200 years, ``Man'' includes a lot of old-age
makeup for its actors, ranging from the passable to the very good.
Unfortunately, Columbus and his designers deliver a familiar vision
of the future. It's a place of busy cityscapes crisscrossed with
aerial vehicles, and uncomfortable-looking beds without sheets; you
expect a crew member of the Enterprise to turn up.
</P>
<P>
   There's another problem with the movie. While Andrew the android
is noble and sweet, what he lacks is exactly what is supposed to
define him: personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bicentennial
</P>
<P>
   Man''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin
</P>
<P>
   Williams, Embeth Davidtz and Sam Neill. Rated PG for language
and sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   This tin man has
</P>
<P>
   a heart, but his movie needs a pulse.

 &HT;    `House Rules': Looking for a home
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aping the beginning of ``David Copperfield'' (``Whether I shall
be the hero of my own life ...''), John Irving's film adaptation of
his lengthy, idiosyncratic novel ``The Cider House Rules'' starts
something like this: ``I had hoped to become a hero, but at St.
Cloud's there was no such position. So I have been a caretaker of
many and father of none. Except one.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker is Dr. Wilbur Larch (a lovely performance by Michael
Caine), patriarch of St. Cloud's orphanage in Maine, where, in the
late 1930s and early '40s, he presides over a passel of unwanted
children. Pregnant women come to St. Cloud's for help, and Dr.
Larch provides it. Their choice: a delivery or an abortion (illegal
at the time, thus resulting in many botched home operations
performed by a desperate girl with a knitting hook).
</P>
<P>
   The ``exception'' whom Larch refers to is Homer Wells (Tobey
Maguire), ``twice adopted, twice returned.'' So Homer grows up at
St. Cloud's becoming the doctor's medical apprentice and, more
importantly, his surrogate son.
</P>
<P>
   In the picture's first, better half, we see how life at St.
Cloud's works. How Homer respects Larch while disagreeing with him
about abortion. How the orphans eye the prospective adoptive
parents as eagerly as puppies in a pet shop. How Larch allows
himself one unfortunate indulgence: an addiction to ether. And how
he puts his charges to bed every night with a little ``David
Copperfield'' (an ongoing motif) and the benediction, ``Good night,
you princes of Maine! You kings of New England!''

   In the second, not-so-good half, Homer takes off with a
glamorous couple who've come to use Dr. Larch's services. They're
Candy (Charlize Theron, who surely must have the whitest teeth in
show biz) and her pilot boyfriend, Wally. While Wally is in the
service, Candy teaches Homer about picking apples, trapping
lobsters and what to do at a drive-in, especially when there's no
movie on the screen. Homer also becomes friendly with the migrant
apple pickers, led by the ebullient Rose (Delroy Lindo), whose
deceptive relationship with his daughter (singer Erykah Badu)
creates a moral crisis for Homer.
</P>
<P>
   To say that this is the best of the Irving movie adaptations is
to damn it with faint praise. After all, consider the competition:
the spirited but uneven ``The World According to Garp,'' the
unstable and ultimately hopeless ``The Hotel New Hampshire'' and
the gooey ``Simon Birch,'' which Irving disowned.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Irving purists will find that he has jettisoned
half of his book and pared the narrative down to what he feels is
important. What remains, however, is that distinctively Irving
sense of cosmic tragedies colliding with comic incidents. Things
don't just happen in ``The Cider House Rules''; they happen. With
major consequences. The lesson is that some rules matter and some
don't, and growing up is often a matter of realizing the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Irving is lucky in his cast _ especially Caine and Lindo as the
flawed father figures. He's doubly lucky in his director, Lasse
Hallstrom. As he demonstrated in ``My Life as a Dog'' and ``What's
Eating Gilbert Grape,'' Hallstrom has an affinity for displaced
children. This heartfelt movie suggests that we are all, in a
sense, displaced children, searching for somewhere to belong and
the heroism to take command of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider
</P>
<P>
   House Rules''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine and Tobey Maguire. Directed by Lasse
Hallstrom. Rated PG-13 for mature thematic elements, sexuality,
nudity, substance abuse and violence.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The author adapted it, so the movie plays by his
rules.

 &HT;    A devilish, bloody `Ride' into America's paradox
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ang Lee works like the devil to put over ``Ride With the
Devil,'' his fervent, oddly gallant film about the fringes of the
Civil War. And more often than not, he succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Not an easy task, not even for the director of such disparate
movies as ``The Ice Storm'' and ``Sense and Sensibility.'' Based on
Daniel Woodrell's Civil War novel ``Woe to Live On,'' ``Devil'' is
as random, sprawling and piecemeal as the skirmishes it records.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time in the Midwest, there were the pro-North
Jayhawkers and the pro-South Bushwackers. Together, they spent most
of the war tearing up the border states of Kansas and Missouri.
Their ``war'' was more like a guerrilla gang action _ Crips and
Bloods on horseback. They lacked both uniforms and leaders. What
they didn't lack was hate.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Boedel (Tobey Maguire) and Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich)
are best friends from decidedly different backgrounds. Jake comes
from sturdy German mercantile stock; his shopkeeper father, like
most of his ilk, supports the Union. Jack Bull is Southern through
and through; like his agrarian parents, he supports the
Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no brother-against-brother tale. Rather, Jake
embraces the Southern cause as fervently as his pal. Joining George
Clyde (Simon Baker), the sort of aristocrat who looks as if he
might have gone to school with Ashley Wilkes, and Daniel Holt
(Jeffrey Wright), Clyde's best friend and freed slave, they all
enlist with the Bushwackers. Eventually, they ride with Quantrill's
Raiders into Lawrence, Kan., and participate in what some
historians call the worst act of mass murder in our nation's
history (at least 150 dead civilians).
</P>
<P>
   The carnage in Lawrence is the picture's bloody centerpiece and
its moral fulcrum. But most of the movie takes place in fits and
starts. A confrontation at a farmstead is courteously interrupted
so the women and children can leave before the shooting and burning
continue. A wintry retreat in what amounts to little more than a
hole in the ground gives the four men a chance to know one another
better; it also introduces them to a broad-browed young widow
(singer Jewel in a credible acting debut).
</P>
<P>
   Like another film master, John Ford, Lee is fascinated by the
contrast between our country's blood lust and its need to settle
down, between carnage and domesticity. The characters speak in a
kind of stilted, homespun, old-fashioned dialogue that somehow
forces us to listen to them more closely. One moment we hear Jake's
idealism and sense of honor; the next we hear his racism.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Lee contrasts our four young believers with those for
whom mayhem is a way of life: professional killers such as Black
Jack (James Caviezel) or psychos like Pit Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys
Meyers). Here are the seeds of Columbine High School and the
Atlanta brokerage office shootings, the all-too-American taste for
waving weapons as easily as unfurling flags. At the same time, Lee
shows us the myriad kindnesses of the nonwarriors, the ones who
risk their lives and their land simply by offering a hot meal.
</P>
<P>
   For some, ``Devil'' will seem ultimately too scattered, too
lacking in dramatic buildup and focus. Others may find it a sublime
contemplation of the American character at a particularly revealing
time in our struggle to become a nation. One contradictory image
says it all: a newborn contentedly suckling the stub of a youth's
finger blown off during the war. An oddly hearty welcome for a
Johnny who has finally marched home for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ride With
</P>
<P>
   the Devil''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tobey Maguire, Skeet Ulrich and Jewel. Directed by Ang
Lee. Rated R for graphic war violence. At metro theaters. 2 hours,
14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Worth the ride.

WINONA, INTERRUPTED: REAL-LIFE MENTAL ILLNESS SHAPES RYDER'S
ON-SCREEN PERFORMANCE

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Winona Ryder in
a scene from ``Girl, Interrupted.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In her powerful new film ``Girl, Interrupted,'' Winona Ryder
plays a young woman who, after her first visit to a psychiatrist,
is heavily drugged and locked up for two years in a mental
institution.
 &HT;    It's a sad, shocking story _ all the more so for being based on
fact _ but it would seem to be a million miles from anything the
popular, 28-year-old actress could know anything about.
 &HT;    But appearances can be deceiving. Ryder, star of films such as
``Beetlejuice (1988), ``Mermaids'' (l990), ``Little Women'' (1994)
and ``Alien Resurrection'' (1997), has known some of those same
experiences firsthand.
 &HT;    ``I could have been that woman,'' Ryder says, ``and so I
strongly identified with what she went through. I too have been a
patient in a mental hospital and have suffered from depression,
panic and anxiety attacks.''
 &HT;    At one point, she adds, she felt ``too sensitive to be living in
the world.''
 &HT;    The slender actress, who has specialized in playing troubled
teen-agers, talked frankly about her own emotional problems on the
eve of the film's Los Angeles opening on Dec. 21 _ it will open
nationwide on Jan. 14 _ because, she says, she wants to help other
young women who may find themselves in the same boat.
 &HT;    ``Girl, Interrupted'' is based on Susanna Kaysen's best-selling
1993 memoir about a group of teen-age girls in a New England mental
hospital. Ryder plays the author, who in the late 1960s was
diagnosed as suffering from borderline-personality disorder.
 &HT;    Ryder read Kaysen's work after her own breakdown, and was
shocked and then delighted to discover that she wasn't unique and,
in fact, that her own life had a great deal in common with the
author's nightmarish experiences.
 &HT;    ``Susanna saw a psychiatrist for 20 minutes,'' the actress says,
``and then she was locked up for two years.''
 &HT;    One of the most successful stars of her generation, Ryder would
seem to have the world in her hands. She keeps company with
Oscar-winning writer/actor Matt Damon, best known for ``Good Will
Hunting'' (l997). She lives in a $2.5 million, four-bedroom Beverly
Hills estate, and is a fixture on lists of the most beautiful women
in the world.
 &HT;    But the waifish actress admits that, by the time she was l9, she
was having horrible anxiety attacks which eventually culminated in
a full-fledged breakdown.
 &HT;    The pressure was unrelenting, she recalls. She was working
nonstop while trying to cope with the breakup of her first serious
romance, with Johnny Depp, her co-star in ``Edward Scissorhands''
(1990). And their shattered relationship was being played out on
front pages around the world.
 &HT;    ``I grew up in front of everybody,'' the actress says. ``I got
my first pimples on film, I went through puberty on film and even
had my first period, literally, on film. At the time my boyfriend
was an actor, and everything we did together was photographed and
endlessly written about. My whole life was amplified for public
consumption.
 &HT;    ``And every time I complained about it,'' she adds, ``I was
called a brat. So I learned I wasn't supposed to complain about
anything _ the message was that we were perfect people who led
perfect lives.
 &HT;    ``Of course that's not true.''
 &HT;    Gradually her anxiety attacks, fueled by her bottled-up
frustrations, became more severe.
 &HT;    ``My heart would be thumping at 90 miles an hour and I'd be
sweating,'' she recalls. ``I was l9, felt totally alone and felt I
couldn't tell anybody in the world how I was feeling. It's horrible
and scary not to be able to describe that terror. You're on a plane
and you want desperately to get off. So you turn to the stranger in
the next seat and you want to say something, but you don't know
what you want to say.''
 &HT;    Ryder says she had no idea what was happening to her. Finally,
desperate, she checked herself into a mental hospital for a week.
 &HT;    ``It was scary,'' she recalls, ``and a lot like the hospital
wing in `Girl Interrupted.'''
 &HT;    Eventually, Ryder says, she learned that she had to help
herself.
 &HT;    ``No matter how rich you are,'' she says, ``no matter how much
you pay some hospital or doctor, they can't fix you. They can't
give you a secret answer to anything that's going to make you all
better. You have to figure it out for yourself.''
 &HT;    When she learned to talk about her attacks to friends, she adds,
she discovered many of them had experienced similar symptoms,
including her ``Girl, Interrupted'' co-star Brittany Murphy. Only
then did she begin to be able to control her episodes of panic.
 &HT;    ``Over the years I got a response from other women who were also
grateful to know that they were not alone,'' she says. ``For me,
reading Susanna's book when I was 21 showed me that what happened
to me wasn't so unusual. I discovered that these are feelings that
we all have _ it's not just an isolated incident that happens to
one girl.
 &HT;    ``In America,'' she adds, ``I know it's something that's
sweeping the country. It's about the loneliness that we all go
through.''
 &HT;    Like her, Ryder says, many women keep their problems hidden for
as long as they can.
 &HT;    ``You get scared you're not going to be able to control it,''
she explains. ``I have now made a conscious choice to talk about
it, although as actors we have a rough time if we mention we're
going through a depression. We get slammed and called utter brats.
 &HT;    ``We're told we should be grateful for everything,'' Ryder says.
``And it's true, I live a very privileged life. We're sickeningly
well paid, get these amazing bonuses and have these very charmed
lives.
 &HT;    ``But I also have the same pressures that any other human being
has, only amplified because of the work I've chosen to do and
because our lives are a lot more public.''
 &HT;    Reading ``Girl, Interrupted'' convinced Rider to produce a movie
version, and to star in it as well.
 &HT;    ``I was so drawn to this character,'' she says. ``She was so
brutally honest about herself without being self-indulgent _ that's
pretty rare in literature, especially for a female character. She
also kept a journal, and so do I.''
 &HT;    But it wasn't an easy movie to get made. Hollywood was hardly
enraptured over the prospect of what some called ``an all-girl
`Cuckoo's Nest.''' It took six years for the cameras to roll _ long
enough that Ryder was beginning to feel that she might be too old
to play a teen-ager.
 &HT;    Aided by her slight frame and youthful face, she pulls it off _
no surprise, since she admits that she'd have done almost anything
to play the role. Long at her best in moody, troubled roles, Ryder
complains that, when it thinks of movies for female audiences or
meaty roles for actresses, Hollywood is more inclined to make
softer, romantic ``popcorn movies'' such as ``Runaway Bride''
(1999).
 &HT;    ``I'm not out to badmouth that film,'' she says, ``but most of
what is offered to young women in film is terrible _ it's really an
insult. Most films don't raise issues or bring good conversation to
the table.
 &HT;    ``We need to start offering women something they can relate
to.''

 &HT;    In London, tea for two with Uncle Cheap
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 19.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Nearly all her life, she had been promised a trip to
Europe. We had planned on Paris for her 16th birthday, but we ended
up at Barnsley Gardens in northwest Georgia. Now we were at
Tiger-Tiger, a ridiculously popular disco just a few steps from
Leicester Square, the most frenzied tourist magnet in all of
London.
</P>
<P>
   My niece Renee, a freshman from South Georgia College in
Douglas, Ga., who spent the fall semester at the University of
London, was yukking it up with two of her classmates. Imagine three
18-year-old Georgia peaches done up in their best Felicity Shagwell
outfits. Fresh off the plane, I was jet-lagged, wobbly, just trying
to keep a grip. And I was about to discover that family
resemblances are sometimes more than skin deep.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   First, an audacious young blade sidled up to our table to
inquire as to whom exactly I might be. ``No, I'm not her father,''
I sniffed. ``I'm her uncle!''
</P>
<P>
   Then, trying to make small talk with one of Renee's friends,
Jennifer, I mentioned that I'd changed planes in Newark to get a
cheap fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheap? Is this where you get that from, Renee?'' said
Jennifer, a wholly sweet, wholly innocent young lady who plans to
be a veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   How rich.
</P>
<P>
   You see, I'm the sort of guy who'll share a hotel bathroom so as
to have pocket money for cocktails, theater tickets, tea at the
Dorchester Hotel _ and $200 Chinese dinners for two. I operate on a
student's mentality, a journalist's salary and a diet that's high
in calories.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Renee paid for her five-week, $3,500 ``semester''
by waiting tables at Ruby Tuesday's in Douglas, baby-sitting and
lobbying hard for cash graduation gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Her credo was ``London or Bust.'' Mine was: ``Bust a Gut in
London.''
</P>
<P>
   By hook or by crook, on little more than our common genes and a
prayer, we made it. And if we can make it in London _ one of the
world's most expensive cities _ we can make it anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   So while Renee studied art, psychology and Brit lit, I slept
late, went to galleries, sought out weird places to eat and checked
out Soho's pubs and coffee bars. While she went to hear the
Counting Crows, I went to see Vanessa Redgrave in Noel Coward's
``Song at Twilight'' at the Gielgud Theatre. While she took exams,
I went to Evensong at Westminster Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   We were so independent, yet so in touch, that we virtually
bumped into each other one day as we rounded a corner near the
British Museum. ``Wanna go get some fish and chips?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   We never ventured to Jane Austen's cottage at Chawton or the
Lake District. But I found a Bloomsbury room with a view _ and got
to see the likenesses of some of my favorite writers (Iris Murdoch,
the Brontes, A.S. Byatt) at the National Portrait Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   And at night, we splurged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wendell and I are having fun,'' Renee wrote her grandmother on
a postcard cutout of Queen Elizabeth II's bespectacled visage.
``Maybe I'll take him out dancing _ if I can get him out of the
restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   We penned the note at the North Sea Fish Restaurant as we
polished off those fish and chips, which we both thought were the
best we found in London.
</P>
<P>
   Always an England
</P>
<P>
   How can three young women sleep when all London beckons?
</P>
<P>
   Devon Jackson, Jennifer Deen, Renee Brock: It's your night of
nights! These girls had just one week left _ and they were
determined to make the most of it. And after a few pitchers of
various hues at Tiger-Tiger, it was Three Sheets to the Wendell
(you'll pardon the pun).
</P>
<P>
   We drank, we laughed, we danced.
</P>
<P>
   I heard about their side trips to Paris, Ireland and Scotland,
about the meningitis scare. ``We paid some stupid doctor (British
pound)36 to tell us we had bedbugs,'' said Jennifer, in that
wonderful way she has of getting right to the heart of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The girls told me they refused to talk to any guy who couldn't
do a shagadelic Austin Powers imitation. And over a pitcher of ...
Seabreezes, I believe ... we even saw a birthday soiree for which
the young honoree had donned a tiara and a tiny purse, as if to
remind us that there'll always be an England.
</P>
<P>
   Late that night, I took the tube back to the frumpy St.
Margaret's Hotel near Russell Square in Bloomsbury, where I'd
checked in earlier that day. Even with its weird plumbing and
toasty smell, I liked the dowdy old walk-up, just a short stroll
from the British Museum. My room had a view of the Duke of
Bedford's back yard, and downstairs there were pictures of the day
the queen took tea in the garden. At $75 a night, it was a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The next afternoon, I met the girls in Camden Town, a maze of
outdoor markets, storefronts and cheap restaurants. ``Very Little
Five Points,'' Devon said. When she stopped to buy a slice of pizza
($1.70), the sidewalk vendor stretched out to press his
sauce-covered hands around her Botticelli-like hair.
</P>
<P>
   Renee had wanted to take me to tea at Harrod's, but it was
closed on the Sunday afternoon we dropped by. So we went to Harvey
Nichols, the somewhat fancier Knightsbridge department store next
door, where Patsy and Edina often had lunch in ``Absolutely
Fabulous.'' Upstairs at Yo! Sushi, we sat at the bar and grabbed a
few bites off the conveyor belt and ordered a few more off the
menu.
</P>
<P>
   Then we hiked up to the Dorchester to take afternoon tea in the
lobby of the magnificent hotel built in 1931 across from Hyde Park.
But first, we had champagne at the bar _ a splendid room of
mirrored ceilings and polished wood the color of pistachio shells.
While we were perched there, a woman returned to look for a diamond
bracelet she'd lost. This, after all, is a place where Alfred
Hitchcock and Elizabeth Taylor once stayed.
</P>
<P>
   We read in our guidebook that the Sultan of Brunei owns the
place, so when a sheik walked past in full regalia, we let our
imaginations run wild. We spent $135 for champagne, tea, sandwiches
and pastries. As Renee and her group would say, we were ``sconed''
_ that's the word they coined to mean ``full.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was nothing compared with our dinner at Fung Shing, a
Cantonese restaurant in Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   Hands down, it was one of the best Chinese meals of my life _ so
good that I made a return visit before leaving London. Talk about a
banquet. Over two visits, we tried _ and loved _ slices of tender
suckling pig sauced with just a hint of star anise; pan-sauteed
oysters with ginger and scallions; whole fried sea bass in a pool
of sweet-hot chili sauce; tubes of squid stuffed with seafood on a
pile of fried garlic slivers. But our favorite dish was the whole
lobster whacked into pieces and tossed with garlicky buttered
noodles.
</P>
<P>
   Was this worth changing planes in Newark? Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   Renee's dining pick was Wagamama, an Asian noodle bar near the
British Museum that opened in 1992 and had a major role in the
noodle craze that ate the Western world. At about $10 for a big
steaming bowl of ramen with miso broth and chicken, it was a
bargain. I went for the spiky bowl of chili beef noodles with lime
(about $12). Renee became a regular, and even bought the cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   Happiness by the pound
</P>
<P>
   The real question wasn't how many pounds I spent, but how many I
gained. Even Renee _ who normally wears a size 2 _ put on a few
ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Before she left, she bought my brother, Wade, a T-shirt that
said: ``My daughter went to London, and all I got was this stupid
T-shirt.'' She bought her grandmother a CD of the Westminster Abbey
choir. When I went to visit my mom recently, she couldn't get the
CD to work in her car, so I went out to help her. And as she drove
slowly out of the driveway, I heard the music: ``Hark the Herald
Angels Sing.''
</P>
<P>
   It took me right back to London, somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Renee and I always knew we were boon companions, but this trip
sealed the friendship. When she makes good on her dream to become a
medical doctor, I hope she'll remember poor Uncle Wen.
</P>
<P>
   And Jennifer, hon, don't worry about it now. But when you've
become a veterinarian, and paid off your college loans, remember
that (British pound)5 ($8.50) I loaned you in London.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. With interest, that will be . ...
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE
</P>
<P>
   Airfares are competitive, so it pays to check around. Delta _
and several other airlines _ currently offer a $439 round-trip fare
for Jan. 3-March 31 travel. Sale ends Jan. 6. 1-800-241-4141.
</P>

 &HT;    Paris in 48-hours
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 19.
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The three-hour trip from London to Paris on a 186-mph
bullet train set the tone for the next two days in the City of
Light.
</P>
<P>
   We had to be fast, direct and efficient if we were to see
everything we wanted to see.
</P>
<P>
   Paris can be explored in less than 48 hours and without spending
a lot of money, but you have to have a sense of adventure. Planning
is necessary, of course, but so is flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Planning the trip
</P>
<P>
   For our first trip to France _ or anywhere requiring a passport
_ my friend and I armed ourselves with a very limited understanding
of French, our ATM cards, two guidebooks and maps of the Paris
streets and subway. We were two rookies in a country where we
barely understood the language, but we could ask about prices,
understand directions and order from a menu.
</P>
<P>
   We booked a cheap flight to London _ $198 plus taxes _ where we
stayed with a friend before boarding the Eurostar, bound for Paris,
long before daybreak.
</P>
<P>
   We had reserved our seats on the high-speed train,
affectionately known as ``the Chunnel,'' by going online to
www.eurostar
</P>
<P>
   .com. Before leaving the United States, we'd also checked Web
sites that provide restaurant and hotel prices and amenities
(conveniences should never be assumed in France).
</P>
<P>
   Nice surprises
</P>
<P>
   Once in Paris, we reminded ourselves to be flexible and open to
any opportunity. As a result, we found friends everywhere: the
elderly woman who tried to help us find our way even though she
spoke no English; the French security officer who spent a few hours
interpreting for us and showing us around a street market of art,
flowers, fresh cheeses and produce; the Georgia couple we met at a
wine store who greeted us with, ``Where y'all from?''
</P>
<P>
   Our only requirement was finding a clean bed in which to sleep.
Anything more would be considered a luxury. We landed at the
Residence les Gobelins, a tiny place on a side street in the Latin
Quarter, in a quaint $65-a-night hotel room that had a private
bath, a telephone and a television.
</P>
<P>
   Once settled in our almost luxurious lodgings, we began plotting
our route on the street and subway (the Metro) maps, numbering our
destinations in the order we wanted to see them. Mindful of how
much time it took to get from one place to another, we tried to
organize our routes so there would be minimal, if any,
backtracking. Our goal was to use straight lines, but eventually
circle back to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Though we wanted at least a few Paris taxi experiences, for the
most part we walked. Walking gave us better, longer looks at places
we did not plan to enter, such as the Eiffel Tower and Shakespeare
&AMP; Co. Bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   When time was short, we lined up at marked taxi stands _ the
only place to get cabs _ or pulled out our stash of Metro passes.
</P>
<P>
   We were armed with change for the pay toilets located along
sidewalks, which also are dotted with artists, flower stands and
fruit vendors. We also had credit and ATM cards to draw on as
needed, which gave us a better exchange rate than we would have
found had we swapped dollars for francs before leaving the States.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite places
</P>
<P>
   We started our Paris adventure on the roof of the Samaritaine, a
department store near Pont Neuf, which translates as ``new
bridge,'' even though it is the oldest in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   From the ninth-floor roof, we were treated to a 360-degree
unobstructed view of Paris _ one best seen at night but still
beautiful in the sunlight. There was no charge to go to the roof.
Store personnel politely directed the steady stream of tourists to
elevators that go to the base of a narrow, twisting staircase to
the top.
</P>
<P>
   Next was Notre Dame. There is no charge to get inside, though
there are boxes for donations if visitors decide to light candles
in remembrance of loved ones. Taking pictures is allowed, and
there's plenty to photograph. The outside _ with carvings of the
Apostles, the Last Supper and depictions of Paradise and hell _ is
just as breathtaking as the inside. Under a ceiling 115 feet high,
light seeps in through stained glass windows of scenes from the Old
and New Testaments and of madonna and child. Long hallways are
lined with arched doorways that lead to shrines with candlelight
illuminating the statues. There are choir lofts and private areas
for prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame also is a repository for religious artifacts and
sacred silver and for fragments believed to have come from Jesus'
cross, as well as the crown of thorns and the nails that held
Christ to the cross.
</P>
<P>
   Another stop that invoked reverence was the Orsay Museum. Even
with a relatively small entrance fee _ $6 to $7, depending on
exchange rate _ there was no wait to get inside and no crowds to
see Renoir's ``Dance Garden on the Butte Montmartre'' or Degas'
``Ladies Bathing.'' ``Whistler's Mother'' also was here, along with
the works of Monet, van Gogh and Cezanne. The Orsay was easy to
tour and understand, with recorded self-tours and written
explanations _ in various languages, including English _ beside
each work.
</P>
<P>
   The Louvre Museum, another famous destination, is huge and could
be an all-day commitment. But we had specific pieces in mind _ the
Venus de Milo, the Winged Victory of Samothrace and the Mona Lisa _
so we were in at 4:30 p.m. and out before the 5:30 closing. The
charge is $6 to $7, depending on exchange rate, after 3 p.m. and on
Sundays, which is almost half the regular price.
</P>
<P>
   I had seen these works of art in books, but to view them in
person was a completely different experience _ inspiring an awe
that reduced every conversation to a whisper. Visitors can get
close enough to feel the texture of paint or the smoothness of the
sculptures, but the magnificence of these masterworks made even the
urge to touch unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   It was sunny and warm when we left the Louvre and walked past
the Place de la Concorde, where dozens of children encircled a
large fountain, using sticks to guide their miniature sailboats. A
place once known for death _ Marie Antoinette, King Louis XVI and
Robespierre lost their heads here _ the Place de la Concorde is
marked with a 75-foot Egyptian obelisk, covered with hieroglyphics,
between two ornate fountains.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to meet a boat that would take us up and down the
River Seine, we saw a bridge and small sculpture, ``The Flame of
Liberty,'' that recently have become unofficial monuments to
Princess Diana. Standing in somber silence despite the traffic
noise, people leave notes and flowers marking the spot where the
princess' life was cut short.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons to return
</P>
<P>
   At sunset, as the city lights were coming on, we began a
70-minute ride on the Seine (several companies offer such boat
tours) on a Bateaux-Mouches _ at a cost of about $10 _ that took us
under ornate bridges and past government buildings, a smaller
version of the Statue of Liberty and an illuminated Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   No trip would be complete without a walk up the Champs-Elysees,
the street that Allied troops took to the Arc de Triomphe to
celebrate their World War II victory. The sidewalks lining the
boulevard _ one of the most famous in the world _ were crowded with
tourists and Parisians out for a stroll, tempted by the seemingly
endless open cafes and ice cream shops.
</P>
<P>
   In our two days, we sampled plenty of wine and bread and butter
and cheese _ all the things for which Paris is famous. But soft
drinks are expensive _ at $5, pricier than a glass of wine or the
chocolate souffle we ordered _ and they don't come with ice.
</P>
<P>
   Even though time was short, we saw everything we wanted to see
and still had some leisure moments to eat eclairs and drink coffee
at a sidewalk table.
</P>
<P>
   If given a second chance, we'd do it all over again _ with a
whole new game plan befitting seasoned Paris visitors like us.

 &HT;    Oases of silence becoming harder to come across
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 19.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the December cold, midnight Mass was more than a gathering of
the faithful. It was always the quietest service of the year,
despite the hushed excitement that accompanied congregants into a
vestibule fragrant with the smell of frankincense and candle wax.
It was what Roman Catholics call a High Mass, longer and more
formal in its liturgy, but on Christmas it was without the usual
Sunday sermon.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin liturgy was audible, but for the most part it was a
ceremony conducted in silence. You could commune with your maker,
uninterrupted by human voices.
</P>
<P>
   Adjacent to the altar, Fraser firs 10 foot tall were strung with
blue lights, nothing more, and the simplicity was eloquent in its
own way. In recent years I've been trying to sell my children on
the idea of a Christmas tree with just blue lights _ no silver
bells, no gingerbread men, no drummer boys or peppermint canes _
but no one's buying it. They want blinking lights of every color
(except pink), and a tree hung heavy with ornamentation.
</P>
<P>
   And they want a lot of noise and chatter, as children should.
They want the sounds of the season, as most of us do.
</P>
<P>
   They are not yet into reverence or reflection, and would not
think to associate either of those with Christmas or with prayer. I
am not in the best position to be instructing others on prayer, not
having said enough of my own. But it was from the midnight Masses
of my childhood that I came to identify devotion with silence.
</P>
<P>
   And not just devotion. Call it what you wish _ relief or
respite, sanctuary or sanity _ quietude is the undervalued state in
a world that likes noise for the sake of noise. The sounds of
silence, to paraphrase Simon and Garfunkel, are the sounds we try
to quell because they remind us of loneliness, emptiness,
purposelessness. Driving to work, we replace them with Neal Boortz
jabbering on about anything and nothing; in the evening, we are no
sooner in the door than we turn on the TV, proof that we are not
alone when, deep down, we know we are.
</P>
<P>
   A little solitude goes a long way
</P>
<P>
   Even those of us who at the end of the day want nothing more
than to be alone _ to soak in a tub, sip a drink or just sit back _
do not want it for long. An hour is divine; a day and it brings on
a certain dread. We are sociable creatures, most of us, and we want
company.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is perfectly understandable, but Barbara Brown
Taylor, who teaches philosophy and religion at Piedmont College in
Demorest, believes God speaks through his silence. It is in the
interstitial space in our lives that we come to a sense of
something not just beyond ourselves but beyond the words that wash
over us every waking minute.
</P>
<P>
   In lectures at the Yale Divinity School two years ago, Taylor
spoke _ the irony is understood _ on God's reticence. Her lectures,
reprinted in a slim volume titled ``When God Is Silent,'' are as
poetic as Anne Morrow Lindbergh's ``Gift From the Sea'' and as wise
as Ben Franklin's autobiography in their everyday common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fewer and fewer oases of silence in our noisy
world,'' Taylor writes. ``Communication has higher value for us
than contemplation. Information is in greater demand than
reflection. There was a time when only doctors wore pagers and the
only person who carried a telephone around with him was the
president of the United States, in case of nuclear attack. Now we
are all that important. We can be found anywhere, at anytime, by
anyone who needs us. When a pager goes off in a room full of
people, a banner unfurls above the wearer's head: I am necessary. I
am involved in something so urgent it cannot wait.''
</P>
<P>
   An eternal tussle with silence
</P>
<P>
   I was reading this the other morning at Starbucks, a kind of
chapel in my irregular religious life. Beside me a guy had both
elbows propped on the table and his cell phone jammed to his ear. I
don't eavesdrop, but it was no emergency. Maybe it was his honey,
maybe it was his bookie. Whoever it was, sitting quietly with his
coffee was more than the man could bear.
</P>
<P>
   We are as ambivalent about silence as we are about solitude.
Speech, Carlyle wrote in ``Sartor Resartus,'' is of time; silence
is of eternity. Even the night sounds _ a refrigerator's hum, a
furnace's recurrent shutting off and coming back on _ assure us
that everything is working. With machines, as Taylor writes,
silence means malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   It is different with people, for whom silence is a void to be
feared, to be filled at all cost. Do preachers preach because the
faithful would otherwise be in the dark? Better, sometimes, that we
let silence speak, in church and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Taylor writes, ``I think we do all the talking
because we are afraid that God won't. Or, conversely, that God
will.''

<P>
   Last year for the holidays, the Tunkis family flew to Texas from
California and the Midwest for its annual get-together at the
family ranch in Bandera.
</P>
<P>
   The native Texans had a great reunion, but this fall the women
of the family decided to do it one better. They left husbands,
children, jobs and ringing phones for massages, afternoon teas,
shore excursions and an all-female gabfest aboard the luxurious
Crystal Cruise's Harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sisters of the Sea,'' they called themselves, as they sailed
through the Panama Canal to ports in Mexico, Central America and
the United States. ``This is our second cruise together. We had
such a good time on our first cruise , we couldn't wait to do it
again. We're cruising into the next phase of our lives,'' says
Peggy Tunkis of Sonoma, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The women, including Tunkis' aunt, Quita Mathis of Corpus
Christi, Texas, are eager to cruise yet another time, but with only
two cruises under their belts, the Tunkises will have to work hard
to catch up with some other repeat cruisers on the Crystal Harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Take Viola Chien of Houston, who, on the same ship, was on her
20th Crystal Cruise . If you add it all up, she says, she and her
husband, a retired doctor, have ``spent 1,000 days on cruise ships.
We took our first cruise _ a short one _ years ago. We loved it. So
as soon as my husband retired, we started cruising whenever we
could.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chiens normally cruise on Crystal two to three months a
year. ``Our favorite way is to take one long cruise in the winter.
You pack for a cruise, then put in two more dresses and three more
blouses and you can stay as long as you want,'' the experienced
cruiser says.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory is you clean out the refrigerator and stop the
newspaper. You might as well stay away as long as you want.''
</P>
<P>
   When they were younger, the Chiens enjoyed ``late buffets and
then a few dances after that,'' as well as exploring ports of call
when the cruise ship docked. These days, they enjoy the relaxing
aspects of cruising, including the ability of Chien's husband to
nap when he wants. ``And now we go to bed after dinner,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you think the Chiens are ready to return home after their
cruises, one of which lasted 70 days, nothing could be further from
the truth. ``We don't care if we ever get off,'' she says. ``Often
times we don't. We like sea days and all the activities.''
</P>
<P>
   For Harriet Cole of Lakewood, Colo., the October cruise on the
Crystal Harmony was her 54th. Although she loves ``Crystal's food
and service,'' she saves most of her praise for its dance program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only cruise where they have host programs because I love to
dance,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The world traveler, who has been to 50 states and Nepal, China
and the Mediterranean, among numerous other countries, says she
sticks with Crystal because ``it's the best line that I have been
on. It's like old-home week. I run into all these people I know,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   According to Crystal Cruise Lines, as of mid-October, 174,759 of
their passengers were repeat cruisers, all of whom become members
of the Crystal Society. A Crystal Society black-tie cocktail party
on the Harmony honored the 200 Crystal Society members on the ship,
including one mother-daughter team from Southern California who had
come on board Sept. 8 on their 26th Crystal sailing, as well as
others who were on anywhere from their second cruise to their 20th.
</P>
<P>
   But none compare to Thorne Corse , who earlier this month left
his San Francisco home for Singapore to join the Harmony's sister
ship, the Symphony, for his 84th Crystal cruise. He planned to sail
from Singapore to Los Angeles, then to Mexico back to Los Angeles,
then around the world.
</P>
<P>
   As he was packing his four suitcases for his trip, scheduled to
end on May 4, he was hard pressed to recall how many cruises he'd
been on. ``God save us. The problem is I really don't know. We're
talking something over at least 100,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His first ``honest-to-goodness cruise'' was in the late '50s to
the Caribbean. Although he enjoyed the cruise, his work as a lawyer
kept him busy and he didn't cruise again until 1980, when, in
Europe on business, he had two weeks free.
</P>
<P>
   A Mediterranean cruise he booked to fill up the time ``pretty
much hooked me,'' he says. ``Then my wife and I cruised on Royal
Viking for many years until Crystal came along.''
</P>
<P>
   A widower today, Corse enjoys the food and entertainment aboard
the ship, but ``it's not the most important thing to me. I play
backgammon quite a lot and have a regular group with whom I play,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   And while he doesn't plan his trips to coincide with any other
repeat cruisers, he enjoys being on board with ``good friend''
Reidulf Maalen, captain of the Crystal Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I know best and am most comfortable with are the
officers and crew. Always there are other repeat passengers whom I
know and many of whom I rather like. It's my home away from home,''
Corse says.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike home, however, where you have to make your own bed, scrub
your own shower and often share table space with others, Corse has
more options. In the dining room, for example, he has a table to
himself. ``That's somewhat unusual, but 83 cruises count for
something,'' he says. And, yes, even with all those cruises under
his belt, Corse still goes through the mandatory lifeboat drill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sometimes I don't go and they don't throw me overboard,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   At the Crystal Society cocktail party where frequent cruisers
were honored, the Crystal Society hostess told the group that after
75 Crystal cruises, they were entitled to a free two-week cruise in
a penthouse with a private veranda.
</P>
<P>
   At the milestone 100-cruise level, guests get a free 14-day
cruise with a stay in the 950-square foot Crystal Penthouse,
complete with dual bathrooms, a Jacuzzi with an ocean view,
spacious living room and private butler.
</P>
<P>
   If Corse keeps going at his present rate, the cruise line better
start getting it ready.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Cruises has two ships, the Crystal Harmony and Crystal
Symphony. Itineraries range from the Panama Canal, Mexico and the
Caribbean to Asia, Europe, West Africa, Australia and the South
Pacific, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Published prices begin at $2,190. For more information, call
your travel agent, visit the Web site at www.crystalcruises.com or
call 310-785-9300.
</P>
<P>
   The Crystal Harmony navigates the locks of the Panama Canal.
Crystal Cruises was named the ``Best of the Best'' large cruise
line by the Robb Report earlier this year, and Travel and Leisure
readers rated the cruise line the ``world's No. 1 luxury travel
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   A penthouse with veranda (above) features 375 square feet of
living space for Harmony passengers. Two private restaurants,
including Kyoto and Prego offer fine-dining experiences for those
who want an intimate dinner prepared to order. Special theme
cruises, including holidays, are popular with Crystal's repeat
cruisers. The Crystal Harmony offers gala lunch buffets with
themes, such as the American Classics on the 12-day Panama Canal
cruise.

   So what is there about Crystal Cruises that makes repeat
cruisers out of so many of its passengers?
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the 10-year-old cruise line has earned an
unprecedented number of industry awards, including three
consecutive designations as ``World's Best Cruise Line'' and ``Best
Large Ship Cruise Line'' from the readers of Travel and Leisure and
Conde Nast Traveller magazine, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Crystal Cruises was named the ``Best of the Best'' large
cruise line by the Robb Report earlier this year, and Travel and
Leisure readers rated the cruise line the ``world's No. 1 luxury
travel experience,'' surpassing every other cruise line as well as
every luxury hotel and resort and worldwide destination.
</P>
<P>
   Besides themed voyages, such as the October Wine and Food
Festival from Acapulco, Mexico, to New Orleans, Health/Fitness and
Big Band/Jazz extravaganzas, the cruise line is known for its
service, gourmet dining and elegant, classic decor.
</P>
<P>
   Luxuries such as plump, oversized robes and towels, down
pillows, linens and lavish table settings, including Riedel wine
glasses are commonplace, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Like other cruise ships, the Crystal Harmony offers a dining
room where passengers take most of their meals. But two private
restaurants, Kyoto, with a Japanese menu, and Prego, with Italian,
offer fine-dining experiences for those who want an intimate dinner
prepared to order.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the 940 guests on board visit the restaurants at
least once.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, we wanted the cruise line to offer an
alternative type of cuisine. It wasn't so well received at first,
but now it's very popular,'' says Toni Neumeister, director of
culinary operations.
</P>
<P>
   Executive chef Markus Nufer says beyond the private restaurants,
there's another big difference in the food on the Crystal line.
``While other large cruise ships may have only two or three chefs _
an executive chef, a sous-chef and sometimes a pastry chef _ we
have 33-35 trained European chefs on board, and all our waiters are
European,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Although food is readily available in a variety of settings
whenever guests desire, rather than midnight buffets, the Crystal
harmony focuses on gala lunch buffets, including Cuisines of the
Sun featuring foods from Spain, France and Sicily, as well as
Morocco, Israel and Turkey. An American Classics buffet takes
passengers back to the roots of American dining, while the Asian
Cafe features the cuisines of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guests love to have the regional influences we offer them,
especially where they feel it's not safe to eat ashore,''
Neumeister says.
</P>
<P>
   On Australian cruises , for example, that means adding to the
dining room menu an offering of seared kangaroo loin with bush
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I put it on the first time, I thought we wouldn't sell
it. We had 300 side orders. One guest ordered it three times
afterward,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The broad travel experiences of the typical Crystal passenger
translate to a more sophisticated cuisine than you would normally
find on a cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe food is not about food only. It's the service, the
wine you drink with the food, the friends you sit around the table
with,'' Neumeister says.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment is upscale as well, focusing more on Broadway-type
productions than Las Vegas-style shows. Guest lecturers also offer
special insight into topics as varied as handwriting analysis and
jazz to a history of the politics of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ships with passengers numbering in the thousands, the
Harmony and Symphony, with guest capacities of 940 each, feel
tranquil and spacious, yet intimate. There's no struggling to find
a seat in the theater or long lines to get your formal photos
taken.
</P>
<P>
   And therein may lie one of the secrets of the cruise line's
success. ``We don't try to be everything to everybody,'' Neumeister
says. ``We concentrate on doing what we do well. We know what our
guests prefer and act accordingly.''

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Washington) _ Israel and Syria swapped ideas
about building confidence after a half-century of hostility
Thursday as White House-directed peace talks moved into the
dynamics of a projected Israeli pullback on the Golan Heights. The
bilateral negotiations ended about 3:15 this afternoon, and the
Israelis and Syrians moved to the White House to meet with
President Clinton. (Summary from wires) By John M. Broder. (1200

</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-ASSESS (Washington) _ Facing a phalanx of cameras during
a ceremony meant to herald the resumption of Israeli-Syrian peace
talks, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa sounded every bit
the unreconstructed foe of the Jewish homeland. Apparently, though,
al-Sharaa did not display the same muscular posture privately.
Afterward, ensconced in the Blair House, the negotiations took on a
professional tone. Each side did indeed mean business, or they
wouldn't have bothered to break a 45-month freeze in talks.
Although there may seem a puzzling inconsistency in al-Sharaa's
behavior, it actually fits a pattern in Israeli-Arab peace
negotiations. On every track, there is a private and public face to
the relationship. For each side, making peace involves juggling two
campaigns: one at the negotiating table and one on the homefront.
In actual negotiations, concessions are inevitable. But publicly,
some leaders choose to present an implacable facade as defender of
his own people's needs and rights. A news analysis by Deborah
Sontag.

<P>
   RWANDA-REPORT (United Nations) _ A strongly worded report issued
Thursday by an international panel of experts holds both U.N.
officials and leading member countries, primarily the United
States, responsible for failing to stop the genocide in Rwanda. The
report says that about 800,000 people were killed in 100 days
between April and July 1994, in a Hutu-led campaign of genocide
against Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The report portrays an
organization weak on analysis and slow to respond to accumulating
warnings in the months that preceded the attacks. The United
States, which provided minimal help and no documents to the
investigators, effectively blocked the Security Council in 1993 and
1994 from authorizing any significant action in Rwanda. On a trip
to Africa last year, President Clinton apologized for this American
inaction. By Barbara Crossette. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Pervomaiskoye, Russia) _ Scores of desperate
civilians came under fire Thursday as they tried to escape the
fighting in Grozny through a newly established humanitarian
corridor. Russian troops have begun to mount reconnaissance raids
and probes into Grozny, signaling that the battle for the city is
finally underway. Russian commanders do not plan a frontal assault
on the capital, but want instead to take Grozny back, neighborhood
by neighborhood, depending heavily on their overwhelming advantage
in firepower. By Michael R. Gordon. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-U.S. (Paris) _ Among allies, France has had for 50 years
a unique capacity to annoy Americans who may love French fries,
French wine, and sometimes even the French themselves, at least in
those rare moments when they stop their constant hammering.
Irritation at the French is running high now in Washington,
American officials there say, so President Jacques Chirac and other
high French officials here are now putting out the word that it's
time to apply a little Gallic charm to their hypersensitive
American friends. By Craig R. Whitney. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-CHILD-MURDER (London) _ The European Court of Human
Rights ruled Thursday that two 10-year-old boys who kidnapped and
killed 2-year-old James Bulger in a suburban Liverpool shopping
center in 1993 had not received a fair trial in Britain. The judges
said that the two boys, Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, had been
were too young to take part effectively in a procedure designed for
adults and that the home secretary, at the time, Michael Howard,
had erred in increasing their 8-year jail sentence to 15 years. The
boys have already served six years, and, while the European
decision does not affect their convictions, it could be the basis
for a move by their lawyers in British courts to seek their
release. By Warren Hoge. (800 words)

LIFE IN THE KITCHEN GETS EASIER, TASTIER VIA DECADES OF INNOVATION 
RESEND FOR SUSAN AT THE TRENTON, N.J., TIMES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Carol Bidwell and Natalie Haughton, Staff Writers
</P>
<P>
   As the 20th century began, cooking was hard work. There were few
things to make a housewife's life easier, and virtually everything
had to be made from scratch. Even families with modest incomes had
paid ``help'' in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Many housewives counted themselves lucky if they had running
water (yes, a pump counted) inside the house. If not, water had to
be drawn from a well. Wood had to be carried, and a fire had to be
made in the stove.
</P>
<P>
   The cow had to be milked. Coffee was ``boiled up'' in a pot on
the stove, often with a eggshell thrown in for clarity. Biscuits
had to be baked, meat and eggs fried, gravy made, jars of homemade
jam brought from the pantry.
</P>
<P>
   All this and it was only 6 a.m. And there were two more meals to
prepare that same day.
</P>
<P>
   Women's work in the early 1900s was generally in the home, and
much of it was spent growing and preparing food _ and, of course,
cleaning up afterward. Housewives were ready for new advances that
made their lives easier.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, times were prosperous despite _ or perhaps in part
because of _ Prohibition, which drove evn the law-abiding to drink
as sweet cocktails masked the taste of bathtub gin. Chinese
restaurants provided a bit of exotica. For ladies, tearooms became
popular, as did gelatin salads, the fruit-filled Lady Baltimore
cake, devil's food cake and pineapple upside-down cake. At the end
of the decade, with the stock market crash, financial havoc was
created on many fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rough financial times in the '30s, Americans loved to
socialize and found affordable ways to do it. Sunday night suppers,
tea parties and one-dish meals made entertaining inexpensive.
Gadgets such as the new electric toaster, waffle iron, percolator
and electric mixer made it fun, too.
</P>
<P>
   There were new things to cook, too: It was in this era that
zucchini and broccoli first became widely available in the United
States. Ruth Wakefield changed American snacking forever when she
chopped up chocolate and mixed it into cookie batter, creating the
first chocolate-chip cookies, which she named Toll House Cookies
after the New England inn she and her husband ran.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking methods became standardized, and assorted cookbooks
began to appear. With the opening of Route 66 between Chicago and
Los Angeles, highway eateries thrived. So did food companies, which
introduced a wealth of new products.
</P>
<P>
   In the '40s _ with the best of American food sent overseas to
soldiers and sailors doing the fighting _ those left at home had to
make do with what was left. Meat, coffee, sugar, butter, cheese and
canned goods were rationed _ if they were available at all. So
housewives _ who might have spent their days working in a defense
plant _ planted victory gardens to provide for their families.
</P>
<P>
   Basic American home cooking was the food of the day. Onl the
very rich still had servants. Patriotic housewives saved bacon fat
to use in cakes and made their own jams, jellies and pickles. With
commodities scarce, entertaining was often coffee and dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Housewives also benefited from some foods produced for GIs _
dehydrated soups, dried potatoes, canned biscuits, pudding mixes,
margarine and vegetable oils. After the war, GIs brought home a new
taste for exotic food, especially pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Things changed in the food realm. Frozen and pre-made foods
became available _ and supermarkets made shopping easier. A
prosperous future with an abundance of food _ including gourmet and
convenience foods, plus new and more exotic restaurants _ was on
the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, with World War II and the Korean War over, GI Joe
was home, his wife was back in the kitchen, and that kitchen was
often in the suburbs, where new houses were being built with
fabulous kitchens, patios and barbecues. Beef _ long before any of
us knew about cholesterol _ went on those barbecues. Add a baked
potato, a salad and garlic bread, and you had a meal as American as
apple pie. That's not to say suburbia wasn't a breeding ground for
gourmet cooks, though: Beef Stroganoff and baked Alaska were tops
on any gourmet's list of dishes to perfect.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Swanson was marketing TV dinners, complete
frozen meals the family could eat while watching television. Other
convenience and frozen foods also came into their own. Fast-food
chains got their start and boomed.
</P>
<P>
   The psychedelic '60s were a mishmash of food trends, from fast
food to spa food, from blender gazpacho to fondue, from soul food
to luaus. To really put on the dog, cooks dished up veal Orloff,
beef Wellington, rumaki andmore. With the affluence, prosperity and
jet travel of the era, foreign foods became more familiar and
accessible. Ethnic restaurants appeared in ever-increasing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The '70s, known by many as the ``me'' decade, was a time of
singles bars, mood rings, pet rocks, Earth shoes and disco, a time
when even the food had strange names, like Screaming Yellow
Zonkers, Fluffernutters and Harvey Wallbangers. Eventually, though,
dinner parties, cooking classes, nouvelle cuisine, regional
cuisine, the food processor and such trendy foods as goat cheese,
farm-fresh greens, chocolate truffles and specialty produce became
all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Crock-Pots (electric slow cookers) had moved into the kitchen,
along with bundt pans and granola. And cooks were turning out
zucchini and carrot cakes slathered with cream cheese frosting
along with crepes and quiche. Restaurant favorites were fettuccini
Alfredo, main dish salads, salad bars, ranch dressing and Kahlua.
</P>
<P>
   Americans had had enough of spa food and itty-bitty portions in
the '80s. They wanted comfort food like Mom used to make. Meatloaf
was king again, along with fried chicken, mashed potatoes (although
cooks added garlic) and pizza.
</P>
<P>
   America's power elite and baby boomers had become foodies,
wheeling and dealing over power lunches at high-priced restaurants
and becoming awed by star chefs who became celebrities at a time
when status and style were all-important.
</P>
<P>
   Grazing _ eating a bit of this and a bit of that throughout the
day _ was the ``in'' thing, and so were Cajun and Southwest
cuisine. Salsa replaced ketchup as the favorite condiment. Cooks
could find kiwi, mangoes, mesclun, free-range chickens, goat cheese
and creme fraiche in markets. Pesto was a new favorite, along with
risotto, croissants and muffins. Cholesterol-lowering oat bran made
up for all that comfort. In the home kitchen, heat-and-eat
convenience foods _ with no cooking required _ were popular.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe as a backlash to all that comfort food, in the '90s
Americans became obsessed with fat _ how much in food items and
dishes and how to reduce intake _ along with nutrition, health and
fitness. Supermarkets began devoting more shelf space to nonfat and
low-fat cookies, sour cream, cream cheese, ice cream and products
containing a new low-fat fat named Olestra as manufacturers rushed
to get in on the fat-free, reduced-fat product craze. Some were
good and found a permanent place on the shelves; others w
poor and disappointing that they disappeared quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, obesity rates soared. Other consumers were into luxury
and quality (super-premium ice creams, fine wines and cheeses, for
instance). Biscotti in an array of flavors became popular. And
bread machines, turning out custom loaves with little effort,
became the rage for home cooks. Foods that were once only available
at ethnic markets were now available in supermarkets. And now it
was possible to order groceries, talk with other cooks and find
recipes on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As you look back over the last century in food, reminisce with
this sampling of some of the most popular recipes. Depending on
your age, you may recall having eaten _ or cooked _ some of them.

   PORCUPINE MEAT BALLS
</P>
<P>
   The sort of easy, novelty recipe that appealed to cooks in the
'30s appears to have been developed during World War I as a way to
stretch meat. In ``Conservation Recipes'' (1918), compiled by the
Mobilized Women's Organizations of Berkeley and published by the
Berkeley Unit, Council of Defense Women's Committee, there is
something called Rice Meat Balls, a clear forerunner of the recipe
here, which is adapted from ``My Better Homes and Gardens Cook
Book'' (1939). The 1918 version plumps up a pound of round steak
with 1 cup crumbs and 3/4 cup rice. The Better Homes recipe
specifies beef neck, shank or plate ground to order - not readily
available today. Ground chuck has been substituted.
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup uncooked converted rice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   1 (10 1/2-ounce) can condensed tomato soup
</P>
<P>
   1 soup can water
</P>
<P>
   Using hands, mix beef, rice, salt, pepper and onion well and
shape into 1-inch balls.
</P>
<P>
   Mix tomato soup and water in a medium heavy skillet and bring to
simmering over moderate heat.
</P>
<P>
   Add meatballs, adjust heat so mixture bubbles very gently, cover
and simmer 1 hour. Serve accompanied by a crisp green salad. Makes
6 servings.

RIVER ROAD BAKED SWEET POTATOES WITH MARSHMALLOWS
</P>
<P>
   The following recipe is from ``River Road Recipes'' (1959) by
The Junior League of Baton Rouge Inc. It is more typical of the
sweet potato csseroles popular in the '50s and '60s. Often crushed
pineapple substitutes for milk, and sometimes the potatoes are
spiked with sherry.
</P>
<P>
   8 medium-size sweet potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 stick butter
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   Few dashes nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon orange juice
</P>
<P>
   Marshmallows
</P>
<P>
   Bake sweet potatoes in preheated 350-degree oven until done.
Peel hot potatoes and put through a ricer until mashed. Scald milk
and add vanilla, sugar and butter.
</P>
<P>
   To potatoes, add cinnamon, nutmeg and orange juice. Stir. Add
milk mixture to potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Layer 1/2 of potato mixture in a buttered casserole; add a layer
of marshmallows and remaining potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Bake at 350 degrees F until very hot. Add a top layer of
marshmallows and brown. Makes 8 to 10 servings. &QL;

SPAGHETTI SAUCE WITH MEATBALLS
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning (around the turn of the century),
Italian-American restaurants did not serve meatballs with their
spaghetti. These were added to satisfy America's hunger for red
meat. Of course, there are dozens of variations on the theme. But,
the best, to my mind, is this make-ahead spaghetti sauce with
meatballs, cooked up by Sharon Bates, a recipe I featured in a 1992
Family Circle article.
</P>
<P>
   MEATBALLS:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 pounds lean ground beef
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup Italian-seasoned dry bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   SAUCE:
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound hot Italian sausage, thickly sliced
</P>
<P>
   5 (14 1/2-ounce) cans stewed tomatoes, with their juice
</P>
<P>
   1 (15-ounce) can tomato puree
</P>
<P>
   1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound mushrooms, wiped clean and chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 large ribs celery, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons Italian herb seasoning
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   For Meatballs, coat a 15 1/2x10 1/2x1-inch jelly-roll pan with
nonstick cooking spray; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Using hands, mix all meatball ingredients thoroughly. Shape into
1-inch balls; arrange on pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 375-degree oven 12 to 15 minutes until
uniformly browned.
</P>
<P>
   For Sauce, brown sausages in a large heavy kettle, over
moderately high hea3t until most of drippings cook out, 8 to 10
minutes. Pour off drippings. Reduce heat to moderate, add meatballs
and all sauce ingredients and bring to a boil. Adjust heat so
mixture bubbles generously, cover and simmer very slowly for 3
hours, stirring, as needed, to prevent sticking.
</P>
<P>
   Cool mixture, ladle into food freezer containers, date, label
and store in 0 degrees F freezer. Makes 1 gallon.

FRENCH SILK PIE
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate pies began showing up in early 1900s cookbooks. This
rich and silky smooth recipe is adapted from one that first
appeared in ``Better Homes and Gardens All-Time Favorite Pies''
(1978), then reappeared in a salmonella-proof vesion in the 1996
edition of the ``Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book.''

</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter (do not substitute)

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
IMPOSSIBLE COCONUT PIE
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Bisquick published a recipe for its first ``impossible
pie'' - Impossible Coconut Pie - so named because the mixture
3formed its own crust as it baked. About 100 more ``impossible''
pie recipes were later developed.

</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MOCK APPLE PIE
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine, even during the depths of the Depression,
having crackers around, but no apples. Still, that's the period
when his recipe was developed by Ritz crackers.
</P>
<P>
   Pastry for 2-crust 9-inch pie
</P>

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FIVE-CUP AMBROSIA SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Once marshmallows and sour cream were marketed commercially,

Kraft version.
</P>
<P>
   1 cup miniature marshmallows
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dairy sour cream
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    UNSAFE AND ILLEGAL GOODS BEING OFFERED ON LINE, REGULATORS SAY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal cyber-cops are going on line to spot
illegal and unsafe goods being sold on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there are manufacturers who think that since
stores won't carry illegal merchandise they can go after consumers
on the information highway,'' Ann Brown, chairman of the Consumer
Product Safety Commission, said Thursday in a luncheon speech at
the National Press Club..
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message to them is: 'No, you can't' _ we are going after
them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown dubbed the agency's Yuletide campaign ``Operation SOS,''
which stands for safe online shopping. It comes at a time when
e-commerce is surging ahead, spurred on by the rush of holiday
gift-giving.
</P>
<P>
   Brown reported that a team of ``highly trained experts'' at her
agency has begun e-shopping undercover. They are using special
phone lines, credit cards, personal computers and shipping
addresses that cannot be traced back to the government, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous or banned products already found by the consumer
safety agency's detectives include flammable children's sleepwear,
prescription drugs that lack child-proof packaging, jackets with
drawstrings that can catch and strangle a child, mini-hammocks
intended for babies that could strangle them, and novelty cigarette
lighters designed to attract youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Brown lit a cigarette lighter in the shape of a
yellow toy car ``that absolutely would appeal to kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine?'' she said, watching the flame burn. ``This
is a cigarette lighter.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency has also found four unsafe models of a German-made
wooden toy called Selecta that was being sold on both Amazon.com
and EToys. ``It has small balls that a child under three could
choke to death on,'' Brown said. ``We recalled them.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of the Selecta toys were actually shipped before
the agency halted sales, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown advised buyers to carefully check out goods after their
shipments arrive. ``When you're in the store,'' she noted. ``you
can look for the labels, you can look to see if it has small parts
or sharp edges,'' which isn't possible when shopping on line.
</P>
<P>
   She also advised consumers to visit the agency's site on the
World Wide Web (www.cpsc.gov) to acquire updated product safety
information for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not part of Brown's regulatory portfolio, it has
also become clear that burgeoning Internet shopping poses a two-way
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Online credit card fraud alone is due to cost e-commerce
merchants at least $400 million in 1999, according to a report
released earlier this month by Meridien Research Inc. of Newton,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Internet online consumer fraud is expected to cost
online merchants upwards of $1.5 billion this year, the consulting
group found. Among the most popular scams: customers claiming
falsely they never ordered shipped items and then refusing to
return or pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Meridien predicted that by 2001, online credit card fraud could
cost merchants $9 billion a year, and that by 2003 the cost could
reach $15 billion. Fraud rates, it said, could reach 30 percent for
sites selling computer software.

<P>
   As the 20th century began, cooking was hard work. There were few
things to make a housewife's life easier, and virtually everything
had to be made from scratch. Even families with modest incomes had
paid ``help'' in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Many housewives counted themselves lucky if they had running
water (yes, a pump counted) inside the house. If not, water had to
be drawn from a well. Wood had to be carried, and a fire had to be
made in the stove.
</P>
<P>
   The cow had to be milked. Coffee was ``boiled up'' in a pot on
the stove, often with a eggshell thrown in for clarity. Biscuits
had to be baked, meat and eggs fried, gravy made, jars of homemade
jam brought from the pantry.
</P>
<P>
   All this and it was only 6 a.m. And there were two more meals to
prepare that same day.
</P>
<P>
   Women's work in the early 1900s was generally in the home, and
much of it was spent growing and preparing food _ and, of course,
cleaning up afterward. Housewives were ready for new advances that
made their lives easier.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, times were prosperous despite _ or perhaps in part
because of _ Prohibition, which drove evn the law-abiding to drink
as sweet cocktails masked the taste of bathtub gin. Chinese
restaurants provided a bit of exotica. For ladies, tearooms became
popular, as did gelatin salads, the fruit-filled Lady Baltimore
cake, devil's food cake and pineapple upside-down cake. At the end
of the decade, with the stock market crash, financial havoc was
created on many fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rough financial times in the '30s, Americans loved to
socialize and found affordable ways to do it. Sunday night suppers,
tea parties and one-dish meals made entertaining inexpensive.
Gadgets such as the new electric toaster, waffle iron, percolator
and electric mixer made it fun, too.
</P>
<P>
   There were new things to cook, too: It was in this era that
zucchini and broccoli first became widely available in the United
States. Ruth Wakefield changed American snacking forever when she
chopped up chocolate and mixed it into cookie batter, creating the
first chocolate-chip cookies, which she named Toll House Cookies
after the New England inn she and her husband ran.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking methods became standardized, and assorted cookbooks
began to appear. With the opening of Route 66 between Chicago and
Los Angeles, highway eateries thrived. So did food companies, which
introduced a wealth of new products.
</P>
<P>
   In the '40s _ with the best of American food sent overseas to
soldiers and sailors doing the fighting _ those left at home had to
make do with what was left. Meat, coffee, sugar, butter, cheese and
canned goods were rationed _ if they were available at all. So
housewives _ who might have spent their days working in a defense
plant _ planted victory gardens to provide for their families.
</P>
<P>
   Basic American home cooking was the food of the day. Onl the
very rich still had servants. Patriotic housewives saved bacon fat
to use in cakes and made their own jams, jellies and pickles. With
commodities scarce, entertaining was often coffee and dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Housewives also benefited from some foods produced for GIs _
dehydrated soups, dried potatoes, canned biscuits, pudding mixes,
margarine and vegetable oils. After the war, GIs brought home a new
taste for exotic food, especially pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Things changed in the food realm. Frozen and pre-made foods
became available _ and supermarkets made shopping easier. A
prosperous future with an abundance of food _ including gourmet and
convenience foods, plus new and more exotic restaurants _ was on
the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, with World War II and the Korean War over, GI Joe
was home, his wife was back in the kitchen, and that kitchen was
often in the suburbs, where new houses were being built with
fabulous kitchens, patios and barbecues. Beef _ long before any of
us knew about cholesterol _ went on those barbecues. Add a baked
potato, a salad and garlic bread, and you had a meal as American as
apple pie. That's not to say suburbia wasn't a breeding ground for
gourmet cooks, though: Beef Stroganoff and baked Alaska were tops
on any gourmet's list of dishes to perfect.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Swanson was marketing TV dinners, complete
frozen meals the family could eat while watching television. Other
convenience and frozen foods also came into their own. Fast-food
chains got their start and boomed.
</P>
<P>
   The psychedelic '60s were a mishmash of food trends, from fast
food to spa food, from blender gazpacho to fondue, from soul food
to luaus. To really put on the dog, cooks dished up veal Orloff,
beef Wellington, rumaki andmore. With the affluence, prosperity and
jet travel of the era, foreign foods became more familiar and
accessible. Ethnic restaurants appeared in ever-increasing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The '70s, known by many as the ``me'' decade, was a time of
singles bars, mood rings, pet rocks, Earth shoes and disco, a time
when even the food had strange names, like Screaming Yellow
Zonkers, Fluffernutters and Harvey Wallbangers. Eventually, though,
dinner parties, cooking classes, nouvelle cuisine, regional
cuisine, the food processor and such trendy foods as goat cheese,
farm-fresh greens, chocolate truffles and specialty produce became
all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Crock-Pots (electric slow cookers) had moved into the kitchen,
along with bundt pans and granola. And cooks were turning out
zucchini and carrot cakes slathered with cream cheese frosting
along with crepes and quiche. Restaurant favorites were fettuccini
Alfredo, main dish salads, salad bars, ranch dressing and Kahlua.
</P>
<P>
   Americans had had enough of spa food and itty-bitty portions in
the '80s. They wanted comfort food like Mom used to make. Meatloaf
was king again, along with fried chicken, mashed potatoes (although
cooks added garlic) and pizza.
</P>
<P>
   America's power elite and baby boomers had become foodies,
wheeling and dealing over power lunches at high-priced restaurants
and becoming awed by star chefs who became celebrities at a time
when status and style were all-important.
</P>
<P>
   Grazing _ eating a bit of this and a bit of that throughout the
day _ was the ``in'' thing, and so were Cajun and Southwest
cuisine. Salsa replaced ketchup as the favorite condiment. Cooks
could find kiwi, mangoes, mesclun, free-range chickens, goat cheese
and creme fraiche in markets. Pesto was a new favorite, along with
risotto, croissants and muffins. Cholesterol-lowering oat bran made
up for all that comfort. In the home kitchen, heat-and-eat
convenience foods _ with no cooking required _ were popular.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe as a backlash to all that comfort food, in the '90s
Americans became obsessed with fat _ how much in food items and
dishes and how to reduce intake _ along with nutrition, health and
fitness. Supermarkets began devoting more shelf space to nonfat and
low-fat cookies, sour cream, cream cheese, ice cream and products
containing a new low-fat fat named Olestra as manufacturers rushed
to get in on the fat-free, reduced-fat product craze. Some were
good and found a permanent place on the shelves; others were so
poor and disappointing that they disappeared quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, obesity rates soared. Other consumers were into luxury
and quality (super-premium ice creams, fine wines and cheeses, for
instance). Biscotti in an array of flavors became popular. And
bread machines, turning out custom loaves with little effort,
became the rage for home cooks. Foods that were once only available
at ethnic markets were now available in supermarkets. And now it
was possible to order groceries, talk with other cooks and find
recipes on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As you look back over the last century in food, reminisce with
this sampling of some of the most popular recipes. Depending on
your age, you may recall having eaten _ or cooked _ some of them.

   PORCUPINE MEAT BALLS
</P>
<P>
   The sort of easy, novelty recipe that appealed to cooks in the
'30s appears to have been developed during World War I as a way to
stretch meat. In ``Conservation Recipes'' (1918), compiled by the
Mobilized Women's Organizations of Berkeley and published by the
Berkeley Unit, Council of Defense Women's Committee, there is
something called Rice Meat Balls, a clear forerunner of the recipe
here, which is adapted from ``My Better Homes and Gardens Cook
Book'' (1939). The 1918 version plumps up a pound of round steak
with 1 cup crumbs and 3/4 cup rice. The Better Homes recipe
specifies beef neck, shank or plate ground to order - not readily
available today. Ground chuck has been substituted.
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup uncooked converted rice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   1 (10 1/2-ounce) can condensed tomato soup
</P>
<P>
   1 soup can water
</P>
<P>
   Using hands, mix beef, rice, salt, pepper and onion well and
shape into 1-inch balls.
</P>
<P>
   Mix tomato soup and water in a medium heavy skillet and bring to
simmering over moderate heat.
</P>
<P>
   Add meatballs, adjust heat so mixture bubbles very gently, cover
and simmer 1 hour. Serve accompanied by a crisp green salad. Makes
6 servings.

RIVER ROAD BAKED SWEET POTATOES WITH MARSHMALLOWS
</P>
<P>
   The following recipe is from ``River Road Recipes'' (1959) by
The Junior League of Baton Rouge Inc. It is more typical of the
sweet potato csseroles popular in the '50s and '60s. Often crushed
pineapple substitutes for milk, and sometimes the potatoes are
spiked with sherry.
</P>
<P>
   8 medium-size sweet potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 stick butter
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   Few dashes nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon orange juice
</P>
<P>
   Marshmallows
</P>
<P>
   Bake sweet potatoes in preheated 350-degree oven until done.
Peel hot potatoes and put through a ricer until mashed. Scald milk
and add vanilla, sugar and butter.
</P>
<P>
   To potatoes, add cinnamon, nutmeg and orange juice. Stir. Add
milk mixture to potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Layer 1/2 of potato mixture in a buttered casserole; add a layer
of marshmallows and remaining potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Bake at 350 degrees F until very hot. Add a top layer of
marshmallows and brown. Makes 8 to 10 servings. &QL;

SPAGHETTI SAUCE WITH MEATBALLS
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning (around the turn of the century),
Italian-American restaurants did not serve meatballs with their
spaghetti. These were added to satisfy America's hunger for red
meat. Of course, there are dozens of variations on the theme. But,
the best, to my mind, is this make-ahead spaghetti sauce with
meatballs, cooked up by Sharon Bates, a recipe I featured in a 1992
Family Circle article.
</P>
<P>
   MEATBALLS:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 pounds lean ground beef
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup Italian-seasoned dry bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   SAUCE:
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound hot Italian sausage, thickly sliced
</P>
<P>
   5 (14 1/2-ounce) cans stewed tomatoes, with their juice
</P>
<P>
   1 (15-ounce) can tomato puree
</P>
<P>
   1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound mushrooms, wiped clean and chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 large ribs celery, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons Italian herb seasoning
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   For Meatballs, coat a 15 1/2x10 1/2x1-inch jelly-roll pan with
nonstick cooking spray; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Using hands, mix all meatball ingredients thoroughly. Shape into
1-inch balls; arrange on pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 375-degree oven 12 to 15 minutes until
uniformly browned.
</P>
<P>
   For Sauce, brown sausages in a large heavy kettle, over
moderately high hea3t until most of drippings cook out, 8 to 10
minutes. Pour off drippings. Reduce heat to moderate, add meatballs
and all sauce ingredients and bring to a boil. Adjust heat so
mixture bubbles generously, cover and simmer very slowly for 3
hours, stirring, as needed, to prevent sticking.
</P>
<P>
   Cool mixture, ladle into food freezer containers, date, label
and store in 0 degrees F freezer. Makes 1 gallon.

IMPOSSIBLE COCONUT PIE
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Bisquick published a recipe for its first ``impossible

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MOCK APPLE PIE
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine, even during the depths of the Depression,
having crackers around, but no apples. Still, that's the period
when his recipe was developed by Ritz crackers.
</P>
<P>
   Pastry for 2-crust 9-inch pie

DILLY CASSEROLE BREAD
</P>
<P>
   Few Bake-Off Contest Grand Prize winners are more popular than
this one, which has become an American classic. It was the creation
of a Nebraska cook named Leona P. Schnuelle, who entered it in the
1960 Bake-Off Contest
</P>
<P>
   2 to 2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour OR unbleached flour, lightly
spooned into a measure and leveled off

   CHIP-IMPLANT _ PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Here's a high-tech tracking
device not even George Orwell envisioned: a gizmo slightly smaller
than a dime inserted under a person's skin. Palm Beach-based
Applied Digital Solutions said this week that it bought the patent
for the implant, which it calls the Digital Angel. People who use
the transmitter _ powered by the carrier's muscle _ could be
tracked by global positioning satellite, the same technology used
in some luxury cars and boats. (Ostrowski, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>
   NET-FUTURE _ As we close out one century and enter the next few
things will become as pervasive in our lives as the Internet, some
folks say. We take a look at what the future looks like from the
World Wide Web perspective. (Cocks, Austin American-Statesman). 40.

   COX-MINORITIES _ Cox has hired Images, an African-American

to begin segmenting its marketing. (Katz, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 15.
</P>
<P>
   QWEST-BELLSOUTH _ Q: This announcement about Qwest comes a week
after BellSouth's somewhat parallel deal with KPN. So just how well
is the Qwest deal working out? Qwest Communications and BellSouth
Corp. said they have won 27 multiyear contracts valued at $250
million since BellSouth purchased 10 percent of Qwest for $3.5
billion in May. Qwest, the No. 4 U.S. long-distance carrier, and
BellSouth, which sells local telephone service in nine southeastern
states, agreed to coordinate their marketing efforts when they
announced the transaction in April. They said they now have more
than 250 proposals pending with governments and retail, financial
and health-care companies, in addition to the new contracts.
(Kanell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.

agreed-upon price. (Quinn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 6.

   TEXAS-AIR _ AUSTIN, Texas _ An anti-air pollution plan that Gov.
George W. Bush says Texas could consider would likely limit the
number of trucks, sports utility vehicles and large cars that
automakers would sell in the state, according to a group of auto
manufacturers. The proposal is one of more than a dozen aimed at
getting nearly all of Texas in line with federal pollution
standards by 2007. (Elizondo, Austin American-Statesman)

 &HT;    ADAM'S MARK HOTELS NAMED IN FEDERAL RACE BIAS SUIT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department filed a federal
discrimination Thursday lawsuit against Adam's Mark Hotels and
Resorts, alleging that it violated the rights of black patrons in
its 21 hotels across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of behavior is simply unacceptable,'' Attorney
General Janet Reno said at a news conference. ``It is hard to
believe that 35 years after the Civil Rights Act was passed by
Congress, this type of discrimination still exists.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation of the hotel chain, which is owned by
HBE Corp. of St. Louis, found that minorities _ especially large
groups of blacks _ were given less desirable accommodations than
white guests, were charged more for rooms, in-room movies and hotel
bars, and had to adhere to stricter security requirements such as
wearing orange wrist bands for identification.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the actions were a clear violation of the Civil Rights
Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or
religion in public accommodations. The lawsuit against the hotel
chain would mandate changes in its alleged discriminatory
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint of inferior treatment of blacks was not isolated
to a few hotels within the chain, but was part of a corporate
policy to discourage minority patrons, said Bill Lann Lee, acting
assistant attorney general for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Kummer, president of HBE Corp., said ``we believe the facts
will prove that our conduct has reflected no bias with regard to
race or ethnicity, and that our actions were consistent with those
employed by other leading lodging companies across the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Minorities make up nearly 55 percent of HBE's employees
nationwide and about 21 percent of its supervisory and management
positions, according to Kummer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state of Florida announced it is joining in a
private lawsuit filed by disgruntled black patrons who stayed at
the Daytona Beach Adam's Mark Hotel during the ``Black College
Reunion'' in April.
</P>
<P>
   The patrons suing the Daytona Beach hotel allege that it removed
furnishings from the lobby and their rooms when they checked in,
denied them access to the main driveway in front of the hotel, and
refused to provide them with valet parking.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth, who joined Reno at the
news conference, said that in addition to the the state's
intervention in the private lawsuit, he was also filing a state
civil rights complaint against the hotel on behalf of nearly 1,200
black patrons who alleged discrimination in April.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Daytona Beach hotel, there are Adam's Mark
resorts in Orlando and Clearwater.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels across the country that were investigated included
locations in Grand Junction, Denver, and Colorado Springs, Colo.;
Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio, Texas; Winston-Salem and
Charlotte, N.C.; Columbia, S.C.; and Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's Mark hotels are also scheduled to open in Atlanta and
Jacksonville next year.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said that although a lawsuit has been filed, the
investigation will continue. The Justice Department urged
individuals who believe they were victims of discrimination or have
information on discrimination at any of the 21 Adam's Mark Hotels
to call the Housing and Civil Enforcement Section of the Civil
Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743.

<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this Imax film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska: Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big ... The sheer size of the latest
Imax offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience.
Otherwise, this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest
state is just another Discovery Channel-style nature flick. The
film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about the
ice age, the Klondike Gold Rush, caribou hunting and bears. (Bob
Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``All About My Mother'' R (profanity, sexuality, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cecilia Roth,
</P>
<P>
   Marisa Paredes,
</P>
<P>
   Penelope Cruz and Antonia San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's bad-boy filmmaker Pedro Almodovar grows up with this
humane celebration of nurturing women. ``All About My Mother'' is a
virtually male-free fable with a title inspired by that backstage
classic, ``All About Eve.'' It's a movie that can wink at its own
campy sensibility while still grabbing you by the gut. Dark and
tender, the movie beautifully balances humor and heartache. In
Spanish with subtitles. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, nudity, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   A beaut. The ever-more-remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama in this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jodie Foster
</P>
<P>
   and Chow Yun-Fat.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we didn't need another version, but this one is handsome
and engaging. Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat star in this lavish,
songless costume drama that holds its own against the beloved 1956
musical ``The King and I.'' A mix of old-fashioned moviemaking
doused with contemporary political correctness, it arrives at
exactly the right time of year. (SM) 2 hours, 20 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere but Here'' PG-13 (sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon
</P>
<P>
   and Natalie Portman.
</P>
<P>
   A monster of an Oscar-nomination machine. Both Susan Sarandon
and Natalie Portman deserve to be on the short list come Academy
Awards time for breathing fresh air into an all-too-familiar
mother/daughter act. Sarandon, the brassy, indomitable mom, brings
her teenage daughter (Portman) to Hollywood to become a star. The
plot is negligible, but the performances are the point. (ERG) 1
hour, 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bachelor'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chris O'Donnell
</P>
<P>
   and Renee Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   Chris O'Donnell plays Jimmy, a San Francisco playboy who loses
his girl, Anne (Renee Zellweger), then finds he'll inherit $100
million if he marries within 24 hours. A clumsy remake of Buster
Keaton's silent classic ``Seven Chances,'' it retains the
original's surreal image of thousands of potential brides chasing
the groom-to-be. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loopy original. John Cusack plays a quirky file clerk who
discovers a door that leads into the noggin of actor John
Malkovich. The movie toys with big concepts _ the nature of
identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire that blurs gender
lines, the illusion of free will _ without ever stopping long
enough to state a thesis. It's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And it's often hysterically funny. (SM) 1 hour, 52
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Man'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Taye Diggs, Nia Long
</P>
<P>
   and Morris Chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   Better than ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' In Malcolm D. Lee's
often funny, sexy and prickly new comedy-drama, Taye Diggs heads a
talented ensemble cast in a glossy wedding film punctuated with
soul-stirring music (Bob Marley, Stevie Wonder, Meshell
Ndegeocello, Maxwell), flurries of flesh and real dramatic bite.
The ensemble cast is all good. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Bicentennial Man'' PG (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams,
</P>
<P>
   Embeth Davidtz and Sam Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays the android Andrews, a metallic butler who
slowly develops human traits (creativity, curiosity and a hint of
emotion). But the people around him age, wither, die. Overlong,
like most flicks this time of year, ``Man'' moves swiftly for its
first 90 minutes, but it slows down to become a disappointingly
conventional love story that isn't really persuasive. The movie has
a heart, but a flagging pulse. (SM) 2 hours, 12 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bone Collector'' R (profanity, violence and grisly images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Double Jeopardy,'' this crime drama is, at its core, pure
pulp filmmaking. It delivers plenty of sucker punches. But thanks
to the film's two talented stars _ Denzel Washington as a brainy
quadriplegic detective and Angelina Jolie as his equally brainy
forensics cop _ this thriller's got enough electricity to make it
watchable. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (sexuality, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   John Irving has adapted his own novel. In the first half, Dr.
Larch (Michael Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal
abortions in his remote Maine orphanage. In the second,
less-engaging half, Larch's protege, parentless Homer Wells (Tobey
Maguire), runs off with a World War II pilot and his girlfriend to
learn about the world. Excellent performances by Caine and by
Delroy Lindo as an apple picker. (ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogma'' R (profanity, sex-related dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   violence, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck,
</P>
<P>
   Matt Damon and Linda Fiorentino.
</P>
<P>
   As if God can't take a joke, ``Dogma'' has already been
lambasted by a Catholic anti-defamation group and dumped by its
original studio Miramax (the indie Lions Gate picked it up). While
the film pulls no punches in roasting organized religion, it does
so with such minimal spunk and spare inventiveness you have to
wonder what all the fuss is about. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 5
minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Jeopardy'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ashley Judd
</P>
<P>
   and Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Judd plays a woman out to wreak justice on the husband
who framed her for murder, and Tommy Lee Jones is the parole
officer on her trail in this action flick with a gender twist. For
better and for worse, the movie is as professional, efficient and
aloof as Judd's performance. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``End of Days'' R (violence and gore, a strong sex scene,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger
</P>
<P>
   and Gabriel Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger than ever, the movies' biggest he-man Arnold
Schwarzenegger leaps into action, going mano a mano with a
beady-eyed Gabriel Byrne as the devil in this explosion-happy
thriller. Awash in often too-dark cinematography and bloated with
bombs, gore and gross-outs, ``Days'' is a movie full of punches but
no spark. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence,
</P>
<P>
   sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   A manipulative but meticulously crafted, absorbing, beautifully
acted and deeply satisfying adaptation of Stephen King's prison
novel. Tom Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose latest
prisoner, a mysterious hulk played by Michael Clarke Duncan, has
mystical powers of healing . ``Mile'' is exactly the sort of
package Oscar voters love. (SM) 3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   More smoke than fire in this reality-based film about what
happened when former tobacco consultant Jeffrey Wigand (Russell
Crowe) agreed to tell his story on ``60 Minutes'' at the behest of
producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino). Bergman gets the star
treatment (one senses a certain pandering to Pacino), but Wigand's
predicament is more riveting, with Crowe in an Oscar-worthy
performance. (ERG) 2 hours, 37 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Night'' R (sexuality, profanity and brief violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Oh, Don McKellar
</P>
<P>
   and Callum Keith Rennie.
</P>
<P>
   A lovely, offbeat look at the end of the world. Unlike
Hollywood's special-effects behemoths, Canadian
writer-director-actor Don McKellar treats the final apocalypse with
a dry wit and a sense of decorum that consciously tweaks that
nation's reputation for civility. A strong ensemble cast
(especially Sandra Oh) relate a variety of tales that are simple on
the surface, but cut deep. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Messenger:
</P>
<P>
   The Story of Joan of Arc'' R (graphic battles, a rape,
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Milla Jovovich
</P>
<P>
   When Joan (Milla Jovovich) rallies her troops to victory against
the British, the film has considerable visual oomph. But when the
swordplay slows and the characters talk, you realize the film
doesn't know what to make of its heroine. It hedges its bets,
presenting her as equal parts saint and teenage fanatic. The result
is, pardon the term, half-baked. (SM) 2 hours, 21 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysteries of Egypt'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Omar Sharif
</P>
<P>
   and Kate Maberly.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic's bigger-than-life Imax film offers many
breathtaking views of Egypt's natural and man-made wonders. There
is ample footage of giant pyramids, huge statues and redwood-tall
columns, all frequently displayed from ground view with a seemingly
you-are-there feel. Warning: Some of the narration is pure hokum.
(Bob Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Omega Code'' PG-13 (several scenes of shootings)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Casper Van Dien,
</P>
<P>
   Michael York, Catherine Oxenberg
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Ironside.
</P>
<P>
   Michael York and Casper Van Dien star in this overly talkative
tale reminiscent of the book of Revelation. As wealthy businessman
Stone Alexander, York steals and uses a secret biblical code to
effect a world takeover. The hammy Van Dien plays Gillen Lane, a
glam gadabout and motivational leader who uncovers York's plot and
must act to save the globe. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 39 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature
</P>
<P>
   directed by Kunihiko Yuyama.
</P>
<P>
   Hokey Poke. Based on the infinitely popular Japanese toy phenom,
the animated movie features Mewtwo, a Pokemon clone with psychic
powers who kapows his creators and starts cloning other Pokemons
into his personal arsenal for a world takeover. The movie has
intentionally stilted animation, uninspired music and lame jokes.
Includes the short cartoon ``Pikachu's Vacation.'' (Bob Longino) 1
hour, 29 minutes. F
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke'' PG-13 (violence and gore)
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices
</P>
<P>
   of Billy Crudup, Billy Bob Thornton,
</P>
<P>
   Claire Danes and Minnie Driver.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Disney kid stuff. There's so much going on in this
astonishing, mystically complex animated epic from Japan that it
makes Wagner's Ring Cycle look like the Teletubbies. It's a ``once
upon a time'' tale about the battle between nature and
civilization. Boldly innovative yet eerily innocent, it's the sort
of thing you simply have to see for yourself. (ERG) 2 hours, 15
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Ride With the Devil'' R (graphic war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tobey Maguire,
</P>
<P>
   Skeet Ulrich and Jewel.
</P>
<P>
   Worth the ride. Ang Lee's fervent, oddly gallant film about the
fringes of the Civil War. The movie is random, sprawling and
piecemeal, but it can be seen as a contemplation on the warring
factions of the American nature _ settling scores vs. settling
down. The film mostly takes place in Missouri and Kansas with
Quantrill's Raid on Lawrence, Kan., providing the blood-soaked
centerpiece and moral fulcrum. (ERG) 2 hours, 14 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Siegfried &AMP; Roy:
</P>
<P>
   The Magic Box'' Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Siegfried Fischbacher
</P>
<P>
   and Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Cirque du Surreal. Siegfried and Roy _ those
hocus-pocus, Las Vegas glam guys _ star in this dumbfoundingly
watchable 3-D Imax that's girded like some weird Wagnerian opera.
Elephants disappear. Furry white tigers leap over your head. Giant
metal dragons spew fire. Obviously, the concept of garish didn't
die with Liberace. (Bob Longino) 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM) 1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' R (violence and gore,
</P>
<P>
   a scene of sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Heads up: Tim Burton is back. His latest is a blend of scary
swordplay, witchcraft and self-spoofing humor served with tongue
planted firmly in cheek. Johnny Depp is effective as Ichabod Crane,
who's sent to investigate a series of beheadings in 1799 Sleepy
Hollow. The movie's comic relief balances the Headless Horseman's
single-minded attacks, which spare neither men, women or children.
(SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Farnsworth
</P>
<P>
   and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   David Lynch shifts gears in this lyrically simple little film
based on the true story of 70-plus Alvin Straight (Richard
Farnsworth), who drove his 1966 John Deere riding mower more than
300 miles to reconcile with his estranged brother (Harry Dean
Stanton). The movie is a sublime celebration of America at its most
beautiful: kind, welcoming, gloriously eccentric. (ERG) 1 hour, 41
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little'' PG (brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geena Davis,
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lipnicki
</P>
<P>
   and the voice of Michael J. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Based very loosely on E.B. White's 1945 children's book, Stuart
is a 3-inch-tall computer-animated wonder voiced by Michael J. Fox.
He brushes his teeth, gargles and aw-shucks smiles with such
convincing visuals you'll swear he's the next best critter since
``Babe.'' But his movie, at first charming and angelic, turns into
run-of-the-mill slapstick. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 33 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' G
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation
</P>
<P>
   featuring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and Joan Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   More rock 'em, sock 'em fun than families have seen in years.
Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and old and new
characters are locked in a delightful story of toy rustling and
what it means to love a child. With its inspired, hilarious script,
a heartfelt new song (``When She Loved Me'') and downright stunning
visuals, ``Toy Story 2'' isn't just better than ``Cats,'' it's
better than ``Toy Story.'' (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 25 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Train of Life'' R (brief nudity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lionel Abelanski
</P>
<P>
   and Rufus.
</P>
<P>
   Another Holocaust wish-fulfillment comedy. In 1941, some Eastern
European Jews decide to beat the Nazis at their own game. They
stage their own deportation, fooling the Nazis into thinking
they're headed for a concentration camp. The cast overacts and the
plot is worthy of a ``Hogan's Heroes'' episode, but the premise is
inventive and a coda makes up for much that went before. In French
with subtitles. (ERG) 1 hour, 43 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumbleweeds'' PG-13 (profanity, sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and a scene of domestic discord)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Janet McTeer
</P>
<P>
   and Kimberly J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely give this one a tumble. Janet McTeer and Kimberly J.
Brown are already generating Oscar buzz for their sensational
performances in this funny, heartfelt film. McTeer is a sassy
Southerner with a talent for finding the wrong men. Brown is her
savvy adolescent daughter who knows her mom's hit-and-run tactics
all too well. It sounds like ``Anywhere But Here,'' but it's a far
more real, more affecting work. (ERG) 1 hour, 40 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Is Not Enough'' PG-13 (violence, sexuality and
innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan,
</P>
<P>
   Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   This 19th James Bond movie is more of the same old same old.
Bond is assigned by M (Judi Dench) to protect an heiress (Sophie
Marceau) and her oil pipeline from a nut-case terrorist (Robert
Carlyle). There's the usual eye-popping opening stunt sequence.
It's as if everyone involved knew how to make a Bond movie, but
they were thinking about something else at the time. (ERG) 2 hours,
8 minutes. C-

 &HT;    ADAM'S MARK HOTELS NAMED IN FEDERAL RACE BIAS SUIT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department filed a federal
discrimination Thursday lawsuit against Adam's Mark Hotels and
Resorts, alleging that it violated the rights of black patrons in
its 21 hotels across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of behavior is simply unacceptable,'' Attorney
General Janet Reno said at a news conference. ``It is hard to
believe that 35 years after the Civil Rights Act was passed by
Congress, this type of discrimination still exists.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation of the hotel chain, which is owned by
HBE Corp. of St. Louis, found that minorities _ especially large
groups of blacks _ were given less desirable accommodations than
white guests, were charged more for rooms, in-room movies and hotel
bars, and had to adhere to stricter security requirements such as
wearing orange wrist bands for identification.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the actions were a clear violation of the Civil Rights
Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or
religion in public accommodations. The lawsuit against the hotel
chain would mandate changes in its alleged discriminatory
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint of inferior treatment of blacks was not isolated
to a few hotels within the chain, but was part of a corporate
policy to discourage minority patrons, said Bill Lann Lee, acting
assistant attorney general for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Kummer, president of HBE Corp., said ``we believe the facts
will prove that our conduct has reflected no bias with regard to
race or ethnicity, and that our actions were consistent with those
employed by other leading lodging companies across the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Minorities make up nearly 55 percent of HBE's employees
nationwide and about 21 percent of its supervisory and management
positions, according to Kummer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state of Florida announced it is joining in a
private lawsuit filed by disgruntled black patrons who stayed at
the Daytona Beach Adam's Mark Hotel during the ``Black College
Reunion'' in April.
</P>
<P>
   The patrons suing the Daytona Beach hotel allege that it removed
furnishings from the lobby and their rooms when they checked in,
denied them access to the main driveway in front of the hotel, and
refused to provide them with valet parking.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth, who joined Reno at the
news conference, said that in addition to the the state's
intervention in the private lawsuit, he was also filing a state
civil rights complaint against the hotel on behalf of nearly 1,200
black patrons who alleged discrimination in April.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Daytona Beach hotel, there are Adam's Mark
resorts in Orlando and Clearwater.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels across the country that were investigated included
locations in Grand Junction, Denver, and Colorado Springs, Colo.;
Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio, Texas; Winston-Salem and
Charlotte, N.C.; Columbia, S.C.; and Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's Mark hotels are also scheduled to open in Atlanta and
Jacksonville next year.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said that although a lawsuit has been filed, the
investigation will continue. The Justice Department urged
individuals who believe they were victims of discrimination or have
information on discrimination at any of the 21 Adam's Mark Hotels
to call the Housing and Civil Enforcement Section of the Civil
Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743.

 &HT;    Washington's `Titans' recalls racial strife on gridiron
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Denzel Washington, clad in black shorts, maroon golf
shirt and cleated shoes, is anything but the stylish leading man
strutting around the football practice field at Clarkston High
School in DeKalb County, Ga. And he's barking like somebody had
better step up to win one for the Gipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK. Let's go, let's go,'' the Oscar-winning actor shouts.
``Show me that option. Left again!''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two white-suited extras portraying football players, a
roughly equal number of whites and African-Americans, leap into a
fierce crash of shoulder pads. They do it again. And again. And
again.
</P>
<P>
   For just over two months, Washington's loud snarls and the
menacing crack of shoulder pads have been heard all across metro
Atlanta and North Georgia _ from Berry College in Rome and Druid
Hills High School in DeKalb County to the city of Covington and
Grady High School in Midtown Atlanta _ as a Disney movie crew has
been completing the big-screen football drama ``Remember the
Titans.''
</P>
<P>
   Budgeted at more than $10 million, the film, expected to be
rated PG and debut next fall, stars Washington and Will Patton
(``Armageddon'') as two real-life coaches _ one African-American
and one white _ who teamed in 1971 to lead a racially plagued high
school football team against great odds to an undefeated season and
the Virginia AAA state championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an emotional piece with very emotional characters,''
producer Jerry Bruckheimer (``Armageddon,'' ``The Rock,'' ``Top
Gun'') says while surveying filming at Clarkston High on a day when
``Titan's'' strict closed set policy was relaxed for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution and ``60 Minutes,'' which filmed a profile of
Washington expected to air next month. ``I love scenes where people
make a difference and these two coaches definitely made a
difference. They changed a community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Titan's'' real-life coaches are Herman Boone, a former North
Carolina coach, who rocked Alexandria, Va., by being named head
coach at T.C. Williams High in 1971 after three schools were
combined into one under forced desegregation, and Bill Yoast, a
former coach at Roswell High School here who had been expected to
be named T.C.'s leader. Both are serving as consultants on
``Titans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Herman had been in the city as an assistant but I didn't know
him,'' Yoast says. ``The people in my area _ I had a lot of
followers _ were really outraged when Herman was named head coach
over me. I had nine starters who said if you're not going to coach
at T.C. we're not going to play. You look back, we had a hard time
because you can imagine that here are all these kids battling at
the schools (over desegregation) and all of a sudden we're all on
the same team.''
</P>
<P>
   The script includes a few scenes of angry townspeople hurling
bricks into Boone's home, death threats and confrontations at a
restaurant that refuses to serve African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, the racial attacks were non-stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something happened to my house every ballgame,'' Boone says.
``Not just bricks. They left toilet bowls on my lawn, painted slurs
on my house and covered it in eggs. That strengthened me. I wasn't
going to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the turmoil, the two coaches supported each other with
Boone taking the offense and Yoast leading the defense. Their
coaching styles were also attractive opposites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herman is so aggressive _ a Woody Hayes type,'' Yoast says.
``I'm more like Tom Landry.'' Boone describes it this way: Yoast is
``the calm before the storm. I'm the storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, who repeatedly declined to be interviewed in Atlanta
for ``Titans,'' and Patton spent time with both coaches for
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denzel came to my house in Alexandria the night of a
hurricane,'' Boone recalls. ``He wanted especially to know things I
said, how I talked and like my family's word for cursing. We use
John Brown. If you're mad, you say 'John Brown it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really trying to play me,'' Boone says. ``It becomes
frightening. After all this, I may not be able to go to the
drugstore ever again.''
</P>

`FIRST SEVEN YEARS': PITY THE COBBLER WITH A SCUFFED SOUL
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
By WALTER GOODMAN  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernard Malamud's ``First Seven Years'' is a love story in which
the lovers are never caught meeting, neither on the page nor in
Sunday's quiet screen adaption. Emotions are subdued in Feld's shoe
repair shop on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, but passion for
Feld's pretty 19-year-old daughter, Miriam, bubbles in the bosom of
Sobel, 35, a concentration-camp survivor who has been Feld's sole
employee for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's feelings are confined to books; Sobel lends Miriam
``The Brothers Karamazov,'' not your typical love story. Feld
discerns that something is up and wants a more promising match for
his daughter than an over-the-hill cobbler. ``Don't you want to
meet a college boy?'' he pleads. He tries to fix her up with young
Max, who is studying to be an accountant when he is not reading the
sports pages.
</P>
<P>
   The taciturn Sobel puts down his tools, takes off his apron and
quits. In what must be the first real talk about the most important
thing in both men's lives, he protests to Feld: ``Why do you look
for boys on the street to go out with Miriam? Why don't you think
of me?''
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much the tale, distinctively Malamudian in its
sureness of characterization, if not one of his most imposing
works. These are little people with big hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Seven Years'' benefits Friday night from the
30-minute production's faithfulness to place and to period
(although the shop is too tidy) and to Israel Horovitz's nuanced
portrayal of Feld. Although he is no philistine, it takes Sobel's
outburst to awaken him to both Sobel's love for Miriam and her own
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Feld knows that his quick reaction _ ``My Miriam will never
marry a man as old and as ugly as you'' _ is cruel, and he is too
decent not to appreciate what he owes to a loyal worker and a camp
survivor to boot. But not to worry: Max the aspiring accountant is
not for a girl who goes for Dostoyevsky.
</P>
<P>
   The performances are all low-key; neither Sobel (Ned Eisenberg)
nor Miriam (Annette Arnold) is given to romantic effusions, and
dramatic impact is determinedly understated or avoided. That seems
right for 1949, when Feld and Sobel are still absorbing the
imponderables of the Holocaust while scrabbling to make a living
and a life.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a somewhat bland dish: say, gefilte fish with not
enough bite. But the flavor is sweet, and it goes down easily. &QL;

`IN LOVE WITH NIGHT': DECONSTRUCTING ANOTHER KENNEDY MYTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The enigmatic title of Ronald Steel's new book, ``In Love With
Night,'' comes from the Shakespeare lines that Robert F. Kennedy
quoted, in a tribute to his assassinated brother, at the 1964
Democratic National Convention. The lines, spoken by Juliet about
Romeo, read:
</P>
<P>
   When he shall die,
</P>
<P>
   Take him and cut him out in little stars,
</P>
<P>
   And he will make the face of heaven so fine
</P>
<P>
   That all the world will be in love with night,
</P>
<P>
   And pay no worship to the garish sun.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion with both Kennedy brothers, of course, is that
they have become posthumous members of a dazzling celestial
pantheon, mythic figures more powerful in death than in life.
</P>
<P>
   There is a second, darker meaning, however, to the book's title.
Throughout this volume Steel speaks of the two Bobbys: the ``bad
Bobby'' (the vicious campaign manager, the merciless congressional
investigator) and the ``good Bobby'' (the empathetic advocate of
civil rights, the impassioned champion of the poor and the
oppressed).
</P>
<P>
   The ``bad Bobby,'' Steel asserts, committed ``dark deeds'' that
made him, in the words of Robert Frost, well ``acquainted with the
night.'' He defended, even applauded, the Red-baiting of his former
boss, Sen. Joseph McCarthy. As his brother's attorney general, he
demonstrated what Steel calls ``a disturbing tendency to justify
whatever behavior he found useful'' in his pursuit of adversaries
like Jimmy Hoffa. And in his zeal to get Fidel Castro, Steel
writes, he ``was drawn excitedly into the shadowy world of
counterinsurgency,'' proposing what amounted to ``a U.S.-financed
and -directed terrorist operation.''
</P>
<P>
   In this volume Steel, the author of such critically acclaimed
books as ``Pax Americana'' and ``Walter Lippmann and the American
Century,'' tries to deconstruct the myths that have grown up around
Robert Kennedy, most notably the myths that ``had he lived and
become president, he would have quickly ended the Vietnam War,
brought black and white Americans together, alleviated poverty and
discrimination and achieved a more just and humane society.''
</P>
<P>
   Steel concludes that ``there is little, beyond hope and need, to
lead us to believe'' that Kennedy could _ or would _ have
accomplished such dreams. He reminds us that RFK ``is not
remembered for any single great achievement'' in his thousand days
as attorney general or his equally brief tenure as a U.S. senator,
and he adds that ``much of Kennedy's allure lies in the future
conditional: in what he would have been, what he would have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Such observations are not exactly earthshaking, especially in
light of all the revisionist portraits of the Kennedys in recent
years. In fact, ``In Love With Night,'' which Steel describes as
``a study of character and circumstance'' in the style of
Plutarch's ``Lives,'' is essentially a long essay that pulls
together a lot of familiar material while glossing it with
speculative analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The chapters about President John F. Kennedy's administration
are indebted to books by Michael R. Beschloss and Richard Reeves,
while Steel's examination of RFK's contentious relationship with
Lyndon B. Johnson owes a serious debt to Jeff Shesol's compelling
1997 book ``Mutual Contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of RFK's involvement in CIA plots against Castro
and his possible role in catalyzing events that would lead to his
brother's assassination, Steel goes further than Shesol. Whereas
Shesol suggested that Robert Kennedy might have experienced ``guilt
_ or fear that his own adventurism had cost his brother's life,''
Steel contends that ``his sense of guilt was overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Bobby who had hounded the Mafia; who had goaded the CIA
to get rid of Castro; who knew of his brother's connection to the
very Mafia don the CIA had hired to kill the Cuban leader,'' Steel
writes in one particularly melodramatic passage. ``The psychic
weight of such a burden of knowledge and responsibility must have
been enormous _ the fear that in his single-minded zeal to destroy
those whom he considered to be evil, he had set in motion actions
that resulted in the murder of his brother. This is the horrible
irony he carried with him and kept secret until the day he died. He
had trafficked in the darkest realms of conspiracy and murder, and
he had brought this fate upon himself. It was the classic
definition of Greek tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is popularly believed that the grief Robert Kennedy
experienced over his brother's death ``helped humanize him,'' that
in the months after the assassination a sensitive, caring ``new
Bobby'' emerged ``from the chrysalis of the old.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Steel seems to believe that RFK tried, near the end of
his life, ``to compensate for his failings by identifying himself
with the deprived,'' he remains skeptical about the depth of this
transformation. He credits Robert Kennedy with having ``learned to
talk the talk,'' giving speeches that underscored his empathy with
the disfranchised, but argues that his new concern for civil rights
``could have been simple political calculation: he needed the votes
of black Americans if he was to stand a chance of being elected
senator or president.''
</P>
<P>
   Steel argues that RFK's antipoverty plan was insignificant as
``a national program to attack the causes of poverty, or as a means
of breaking down segregation.'' As for his stand on Vietnam, Steel
not only points out that Robert Kennedy had been an ardent hawk
(``we will remain here until we do win,'' he said in Saigon in
February 1962) but also adds that his eventual criticism of the war
was considerably less radical than Eugene McCarthy's.
</P>
<P>
   Had he lived and been elected president, Steel speculates,
Robert Kennedy ``would probably have worked out some means of
extrication from Vietnam earlier than Nixon did,'' but ``his
opposition to unilateral withdrawal and his vague formulas for a
negotiated settlement hardly differed from Nixon's `peace with
honor' formula.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, then, the portrait of RFK that Steel draws in this
slender book is that of a man in thrall to his brother's memory, a
man both imprisoned and empowered by his family's mythology, a man
who is ``remembered to this day as an idealist,'' but who was in
fact ``an agile and unsentimental realist in the pursuit and the
wielding of political power.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While computer experts question whether many Latin
American countries will be prepared to fend off millennium computer
bugs on Jan. 1, Mexico stands as a model of ``Y2K'' readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is an interesting success story,'' said John Koskinen,
head of the U.S. President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``Mexico is very well prepared'' for facing the
so-called Y2K bug, a widespread software flaw that could cause some
older computers to read only the last two digits of the date. That
seemingly small programming error could cause many computers to
malfunction or shut down on or after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen and other Y2K experts say that in terms of crushing
computer bugs, Mexico appears on par with its North American free
trade partners, the United States and Canada. Mexican industries
already have completed complex Y2K tests and demonstrated back-up
systems before international observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't guarantee nothing will happen, but we can say that
Mexico is prepared,'' said Victor Guerrero, technical director for
Mexico's Commission for Information Conversion in 2000 in Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts attribute Mexico's vigorous attack on the bug
to several factors, starting with President Ernesto Zedillo's
commitment to modernizing the nation's software. Rather than
procrastinate, as did many political and business leaders in other
Latin American countries, Zedillo assigned thousands of government
computer programmers, engineers and auditors to fix Y2K problems,
starting more than two years ago and committing $236 million to the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zedillo made Y2K a high priority issue,'' also meeting several
times with his counterparts from the United States and Canada to
coordinate bug-battling efforts, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico also had some advantages over the U.S. and Canada. In
Mexico, state monopolies control huge industries, which makes it
easier for the government to order nationwide repairs. For example,
Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission generates about 98 percent
of the country's power. In the United States, thousands of private
power companies had to manage the Y2K problem without direct
government oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico also has a state oil monopoly in Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex).
</P>
<P>
   Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) is privately owned, but it is a
monopoly that also went through the motions to correct potential
problems.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans have to count on the Y2K-readiness of thousands
of lending institutions, Mexicans have only 16 banks. This October,
those banks collectively performed a large-scale test to see how
check cashing, deposits and ATM withdrawals would be affected by
the date change. ``We discovered only small flaws,'' Guerrero said.
</P>
<P>
   By having far fewer companies to manage and far greater
government control over them, Zedillo was able to push
Y2K-remediation plans at a surprisingly quick pace, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mexico benefitted from its close business ties with
U.S. and European companies. For example, global automakers'
assembly plants in Mexico used the same software fixes there that
they used in domestic plants.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico only has about 5 million computers, most of which are
concentrated in the financial sector, government, airline services
and in large manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
   In July, six of Mexico's main airlines participated in a test
that required them to fly to various cities and land during and
after simulated clock changes.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, Mexican airports are planning to suspend
take-offs between 11:45 p.m. (CST) on Dec. 31 and 12:30 a.m. (CST)

 &HT;    Writer-director DePoy sets his latest mystery in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many beginning mystery writers read Raymond Chandler or Dashiell
Hammett for inspiration. Phillip DePoy turned to Argentine author
Jorge Luis Borges for the magical realism in his Flap Tucker
mystery novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stories are like little metaphysical mysteries,'' says
DePoy, whose latest novel, ``Dancing Made Easy'' (Dell, $5.99),
features his detective on the trail of a serial killer in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker is not like other private eyes. A Zen master with psychic
gifts, he uses patterns and meditation instead of a gun to solve
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The new novel opens with the discovery of a young woman hanging
by an apron string from a lamppost in Piedmont Park. Pinned to her
clothing is a note: ``Number One: The Tarantella.'' When a second
body is found with a second note that reads ``Number Two: The
Tango,'' Flap Tucker turns to the city's rival crime czars to help
stop the killer.
</P>
<P>
   DePoy, who juggles his writing career with a job as a theater
director, says he finds both stimulating. ``One informs the other.
One thing that helped sell the novel, my editor said, was the
dialogue that I get from theater.''
</P>
<P>
   DePoy's next directing project is ``The Complete History of
America, Abridged,'' which will be performed at Marietta's Theatre
in the Square in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his previous novel, ``Two Easy,'' has been nominated
for a Shamus Award. ``If you compare the Edgar Award to the
Oscar,'' he says with a laugh, ``then I guess the Shamus is the
equivalent to the Golden Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   DePoy will be onstage at 8 p.m. Sunday at the Horizon Theatre,
1083 Austin Ave. N.E., with three other performers for an ensemble
reading of ``Dancing Made Easy.'' Information: 404-584-7450.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Poetry of the people: Several years ago, poet laureate Robert
Pinsky set out to ask the American people what their favorite poems
were. After holding a series of open readings and sifting through
thousands of letters, Pinsky has compiled 200 of these in a new
anthology, ``America's Favorite Poems'' (Norton, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Included are five metro Atlantans' favorite poems with their
remarks. Nancy Nersessian, 51, relates the influence ``The
Sentence'' by Russian poet Anna Akhmatova had on her in
understanding her brother's experience in Vietnam. ``It struck me
very forcefully as capturing the struggle that my brother faced
with all the other traumatized vets.... He shipped out for Vietnam
in January 1970 and after a year in continuous combat he returned
home a decorated war hero and a broken man of 21.'' Part of the
poem reads: ``Today I have so much to do/ I must kill memory once
and for all, / I must turn my soul to stone, / I must learn to live
again ....''
</P>
<P>
   Yina Liang, 15, an Atlanta student, chose Emily Dickinson's
``I'm Nobody! Who Are You?'' because ``it tells me I can be by
myself, and it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Hartley, 36, an Atlanta furniture builder, said the first
verse of ``The Waking'' by Theodore Roethke _ ``I wake to sleep,
and take my waking slow'' _ helped him deal with his leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta student Lee Samuel, 11, chose Ernest Lawrence Thayer's
``Casey at the Bat'' because ``I am a complete baseball fanatic.''
Elizabeth Kendall, 13, a Conyers student, selected Sir Henry
Wotton's ``On a Bank as I Sat Fishing'' because of her love of the
outdoors. Nature seems so peaceful on the surface, she writes,
``but by lifting a rock, I can find a whole new world, full of
lizards and bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A career like a rocket: Huntsville, Ala., writer Homer H.
Hickam Jr., author of ``Rocket Boys,'' has signed a $1 million-plus
deal for two more books about his West Virginia childhood. The
inspiring autobiographical ``Rocket Boys,'' which was made into the
film ``October Sky,'' was the story of small-town boys who built a
rocket and won a national science competition. The first book in
the new contract is ``A Coalwood Christmas,'' a tale of the Hickham
family's last Christmas together in their mining town. The second
will continue the story of the boys to the summer after high school
graduation. Meanwhile, the movie rights to Hickham's novel, ``Back
to the Moon,'' have been sold to Beacon Pictures.

 &HT;    HOMELESSNESS, HUNGER PERSIST AMIDST PLENTY, MAYORS REPORT
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Problems of homelessness and hunger are growing
despite the nation's economic prosperity, according to a study
released Thursday by the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   ``From sea to shining sea, great pockets of homelessness exist
and persist,'' said Mayor Vincent Cianci of Providence, R.I., a
member of the task force.
</P>
<P>
   The 15th annual survey of 26 cities indicated that demands for
emergency food and shelter assistance are at their highest levels
in years. The numbers show no sign of leveling off, said Mayor
Peter Clavelle of Burlington, Vt., chair of the survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that this task force still exists is a statement in
itself,'' Clavelle said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Low-paying jobs and high housing costs are to blame for much of
the problems. The task force found the ``working poor'' had the
greatest need for emergency assistance programs, which in some
cases have had to turn away people seeking help because of excess
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homelessness is a symptom of larger problems,'' said Fred
Karnas, a deputy assistant secretary for economic development in
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment, mental illness and substance abuse contribute to
the homeless problem as well, Clavelle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what to do to fix these problems. We just need to do
more of it,'' Karnas said.
</P>
<P>
   The task force called for increased local control over services
and resources and more efforts by community-based organizations to
address low job skills and job placement.
</P>
<P>
   Education about benefit programs can also be expanded. Some
people may not be aware of their eligibility for federal
assistance, said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. One-third of
people eligible for food stamps don't take advantage of them, he
said.

 &HT;    For Use Sat., Dec. 18 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX and SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While computer experts question whether many Latin
American countries will be prepared to fend off millennium computer
bugs on Jan. 1, Mexico stands as a model of ``Y2K'' readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is an interesting success story,'' said John Koskinen,
head of the U.S. President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``Mexico is very well prepared'' for facing the
so-called Y2K bug, a widespread software flaw that could cause some
older computers to read only the last two digits of the date. That
seemingly small programming error could cause many computers to
malfunction or shut down on or after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen and other Y2K experts say that in terms of crushing
computer bugs, Mexico appears on par with its North American free
trade partners, the United States and Canada. Mexican industries
already have completed complex Y2K tests and demonstrated back-up
systems before international observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't guarantee nothing will happen, but we can say that
Mexico is prepared,'' said Victor Guerrero, technical director for
Mexico's Commission for Information Conversion in 2000 in Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts attribute Mexico's vigorous attack on the bug
to several factors, starting with President Ernesto Zedillo's
commitment to modernizing the nation's software. Rather than
procrastinate, as did many political and business leaders in other
Latin American countries, Zedillo assigned thousands of government
computer programmers, engineers and auditors to fix Y2K problems,
starting more than two years ago and committing $236 million to the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zedillo made Y2K a high priority issue,'' also meeting several
times with his counterparts from the United States and Canada to
coordinate bug-battling efforts, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico also had some advantages over the U.S. and Canada. In
Mexico, state monopolies control huge industries, which makes it
easier for the government to order nationwide repairs. For example,
Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission generates about 98 percent
of the country's power. In the United States, thousands of private
power companies had to manage the Y2K problem without direct
government oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico also has a state oil monopoly in Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex).
</P>
<P>
   Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) is privately owned, but it is a
monopoly that also went through the motions to correct potential
problems.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans have to count on the Y2K-readiness of thousands
of lending institutions, Mexicans have only 16 banks. This October,
those banks collectively performed a large-scale test to see how
check cashing, deposits and ATM withdrawals would be affected by
the date change. ``We discovered only small flaws,'' Guerrero said.
</P>
<P>
   By having far fewer companies to manage and far greater
government control over them, Zedillo was able to push
Y2K-remediation plans at a surprisingly quick pace, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mexico benefitted from its close business ties with
U.S. and European companies. For example, global automakers'
assembly plants in Mexico used the same software fixes there that
they used in domestic plants.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico only has about 5 million computers, most of which are
concentrated in the financial sector, government, airline services
and in large manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
   In July, six of Mexico's main airlines participated in a test
that required them to fly to various cities and land during and
after simulated clock changes.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, Mexican airports are planning to suspend
take-offs between 11:45 p.m. (CST) on Dec. 31 and 12:30 a.m. (CST)
on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But international observers, Guerrero said, have agreed that
Mexico's airports appear to be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been intense international activity here,'' he
added. Mexico belongs to a United Nations group that was directing
Y2K preparations. Mexico has also served as a coordinator helping
Central American and Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's national electrical supply will be supervised on the
night of Dec. 31 through Jan. 4 with an extra 1,500 technicians,
according to Jorge Hernandez Aguilar, manager of Information and
Telecommunications for the Federal Electrical Commission.
</P>

 &HT;    SYRIA-ISRAELI PEACE WOULD SETTLE MOST REGIONAL CONFLICT, BUT
PALESTINIANS IN WINGS
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-TALKS-1217.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Just before then-Egyptian President Anwar Sadat made
his historic journey of peace to Jerusalem in 1979, he asked Syrian
President Hafez Assad to join him.
</P>
<P>
   Assad refused. Moreover, when Sadat made his journey, an
embittered Assad declared a Syrian national day of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, Syria has lead the block of ``rejectionist'' Arab
countries, saying no to peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   That's why an agreement to continue peace talks in Washington in
January matters. Peace between Israel and Syria could lead to the
end of the Israeli-Arab conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a conviction that Syria is really in control of the
whole process of peacemaking,'' said Jordanian political analyst
Radwan Abdullah. ``If Syria joins the peace process, that's it. All
doors will be open.''
</P>
<P>
   A peace with Syria would likely bring along its neighbors _ from
Lebanon to Saudi Arabia. The largest question would be its affect
on peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   A success with Syria could relieve pressure on Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, who promised voters he would make peace, to
deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Barak's trip to Washington has extended delays in two
peace process deadlines _ the next transfer of land to the
Palestinians and the next release of Palestinians from Israeli
jails.
</P>
<P>
   One Israeli newspaper reported Thursday that U.S. President Bill
Clinton urged Barak not to play the Syrians off against the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Palestinian officials say there can't be a
peaceful Middle East if they are left forgotten and stateless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the core of the problem,'' Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat told Cox Newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Though Syria could attack with tanks over a border, it has not
for nearly 20 years. The Israelis and Palestinians, meanwhile,
clash frequently in close quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the daily strategic threat to them and they are the
daily life strategic threat to us,'' Erekat said. ``We cannot
escape each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials say security in Syria will make it easier to
make deals all around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The developments with Syria aren't going to have any negative
impact on talks with Palestinians. Rather, it's the other way
around,'' Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said last week.
</P>
<P>
   American University in Cairo political scientist Walid Kazziha
said, however, that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's influence
over Israel is already slipping and will drop more if Syria leads
the other Arab states into peace.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, meanwhile, could fulfill Israel's dream of being accepted
throughout the Middle East. Egypt signed a treaty with Israel in
1982. The PLO officially ended its hostilities in 1993 and Jordan
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis, and American mediators, see Syria as the key to the
rest of the ``rejectionists'' in the region.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Syria controls Lebanon, maintaining 40,000 troops
there. In any agreement, Israel will insist that Syria reign in the
Hezbollah guerillas fighting against Israel in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   That would end the 18-year war Israel has fought there and lead
to its withdrawal from Lebanese land its has occupied for 18 years.
Lebanon would then likely sign a treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Syria could also bring Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Persian
Gulf Arab states to open relations with Israel. Some of them
explored diplomatic ties with Israel during the intense 1994-96
round of Syria-Israel talks.
</P>
<P>
   The oil-rich Gulf states and technology-savvy Israel are eager
to begin trade with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Syria is the Arab country with the best relations with
Iran, and could act as an intermediary between the two enemies.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While computer experts question whether many Latin
American countries will be prepared to fend off millennium computer
bugs on Jan. 1, Mexico stands as a model of ``Y2K'' readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is an interesting success story,'' said John Koskinen,
head of the U.S. President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``Mexico is very well prepared'' for facing the
so-called Y2K bug, a widespread software flaw that could cause some
older computers to read only the last two digits of the date. That
seemingly small programming error could cause many computers to
malfunction or shut down on or after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen and other Y2K experts say that in terms of crushing
computer bugs, Mexico appears on par with its North American free
trade partners, the United States and Canada. Mexican industries
already have completed complex Y2K tests and demonstrated back-up
systems before international observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't guarantee nothing will happen, but we can say that
Mexico is prepared,'' said Victor Guerrero, technical director for
Mexico's Commission for Information Conversion in 2000 in Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts attribute Mexico's vigorous attack on the bug
to several factors, starting with President Ernesto Zedillo's
commitment to modernizing the nation's software. Rather than
procrastinate, as did many political and business leaders in other
Latin American countries, Zedillo assigned thousands of government
computer programmers, engineers and auditors to fix Y2K problems,
starting more than two years ago and committing $236 million to the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zedillo made Y2K a high priority issue,'' also meeting several
times with his counterparts from the United States and Canada to
coordinate bug-battling efforts, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico also had some advantages over the U.S. and Canada. In
Mexico, state monopolies control huge industries, which makes it
easier for the government to order nationwide repairs. For example,
Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission generates about 98 percent
of the country's power. In the United States, thousands of private
power companies had to manage the Y2K problem without direct
government oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico also has a state oil monopoly in Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex).
</P>
<P>
   Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) is privately owned, but it is a
monopoly that also went through the motions to correct potential
problems.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans have to count on the Y2K-readiness of thousands
of lending institutions, Mexicans have only 16 banks. This October,
those banks collectively performed a large-scale test to see how
check cashing, deposits and ATM withdrawals would be affected by
the date change. ``We discovered only small flaws,'' Guerrero said.
</P>
<P>
   By having far fewer companies to manage and far greater
government control over them, Zedillo was able to push
Y2K-remediation plans at a surprisingly quick pace, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mexico benefitted from its close business ties with
U.S. and European companies. For example, global automakers'
assembly plants in Mexico used the same software fixes there that
they used in domestic plants.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico only has about 5 million computers, most of which are
concentrated in the financial sector, government, airline services
and in large manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
   In July, six of Mexico's main airlines participated in a test
that required them to fly to various cities and land during and
after simulated clock changes.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, Mexican airports are planning to suspend
take-offs between 11:45 p.m. (CST) on Dec. 31 and 12:30 a.m. (CST)
on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But international observers, Guerrero said, have agreed that
Mexico's airports appear to be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been intense international activity here,'' he
added. Mexico belongs to a United Nations group that was directing
Y2K preparations. Mexico has also served as a coordinator helping
Central American and Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's national electrical supply will be supervised on the
night of Dec. 31 through Jan. 4 with an extra 1,500 technicians,
according to Jorge Hernandez Aguilar, manager of Information and
Telecommunications for the Federal Electrical Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something happens, we'll be the first thing society
notices,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the electrical commission invested $45 million in
overhauling its equipment. If computers fail, however, the system
can be run manually, Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready just as we would be ready for a natural
disaster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The electricity commission also has an early-warning system that
will alert technicians if other countries begin to experience
problems as the clock changes. It also has an independent satellite
telephone system for communications.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's only nuclear power plant, Laguna Verde on the Gulf
Coast, has also been prepared for the new millennium. Accusations
of mismanagement and corruption have dogged the plant in the past,
but Hernandez said Laguna Verde's Y2K readiness meets international
standards, including those set by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said more than 130 private businesses were concerned
enough to petition the electricity commission to check its system
to ensure preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's huge Volkswagen car manufacturer, for example, asked to
audit the commission.
</P>
<P>
   We opened our doors because it was beneficial for us to know if
there was a problem,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Where Mexico may have problems is with its small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in the United States, many small entrepreneurs have not
had the time or money to focus on Y2K the way big businesses have.
But some computer experts say Mexico's small businesses may
actually have an advantage in terms of Y2K because they still
operate with manual systems that do not depend on computers.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Just before then-Egyptian President Anwar Sadat made
his historic journey of peace to Jerusalem in 1979, he asked Syrian
President Hafez Assad to join him.
</P>
<P>
   Assad refused. Moreover, when Sadat made his journey, an
embittered Assad declared a Syrian national day of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, Syria has lead the block of ``rejectionist'' Arab
countries, saying no to peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   That's why an agreement to continue peace talks in Washington in
January matters. Peace between Israel and Syria could lead to the
end of the Israeli-Arab conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a conviction that Syria is really in control of the
whole process of peacemaking,'' said Jordanian political analyst
Radwan Abdullah. ``If Syria joins the peace process, that's it. All
doors will be open.''
</P>
<P>
   A peace with Syria would likely bring along its neighbors _ from
Lebanon to Saudi Arabia. The largest question would be its affect
on peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   A success with Syria could relieve pressure on Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, who promised voters he would make peace, to
deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Barak's trip to Washington has extended delays in two
peace process deadlines _ the next transfer of land to the
Palestinians and the next release of Palestinians from Israeli
jails.
</P>
<P>
   One Israeli newspaper reported Thursday that U.S. President Bill
Clinton urged Barak not to play the Syrians off against the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Palestinian officials say there can't be a
peaceful Middle East if they are left forgotten and stateless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the core of the problem,'' Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat told Cox Newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Though Syria could attack with tanks over a border, it has not
for nearly 20 years. The Israelis and Palestinians, meanwhile,
clash frequently in close quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the daily strategic threat to them and they are the
daily life strategic threat to us,'' Erekat said. ``We cannot
escape each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials say security in Syria will make it easier to
make deals all around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The developments with Syria aren't going to have any negative
impact on talks with Palestinians. Rather, it's the other way
around,'' Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said last week.
</P>
<P>
   American University in Cairo political scientist Walid Kazziha
said, however, that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's influence
over Israel is already slipping and will drop more if Syria leads
the other Arab states into peace.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, meanwhile, could fulfill Israel's dream of being accepted
throughout the Middle East. Egypt signed a treaty with Israel in
1982. The PLO officially ended its hostilities in 1993 and Jordan
in 1994.
</P>

THE MARK OF MCCAIN: DEBATING PRESIDENTIAL CHARACTER AND SANITY

<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GREENBERG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's five years as a prisoner of war positioned him to
run for president as the candidate of ``character.'' His Vietnam
ordeal, it was said, made him candid, brave, inner-directed.
</P>
<P>
   Now McCain is running from the character issue: His Vietnam
ordeal, detractors allege, left him irascible, unstable, unfit for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   McCain recently released 1,500 pages of medical records to
provide what The New York Times has called ``the broadest look ever
given the public at the psychological profile of a presidential
candidate.'' Presidential ``character'' has returned as a public
and media obsession.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the character of presidents has always mattered.
Whether charging that Thomas Jefferson took a slave as his mistress
or that Grover Cleveland fathered an illegitimate child, opponents
have long assailed the morals of presidential aspirants. But in the
19th century such mudslinging never amounted to a full-scale
attempt to assess a candidate's psychological profile.
</P>
<P>
   John Adams, John Quincy Adams and Abraham Lincoln all probably
suffered from ``melancholy''--or depression--but their mental
health didn't enter the public debate. Most people didn't even know
about their conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Only with the rise of Freudian theory--specifically, the idea
that not only the ``ill'' but also well-functioning people are
captive to unconscious motives--did anyone think to psychoanalyze a
president.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stanley Allen Renshon (author of the invaluable
book ``The Psychological Assessment of Presidential Candidates''),
the first such effort appeared in a 1912 New York Times Magazine
article titled ``Roosevelt as Analyzed by the New Psychology.'' The
article tried to explain inconsistent comments that former
president Theodore Roosevelt had made about supporting his
successor, William Taft, by postulating that TR harbored an
unresolved, repressed wish to run for president again himself.
Though hardly controversial by today's standards (not least because
we know that TR did choose to run in 1912), the story provoked an
outcry, including a denunciation from Freud himself.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the spread of psychoanalysis made putting candidates on
the couch acceptable, the advent of nuclear weapons made
``stability'' the watchword not only in geopolitics but also in
psychopolitics. In the 1956 presidential race, Democrats seized on
what columnist Max Lerner called ``The Triple Issue'': President
Eisenhower's frail physical health (he'd had a heart attack in
September 1955), nukes (the Soviet Union built a hydrogen bomb in
November 1955), and, in Lerner's phrase, ``the character of Richard
Nixon'' (liberals viewed Nixon, then vice president, as bellicose
and ruthless).
</P>
<P>
   In an election-eve speech, Adlai Stevenson, the Democrats'
standard-bearer, said that ``As a citizen more than a candidate ...
I recoil at the prospect of Mr. Nixon as custodian of this nation's
future, as guardian of the hydrogen bomb ... as Commander-in-Chief
of the United States armed forces.'' Close aides disapproved,
feeling Stevenson had gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Democrats reprised the issue in 1964. To Barry Goldwater's
slogan ``In your heart you know he's right,'' Democrats countered:
``In your guts you know he's nuts.'' Lyndon Johnson's camp
portrayed the Republican senator as a trigger-happy Strangelove
likely to blow up the world.
</P>
<P>
   The now-defunct magazine FACT, published by the eccentric Ralph
Ginzburg, polled 12,356 members of the American Psychiatric
Association and used the 2,419 responses to conclude that the
psychiatrists considered Goldwater paranoid. While plenty of
psychiatrists did question Goldwater's temperament and judgment,
the study's methodology was so egregiously flawed that Goldwater
won a libel suit against the magazine. The APA itself denounced the
article--though, significantly, it also allowed that more
``reliable'' psychological assessments of a candidate might
reasonably inform voters' decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was the victors of those races, Johnson and
Nixon, who would further elevate the question of psychological
fitness for the presidency. With Nixon, the issue surfaced when
muckraker Drew Pearson told a National Press Club audience, just
after the 1968 election, that as vice president, Nixon had
consulted Arnold Hutschnecker, a New York physician specializing in
psychosomatic illnesses. To his death, Nixon maintained he had
consulted Hutschnecker only as a physician and not for
psychotherapy, though skeptics wondered why he would travel to New
York for a checkup. One unproven claim was impotence.
</P>
<P>
   When in 1973 Gerald Ford appeared before a Senate panel to be
confirmed as vice president, he had to explain his own visits to
Hutschnecker. ``One Question Marks Ford Hearing,'' read the New
York Times headline over the story about Ford's testimony. Ford's
explanation: He had visited the doctor on Nixon's urging, but only
socially.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutschnecker episode introduced a new aspect of the
character issue: the stigma of seeing a shrink. In the New York
Times, Hutschnecker argued that seeking help to secure one's
``emotional stability'' denoted ``not weakness but courage'' and
should not be stigmatized. Most commentators agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Hovering behind this debate, of course, was the lingering memory
of the 1972 campaign, when Missouri Sen. Thomas Eagleton, days
after being chosen as George McGovern's running mate, resigned from
the Democratic ticket after revealing that he had undergone
hospitalization and electroshock therapy for depression. That story
quickly (and somewhat inaccurately) came to be portrayed as an
illustration of the public's ignorance of mental health issues.
</P>
<P>
   By 1976, the character question was morphing from the matter of
mental stability into the larger issue of what kind of a president
a candidate would make. Watching Johnson and Nixon visit their
private demons on the nation made the public correctly curious
about candidates' hidden selves. Academicians, most notably
political scientist James David Barber in his influential
``Presidential Character,'' explored how to predict a president's
performance based on a systematic study of his character.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the decline of the major political parties was
creating a new ``candidate-centered'' politics, which emphasized
the individual and further spotlighted his psychic makeup.
</P>
<P>
   In these years, however, what people meant by ``character''
became increasingly confused. In 1976, Jimmy Carter stressed his
character, by which he meant his (alleged) honesty. In 1988, the
press expanded the issue to include questions of marital
infidelity, judgment, and narcissism, as Gary Hart learned the hard
way. By the Clinton years, the character question was reduced to a
checklist of intrusive inquiries about past infidelity, military
service and drug use--and, if evasive or dishonest answers were
given, also about honesty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   What we mean--and should mean--by ``character'' needs to be
disentangled. First, there's no question that seeking psychological
help needs to be destigmatized. Al and Tipper Gore have helped by
saying they've each had ``counseling'' but, as Frank Rich has
noted, Tipper's use of such euphemisms and the avoidance a
``professional title (that might include the prefix 'psych-') ...
sent the signal, consciously or not, that she wasn't entirely free
of shame herself.''
</P>
<P>
   When, after the Lewinsky affair, President Clinton chose not to
see a real clinician but a bunch of ministers, he sent the same
message.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, removing the stigma of therapy doesn't mean rejecting
consideration of character. Obviously, a president's ambition,
judgment, temperament, integrity, and ways of relating with other
people (among other psychological qualities) bear greatly on how he
will govern--at least as greatly as whatever election-year stands
he stakes out on ``the issues'' of policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson and Nixon presidencies are only the most salient
examples of this truth. Many others exist, too. One historian has
argued cogently that Calvin Coolidge's psychological problems
helped derail his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The real question, then, is how to assess character. Clearly,
the press has done a lousy job with its focus on behavior such as
infidelity or drug use that most people don't care about.
Alternatively, some psychotherapists have argued that professionals
alone should do the evaluating.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, Arnold Hutschnecker, reveling in his 15 minutes of
fame, proposed establishing an official board of psychiatrists to
screen all presidential candidates. Not surprisingly, the push for
a shrinkocracy has gained little support.
</P>
<P>
   Yet just because we've failed to think clearly about what
character involves doesn't mean we should cease to think about it.
The press can also do a poor job analyzing policy issues--what was
the last really illuminating story you read about the Social
Security trust fund?--but no one argues it should abandon the
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The press is right to focus on character. Now it needs to think
more rigorously about how to do so.

</P>
<P>
   Upstairs from Samson's Vitamins and Herbs, at the corner of 17th
and Church streets in northwest Washington, D.C., there's a funky
little eatery called the CyberSTOP Cafe. For $5 a half-hour you can
rent time on a PC or an iMac, while you sip an espresso and take in
the zany decor (chairs upholstered in leopard skin; a painting of
the Mona Lisa holding a coffee cup).
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore recently dropped by with some campaign staff and a few
reporters in tow, trudged up a narrow staircase, and had a campaign
aide shoot a video with a rented digital camera while he read a
letter to Bill Bradley. Then Gore downloaded the video onto one of
the CyberSTOP computers and e-mailed it to the Bradley campaign. He
put down a $20 tip and left.
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, a gimmick. But all technological
breakthroughs begin as gimmicks. Does video campaign spam have a
future?
</P>
<P>
   Before answering that question, let's examine the somewhat
flimsy substance of Gore's message to Bradley. (This won't take
long.) In the video e-mail, Gore asked Bradley, with great
sobriety, about an ``oversight'' in Bradley's campaign literature
concerning the Medicare trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my part,'' the flickering image of Gore intoned, ``I have
proposed dedicating a significant portion of the budget surplus to
Medicare to extend the life of the trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bradley's campaign literature doesn't propose
similarly fencing off funds for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since independent experts agree that more resources will be
necessary to assure Medicare is strong for the future,'' Gore
continued, ``my question is, 'What specific measures do you propose
to compensate for not dedicating any of the surplus to strengthen
the Medicare trust fund?'''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Gore said that Bradley's plan to expand health
coverage to uninsured Americans (which is more ambitious than
Gore's plan) would bankrupt the Medicare trust fund unless Bradley
raised taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The relevance of this attack is severely compromised by the
reality that 1) Bradley had already admitted he might have to raise
taxes if circumstances warranted it; and 2) during his cybercafe
appearance, Gore himself told reporters that ``you have to have
flexibility on the fiscal side.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Gore's query, Eric Hauser, a spokesman for
Bradley, pointed out that Gore was no more willing than Bradley to
rule out a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   So much for substance. Turning to technological matters, Hauser
admitted that Bradley never got around to viewing Gore's e-mail.
Neither did Hauser and neither did anyone Hauser knew of in the
campaign, though they were familiar with its content from reading a
transcript.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the video message got lost somewhere in the maw of
Bradley's campaign Web site. But obviously the video wasn't really
intended for Bradley; its target was the national press, a couple
hundred of whose members received e-mail press releases with the
video attached. Thanks to its novelty, the stunt won Gore some
coverage from The New York Times, Salon, Scripps Howard and a few
other outlets.
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't have to be a visionary to imagine where this might
go. The largest single expense that political campaigns face
nowadays is TV advertising. Gore, for instance, has dropped a
couple hundred thousand dollars on ads in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Video e-mailing is much cheaper. No, wait: Make that much, much,
much cheaper. Even figuring in Gore's $20 tip, the tab Gore ran up
sending his e-mail to Bradley and a bunch of reporters probably
came in at well under $100.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been even cheaper had Gore been able to use the
video camera already in his personal possession, but campaign
finance rules made that too difficult. Sending that same e-mail to
10 times as many people would have cost precisely the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Gore campaign has no grand plans to start spamming
unsuspecting citizens with video messages. It does plan, however,
to start sending video e-mails to people who have already indicated
on the campaign Web site that they'd like to receive such material.
They number in the tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too great a leap to envision that in future
presidential races--perhaps even in this one--candidates will take
the next step and start buying lists of e-mail addresses so they
can send targeted video messages or advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   If ``push'' technology makes a comeback, such video ads could be
force-fed to the public at large at a cost that, compared to
current media buys, would probably be microscopic. These ads
probably wouldn't be as effective as conventional TV ads--remember,
most homes in the United States still aren't wired to the Internet.
But they'd be so much more cost-effective that they might still
transform the way campaigns do business.

 &HT;    JAN. 4 MAY BRING BIGGEST Y2K HEADACHE FOR AIR TRAVELERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

   WASHINGTON _ Air travelers who hoped to avoid Y2K hassles on New
Year's Day by booking flights three days later may face other
troubles. Airlines expect Tuesday, Jan. 4 to be the busiest day of
the holiday travel season, with some 2 million people packing the
nation's airports.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, many travelers delayed their homeward-bound trips to
avoid possible service disruptions involving the Y2K bug, a
computer software flaw that could cause some computers to
malfunction when the date rolls over to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than rush back after New Year's, ``people are stretching
out their vacations,'' Delta Air Lines spokesman Kip Smith said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association (ATA), an industry trade group
based in Washington, forecast this week that 34.2 million people
will board planes during the two and a half weeks encompassing the
holidays. That would be about 700,000 passengers more than last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Before Christmas, the busiest travel days will stretch from
Friday, Dec. 17 to Monday, Dec. 20, with daily load factors _ the
proportion of seats offered that were sold _ hitting 83 percent. A
normal load factor is 74 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The least busy day will be New Year's Day, with just 1.3 million
passengers boarding planes.
</P>
<P>
   While Jan. 1 is always a relatively quiet travel day, concerns
about the Y2K bug will likely make the first day of 2000
particularly low-key, ATA spokesman David Fuscus said. He noted
that while overall planned holiday travel is up from last year,
travel on New Year's Day is down significantly from last year's
figure of 1.6 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the big drop in passengers Jan. 1, major airlines
have been cutting the number of scheduled flights. For example,
Delta is scheduling 18 percent fewer _ significantly more than last
year's 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At a Thursday press briefing about the air traffic control
system, the Federal Aviation Administration's top Y2K expert, Mary
Powers-King, said flight reductions would not cause any FAA
staffing cutbacks. ``We plan business as usual,'' she said. In
fact, the FAA will have extra staff on duty to make sure all
systems operate well during the date rollover.
</P>
<P>
   She said the FAA completed its software fixes in June, and since
that time has ``tested and retested'' all systems. ``We believe we
are in excellent shape,'' she said.

<P>
   DALLAS _ The words and music have stuck in my mind for 40-odd
years, because they seemed so apt. Frank Loesser wrote them for a
musical called ``The Most Happy Fella,'' and they stopped the show
every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're from Big D I can guess,'' a brassy dame sang, ``by the
way you drawl and the way you dress. You're from Big D, my, oh yes.
I mean Big D, little a, double l, a, s. And that spells Dallas, my
darlin', darlin' Dallas ... where every home's a palace, 'cause the
settlers settle for no less.''
</P>
<P>
   Big money, big hair, big talk. Such is the lingering stereotype
of this city. It occupies a sizable spot in the national
consciousness as the home of the big, bad Dallas Cowboys, of J.R.
Ewing and Miss Ellie and all the gang at Southfork, and of the
little guy with the big ears and bigger ambition, H. Ross Perot,
who was a billionaire before he turned 40.
</P>
<P>
   And for those old enough to recall the events of November 1963,
it occupies an especially dark corner of memory, as the cursed
place where John F. Kennedy was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Dallas and its smaller sibling, Fort Worth, an unmatched
pair if ever there was one, amount to much more than that. Together
with the little cities that cluster around them like pilot fish,
they constitute the largest metropolitan area in the nation's
second largest state. (Houston is bigger, but its metropolitan area
is slightly smaller.) They boast the largest collection of major
corporate headquarters outside of New York and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Identified with all that is brash, Dallas is also the home of
Neiman Marcus, an emblem of all that is stylish, and of its
impresario, Stanley Marcus, an emblem of all that is civilized and
sophisticated, who still travels alone at age 95. ( Marcus brought
the designer Coco Chanel to Dallas in 1957 for one of his store's
fabulous Foreign Fortnights and reported later that he had found
her a dull luncheon companion.)
</P>
<P>
   Once known as Cowtown, Fort Worth is the home of the Kimbell Art
Museum, the masterwork of the great modernist Louis I. Kahn, with
an exquisite collection of Old Masters in its top-lit galleries. At
the risk of offending fans of the Frick in New York, the Gardner in
Boston and the Phillips in Washington, I would choose it as the
nation's best small museum.
</P>
<P>
   Enormously wealthy, often eccentric men populate the histories
of the two cities: Columbus Marion (Dad) Joiner, who discovered the
largest oil field in the world on Daisy Bradford's farm in Rusk
County; H.L. Hunt, who bought the leases from him for $30,000,
built an empire and spent his old age as a megarich loony, selling
Gastro-Majic indigestion pills at the state fair; and Sid
Richardson, a legendary wildcatter whose great-nephews, the Bass
brothers, have invested it well, amassing a huge fortune and
rebuilding downtown Fort Worth in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is incredibly inventive, endlessly entrepreneurial. Here
Herb Kelleher dreamed up Southwest Airlines, with its low prices
and jokey style (``Austin Auften,'' say the billboards). His planes
have become the Greyhounds of the 1990s. Here a Texas Instruments
engineer named Jack Kilby, who had been with the company too short
a time to earn a vacation, spent July 1958 in the lab and hit upon
the idea of the silicon chip, or integrated circuit, ushering in
what has been called the Second Industrial Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has changed since Harry McPherson was growing up in Tyler,
100 miles east of Dallas. McPherson went to Washington in the
Johnson years and stayed on, writing what is widely considered one
of the best books ever written on the capital, ``A Political
Education'' (1972). And there is much that still rings true about
the description of Dallas that he wrote 20 years ago for The
Atlantic, including this passage:
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as you passed the Buckner Orphans' Home _ I imagined it
full of city kids like Mickey Rooney, presided over by Spencer
Tracy _ you could see the metropolitan skyline. It floated in the
cold autumn sunlight, or trembled in the waves of summer heat.
Dallas. Mysterious. Rich. Full of merchants, criminals and
transplanted country boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas took a pasting in the second half of the 1980s. ``They're
going to go broke, making all of these crazy loans,'' Theodore H.
Strauss, the businessman-brother of Robert S. Strauss, the Dallas
and Washington lawyer and politico, remembers telling his friends.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. One by one, the big Dallas banks, overextended,
stuck with worthless real estate and energy paper, were forced to
turn to Washington or out-of-state holding companies for rescue.
Finally, not a single locally owned bank was left, only
subsidiaries of the big outfits in New York, and Charlotte, N.C.,
and Columbus, Ohio. A lot of proud old Dallas families watched
fortunes vanish.
</P>
<P>
   There were other shocks. Walker L. Railey, the minister of the
First United Methodist Church, one of the largest in the nation,
was accused of choking his wife, leaving her in a permanent
vegetative state. He had been the golden boy of the religious
community in a city where religion counts for a lot, where a
broadcasting network ornaments its offices at Christmas with red
tinsel letters spelling out the words, ``Happy Birthday, Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   So the downfall of Railey, who tried to commit suicide,
confessed to an affair with the wife of another minister and then
left town with her, staggered the city almost as much as the big
banks' collapse. Even when a jury acquitted him.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the scandal at Southern Methodist University.
Southern Methodist is another of the city's defining institutions,
as pivotal in its way to Dallas as Harvard is to Boston. With its
splendid Meadows Museum of Spanish art, it lies at the heart of the
enclave, north of downtown, known as Park Cities _ Highland Park
and University Park. Conservative, wealthy, snobbish, the Park
Cities are also known as ``the Bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   As its residents see things, scandals belong to the messy world
outside the Bubble, not the orderly one inside, but it emerged in
1987 that Southern Methodist had been illegally paying its football
players. Worse, the board of trustees, led by Gov. William P.
Clements Jr., had known of the payments and had contrived an
elaborate scheme of bribes to cover them up. The National
Collegiate Athletic Association imposed the toughest sanctions in
its history, and Southern Methodist, which had produced gridiron
immortals like Doak Walker and Don Meredith, fielded no football
team at all for two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   As John Steinbeck wrote in ``Travels With Charley,'' in 1962,
``Football games have the glory and the despair of war, and when a
Texas team takes the field against a foreign state, it is an army
with banners.'' In war, rules are often bent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of metaphor of how far things can get out of hand
when people are so highly focused on competition, success, being
No. 1,'' Dr. Leroy T. Howe, the president of the university's
faculty senate, commented at the time. ``In Dallas, the people who
aren't winning are losing.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ People following the news on New Year's weekend
will likely see a lot about John Koskinen, the White House's Y2K
czar.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Friday, Dec. 31, Koskinen will be telling Americans
how the world is coping as the clock moves past midnight in each of
the world's 24 time zones, gradually ushering in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But once New Year's weekend is over, Koskinen hopes few
Americans will remember his name. If that turns out to be true, he
says he will see it as a signal that the United States experienced
relatively few Y2K-related glitches.
</P>
<P>
   But if Y2K calamities erupt across the nation, he worries that
he would be blamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I'll) be the person they point fingers at if everything goes
wrong,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen, 60, has spent the last 21 months making sure that
dozens of federal agencies were fixing their computers to properly
read the digits ``00`` as 2000, rather than 1900. Failure to read
the correct date could cause date-based computers to shut down,
potentially creating havoc in such key systems as air traffic
control and electrical power distribution. This is the crux of
concerns about Y2K, a shorthand for year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   During the next two weeks Koskinen will put the finishing
touches on a $50 million federal command center that will act as
the nation's Y2K clearinghouse starting Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 people at the center near the White House will be
responsible for collecting information from other parts of the
federal government as well as private industry about how the world
is faring as it moves into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department will likely be the first agency reporting
into the center shortly after New Zealand becomes the first major
country to enter the New Year at 6 a.m. EST on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen has been spending most of his 15-hour workday
overseeing the design of the nuts-and-bolts operation of the
command center. It involves testing the newly installed computer
system that will connect with other government computers scattered
around the Washington, D.C. area.
</P>
<P>
   He answers more than 100 e-mails a day and continues to have
meetings and conference calls with everyone from Washington, D.C.'s
mayor to federal agency heads to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen says he is confident that there will be relatively few
Y2K-related problems in the United States, although he can't say
the same for some other countries. But when Koskinen began his job
in March 1998, he admits he was ``a little nervous.'' That's
because important government operations such as the air traffic
control system or the agency that manages Medicare and Medicaid and
the Defense Department ``were thought to be lost causes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people suggested that lagging agencies like the Federal
Aviation Administration _ which runs air traffic control _ simply
forgo fixing its computers and draft plans to manually run air
traffic control.
</P>
<P>
   Under Koskinen's leadership, the FAA, the Defense Department and
rest of the federal government did fix their computers and are
expecting normal operations on Jan. 1, 2000. In fact many of those
computers have been properly reading the year 2000 since the
government's new fiscal year began Oct. 1 of this year.
</P>
<P>
   While Koskinen's job description only required him to be
responsible for the federal government, he quickly realized that it
didn't matter if government computers worked if widespread power
outages and food shortages disrupted Americans' lives, as some were
predicting would happen.
</P>
<P>
   He assembled a Y2K task force of key private industry groups
including airlines, banks, electric power, oil and gas and the
pharmaceutical industry to make sure that private industry was
prepared for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   He also became a Y2K czar of sorts for state governments, too.
That's because many federal benefits, such as Medicare and food
stamps, are distributed through the states
</P>
<P>
   And Koskinen also was called on to help oversee the District of
Columbia's Y2K conversion efforts. The district government didn't
start overhauling its computers until this year and isn't expected
to be completely ready by the year's end. However D.C. has
elaborate contingency plans to keep city services like 911
emergency telephone operations functioning smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming the nation's Y2K czar, Koskinen has tried to keep
his dry sense of humor to help him cope with the demands of his
job.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, during a question-and-answer session
after he delivered a speech, an audience member asked whether the
city of Washington, D.C. was ready. Koskinen, a D.C. resident
himself, deadpanned, ``It's important to remember that the basic
infrastructure (the subway, power and phone system) is not run by
the district government.'' The audience erupted in laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said he has enjoyed the challenge of helping to ensure
that the United States is ready for Y2K. In less than two weeks he
will find out how well he met the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't spend more than 25 years in the private sector
rebuilding large failed companies or managing two federal shutdowns
if you don't have a slightly masochistic tendency to look for
bigger and bigger challenges,'' he said. ``And they don't come any
bigger than Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen, a Yale-educated lawyer, spent 21 as president of the
Palmieri Co., which specializes in turning around companies with
financial problems. His clients included the Penn Central railroad
and the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co., the largest failed
insurance firm in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, President Clinton tapped him to serve as deputy
director of management at the White House's Office of Management
and Budget, a post he held until 1997. While he was at OMB, parts
of the federal government were shutdown in 1995 and 1996 when the
Congress and Clinton failed to reach agreement on a federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said he left his OMB job to travel with his wife,
Patricia. ``I had never taken more than two weeks vacation a
year,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   But his trip was cut short when President Clinton tracked him
down in Amsterdam in January 1998, to ask him to return to
government. Koskinen will likely remain in his post until March.
After that Koskinen plans to resume his travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time I won't leave a forwarding address,'' he said

 DALLAS: are losing.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dallas is booming again. You see it vividly in the procession of
shiny new buildings marching along the so-called Platinum Corridor,
a 14-mile stretch of the Dallas North Tollway from the L.B.J.
Freeway to Plano. This is now one of many economic nodes of the
Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, as it is known.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered along the freeways, amid the barbecue joints and the
used-car lots, with their flags the size of basketball courts, are
the headquarters of companies like Frito-Lay and Exxon, J.C. Penney
and American Airlines, Texas Industries and Electronic Data
Systems, and scores of little companies in the computer, software,
Internet and communications businesses. Alcatel, Nortel, Nokia and
Ericsson all have offices on the North Tollway.
</P>
<P>
   But things have changed. Dallas is no longer so closely tied to
one business, as it once was to cotton, and then to oil, and then
to aerospace, and the bankers and developers have learned the value
of caution. They are not quite so eager to make or take loans
secured mostly by thin air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call ourselves `the city without boundaries,' but we're
growing up a little,'' said Gail Thomas, founder of the Dallas
Institute of Humanities and Culture. ``Dallas dreams big dreams; it
always has. You come here with a little idea, and it turns into a
big one. But there's a new realism.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard times produced some new and different leaders. At the low
point, with oil prices at rock bottom and the patriarchy in
retreat, the city turned to a woman, Annette Strauss, wife of
Theodore Strauss, as its mayor. She promptly got dozens of new arts
projects moving. And then Dallas, a little to its own surprise,
elected a black man, Ron Kirk, to succeed her.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Trinity River, the British weekly The Economist said not
long ago, ``bisects the city of Dallas as certainly as an ocean.''
Highland Park's whites enjoy average household incomes of more than
$200,000 a year; in largely black and Hispanic South Dallas, the
figure is a measly $11,350. Poor education takes a toll. Latinos
will make up the majority of the city's work force by 2010, but
today only 1 percent of high-tech employees are Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Dallas is another difficult problem for Kirk.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and law offices _ including Robert Strauss' powerhouse
firm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld, with more than 900 lawyers
_ bring thousands of workers into the area by day, but by night the
sidewalks are eerily empty. New high-rise apartment blocks are
going up in and around the center of town, and the red Pegasus
sign, a landmark since 1934, is soon to be reinstalled atop the
recently renovated Magnolia Hotel. But Neiman Marcus' store looks
lonely amid shabby neighbors; hoped-for new restaurants and
theaters have not arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, a new arts center may be part of the answer, but it
has been a long time a-coming.
</P>
<P>
   The arts center's linchpin is the 2,062-seat Morton H. Meyerson
Symphony Center, named by its principal donor, Perot, for one of
his business colleagues, who sings in the Dallas Symphony Chorus.
Designed by I.M. Pei, it combines the sharp angles of the National
Gallery's East Building in Washington with swelling glass
``blisters'' that allow sunlight to penetrate into restaurants and
lobbies. There are echoes of Garnier's Paris Opera in its
monumental exterior, and touches of Josef Hoffmann in the interior,
which is richly paneled in warmly hued woods.
</P>
<P>
   Both the building and its acoustics have won the affection of
the city, as has Andrew Litton, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra's
40-year-old conductor. New York-born, he reminds me of Leonard
Bernstein both in his athleticism on the podium and his fondness
for dramatic musical effect. He made his reputation with the
Bournemouth Symphony in England, which accounts for the frequent
appearance of Walton and Elgar on his programs.
</P>
<P>
   Only 25 years ago, the orchestra was in such stormy financial
straits that it had to suspend operations for a year. But at a time
when many orchestras face shrinking audiences, Dallas runs a solid
surplus, with subscription sales near 100 percent. It records
regularly, appears every year in Carnegie Hall and tours Europe _
all of the things that the big guys do.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Opera has no splendiferous new home, although the
arts center's master plan calls for one. For the moment, the opera
plays in the barny old Music Hall at Fair Park, a building with all
the charm and acoustical subtlety of an airplane hangar. Still, it
manages accomplished productions like last year's ``Katya
Kabanova'' and this year's ``Walkure,'' which starred James Morris
as Wotan. Next year, it will gain a new leader, Anthony
Whitworth-Jones, who served as the chief executive officer of the
much-admired Glyndebourne Festival Opera in southern England.
</P>
<P>
   A new leader has already arrived at the Dallas Museum of Art:
John R. Lane, who put the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art on the
map. He inherits a collection comprehensive in scope but uneven in
detail, with strong pre-Columbian and decorative arts departments
and several stellar individual paintings, including Mondrians
stretching from the early, representational style to the
neo-plastic masterpiece ``Place de la Concorde''; van Gogh's golden
``Sheaves of Wheat,'' and Hopper's evocative ``Lighthouse Hill.''
The highlight may be Frederic E. Church's immense, chill-inducing
canvas, ``The Icebergs,'' which was rediscovered in England and
bought in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Next door is a real jewel, a small museum of Asian art
established last year by Trammell Crow, one of the world's largest
real estate developers. The jade, the crystal ball (the world's
second-biggest, after one in the Smithsonian) and above all the
18th-century sandstone facade of a Rajasthan palace are don't-miss
attractions. Installations are immaculate. Memories of 1963
</P>
<P>
   Many come to Dallas to see the grassy knoll near which Kennedy
was killed, ``allegedly,'' as an official plaque puts it, by a shot
fired by Lee Harvey Oswald. Dallas still has doubts. In addition to
the city-backed Sixth Floor Museum, which shows
assassination-related articles like the camera used by Abraham
Zapruder to film the shooting, there is also a privately run
Conspiracy Museum nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had a mean streak in the 1960s; Lyndon B. Johnson was
jeered and spat upon in downtown Dallas in 1960, and Adlai E.
Stevenson was hit on the head with a placard by right-wing
demonstrators in 1963. Douglas Kiker, then a reporter for The New
York Herald Tribune, covering President Kennedy's visit, said after
the president was shot: ``If I had the power to, I'd call the
bombers over this place. How could a thing like this happen?''
</P>
<P>
   But of course Dallas did not kill Kennedy, any more than Los
Angeles killed his brother Robert.

 DALLAS: brother Robert.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven years afterward, a memorial designed by Philip Johnson and
paid for by 50,000 people across the country was opened a few
blocks from the knoll. It consists of four 30-foot-high concrete
walls, with narrow openings on two sides and an unadorned gray
granite cenotaph at its center. Some find it moving; some find it
sterile. Everyone finds it grubby with age, and early next year, a
long-overdue, $70,000 cleanup is scheduled to start.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose Houston buildings helped define that city's sleek
skyline, has designed a number of duds in Dallas, including the
Bank One tower, a weird neo-Palladian effort, and Crescent Court,
which marries lacy New Orleans ironwork to a monstrosity of a
mansard roof. Johnson once said (jokingly?) that he saved all of
his best ideas for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Other well-known architects have misfired here, too, like
Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill, with a skyscraper pierced for no
apparent reason by a huge keyhole-shaped opening, and Frank Lloyd
Wright, whose Dallas Theater Center (completed in 1959) is
watered-down Guggenheim-ery. (Which is by no means to denigrate the
quality of the dramatic productions mounted there; the company,
heir to the tradition of Margo Jones, a regional theater pioneer,
is capably run by Richard Hamburger, son of Philip, the New Yorker
writer.)
</P>
<P>
   Pei's glittering, glass-sheathed Fountain Place, surrounded by
water terraces created by Dan Kiley, is the best high-rise in town,
just as Meyerson Hall is the best low-rise. But his Brutalist City
Hall, built in 1978, already looks dated.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable set of buildings in Dallas is the 26
Art Deco structures on the 127-acre Texas State Fairgrounds,
including the Cotton Bowl and the Hall of State, a celebration of
the state's gaudy history. For 24 days each fall, tens of thousands
of country folk, and thousands of others pretending to be, come to
ride the Ferris wheel and see the rodeo. Museums on the Rise
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, pride of place goes to the Kimbell. Kahn's long,
vaulted, refined galleries in oak, travertine, concrete and
stainless steel work as well today as the day they were built
(1972). Miraculously, every single picture in the building is worth
seeing, and almost all of them _ the Duccio, the Mantegna, the two
Georges de la Tours, the Caspar David Friedrich (the only one in an
American museum) and the magisterial ``Cardsharps'' of Caravaggio _
were acquired in the 1970s, '80s and '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Fort Worth museums are rebuilding, with the ubiquitous
Johnson doing the honors for the Amon Carter Museum, which focuses
on American art, Western and otherwise, and Tadeo Ando, the
respected Japanese architect, designing a new home for the Museum
of Modern Art. The city, which was once the southern terminus of
the Chisholm Trail, has clearly grown well beyond its colorful old
stockyards and its raucous, gargantuan honky-tonk, Billy Bob's
Texas. Even beyond its longtime slogan, ``Where the West Begins.''
</P>
<P>
   People call Fort Worth ``Bassville.'' The Basses have given it a
new performance hall, named after their father, Perry, with
limestone angels on the facade blowing immense brass trumpets. A
pastiche of Secession, Beaux-Arts and postmodern styles, it is much
loved locally, but I agree with a Dallas critic who termed it a
romance novel of a building.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' latest benefactor is Raymond Nasher, a developer whose
collection of modern sculpture, widely viewed as the world's best,
was courted by major museums from New York to Washington to San
Francisco. Instead, he is building a museum and garden across from
the Dallas Museum of Art to house a rotating selection of his
Matisses and Ernsts, Calders and Miros and Dubuffets, now displayed
in and near his brick-and-glass home in northern Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The architect is Renzo Piano, the Italian who designed the
superb Menil museum in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment,'' Nasher said, ``Dallas has nothing of real
artistic significance, internationally. Perhaps this can be it.
This is a nice city, but it's mostly about money. We're hoping to
change that a little.''

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. (star) denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings
and running times are in parentheses.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER,'' starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa
Paredes, Antonia San Juan and Penelope Cruz. Directed by Pedro
Almodovar (R, 101 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   A whole new order of Almodovar extravaganza. The antic fizz and
theatrical exaggeration of this filmmaker's earlier work have
blossomed into a newly sophisticated style, one that is far more
wise and deeply felt. Lovingly dedicated to actresses who have
played actresses, this film weaves its own soap opera around ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'' and tells of splendidly resilient women;
Almodovar has aptly described his material as ``screwball drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich and entertaining, this story celebrates the power of
artifice and impersonation to transcend ordinary truth. The
irrepressible Ms. San Juan, a Spanish nightclub performer, plays a
transsexual named Agrado and is the film's biggest treat (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``BOYS DON'T CRY,'' starring Hilary Swank and Chloe
Sevigny. Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This stunning debut feature tells the strange and resonant story
of Brandon Teena, who despite being born Teena Brandon went on to
create a charismatic identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately
wrenching tale may sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into
Theodore Dreiser's idea of American tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The film makes it hauntingly real and even tenderly romantic,
with the astonishing acting needed to make it work. One of the
year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``THE CIDER HOUSE RULES,'' starring Tobey Maguire,
Charlize Theron and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Lasse Halstrom
(PG-13, 125 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Radically downsized in scope, and its examination of the issue
of abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with a
Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely
World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent raised in an
orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who performs
abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple (Ms.
Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but
smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a 40s
``David Copperfield'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``CRADLE WILL ROCK,'' starring Emily Watson, John Turturro,
Ruben Blades, John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Bill Murray and Vanessa
Redgrave. Written and directed by Tim Robbins (R, 132 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This huge Depression-era story features well-known figures from
Orson Welles to Nelson Rockefeller to Diego Rivera, and it works
them into an ambitious ``Ragtime''-like tableau. Though too many
figures in this landscape are reduced to naive caricature, Robbins
and his impressive cast bring strong passions to bear upon this
(mostly) true story of a legendary event: the trouble-fraught
production by Welles and John Houseman of the banner-waving 1936
agitprop musical ``The Cradle Will Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins and his cast play out all sides of this event with the
certitude that its importance lives on (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``THE END OF THE AFFAIR,'' starring Ralph Fiennes,
Julianne Moore, Stephen Rea and Ian Hart. Directed by Neil Jordan
(R, 105 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's intoxicating version of Graham Greene's 1951 novel, in
which an illicit affair becomes a far greater gamble than either
lover could have imagined. For this fearlessly eclectic filmmaker,
this is one more intelligent, brooding love story with a secret
twist.
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes and Ms. Moore breathe life into this story with a
dreamy, erotic intensity that in no way trivializes the film's
underlying ideas about religious faith. Period detail (the setting
is London in the mid-1940s) is sumptuously heightened by the
inspired costume designer Sandy Powell (``Shakespeare in Love'')
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``END OF DAYS,'' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Robin Tunney,
Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollak. Directed by Peter Hyams (R, 118
minutes). The star modestly tackles the role of a new savior who
may just keep mankind free of Satan for the next thousand years.
And that's not even the worst thing about this pointlessly nasty
would-be thriller.
</P>
<P>
   The material is so derivative that it amounts to a tag sale of
used parts from better apocalyptic films, with special credit owed
to ``The Exorcist'' for grisly sacrilegious tricks. Hyams favors a
jack-in-the-box approach to delivering shock value. The star
dutifully protects a nice young woman from demonic forces. But
Byrne plays the swaggering embodiment of pure evil and has the
better role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE GREEN MILE,'' starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan,
David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written
and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In adapting the death row drama that Stephen King wrote in
multiple installments, the director of ``The Shawshank Redemption''
could have managed more economy and fewer talky bits of business
around the cellblock. Still, this lengthy film is vivid and well
played.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth ensemble acting builds up to the discovery that a
gigantic condemned man (Duncan) is a prisoner with very special
abilities, which gives the film its mixture of religious overtones
and mild horror. Hanks, as a wry Southern prison guard, is so
unaffectedly good that it's redundant to say so (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``LIBERTY HEIGHTS,'' starring Adrien Brody, Joe Mantegna
and Ben Foster. Directed and written by Barry Levinson (R, 134
minutes). This semi-autobiographical comedy-drama remembering
teenage life, anti-Semitism and racism in mid-1950s Baltimore is
the fourth movie by Levinson to be set in his native city.
</P>
<P>
   A deeply felt nostalgia trip, the movie adroitly captures the
look and social attitudes of the city 45 years ago. But the
screenplay and performances are too muted for the movie to come to
terms with growing pains cushioned in the nostalgic haze (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``MANSFIELD PARK,'' starring Frances O'Connor and Jonny
Lee Miller. Written and directed by Patricia Rozema (PG-13, 105
minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Rozema's skillful screen adaptation of Jane Austen's
third novel, the protagonist Fanny Price (Ms. O'Connor) has been
sharpened into a proto-feminist heroine who triumphs over the
materialist, patriarchal values of her wealthy relatives through a
combination of wit, beauty and daring.
</P>
<P>
   Without bearing down too heavily, the screenplay (which
incorporates fragments of Austen's letters and diaries) equates
early 19th-century slave trading with the oppression of women. The
message is leavened with smart humor and warm three-dimensional
performances (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``MISS JULIE,'' starring Saffron Burrows and Peter Mullan.
Directed by Mike Figgis (R, 100 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Figgis, whose previous films ``Internal Affairs''
and ``The Loss of Sexual Innocence'' dwelled obsessively on the
darker aspects of sex, August Strindberg's late-19th-century drama
becomes a bleak study of the sexual disgust shared by a rebellious
aristocrat (Ms. Burrows) and the upwardly mobile footman (Mullan)
she taunts into having sex.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie's contemporary cinema-verite style is at odds with
the story and its setting. And Ms. Burrows' coldly haughty title
character is far less compelling than Mullan's earthy, cunning
footman (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``SLEEPY HOLLOW,'' starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci,
Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough
and Christopher Walken. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker and directed
by Tim Burton (R, 110 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This ornate visual fantasy, artfully concocted using a palette
that suggests nuclear winter, has little to do with Washington
Irving's story and everything to do with Burton's macabre vision.
</P>
<P>
   Depp makes a dashing hero as the film's shy detective, but the
story (by the writer of ``Seven'' and ``Fight Club'') is determined
to put the ick into Ichabod Crane.
</P>
<P>
   A first-rate cast and extraordinary technical talents are
attention-getting here, but so is the film's penchant for sardonic
beheadings. It's possible to admire Burton immensely for the secret
tenderness and rich imagination of his work without wanting to peer
at the exposed brain stems of his characters (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``SWEET AND LOWDOWN,'' starring Sean Penn, Samantha Morton and
Uma Thurman. Directed by Woody Allen (PG-13, 95 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In homage to the kind of jaunty 1930's jazz that has been heard
on many of his other films' soundtracks, Allen imagines a
consummate jazz character: Emmet Ray (played with gusto by Penn),
who can play the guitar as gorgeously as Django Reinhardt but lacks
certain interpersonal skills when it comes to his private life.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing attributes of various real musicians, the film turns
Emmet into another one of Allen's cad-geniuses and gives him a
long-suffering mute laundress as a sweetheart. (Ms. Morton works
miracles in her wordless role.)
</P>
<P>
   But on the storytelling level, the film remains flimsy. It's the
musical interludes, frequent and lovingly presented, that keep it
alive (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``TOY STORY 2,'' with the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim
Allen. Directed by John Lasseter; a Pixar Animated Studios film (G,
98 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   A wonderfully playful sequel, sustaining the first film's wit
and novelty while bringing new sophistication to computer-generated
animation. And here is welcome proof that Hollywood can still make
movies to please audiences of any age or persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   From its opening (a perfectly adorable ``Star Wars'' parody) to
its Capraesque conclusion, this is seamless work with more
metaphorical cleverness than that usually found in the toy bin.
Colorful new characters and more adventurous action enhance the
story of how Woody falls into the clutches of a sleazy toy dealer,
experiences newfound celebrity and needs to be rescued by his old
friends (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``TUMBLEWEEDS,'' starring Janet McTeer and Kimberly J.
Brown. Directed by Gavin O'Connor (PG-13, 100 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   An astoundingly vital performance by the British actress Janet
McTeer makes this small, beautifully acted slice of contemporary
Americana a must-see film. Ms. McTeer is Mary Jo Walker, a sexy,
free-spirited woman with four marriages behind her who travels
across the country with her 12-year-old daughter, Ava (Ms. Brown).
</P>
<P>
   Like few other films, this one captures an intimately loving
(though not conflict-free) relationship between a parent and child
without becoming saccharine. The director plays Mary Jo's trucker
boyfriend, who is only the latest in a series of romantic disasters
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``THE WAR ZONE,'' starring Freddie Cunliffe, Ray
Winstone, Tilda Swinton and Lara Belmont. Directed by Tim Roth (not
rated, 99 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Roth is an actor known for roles in tough films, but never for
anything quite as raw as this. In this searing first feature, the
title battlefield is a rural English home where a teenage boy looks
upon his own family with helpless rage and astonishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the incestuous relationship between his father and older
sister, the film's wordless, baleful young hero struggles to come
to terms with this household horror. Understated but extremely
graphic at times, and shot with mournfully expressive simplicity by
Seamus McGarvey (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH,'' starring Pierce Brosnan, Sophie
Marceau, Dame Judi Dench, Robert Carlyle and Denise Richards.
Directed by Michael Apted (PG-13, 128 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This director is much admired for his ``Up'' series chronicling
the lives of former schoolchildren as they mature. And he has
managed to make James Bond grow up a little, too. Brosnan has grown
much more comfortable with the role of Bond, and most of the other
characters are also more interesting than might have been expected.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marceau slinks memorably through the role of a treacherous
oil heiress. Ms. Richards seemed a lot smarter playing high school
vixens than she does as a brilliant scientist here. The itinerary
roams from Scotland to Central Asia. And Apted handles the action
as well as he does the talk (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Film Series
</P>
<P>
   BOGART RETROSPECTIVE. He was a gangster. He was a private eye.
He skippered a fishing boat and ran a cafe in Casablanca. He was,
of course, Humphrey Bogart (1899-1957), the son of a Manhattan
surgeon and a magazine illustrator who achieved stardom in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the occasion of the centennial of his birth, he is the
subject of a retrospective in BAMcinematek, the Brooklyn Academy of
Music's Rose Cinemas' repertory program. This weekend offers two of
his best: Saturday, Raoul Walsh's ``They Drive by Night,'' about
two truckers framed for murder; and on Sunday, John Huston's
``Maltese Falcon,'' with Bogart as the private detective Sam Spade,
drawn into the intrigue surrounding a murder and a priceless
statuette.
</P>
<P>
   Each film is to be shown at 3, 6 and 9 p.m. Screening times are
subject to change. Admission to ``Bogie at BAM,'' through Jan. 30,
is $8.50 for adults and $5 for people over 62, children under 12
and students with valid identification. Information: (718) 623-2770

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Poking fun at Democratic presidential hopefuls Al
Gore and Bill Bradley, the Republican Party on Thursday opened the
``Gore Store'' and ``Bradley Boutique'' for holiday shoppers with a
taste for political sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   The stores offered such items as the ``I Invented the Internet''
mousepad for $15, which mocked Gore's retracted claim than he
invented the World Wide Web, and $15 ``Alpha Male'' baseball caps
that allude to the hiring of a feminist writer by the Gore campaign
to help the vice president appear more masculine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is your chance to grab that last-minute stocking stuffer
or gift for those hard-to-buy-for friends and relatives,'' said Jim
Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee. The party
said proceeds from the one-day sale, which was held at the
committee's headquarters near the U.S. Capitol, will be donated to
the United Way.
</P>
<P>
   Other items for sale at the so-called ``Gore Store'' were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Al Gore business cards at $5 for a pack of 50. The cards make
fun of what Republicans say is the Gore penchant for inflating his
resume. Among the jobs listed on the cards, which bear the quote,
``You name it, I've done,'' were tobacco farmer, homebuilder,
inspirer of the book ``Love Story,'' and Internet inventor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Copies of Gore's book on the environment, ``Earth in the
Balance'' for $10. The book _ which many Republicans consider
alarmist _ comes with a candle, which would be used to read the
book and to save electricity.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $20 computer from the 1980s, before the Internet was broadly
available for use.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Bradley Boutique'' offered only one product: A Bill
Bradley Speech Survival Kit. Making fun of what even Bradley admits
are his less than scintillating speaking skills, the $10 kit
includes a coffee mug with a picture of the candidate on it, along
with a bag of high-caffeine coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're listening to a Bradley stump speech, this gift could
be the difference between you and an hour-long nap,'' said
Nicholson, who wore a red Santa hat.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the rush of Republican holiday shoppers at the
store, the most popular item was the mousepad, which has a picture
of Gore next to a computer saying, ``I invented the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just such a ridiculous statement,'' said Mike Newman, a
political consultant in Washington. ``I laugh every time I think of
him saying that, so now I have it next to my computer, which I
think Gore invented as well.''
</P>
<P>
   With about half of the merchandise sold, Nicholson announced
that the RNC had achieved its goal of raising $353, the amount Gore
reported giving to charity on his 1997 tax return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit it wasn't the hardest goal to reach, but it took Al
Gore a whole year to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the Gore campaign could be reached for comment on the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   A Bradley campaign official called the Republican event
``silly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a perfect contrast between the Republicans and
Bill Bradley,'' said Bradley spokesman Tony Wyche. ``While they're
selling gimmicks, Bill was talking how to get special interests out
of the political process.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, as recently as the 1970s, people did not live
on the street in cardboard boxes with their feet sticking out the
end. Homelessness, always with us but nowhere near as rampant as it
is today, was essentially invisible. Then a combination of
circumstances, including the emptying of mental institutions and
cutbacks in federal funds for housing, drove all sorts of people
onto the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers were on the case almost immediately. Street
photographers and photojournalists hail from a long tradition of
social observation, reporting and reform; and the combination of
real compassion and excitement at finding the picturesque poor
suddenly publicly available lured crowds of students and
professionals to the new haunts of the unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Today, just when you thought that crowds of the homeless in New
York were about to be carted off to jail, along comes the
pronouncement that there are other ways to handle the problem.
Curiously, that message is being delivered not by the press, an ad
or an advocacy group, but by a museum, in this case the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington. Not so curiously, the existence of
despair and the potential for hope are given visual form at the
museum by photographers.
</P>
<P>
   The art museum at the century's end is a mixed institution if
ever there was one, a place where art, most commonly in the guise
of photography, joins social agendas and serves them. Public
museums have almost always had a social agenda, many having been
founded to educate the populace about art and improve the level of
culture and taste. But they did not specifically address the issues
of poverty or mental health or the social ills that beset cities,
nor did they expect their audience to achieve a heightened
awareness of these matters among casts of Greek statues and
paintings by Rembrandt.
</P>
<P>
   Now they do. The Corcoran is presenting ``The Way Home: Ending
Homelessness in America,'' an exhibition of some 150 images by 13
photographers, organized by the gallery in association with the
National Alliance to End Homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   The photographers _ Jodi Cobb, Donna Ferrato, Ben Fernandez,
Betsy Frampton, Annie Leibovitz, Mary Ellen Mark, Eli Reed, Joseph
Rodriguez, Stephen Shames, Callie Shell, Diana Walker and Clarence
Williams, as well as Tipper Gore, who has been active in this cause
_ had their expenses covered but contributed their time.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Brookman, the Corcoran's curator of photography and media
arts, and Jane Slate Siena, the head of institutional relations at
the Getty Conservation Institute in Los Angeles, were co-curators.
The show is accompanied by a book published by Harry N. Abrams,
which is donating proceeds from the sales to the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good show and a worthy one but photographically
uneven. All the work fits respectably within a tradition of
concerned photography, and the roster of photographers is
distinguished, but not all are represented by their best work.
Individual pictures by various photographers, including Ms. Mark,
Reed, Fernandez and Rodriguez, are gripping; Ms. Cobb's color is
startling; Ms. Ferrato's essay is informative. But some of the
photographs are the kind of link pictures that get you from one
place to another in an essay, necessary but not necessarily
arresting.
</P>
<P>
   In a show meant to demonstrate that there are solutions to
homelessness _ some put forward by organizations that provide not
just shelter but also crucial services like medical care,
psychological support and job training _ the entire exhibition may
be more important than individual pictures. At any rate, it has
never been clear how important aesthetics are to persuasion or even
to certain kinds of information. Context is all in such an
undertaking, and the texts add valuable information that the
photographs alone could not supply. Some of the successes achieved
by advocates for the homeless are pictured in the Corcoran show,
which maintains a fragile balance between pictures of homelessness
and of the way home.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to reconcile palaces of high art with the poverty
and distress at the margins of society. The Corcoran has devised an
ingenious setting for ``The Way Home,'' with several open-work
structures within the museum's classical galleries. These are built
of two-by-six boards with sheetrock panels nailed to them, like
frameworks for houses; photographs are displayed on the panels. Yet
disjunctions cannot be helped; one room opens onto the Salon Dore,
a late 18th-century confection of white and gilt and delicious
excess, disporting next to a world of drug abusers living in what
is politely called their outdoor living room.
</P>
<P>
   Until 10 years or so ago, museums thought they knew who their
audience was, and it wasn't a true cross section of the urban
population. After all, inner-city residents seldom even turned up
in appreciable numbers in the collection's images, much less in
person. But museums were put under pressure to serve wider
audiences by the National Endowments, foundations, local
governments and some of their own curators and directors, who had
come of age in the activist 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Precedents for socially conscious shows in museums go back to
the 1960s and even earlier, but raising social consciousness has
recently become part of the museum's function. In its statement of
three-year goals for 1998-2000, the American Association of Museums
pledged to ``continue to promote diversity in museum staff,
programs, governance and audiences'' and to ``work with museums to
explore the changing relationship between museums and the community
at large.''
</P>
<P>
   People who have never been in museums may come for one show _ a
group that aids the homeless is bringing their clients to the
Corcoran _ then may or may not ever come back. But at least those
who feel that society doesn't care gain a sense, however fleeting,
that someone is paying attention, and perhaps the regular museum
audience gets a glimpse of lives they seldom see.
</P>
<P>
   Photography has been the natural entryway into this new
community outreach, which gained impetus after the absorption of
photojournalism into museum programs. The Corcoran, which had a
show about homelessness in 1988, has also had shows on runaway
children and hospice care. The Museum of Photographic Arts in San
Diego has mounted shows on poverty in America and commissioned
photographers from the United States and Mexico to take pictures
along the border, then invited local religious, charitable and
advocacy groups to see the material beforehand and figure out what
use they could make of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston has an affiliation with a
local high school that includes putting on a yearly show of student
photography. A few students have gone on to college with
photographic scholarships. Other museums are finding their own
innovative ways to address a new mission.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be a brave new world, but it is a new world for
museums. They have to tend to their traditional missions, too. But
for a few short weeks Rembrandt is taking care of himself, and home
is where the art is.

&HT;     U.S. TRUST IN RUSSIAN NUKES IS NOT BASED ON VERIFICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pentagon officials said Thursday they are confident
Russian nuclear weapons won't be launched accidentally because of
year 2000 computer glitches, but they admitted that they base the
judgment mainly on Moscow's verbal assurances rather than on
independent verification.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our confidence is based on what they tell us,''
Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know in theory how their systems work, and we know a fair
amount about some of the details,'' Hamre said at a news conference
to announce that most all U.S. military weapons and support gear
are Y2K-compliant, meaning they won't fail because of computer
problems on Jan.1.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate Y2K nightmare scenario that both governments say is
unlikely is the launch of Russian intercontinental ballistic
missiles triggered by Russian radars that, during year's rollover
period, mistakenly perceive that Moscow is coming under attack from
U.S. missiles. Russia's nuclear policy, like America's, calls for
launching a retaliatory strike upon determining that an offensive
nuclear attack is under way.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem refers to the possibility that computers
programmed to read only the last two digits of a year might
interpret 2000 as 1900 and then crash.
</P>
<P>
   Hamre said that when the Russians ``tell us that there is no
chance that their radar systems are all of the sudden going to plot
trajectories of incoming ICBMs, we believe them. We can't imagine
how that would happen, knowing what we know about them, as well. We
really do not worry about Russia's missiles going off,'' he
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Pentagon has supplied Russia with $10 million worth
of assistance to help ensure Y2K compliance of nuclear weapons and
a network of early warning radars, Hamre said that Russian
officials ``have been genuinely apprehensive'' about allowing U.S.
officials to enter their classified facilities to double check.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have the same reticence to let them come in and look
at our command and control systems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Verga, a deputy under secretary of defense, added that,
``We have 100 percent confidence in our side, and we are as
confident in the Russians. They have given us assurances that
they'll be ready on their side.''
</P>
<P>
   However, despite the assurances, some American experts, perhaps
recalling former President Ronald Reagan's warning to ``trust but
verify,'' worry about the condition of Moscow's nuclear force
because of Russia's years of economic chaos. They recall, for
example, the incident in 1995, when that nation's military
initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian scientific rocket
as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President Boris Yeltsin
activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first stages of
preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the Russian armed
forces realized their mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading foreign
policy spokesman in the Senate, said the incident underscored the
fact that ``Russian early-warning capabilities continue to
deteriorate, and this deterioration will be compounded by the
transition to the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week a coalition of arms-control experts and 84 members of
Congress charged that Russia's early-warning radars are in such
disrepair and the troops guarding the nuclear-tipped
intercontinental ballistic missiles so demoralized that the weapons
could be accidentally or deliberately launched at the United
States. The coalition said that Y2K computer problems ``will
heighten the risk of a nuclear exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   To reassure a jittery world and further cut the risk of a
Y2K-related accident, the U.S. and Russian governments have set up
a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at Colorado
Springs, Colo. Next week joint U.S.-Russian crews there will
conduct around-the-clock vigils over consoles and computer screens
that can would alert them to missile launches around most of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In its technical aid to Russia, Verga said, the Pentagon has
worked to ensure that the ``hotline'' communications links will
work. It has also provided Moscow with Y2K-compliant alarm systems
to help guard missile silos and other critical facilities. ``That
equipment has actually been delivered, and some of it is still on
the way,'' Verga said.

<P>
   This is the time of the year when I usually announce the lucky
recipient of the annual GOOF (Greatly Overexposed and Overhyped
Fool) Award, a gigantic trophy made entirely of goat cheese carved
into the image of the original winners, Milli Vanilli.
</P>
<P>
   The GOOF recognizes the scandalous and the shameless, the silly
and the sinful. In the last three years, the winners have been
DENNIS RODMAN, JERRY SPRINGER and MONICA LEWINSKY/LINDA TRIPP,
respectively. You get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   As always, there was no shortage of worthy contenders in 1999,
from JESSE ``The Oddity'' VENTURA to PAMELA ANDERSON SOMETIMES-LEE
to EMINEM to DONALD TRUMP to JAR-JAR BINKS. Normally we'd give each
of these nominees a little write-up, but we've got a whole decade
to deal with here _ so we'll dispense with the speeches and get
right to the opening of the envelope.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; Award for the Year &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the GOOF for 1999 goes to:
</P>
<P>
   The entire cast of ``The Real World: Hawaii''!
(Clap-clap-clap-clap-clap-clap-clap ...)
</P>
<P>
   Never before have we seen such a self-indulgent, self-important,
self-destructive yet telegenic bunch of TV brats. Way to go, kids!
Each week there was a new train wreck of an adventure _ Ruthie the
alcoholic lesbian needs to be rescued by paramedics after passing
out in the shower! Teck and Kaia go skinnydipping in the Jacuzzi!
Ruthie cavorts with Kaia in the cab! Colin and Amaya get it on,
then break up. Amaya chases one of Colin's buddies! Kaia moves on
Matt, who's smitten with Ruthie's twin sister! Meanwhile, Justin _
the gay law student with the mood hair _ flees the house ...
Puleeeeeaaaaasssse!
 &UR; Scandal-Stars of the '90s &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW for the most decadent scandal-stars of the '90s! What a
glittering list of nominees! Please hold your applause _ and your
nostalgic guffaws _ until all the deserving candidates have been
announced.
</P>
<P>
   -- MARION BARRY: Kicked off the decade on a high note when he
was arrested Jan. 19, 1990. The FBI had videotaped him lighting up
a crack pipe in a Washington, D.C., hotel room. Five words that
will live in infamy: ``The b--ch set me up!''
</P>
<P>
   -- PEE-WEE HERMAN: Other celebrities have recovered from more
serious scandals, but after Pee-wee (real name: Paul Reubens) was
caught using himself as his own personal playhouse in a movie
theater in 1991, he disappeared and hasn't been able to recapture
the public's imagination, despite a recurring guest role on
``Murphy Brown'' and several movie roles.
</P>
<P>
   -- JERRY SPRINGER: If he were as pompous as a DR. LAURA
SCHLESSINGER or as sanctimonious as a RUSH LIMBAUGH, Jerry might be
a prime contender for GOOF of the 1990s. But he admits he's the
ringmaster of a circus freak show. That makes it hard to get really
mad at him. Nevertheless, anyone who parades that many jiggling,
trash-talking, cross-dressing cat-fighters in front of a national
audience deserves a GOOF Awards Committee Special Commendation.
</P>
<P>
   -- JENNY JONES: She's a deer-in-the-headlights version of
SPRINGER who doesn't seem to comprehend what she's gotten herself
into and seems incapable of explaining why she keeps hosting her
depressingly trashy show.
</P>
<P>
   -- MICHAEL JACKSON: In the most unholy union in show business
history, the Man in the Surgical Mask married LISA MARIE PRESLEY,
who displayed all the enthusiasm of a PATTY HEARST in the early
days with the SLA. After that marriage crumbled, Jackson wed his
plastic surgeon's nurse and had two children _ Paris and Prince _
before another split-up.
</P>
<P>
   -- KATHIE LEE GIFFORD: Blabber-mouthed Kathie Lee was
temporarily rendered speechless amid all the snickering about her
waxen hunk of a husband, FRANK, groping a busty flight attendant
while a tabloid rag's hidden camera clicked away. She also had to
weather a torrent of negative publicity about her signature line of
clothing being produced in sweatshops _ leading to the bizarre
spectacle of hubbie Frank showing up at one such factory in New
York's Garment District with a bag of cash, which he handed out to
puzzled but grateful workers.
</P>
<P>
   -- LATRELL SPREWELL: This entire column could be filled with a
roster of athletes who disgraced themselves and their sport with
their antics, but we'll let Spree's name represent all the selfish
and stupid jocks whose names landed on the scandal blotter in the
'90s. A top athlete is sometimes referred to as a ``player's
player.'' Spree is a jerk's jerk.
</P>
<P>
   -- DAN RATHER: He's one of the most respected journalists of the
20th century _ and one of the wackiest TV personalities ever.
``Gunga Dan's'' emotional, meandering, iron-man high-wire act on
the weekend of JOHN KENNEDY JR.'s death was one of the most
fascinating pieces of performance art in TV history.
</P>
<P>
   -- DONALD TRUMP: Reacted to the news of PRINCESS DIANA's death
by lamenting that he never got the chance to sleep with her.
Visited a public school in an impoverished neighborhood and dropped
a phony $1 million bill into a donation box as a joke. Dumped MARLA
MAPLES before a prenup clause could kick in, and started dating a
series of idiot models. Actually boasted about the sleazy rock
stars who were trying to have sex with his 15-year-old model
daughter IVANKA. Threatened to run for president, just because.
</P>
<P>
   And he still has the bad hair.
</P>
<P>
   -- SPICE GIRLS: Not since Josie and the Pussycats have so many
chicks done so much with so little talent.
 &UR; Frontrunning GOOF Couples &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of the frontrunners for the big GOOF were fun, and
sometimes not-so-fun, couples:
</P>
<P>
   -- JOEY BUTTAFUOCO and AMY FISHER: At 16, ``The Long Island
Lolita'' proved her love for Buttafuoco by shooting his wife in the
head. And they say kids that age aren't capable of making a
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   -- WILLIAM KENNEDY SMITH and PATRICIA ``Blue Dot'' BOWMAN: The
televised trial and acquittal of Smith _ who was accused of
sexually assaulting Bowman on a Florida beach near the Kennedy
compound after a night of partying with UNCLE TEDDY _ was the first
courtroom media circus of the decade, and set the tone for the
hysterical coverage of subsequent sensational cases.
</P>
<P>
   -- CLARENCE THOMAS and ANITA HILL: He was a nominee for the U.S.
Supreme Court and she was the former staffer who nearly derailed
his appointment in a wild hearing that included mentions of pubic
hairs on cans of Coke, ``The Exorcist'' and one Long Dong Silver,
porn star extraordinaire.
</P>
<P>
   -- WOODY ALLEN and MIA FARROW: Serial adopter Farrow was
horrified to learn that one of her daughters was shacking up with
the formerly funny but now mostly creepy Woody.
</P>
<P>
   -- NANCY KERRIGAN and TONYA HARDING: For one shining moment,
figure skating was as entertaining as the World Wrestling
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   -- JOHN and LORENA BOBBITT: The feisty manicurist temporarily
separated her allegedly abusive husband from his most intimate
organ in the slice-and-dice heard 'round the world.
</P>
<P>
   -- HUGH GRANT and DIVINE BROWN: Grant proved he was clinically
insane by risking his longtime relationship with the otherworldly
ELIZABETH HURLEY for a street corner encounter with a cheap hooker.
</P>
<P>
   -- MARY KAY LETOURNEAU and VILI FUALAAU: The schoolteacher and
the under-age student she seduced now have two children _ which
means that when she's about 50, he'll just be turning 30, and their
kids will be teen-agers. Wacky!
</P>
<P>
   -- MARCIA CLARK and JOHNNIE COCHRAN: He was the nattily attired,
grandstanding defense attorney who delivered the jury to O.J.
SIMPSON. She was the strident, overworked prosecutor who fumbled
more times in the courtroom than Simpson did in his entire career.
You know, there's a fine line between bickering and love; I think
JUDGE ITO should have married those two while he had the chance.
</P>
<P>
   -- ELLEN DeGENERES and ANNE HECHE: They might have gained more
public support if they hadn't practically felt each other up in
front of PRESIDENT CLINTON and acted as if publicizing their
relationship was the biggest act of bravery under duress this side
of Oskar Schindler.
</P>
<P>
   -- BILL CLINTON and GENNIFER FLOWERS: (Not to mention Clinton
and MONICA LEWINSKY. And Clinton and ELIZABETH WARD GRACEN. And
Clinton and HILLARY CLINTON. And Clinton and JANE DOE No. 1.) Let's
just put it this way: If WARREN BEATTY somehow became president,
we'd see more of a traditional family situation in the White House
with that Hollywood lothario in the big chair than we did with the
Clintons in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   So how about a BIG round of applause? For sheer depth of
depravity, the 1990s were perhaps unmatched _ with the possible
exceptions of the 1920s and, oh yeah, the 1170s (... you remember
them).
 &UR; GOOF of the Decade &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On this, there really wasn't much debate, as one man stood above
the rest as the centerpiece of the dominant scandal-story of this
or any other decade in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   His name, of course --- is O.J. SIMPSON. (Clap-clap-clap! Wait
... On second thought, let's not clap.)
</P>
<P>
   In June 1994, the former football great turned grade-B celebrity
either murdered his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ronald Goldman or
was framed by the Los Angeles Police Department in the most
wide-ranging conspiracy since 1963. For more than two years, one
jaw-dropping spectacle after another played out, from the
handcuffing of O.J. to the white Bronco chase to the endless
criminal trial to the civil judgment, with supporting players such
as KATO KAELIN, MARK FUHRMAN, F. LEE BAILEY, PAULA BARBIERI and
FRED GOLDMAN taking their turns on the side stages.
</P>
<P>
   As for O.J., he continues his search for the real killers, who
apparently are hiding out on public golf courses or in the
brassiere of the occasional stupid young blond woman who
idiotically finds him attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, O.J!
</P>
<P>
   You're the runaway winner of the GOOF Award for the 1990s.
Here's hoping you don't have to auction it off, as you did the
Heisman.

as KATO KAELIN, MARK FUHRMAN, F. LEE BAILEY, PAULA BARBIERI and
FRED GOLDMAN taking their turns on the side stages.
</P>
<P>
   As for O.J., he continues his search for the real killers, who
apparently are hiding out on public golf courses or in the
brassiere of the occasional stupid young blond woman who
idiotically finds him attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, O.J!
</P>
<P>
   You're the runaway winner of the GOOF Award for the 1990s.
Here's hoping you don't have to auction it off, as you did the
Heisman.

SOUNDS OF THE SEASON: WHICH CHRISTMAS CDS TO BUY, WHICH TO BANISH
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It's enough to turn anybody into a Scrooge _ having to face the
tall, unsteady pile of seasonal CDs we've accumulated for review in
the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody and their mom is putting their hand to ``Joy to the
World'' and ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'' and a dozen or so
endlessly recorded others _ whether their voices suit them or not.
</P>
<P>
   So our hearts were full of cheer and our stockings full of joy
when a wise editor said (read this aloud with deep, grandfatherly
voice): No, don't worry, just pick 12 for this story.
</P>
<P>
   Now this is a man who understands the spirit of giving, as in
giving us time to do other stuff, like graze whenever high-calorie
seasonal food is brought into the office (which these days is
almost every day) and shop with money we don't necessarily have.
'Tis the season, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Gladdened and mirthful, we divvied 'em up, listened to 'em, came
back and sat down in front of our computers, finding out that _ lo
and behold! _ 13 CDs had actually made our list.
</P>
<P>
   And hark! The deadline approaches!
</P>
<P>

   Garth Brooks, ``Garth Brooks &AMP; the Magic of Christmas,''
Capitol: Garth's second seasonal offering is in keeping with his
recent, poorly conceived foray into pop: Country is often
downplayed here, in favor of strings, horns and a choir on several
songs. Brooks often displays little feel for the material, and his
voice isn't always equal to the task at hand, two glaring examples
being ``It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year'' and ``Let It
Snow.'' The song selection is just the same-old-same-old, and this
CD should appeal to the staunchest of fans and few others.

   Jewel, ``Joy: A Holiday Collection,'' Atlantic: Um, no. Yodeling
Alaskan folk/rock iconess and bad poet Jewel should avoid seasonal
recordings at all costs, based on this 13-song effort. Simplicity
and directness have always served her well, but they're in short
supply here. The overdone string arrangements (Arif Mardin, you are
due a big chunk of coal) often bury her voice and take away from
what could have been a nice, small-scale, folksy effort. Moreover,
Jewel is just not suited to these songs: Listening to her try to
hit the high notes on ``O Holy Night'' is painful. Let's not do
this again, OK?

   Kenny G, ``Faith _ A Holiday Album,'' Arista: The G's spineless,
limp takes on seasonal favorites are, well, neither any better nor
any worse than any of his other material _ drab aural wallpaper,
faux jazz that is, inexplicably, wildly popular. So, then, will
this be _ but that doesn't mean ``you'' have to buy it, unless
you're going for the gag-gift angle for the Miles Davis fan in your
life. And, frankly, this is too expensive for a gag gift.

   George Strait, ``Merry Christmas Wherever You Are,'' MCA
Nashville: A new Christmas album by evergreen George is as welcome
as an old friend on the doorstep. It's been well over a decade
since he first addressed the holidays with ``Merry Christmas Strait
to You.'' That album was a western-swing romp through the holidays,
but ``Merry'' is a more mainstream collection. Don't be frightened
by the overdone standards here: ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer''
and ``Jingle Bell Rock'' get upbeat, jazzy treatments from George.
And his teasing turn on ``All I Want for Christmas (Is My Two Front
Teeth)'' is cute, too. The new material is worthy of more than one
Christmas on the CD player, especially ``Noel Leon,'' a
down-to-earth, conversational tale that will warm hearts all around
with its gentle word play. ``Old Time Christmas'' is bittersweet,
and the title cut of lost love is even sadder. It's a good thing
``I Know What I Want for Christmas'' is playful.

   Ringo Starr, ``I Wanna Be Santa Claus,'' Mercury: Now this is a
Christmas record. Redolent of the late-night recording session and
the wild off-site office party, ``Santa Claus'' is Ringo's first
Christmas record, and it's chock-full of joyous takes on ``The
Little Drummer Boy'' and ``Rudolph,'' PLUS he's written several
originals _ check the Gary Glih stomp of the opener, ``Come
on Christmas, Christmas Come On.'' There's also, yo ho ho, a take
on an obscure Beatles song, ``Christmas Time Is Here Again,'' with
Aerosmith's Joe Perry chipping in a guitar solo. Rock fans looking
to update their cache of seasonal CDs can stop right here.

   Dan Fogelberg, ``The First Christmas Morning,'' Morning Sky:
Another debut Christmas recording, another resounding success.
Fogelberg's foray into seasonal music has a distinct
olde-tyme/medieval air to it and boasts several pretty original
instrumentals, the most luminous being ``Winterskol'' and ``Feast
of Fools.'' The song selection is also consistently rewarding, with
the English lullaby carol ``This Endris Night'' and ``In the Bleak
Mid-Winter'' getting rare airings. Put this on, light a fire,
cuddle up with your sweetie, and enjoy.

   Jimi Hendrix, ``Merry Christmas and Happy New Year,'' Experience
Hendrix: Yes, this is correct _ Jimi does Christmas. Or did,
anyway, 30 years ago this month: Seems that in December 1969 the
Voodoo Chile (with bassist Billy Cox and drummer and current Fort
Worth resident Buddy Miles) taped a medley of ``Little Drummer Boy,
Silent Night'' and ``Auld Lang Syne'' while rehearsing for his
famous New Year's Eve shows at the Fillmore East. The result is
rough, drenched in feedback _ and ultimately well worth a listen or
four. The second, seven-minute take of the same medley (apparently
taped the same day) is even better, with more exploratory guitar.
Also included is the sweet, and actually quite, um, groovy ``Three
Little Bears,'' a Jimi-does-a-children's-tale from May 1968. All in
all, this is an odd, brief little gem that's perfect for the
classic-rock fan on your list.

   Andrae Crouch, ``The Gift of Christmas,'' Qwest Records: This
offering from the Los Angeles-based gospel star is a definite
keeper. Crouch joins with Chaka Khan, Yolanda Adams, Patti Austin,
Kirk Whalum and others to deliver a richly satisfying collection of
favorites and new originals, all hinging on his deft arrangements
and ability to fuse gospel, classical and R&AMP;B. The familiar songs,
such as ``It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,'' are reworked and
invigorated, and the originals, such as ``This Christmas''
(featuring La Chaka) are also well worth hearing.

   Reba McEntire, ``Secret of Giving: A Christmas Collection,'' MCA
Nashville: Christmas concepts that tie into TV specials seem so
contrived (see ``Garth Brooks &AMP; the Magic of Christmas),'' and Reba
joins the crowd here with an album spawned by her network movie
last week, ``Secret of Giving.'' The title cut is nice enough, as
is the Tony Arata-penned ``This Is My Prayer for You.'' The bulk of
the rest is the most pedestrian of holiday fare: ``I Saw Mommy
Kissing Santa Claus'' and ``Up on the Housetop.'' Two
country-at-heart songs really save the day, however. ``The Angels
Sang'' is a working-mom story that will have commuters pulling over
on the freeway to dab at their eyes, and ``Santa Claus Is Coming
Back to Town'' is, well, less than blissful.

   98 Degrees, ``This Christmas,'' Universal: Yet another boy band,
yet another boy-band-sings-a-bunch-of-Christmas-carols record. The
Christmas offering from this momentarily popular foursome differs
little from the one released a year ago by teeny-bop-pop cohorts 'N
Sync: A couple of originals mixed in with predictable traditionals
sung with the syrup turned on, the emotion turned off. Next year
it'll be some other cute-guy-group's turn and 98 Degrees will have
considerably cooled.

   Amy Grant, ``A Christmas to Remember,'' Myrrh Records: On her
latest Christmas disc, Amy Grant ... enlists the help of Sonic
Youth guitarist Thurston Moore and plays a feedback-drenched,
13-minute version of ``Silent Night?'' Does a punk-rock version of
``Jingle-Bell Rock?'' Gets Puff Daddy to produce? Not quite, but
the Grammy/Dove-winning pop singer's third Christmas CD does go
beyond the norm _ with mixed results. A symphony provides most of
the music, giving ``Remember'' a somewhat one-dimensional
heavy-handedness; the over-the-top arrangements also frequently
overpower Grant's voice. On the upshot, Grant's selection of
material is interesting: There's plenty of new stuff, a coupla
faves and, this is the weird thing, two nice instrumentals,
including the mournful, bagpipe-driven ``Highland Cathedral.'' Sure
beats ``Let It Snow.''

   Martina McBride, ``White Christmas,'' RCA: Perhaps trying to
inch her way further into the is-it-pop-or-is-it-country territory
of her recent ``Emotion'' CD, Martina McBride has cut this
string-laden, predictable collection of Christmas chestnuts.
Everything here is either slow and sappy or goes way overboard,
like a Celine Dion commercial. McBride's got a rugged, wide-ranging
voice; too bad she wasted it on bland, Sears-intercom glop like
this. Martina, please come back!

   Bryan White, ``Dreaming of Christmas,'' Asylum Records: This
six-song EP is a stocking stuffer for Bryan White fans and an easy
turn-down for everyone else. Oh, sure, Bryan's fold-out snapshots
from his own Christmases past are so-o-o cute, and ``One Bright
Star (This Christmas Night)'' is ethereal in that high, Bryan White
way. But we can get nice covers of ``I'll Be Home for Christmas''
from so many other sources.

   &UR; GAME OF THE WEEK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Giants (7-6) at St. Louis (11-2)
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are climbing back into the playoff race because of
two things. First, Fassel has the team believing in miracles.
Second, Fassel has worked extensively, sometimes hours a day, with
quarterback Kerry Collins, correcting his faulty mechanics. Collins
is hot and the Giants are hot. The Rams have little to play for
because the team knows it is only a matter of time before they
claim home-field advantage in the playoffs. They may have to wait
until next week.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 20-15
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SATURDAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (5-8) at Kansas City (8-5)
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers are sliding fast, and the Chiefs are peaking.
Kansas City's offensive coordinator, Jimmy Raye, is doing some of
the best play calling in the league, relying heavily on what
coaches like to call ``bully ball.'' The Chiefs line up and ram the
football down a defense's throat, just as they did against
Minnesota on Monday night. In the 1990s when a Chiefs rusher has
over 30 carries, they are 78-5.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs, 20-12
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (4-9) at Carolina (6-7)
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Coach George Seifert is playing his old team, and who
would have thought that when Seifert faced his former employer he
would be fighting for a playoff spot and the 49ers would be dying a
slow death? The Panthers can smell the playoffs. That other stench
is a San Francisco defense that earlier this season allowed
Carolina to score 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers, 28-25
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY 1 P.M. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (3-10) at Tennessee (10-3)
</P>
<P>
   Falcons' coach Dan Reeves keeps flirting with the idea this may
be his last season as head coach of the Falcons. This game may make
his decision a little easier because it will get ugly. The Titans
are not a great team, but they are a solid one. Atlanta will see a
healthy dose of Eddie George, who needs only 85 yards to become the
fourth player in NFL history with at least 1,200 rushing yards in
each of his first four season. Titans quarterback Steve McNair has
been wearing a boot in practice to protect his injured ankle and
should play.
</P>
<P>
   Titans, 30-9
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (8-5) at Chicago (5-8)
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that Lions' quarterback Charlie Batch has a
small fracture in his throwing thumb. The good news is that his
backup, Gus Frerotte, has had a decent season. This game will be
extremely tight. The Bears almost beat Detroit on Thanksgiving Day.
What drives the Lions now are dreams of making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Lions, 17-14
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (12-1) at Cleveland (2-12)
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville running back James Stewart has a sprained left foot
and may not play. But Jaguars fans need not worry. Fred Taylor, who
had 1,223 yards last year, is as great a reserve as there is in the
league. No land mines for Jacksonville in this game _ they win
convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, 35-10
</P>
<P>
   New England (7-6) at Philadelphia (3-11)
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ty Law, who will miss the next two to four weeks with
a broken hand, is the latest piece of bad news for the Patriots.
Coach Pete Carroll will likely be fired at the end of the season.
After last week's loss to Indianapolis, quarterback Drew Bledsoe
apologized to owner Robert Kraft for his poor play. When players
start begging for forgiveness from management, that means trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles, 14-13
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (2-11) at Baltimore (6-7)
</P>
<P>
   Running back Ricky Williams likely will not play again this
season beccase of a variety of injuries. He was a good pick and is
a good player, but this season has been a disaster because the
Saints are so pitiful. Meanwhile the Ravens are beginning to show
why they have so much promise. They aim for their third straight
victories for the first time since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 21-3
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (6-7) at Miami (8-5)
</P>
<P>
   There is always trouble when those anonymous quotes from players
start popping up in the newspaper. That's what is happening in
Miami. There are questions on whether this is Jimmy Johnson's last
year, or Marino's. San Diego has a good defense led by end Raylee
Johnson's five sacks, but Marino has enough to get by and stay in
the playoff hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins, 17-10
</P>
<P>
   Washington (8-5) at Indianapolis (11-2)
</P>
<P>
   There are coaches in the NFL waiting for the Colts to slip. They
will have to keep waiting. Washington has enough offense to stay
with Indianapolis, but the Redskins are much too weak defensively
to stay with the Colts' impressive threesome of Peyton Manning,
Marvin Harrison and Edgerrin James.
</P>
<P>
   Colts, 35-22
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY, 4 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jets (5-8) at Dallas (7-6)
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are playing the role of spoilers, and they are the most
dangerous spoilers in years. The reason is backup quarterback Ray
Lucas _ he has not only proved he is a capable backup but a starter
in this league. His 85.2 rating, which is better than Troy
Aikman's, is third in the conference. Meanwhile, Dallas running
back Emmitt Smith is questionable with a groin injury. The Jets
will end any realistic hope of Dallas' winning the division.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 28-21
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (8-5) at Denver (4-9)
</P>
<P>
   Denver has played hard this season, and most of their games have
been close. This one should be as well. The last four meetings
between Seattle and the Broncos have been decided by seven points
or less. Denver has won 13 of the past 14 games at home against the
AFC West.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos, 19-16
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (8-5) at Arizona (6-7)
</P>
<P>
   A Bills victory means the franchise would be assured of an
eighth winning season in the 1990s. More important, it would keep
them in the playoff race. This is an interesting game to follow.
Both teams are coming off brutal losses, the Bills to the Giants
and the Cardinals to Washington. Arizona's season is pretty much
over. The Bills win because they have more to play for.
</P>
<P>
   Bills, 20-13
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (7-6) at Minnesota (7-6)
</P>
<P>
   This is a position no one expected either team to be in: On the
outside of the playoff race looking in. What is most disappointing
is the Packers' defense. They are giving up 328 yards a game. There
remain rumors that retired Green Bay defensive end Reggie White
wants to bring his cleats back out of the closet. That won't
happen, and if it did, even the future Hall of Famer might not be
able to help this shellshocked bunch.
</P>
<P>

   The chilliest air mass of the season will glide eastward from
the northern Plains into the upper Great Lakes on Friday. A small
dome of frigid weather over Minnesota, which will produce sub-zero
readings Friday morning, will build into southern Ontario. Its
clockwise circulation will direct gelid air across Lake Superior
and Lake Huron, resulting in several snow squalls. As colder air
surges toward the eastern Great Lakes, more snow showers will
develop.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of polar air will stretch from the Ohio Valley
west into the central Missouri Valley. In spite of the chill,
temperatures will still be near seasonal levels across the Midwest.
Low pressure leading the push of colder air will sponsor a few
patches of light snow from northern Illinois to western
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Dry and cooler weather will dominate the South. A stream of
moisture attendant to a stalled front over Florida will produce
thickening clouds and a few showers over the peninsula. A
disturbance near the Texas Coast should bring more clouds and
perhaps a shower onshore.
</P>
<P>
   A large high pressure system over the central Rockies will
transport milder, dry air from the Pacific into the western Plains.
While the morning will be very cold in the valleys of Utah and
Wyoming, ample sunshine should raise readings close to normal.
Offshore winds across southern California will promote warmer
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and wind will return to the Northwest later on as a potent
storm approaches the Washington Coast. Snow levels will continue to
rise in the Cascades causing more flooding.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: A CHILLING END
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, the mercury hovered near zero degrees
Fahrenheit in Grand Forks, N.D. The remarkably mild autumn weather
of 1999 had come to an end. Between mid-October and mid-December
temperatures averaged 9 degrees a day warmer than normal. On
Tuesday, an inch of snow fell at Grand Forks, ending a period of
253 consecutive snowless days, the second longest since records
began in 1941. While a surge of milder air will reach eastern North
Dakota this weekend, a return to Arctic chill and windswept snow is
expected early next week.

`THE GRASS IS BLUE': DOLLY PARTON SHOWS OFF HER VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER COOPER   
 The (Spartanburg, S.C.) Herald-Journal   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dolly Parton is an enigma. Years ago, she traded what could have
been one of the most artistically important careers in country
music history for a successful shot at Hollywood stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Pabulum like her ``Islands in the Stream'' duet with Kenny
Rogers earned more attention than her earlier, more acoustic-based
songs, and the public was less enthralled with even Parton's
biggest hits than with her immediately obvious physical attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in all the hubbub was a voice for the ages, an instrument
that fluttered, then ached, capable of conveying a childlike
innocence or a hardened wisdom. That voice reappeared at times,
especially on ``Trio,'' Parton's gorgeous collaboration with
Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt. But Parton's best work was at
most a side trip from her career's rickety expressway.
</P>
<P>
   More characteristic were bad movies and National Enquirer
articles about weight fluctuations and plastic surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if the music was all but over when Parton bought up
some land in the Tennessee mountains and opened the Dollywood theme
park.
</P>
<P>
   But something happened on the way to musical irrelevance.
</P>
<P>
   Parton had helped the country music industry toward an obsession
with sex appeal and salaciousness. By the mid-1990s, it was clear
that, marvels of cosmetic alterations be damned, a 50-something sex
symbol was about as marketable as a 10-year-old computer. In
essence, Dolly had made the rules that forced her out of the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of commercial appeal freed her from the musical
straightjacket that currently binds all that emanates from Music
Row, though, and Parton realized that she could now be as
successful marketing good music through independent channels as she
could marketing fluff through giant corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's the right reason for doing the right thing is
debatable. But the exercise of singing for the song instead of the
money can be cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   If you happen to be Dolly Parton, it can also be monumentally
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to ``The Grass Is Blue'' (Sugar Hill Records),
an absolutely essential bluegrass album that restores everything
that once was righteous about Dolly.
</P>
<P>
   Take the disc from its case and skip immediately to track three:
Dolly's take on Hazel Dickens' ``A Few Old Memories.''
</P>
<P>
   A band of bluegrass all-stars, including dobro whiz Jerry
Douglas and mandolin hero Sam Bush, back Parton as she sings a
plaintive, waltz-time ballad. She pulls the blue notes, attacks the
long notes, and instills a weary beauty to a classic, lovely song.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Krauss, Patty Loveless, Claire Lynch and others take
guest turns on lovingly arranged harmony vocals, but Parton is the
main attraction throughout ``The Grass Is Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   With this album, Parton allows the listener to peer through the
years, the wig, the whitened teeth and all the rest. In the end,
we're left with what is real. Luckily, that's the best part of all.

   His Life as a Director
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Six years ago, Lasse Hallstrom, the quiet-spoken
director of films including ``My Life as a Dog'' and ``What's
Eating Gilbert Grape,'' was offered the script for John Irving's
adaptation of his novel ``The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom recalled that he had some difficulties with the script
but was too nervous to talk to Irving about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the idea of traveling to Vermont to confront this
literary giant was too daunting for me,'' said Hallstrom, 53. ``I
just couldn't do it. I wouldn't dare. So I turned it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, after a project had fallen apart at the last
moment, Hallstom was looking at a list of films seeking directors.
He saw that ``The Cider House Rules'' was available again after
Irving had made some revisions. ``I got the new script and really
liked it, but there were still some problems,'' he said. ``I
finally had the guts the meet John Irving and convey some thoughts.
And from the first meeting he turned into a wonderful
collaborator.''
</P>
<P>
   His film is a sweet, sprawling, almost Dickensian story about a
young man's journey from an orphanage. The hero (played by Tobey
Maguire) grows up under the tutelage of a good-hearted doctor
(Michael Caine) who delivers babies of unwed mothers and also
performs abortions on request. The film opened last weekend in New
York and Los Angeles, and is expanding around the nation over the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In his review in The New York Times, Stephen Holden called the
movie ``easily the finest adaptation of an Irving novel'' and a
``gentle, beautifully acted fable about a young man's journey into
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At breakfast the other morning at the Four Seasons Hotel in
Beverly Hills, Hallstrom acknowledged that his career in Hollywood
had not been an especially easy one. His most popular films have
been ``My Life as a Dog'' (1985), made in his native Sweden, about
a 12-year-old boy growing up in the 1950s, and ``Gilbert Grape''
(1993), a melancholy drama starring Johnny Depp, Juliette Lewis and
a young Leonardo DiCaprio, whose portrayal of a mentally retarded
boy earned him an Oscar nomination. The two films, while not
especially commercial, still have wide followings.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years several other films have fallen through,
often at the last minute and after months of work. ``I haven't
worked since 1995 and the film `Something to Talk About,''' he
said, referring to the Julia Roberts-Dennis Quaid comedy-drama
about a Southern family. ``I've spent four years developing and
working on different scripts that fell apart for different reasons,
financial and otherwise. I haven't made financially wise decisions
in my career. I maybe put too many eggs in one basket. I've had
some terrible experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom, who is married to the actress Lena Olin and lives in
Bedford, N.Y., in Westchester County, said that Hollywood
executives often viewed him more as an arty director than as a big
commercial filmmaker. ``I'm offered things like `My Life as a
Dog,''' he said with a laugh. ``I'm stuck with children a lot.''
(He has a 23-year-old son studying film in Stockholm, and he and
Ms. Olin have two young children).
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom has struggled to make a film of ``Peter Pan.'' But he
hardly limits his work to films about young people. ``I can do
anything but broad comedy, which I have no interest in,'' he said.
``The story must grip you. The character must grip you. To spend a
year and a half of your life on a film, you've got to be passionate
about the characters.''
</P>
<P>
   He dedicated the current film to his father, Nils Hallstrom, who
died a year ago. He was a dentist and ``frustrated filmmaker,''
Hallstrom said. ``He got me into filmmaking. I'm realizing his
dream.'' Hallstrom's mother, Karin, is a poet and novelist.
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom's early career involved work on Swedish television and
directing several music videos for the Swedish band Abba. This led
to him directing ``Abba: The Movie,'' in 1977 and a half-dozen
other Swedish films. He clearly misses Sweden, but his career is
now centered in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Sweden you have a script, you commit to it, it's a
handshake, and you cast it and start it,'' he said. ``In America
it's so much more complicated. I still can't figure it out. The
financial thing is such a mystery to me. It all becomes a Catch-22.
You have to find the actors to get the money. But if you don't have
the money, you often don't get the actors.''
</P>
<P>
   His next film, for Miramax, is ``Chocolat,'' about a mother and
daughter visiting, and transforming, a French village in the 1950s.
But Hallstrom, who visits Sweden each summer with Ms. Olin, clearly
hopes to return one day full time. ``The door has to be open just
for my sanity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fascination Survives
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1974 that Milos Forman saw the comedian Andy Kaufman.
Forman, a director who has received Academy Awards for ``One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and ``Amadeus,'' said his friend Buck
Henry, the writer, took him to the Improv comedy club in Los
Angeles to see the comedian, then unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most exhilarating and puzzling performance I've
ever seen,'' Forman recalled. ``It was fascinating and irritating
all at once. It was just weird. There was lots of embarrassed
laughter. It was just Andy. It was the first and last time I saw
him live. I saw him many times on television after that, and he
always provoked curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of Forman's fascination with Kaufman, who died of
lung cancer in 1984 at 35, is the director's newest film, ``Man on
the Moon.'' The movie, written by the team of Scott Alexander and
Larry Karaszewski (``Ed Wood,'' ``The People vs. Larry Flynt''),
stars Jim Carrey as the enigmatic comedian, who often unsettled
audiences with humor _ including accents, jokes and Elvis
impersonations _ that somehow seemed to blur the line between
reality and fiction. The movie opens on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Forman said the film project began five years ago, when he met
the actor Danny DeVito at a party and the conversation turned to
Kaufman. DeVito recalled Kaufman's portrayal of Latka in the
television series ``Taxi,'' in which DeVito also appeared. At the
same time DeVito talked about Kaufman's unpleasant alter ego, Tony
Clifton, a Vegas lounge singer who seemed to have a life of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `This is fantastic,''' Forman said. At that moment
Forman and DeVito decided to make a film about Kaufman. ( DeVito,
whose company, Jersey Films, produced the movie, plays George
Shapiro, who was Kaufman's manager.)
</P>
<P>
   Forman said he believed the Tony Clifton character was created
and endured as a separate fictional person because of Kaufman's
awareness that he was dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``My interpretation of Tony Clifton is that Andy was channeling
his anger and range through him,'' Forman said. ``Andy was seeing
doctors eight years before he died. He knew something was wrong. He
didn't smoke. He didn't take drugs or drink. He watched what he
ate. And yet he was sick. So he created this healthy bull, Tony
Clifton, who drank, who ate meat, who was going to survive. That's
my interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous actors wanted to play Kaufman, including Kevin Spacey,
Edward Norton and John Cusack. But Carrey's tryout videotape _
coupled, of course, with his box office clout _ persuaded Forman
and the producers to hire him. ``I didn't dare cast this part
blind,'' said Forman said. ``I asked whoever was interested to send
me a tape of themselves as Andy Kaufman. I got a lot of tapes. Many
of them were wonderful. They nailed him. But Jim Carrey was Andy.
That's all I can tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling Trapped
</P>
<P>
   It was the approach of the millennium that spurred Mike Figgis
to make ``Miss Julie,'' the screen adaptation of the harrowing
August Strindberg drama from the 1890s about the chasm between the
sexes and the interplay of money, sex and power. Figgis, who
directed ``Leaving Las Vegas,'' had intended to make the drama with
Nicolas Cage and Juliette Binoche. They were busy and wanted a
delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You develop things at a certain time,'' Ms. Figgis said.
``It's one thing to do this 100 years late, at the end of 20th
century. It's another thing to do it in the 21st century. Somehow,
the time was right this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, released by United Artists, an MGM company, opened
last week in New York and Los Angeles. It will be released around
the country early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Saffron Burrows, Peter Mullan and Maria Doyle Kennedy
and adapted by Helen Cooper, the film depicts the tormented
relationship between Miss Julie, the self-destructive, frustrated
and imperious daughter of a wealthy count, and the virile footman
whom she goads into a sexual liaison.
</P>
<P>
   Figgis used hand-held cameras, little equipment and as few takes
as possible. ``The psychology of the play is very much like a
prison play,'' he said. ``Characters are confined to one location.
The relationship between theater and cinema is not so distant that
we can't take something with visual limitations like this and turn
it into a film. The challenge is, how do you use the camera to best
advantage?''
</P>
<P>
   For Figgis, the drama is contemporary: about two people locked
in a cruel but desirous relationship. ``It's about the feeling of
being trapped,'' he said. ``Because of Strindberg's genius, by the
end of the story we have equal anger and sympathy for the two main
characters.''

&HT;     BAUER, BUCHANAN URGE TOUGH U.S. POLICY TOWARD CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN   
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Conservative presidential hopefuls Gary Bauer and
Patrick Buchanan promised Thursday that they would be tougher on
China if they were in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer told reporters he intended to step up criticism of his
rivals for the Republican presidential nomination for being
``unable to do anything (on China) other than repeat the mantra of
`trade, trade, trade.'''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Buchanan criticized China for becoming
``increasingly belligerent'' toward political dissidents and
religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the ability to make China succeed or fail,'' Buchanan
said in a speech devoted to foreign policy. ``If the U.S. closes
its market to China tomorrow, (China's) currency would collapse and
its economy would collapse . We would miss next to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   China ships far more goods to the United States than it
receives. The U.S. trade deficit with China amounted to $23 billion
in the first five months of 1999, the highest of any U.S. trading
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a candidate for the Reform Party nomination, also said
U.S.-imposed sanctions against rogue nations such as Iraq, Iran and
Cuba were ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bauer and Buchanan are long-shot candidates for the
presidency. Bauer is running in the single digits in most polls of
the six Republican contenders, well behind Texas Gov. George W.
Bush and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a speechwriter for President Richard M. Nixon in the
1970s, abandoned the Republican party in October to seek the Reform
Party nomination. The party, founded by Texas billionaire Ross
Perot, has yet to carry a state in two presidential elections,
although former pro-wrestler Jesse Ventura won election last year
on the Reform ticket as governor of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bauer and Buchanan represent a barometer of
conservative voters who are a key ingredient of the Republican
electoral base. Many are fundamentalist Christians who have looked
to Bauer and Buchanan on domestic social issues, from outlawing
abortion to reinstituting school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Both reiterated their opposition to abortion, with Bauer saying
``this is going to stick in our throats until we get it right.''
The two men criticized Bush for declining in a debate Monday night
in Des Moines to commit himself, if nominated, to picking an
anti-abortion running mate.
</P>
<P>
   On China, Bauer characterized the world's most populous nation
as more hostile than ever to Taiwan and intent on becoming Asia's
dominant power. The United States can no longer afford to simply
placate China in the name of improved trade relations favored by
American business interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world will be a more dangerous place if we can't come up
with a policy other than the one being dictated in corporate suites
of Fortune 500 companies,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said that as president, he would ``re-establish
linkage'' between U.S. trade privileges and such issues as China's
behavior toward Taiwan, China's work on long-range missiles that
could potentially threaten U.S. soil, and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants a war with China,'' Buchanan said. ``But I think
(the Clinton administration) with its embrace of China as a close,
strategic partner was naove in the extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also attempted to close the door on criticism of his
book ``A Republic, Not an Empire,'' in which he argued that German
dictator Adolf Hitler had no strategic interest in taking on the
United States in the early stages of World War II. Buchanan said
the United States had no vital interests at stake in Europe at that
time.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have accused Buchanan of insensitivity toward victims of
the Holocaust, of whom over half were Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Buchanan said the criticism was moot because
Holocaust historians said the mass extermination of Jews was not
planned by the Nazis until a 1942 conference outside Berlin. By
that time, the United States had entered the war in the wake of the
bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech at the Washington-based Center for Strategic
and International Studies, Buchanan said he was happy with his
decision to leave the Republican Party. He questioned the sincerity
of Bush and McCain on the abortion issue, saying he believed the
GOP was ``quietly abandoning the pro-life position.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain both oppose abortion and its legal foundation in
the 1973 Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade. However, unlike Bauer
and Buchanan, neither is willing to commit to appointing federal
judges who explicitly oppose abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said that while he shares ``some of Pat's critique'' of
the Republican Party, ``I do not share Pat's pessimism about the
chances of the Republican Party finding its voice again. So I
intend to stay in that fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said that if wins the GOP nomination, a Buchanan candidacy
on the Reform ticket would not draw votes away from the Republican
ticket. Without naming Bush directly, Bauer said he believed a
Buchanan could draw votes from the Republican line ``if the party
nominates (someone who) isn't serious about things like the
sanctity of life or a (President) Reagan- type of foreign policy
toward China.''

SOUNDS OF THE SEASON: WHICH CHRISTMAS CDS TO BUY, WHICH TO BANISH

<P>
   It's enough to turn anybody into a Scrooge _ having to face the
tall, unsteady pile of seasonal CDs we've accumulated for review in
the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody and their mom is putting their hand to ``Joy to the
World'' and ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'' and a dozen or so
endlessly recorded others _ whether their voices suit them or not.
</P>
<P>
   So our hearts were full of cheer and our stockings full of joy
when a wise editor said (read this aloud with deep, grandfatherly
voice): No, don't worry, just pick 12 for this story.
</P>
<P>
   Now this is a man who understands the spirit of giving, as in
giving us time to do other stuff, like graze whenever high-calorie
seasonal food is brought into the office (which these days is
almost every day) and shop with money we don't necessarily have.
'Tis the season, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Gladdened and mirthful, we divvied 'em up, listened to 'em, came
back and sat down in front of our computers, finding out that _ lo
and behold! _ 13 CDs had actually made our list.
</P>
<P>
   And hark! The deadline approaches!
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Garth Brooks, ``Garth Brooks &AMP; the Magic of Christmas,''
Capitol: Garth's second seasonal offering is in keeping with his
recent, poorly conceived foray into pop: Country is often
downplayed here, in favor of strings, horns and a choir on several
songs. Brooks often displays little feel for the material, and his
voice isn't always equal to the task at hand, two glaring examples
being ``It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year'' and ``Let It
Snow.'' The song selection is just the same-old-same-old, and this
CD should appeal to the staunchest of fans and few others.

   Jewel, ``Joy: A Holiday Collection,'' Atlantic: Um, no. Yodeling
Alaskan folk/rock iconess and bad poet Jewel should avoid seasonal
recordings at all costs, based on this 13-song effort. Simplicity
and directness have always served her well, but they're in short
supply here. The overdone string arrangements (Arif Mardin, you are
due a big chunk of coal) often bury her voice and take away from
what could have been a nice, small-scale, folksy effort. Moreover,
Jewel is just not suited to these songs: Listening to her try to
hit the high notes on ``O Holy Night'' is painful. Let's not do
this again, OK?

   Kenny G, ``Faith _ A Holiday Album,'' Arista: The G's spineless,
limp takes on seasonal favorites are, well, neither any better nor
any worse than any of his other material _ drab aural wallpaper,
faux jazz that is, inexplicably, wildly popular. So, then, will
this be _ but that doesn't mean ``you'' have to buy it, unless
you're going for the gag-gift angle for the Miles Davis fan in your
life. And, frankly, this is too expensive for a gag gift.

   George Strait, ``Merry Christmas Wherever You Are,'' MCA
Nashville: A new Christmas album by evergreen George is as welcome
as an old friend on the doorstep. It's been well over a decade
since he first addressed the holidays with ``Merry Christmas Strait
to You.'' That album was a western-swing romp through the holidays,
but ``Merry'' is a more mainstream collection. Don't be frightened
by the overdone standards here: ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer''
and ``Jingle Bell Rock'' get upbeat, jazzy treatments from George.
And his teasing turn on ``All I Want for Christmas (Is My Two Front
Teeth)'' is cute, too. The new material is worthy of more than one
Christmas on the CD player, especially ``Noel Leon,'' a
down-to-earth, conversational tale that will warm hearts all around
with its gentle word play. ``Old Time Christmas'' is bittersweet,
and the title cut of lost love is even sadder. It's a good thing
``I Know What I Want for Christmas'' is playful.

   Ringo Starr, ``I Wanna Be Santa Claus,'' Mercury: Now this is a
Christmas record. Redolent of the late-night recording session and
the wild off-site office party, ``Santa Claus'' is Ringo's first
Christmas record, and it's chock-full of joyous takes on ``The
Little Drummer Boy'' and ``Rudolph,'' PLUS he's written several
originals _ check the Gary Glitter-ish stomp of the opener, ``Come
on Christmas, Christmas Come On.'' There's also, yo ho ho, a take
on an obscure Beatles song, ``Christmas Time Is Here Again,'' with
Aerosmith's Joe Perry chipping in a guitar solo. Rock fans looking
to update their cache of seasonal CDs can stop right here.

   Dan Fogelberg, ``The First Christmas Morning,'' Morning Sky:
Another debut Christmas recording, another resounding success.
Fogelberg's foray into seasonal music has a distinct
olde-tyme/medieval air to it and boasts several pretty original
instrumentals, the most luminous being ``Winterskol'' and ``Feast
of Fools.'' The song selection is also consistently rewarding, with
the English lullaby carol ``This Endris Night'' and ``In the Bleak
Mid-Winter'' getting rare airings. Put this on, light a fire,
cuddle up with your sweetie, and enjoy.

   Jimi Hendrix, ``Merry Christmas and Happy New Year,'' Experience
Hendrix: Yes, this is correct _ Jimi does Christmas. Or did,
anyway, 30 years ago this month: Seems that in December 1969 the
Voodoo Chile (with bassist Billy Cox and drummer and current Fort
Worth resident Buddy Miles) taped a medley of ``Little Drummer Boy,
Silent Night'' and ``Auld Lang Syne'' while rehearsing for his
famous New Year's Eve shows at the Fillmore East. The result is
rough, drenched in feedback _ and ultimately well worth a listen or
four. The second, seven-minute take of the same medley (apparently
taped the same day) is even better, with more exploratory guitar.
Also included is the sweet, and actually quite, um, groovy ``Three
Little Bears,'' a Jimi-does-a-children's-tale from May 1968. All in
all, this is an odd, brief little gem that's perfect for the
classic-rock fan on your list.

   Andrae Crouch, ``The Gift of Christmas,'' Qwest Records: This
offering from the Los Angeles-based gospel star is a definite
keeper. Crouch joins with Chaka Khan, Yolanda Adams, Patti Austin,
Kirk Whalum and others to deliver a richly satisfying collection of
favorites and new originals, all hinging on his deft arrangements
and ability to fuse gospel, classical and R&AMP;B. The familiar songs,
such as ``It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,'' are reworked and
invigorated, and the originals, such as ``This Christmas''
(featuring La Chaka) are also well worth hearing.

   Reba McEntire, ``Secret of Giving: A Christmas Collection,'' MCA
Nashville: Christmas concepts that tie into TV specials seem so
contrived (see ``Garth Brooks &AMP; the Magic of Christmas),'' and Reba
joins the crowd here with an album spawned by her network movie
last week, ``Secret of Giving.'' The title cut is nice enough, as
is the Tony Arata-penned ``This Is My Prayer for You.'' The bulk of
the rest is the most pedestrian of holiday fare: ``I Saw Mommy
Kissing Santa Claus'' and ``Up on the Housetop.'' Two
country-at-heart songs really save the day, however. ``The Angels
Sang'' is a working-mom story that will have commuters pulling over
on the freeway to dab at their eyes, and ``Santa Claus Is Coming
Back to Town'' is, well, less than blissful.

   98 Degrees, ``This Christmas,'' Universal: Yet another boy band,

little from the one released a year ago by teeny-bop-pop cohorts 'N
Sync: A couple of originals mixed in with predictable traditionals
sung with the syrup turned on, the emotion turned off. Next year
it'll be some other cute-guy-group's turn and 98 Degrees will have
considerably cooled.

   Amy Grant, ``A Christmas to Remember,'' Myrrh Records: On her
latest Christmas disc, Amy Grant ... enlists the help of Sonic
Youth guitarist Thurston Moore and plays a feedback-drenched,
13-minute version of ``Silent Night?'' Does a punk-rock version of
``Jingle-Bell Rock?'' Gets Puff Daddy to produce? Not quite, but
the Grammy/Dove-winning pop singer's third Christmas CD does go
beyond the norm _ with mixed results. A symphony provides most of
the music, giving ``Remember'' a somewhat one-dimensional
heavy-handedness; the over-the-top arrangements also frequently
overpower Grant's voice. On the upshot, Grant's selection of
material is interesting: There's plenty of new stuff, a coupla
faves and, this is the weird thing, two nice instrumentals,
including the mournful, bagpipe-driven ``Highland Cathedral.'' Sure
beats ``Let It Snow.''

   Martina McBride, ``White Christmas,'' RCA: Perhaps trying to

Everything here is either slow and sappy or goes way overboard,
like a Celine Dion commercial. McBride's got a rugged, wide-ranging
voice; too bad she wasted it on bland, Sears-intercom glop like
this. Martina, please come back!

Star (This Christmas Night)'' is ethereal in that high, Bryan White
way. But we can get nice covers of ``I'll Be Home for Christmas''
from so many other sources.

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Washington) _ After two days of opening talks,
Israel and Syria agreed Thursday to resume negotiations toward

   RWANDA-REPORT (United Nations) _ A strongly worded report issued
Thursday by an international panel of experts holds both U.N.
officials and leading member countries, primarily the United
States, responsible for failing to stop the genocide in Rwanda. The
report says that about 800,000 people were killed in 100 days
between April and July 1994, and it portrays an organization weak

months that preceded the attacks. By Barbara Crossette. (1200

   NY-DIALLO-TRIAL (New York) _ An appellate court ruled Thursday

fair trial in the Bronx. By Amy Waldman.
</P>
<P>
   BROOKLYN-ART-ATTACK (New York) _ A man was arrested Thursday at
the Brooklyn Museum of Art after he threw white latex paint on the

   AIDS-MINORITIES (New York) _ A hugely disproportionate number of
minorities represent new AIDS cases, yet blacks and Latinos have
not had front and center positions in AIDS policy making.
Mainstream black groups have shied away from the issue, and
minority groups devoted to it have had trouble getting money. But
slowly, that is all changing, as more minorities find themselves in
powerful positions in the advocacy and policy front, and state and
federal dollars are starting to be newly appropriated in
recognition of where the disease now hits home. By Jennifer
Steinhauer. (1600 words)

NEW YORK CRITICS HONOR LEIGH'S `TOPSY-TURVY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The British director Mike Leigh won twin accolades
Thursday when the New York Film Critics Circle voted
``Topsy-Turvy,'' his pageantry-laden tribute to the operetta duo
Gilbert and Sullivan, the best film of 1999. Leigh also won as best
director.
</P>
<P>
   David Lynch was runner-up in the directing category for ``The
Straight Story.'' That film stars Richard Farnsworth, the circle's
choice for best actor, as an old man who drives a lawnmower halfway
across Iowa to visit his ailing brother.
</P>
<P>
   The film earned Freddie Francis the vote for best cinematography
in a very tight race against ``Sleepy Hollow,'' Tim Burton's grim
adaptation of the Washington Irving tale, filmed by Emmanuel
Lubezki.
</P>
<P>
   The Midwest was also the setting for the role that earned Hilary
Swank the award for best actress, for ``Boys Don't Cry,'' in which
she plays a young woman who is killed after she was discovered to
be impersonating a man. Directed by Kimberly Peirce, ``Boys Don't
Cry'' was edged out by Spike Jonze's ``Being John Malkovich'' for
best first film.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Plummer, who played the television journalist Mike
Wallace in ``The Insider,'' Michael Mann's film about a
whistle-blower in the tobacco industry, went neck and neck for best
supporting actor with John Malkovich, who ultimately won for
playing a version of himself in Jonze's feature debut. Best
supporting actress went to Catherine Keener for ``Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time the circle voted for a best animated film.
The award went to ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' a
spinoff from the popular Comedy Central series.
</P>
<P>
   Best screenplay honors went to Jim Taylor and Alexander Payne
for ``Election,'' their acerbic satire of the American electoral
process, starring Reese Witherspoon as a tough cookie running for
senior class president.
</P>
<P>
   Wim Wender's ``Buena Vista Social Club,'' about a reunion of
veteran Cuban musicians, earned the award for best documentary,
barely nudging out Errol Morris' ``Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of
Fred A. Leuchter Jr.,'' a bleak take on a man who builds execution
devices.
</P>
<P>
   The best foreign film award went to Pedro Almodovar's ``All
About My Mother,'' a gender-bending tribute to ``All About Eve''
and ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' and to ``actresses who play
actresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Manny Farber won a special award for his distinguished
contribution to film criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The annual vote, the group's 65th, took place at the Algonquin
Hotel in Manhattan. The awards will be presented at Windows on the
World on Jan. 10. The group's chairman is Owen Gleiberman of
Entertainment Weekly.

BORGNINE SCRIPTS DONATED TO UNIVERSITY OF NORTH ALABAMA

<P>
   FLORENCE, Ala. _ Academy Award winner Ernest Borgnine is
donating a collection of his personal movie scripts to the
University of North Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's giving us leather-bound copies of more than 100 of his
personal movie scripts from throughout his career,'' said fellow
actor George Lindsey, a UNA graduate and Borgnine's longtime
friend.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to presenting his script collection to the library,
Borgnine will be UNA's mid-year commencement speaker Saturday. The
star of ``Marty,'' ``McHale's Navy'' and ``The Wild Bunch'' will
address 380 UNA graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the colleges and universities in this country, we have
the Ernest Borgnine scripts,'' said Lindsey, best known for his
role of Goober on ``The Andy Griffith Show.'' ``I think that makes
us special.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey has established a collection of television and films
scripts at UNA's Collier Library, which includes his own scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Borgnine visited Florence last April, when he was the featured
artist for UNA's second annual George Lindsey Television and Film
Festival. Near the conclusion of that festival, Borgnine announced
his decision to donate his scripts to Lindsey's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ``These scripts he's donating include all of his personal notes
and stage directions, and they'll be available for study forever
and forever,'' Lindsey said. ``People will have a chance to study
exactly how Ernie approached each part he played and what all went
into each of his performances.''
</P>
<P>
   The 82-year-old actor is best-known for his tough-guy roles in
``From Here to Eternity,'' ``Bad Day at Black Rock,'' ``The
Vikings'' and ``The Dirty Dozen.'' He earned the best-actor Oscar
in 1955, playing a lovelorn Bronx butcher in the gentle drama
``Marty.''
</P>
<P>
   On television, Borgnine starred as a harried, soft-hearted Navy
commander in the comedy favorite ``McHale's Navy'' (1962-66). In
recent years, he's been active on television in ``Airwolf'' and
``The Single Guy,'' and on the big screen in ``Gattaca,''
``BASE-ketball,'' ``Small Soldiers'' and the movie remake of
``McHale's Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   Borgnine, who lives in California, will be the subject of an A&AMP;E
``Biography'' episode Jan. 24.

 &HT;    McCain, Bradley take the pledge on soft money
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, N.H. _ In a rare bipartisan appearance, Democrat Bill
Bradley and Republican John McCain pledged Thursday to ban their
parties from accepting unregulated soft money if they become the
presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and McCain delivered their pledge before 50 New
Hampshire voters in a town hall meeting staged by ABC News's
``Nightline,'' which rebroadcast the event to a national audience
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The two men came to this small town nestled in the mountains on
the western edge of New Hampshire because it was the site of a
handshake between President Clinton and then-House Speaker Newt
Gingrich of Georgia. In June 1995, Clinton and Gingrich pledged to
establish a commission to enact campaign finance reform. The
commission never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's joint appearance was the first time candidates in
opposing parties had appeared together since 1980, when Sen. Edward
Kennedy of Massachusetts, running against President Carter,
appeared with Rep. John Anderson, a Republican running as an
independent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley used Thursday's forum as an opportunity to
lay out their platform for campaign finance reform to undercut
their front-running rivals. And each had harsh words for the
front-runner in the other's primary contest.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the big scandal of the Clinton-Gore administration
was not Monica Lewinsky but the campaign finance excesses of the
1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   McCain singled out a fund-raising trip the vice president made
to a Buddhist monastery in California during which monks, sworn to
lives of poverty, contributed thousands of dollars to the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain mocked Vice President Al Gore's response to questions
about fund-raising calls made from the White House, when the vice
president insisted there was ``no controlling'' legal authority
governing his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm president, there will be a controlling legal
authority,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also took aim at Republican front-runner George W. Bush,
accusing the Texas governor of ``thumbing his nose'' at the
campaign finance system by refusing to abide by spending limits and
accept federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has flaunted ... the public finance laws,'' Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Bush said he supported a ban on soft
money but that the proposals advanced by Bradley and McCain would
hurt the ``Republican Party and our conservative principles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any plan to reduce the influence of special interest money in
politics must be fair _ and no plan should benefit one political
party over another,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore placed a full-page advertisement in the local paper
Thursday saying he would ban soft money if the Republican nominee
also agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Although both Bradley and McCain pledged to ban soft money if
they are the nominees, only McCain made his pledge unconditional.
McCain said he would not accept soft money regardless of who the
Democratic nominee is, while Bradley reserved the right to make
that decision later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We confront different circumstances,'' Bradley said. ``If John
McCain is the nominee and I am the nominee, there will be no soft
money for presidential campaigns. But if it is the governor of
Texas on the Republican side, I then have to deal with somebody who
I think will demonstrate that you can have too much money in
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men also called for broadcast television networks to
provide free television time to presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   They differed, however, on the issue of public financing of
presidential and congressional campaigns. Bradley called for full
public financing of general election campaigns, which he said would
cost $900 million.

<P>
   MINSK, Belarus _ In the last 32 months, Anatoly Lebedko has been
tried on criminal charges five times, fined four times, imprisoned
twice and seriously beaten once, on the front steps of his
apartment. His office telephone is tapped. His friends are hectored
by the tax police.
</P>
<P>
   The state security police recently ordered his neighbor's
10-year-old son to spy on him, and he recently returned from a trip
to find two subpoenas in his mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the democratic opposition in Belarus is no easy job.
Then again, it could be worse: in September, Lebedko's predecessor
as opposition leader, Viktor Gonchar, went to his local steam bath,
dutifully trailed by his security police collars, and has yet to
come back.
</P>
<P>
   Never exactly a beacon of freedom, Belarus these days is
increasingly the scene of strange and terrible happenings. Lebedko
is persecuted; Gonchar is presumed to be dead.
</P>
<P>
   Gonchar's own predecessor fled to Lithuania in July, fearing for
his life. A fourth opposition leader died in April, ostensibly from
a brain hemorrhage, at age 49. Two top government officials who
turned against Belarus' leadership disappeared in April and May.
</P>
<P>
   Disappearances and death threats are new elements in political
repression in post-Soviet Belarus. They have further winnowed an
already small democracy movement and sent a chill through what
opposition remains.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, they may have forever remade the image of the
country's leader, Aleksander Lukashenko, long regarded as just a
goofy autocrat. Stories abound of his obsession with sports, his
off-color speeches and other quirky behavior, but now he is quickly
earning a reputation as a ruthless dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgeable foreign analysts say there is no proof that
Lukashenko's government is liquidating opponents. There are
suggestions that in some cases independent death squads or splinter
groups in the nation's large security apparatus may have taken
matters into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no denying that Lukashenko, who became president in
1994 in the country's first free election, has done little to halt
the crimes, or that he has used them to sow disarray among his
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening here in this small country is underestimated
by the U.S.,'' Lebedko said the other day in his office not far
from downtown Minsk. ``This regime is supported by elementary fear.
This is the legacy of the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Some independent groups say the situation in Belarus has
worsened sharply since last winter, when critics began organizing
surprisingly vigorous protests against Lukashenko's rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government crackdown on independent media, civil society
and political activity has become more systematic and violent,''
said a report issued in April by the East-West Institute, a New
York-based organization promoting democracy in former Soviet-bloc
nations. ``The public mood in Belarus is characterized by an
insidious and deepening fear as well as the widespread belief that
little can be done to change the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The deterioration goes well beyond the disappearances _ of
Gonchar; of Anatoly Krasovsky, a financial backer of government
critics; Yuri Zakharenko, a former interior minister who was
politically organizing police officers when he disappeared; and
Tamara Vinnikova, a former head of the central bank who was under
house arrest when she vanished.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 13, a Belarussian newspaper published what it said was a
statement it had received by telephone from Ms. Vinnikova from an
unidentified country,Reuters reported. She said the Belarussian
authorities had plotted to kill her, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Sannikov, leader of the human rights group Charter 97,
was beaten in February. He later fled to Geneva after a security
police officer delivered a death threat via a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Seymon Sharetsky was speaker of the democratically elected
Parliament that Lukashenko dissolved after a 1996 constitutional
referendum that greatly expanded presidential powers and was widely
judged to be rigged. He fled to Lithuania in July.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Chigir, the prime minister until he resigned in protest
over the referendum, was arrested in March, one day after he
registered to run in a shadow presidential election. He was
released in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Klimov, a member of the disbanded Parliament who signed a
demand for Lukashenko's impeachment, has been in jail since
February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Others suffer without ever seeing the inside of a cell.
</P>
<P>
   Zinaida Gonchar has stopped working since her husband
disappeared. Now she sits in the family's apartment, not really
waiting for news, she says, because even investigators told her
that the truth was probably locked in a secret police file.
</P>
<P>
   Belarussian politics is a closed society, and the Gonchars knew
Lukashenko well _ so well that he often came to their home for
dinner; so well that Gonchar served as deputy prime minister in
Lukashenko's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gonchar said the friendship began to crack in 1994, when
Gonchar remained neutral rather than help Lukashenko campaign for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, Viktor Gonchar was driving the family car when
``he had an accident _ the wheel just came off,'' his wife said.
``He was pretty badly injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko nevertheless recruited Gonchar into the government.
But Gonchar quit after two months and got a job elsewhere. He was
elected to Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the telephone began ringing, with threats and warnings,
mostly against me,'' his wife said. ``They'd say, `We'll come
upstairs and beat you.' Or I'd be walking on the sidewalk and a car
would suddenly jump on the sidewalk in front of me and back out.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Someone shot at Viktor Gonchar's car one day, wounding his
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko organized the 1996 constitutional referendum, and
Gonchar became chairman of the government's election watchdog
commission. Then Lukashenko dismissed him and Gonchar became a
member of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Gonchar and other former legislators published a
brochure on constitutional violations by the government. The
security police searched the Gonchar apartment and took him in for
questioning. He took a breather after that, working on a
Belarus-Lithuania tribunal, and the harassment eased.
</P>
<P>
   But in late 1998, democracy advocates decided to hold a shadow
presidential election marking what would have been expiration date
of Lukashenko's term in office had the term not been lengthened by
two years in the referendum. Gonchar was named to run the electoral
commission.
</P>
<P>
   And the troubles resumed. In March the police imprisoned
Gonchar. He went on a hunger strike. After 10 days, he was released
from jail and thrown on a snowbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last six months, we were followed constantly _ not only
Viktor, but myself,'' Mrs. Gonchar said. ``We were warned on
several occasions.'' She said the security police were tailing
Gonchar the night he and Krasovsky took their weekly trip to the
baths. ``So I have no doubt,'' she said, ``that the authorities
know exactly who is responsible for this kidnapping.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko pooh-poohs the disappearance, saying Gonchar is
rumored to be in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The president's seemingly casual attitude toward his opponents'
troubles has come at a price. At the recent summit meeting of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Lukashenko was
ostracized by Western leaders.
</P>
<P>
   An inventive man, though, he found a way around that.
</P>
<P>
   As leaders strolled to a meal one day, Lukashenko ambushed
President Clinton long enough to assert later that they had had a
weighty discussion and that he had even invited Clinton to visit
Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him a joke,'' Lukashenko recalled later. ``If you
cannot'' visit Belarus ``before the end of your term, then all you
will have to do is extend it.''

&HT;     STUDY SHOWS PARENTS OUT OF TOUCH WITH TEEN DRINKING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only 3 percent of parents believe their
high-school-aged children have slugged as many as five alcoholic
drinks in a row over the past month, according to a new survey,
although federal statistics have shown that a third of 9th through
12th graders have done so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are not aware and certainly not in touch with what is
happening with their kids and alcohol,'' said pollster Peter D.
Hart, who announced his findings Thursday at a news conference
here.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were part of an extensive nationwide telephone
survey by his polling firm in which he interviewed 574 parents of
10- to 17-year-olds, including 296 parents of high school students.
The margin of error is 4.2 percentage points among the 574 parents
and 5.8 percentage points among the 296.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were part of a report entitled ``Millennium
Hangover: Keeping Score on Alcohol,'' released by Drug Strategies,
a nonprofit Washington research institute funded by philanthropic
groups including the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which has
played a leading role in the fight to keep tobacco away from
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that a quarter of the parents of high
school students said they would allow their children to go to a
millennium party where they suspected alcohol would be served.
</P>
<P>
   But Hart warned, ``The best way to have a good millennium is to
open your ears and open your eyes to what your children are doing.
They're doing a lot more than you think.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug Strategies President Mathea Falco said teen drinking has
dramatically increased over the last five years, and that many
youngsters are now talking about drinking to get drunk instead of
going out for a drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``More kids are binge drinking,'' Falco said during the news
conference. ``This is such a national social problem.'' The
solution, she added, lies in ``a massive attitudinal change.''
</P>
<P>
   It would require enforcement of current underage drinking laws,
clamping down on fake identification used by underage youths,
fighting illegal sales of alcohol to minors through the Internet
and launching a massive advertising campaign to change youngsters'
attitudes about heavy drinking, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
found that 33 percent of 9th through 12th graders said they had
consumed five or more drinks in one sitting in the past 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Drug Strategies estimated that the cost of underage drinking is
more than $58 billion a year, including costs from traffic
accidents, violent crime, suicide attempts and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Its report said children who begin drinking at early ages are at
much greater risk for alcoholism later in life. Youngsters who
drink before age 15 are four times more likely to develop alcohol
dependence than those who start drinking after age 21, according to
the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a research
arm of the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said after the news conference that advertising campaigns
launched in recent years by Mothers Against Drunk Driving have
helped to make drinking and driving socially unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My point is that binge drinking can also become uncool,'' Hart
said.

COLUMN: PUBLIC MISINFORMED ON GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider the possibilities of a scientific breakthrough that
could allow farmers to grow more food while using less pesticide,
or to produce cholesterol-free soybeans, or to add vitamins to
vegetable oils to prevent malnutrition. Maybe it could let some
plastic products now made from oil instead be produced from plants.
</P>
<P>
   Would the stock prices of companies developing such products
soar to Internet-style heights? Would the scientists be viewed as
potential saviors in a world where hunger and malnutrition are
realities for many millions, and where pollution from oil
refineries remains a problem?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to both questions is ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom in human history has a technology with such exciting
possibilities seemed less popular than genetic modification of
foods _ a k a ``Frankenstein foods'' in the British tabloids _ is
today. Wall Street is leery, and now class-action lawyers have
leaped in with a double-barreled suit accusing Monsanto, the
leading company in the field, of trying to monopolize a business
the lawyers say relies on foisting possibly dangerous foods on the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The way things are going, Monsanto executives who want to avoid
being harassed at cocktail parties and on airlines may take to
lying about what they do. Perhaps they'd do better if they claimed
to be from Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   How did we get to this point? One answer is that the industry's
lobbyists were too successful. They persuaded the Food and Drug
Administration that genetic modification _ which involves inserting
a gene into a plant _ was not very different from the old way of
breeding plants, and the corn or soybeans were equally nutritious.
So there was no need to call attention to it on labels.
</P>
<P>
   But because there was no need to reassure consumers, there was
also no need to educate them. The marketing efforts focused on
farmers and, as it happened, the early products did more for
farmers, with higher crop yields and resistance to pests, than for
consumers, in terms of improved nutrition. Farmers embraced the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Then the resistance arose, largely in Europe. Who can be
absolutely certain that these products will not have some bad
effect on animals, or plants, or the environment? Ask the question
that way, and the answer is that no one can. Ask whether the
evidently small risks offset the potential gains _ in nutrition and
in reducing pesticide use, among others _ and you might get a
different answer.
</P>
<P>
   Now European fears are being exported to an American public that
knows virtually nothing about the subject _ and is hearing about it
from people warning of dangers. Farmers are getting nervous about
planting the seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wall Street is putting pressure on Monsanto to spin
off its Searle pharmaceuticals business. James Wilbur, an analyst
at Salomon Smith Barney, figures that an independent Searle would
be worth about $38 a share. You can buy Searle, with the rest of
Monsanto thrown in, for less than $41 a share, which gives you some
idea just how happy investors are about agribusiness these days.
Since the end of 1997, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 is up 46 percent,
while Monsanto is down 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been better if Monsanto and its competitors had
insisted on _ rather than resisted _ putting labels on genetically
modified products. Perhaps they could have portrayed the labels as
indicating a superior product with environmental benefits. Instead,
they left the public education to the industry's foes. In
persuading regulators that no labels were needed, the lobbyists won
a pyrrhic victory.

COLTS ON THE FAST TRACK TO SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing; moved Dec. 10.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS -- The day in America's heartland is cool, December
dank, and dark. The Colts are leaving the field after a midweek
practice and the members of the media are seated under a giant old
tree, sturdy as the Midwest. Jim Mora walks over and begins talking
about a phenomenon rarely seen in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Time spinning faster than it does on the coasts.
</P>
<P>
   A new rage exploding first in Indiana and only then fanning
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts stomping.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Mora is tanned. There is a glint to his eye. His smile is quick.
That image from New Orleans when he fell apart at a news conference
after his Saints lost their sixth game in eight and Mora resigned
after 11 seasons with the team seems long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Mora is asked by an outsider when he realized his Colts were not
just a team on the upswing, but one of the best in the National
Football League. ``To be honest, I hadn't been asked that question
before,'' he said. ``I don't know if I can say there was any one
moment.'' It's happening so fast. The Colts now have an offense
that draws in neutral fans for a look at how football should be
played. The Colts now have a quarterback, Peyton Manning, and a
running back, Edgerrin James, and a wide receiver, Marvin Harrison,
that seem to have the potential of being more exciting than any of
the last generation.
</P>
<P>
   And it happened so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know in this business,'' said Mora. ``I've been in
this business long enough to know that crazy things happen. No, I
didn't think we'd win this many games.'' Mora exhaled a deep
breath. ``You saw this potential in this team, especially
offensively, and yet you never know what's going to happen next
year. You know you're an injury away, a key injury away, from going
the other way.'' So fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice that it's happening,'' said Mora, struggling to put
into words this sudden rise from the ashes of the Colts - and
himself. ``It gives you a nice feeling . . . it's better than not
having it.'' Two games with the Patriots, both in Foxborough, stand
out as benchmarks on the trek upward. The first, early in the 1998
season, was perhaps Manning's worst in his short career, the rookie
quarterback looking confused, lost, bewildered, and inept, throwing
interception after interception. ``That was maybe Peyton's worst
game,'' said Mora, as the Colts struggled to a 3-13 year.
</P>
<P>
   But Manning was not scarred as so many rookie quarterbacks are
by sudden ineptitude when they take that giant step to professional
football. (''That Patriots game was tough,'' said Manning. ``I was
worried that I might be scarred.'') Late last season, said Mora,
``he made it over the hump'' when he went out to San Francisco and
fired three touchdown passes in a 34-31 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The next benchmark, early this season, came when the Colts
scored 28 points in the first half against New England as Manning
checked off at the line of scrimmage on play after play, testing Ty
Law as no other quarterback had tested him, throwing three TD
passes to Harrison over Law. ``That showed how much I'd learned
about defenses since that other game in Foxborough,'' Manning said
of the many audibles.
</P>
<P>
   But the Colts blew that lead, as Mora's teams in New Orleans,
good as they were, so often blew leads and lost games they should
have won. Those experiences often led Mora to go conservative with
a lead, but a hard, hard lesson was learned in Foxborough by these
young Colts. They learned their offense was too good to ever be set
in neutral, that their offense could suck all momentum from
opposing teams.
</P>
<P>
   Mora also learned that he had a quarterback ``who was a
competitor, one who could handle pressure, one who - like a Larry
Bird or Michael Jordan - wants the ball in pressure, critical
situations, one who handles adversity and doesn't let it put him in
the tank.'' Mora has ever been known as a defensive coach, deep in
his core the football truism that defenses win games. But now, as
the Colts' defense is still being built, Mora has a true offensive
power, one that can win games with its sheer explosiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive guru (''Oh, nobody is a guru in this business,''
he countered) was asked to look at his offense from a defensive
coach's eyes. Mora complied, but the essential defensive nature of
his soul told him that no offense, not even the Colts', is unstopp
able. ``Nobody is unstoppable,'' said Mora. ``We fought for our
lives twice against the Jets. We fought for our lives . . . I mean,
we scored 16 points in one game and 13 in the other. Nobody is
unstoppable. I guarantee that. I coached against the 49ers every
year for many years when they had a great offensive machine and
there were times they had trouble scoring points.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody struggles.'' And Mora knows so well the cycle of NFL
football. A team can spring suddenly upon the scene, but as that
team enjoys more and more success, opposing coaches devote more of
their attention, and their schemes, to stopping it. It is the way
of life in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when you are doing good in this business, when you
really are doing good on offense, then everybody is really bearing
down to put the clamps on you to stop that offense,'' said Mora.
``It makes it even tougher.'' There is one element to this Colts
team that makes it so different from Mora's New Orleans teams.
Beyond the quarterback, beyond the running back, beyond the wide
receiver, there is Tom Moore. He is 60, has spent 22 years coaching
in the NFL, and, for most of the years, has been the coordinator
for some very good offenses.
</P>
<P>
   From the Steelers of Terry Bradshaw and Lynn Swann in the late
1970s to the Lions of Barry Sanders in the 1990s, the offense that
led the league and was the first to have two receivers (Herman
Moore and Brett Perriman) with more than 1,000 yards receiving,
Moore has been excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, Tom Moore more or less called the plays,'' said
Manning. ``As he's gained confidence in me and as I have a better
understanding of what we're doing, it's gotten better. Last year,
I'd just listen to the play. But now I have a pretty good idea of
what he's going to call before he calls it and that's what you want
to have between a quarterback and a coordinator.'' Now, the bond is
total between the wise and savvy Moore and Manning. They think the
same - they think the worst epithet for an offensive game plan
after the last play ``is to be one play away,'' as Manning put it.
``The worst thing is to think, `I just wish we had the post call
when they were in that defense.' `` (For Patriot fans who no longer
remember what a post pattern or quick slant pass play entails, the
receiver cuts diagonally to the inside. Despite the Patriots'
reluctance to use the patterns, they still are most effective
against some blitzes.) ``We want to use that last play,'' Manning
said. ``If they're showing blitz, hey . . . we want the post route
and we know we can get to it. That's kind of a result of how much
confidence I have in Tom and Tom has in me. We never want to leave
the field thinking of that one last play we should have called but
we didn't call.'' These Colts of Mora, unlike those Saints of Mora
who just couldn't take the final step, do not think offense is
merely what happens when the defense is not on the field. Blowing
that 28-7 lead to the Patriots taught them all a lesson - keep
scoring points.
</P>
<P>
   So fast.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts are among the NFL's best. Unlike last year's Falcons,
who also made a sudden rise, it is clear this team will be very
good for several years.
</P>
<P>
   And if it happened so fast that Mora doesn't realize exactly
when the Colts went from a team on the uptick to a team that must
be feared, his decades in pro football have taught him one lesson:
Seize the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take advantage of the opportunity when you've
got it,'' Mora said. ``All coaches learn that. It's really
important. You've got to . . .
</P>
<P>
   you've got to . . . you never know when it's going to come
again.''

BORDEAUX TO TASTE WINES FOR QUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bordeaux wines that fail to meet new retail tasting standards
face the threat of being banned from sale as the French wine
industry attempts to counteract increasing competition from the
United States, Australia, Argentina and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The standards, called ``downstream control,'' take effect in
global markets beginning in January. The system is now being tested
in France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are the most famous in the world you receive a lot of
criticism,'' said Eric Dulong, vice president of the Bordeaux wine
bureau and a negociant, the term for a wine wholesaler/exporter.
``If we want to keep our reputation we have to stay the best. This
program is important proof that Bordeaux wants to maintain the
standard of quality for the wine regions of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The new system allows the Bordeaux wine bureau, the Conseil
Interprofessionnel du vin de Bordeaux, to buy 200 samples in any
market _ from retail shelves, distributors or restaurants _ and
subject the lot to a blind tasting by Bordeaux wine experts. Wines
will be graded from A to D. ``D'' is what Dulong said is
``unacceptable for Bordeaux.''
</P>
<P>
   The wines of a producer or negociant with a D rating would be
subject to a comprehensive tasting of all tanks of wine or all
bottles in a negociant's warehouse, not just the wine that fails
the taste test. If the wines do not meet a range of quality
standards, remedial controls will be put into effect.
</P>
<P>
   If, at a second tasting, the wines fail, they will not be
allowed to be sold. The process could take a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeaux has more than 12,000 producers and 400 negociants
selling more than 170 million gallons of wine worth $1.37 billion a
year, according to 1998 figures. Export sales have slowed in 1999
due to factors including less demand from Asia, skyrocketing prices
for top Bordeaux wines and the gap in quality from one Bordeaux
wine to the next.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important reason, said Dulong and Bordeaux
importers, is the New World competition in the lower price ranges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are conscious the competition is very, very strong and that
many other countries are producing fantastic wines today,'' Dulong
said. ``Our wines are not drinkable too young, they are not
mono-varietal. Our aim is to keep our identity and produce
excellent wines.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have come to expect good quality, from the bottom rung
to the top, in Bordeaux wines. But consumers, particularly those
new to wine, are weaned on early-and-easy drinking varietal wines
of the New World and might find Bordeaux hard to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who are buying wine ``blind'' in the $6 to $12 range
are safer buying wines from other parts of the world, said Alun
Griffiths, a Master of Wine and wine director for Berry Brothers
and Rudd, one of the largest UK importers of Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very little confidence in that end of the Bordeaux
market. The wines _ from cooperatives and syndicates _ haven't been
quality-driven; the wines have been resting on their laurels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bordeaux wines have gone up so much in price that it is hard
to drink these wines every night,'' said Jeff Zacharia of Zachys,
among New York's benchmark wine retailers. ``Below $20 there's a
crisis in confidence. The issue is price; nobody's going up in
price like Bordeaux, and it is hard to find good quality Bordeaux
to fill in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The French test program began in September. It piggy-backs on
annual appellation tastings that award a winery the right to call
its wines ``Bordeaux.'' Some 98 percent of all wines made in
Bordeaux pass that test.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be lower, maybe 85 to 90 percent,'' Dulong said.
</P>
<P>
   The first test grades under the new system will be out in a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When the program expands in January, it will center primarily on
Europe; two of every three bottles of exported Bordeaux wines are
sold within the European Union. It will also be used in the United
States and Japan, Dulong said, beginning in the second half of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Dulong, who is also vice president of the Bordeaux negociant's
association, acknowledged that the program is in response to
criticism such as that of Griffiths and Zacharia, as well as
scathing reports and sour tasting results in the British wine
press.
</P>
<P>
   ``As negociants we travel in other countries, we see the
competition every day, we hear the criticism,'' Dulong said.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffiths and others say the proof is to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applaud it in principal, but I have reservations about
whether it has real teeth,'' he said. ``If it works and quality
improves, it will make my job easier to sell Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   As the Bordeaux buyer for Zachys, Zacharia said he would welcome
quality control in the United States. ``If the quality of the
lower-end Bordeaux goes up, we could fill more shelves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeaux has less space on retail shelves and many people are
drinking California and Italian wines instead. In general, wine
sales are up, but not Bordeaux, Zacharia said .

JAN. 3 COULD BE FIRST TRUE TEST OF Y2K READINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With only 16 days remaining before Jan. 1, 2000, the
conventional wisdom about the pending impact of the Y2K software
bug goes something like this: Party first, fret later.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the message from consumers, who don't seem to be
stocking up on bottled water and canned goods. Not so with
champagne. ``It's a very good year,'' said Gino Pignone, general
manager at Blanchard's Liquors Inc. in Boston, which reports strong
sales of the beverage lately.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's celebrants should have plenty of company, because a
consensus among local utility and bank executives, software
consultants, and federal planners holds that few major disruptions
will strike on New Year's Day in New England and the rest of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest tests may come as business and stock markets
reopen Monday, Jan. 3. Then, minor problems are expected to crop up
at thousands of smaller companies, schools, and other
organizations, ranging from payroll disruptions to manufacturing
problems and lost grades. The cumulative impact of these problems
is hard to forecast but could be significant. Also, the picture is
more confused overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to be confident that the basic infrastructure of
the US is going to function,'' said John Koskinen, President
Clinton's chief Y2K adviser, in a recent interview. ``Our concern,
from a global perspective, is that a series of otherwise manageable
problems might tax the systems as they cut across economic
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Most organizations ``will experience only limited damage from
the Y2K bug,'' according to a report issued Monday in Washington by
a United Nations Y2K center. ``The combination of a great deal of
dedicated effort, the limited use of digital controls in most
infrastructures, and society's general resilience mean that,
although there will be many Y2K-caused errors, the combined
negative effect of these errors will be moderate,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasting the impact of Y2K has become a cottage industry
among computer specialists and public officials trying to minimize
the impact of the software flaw. The problem stems from the
convention among many older software programs to represent the year
with only two digits. Left unfixed, the condition could lead to
disruptions everywhere from cash machines to power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have spent billions of dollars on software repairs as
a result and, since the end of June, institutions including New
England's major water and power utilities and banks have said they
met upgrade deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   The progress among smaller companies is much more difficult to
gauge, however. A survey released last week by the National
Federation of Independent Business, which represents firms with
fewer than 100 employees, showed 26 percent have no plans to check
their computers prior to Jan. 1, up from 21 percent last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more worrisome than if they were doing something about
it,'' said spokesman Jim Weidman.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the UN's Y2K center in Washington was to release a report
Thursday warning that upgrade work must continue at nuclear power
plants worldwide, even after New Year's Day, to prevent Y2K-related
problems from reducing safety margins.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, forecasts about possible disruptions can have an
impact on decisions by consumers and businesses as to how much
food, fuel, and cash to stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Hoarding itself could prove disruptive. But partly because of
the rosy outlook described by Koskinen and others, it seems, locals
banks including Fleet Boston Financial and Citizens Financial Group
report no increase in cash withdrawals lately.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespeople for Stop &AMP; Shop Supermarket Co. and Shaw's
Supermarkets Inc. say items such as bottled water and canned goods
don't seem to be selling any more than usual. Other retailers
including Hannaford Bros., Poland Spring Water Corp. and BJ's
Wholesale Club Inc. report higher-than-expected sales, but decline
to quantify the increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see a buying frenzy,'' said Ann Davin, spokeswoman
for Gillette Co.'s Duracell battery brand.
</P>
<P>
   To some observers, the lack of a clear sales boom suggests
officials have not done enough work to encourage preparations,
beyond suggesting households keep three to seven days' food, water,
and cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that preventing panic was more important than
solving the problem has won out,'' said Leon Kappelman, a professor
at the University of North Texas who has advised government
planners on Y2K. ``I hope that was a good decision; I don't think
it was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen says he sees no basis for greater calls for alarm,
however, and even many skeptics say they don't expect most
Y2K-related problems to strike major cities and corporations on New
Year's Day. In fact, fewer than 10 percent of Y2K-related failures
will occur in the two weeks surrounding Jan. 1, according to a
report by the Gartner Group consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Capers Jones, a computer scientist at Artemis Management Systems
in Burlington, said he is most worried about the impact Y2K might
have on local utilities, water systems, chemical companies, and
smaller municipalities that haven't spent the resources addressing
the problems.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases these problems might not become apparent until
mid-January, he said. By that time, payroll or billing systems
could break down. Plus, there is too little hard data about the
preparations by individual companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of agree with people like Koskinen'' that disruptions
won't be major at first, Jones said. ``But as you drop down into
the medium to small companies, the availability and quality of the
data about what's going to happen to them becomes useless or
dreadful.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he notes the Massachusetts Emergency Management
Agency hasn't rated the preparations of municipalities around the
state, making it hard to know which are most vulnerable to
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Judge, a spokesman for the emergency agency, says that's
fine because state officials have met with representatives from
each of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts this year to
review their Y2K plans. Often this meant making sure officials had
current phone numbers for local residents with generators to loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gone in and audited the results, so it's easy to
take shots,'' Judge said. ``But local officials will have to speak
to somebody, so there's going to be a lot of accountability if
things go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Val Asbedian, a Massachusetts planning official charged with
leading the Cellucci administration's response to Y2K, says he's
chiefly concerned that water, electricity, and telecommunications
systems function into the new year. And now that he's heard
assurances from Boston Edison parent NStar, Bell Atlantic, and
other providers, he's not so concerned about what else might occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the water pumps, and the lights and phones are working,
most anything else that happens is something that's going to be
manageable,'' he said.

`TOPSY-TURVY': GILBERT AND SULLIVAN GET BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subbing to note the film's accolade from the New York Film Critics
Circle)  
(jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy,'' which was shown as part of this year's New York
Film Festival, was chosen Thursday as the best film of 1999 by the
New York Film Critics Circle. Following are excerpts from Janet
Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Leigh's grandly entertaining ``Topsy-Turvy'' is one of
those films that create a mix of erudition, pageantry and
delectable acting opportunities, much as ``Shakespeare in Love''
did last year. Instead of a lovestruck young playwright, it
presents the curiously matched personalities of the librettist
William Schwenk Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan in the
midst of a robust, knowing, frequently hilarious look at the
musical theater over which they held sway.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh orchestrates this delightful film so well that he
fittingly presents his own directorial credit just as Sullivan,
preparing to conduct the new operetta ``Princess Ida'' in 1884,
takes an introductory bow.
</P>
<P>
   This is an interesting place for the story of ``Topsy-Turvy'' to
start. Because when ``Princess Ida'' turns out to be a dud, it
means a dead end for the Gilbert and Sullivan oeuvre and a
challenge to these established hit-makers to reinvent themselves
rather late in the game. Leigh and his large array of performers,
who obviously lived and breathed their roles before filming (in
keeping with the filmmaker's customary method), vigorously and
amusingly explore what it means for an artist to renew his energies
by returning to square one.
</P>
<P>
   As the film begins, the newly knighted Sir Arthur Sullivan (the
excellent Allan Corduner) has begun to turn away from the kind of
comic operetta that won him wealth and celebrity. He has also grown
so distant from the not-yet-titled Gilbert that the two men do not
cross paths until well into the story. The dour Gilbert, played
with wonderfully literate crankiness by Jim Broadbent, is too prim
and stubborn to understand his partner's dissatisfaction. Only when
the famous impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook) tries to
force his stars to settle their differences does Gilbert have to
acknowledge a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Though the differences between these two strong personalities
are deftly captured, ``Topsy-Turvy'' (which takes its title from
Sullivan's dismissive view of Gilbert's tidy plot contrivances) is
much bigger than their story. Its aspirations are thrilling in
their own right. Leigh's gratifyingly long view of life in the
theater (Gilbert has a dentist who tells him ''Princess Ida'' could
have been shorter) includes not only historical and biographical
details but also the painstaking process of creating a Gilbert and
Sullivan production from the ground up. The film details all this
with the luxury of a leisurely pace, as opposed to a slow one.
</P>
<P>
   The Gilbert and Sullivan turnaround begins with a lightning bolt
of inspiration, in the form of a London exhibition on Japanese
culture. Gilbert's wife (Lesley Manville) drags him to see this,
and somewhere in the midst of the kimonos and Kabuki, ``The
Mikado'' is born. The latter half of ``Topsy-Turvy'' describes
everything about creating this operetta, as in a wonderful sequence
that creates the famous fluttering and tippy-toeing to ``Three
Little Maids From School.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are Gilbert's priceless ideas about how to direct
actors. Broadbent's role is beautifully written (``I'm sure we
shall reap the benefits of your remonstrations in the fullness of
time,'' he tells one complainer), as is the actors' side of the
story. One performer is heard to complain about management,
``particularly when the management have difficulty in locating the
various whereabouts'' of the posterior and the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   As ``The Mikado'' takes shape, the film offers exultant excerpts
performed by actors who are as comfortable in full stage regalia as
they are behind the scenes. Well trained by Gilbert to pronounce
words like ``persiflage'' and ``corroborative,'' the performers (a
fine troupe including Timothy Spall, Shirley Henderson and familiar
faces from earlier Leigh films) make it a palpable triumph. But for
Gilbert, who calls his mother ``the vicious woman who bore me into
this ridiculous world,'' there are no happy endings. ``There's
something inherently disappointing about success,'' he insists.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh's ``Topsy-Turvy'' is delightful proof to the contrary.

 &HT;    Barr will pitch $2 million battle for House seat
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Bob Barr rode to Congress during the 1994
Republican Revolution. Now the Georgia Republican is fighting hard
to avoid becoming one of its casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party is targeting Barr, among others, in a
sweeping effort to wrest control of the House away from the GOP.
With a razor-thin, five-seat voting margin and 19 incumbent
Republicans declining to run again, the Democrats see an
opportunity to win back the chamber they ran for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Already there are three candidates running for the Democratic
nomination in Georgia's 7th Congressional District. And the race is
turning into a high-stakes game between Barr and a leading
Democrat. It is predicted they will need to raise at least $2
million each _ nearly $700,000 more than Barr's arsenal in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that the Democrats are after Barr. They've
relished the idea ever since he became the first member of Congress
to call for impeaching President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   What's surprising is how seriously they are taking a candidate
who comes from a district that is considered comfortably
Republican. Clinton won just 40 percent of the vote in the 7th
District during the 1996 presidential election. By comparison,
Clinton carried the congressional districts of Georgia Republicans
Saxby Chambliss and Charlie Norwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barr is very vulnerable,'' said Rep. Martin Frost (D-Texas),
the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and former head of the
congressional campaign committee that doles out campaign dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Barr is in more trouble than he realizes, Frost said, and it's
not just because of his active role during the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Barr had the narrowest margin of victory in the Georgia
delegation in 1998. His challenger that year, Jim F. Williams, won
45 percent of the vote with a shoestring budget of $13,000.
</P>
<P>
   Barr could face much stiffer competition this time. One of the
Democrats, businessman Roger Kahn, has said he would raise $2
million with or without the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a race that we'll look at closely,'' Frost said.
``It will be a very interesting race that bears national
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the upcoming race, Barr is almost sanguine.
After all, he predicted at the close of the impeachment trial that
he would be a victim of what he called the ``revenge factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr knows that he is a ``targeted'' man, but he predicts that
will only help him raise money and convince conservatives to get
out and vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly anticipate that they will throw everything,
including the kitchen sink, at me,'' Barr said. ``That's what
happens when you have a vindictive president and a Democratic
machine running the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr's supporters are just as ferocious as his detractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Barr will have an enormous amount of help from
conservatives,'' said Matt Glavin, director of the Southeastern
Legal Foundation, a conservative-leaning legal group based in
Georgia. ``He is one of the heroes of the conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is the paradox of Bob Barr, the politician, said Alan
Abramowitz, professor of political science at Emory University.
People either love him or they hate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very polarizing figure,'' Abramowitz said. The 7th
District is not considered a marginal district, he said, but with
Barr in the seat, a Republican victory is not so clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   The national pundits have singled out Chambliss and Norwood as
vulnerable. They've based that on how well Clinton did in their
districts during the last election.
</P>
<P>
   But Abramowitz thinks the hottest race will be in Barr's
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Barr you are going to have a struggle because people are
strongly in favor of him or really negative about him,'' Abramowitz
said. ``There is no question that this will be an extremely intense
race.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll conducted by Alabama-based Anzalone Research on
behalf of Kahn's campaign found that just 40 percent of the
district's voters feel that Barr should be re-elected and 47
percent said that it was time to give ``someone new a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Kahn said he would run a campaign based on
local issues such as making schools safer, saving Social Security,
restoring Medicare cuts and curbing violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that Mr. Barr was working on national issues, but they
weren't issues that would benefit the people of the 7th District,''
Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who is again seeking the Democratic nomination,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used his position as a mouthpiece for the radical right of
the Republican Party, instead of for the 7th District,'' he said.
``Barr spent 1 1/2 years of his personal time trying to get Bill
Clinton out of office,'' Williams said. ``That is a waste of time
and money.''
</P>
<P>
   The third candidate, Chip Warren, was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Barr is proud of his record.
</P>
<P>
   ``My record is my record,'' Barr said. ``How could I regret
doing the right thing?''
</P>
<P>
   As for Kahn's poll, is Barr worried?
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Kahn's silly little press release,'' Barr said. ``It's
really silly for someone to put out a release saying, `Hey I'm only
behind by `X' number of points.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said he knew what he was getting into when he first decided
to focus a spotlight on the president's ethics.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip with his wife, Jeri, he started reading up on
impeachment law.
</P>
<P>
   Jeri asked him if he knew what could happen. ``She said, `Do you
realize what they'll do to you?'''
</P>
<P>
   But Barr thinks he won the impeachment battle. Although Clinton
is still in office, he did become only the second president to be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be his legacy,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   And Barr's legacy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always believed that as long as I'm doing the right
thing, it doesn't matter what they say about me,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   But he does take their challenge seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to,'' he said. ``But I will mount a vigorous
fund-raising campaign.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The ultimate indignity occurred six days ago,
during a down moment in the only home loss of the season for the
defending NBA champions.
</P>
<P>
   A fan caught David Robinson's ear as the Spurs were inexplicably
falling to the lowly Washington Wizards, 99-89.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Hey, I'm from Oakland,' '' Robinson recounted. `I
could have stayed home and watched the Warriors if I wanted to see
this.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Title Defense 101 in the NBA. The Spurs are where
they want to be in the standings _ on top of their division _ but
nowhere else. They host the Celtics Friday night, and it would
surprise no one here if Boston, which last won in San Antonio in
February, 1990, and has lost 11 of 12 to the Spurs, won the game.
We are not making this up.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Spurs rallied in the fourth quarter to beat
Houston, 83-77. It was like a lot of NBA games, where the home
team, the better team, outlasted the exuberant, inexperienced
visitors. Tim Duncan called it an ugly win, said the team still
hadn't found its rhythm or flow, but also said he was satisfied
with the result.
</P>
<P>
   A local television reporter made the mistake of assuming head
coach Gregg Popovich felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be satisfied with the result, no matter how ugly,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be satisfied? I do? Why don't you ask me if I am?''
Popovich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you?'' the reporter asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Popovich went on. ``I thought we played poorly. We looked
confused, discombobulated. We obviously have a helluva lot of work
to do. Right now, we're playing poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   This is from the coach whose team won the game. This is from the
coach whose team is 17-7 while trying to overcome the loss of a
valuable starter from last year's title team, trying to prevent
complacency from settling in, trying to deal with a group of
graybeards in a league designed to help the high and frequent
flyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have won their last two games. Big deal. The loss to
the Wizards _ the Wizards! _ was the fourth in five games.
Statistically, they look pretty strong; Rick Pitino, for instance,
would like to have their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But there's something missing which everyone acknowledges. Many
things, really. It's the (temporary?) loss of Sean Elliott, still
hoping to come back after a summer kidney transplant. It's having a
bull's-eye on the uniform, something which comes with the territory
of being the NBA champion. It's what Popovich likes to call
``residual satisfaction.'' It's age: The Spurs are the oldest team
in the league with a starting backcourt (Avery Johnson, Mario Elie)
whose ages look like a dream round at Carnoustie: 34-36. One of the
top reserves is Terry Porter, 36.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team is all about chemistry,'' Robinson said. ``We have to
trust each other and play together; when we do that, we're very
good. But, obviously, when we don't, we're not a great team. We saw
that very clearly last year, and once we made the commitment to
each other, we turned it around. That's what's gotta happen with
this group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he went on, ``there's too many mental mistakes.
There's too much garbage. We're not on the same page yet. We can't
fool ourselves. We can't think we're so overwhelming. It's not like
you can come in this locker room, look around, and say, `Wow, we're
going to win every night.' We're not like Portland or LA, with a
lot of physical talent, so that if things break down, you might win
the game just on the basis of that physical talent. We can't do
that. We have to win playing together.''
</P>
<P>
   The record, Popovich feels, is ``fake . . . inflated.'' He's got
a point. The Spurs have yet to play the Lakers, Trail Blazers,
SuperSonics or Kings. They've played Utah once. They have traveled
_ they've played 13 road games _ but they've also fattened up on a
lot of flotsam.
</P>
<P>
   Slow starts, of course, are nothing new here. As Avery Johnson
noted, ``Thank God we're not 9-11 like we usually are.'' Last year,
the Spurs were 6-8 before they made a quick U-turn and won 31 of
their last 36.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same exact thing as last year. It's just something
that this group does,'' Popovich said. ``I'm wondering if I'm doing
something coaching-wise which starts out with mass confusion, and
then I gotta get it all straight. Because it's certainly not a plan
of mine. I'm not some amazing genius who says, `We're going to
start out really slow, we're going to be really confused, but by
the time we get to the playoffs . . . '
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be perfect now and win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying all this is the uncertain status of Duncan, the
franchise's most prized asset. One has to wonder how he feels
looking around at all these guys who were playing NBA basketball in
short shorts while he was still working at the 400 freestyle on St.
Croix. He can't do anything until next summer, but that restriction
does not prevent him from tipping his hat. He hasn't, and he won't.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan personally saved them last week from even greater
humiliation than a home loss to Washington _ a home loss to
Vancouver _ with a career-high 42 points. He led the way Wednesday
with 20 points, 10 rebounds and 4 blocks. But a quick scan of the
San Antonio roster shows only four players born in the 1970s _
Duncan (23), good pal Antonio Daniels (24), Malik Rose (25) and
Samaki Walker (23.) The next youngest player is Chucky Brown. He's
31.
</P>
<P>
   The status of Duncan may be paramount in the long term, but in
the short term, it's not at the top of Popovich's list. He has said
he supports Duncan's desire to test free agency (read: Orlando),
and the voters of San Antonio last month approved a new arena for
the Spurs. But by the time that building is up and running,
three-fourths of the team could well be retired and Duncan could be
elsewhere, a prospect no one here wants to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term goal is beating the Celtics. Popovich recalled
San Antonio's easy win last month in Boston (121-98) and said,
without equivocation, ``that this will be a lot tougher game for
us. Then again, every game is a danger game for us right now. We're
so inconsistent in excecution. Then we get mad at ourselves for not
doing it. We're going through a real tough time right now.''

</P>
<P>
   DVD had a good year, and so did documentaries. Silent films
flourished, and, as always, there was room for odd pursuits and
first-timers on tape. For example, ``Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why
Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?'' (1971), with Dustin
Hoffman as a tortured rock composer, finally appeared in a
cassette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hold it in my hand,'' said Herb Gardner, somewhat
disbelievingly. He wrote the screenplay for the film, adapting it
from his play. Apparently the movie just got lost for a while.
``Nobody knew who owned it,'' he said. Now that has been clarified,
and the video is from Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Monte Hellman's road film ``Two-Lane Blacktop'' (also 1971)
found the path to video blocked by music rights _ not relating to
the film's star, James Taylor, but for songs like ``Moonlight
Ride'' by the Doors and ``Satisfaction'' by the Rolling Stones. The
film was released on cassette and DVD for the first time by Anchor
Bay. ``I'd like a nice copy to show my kids,'' Hellman said.
</P>
<P>
   For unusual activities, there was Abbas Kiarostami's ``Taste of
Cherry'' from Home Vision, in which a dispirited middle-aged man
drives around the Iranian countryside looking to hire someone to
bury his body after he commits suicide. And in Darren Aronofsky's
``Pi,'' from Artisan, a young man labors over the irrational
number, raising, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times,
``age-old questions about the relationships between genius and
insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Silent films gained steadily on tape and DVD. From Kino came
``Strike'' (1924), Sergei Eisenstein's wildly innovative first
feature, in which mounted troops ride right into apartment
buildings after demonstrators. The silent film of the year,
however, was ``The Passion of Joan of Arc,'' Carl Theodor Dreyer's
austere classic of 1928, in a superb DVD special edition from the
Criterion Collection.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the documentaries. On cassette from A&AMP;E was
``The Farm: Angola, U.S.A.,'' a film about prison life in Louisiana
that received an Oscar nomination. The prize-worthy ``Nobody's
Business,'' Alan Berliner's 1996 film about his father, was
released by Milestone.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian documentary released on video in the United States by
Winstar, ``Rock 'n' Roll Invaders'' tells the stories of some major
American disc jockeys. Joseph Dorman's ``Arguing the World,'' from
First Run, covers America's political progression from '30s
socialism to '80s conservatism as viewed by four New York
intellectuals: Irving Kristol, Daniel Bell, Nathan Glazer and
Irving Howe.
</P>
<P>
   Running more than eight hours, Jennifer Fox's acclaimed
``American Love Story,'' from New Video, explores the 30-year
relationship between a black musician and a white businesswoman.
</P>
<P>
   As for DVD's, some nice boxed sets appeared this year, including
seven Stanley Kubrick films from Warner, 10 Francois Truffauts from
Fox Lorber and seven James Bonds from MGM. And the discs look all
right on a shelf (better than cassettes, at any rate).

   American Pie
</P>
<P>
   With plenty of emphasis on crude exploration and gross-out body
functions, four high school boys labor toward the promised land:
loss of their virginity by graduation day. Only Kevin (Thomas Ian
Nicholas) is virtually in bed with a girl (Tara Reid). The others
have problems.
</P>
<P>
   Jim (Jason Biggs) pins his hopes on a geekish flute player
turned dominatrix. Oz (Chris Klein), the lumbering jock, takes up
singing and flower-arranging to lure Heather (Mena Suvari) while
Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) offers $200 to the sexually active
Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) to spread word of his prowess (as yet
untested).
</P>
<P>
   ``Like an upper-middle-class `Porky's,''' Stephen Holden wrote
in The New York Times, `American Pie' is unable to transcend its
own dirty mind.''

hair can't come up with a lot of money in 20 minutes, her boyfriend
(Moritz Bleibtreu) will be killed.
</P>
<P>
   Then the fun is in the details on a dash that leads from her
father's office through assorted encounters. When one sprint is
over, it is erased and the game starts ov the events altered
with ``a vigor and pizazz that offset the essentially empty nature
of the exercise'' (Janet Maslin).

   In an Italian-American neighborhood in the Bronx, a sex machine
named Vinny (John Leguizamo) clashes with Ritchie (Adrien Brody), a
friend who has adopted rebellious affectations. With two tough

 &HT;    Gingriches kept apart as divorce mediation begins
 &HT;    By Duane Stanford
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich and Marianne Gingrich spent Thursday
afternoon with a mediator in their first attempt to resolve their
bitter divorce.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether they were making any real progress.
</P>
<P>
   For at least the first two hours of the court-ordered session,
the Gingriches remained in separate rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each party is in a conference room, and the mediator goes back
and forth between each group,'' said Tom Browning, Newt Gingrich's
divorce attorney. ``I call it Henry Kissinger shuttle diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Browning said mediation generally includes a face-to-face
meeting at some point.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the split would be settled Thursday, Browning said he
was hopeful: ``You know, it's to their benefit. Those who are able
to settle their cases are going to save a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   John Mayoue, Marianne Gingrich's attorney, also offered few
hints about the mediation, which was being conducted in his law
offices near Cumberland Mall in Cobb County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinarily complex and difficult case. It's
fraught with a lot of emotions,'' Mayoue said. ``We're using our
best efforts today to get this matter resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Mediation is required of most civil cases in Cobb County
Superior Court, where Gingrich filed for divorce in July. The
couple has been married 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich's business attorney, Randy Evans, said the former
U.S. House speaker is ready to split all current assets with his
wife and pay her alimony. Marianne Gingrich hasn't said what her
terms for settlement would be. But she has been adamant about
deposing Callista Bisek, the House employee with whom Gingrich has
had a relationship for six years. That deposition probably will be
put off until early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingrich divorce so far has included a number of smaller
fights over money, information and the testimony of Bisek.
</P>
<P>
   The couple nearly went to court over a joint account set up to
protect their assets while the divorce is being sought. Much of the
money was earned this year, after Gingrich left Congress in
January. That dispute settled on whether Marianne Gingrich had
deposited all the funds from a joint company the couple had set up
this year before their split.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 9, Marianne Gingrich took her husband's lawyers to a
Cobb County courtroom and successfully asked a judge to order him
to answer 32 questions intended to dig up evidence about finances
and infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 23, Marianne Gingrich again went to court, this time in
Washington. There, a judge ordered Bisek to answer questions under
oath and provide records that might document her relationship with
Gingrich.

 &HT;    ACVB, Coke bottler promo a first
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those familiar red and white cartons of Coke will soon
contain a little something extra for consumers .
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Coca-Cola Bottling Co. has teamed up with the
Atlanta Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau for a joint marketing program
to promote the city and some of its top tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Dec. 27, more than 8,000 stores in Georgia will sell
special 12-can packs of Coke that sport a Super Bowl theme and
contain the Atlanta Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau logo. Inside the
1.4 million packs will be special commemorative Super Bowl XXXIV
cans.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, each pack will include an ``Around Atlanta''
discount book, including coupons to the NFL Experience, the World
of Coca-Cola and Underground Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   If coupons aren't enough, three winning game pieces good for
tickets to Super Bowl XXXV in Tampa in 2001 have been randomly
placed inside the Around Atlanta booklet.
</P>
<P>
   This may the first time the bottling company has joined a
convention and visitors bureau in a packaging promotion in the
United States, said Dan Lee, the company's director of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership began nearly a year ago. ``We started working on
a plan on how we both could benefit from a consumer promotion,''
Lee said. The company has relationships with many of the
attractions in the area, and the bureau helps promote many of them,
he said. ``It seemed a natural fit to bring all of us together.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the bottling company and the bureau will likely work on
other joint programs. Projects could include ``combining our forces
within the hotel, motel and restaurant industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Coca-Cola Bottling Co. is a division of Coca-Cola
Enterprises.

 CHRON   Make Holidays Jolly _ and Safe _ for Pets  
   
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Holidays can be anything except festive to a pet
that plays with decorations or feels neglected while the family
plays. Here are tips for a happier season from the Marin Humane
Society in California, Humane Society of the United States and
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seasonal greenery _ poinsettias, mistletoe, holly berries _
chocolate and food scraps can poison pets. Turkey bones can cause
choking or intestinal problems, and fatty foods can lead to painful
pancreatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Keep ornaments, lights, electrical cords and burning candles out
of paws' reach.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor a Christmas tree in its stand and let it remain
undecorated for a day while your pet gets used to having a tree in
the room. Avoid using aspirin in the tree water, since aspirin is
toxic to cats.
</P>
<P>
   Recycle or dispose of wrapping, tinsel, ribbons and other
decorations where pets can't find them.
</P>
<P>
   Spend time with your pet; neglected pets are more likely to
become destructive or try to escape.
</P>
<P>
   When you entertain, make sure your pet has a safe haven when it
can retreat from noise and strangers.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to travel, consider leaving your pet at home
with a pet sitter _ especially if you're traveling by air. More
than 5,000 animals, including pets, are killed, hurt or lost each
year while traveling by air.
</P>
<P>
   If you take your pet, make sure it wears identification. Cats
traveling by car should be in carriers. Dogs should be in carriers
or a pet restraint system.
</P>
<P>
   Don't give a pet as a gift, because the recipient may not want
it. However, some humane societies offer gift certificates for
adopting pets after the holiday season.

 CHRON   PLANT OF THE WEEK: All-America Cabbage  
   
   
 By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 Plant name:  `Savoy Express' cabbage (Brassica oleracea var.
sabauda).
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Type of plant: &LR;  Annual.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Description: &LR;  One of nine All-America Selections winners for
2000, this is the earliest small savoy cabbage. Plants grow up to a
foot high, though the head is only as large as 8 inches (1 to 13/4
pounds). Heads are slightly pointed and green, with a yellow-green
interior. The cabbage has a sweet flavor, and its crinkly leaves
provide texture in salads and stir-frys.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Microclimate: &LR;  In mild climates of the Bay Area, plant anytime
between January and May; avoid harvesting in August and September.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Special needs: &LR;  To grow from seed, sow indoors six weeks before
transplanting in the garden. Then plant 1 foot apart. Keep soil
moist.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Harvest: &LR;  About 55 days after transplanting.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Comments:  &LR; ``This is the earliest savoy cabbage in the world.
It also has very tender flavor, whereas a lot of the other savoys
can get somewhat bitter. Also, they are small plants, so if you are
a real cabbage nut, you can grow many, many heads of this savoy in
a smaller-space garden.'' _ Nona Koivula, All-America Selections.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Available at: &LR;  Seeds will be available in mail-order catalogs
this month, or send order to Geo. W. Park Seed Co., 1 Parkton Ave.,
Greenwood, SC 29647-0001.

 CHRON   OFF THE WALL: A Chip Off the Old Fire Log  
   
   
 By Holly Ocasio Rizzo  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  First came the fake fire log. It required no
sawing, shed no bark on the carpet and transported no hitchhiking
bugs. Now comes a better-than-fake log _ one that crackles as if it
had the knots and ripples of the real thing.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Called Crackleflame, it's a cousin of Duraflame.cq  &LR;  We put a
5-pound Crackleflame, the standard size, to the fire in a typical
San Francisco fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flame was no different from any other log, but there was a
faint crackle sound that sounds like nice dry firewood,'' our
tester, Rebecca Markowitz, said. ``It did not pop or throw sparks
out of the fireplace.''
</P>
<P>
   It also didn't smell like a natural log, since it's made of
sawdust mixed with waxes, but Markowitz said it wasn't unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   The log didn't burn hot but it lasted long _ about three
soothing hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Crackleflame was developed to satisfy consumers who missed
the sounds of a wood fire when using a Duraflame log.
</P>
<P>
   It lights the same way: Touch a match to the lighting strip that
runs down the side, and in about five minutes the single log
flickers like a grate full.
</P>
<P>
   But is the Crackleflame environmentally wise? Compared with
wood, officials at Stockton-based Duraflame Inc. say, it emits 69
percent fewer particulate, 87 percent less visible smoke, 88
percent less carbon monoxide and 66 percent less creosote, the
flammable gunk that can cause chimney fires.
</P>
<P>
   The suggested retail price is $2.49-2.79 a log, which works out
to $700-something a cord. Or pick up a three-pack for $7.49-8.79
and a case of six for $14.99-16.79.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHERE TO FIND IT
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Crackleflame logs are sold singly in supermarkets, department
stores and hardware stores where Duraflame logs are sold. Find
information, including frequently asked questions, about the logs
at  &LR; www.duraflame.com &LR; .

<P>
   &UR; GAME OF THE WEEK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Giants (7-6) at St. Louis (11-2)
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are climbing back into the playoff race because of
two things. First, Fassel has the team believing in miracles.
Second, Fassel has worked extensively, sometimes hours a day, with
quarterback Kerry Collins, correcting his faulty mechanics. Collins
is hot and the Giants are hot. The Rams have little to play for
because the team knows it is only a matter of time before they
claim home-field advantage in the playoffs. They may have to wait
until next week.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 20-15
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SATURDAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (5-8) at Kansas City (8-5)
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers are sliding fast, and the Chiefs are peaking.
Kansas City's offensive coordinator, Jimmy Raye, is doing some of
the best play calling in the league, relying heavily on what
coaches like to call ``bully ball.'' The Chiefs line up and ram the
football down a defense's throat, just as they did against
Minnesota on Monday night. In the 1990s when a Chiefs rusher has
over 30 carries, they are 78-5.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs, 20-12
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (4-9) at Carolina (6-7)
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Coach George Seifert is playing his old team, and who
would have thought that when Seifert faced his former employer he
would be fighting for a playoff spot and the 49ers would be dying a
slow death? The Panthers can smell the playoffs. That other stench
is a San Francisco defense that earlier this season allowed
Carolina to score 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers, 28-25
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY 1 P.M. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (3-10) at Tennessee (10-3)
</P>
<P>
   Falcons' coach Dan Reeves keeps flirting with the idea this may
be his last season as head coach of the Falcons. This game may make
his decision a little easier because it will get ugly. The Titans
are not a great team, but they are a solid one. Atlanta will see a
healthy dose of Eddie George, who needs only 85 yards to become the
fourth player in NFL history with at least 1,200 rushing yards in
each of his first four season. Titans quarterback Steve McNair has
been wearing a boot in practice to protect his injured ankle and
should play.
</P>
<P>
   Titans, 30-9
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (8-5) at Chicago (5-8)
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that Lions' quarterback Charlie Batch has a
small fracture in his throwing thumb. The good news is that his
backup, Gus Frerotte, has had a decent season. This game will be
extremely tight. The Bears almost beat Detroit on Thanksgiving Day.
What drives the Lions now are dreams of making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Lions, 17-14
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (12-1) at Cleveland (2-12)
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville running back James Stewart has a sprained left foot
and may not play. But Jaguars fans need not worry. Fred Taylor, who
had 1,223 yards last year, is as great a reserve as there is in the
league. No land mines for Jacksonville in this game _ they win
convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, 35-10
</P>
<P>
   New England (7-6) at Philadelphia (3-11)
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ty Law, who will miss the next two to four weeks with
a broken hand, is the latest piece of bad news for the Patriots.
Coach Pete Carroll will likely be fired at the end of the season.
After last week's loss to Indianapolis, quarterback Drew Bledsoe
apologized to owner Robert Kraft for his poor play. When players
start begging for forgiveness from management, that means trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles, 14-13
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (2-11) at Baltimore (6-7)
</P>
<P>
   Running back Ricky Williams likely will not play again this
season beccase of a variety of injuries. He was a good pick and is
a good player, but this season has been a disaster because the
Saints are so pitiful. Meanwhile the Ravens are beginning to show
why they have so much promise. They aim for their third straight
victories for the first time since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 21-3
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (6-7) at Miami (8-5)
</P>
<P>
   There is always trouble when those anonymous quotes from players
start popping up in the newspaper. That's what is happening in
Miami. There are questions on whether this is Jimmy Johnson's last
year, or Marino's. San Diego has a good defense led by end Raylee
Johnson's five sacks, but Marino has enough to get by and stay in
the playoff hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins, 17-10
</P>
<P>
   Washington (8-5) at Indianapolis (11-2)
</P>
<P>
   There are coaches in the NFL waiting for the Colts to slip. They
will have to keep waiting. Washington has enough offense to stay
with Indianapolis, but the Redskins are much too weak defensively
to stay with the Colts' impressive threesome of Peyton Manning,
Marvin Harrison and Edgerrin James.
</P>
<P>
   Colts, 35-22
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY, 4 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jets (5-8) at Dallas (7-6)
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are playing the role of spoilers, and they are the most
dangerous spoilers in years. The reason is backup quarterback Ray
Lucas _ he has not only proved he is a capable backup but a starter
in this league. His 85.2 rating, which is better than Troy
Aikman's, is third in the conference. Meanwhile, Dallas running
back Emmitt Smith is questionable with a groin injury. The Jets
will end any realistic hope of Dallas' winning the division.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 28-21
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (8-5) at Denver (4-9)
</P>
<P>
   Denver has played hard this season, and most of their games have
been close. This one should be as well. The last four meetings
between Seattle and the Broncos have been decided by seven points
or less. Denver has won 13 of the past 14 games at home against the
AFC West.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos, 19-16
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (9-4) at Oakland (6-7)
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers can clinch a playoff birth with a victory. What
quarterback Trent Dilfer could not do in years as the starting
quarterback _ just be steady and not mess things up _ rookie Shaun
King is doing in abundance. He is 2-0 in his starts with a 90.6
passer rating. As defensive lineman Warren Sapp is fond of saying,
all the team needs is a quarterback who won't make mistakes. The
defense will take care of the rest. Finally, Sapp has his wish.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers, 17-9
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (8-5) at Arizona (6-7)
</P>
<P>
   A Bills victory means the franchise would be assured of an
eighth winning season in the 1990s. More important, it would keep
them in the playoff race. This is an interesting game to follow.
Both teams are coming off brutal losses, the Bills to the Giants
and the Cardinals to Washington. Arizona's season is pretty much
over. The Bills win because they have more to play for.
</P>
<P>
   Bills, 20-13
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (7-6) at Minnesota (7-6)
</P>
<P>
   This is a position no one expected either team to be in: On the
outside of the playoff race looking in. What is most disappointing
is the Packers' defense. They are giving up 328 yards a game. There
remain rumors that retired Green Bay defensive end Reggie White
wants to bring his cleats back out of the closet. That won't
happen, and if it did, even the future Hall of Famer might not be
able to help this shellshocked bunch.

THIRD WORLD UNITED AGAINST CLINTON'S STAND ON LABOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The week after global trade talks collapsed
in Seattle, India's commerce minister rose in Parliament here to
denounce what he called a pernicious attempt by the richest, most
powerful nations _ led by President Clinton _ to rob developing
countries of their great advantage in trade: cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, what had really galvanized the developing
countries' rebellion against the creation of a working group on
labor in the World Trade Organization was Clinton's suggestion, in
an interview with a Seattle newspaper, of an eventual use of trade
sanctions against nations that failed to comply with international
labor standards.
</P>
<P>
   The commerce minister, Murasoli Maran, who was India's chief
representative at the talks, described Clinton's statements as
having electrified envoys from developing countries, made the
danger to their economic interests clear, and unified them in
opposition to any linkage of trade and labor standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, finally the last straw was cast by President Clinton
himself,'' Maran declared. ``It made all the developing countries
and least-developing countries to harden their position. It created
such a furor that they all felt the danger ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   In large part because of Clinton's handling of the issue, the
American attempt to add labor issues to the international trade
agenda widened the gulf between rich and poor nations and
contributed to the collapse of the latest efforts to further free
up world trade.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of India, Egypt and other third world nations,
Clinton's call to link trade accords to labor standards for workers
around the world was protectionism in the guise of idealism,
motivated by his desire to woo labor union support for the
presidential campaign of his vice president, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Some delegates from developing countries even expressed the
belief that he had orchestrated the sometimes violent street
protests in Seattle to justify the American position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Western world, the industrialized world, wants to take
away our comparative advantage,'' Maran said. ``It is a pernicious
way of robbing our comparative advantage. The developing countries
consider it as a maneuver by wealthy nations to force our wages up,
to undermine our competitiveness. This is the secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the inclusion of labor standards in trade deals
was not limited to government officials. In India, even labor
unions that regularly battle employers for higher wages and
improved benefits mostly opposed using trade negotiations as
leverage for a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Seattle talks, while American unions were planning
street demonstrations to demand that trade agreements protect
workers rights, Indian unions were quietly meeting government
officials and agreeing to oppose any linkage between trade and
labor standards.
</P>
<P>
   D.L. Sachdev, secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress,
which represents 2.5 million workers in industrial and service
jobs, said it was peculiar to stand on the same side as employers
and the government.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other labor leaders here maintained that making trade
agreements conditional on certain labor standards could be used to
keep out goods from low-wage countries like India, damaging workers
and employment in those industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, trade unions in developed countries feel that
because of cheap labor and relocation of industries by
multinational corporations, their employment prospects are
imperiled,'' Sachdev said.
</P>
<P>
   With the labor unions' backing, a group of Cabinet ministers
headed by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee agreed before India's
delegation left for Seattle that India would oppose the proposal
for a working group on labor and trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an issue on which there could be compromise,''
said N.K. Singh, a civil servant who is one of Vajpayee's top
advisers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The developing countries won vigorous intellectual backing from
a group of African, Latin American and Asian academics, led by
Columbia University economist Jagdish Bhagwati. They, as well as a
variety of labor and nongovernmental leaders, signed a statement
against including labor and environmental issues in trade treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Their contention was that the labor issues in particular are
selectively used against developing countries for the economic gain
of the richer nations. For example, Clinton had singled out child
labor, a problem of developing countries like India, but had made
no mention of lax enforcement of laws to protect workers in garment
sweatshops or migrant farm workers laboring in abominable
conditions in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bhagwati, who began calling for India to open up to foreign
trade and investment 25 years before it began to do so, said the
signatories stand strongly against child labor and bad working
conditions, but believe trade deals are the wrong place to combat
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian delegation arrived in Seattle with no expectation
that the labor issue would be at the top of the American agenda.
Just a month earlier, Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade
representative, had met in Lausanne, Switzerland, with ministers
from more than 20 countries, including India, Brazil, Egypt, South
Africa and Argentina, and assured them that the United States only
wanted a group that would study labor issues, officials here said.
It had no intentions of taking the matter any further.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trade talks collapsed Dec. 3, Clinton has said India
and Pakistan _ another outspoken opponent of labor standards _ had
misunderstood his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he had not meant to suggest the United States
would cut off American markets to India and Pakistan if they did
not raise wages to American levels.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials and labor leaders here say they see the
United States calculatingly pursuing its own interests on trade _
and they are girding for future battle.
</P>
<P>
   Maran, speaking in Parliament, said, ``If you ask me to tell you
in one word what happened in Seattle, my answer will be, `We have
postponed D-Day.'''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Proving once again that it can mount a boutique of a
show with the same panache as a five-alarm blockbuster, the
Metropolitan Museum has unveiled an exquisite sampling of
20th-century design objects from its own collection.
</P>
<P>
   A salute rather than a full survey, ``A Century of Design, Part
1: 1900-1925'' is installed in several intimate galleries in the
20th-century wing. It displays more than 50 examples of furniture,
metalwork, glass, ceramics, textiles, jewelry and drawings, from a
fanciful Pompeian-style dressing table of bronze and basalt by the
French designer Armand-Albert Rateau to a silver claret jug with
sinuous curves and flyaway thumb-piece, the work of the English
craftsman Archibald Knox.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, which runs through March 26, is the first in a
four-part series on 20th-century design, organized by J. Stewart
Johnson, consultant for design and architecture in the museum's
department of modern art, that will extend into the year 2001.
``Part 1'' focuses on the three major design currents of the period
1900 to 1925: Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau and Art Deco. The
star-studded roster includes Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Josef
Hoffmann, Frank Lloyd Wright, Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann, Peter
Behrens, Emile Galle, Rene Jules Lalique, Koloman Moser, Paul
Poiret, Gio Ponti and Eliel Saarinen.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 19th century, designers were rebelling against
the furbelows of Victorian style with its overblown machine-made
furniture in hodgepodge designs that battened on the past. Fueled
by the utopian ideals of John Ruskin and William Morris _ honesty
of expression, materials and workmanship and the elevation of
applied arts to the level of fine arts _ the revisionist Arts and
Crafts movement was born. To its practitioners, handmade was good,
machine-made unbearable, although from a production standpoint,
they soon came to see the necessity of mechanical help.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great Arts and Crafts proponents was the Austrian
architect Josef Hoffmann (1870-1956), who in 1903, with the painter
and furniture designer Koloman Moser (1868-1918), founded the
influential Wiener Werkstatte (Vienna Workshops). A design
cooperative described by Hoffmann in 1904 as ``a center of gravity
surrounded by the happy noise of handicraft production and welcomed
by everybody who truly believed in Ruskin and Morris,'' it affected
the spirit and substance of European decoration for more than 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the objects by Hoffmann on view is a playfully inventive
1904 table lamp of glass and copper with silvery hammered surfaces.
Made when the shift from gas to electricity challenged designers to
accommodate the new technology, it has electric lights that are
sheltered under a flaring, unshaded top, their shapes and
luminosity echoed by dangling silver spheres.
</P>
<P>
   With Moser, Hoffmann also designed an armchair (1903) that seems
more in keeping with the restrained, geometric architecture for
which he was noted. Essentially a spare, open cube whose top and
sides are supported by elongated diamond slats, it has a cane seat
of painted squares in black and white; the whole is a smart,
elegant triumph of Minimalism.
</P>
<P>
   Parallel with Arts and Crafts ran Art Nouveau, an offshoot of
that movement and of Symbolism, the late 19th-century art and
literary manifestation whose imagery was generated by ideas, moods
and emotions. Art Nouveau's exaggeratedly asymmetrical style, also
a revolt against 19th-century historicism, used a linear vocabulary
based on organic forms: plant shapes, flames, waves, flowing hair
and such. The term comes from the name of a shop, L'Art Nouveau,
opened in Paris in 1895 by Siegfried Bing, which sold original as
opposed to period work.
</P>
<P>
   The movement in its full Continental flower is evident in a
formidable cabinet-vitrine, dated 1899, by the Belgian architect
and decorator Gustave Serrurier-Bovy (1858-1910). A tall structure
of light-reddish wood standing more than eight feet tall, with two
glass-front cabinets and two drawers, it is embellished with
sinuous Art Nouveau relief carvings and bright enameling on the
repousse metal handles and key plates.
</P>
<P>
   A less typical but more important representative of the Art
Nouveau movement was Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868-1928), the
Scottish architect, designer, decorator and painter, whose
restrained endeavors departed from the more florid effusions of
Continental designers. Using oak painted in black or white,
Mackintosh produced chairs, settees, benches, card tables and
cabinets in a distinctively clean, linear style, often embellished
with small incised decorations and opaque colored glass.
</P>
<P>
   One of the show's knockout pieces is Mackintosh's oak washstand
of 1904, made for the ``blue bedroom''  Cranston; the
Glasgow tearooms he designed for her in 1897 provided his first
commercial success. A sturdy-looking piece in light-colored oak,
the washstand has a counter of tiled blue ceramic and a backsplash
of leaded glass in brilliant shades of blue overlaid by a stylized
floral design abloom with green glass and mirrors. Less exuberant
than the French and Belgian versions of Art Nouveau, it is more
evocative of Jugendstil, the contemporaneous Nouveau mode in
Austria and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Art Deco, the movement or movements that developed out of Art
Nouveau, took its name from the 1925 design fair in Paris,
l'Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels
Modernes. But it had begun to establish itself in the years just
before World War I. The best of it was unabashedly elitist;
although it posed as new, it was essentially conservative.
Inspiration came from traditional late 18th- and early 19th-century
furniture models. The French version, for instance, shows
Directoire and Empire influences, bringing seating closer to the
ground with tables lowered to match. (The birth of the cocktail
table is credited to Art Deco.)
</P>
<P>
   The high-fashion breed of Art Deco stressed luxury materials
like exotic woods and Chinese lacquer, with trims in ivory,
shagreen (rawhide patterned like sharkskin) and even
mother-of-pearl. Smooth, shiny surfaces showed off the expensive
materials. Geometric and rounded shapes _ angles, arcs, circles and
lines _ and colors in black, gray, white, silver and red later came
to characterize the style.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important of the French Deco cabinet makers was
Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann (1879-1933), a superb technician whose
craftsmanship equaled that of the finest 18th-century artisans. The
elegant curves of his desk, desk chair and file cabinet (1918-23),
in precious wood with ivory trim, manage to look formal and
discreetly sexy at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable Art Deco pieces in the show include a rosewood
stool (circa 1925) by Pierre Legrain, adapted from a traditional
African form; Edgar Brandt's massive ``Persia'' door of forged iron
with an openwork design of large floral blossoms (circa 1923), and
a suave table (1924) by Clement Rousseau whose top, a sort of ebony
tray, is supported between two high arches of ebony partly wrapped
in sharkskin that serve as legs.
</P>
<P>
   Small and select as it is, the show makes a graceful tribute to
an avant-garde century.

TRADE DEFICIT SWELLS TO $25.9 BILLION, 7TH RECORD THIS YEAR

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's trade deficit swelled again in October, to $25.9
billion, setting a record for the seventh time this year as
prosperous American consumers and businesses kept up their spending
spree. Exports were essentially unchanged, while imports continued
to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Higher prices for imported oil, on which the United States
relies for more than half its needs, more than offset reduced
volume and accounted for one-fourth of the October gap, which was
much larger than expected. Record deficits with China and Japan
accounted for more than half of the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer demand in the U.S. is extremely strong,'' said Bill
Sharp, senior economist at Chase Securities, predicting that
booming sales of foreign cars would contribute to a further
widening of the deficit in the coming months. Weak growth among
various Asian and European trading partners, on the other hand, has
caused demand for American goods to lag.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very rapid growth of our economy vis-a-vis the rest of
the world,'' said William C. Dudley, chief U.S. economist at
Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   The wider trade gap provides some ammunition for those who have
been contending that the United States is being victimized by the
unfair labor practices of other countries and that American workers
need some protection, perhaps by imposing higher labor and
environmental standards on some trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   This was a significant contention at the recent World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle, where efforts to start a new round
of trade liberalization failed amid unexpectedly widespread
protests.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an agreement under which the United States supports
China's bid to join the WTO, in exchange for better access to
Chinese markets, is still subject to approval by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   William Daley, the commerce secretary, cited the far faster rate
of American economic growth as the main reason for the growing
trade imbalance but warned of the political problems it posed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have carried much of the burden,'' he said, referring to
the way the United States has bought large quantities of goods from
economically struggling trading partners, especially in Asia.
``Politically, that gets very difficult over a long period and
other countries have to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise in imports during October was 1.6 percent, to a record
$107.9 billion, with the biggest increases in computer-related and
other capital goods, including semiconductors. Some analysts had
expected imports of semiconductors to decline because of an
earthquake in Taiwan in September. Meanwhile, the nation's bill for
imported oil reached a new peak of $6.4 billion as the average
price rose to $20.74 a barrel from $19.52 even as the number of
imported barrels fell.
</P>
<P>
   Exports edged down 0.1 percent, to $81.9 billion, with
telecommunications equipment one of the biggest drags.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 10 months of the year, exports have climbed
1.9 percent compared with figures in the period a year earlier,
while imports have surged 10.7 percent. This has resulted in a
deficit running at an annual rate of $262 billion, far above last
year's peak of $164.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deficits with Japan and China each climbed to $7.2 billion
for the month, the most ever recorded with any country. The
widening with Japan was 8.1 percent; with China it was 3.6 percent.
Unlike the other figures, those involving individual countries or
other geographic areas are not adjusted for seasonal variations.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit with Mexico narrowed to $1.4 billion as both exports
and imports reached peaks, while the deficit with Canada, the
nation's biggest trading partner, rose to $3.2 billion. Record
imports from Western Europe helped push the American deficit with
the region to $5 billion, the report showed.
</P>
<P>
   While it will probably take the better part of next year before
the deficit starts to narrow, Dudley said, its growth should slow
and the dollar is not likely to weaken by a worrisome amount.
</P>
<P>
   The currency may be piling up in foreign hands, he said, but
American interest rates are already high enough to make investment
in the United States attractive. ``We're offering pretty good
terms,'' he said.

 &HT;    Cox cable adds African-American focus
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the battle for subscribers heats up among Internet
service providers, telecom and cable companies, Atlanta-based Cox
Communications has decided to focus some of its marketing efforts
on the African-American community.
</P>
<P>
   The company hired Images USA to develop a marketing strategy to
help attract minority subscribers in Cox markets across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Images will develop broadcast, print and outdoor advertising for
Cox cable, broadband and telephone service targeted specifically to
African-Americans. Images will also work with Cox on community
outreach plans, public relations and other grass-roots initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cox is developing and delivering a wide range of exciting new
services, and we want to offer those services to as wide a customer
base as possible,'' said Joe Rooney, vice president for marketing,
Cox Communications. Following the close of pending cable system
acquisitions, Cox will serve about 6 million customers nationwide,
making it the nation's fifth-largest cable company.
</P>
<P>
   (Cox Communications is a public company controlled by privately
held Cox Enterprises, parent company of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Images says that the technology industry,
although still relatively young, hasn't yet begun seriously
marketing to specific demographics. ``Automobiles and fast-food
restaurants target to specific groups,'' says Images public
relations director Hank Ernest. ``They've targeted, they've tested
and they know it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research senior analyst Dan O'Brien agrees that Cox's
marketing strategy is a good one. ``With all the news about ISPs
and free ISPs and the deals Microsoft has made with Best Buy and
Radio Shack, Internet access has gotten cheaper, and there isn't
that price hurdle to get over.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Cox has the local focus and brings in a channel in Spanish
or an African channel, that does make sense, and they can drive
advertising there,'' he said. (Cox Interactive Media produces local
Internet portals in all of its markets, as well as an excellent
stand-alone site. Blackfamilies
</P>
<P>
   .com.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a lot of sense,'' said O'Brien. ``These lower-priced
ISPs will jump-start the adoption rate for home PCs that much of
the population hasn't really embraced yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What will happen with Cox is they will get a leg up on other
tech-based firms in the African market,'' says Images' Ernest. ``If
you flip though most African-American magazines, you probably won't
see a targeted ad in the technology realm. Our plan is to
absolutely change that.''

 &HT;    On leave from monastery, baritone travels to perform
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Giorgio Cebrian, the singing monk, tours
the world, impersonating homicidal fathers (``Rigoletto''), mad
monarchs (``Nabucco''), crowned assassins (``Macbeth'') and, in
West Palm Beach, a slippery, serpentine diplomat in the production
of Andrea Giordano's ``Fedora.''
</P>
<P>
   He worships Verdi when he is not worshiping God. He carries a
photograph of Giuseppe Verdi with him in his travels, along with
his breviary of prayers. He speaks sincerely of leading ``a
consecrated life'' in a little hermitage in Siena, Italy, where he
will return to live in quiet contemplation after his magnificent
baritone voice deserts him, as it must someday. Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he is booked solid through 2005 and is proud of the
fact that he does his own makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know, they invited me to a reception here at your big
Hotel di lusso, what is it called? The Breakers?'' Cebrian said.
``It was a very lovely experience. People have practically cradled
me in their houses. Marvelous hospitality! And at a reception the
other night, they invited me to sing from `Rigoletto' _ I have done
`Rigoletto' 218 times _ Cortigiani, vil razza dannata! (O, you
damned vile race of place-seekers!) And there was a storm of
applause!''
</P>
<P>
   Since he emerged from his little Benedictine monastery in 1990,
with a special extra clausuram (''outside the cloister'')
permission from the Holy See in the Vatican, which must be renewed
every five years, Cebrian has left a worldwide trail of
stage-murders in his wake, each of them elaborately produced,
gorgeously costumed and backed up by some of the most compelling
music on earth.
</P>
<P>
   He will performed Monday in ``Fedora.'' He is not the lead
singer _ that honor, and the showpiece solo, ``Amor ti vieta,''
which launched the great Enrico Caruso's career at the premier of
the opera in 1898, belongs to Mikhail Davidoff, who plays opposite
Oksana Krovytska in the title role. Cebrian plays De Siriex, a
supple and worldly diplomat whose greatest moment in the opera is a
worldly, cynical song about ``La Dama Russa,'' the Russian woman,
her character, her strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   But he takes the role seriously, memorizing the responses as
fervently as an altar-boy learns how to answer at a Catholic Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opera that depends on single words,'' Cebrian says.
``You miss one word, you miss your cue. Yesterday, at the
siesta-hour, I remained awake in my dressing room, going over every
word of the part. It's a role that calls for a brilliancy in the
first act, and then you have to quietly fall apart and become
insufficient, yet maintain your character. That's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the costumes and swelling tides of music, Cebrian has had
a quiet war within himself, between the world and the spirit, a
life in which outward success masks deep loss and difficult
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had what you would call a 'vocation' early on in my life. I
tended toward the consecrated life, but my parents were opposed to
it. They wanted me to get married. And so I launched out on a
musical career and was very successful for a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played `Rigoletto' in 1971 with Alfredo Kraus. I did
`Carmen' in 1975 with Richard Tucker. I have been with conductors
like Claudio Abbado and Georges Pretre. It was a wonderful time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became engaged. She was a brilliant pianist, a beautiful,
wonderful woman. She died very tragically in a car accident just
four months before we were to be married. That outcome made a great
impression on me. It recalled me to my former wish, to become
religious, to lead a consecrated life. I had always felt the call,
you know, the vocation. And so finally I joined the Benedictines
and remained for seven years inside a monastery, dedicating myself
to the spiritual world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then one day, my abbot called me aside and said, `It is a pity
you do not display those gifts which God has given you to more
people.' It was a kind of miracle. So I prepared for one year to go
singing again, and I went back onstage with Martinu's `Epic of
Gilgamesh,' the premiere, at the Rome Opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then, I've played at La Scala in Milan, the Arena of
Verona, the Greek theater at Siracusa in Sicily. I did `La
Traviata' in Tokyo _ the Japanese are crazy for Verdi _ and now I'm
in Palm Beach with `Fedora.' Amazing, no?''
</P>
<P>
   Cebrian returns to his little monastery several times a year, on
holidays, but lives for the most part outside its walls. More and
more monks, he says, are finding work in the world outside the
cloister, work with the sick, the elderly, with drug addicts. The
motto of the Benedictine order, founded by St. Benedict in the
fifth century A.D., is Ora et Labora, work and pray.
</P>
<P>
   Work. Pray. Sing?
</P>
<P>
   ``My work is my singing,'' Cebrian says cheerfully. His vows
oblige him to fulfill certain religious duties daily, to observe
church rules and, as he puts it, ``to maintain the conduct of an
ordinary Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My monastery is my home. There is where I will go when my
voice gives out. If I die in an accident before then, all my
worldly goods go to my order, the Benedictines,'' he said. ``At the
end of my road, the monastery is always there.''

 &HT;    California-based competitor to buy Tradex Technologies
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tradex Technologies is being bought by Ariba, a California-based
competitor, for about $1.9 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Tradex, which recently moved its headquarters to metro Atlanta
from Tampa, develops Internet-based trade networks. The company
employs 185 people, 60 in Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   Ariba said it will issue 8.3 million shares to cover the
transaction. The deal is expected to close by June 30. Investors
were pleased with the deal, Ariba's second in two months. Ariba's
stock closed Thursday at $232.25, up $8.25, or 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Ariba paid $400 million for Trading Dynamics of
Mountain View, Calif. Ariba and Tradex were partners of Trading
Dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Ariba, which went public in June, has a market capitalization of
more than $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Tradex will operate as an Atlanta-based business unit of Ariba,
run by John Baumstock, Tradex's chief operating officer. Daniel
Aegerter, Tradex's 30-year-old founder, will become a senior market
strategist for Ariba. Aegerter moves to Brookhaven this weekend.
The moving van pulled up to his Tampa home soon after the deal
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Ariba is establishing itself as leader among the firms that
connect companies to their suppliers over the Internet. Its
competitors include Suwanee-based Clarus.
</P>
<P>
   Tradex develops tools that let suppliers bid on bulk-buying
contracts. A company such as American Express, a Tradex customer,
would use the technology to solicit bids for office supplies and
other needs.
</P>
<P>
   Tradex is privately held, with employees owning 40 percent of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Aegerter spun off Tradex from Dynabit, a Swiss computer
distributor, in 1996. Aegerter worked in Dynabit's U.S. purchasing
office, based in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Local venture capitalist John Imlay was among the early
investors. Imlay's partner, Sig Mosley, was a Tradex director.
</P>
<P>
   The pair helped steer Tradex from a firm with a software for
bidding on computer parts to a company that helps create Internet
markets between businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The market for Internet-based marketplaces has boomed lately.
Freemarkets went public last week and now has a market
capitalization of $8.5 billion. Tradex was poised to go public but
felt the price Ariba offered was a fair offer for shareholders,
Aegerter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a bigger mother ship with less volatility for our
shareholders than if we had gone out on our own,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dia Center for the Arts has a certain hauteur. It
tends to favor the minimalist-conceptualist elect, showing their
work in splendid isolation, fastidiously installed, for a year or
even more. Dia's efforts have a distinct intellectual slant that
can sometimes feel slightly medicinal. It is possible to emerge
from a Dia show feeling that good deeds have been done: by Dia, for
organizing it, and by oneself, for seeing it.
</P>
<P>
   But Dia may be unbending ever so slightly. Film, video and
photography, the current juggernauts of contemporary art, have
never been dominant at Dia, so it seems noteworthy that four of the
seven artists it is showing this fall are involved with at least
one of these media. Furthermore, in something of a departure from
Dia's splendidly isolated solo shows, the work of these four
artists is being presented in two two-person shows, which makes
comparisons natural.
</P>
<P>
   One show, ``Double Vision,'' juxtaposes video pieces by Stan
Douglas of Canada and Douglas Gordon of Scotland; both works use
side-by-side projections and are continuously screened in large,
dark rooms. Another two-artist show, ``Time Traced,'' brings
together series of large black-and-white photographs by Rodney
Graham, who is also Canadian, and Vera Lutter, a German artist.
They either use the camera obscura, or pinhole camera, or mimic the
effects of this rudimentary ancestor of photography, which was
invented during the Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   All these artists focus rather narrowly on the nature and
mechanics of their chosen media with a self-reflexiveness that
might be called formalist, but only Graham's photographs of
upside-down trees are fully engaging. At once brainy, accessible
and emotionally rich, they avoid this artist's tendency toward
conceptual opacity.
</P>
<P>
   The images, which measure about 8{ by 6 feet, were taken with a
large-format camera turned upside down; they imitate the camera
obscura's inversion, but not its fuzziness. Their precision is
dazzling. The trees are big, old and glorious, shot dead-on from a
distance in a leafless state; even the tiniest, highest twig
registers clearly. They make Joyce Kilmer's shopworn phrase, or
something close to it, spring to mind: if not God, then only nature
can make a tree. They also evoke a royal lineage of trees in art,
from 17th-century Dutch painting to Constable to the photographs of
Atget. Graham matter-of-factly proves the romantic notion that
every tree has a distinct personality, that branches can grow into
full, symmetrical halos or less regular, somewhat crazed ones.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the eye fights to maintain logic. The branches
can read as the underground root systems reaching downward into the
earth. Or they may suggest reflections, lakeside mirrorings of
actual trees that have been cropped out of the picture. But mainly,
the trees' majesty is dramatized and renewed by the oddness of
their inverted state.
</P>
<P>
   While Graham changes up to down, Ms. Lutter's luminous images
might be said to change day to night. Made with large, specially
built pinhole cameras and exposures that can last several days,
they are presented right-side up, but retain the image's natural
negative state. The result is that Ms. Lutter's subjects _ vast
industrial sites that seem abandoned _ are pushed further into a
silvery twilight zone, an eerie past tense that is enhanced by a
resemblance to large daguerrotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the traces of time are visible, most notably in two
images of a zeppelin hangar in Friedrichshafen, Germany, in which a
zeppelin and the machinery around it change position. The show also
includes two images of an empty Nabisco factory in Beacon, N.Y.,
that resembles a prison. Best of all (albeit from a New York bias)
is a close-up of the big Pepsi-Cola sign in Queens, from the Queens
side with the Manhattan skyline visible behind its scaffolding and
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lutter is not the first contemporary photographer to produce
big, well-made images with a pinhole camera, but the combination of
her technical precision and the flat-footed romanticism created by
the reversed image is unusual. Each of her irradiated images seems
to give us a final glimpse of a defunct world just before it went
up in smoke. In the brochure to the exhibition, Lynn Cooke, the Dia
curator who organized it, sums up both Ms. Lutter's and Graham's
images with an unusually romantic quote from Walter Benjamin: ``The
world is beautiful _ that is its watchword.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Double Vision,'' which Ms. Cooke also organized and which
has been up for several months, complex technique supplies a little
too much of the fascination, with the result that the work is
almost more interesting to think about than to look at.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is known for appropriating and manipulating feature films
in ways that frequently stretch time. Previous works include a
24-hour projection of ``Psycho,'' a five-year projection of ``The
Searchers'' and, on opposite walls of the Gagosian Gallery in SoHo
last spring, a double projection of Robert DeNiro's famous
soliloquy as Travis Bickle in ``Taxi Driver'' _ ``Are you talking
to me?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the piece at Dia, which is titled ``Left Is Right and Right
Is Wrong and Left Is Wrong and Right Is Right,'' Gordon has created
another kind of doubleness using the entirety of ``Hypnosis,'' a
little-known 97-minute film noir directed by Otto Preminger. He has
split the film, putting even-numbered frames on one reel,
odd-numbered frames on another and then replacing the excised
frames with black leader. These films are projected side by side on
one wall, with the one on the right reversed (which partly explains
the title).
</P>
<P>
   The result of these manipulations is a hypnotic strobing of
image and sound and an eye-dazzling mirroring that takes full
advantage of the movie's black-and-white film and sharp-edged
stylishness while throwing the camera's every move into high
relief. It is an effect of impressive short-term power, but it is
impossible to spend much time in this gallery (nor is lingering
encouraged, given the absence of benches). Meaning is almost
entirely disrupted; the film becomes a pantomime enacted against
kaleidoscopic patterns and sliding planes.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gordon, Douglas has sometimes worked with existing film,
but in ``Win, Place or Show'' it is the shooting process and the
movie set that he manipulates. The scene, which is projected double
on one wall, is a six-minute exchange of words and then blows
between two men who share a modernistic apartment in a big,
anonymous complex.
</P>
<P>
   Their argument reveals their different backgrounds and
personalities, their shared malaise and their mutual hostility. It
erupts into violence over a discussion of betting on horses,
subsides, and then, seamlessly, the scene begins again. (The whole
effect is rather like a big color photograph by another Canadian
artist, Jeff Wall, come to life.)
</P>
<P>
   The doubling is not at all seamless: the projected images don't
match, but overlap awkwardly; the actors seem to move from one
projection to another. And each repetition of the scene is a little
different. Words and camera angles change; objects come and go; the
fight is sometimes on the floor, sometimes on the bed. Watching it
several times, the viewer becomes increasingly confused, unable to
keep track of the differences and immersed in the film's mechanics,
all the while hoping to catch the cycle beginning again.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is in vain. In fact, the scene has been shot several
times, with different dialogue, props, blocking and multiple camera
angles. The sequence and pairing of the resulting versions are
determined by a computer, and there are about 200,000 possible
combinations. It is virtually impossible to see the same thing
twice, an almost unheard-of situation where film is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The works in ``Double Vision'' offer a variant on the image-text
duality of classic conceptual art: the specific technical feats
involved in making them function as the all-too-necessary
explanation. Still, it is interesting to see the efforts of two
artists in reasonable proximity at Dia; each show is a good match
in which the sum of the parts exceeds the whole.

YIELD ON 30-YEAR BOND IS HIGHEST SINCE OCTOBER 1997 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long-term interest rates jumped to their highest
levels in more than two years Thursday as the persistent strength
of the U.S. economy convinced more and more investors that the
Federal Reserve might have to raise interest rates sharply to rein
in growth.
</P>
<P>
   The view of how hard the nation's central bank will have to push
on the brakes seems to change almost daily. Just a month ago, after
the Fed raised its interest rate target a quarter of a percentage
point, the third increase this year, many analysts thought the Fed
was finished.
</P>
<P>
   But just a few weeks later, the talk was of one more rate
increase, but not until the March meeting of policy-makers. Then
the one rate increase moved up to February. Now the talk is of two
rate increases. And there is even speculation that the Fed might
raise its target for the Federal Funds rate, the overnight loan
rate between banks, by a half-point in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fed policy-makers are going to tighten until they see the
economy slow down,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at
Chase Asset Management. ``And there is no sign the economy is
slowing.''
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond jumped to 6.39 percent
Thursday, from 6.32 percent on Wednesday. That is the highest the
yield has been since October 1997, surpassing the recent high of
6.37 percent in October of this year. The price, which moves in the
opposite direction, fell 27/32, to 96 17/32.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the Treasury's two-year note, which is more
sensitive to threats of higher interest rates from the Fed, rose to
6.13 percent from 6.06 on Wednesday. The narrow gap between the
yields of the 30-year bond and the two-year note is also a sign
that investors expect the Fed to move soon.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Slifer, the chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers, and
Ethan Harris, the senior economist there, are two of many analysts
who have been forced by strong growth to raise their expectations
of Fed rate increases. A month ago they thought the Fed was
through; now they are predicting two Fed rate increases in the
first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they have increased their forecast of
fourth-quarter growth to 5.5 percent from 4.3 percent. And this
week's economic data seems to confirm that judgment. Retail sales
in November jumped 0.9 percent, well above expectations. Industrial
production rose 0.3 percent, which was strong considering the
revision of October's climb to 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report of a record trade deficit in October was also
a worry because the record imports for the month were another sign
of relentless consumer spending. A decline in initial jobless
claims to a 26-year low also showed how hot the economy is.
</P>
<P>
   The force that seems to be driving the consumer is the continued
strength of the stock market, which increases consumers'
willingness to spend. So until the stock market slows down from its
five-year double-digit pace, it will be hard to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman, Sachs, said
Thursday that the stock market would climb at a more moderate pace
next year, in part because the market is fully valued. Her year-end
target for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index is 1,525, a 7.5
percent move from its close Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But to get this kind of performance, Harris said that the Fed
would probably have ``to take a few more warning shots across the
bow of the stock market.''

 &HT;    BellSouth, Qwest join in deals worth more than $250 million
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth's April alliance with Qwest Communications
has thus far produced contracts worth more than $250 million, the
companies announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 27 contracts, like a big-ticket arrangement with the state
of Tennessee, call for the companies to provide high-speed data and
Internet services, as well as voice communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our alliance with Qwest is paying immediate dividends for our
customers and shareholders,'' said F. Duane Ackerman, BellSouth
chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for the two companies to provide a broadband
network serving the state government, the Board of Regents and the
University of Tennessee system.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth paid $3.5 billion for 10 percent of Denver-based
Qwest, which offers high-speed and long-distance services. The deal
with Qwest was hailed as a breakthrough for BellSouth. The company
has no long-distance capabilities outside its nine-state region and
is still legally prevented from offering long-distance within its
turf.
</P>
<P>
   While only a fraction of $24 billion-a-year BellSouth's size,
Qwest has assets that BellSouth lacks. The company has been
building an 18,500-mile national high-speed network. Qwest also
owns the nation's fourth-largest long-distance provider, LCI.
</P>
<P>
   Until BellSouth wins federal approval to enter long-distance,
its interest in a long-distance provider is limited to 10 percent.
In the fall, Qwest outmaneuvered Global Crossing to buy U S West, a
merger that has not been completed. When it is, BellSouth's stake
in Qwest will dip to 3.5 percent and BellSouth could again invest
until it reached the 10 percent ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has predicted an entry into long-distance in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the arrangement with Qwest permits BellSouth to
bid for contracts with large companies and organizations that might
otherwise seek a rival provider for all its telecommunication
needs.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth and Qwest have bid on more than 250 other contracts,
the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The score card on the Qwest alliance comes one week after
BellSouth announced a complex arrangement that will boost its
European holdings. The widely praised deal calls for BellSouth to
eventually trade its interest in a German wireless company for a
much more valuable stake in Dutch-based KPN Telecom. Qwest has a
European joint venture with KPN.

 &HT;    ISRAEL, SYRIA TALKS END WITH AGREEMENT TO RESUME IN JANUARY
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-PEACE-1217.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israeli and Syrian officials wound up two days of
preliminary peace talks Thursday with an agreement to meet again
for a more intensive round of negotiations beginning Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who will help mediate the talks somewhere
near Washington, said the agreement put the two blood enemies on a
path, albeit a rocky one, toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   It also set the table, Clinton said, for a year-long diplomatic
full-court press to end half a century of bloodshed in the
fractious Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``The journey will be tough. Nothing in the past 48 hours should
lead us to believe otherwise,'' Clinton told White House reporters
during a brief statement outside the West Wing. ``But the parties
are embarked on this path. They have agreed there should be no
looking back, for the sake of our generation and generations yet to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton's announcement itself offered evidence of the
difficulties ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on either side of him were Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, the highest
ranking officials from each country ever to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, though, was permitted to speak, an apparent safeguard
against the sort of unanticipated public criticism Sharaa levied
against Israel and its allies at the outset of the sensitive talks
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two men didn't shake hands, either, eschewing diplomatic
custom. Nor did they shake hands in private, according to Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, who spent most of the past two days
meeting with Barak and Sharaa, separately and jointly.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the frosty atmospherics, both men agreed to move forward
on negotiations centered on Israeli return of the strategic Golan
Heights in exchange for an end to hostilities and threats from
Syria and its 400,000-man army to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the core issues that have divided the two neighbors
since Israeli troops seized the Golan territory after Syria
attacked Israel in 1967. The January talks hold out the prospect of
the most concerted effort to date to resolve the 32-year-old
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows that the road is not an easy one,'' Albright
told reporters at a White House news conference. ``All I can tell
you of what we came out from this is an incredible willingness for
everybody to put their shoulder to the wheel and really work. And
we will see.''
</P>
<P>
   To help get the wheel rolling, Albright asked each side to take
steps to help build confidence in the peace process among Israeli
and Syrian people, both deeply distrustful of each other and, at
times, of U.S. intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Sharaa was told, for instance, to use Syria's extensive
influence over anti-Israeli Hezbollah guerillas, many of whom
operate out of southern Syria, to end attacks against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was told to restrain Israeli-backed militia forces in
southern Lebanon, where one such group lobbed mortar shells into a
school on Thursday, injuring 20 youngsters. The group claimed it
was responding to fire from anti-Israeli guerillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important for there to be a de-escalation and
maximum restraint by all sides,'' Albright said, ``to make sure
that the enemies of peace are not able to disrupt anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Syrian peace efforts are part of a larger puzzle
Clinton hopes to piece together before leaving office that also
entails settling Israel's long standing-conflict with the
Palestinians and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Reinvigorating the Israeli-Syrian talks after nearly four years
of stalemate, Clinton said, was essential to moving the larger
peace train down the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are witnessing a new beginning in the effort to achieve a
comprehensive peace in the Middle East,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Syrian-Israeli negotiations off to a good start,
Israeli-Lebanese negotiations expected to begin soon, and the
Palestinian track well underway,'' Clinton said, ``we can truly set
our sights on a new and different Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have commited to
agreeing, by mid-February, to a framework for hammering out their
remaining differences by October on such contentious issues as the
future of Jerusalem and the question of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   While those talks have bogged down in recent weeks over the
issue of Israeli troop withdrawals from the occupied West Bank,
Albright said Barak reiterated here this week his determination to
stick to the time-frame he and Arafat have agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-Lebanon talks are not yet scheduled. The issues there,
though, closely mirror the land-for-peace formulation at the heart
of the Israeli-Syrian negotiations. That, combined with Syria's
dominant influence over Lebanon, lead most analysts to expect that
an Israeli-Lebanon accord could quickly fall into place following
the resolution of the much thornier Israeli-Syrian conflict.

<P>
   Albright said the Israeli-Syrian negotiations would convene next
month in an ``isolated'' location, yet to be determined, near
Washington.

<P>
   She suggested that the talks would follow the model Clinton set
a year ago when he brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations
at the Wye River Plantation in rural Maryland.
</P>

   ``The main kind of needs that we have is that it be close enough
to Washington for the President to be able to come and go, as he
did for Wye,'' Albright said, ``and that the surroundings really be
conducive to hard work, and some informal discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Wye River talks lasted for nine days. Albright said
the administration would set no deadline on the duration of the
Israeli-Syrian round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not putting limits,'' she said. ``We're going to work to
the extent that people are getting serious things done.''

 &HT;    BellSouth, Qwest join in deals worth more than $250 million
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth's April alliance with Qwest Communications
has thus far produced contracts worth more than $250 million, the
companies announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 27 contracts, like a big-ticket arrangement with the state
of Tennessee, call for the companies to provide high-speed data and
Internet services, as well as voice communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our alliance with Qwest is paying immediate dividends for our
customers and shareholders,'' said F. Duane Ackerman, BellSouth
chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for the two companies to provide a broadband
network serving the state government, the Board of Regents and the
University of Tennessee system.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth paid $3.5 billion for 10 percent of Denver-based
Qwest, which offers high-speed and long-distance services. The deal
with Qwest was hailed as a breakthrough for BellSouth. The company
has no long-distance capabilities outside its nine-state region and
is still legally prevented from offering long-distance within its
turf.
</P>
<P>
   While only a fraction of $24 billion-a-year BellSouth's size,
Qwest has assets that BellSouth lacks. The company has been
building an 18,500-mile national high-speed network. Qwest also
owns the nation's fourth-largest long-distance provider, LCI.
</P>
<P>
   Until BellSouth wins federal approval to enter long-distance,
its interest in a long-distance provider is limited to 10 percent.
In the fall, Qwest outmaneuvered Global Crossing to buy U S West, a
merger that has not been completed. When it is, BellSouth's stake
in Qwest will dip to 3.5 percent and BellSouth could again invest
until it reached the 10 percent ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has predicted an entry into long-distance in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the arrangement with Qwest permits BellSouth to
bid for contracts with large companies and organizations that might
otherwise seek a rival provider for all its telecommunication
needs.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth and Qwest have bid on more than 250 other contracts,
the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The score card on the Qwest alliance comes one week after
BellSouth announced a complex arrangement that will boost its
European holdings. The widely praised deal calls for BellSouth to
eventually trade its interest in a German wireless company for a
much more valuable stake in Dutch-based KPN Telecom. Qwest has a
European joint venture with KPN.

   TRUMP-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ Donald Trump builds buildings. I
write about them. So far, he hasn't given me an occasion to write
glowingly about his architectural projects. It would be great if
this changed. I'm not hopeful. But I love the color,
contentiousness and comedy Trump brings to the contemporary urban
scene. Adrian Stokes, the British art critic, once wrote that
``Architecture is limited to forms without events.'' I disagree. As
a social, public and urban art form, architecture can't be
separated from the events that buildings contain, shape and
provoke. Architecture criticism, in written appraisals or the
comments of sidewalk superintendents, qualifies as an event in this
sense. Even when criticism is negative, it is part of the fabric
that holds a great city together. I don't hate Trump's buildings,
but even if that were the case, I would still see them as a
challenge to examine my preferences in relation to his. By Herbert
Muschamp. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   MUSIC-LANGUAGE (subslug) (Undated) _ A musical observer a
century ago could have looked around at a number of living
composers whose works were being regularly performed wherever
Western classical music was known. And most of those composers were
relatively young. We live in a different world. Most of the
composers who are widely admired today are over 50, and some are
over 90. Once John Cage had produced his silent piece ``4' 33'',''
in 1952, there was perhaps nowhere to go but sideways. The only
progress made after that was in electronic music and in the
recovery of large form, whether by erstwhile Serialists, such as
Pierre Boulez, or by the new Minimalists, such as Steve Reich. And
even in these areas, not much has changed in the last 20 years. By
Paul Griffiths. (Moved).

   DOCUMENTARY-FILMS (Berkeley, Calif.) _ The Fantasy building has
been the birthplace of cinematic flights of fancy _ to the Sahara,
to the concert halls of 18th-century Vienna, to the Amazon jungle.
But this seven-story glass and concrete structure, also houses a
different breed of filmmaker. For more than a decade, the film
producer, Saul Zaentz has offered low-cost space to local
documentarians, making his building a center for San Francisco's
growing, well-regarded documentary community. By Edward Wong.

</P>
<P>
   SNOW-ON-CEDARS-FILM (Hollywood) _ ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' is
a complex story that spreads across many years and while it is, at
heart, a love story, it also contains elements of epic historical
importance, like the incarceration of Japanese-Americans in
detention camps during World War II. And there are three main plot
threads, according to Scott Hicks, the film's director. A murder
mystery (the Japanese-American fisherman is accused of murdering a
white fisherman, with whose family he had been embroiled in a
soured land deal), a love story (between Ishmael, a war veteran and
editor of the island's newspaper, and the accused fisherman's wife)
and the story of how the war had affected each of them and their
community. The film opens Wednesday. By Rick Lyman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SHOAH-VIDEO (Undated) _ Time doesn't fly in Claude Lanzmann's
monumental film; it melts. A chronicle of the Holocaust, ``Shoah''
(``annihilation'' in Hebrew) proceeds deliberately, inexorably, for
9 hours and 23 minutes, set always to the click-clack of boxcars
that carried Jews to the gas chambers and crematoriums. Released in
theaters in 1985 and now back on video after seven years out of
distribution, the documentary focuses primarily on the death camps
in the Polish towns of Treblinka and Auschwitz. By Peter M.

   PARSONS-DANCE (New York) _ As the choreographer for ``Times
Square 2000,'' Manhattan's round-the-clock salute to the
millennium, David Parsons is putting the finishing touches on
nearly a dozen new dances by the end of the month. Colleagues say
he has kept his part of the program on track _ despite a trip to
the hospital to be treated for dehydration _ with shrewd planning,
a lively imagination and undisguised pragmatism. The outdoor

   RADIO-CITY-CHRISTMAS (New York) _ Once my critical colleagues
have dispatched themselves to various ceremonies of carols, the
``Messiah'' of the day or the latest ``Christmas Oratorio,'' I
check to see that no one is looking and make a beeline for Radio
City Music Hall. I like the ``Radio City Christmas Spectacular''
because it tells me how the season is progressing. I like a Santa
not afraid to loosen his hips to a boogie beat. The Rockettes make
my heart beat fast. There is in this year's show a dance sequence
of multiplying Santas: so many that by the end they barely fit
onstage. It's comforting to know that there will be enough Kriss
Kringles available for every borough and congressional district in
New York City, with some left over for the immediate suburbs. By

   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRY-MUSIC (Undated) _ Country music almost by definition
exists in a convoluted, almost duplicitous relationship with its
past. Inherently reactionary _ that's the whole point _ country on
the surface is all about roots, constancy, shared references both
in terms of the music and the lyrics. But, from its beginnings as a
commercial force country has always been an intensely marketed
amalagm of old and new, real and contrived that was willed into
existence in the 1920s by the modernizing influences of radio, new
recording technology and urbanism. By Peter Applebome. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ART-DECO-ANTIQUES (New York) _ As stocks soared this year, the
New York market for antiques, collectibles and 20th century objects
eclipsed even the levels reached in the boom years of the 1980s.
Auctions, fairs and exhibitions at museums and galleries attracted
new collectors and dealers as well as a new art fair to Manhattan,
heightening the awareness of the decorative arts, especially in the
Art Deco style. By Rita Reif. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   AIRPORT-ARCHITECT (Paris) _ Having designed 30 airport terminals
around the world, Paul Andreu can hardly escape being known as an
airport architect. Not that there is anything amiss with that.
Airports today are what railroad stations were at the turn of the
century, gateways that every year provide tens of millions of
travelers with their first and last impressions of a city. And if
Andreu keeps being invited to build airports, it is because this
engineer-turned-architect enjoys a worldwide reputation for
designing visually striking and passenger-friendly terminals. By
Alan Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TOMASELLI-ART (New York) _ The painter, Fred Tomaselli, uses
cutout photos of birds, flowers, insects and pictures of lips and
eyeballs clipped from fashion magazines as materials for his
collages, which are sealed in several coats of resin. Pictorially
the work veers between the figurative and the abstract, but the
result is usually the same: eye-popping imagery that is dense,
decorative and witty. The latest and largest example, ``Gravity's
Rainbow (Large),'' is now on view at the Whitney Museum of Art at
Philip Morris on 42nd Street through Jan. 7. By William Harris.

<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-AMERICAN-DAUGHTER (Los Angeles) _ The scene is a brunch in an
elegant living room in Georgetown, the upper-class Washington
enclave. Christine Lahti and a half-dozen actresses and actors are
filming ``An American Daughter'' in a home in the upscale Hancock
Park section of Los Angeles. Washington _ the town's hypocrisies,
its self-important journalists and snarky politics _ serves not
only as the setting for the Wendy Wasserstein
comedy-drama-turned-television-movie but the catalyst for the
unique personal and professional pitfalls that face women in and
around government. The drama, which explores the corrosive effects
of a private life turned public before the television cameras, is
now completing production in Los Angeles, and is set to be shown
next spring over Lifetime. By Bernard Weinraub. (Moved).

EGYPT ENVOY SEES ACCORD WITH US ON FLIGHT 990 PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The United States and Egyptian governments are not at
odds but have worked with ``absolutely amazing cooperation'' to
determine what caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, the
Egyptian ambassador to the United States, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Nabil Fahmy would not discuss possible causes of the
Oct. 31 crash off Nantucket, including media speculation that an
Egyptian pilot sent the jetliner into its dive into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with Globe reporters and editors, Fahmy said he is
hopeful that a cause can be determined, but cautioned it could take
a long time.
</P>
<P>
   He implied that much more work is needed to determine if a
mechanical problem or weather brought down the Cairo-bound Boeing
767, which took off from New York's John F. Kennedy International
Airport and went into the steep controlled dive 30 minutes later.
All 217 people aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board has said investigators
have uncovered no sign of mechanical, weather or air traffic
control related problem that could have caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, salvage work is continuing with the Smit Pioneer,
a privately contracted ship, using a crane to haul up human remains
and aircraft parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can reach the point where it is not weather and not
mechanical, at that point we will still not be able to say if there
is evidence of a criminal act or not,'' said Fahmy, who became
ambassador to the US in October and was the individual who
requested the NTSB conduct an investigation into the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Fahmy, who has listened to the cockpit voice recorder tape, said
he was disappointed by leaks that resulted in incorrect and
incomplete information fueling faulty analyses of the crash.
Because of that, he said he would not comment on the tape or any
details of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was been good cooperation between the two
governments. ``This is not an Egyptian-American issue, it is a
human tragedy. . .there has been absolutely amazing cooperation and
no one has seen that or reported it. What we have seen is the
negative implications from leaks by officials.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe has reported that officials familiar with the
investigation believe that co-pilot Gamil El Batouty may have
intentionally disconnected the plane's autopilot, and sent the
plane into its death dive when he was alone in the cockpit. When
Captain Ahmed El Habashi returned to the cockpit there is an
indication the two struggled over control of the plane, before the
engines were turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators want to recover the section below the cockpit to
determine if the metal rod connecting the control columns of the
pilot and co-pilot was sheared off, which would bolster the theory
that the two men battled for the lives of everyone on board. It
takes 50 pounds of pressure to shear the connecting rod.
</P>
<P>
   Fahmy said it will take ``evidence to convince both sides'' and
finding critical parts of the plane could provide ``evidence to
make an objective determination'' of the likely cause. Fahmy said
he did not have the technical knowledge to discuss how much of the
plane, if any, should be reconstructed as part of the investigative
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it was an Egyptian plane, we have a vested interest in
knowing the truth. Because there were Americans on board, the US
has a vested interest,'' he said. ``No one will hide the truth.''

 &HT;    ISRAEL, SYRIA TALKS END WITH AGREEMENT TO RESUME IN JANUARY
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-PEACE-1217.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israeli and Syrian officials wound up two days of
preliminary peace talks Thursday with an agreement to meet again
for a more intensive round of negotiations beginning Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who will help mediate the talks somewhere
near Washington, said the agreement put the two blood enemies on a
path, albeit a rocky one, toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   It also set the table, Clinton said, for a year-long diplomatic
full-court press to end half a century of bloodshed in the
fractious Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``The journey will be tough. Nothing in the past 48 hours should
lead us to believe otherwise,'' Clinton told White House reporters
during a brief statement outside the West Wing. ``But the parties
are embarked on this path. They have agreed there should be no
looking back, for the sake of our generation and generations yet to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton's announcement itself offered evidence of the
difficulties ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on either side of him were Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, the highest
ranking officials from each country ever to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, though, was permitted to speak, an apparent safeguard
against the sort of unanticipated public criticism Sharaa levied
against Israel and its allies at the outset of the sensitive talks
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two men didn't shake hands, either, eschewing diplomatic
custom. Nor did they shake hands in private, according to Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, who spent most of the past two days
meeting with Barak and Sharaa, separately and jointly.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the frosty atmospherics, both men agreed to move forward
on negotiations centered on Israeli return of the strategic Golan
Heights in exchange for an end to hostilities and threats from
Syria and its 400,000-man army to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the core issues that have divided the two neighbors
since Israeli troops seized the Golan territory after Syria
attacked Israel in 1967. The January talks hold out the prospect of
the most concerted effort to date to resolve the 32-year-old
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows that the road is not an easy one,'' Albright
told reporters at a White House news conference. ``All I can tell
you of what we came out from this is an incredible willingness for
everybody to put their shoulder to the wheel and really work. And
we will see.''
</P>
<P>
   To help get the wheel rolling, Albright asked each side to take
steps to help build confidence in the peace process among Israeli
and Syrian people, both deeply distrustful of each other and, at
times, of U.S. intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Sharaa was told, for instance, to use Syria's extensive
influence over anti-Israeli Hezbollah guerillas, many of whom
operate out of southern Syria, to end attacks against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was told to restrain Israeli-backed militia forces in
southern Lebanon, where one such group lobbed mortar shells into a
school on Thursday, injuring 20 youngsters. The group claimed it
was responding to fire from anti-Israeli guerillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important for there to be a de-escalation and
maximum restraint by all sides,'' Albright said, ``to make sure
that the enemies of peace are not able to disrupt anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Syrian peace efforts are part of a larger puzzle
Clinton hopes to piece together before leaving office that also
entails settling Israel's long standing-conflict with the
Palestinians and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Reinvigorating the Israeli-Syrian talks after nearly four years
of stalemate, Clinton said, was essential to moving the larger
peace train down the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are witnessing a new beginning in the effort to achieve a
comprehensive peace in the Middle East,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Syrian-Israeli negotiations off to a good start,
Israeli-Lebanese negotiations expected to begin soon, and the
Palestinian track well underway,'' Clinton said, ``we can truly set
our sights on a new and different Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have commited to
agreeing, by mid-February, to a framework for hammering out their
remaining differences by October on such contentious issues as the
future of Jerusalem and the question of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   While those talks have bogged down in recent weeks over the
issue of Israeli troop withdrawals from the occupied West Bank,
Albright said Barak reiterated here this week his determination to
stick to the time-frame he and Arafat have agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-Lebanon talks are not yet scheduled. The issues there,
though, closely mirror the land-for-peace formulation at the heart
of the Israeli-Syrian negotiations. That, combined with Syria's
dominant influence over Lebanon, lead most analysts to expect that
an Israeli-Lebanon accord could quickly fall into place following
the resolution of the much thornier Israeli-Syrian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the Israeli-Syrian negotiations would convene next
month in an ``isolated'' location, yet to be determined, near
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that the talks would follow the model Clinton set
a year ago when he brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations
at the Wye River Plantation in rural Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main kind of needs that we have is that it be close enough
to Washington for the President to be able to come and go, as he
did for Wye,'' Albright said, ``and that the surroundings really be
conducive to hard work, and some informal discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Wye River talks lasted for nine days. Albright said
the administration would set no deadline on the duration of the
Israeli-Syrian round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not putting limits,'' she said. ``We're going to work to
the extent that people are getting serious things done.''

<P>
   PARIS _ Among allies, France has had for 50 years a unique
capacity to annoy Americans who may love French fries, French wine
_ and sometimes even the French themselves, at least in those rare
moments when they stop their constant hammering.
</P>
<P>
   Irritation at the French is running high now in Washington, so
President Jacques Chirac and other French officials are putting out
the word that it is time to apply a little Gallic charm to their
sensitive American friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not feel in any way irritated or annoyed at the United
States,'' Chirac said in a relaxed interview in French in the
Elysee Palace, a stone's throw from where the American ambassador
lives.
</P>
<P>
   But Chirac, 67 and in his fifth year as president, spoke out
critically on subjects ranging from the Senate's recent rejection
of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, to the failure of
global trade talks in Seattle early this month, to plans for a new
European armed force early in the new century, which in his view
will by no means be an American century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes read that France wants a multipolar world so as to
take the United States down a notch, or create rivalries to
American power,'' he said. ``I talk about a multipolar world
because I think it's inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   China, India, Europe (as Chirac believes) and Russia (according
to Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine) will all be great powers in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   French criticism of American ebullience may seem as relentless
as Cartesian logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are moments when Americans get exasperated and think all
we're trying to do is create difficulties for them,'' Vedrine told
a group of American journalists here the other day, and those
moments have sometimes stretched on endlessly since the days of de
Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing irritates the French more than being dismissed as cranks
rather than accepted as helpful critics. Chirac in particular bends
over backward to assure Americans of his friendly predisposition,
proudly telling visitors that he has credentials as a soda jerk
from Howard Johnson from a student summer in Cambridge, Mass., and
has scores of American friends he considers family. So he feels
entitled to offer a little constructive criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been, of course, an observer of Congress for quite some
time,'' he said. ``To be perfectly frank, there used to be
prominent people you could telephone, ask about things, discuss,
consult, have a dialog with. Today it's more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, he observed, Congress did not seem as open to the
world as it once was _ ``Not the best attitude, given the
responsibilities the United States has in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly critical of this fall's Senate rejection of
the test ban treaty, a vote that threatens, in his words, ``to set
a bad example and start the arms proliferation race again.''
</P>
<P>
   A decision next year by the Clinton administration to build a
limited anti-missile defense against intercontinental rockets
launched by small states like North Korea, Iran or Iraq would
create more global strategic instability than it would eliminate,
Chirac believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at world history,'' he said, ``ever since men
began waging war, you will see that there's a permanent race
between sword and shield. The sword always wins. The more
improvements that are made to the shield, the more improvements are
made to the sword. We think that with these systems,'' he said,
referring to the possible United States anti-missile shield, ``we
are just going to spur swordmakers to intensify their efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``China, which was already working harder than we realized on
both nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles for them, would of
course be encouraged to intensify those efforts, and it has the
resources to do so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``India would be encouraged to do the same thing, and it, too,
has the resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it would also increase tensions within NATO, which would
be too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat from North Korean missiles is sometimes mentioned
as well,'' Chirac said. ``Quite honestly, it isn't persuasive, but
I'm ready to talk about it. I could be wrong, but I'm not the only
one who thinks this way. But these are such important subjects that
they ought to be discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   American criticisms of the rapid deployment force Europe plans
to build for itself by 2003 as an attempt to torpedo the NATO
alliance, Chirac said, just about caused him to fall off his chair.
``The Americans kept saying Europe had to do more for its own
defense, so we finally said, all right, we will,'' he said. ``Now
you shouldn't criticize us for doing what you wanted us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   American ambassadors in European capitals made coordinated
approaches before the Europeans agreed on the details in Helsinki
earlier this month, asking in no uncertain terms for close
coordination with NATO and assurances that the European force would
strengthen the alliance and not weaken it, according to French and
American officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has to make a choice,'' Vedrine said. ``They
have always been for sharing the burden. They've never been much
for sharing the decision-making. Obviously, there are some real
questions we have to answer, such as how are we going to organize
this so as not to interfere with the Alliance. We are well aware
that it's complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac was even more reassuring. ``Very soon the Americans will
understand that this is not going to cause them any problem,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, it was not the French but Tony Blair, the
British prime minister, who at a European summit in Austria in late
October, 1998 first suggested a European armed force that could
intervene in crisis situations where the United States did not want
to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Britain and France, followed by other European allies,
formally proposed one, and all 15 European Union leaders endorsed a
60,000-strong force in Helsinki last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any feeling that President Clinton was upset by
it,'' Chirac said. ``If there was going to be a real problem, Tony
Blair would never have suggested it in the first place,'' Chirac
added. ``All this strengthens NATO, it doesn't in the least mean
any diminution of our commitment to the alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac said he would not use Vedrine's word, ``hyperpower,'' to
describe the unique economic, military, and technological power of
the United States, perhaps because he knew it sent American
officials into overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chirac, a Gaullist conservative whose current term runs
out in 2002, said he understood the foreign minister, a Socialist
who came into office in 1997 when Chirac called a parliamentary
election he mistakenly thought the conservatives were going to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``In French, `hyper' is a word kids like to use,'' like
``super,'' Chirac explained. ``When Vedrine said that America was a
hyperpower there was nothing pejorative about it.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   He said, though, that the awkward power-sharing arrangement of
the past two years between his Gaullists and Vedrine's Socialists
had actually given France an advantage in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really do speak with one voice,'' he said. ``At
international gatherings I'm probably the only one who can truly
say that he speaks in the name of all of his country's people.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac and the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, along
with the rest of the European Union, have said ``no'' to imports of
American beef treated with hormones, despite American assurances
that it was safe. The World Trade Organization authorized the
United States earlier this year to retaliate by imposing high
tariffs on European delicacies and luxury goods to retaliate
against the beef ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been through some big traumas in France, in particular
with blood contaminated with the AIDS virus,'' Chirac said, ``so
you have to understand that these things are highly sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people died in France after contracting AIDS in the
mid-1980s from transfusions of blood. Some French health officials
were later convicted of allowing the blood to be used even though
they knew it might not be free of the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are five or six hormones in hormone-treated beef, and of
those, one is officially recognized by the highest scientific
authorities as being carcinogenic,'' Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have disputed such assertions, but, Chirac
said, ``You can't make us eat something we don't want to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for British beef, which France is refusing to
import any even though the European Union recently decided that it
was now free of ``mad cow disease,'' a neurological disorder in
cattle that may be communicable to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac has called for an international world scientific body to
resolve such disputes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac and other officials say they are not trying to cause
trouble for their powerful ally across the sea. Both Chirac and
Vedrine, for example, both charitably refrained from describing the
collapse of the trade talks in Seattle early this month as an
American failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an American failure, not a European failure, not a
failure of the developing countries,'' Chirac said. ``It will work
out next time.''

INTEL TO INVEST $800 MILLION IN BAY STATE CHIP PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intel Corp. said Thursday it will spend $800 million over the
next two years to overhaul its chip plant in Hudson, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The upgrade will mean an additional 450 jobs at the factory,
which already employs about 1,200 workers. The move also indicates
that the world's largest chip maker is making a long-term
commitment to manufacturing processors at a Bay State plant once
owned by a bitter rival.
</P>
<P>
   Intel acquired the Hudson chip plant, or ``fab,'' as part of a
deal with Digital Equipment Corp. to settle a legal dispute between
the two firms. Digital was later acquired by Houston-based Compaq
Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Digital had built the Hudson plant to manufacture its advanced
Alpha microprocessor chips. As part of the settlement, Intel
continues to make Alpha chips at the fab under contract to Compaq,
which now owns the Alpha design. Another part of the settlement
gave Intel ownership of StrongARM, a Digital chip designed for use
in lightweight, low-powered devices such as palm-sized computers
and cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Digital had never used the Hudson fab to its full capacity, and
neither has Intel, up to now. And by today's standards, the chip
making processes at the Hudson plant are nearly obsolete. ``It's
still running basically the same . . . process technology that it
was when they got it from Digital,'' said Linley Gwennap, editorial
director of Microprocessor Report, a leading industry journal.
``It's way old.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel's commitment to upgrade the plant is related to the
company's new plan to become a leading maker of chips for computer
networking devices. Earlier this year, Intel acquired Level One, a
California firm that uses StrongARM-based processors designed to
control networking devices, such as routers that direct information
to various points of the Internet. Intel will now offer such a
processor, and build it at the Hudson fab, along with other
StrongARM processors and a variety of networking chips.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Intel will add new chip making technologies to
the Hudson plant, to make it consistent with the company's other
chip factories. ``The fab will essentially be 100 percent an Intel
process,'' said Ann Hurd, a spokeswoman for the Santa Clara, Calif.
company.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the cost of the overhaul will be defrayed by tax breaks
from the Massachusetts Office of Business Development and the city
of Hudson. The town agreed to a tax-increment financing deal that
will limit increases in Intel's property tax assessment. For its
part, the state is providing a 5 percent investment tax credit over
the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It signals that Massachusetts welcomes these large
investments,'' said state business development director Dean Serpa.
``It dispels the perception that Massachusetts is a high-tax state
for developers.''
</P>
<P>
   Work on the fab will begin next month and should be completed in
2002. Little construction on the building will be needed. Indeed,
much of the project will involve the purchase and installation of
the complex machines used to make microchips. These machines cost
between $1 million and $3 million each, must be ordered months in
advance, and must undergo a complex cleaning process before being
installed in the ultraclean rooms where the chips are made.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's stock rose 1 5/16, to 80 1/4, in trading on the Nasdaq
Stock Market.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Opera has long been saddled with the perception that
it is a pricey art form for elitist audiences. This is not quite
fair. After all, decent seats for a Knicks game at Madison Square
Garden are comparably expensive, and more difficult to obtain than
decent seats for the opera.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to make the elitism charge stick when for 60 years
the Saturday matinees of the Metropolitan Opera have been broadcast
live across the United States and Canada, sponsored by Texaco.
``The Texaco-Metropolitan Opera International Radio Broadcasts,''
as the series is officially called, represents the longest
continuous commercial sponsorship in broadcast history. (Met
performances were first heard on radio nine years earlier.) The
broadcasts have also been carried live in Europe since 1990.
Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong were added later, and this
year the network was extended to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's broadcast, beginning at 12:30 p.m., offers the new
Met production of Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde'' with the latest
contenders to the daunting title roles, the tenor Ben Heppner and
the soprano Jane Eaglen. James Levine conducts. As usual, the
performance will be carried complete (meaning, in this case, more
than five hours) and without commercial interruption, although the
Texaco name is repeatedly tucked into the commentary.
</P>
<P>
   The first intermission feature offers a Singers' Roundtable with
two sopranos, Birgit Nilsson, a great Met Isolde of the past, and
the beloved Eileen Farrell, in conversation with the conductor and
critic Will Crutchfield. The second intermission will be, of
course, the Texaco Opera Quiz, a popular component of the
broadcasts since it first appeared in 1940 as Opera Question Forum.
Thousands of listeners send in questions every year, hoping to
stump the panel and, especially, to provoke some informative and
amusing banter, which is the real purpose of the quiz.
</P>
<P>
   When the current radio season ends on April 22 with Wagner's
``Gotterdammerung,'' Texaco will have sponsored the broadcasts of
1,192 live performances of 142 operas. It is estimated that 10
million listeners tune in each season. What other art form has been
made so available to so many people for so long?
</P>
<P>
   Betty Allen, a former mezzo-soprano who is now president emerita
of the Harlem School of the Arts, first listened to the broadcasts
as a girl in Campbell, Ohio, a suburb of Youngstown. Hers was one
of the few black families in the working-class neighborhood. ``The
families on my street were mostly Sicilian and Greek,'' she said.
``On Saturday, walking down the street, you could hear the Met
broadcasts coming from the windows of everybody's house. No one
told them that opera and the arts were not for them, not for poor
people, just for rich snobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The composer John Harbison, whose opera ``The Great Gatsby''
will receive its world premiere at the Met on Monday night, was
reared in a cultured household: His father was a history professor
at Princeton University and an amateur musician. Harbison needed
little encouragement to listen to the Met broadcasts, which he
started doing faithfully when he was 8.
</P>
<P>
   He even subscribed to Opera News, the magazine of the
Metropolitan Opera Guild, which offers guides to the broadcasts. He
was mortified when one day during intermission the announcer cited
``Little Johnny Harbison,'' then 9, as ``the youngest official
member of the guild.'' Now, more than 50 years later, Harbison's
new opera will be broadcast on the afternoon of Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Countless other musicians, singers and opera buffs, especially
those who grew up in regions of the country not convenient to
professional opera companies, have emphasized the importance of
listening to the broadcasts as youngsters. In a new biography of
the tenor Jon Vickers, Jeannie Williams reports that young Jon and
his siblings usually spent Saturday afternoons at home in Prince
Albert, Ontario, scrubbing and polishing the floors under the
watchful eye of their mother, a fastidious housekeeper. As they
worked, they listened to the Met broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   This was in the late 1930s, before Texaco's sponsorship began.
One broadcast in particular was unforgettable to Vickers: On Feb.
26, 1938, the tenor Giovanni Martinelli, who was singing Radames in
Verdi's ``Aida,'' collapsed halfway through the ``Celeste Aida''
aria and had to be replaced with Frederick Jagel. As he mopped the
floors that season, Ms. Williams relates, Vickers would have heard
Lauritz Melchior as Siegmund and Parsifal and Martinelli as Otello,
roles that would become central to his own career.
</P>
<P>
   My childhood experience with the broadcasts was fairly typical
for an American baby-boomer. My parents, though not at all musical,
encouraged me to study piano and gave me spending money for
classical records. I found my own way to the Met broadcasts.
Sometimes, in a sort of role reversal, I would listen on the
crackly kitchen radio and try to interest my mother. More often
than not I took my portable radio into the hallway, where the
reception was best, and listened alone.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I loved hearing the plot summaries read by the avuncular Milton
Cross, the announcer for more than 40 years, until his death in
1975, when Peter Allen took over. The stories were too convoluted
to follow, and I essentially had no idea what the operas were
about. I didn't care. The singing hooked me. Hearing the ovations
and bravos of the audience was almost my favorite part. It made me
want to understand why everyone got so excited.
</P>
<P>
   The first Met broadcast was of Humperdinck's ``Hansel and
Gretel'' on Christmas Day 1931. It was instigated not by the opera
company's desire to spread the gospel but by its financial
troubles. The Depression had brought the Met's first budget
deficits, the company archivist Robert Tuggle reports. So when NBC
offered $120,000 for the right to broadcast the season in 1931, the
Met jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hansel'' was the only complete opera on the air that season.
The other broadcasts offered excerpts from the performances. But
the listeners' response was so enthusiastic that complete opera
broadcasts began the next season. At first there was a changing
roster of sponsors. During the 1938-39 and 1939-40 seasons, there
were no sponsors at all. Extinction seemed imminent.
</P>
<P>
   James Kinnear, formerly the president and chief executive of
Texaco and now the Met's board chairman, said the oil company was
well positioned to come to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texaco was the only company that since 1928 was doing business
in all 48 states,'' he said recently. ``So when this opportunity
was brought to the chairman at the time, W.S.S. Rodgers, he felt
that as a truly national marketer, Texaco was the ideal sponsor for
these nationwide broadcasts.''
</P>
<P>
   That first Texaco broadcast came on Dec. 7, 1940, a performance
of Mozart's ``Nozze di Figaro'' with Licia Albanese, Elisabeth
Rethberg, Ezio Pinza, Salvatore Baccaloni and other great singers,
conducted by Ettore Panizza.
</P>
<P>
   Given the shifts of direction and changes of leadership that
routinely occur in major corporations, the longevity of Texaco's
commitment is striking. Kinnear said that in his 45 years with the
company he never once heard serious discussion of eliminating the
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about hard-sell product advertising,'' he said.
``This does much good for the company's corporate image and much
good for listeners. I can't remember a single annual meeting with
shareholders, who often show up ready to give you a hard time, when
somebody didn't say, `Thank you for the Texaco opera,' and then
everyone would stand and applaud.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bijur, Texaco's current chairman and chief executive, said
the company's total support of the Met over the years was
approaching $200 million, which includes, in addition to the
Saturday radio broadcasts, the lead sponsorship of about 80
television broadcasts on PBS since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sponsoring the Met has become part of our corporate DNA,'' he
said. ``It creates tremendous goodwill for us. You should see the
letters we get thanking us.'' Thousands arrive each year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Various stations in the network have not been so steadfast in
their commitment. Some managers grumble about having to set aside
some 20 Saturday afternoons each season for opera. The most recent
dropout was WCRB-FM in the Boston suburb of Waltham, the largest
commercial classical music station in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Campbell, the chief executive of Charles River
Broadcasting, the station's parent company, decided to drop the
broadcasts, citing the rigidity of the format (he wanted to use his
own announcers, for example) and the loss in potential revenue from
commercials. Texaco negotiates a fee it pays to each station for
broadcasting the series.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell received ``hate mail and threatening letters'' from
devoted opera fans, he said recently. WHRB, the scrappy, committed
student station at Harvard University, stepped into the void,
although its lower wattage will leave some patches of the region
unserved. The Met's network of 325 commercial and noncommercial
stations reaches about 95 percent of the population in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell revealed his hand when he was quoted as saying in a
recent article in The New York Times that opera was a hard sell for
many radio listeners. ``The popular operas are fine,'' he said,
``like `La Traviata' and `La Boheme.''' But ``then along comes a
five-hour Wagner feature, and I've got to tell you, that is an
acquired taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, listeners will never acquire the taste if they don't
get a chance to hear those five-hour Wagner operas, like the one
scheduled for Saturday. The radio legacy of ``Tristan und Isolde''
alone is illustrious. From 1932 to 1950, Melchior sang 20 radio
performances as Tristan, the most by one singer in a single role.
</P>
<P>
   The Met has long planned its schedule so that radio audiences
can hear as much of a season's offerings as possible. The staples
have come regularly. But so have unusual works like Verdi's
``Stiffelio,'' Poulenc's ``Mamelles des Tiresias,'' Schoenberg's
``Erwartung'' and ``Moses und Aron,'' and Barber's ``Vanessa.''
</P>
<P>
   Audience surveys as well as mail suggest that listeners love the
intermission features. Everyone has a favorite recollection. I
remember _ I must have been about 12 _ being entranced as the
conductor and opera expert Boris Goldovsky traced the use of the
``Scarpia chords'' in Puccini's ``Tosca'' in one of his inimitable
lectures from the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the legendary Singers' Roundtable in 1970 with
Dame Joan Sutherland, Marilyn Horne and Martina Arroyo. At one
point the question posed was: Are there any roles that would have
suited you vocally but that you chose not to sing for other
reasons? Ms. Arroyo, who was not a small woman, answered, in one of
the great Freudian slips of all time, ``Yes, Madama Butterball.''
</P>
<P>
   The roundtable almost came to a complete halt because Ms. Horne
could not stop laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The actor Tony Randall, an informed opera buff, made his debut
as a panelist on the Opera Quiz in 1967. Appearing shortly
afterward on the ``Tonight'' show, he told Johnny Carson that he
was used to being stopped on the street in New York now and then by
well-wishers, but that such encounters had increased after his
debut on the Met broadcasts. Everywhere he went, it seemed, people
were shouting at him, ``You were great on the Opera Quiz!''
</P>
<P>
   Carson, seeming a bit nonplussed, admitted that he had never
heard of it. So the Met broadcasts may not be reaching everyone.
But they are hardly elitist.

   JERUSALEM _ At least 15 Lebanese schoolchildren were reported
wounded Thursday, some seriously, when Israeli-allied militia
forces fired rockets at a village Israel says is a base for
Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   In an indirect acknowledgement of responsibility, the Israel
Defense Forces called the attack ``a mistake'' and said it
``expresses regret at the injuries to civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the children were wounded while playing in the
schoolyard in the village of Arab Salim, while others were hit
inside the school building, according to teachers and other
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sitting in the classroom, and all of a sudden a shell
landed,'' said one young girl interviewed in a television report
from the southern Lebanese village Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's talks with Syrian peace negotiators in
Washington, Israeli state television reported, Israeli officials
voiced distress at what they said was the accidental shelling of
the primary school by militia fighters of the South Lebanon Army.
Though nominally autonomous, the Israeli-equipped South Lebanon
Army fights in tandem with Israeli troops in the southern Lebanese
border zone that Israel has occupied since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   David Levy, Israel's foreign minister, told an Israeli
television interviewer in Washington that the Syrians were
concerned about an escalation of the southern Lebanon conflict.
``It is clear to them that if the fighting continues in Lebanon, it
will damage everything that we are doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut, Lebanon's president, Emile Lahoud, issued a statement
saying he ``condemns the crime and places the responsibility for it
on Israel and those who are collaborating with Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The village of Arab Salim is north of the Israeli-controlled
border zone in an area partly controlled by the insurgent
Hezbollah, or Party of God, which has been backed in the past by
both Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Ephraim Sneh, Israel's deputy defense minister, put the blame
for Thursday's incident on Hezbollah, which he said has been
staging artillery attacks from residential areas. ``When we react,
something like this is likely to occur, sad though it may be,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army said in its brief official statement that the
South Lebanon Army had returned artillery fire ``toward the source
of terrorist fire'' near the village of Arab Selim, and had
unintentionally hit populated areas. ``Firing from populated areas
endangers residents, as it requires a response against the source
of the fire,'' the statement said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The army did not provide its own information about the
casualties and made no specific mention of the schoolchildren. Its
statement did say, however, that three local Lebanese women had
been wounded recently by Hezbollah artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing retaliation for the school shelling, residents of
Israeli border areas prepared Thursday for a possible evacuation to
bomb shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and South Lebanon Army forces have had intensive
firefights with Hezbollah units for the last two days, an
escalation that some commentators here interpreted as a signal that
Hezbollah is no longer beholden to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has said it plans to withdraw from southern Lebanon next
year, either unilaterally or through a negotiated agreement with
Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, who is concluding
his first round of peace talks with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel in Washington Thursday, plans to stop in Beirut on his way
back to Damascus to discuss the negotiations with Lebanese
officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To paraphrase Jean-Luc Godard, who once suggested
that the most effective way to criticize a film is to make another,
I propose that the best way to criticize ``Marie Christine'' is to
see it back to back with another ambitious but very different
theater piece, ``In the Blood.'' Which is what I did recently, by
accident and with no malice aforethought.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't fair. Nobody ever intended that the two productions
should be seen in tandem and then compared. Yet when they are, each
has a way of illuminating the other, sometimes happily, other times
for merciless effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marie Christine'' is Michael John LaChiusa's new operalike
musical in the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center. It is a
variation on the ``Medea'' of Euripides, updated by almost 2,500
years and transferred, bag and baggage, from the Corinth of
prehistory to the New Orleans and Chicago of the 1890s.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Blood,'' which was inspired in part by Nathaniel
Hawthorne's ``Scarlet Letter,''is Suzan-Lori Parks' nonmusical
play, a spare, utterly contemporary contemplation of an unwed
welfare mother of five and the urban society that successfully
ignores her. Unfortunately for many of you, ``In the Blood'' gives
its final performance Sunday in the Shiva Theater at the Joseph
Papp Public Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Each production is headed by a stunning young actress (Audra
McDonald in ``Marie Christine'' and Charlayne Woodard in ``In the
Blood'') and shares an unusual seriousness in its aspirations. Yet
``Marie Christine'' is so intimidating with its artistic
earnestness that you might want to cry uncle before the end of the
first act. ``In the Blood'' has the jazzy beat and cheeky humor of
life as it's captured in tabloid prose. Yet ``In the Blood''
prompts exultation, which is what opera is supposed to do, while
``Marie Christine'' leaves you simply exhausted and a little
confused.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing ``Marie Christine'' and ``In the Blood'' in such
juxtaposition confirms suspicions that if and when a new musical
form is ever identified, it may be too narrowly elitist for
Broadway, which seems to be prospering anyway with a succession of
revivals. At the same time, there is hope for an Off Broadway and a
regional theater that, like the plays of Ms. Parks, speaks to the
needs of the people without condescension.
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa, who wrote the words and music for ``Marie Christine,''
continues his tireless pursuit of a new American musical idiom,
having already won attention for his satirical ``First Lady Suite''
and ``Hello Again,'' an adaptation of Schnitzler's ``Ronde.'' This
season LaChiusa is being represented not only by ``Marie
Christine,'' for which Lincoln Center Theater has provided a
sumptuous production, but also by ``The Wild Party,'' the musical
he is doing with George C. Wolfe, the producer of the Public
Theater. It is scheduled to open in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa is the fellow everyone wants to quote when doing a
``whither'' piece on the state of musical theater. There were high
hopes for ``Marie Christine,'' which opened at Lincoln Center not
long after ``Contact.'' This innovative, elegantly funny dance
play, conceived by the choreographer Susan Stroman and the writer
John Weidman, which is now at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater, moves to
the Beaumont in March.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind ``Marie Christine'' is an interesting one. The
New Orleans of 100 years ago is a place where whites and blacks
recognize a singular, completely artificial racial hierarchy of a
complexity that is both primitive and highly sophisticated. There
are apartheidlike laws on the books, but also ways in which the
races mix freely, intimately, if not publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The system, which ignores have-nots without regard for race or
color, perfectly serves the power structures of the white, the
black and the mixed-race communities.
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa's Medea is Marie Christine, the daughter of a black
mother who has a penchant for voodoo, and a rich white plantation
owner. She, too, dabbles in magic, which she explains initially as
little more than mind games. Later, though, she demonstrates that
her magic is as powerful and terrifying as Medea's.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Christine has been brought up in a genteel, strictly
bourgeois mulatto world as far removed from the ruling white
society as it is from the black working class. Like Medea, she is
initially regarded as something exotic and richly desirable by the
man who destroys her. In this case, he is Dante Keyes, a handsome
buccaneer who seduces her and carries her away, first to New York
and then to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   When Dante eventually dumps her to further his career in Chicago
politics, she does what every Medea has been doing since time
began; that is, she wreaks a terrible revenge on Dante's new wife
and protects her sons in the fashion dictated by the ferocity of
her nature.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ``Marie Christine'' as an opera or as a musical
_ it is not easily classified as either _ is that LaChiusa's music
and words never successfully embrace the primal narrative. They
never reveal and embody the all-consuming passions that rule this
Medea. Instead, the music and words rather dutifully announce and
describe feelings and events that are beyond the artist's ability
to evoke directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Blood'' deals with a world no less exotic in its way
than that of ``Marie Christine,'' but never for a minute does it
seem to be unreal or removed. Ms. Parks' reimagined Hester Prynne
is a woman we choose not to see every day as we move around the
city.
</P>
<P>
   This Hester is a timeless figure. She is a bewildered Everywoman
living under a Manhattan bridge, coping with her five kids: Jabber,
Bully, Trouble, Beauty and Baby. She uses and is used by welfare
people, do-gooders, fellow drifters and the deadbeat fathers of her
children. She is rude, deceitful, filthy, in short: impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodard's performance is blunt, beautiful and riveting, so
full of uncanny force that it can make you feel guilty for
watching, guiltier for laughing. I can't say that if I met her on
the street, I wouldn't walk by her feeling a bit of righteous
indignation that we were sharing _ even briefly _ the same
territory. Such are the mixed feelings Ms. Parks can bring out.
</P>
<P>
   This is her achievement as a writer. Hester is someone of our
time, a character who erupted within the mind of the playwright
because her time had come. That's how right she feels.
</P>
<P>
   My difficulty with ``Marie Christine,'' as it was with last
year's most ``serious'' musical, ``Parade,'' for which Jason Robert
Brown did the music and lyrics, is that there is no sense of
spontaneity about it. It has the manner of a musical more or less
worried into being by people who, having desperately searched for a
worthy subject, have accepted one before the subject had its own
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marie Christine'' is certainly better than ``Parade,'' which
was about the lynching of a Jewish businessman in Georgia in 1915,
but it, too, has the manner of a project of more theoretical than
actual interest. &QL;

 &HT;    Southern Co. unit settles with utility
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Southern Co. unit has reached a $9.25 million
settlement with an Illinois utility that defaulted on power supply
contracts a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Company Energy Marketing has agreed drop its $12.2
million lawsuit against City Water Light &AMP; Power, which is owned by
the city of Springfield. The Springfield City Council and mayor
have agreed to the terms.
</P>
<P>
   David Mould, a spokesman for the Southern wholesale energy
trading subsidiary, said the settlement is ``fair for everyone
involved.'' Springfield spokesman Ernie Slottag called it ``the
best deal for the city.''
</P>
<P>
   City Water Light, which had just entered the wholesale energy
trading business, broke contracts with Southern and a number of
other leading investor-owned utilities during the 1998 heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   The energy trading company that City Water Light &AMP; Power was
buying power from defaulted when wholesale electricity prices
skyrocketed from $30 per megawatt hour to $5,000 in two days.
</P>
<P>
   When City Water Light defaulted, Southern and other customers
were forced to buy electricity for their trading businesses on the
inflated open market. The industry has since put safeguards in
place to avoid a recurrence of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Southern operates its trading business as a
majority partner in a joint venture with Vastar Resources, a
Houston-based subsidiary of Atlantic Richfield. The unit buys and
sells electricity and natural gas from other utilities in
unregulated markets. It was ranked as the No. 4 U.S. electricity
trader and No. 13 natural gas trader in recently published rankings
for the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The unit operates independently from Georgia Power Co. and other
regulated Southern utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Springfield settled a $13.5 million claim by PECO
Energy Co. of Philadelphia for $5.75 million. El Paso Energy Corp.
of Houston is seeking to recover $7.4 million, and LG&AMP;E Corp. of
Louisville, Ky., is seeking $21 million.

 NEW YORK: actual interest. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LaChiusa's music has wit rather than passion. When he becomes
solemn, his lyrics, like the music, begin to sound banal,
inadequate, as in ``I will love you/Too much and more,'' which
isn't quite enough when it issues from a mother who is about to
murder her two small sons.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with the production of ``Marie
Christine,'' directed by Graciela Daniele. It is exceedingly
handsome, and Audra McDonald is in splendid voice in the title
role. This is a big leap for the new star who, until now, has given
glowing performances in supporting, largely reactive roles in
``Carousel,'' ``Master Class'' and ``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Her performance as Marie Christine is a good deal smaller than
her great, lovely soprano. But there isn't a lot to act. Ms.
McDonald looks like a young, naive Medea, and because of that she
seems less like an awe-inspiring pagan witch than an angry baby
sitter. As she seems to stand apart from the character, so the
production and LaChiusa's text seem to stand apart from the
enormity of the tale being told.
</P>
<P>
   The only supporting players who have a chance to register are
Anthony Crivello, who sings well as Dante, the rather thinly
written Jason character, and Mary Testa, who plays a Chicago madam,
a character that exists only to serve the narrative by passing on
information as needed.
</P>
<P>
   As staged by David Esbjornson, ``In the Blood'' has a swiftness
of line and an immediacy of feeling that suggest a series of epic,
Daumieresque caricatures. Except for Ms. Woodard, each of the
actors in the cast has two roles, meaning that all of the children,
ranging in age from 2 to 13, are played by the same adults who also
turn up minutes later as, among others, the woman from welfare, a
nutty street doctor, a hustling preacher, and Hester's first love,
a gentle fellow with a serious hang-up with clocks and being able
to judge the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   Though the unwed mother in ``In the Blood'' is named Hester, and
though there are other associations to ``The Scarlet Letter,'' Ms.
Parks' interest in the novel and in Hawthorne has more to do with
social and psychological responsibility than with anything as
commonplace as plot. The ``A'' that haunts this Hester has nothing
to do with adultery. It's the first and only letter of the alphabet
that she recognizes after all of the attempts of Jabber, her oldest
child, to teach her how to read.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Woodard, the members of the superb cast: Rob
Campbell, Reggie Montgomery, Gail Grate, Bruce MacVittie and
Deirdre O'Connell. Each and every one admirable, in all their
guises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnelli on Minnelli'' is the self-explanatory title of the
show now at _ where else? _ the Palace: Liza Minnelli's
irresistible tribute to her father, Vincente, who, beginning with
``Cabin in the Sky'' in 1943, directed some of MGM's greatest
musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Not since my stereo went to sleep and my old LPs were stored too
long on a radiator have I so enjoyed two hours of looking backward.
Among the films whose scores are recalled: ``Ziegfeld Follies,''
``An American in Paris,'' ``The Band Wagon,'' ``Gigi'' and
``Kismet,'' which provides the star with one of her big hits of the
night: ``Baubles, Bangles and Beads.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Minnelli may be somewhat rounder than when she won her Oscar
for the 1972 ``Cabaret,'' but the need to please is real and the
talent unstoppable. Bob Mackie's spangly jackets, worn over black
slacks, give her whatever show-biz chic she needs. Most important,
the voice can still make bold men weep.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the patter is awkward, but she is great about both her
mum and dad. Fred Ebb's direction keeps everything on track, and
the five dancer-singers who back her up are inexhaustible.
</P>
<P>
   The night's climax is telegraphed early on, and it works anyway:
Liza, live at the Palace in December 1999, singing a duet of ``The
Trolley Song'' with her mother's voice from the soundtrack of
``Meet Me in St. Louis'' (1944, directed by her father). When you
have roots like that, you don't stay at home, hiding them under a
wig. You go to the Palace and sing your heart out.
</P>

<P>
   Bryan Goluboff, author of ``Shyster,'' can write vivid,
compelling characters. They are being played for all they are worth
by the five wizardly actors now in the Naked Angels production _
which closes Sunday _ at the tiny Blue Heron Theater. The
comedy-drama, about a Jewish family whose father has just died,
doesn't seem at all sure about where it is going or how. What are
intended to be plot revelations often play as if the author had
just changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Set on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, this is a
play fueled by the actors, who appear to be having a most
productive time of it. Note Phyllis Newman as the exhausted mother
of the family; Annabella Sciorra as her daughter, badly wounded
during service with the Israeli Army; Fisher Stevens as her drifter
son; Charles Malik Whitfield as the young black man who became the
son that Stevens never was to his recently deceased dad, and
Saundra McClain, who plays Whitfield's mother.
</P>
<P>
   More about the story you need not know. The joy in this
production, directed by Dante Albertie, is watching these nifty
actors give performances you don't often find on Broadway. All the
actors are equally good, but among the equals, Ms. Newman is just a
little bit more equal than anybody else. She is wonderful.

FRANCE SEEKING CONSENSUS ON IRAQ INSPECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FRANCE-U.S.) 
(jt) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France, which has delayed a vote in the Security Council
on a new arms-inspection system for Iraq until Friday, is hoping
for an agreement that all five permanent council members can
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``A text that not everybody on the Security Council votes for is
a great victory for Saddam Hussein,'' President Jacques Chirac said
in an interview. ``A unanimous resolution would be a real defeat
for Saddam, and it would create real pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   France, which had close diplomatic and commercial ties with Iraq
before the war in the Persian Gulf in 1991, would prefer a
resolution that both China and Russia could support rather than
merely let pass by abstaining, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has strongly resisted watering down the
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   France has been trying for months to have Washington agree to
soften conditions to lift the trade embargo against Iraq, in hopes
that Saddam would agree to let inspectors return. They were
expelled more than a year ago, prompting a relentless bombing
campaign by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no indication that Saddam would let
inspections resume even if the embargo were lifted, the French say
even partial international supervision of compliance with a U.N.
ban on producing nuclear, biological or chemical weapons would be
better than none at all.
</P>
<P>
   French officials also say they believe that Iraq has no way of
resuming its quest for nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's much to be worried about where nuclear
weapons are concerned,'' Chirac said. ``But there could be for
other kinds of weapons of mass destruction that are smaller and
easier to conceal. ``I think that the situation as it exists is one
that is advantageous to Saddam. His people have been reduced to a
condition in which they no longer have political reflexes. People
are worrying about what they're going to eat that evening and how
to take care of a sick child without any functioning hospitals or
what to do about a grandfather who's dying, and when people are in
that state, they don't think about much else.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a possibility of suspending the embargo, and people
are better treated, then there would probably be a reaction, and
people might start to ask where Saddam had taken them and why they
had all become victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of money coming into Iraq, because it is
exporting a lot of oil illegally. And Saddam isn't using it to buy
milk for children. So I think we have to find a solution that in
some way forces Saddam to accept a resumption of inspections. And
the only possibility of doing this would be a resolution adopted
unanimously by the Security Council. I think we are not far from
one and I hope we can get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said earlier this week: ``We
think the embargo is a crude and cruel tool that hurts civilians.
We need to agree on how to suspend it, what criteria to use for
such a suspension, and we haven't got agreement on that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine plans to discuss the issue with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and the Russian and British foreign ministers in
Berlin on Friday, before the Security Council vote. Albright is
expected to travel later in the day to Paris.

EGYPT ENVOY SEES ACCORD WITH US ON FLIGHT 990 PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The United States and Egyptian governments are not at
odds but have worked with ``absolutely amazing cooperation'' to
determine what caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, the
Egyptian ambassador to the United States, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Nabil Fahmy would not discuss possible causes of the
Oct. 31 crash off Nantucket, including media speculation that an
Egyptian pilot sent the jetliner into its dive into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with Globe reporters and editors, Fahmy said he is
hopeful that a cause can be determined, but cautioned it could take
a long time.
</P>
<P>
   He implied that much more work is needed to determine if a
mechanical problem or weather brought down the Cairo-bound Boeing
767, which took off from New York's John F. Kennedy International
Airport and went into the steep controlled dive 30 minutes later.
All 217 people aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board has said investigators
have uncovered no sign of mechanical, weather or air traffic
control related problem that could have caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, salvage work is continuing with the Smit Pioneer,
a privately contracted ship, using a crane to haul up human remains
and aircraft parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can reach the point where it is not weather and not
mechanical, at that point we will still not be able to say if there
is evidence of a criminal act or not,'' said Fahmy, who became
ambassador to the US in October and was the individual who
requested the NTSB conduct an investigation into the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Fahmy, who has listened to the cockpit voice recorder tape, said
he was disappointed by leaks that resulted in incorrect and
incomplete information fueling faulty analyses of the crash.
Because of that, he said he would not comment on the tape or any
details of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was been good cooperation between the two
governments. ``This is not an Egyptian-American issue, it is a
human tragedy. . .there has been absolutely amazing cooperation and
no one has seen that or reported it. What we have seen is the
negative implications from leaks by officials.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe has reported that officials familiar with the
investigation believe that co-pilot Gamil El Batouty may have
intentionally disconnected the plane's autopilot, and sent the
plane into its death dive when he was alone in the cockpit. When
Captain Ahmed El Habashi returned to the cockpit there is an
indication the two struggled over control of the plane, before the
engines were turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators want to recover the section below the cockpit to
determine if the metal rod connecting the control columns of the
pilot and co-pilot was sheared off, which would bolster the theory
that the two men battled for the lives of everyone on board. It
takes 50 pounds of pressure to shear the connecting rod.
</P>
<P>
   Fahmy said it will take ``evidence to convince both sides'' and
finding critical parts of the plane could provide ``evidence to
make an objective determination'' of the likely cause. Fahmy said
he did not have the technical knowledge to discuss how much of the
plane, if any, should be reconstructed as part of the investigative
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it was an Egyptian plane, we have a vested interest in
knowing the truth. Because there were Americans on board, the US
has a vested interest,'' he said. ``No one will hide the truth.''

 &HT;    Georgia-Pacific's Timber Co. completes sale of California tracts
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The timber unit of Georgia-Pacific Corp. has finished
selling off land that doesn't fit the company's focus.
</P>
<P>
   Timber Co. said Thursday it completed the previously announced
sale of 194,000 acres in California to Hawthorne Timber Co. for
$397 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since May 1998, Atlanta-based Timber Co. has been selling
forests in Maine, West Virginia and New Brunswick, Canada, to
streamline its business and boost profit.
</P>
<P>
   Trees in Maine and New Brunswick, for example, were
slow-growing. The California timberlands included redwood trees
that were too specialized, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has sold 1 million acres, or about 20 percent of its
land base, as part of the repositioning. Timber Co.'s remaining 4.8
million acres, mostly fast-growing Southern pine trees, represent
some of the most productive forest land in the world, said Don
Glass, president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we're positioned now, we'll double our harvest over
the next 30 years in the South,'' Glass said. Through increased use
of farming techniques and technology, foresters can map and manage
trees down to 10-acre plots _ making them substantially more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trees we put in the ground today are twice as productive
as trees 30 years ago,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   Timber Co. harvested 14.6 million tons of timber in 1998, of
which 11.9 million tons were sold to Georgia-Pacific Group. Timber
Co. is the largest independent seller of logs in the country, Glass
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it has finished its major land sales, Timber Co.
will continue to buy, sell and trade small land parcels, Glass
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the company plans to step up its ongoing share repurchase
program. Timber Co. has repurchased nearly 11 million shares, or 12
percent of outstanding shares, since Georgia-Pacific made the
company a separate stock in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Timber Co. closed Thursday at $24.06 1/4, down 81 1/4 cents.

LEWINSKY TESTIFIES SHE DIDN'T CONSENT TO TAPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLICOTT CITY, Md. _ Monica S. Lewinsky exacted some payback
Thursday as she provided damaging testimony against her former
friend, Linda R. Tripp, in a wiretapping case stemming from Tripp's
betrayal of Lewinsky's secret affair with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, testifying publicly for the first time since the
scandal, told a packed courtroom she reacted with horror when she
discovered last January that Tripp had circulated secret recordings
of Lewinsky confiding her sexual affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As a Maryland prosecutor showed her a copy of a Newsweek
magazine containing transcripts of the Tripp tapes, Lewinsky said,
``It terrified me because I was concerned about the privacy of my
relationship being revealed.''
</P>
<P>
   The former White House intern added, ``I was pretty upset. That
was frightening to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, who has made no secret of her disdain for Tripp,
interrupted her current pursuit _ an entrepreneurial foray into the
handbag industry _ to help prosecutors press two counts of illegal
wiretapping against her former confidante.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing dark glasses and a black pants suit, Lewinsky
sidestepped a swarm of journalists as she rushed in and out of the
Howard County Circuit Court through a rear door, guarding what
little remains of the private life she once led as a White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, who did not attend the hearing, faces up to 10 years in
prison and $20,000 in fines if she is convicted on the two charges.
Tripp has described the case against her as ``unfair and
vindictive,'' the work of Clinton allies who want to ``destroy''
her.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's tapes, which she also gave to former independent counsel
Kenneth W. Starr, became the key evidence in the impeachment saga.
The case ended with Clinton's acquittal in the first Senate trial
of a president in 131 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky appeared generally unflustered in 90 minutes on the
witness stand as she provided a linchpin for the prosecution's case
by repeatedly testifying that she did not give Tripp consent to
tape her conversations. Maryland law prohibits taping a
conversation without the permission of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Seated beneath crystal chandeliers in the court, in suburban
Baltimore, Lewinsky insisted under cross-examination, ``I had not
consented'' to the taping.
</P>
<P>
   She addressed another pivotal point for the prosecution by
testifying that she relied only on her memory to identify the date
that the tapes in question were recorded: Dec. 22, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors must prove in the pretrial hearing that they did not
use any information that was protected under Tripp's immunity
agreement with Starr in building their case, including Tripp's
grand jury testimony about the date the tape was recorded.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewinsky was Challenged by Tripp's lawyer, Joseph Murtha,
about her recollection of the date, she said, ``It was etched in my
mind because it was a pretty frightening time for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky was not asked about her relationship with Clinton or
her feelings toward Tripp, though Murtha indicated he will try to
portray Lewinsky as a biased witness when the full trial begins
next month.
</P>
<P>
   After Lewinsky's testimony, Murtha cited a passage from the
book, ``Monica's Story,'' written by Andrew Morton with Lewinsky's
cooperation. The book describes Lewinsky and her family
experiencing ``unalloyed pleasure'' when they learned Tripp was
under investigation in the taping episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in our family wants Linda Tripp to lie awake at night
worrying about going to jail,'' the book quotes Lewinsky as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her apparent hostility toward Tripp, Lewinsky
occasionally joked with Tripp's lawyers. At one point, she
playfully scolded Murtha for misstating her birth date, saying,
``Nope, nope, nope.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead prosecutor, Stephen Montanarelli, said he was ``very
pleased'' with Lewinsky's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha told reporters Lewinsky was in an ``unenviable
situation,'' having to endure the latest twist in the scandal.
``But at the same time,'' Murtha said, ``this situation is of her
own making and I am here to defend my client.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Diane O. Leasure, is expected to rule as early as
Friday on which evidence can be used in the trial.

BRAIN SCAN FOUND EFFECTIVE IN DIAGNOSING ATTENTION DISORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brain scans have identified a clear-cut chemical abnormality in
people with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, a problem
that makes life difficult for an estimated 3 to 5 percent of US
schoolchildren, scientists say..
</P>
<P>
   It could be a first step toward a long-sought objective test for
ADHD, say researchers at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts
General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Such a test would go far to resolve a continuing and intense
dispute about whether stimulant medications like Ritalin are being
overprescribed as a treatment for ADHD.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it could reveal whether there are different forms
of ADHD that respond better or worse to specific drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an interesting, promising, beginning,'' said Dr. Edward
Hallowell, a psychiatrist and author of ``Driven to Distraction,''
a book about ADHD. He was not involved in the study. A test would
be welcome, he said, ``because now it's based on the person's
history and psychological testing, so there's an element of
ambiguity'' about the diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   People with ADHD tend to be overly active, distractible,
unfocused, and impulsive, and as a result have a difficult time in
school, social life and careers.
</P>
<P>
   Previously suspected causes such as family surroundings, diet
and allergies have largely been discarded as mounting evidence
implicates brain abnormalities probably due to altered genes, said
Russell A. Barkley, an ADHD researcher in the psychology and
psychiatry departments of the University of Massachusetts Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The brain scanning experiment found a chemical imbalance, which
had been previously suspected, in a part of the brain that uses the
nerve messenger dopamine. Dopamine helps regulate attention and
inhibits impulsive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Six adult patients who had been diagnosed with ADHD with
standard tests had on average 70 percent more of a protein called
the dopamine transporter than did a group of 30 normal volunteers,
said the researchers. ``I think it's very exciting,'' said Dr.
Thomas Spencer, an MGH researcher and an author of the study. ``It
was stunning that a problem in their brain corresponded to their
symptoms'' in all six ADHD patients.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the study will be published Saturday as a letter in
the British journal Lancet. In the brief article, the Massachusetts
researchers described injecting patients with a radioactively
tagged chemical agent called Altropane, which accumulated in
dramatically higher levels in a particular part of the dopamine
system in the brains of the ADHD patients.
</P>
<P>
   The disorder varies a great deal among people, so the new method
will have to prove itself able to diagnose a wide range of ADHD
types, and also needs confirmation in children, the researchers
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly not yet a diagnostic test'' because it
involved a ``very refined sample'' of ADHD patients who aren't
representative of the entire spectrum of those who have it, said
Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   But if confirmed, he added, the test could help answer skeptics
who question whether ADHD is a real disorder, and not just a poorly
defined label placed on very active, normally rebellious chldren.
Barkley noted, though, that gene tests for ADHD may arrive at the
same time or even more quickly than the scanning test.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the research being described in the Lancet report was
supported by Boston Life Sciences, Inc., which says it intends to
develop Altropane as an ADHD test. It has already made a test using
Altropane to detect early signs of Parkinson disease, the
degenerative brain disorder caused by a loss of dopamine-containing
nerve cells that leads to movement and gait disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Altropane, said Dr. Alan J. Fischman, an MGH nuclear medicine
specialist and senior author of the study, is a synthetic analogue
of cocaine. Its molecules bind very tightly to molecules in the
brain known as dopamine transporters, which regulate the amount of
dopamine in certain parts of the brain. (People injected with
Altropane for the imaging tests don't feel any cocaine-like effects
because the amount is so small, Fischman said.)
</P>
<P>
   Altropane was designed by Bertha K. Madras of Harvard's New
England Regional Primate Center in Southboro, Mass., who first had
the idea of measuring the dopamine transporter in Parkinson disease
and ADHD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea came from a study I had done in the 1980s showing
that Ritalin targets the dopamine transporter'' and binds to it
tightly, said Madras. She suggested that the dopamine transporter
might be a key player in ADHD, and if so, measuring the amount of
the molecules could serve as a test.
</P>
<P>
   After showing that Altropane homed in on different dopamine
structures in Parkinson disease and was developed as a test for it,
the researchers, in an alliance with Boston Life Sciences, turned
to ADHD.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental test required the volunteers to have Altropane
injected intravenously. As it flowed through the brain, Altropane
accumulated in the dopamine transporter molecules of the patients
with ADHD and the difference between them and the normal patients
was detected with an instrument known as a SPECT scanner. It took
30 to 45 minutes for the instrument to make the measurement.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are in the process of designing larger studies,
probably involving hundreds of patients, to determine how reliable
and accurate the method will prove to be. Testing the Altropane
technique on children can come only after ethics review boards are
convinced that it is safe, said the scientists.

 &HT;    NBC puts Games on cable networks
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC-TV will break new ground at the 2000 Sydney Olympics by
offering 172 hours of original coverage on its cable networks CNBC
and MSNBC, it was announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the Summer Games will be shown on basic
cable, starting a trend that will continue through the 2008
Olympics. All coverage will be taped.
</P>
<P>
   Pat O'Brien of ``Access Hollywood'' and HBO's Jim Lampley will
host the Sydney coverage on CNBC and MSNBC, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leaped at the chance to be a part of history. This is an
unbelievable project,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entire soccer and basketball games will be shown,'' Lampley
said. ``People can choose to see certain events that might not have
been readily available.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable coverage will begin on MSNBC, two days before the
opening ceremony, with men's soccer on Sept. 13, followed the next
day by the opener of the U.S. women's soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC will air the Sydney Games from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Eastern)
on weekdays, repeating each telecast at midnight for an additional
101 hours of coverage. Its weekend hours were not released.
</P>
<P>
   The CNBC telecasts will be 5-9 p.m. on weekdays and 4-9 p.m. on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 finals will be shown on cable, including boxing,
soccer, tennis, equestrian, water polo, baseball and weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC did a great job in Atlanta, but the criticism was not what
we did, but what was left out,'' said NBC Olympics co-chairman
Dennis Swanson. ``There is some overlap with the network coverage,
but the important thing is that the American public will be able to
see more of the Olympics than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   The only time the Summer Games have been televised beyond ``free
TV'' was at Barcelona in 1992, when NBC tried a disastrous
experiment with pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not anything like that,'' said Swanson.
</P>

 &HT;    NBC puts Games on cable networks
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC-TV will break new ground at the 2000 Sydney Olympics by
offering 172 hours of original coverage on its cable networks CNBC
and MSNBC, it was announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the Summer Games will be shown on basic
cable, starting a trend that will continue through the 2008
Olympics. All coverage will be taped.
</P>
<P>
   Pat O'Brien of ``Access Hollywood'' and HBO's Jim Lampley will
host the Sydney coverage on CNBC and MSNBC, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leaped at the chance to be a part of history. This is an
unbelievable project,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entire soccer and basketball games will be shown,'' Lampley
said. ``People can choose to see certain events that might not have
been readily available.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable coverage will begin on MSNBC, two days before the
opening ceremony, with men's soccer on Sept. 13, followed the next
day by the opener of the U.S. women's soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC will air the Sydney Games from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Eastern)
on weekdays, repeating each telecast at midnight for an additional
101 hours of coverage. Its weekend hours were not released.
</P>
<P>
   The CNBC telecasts will be 5-9 p.m. on weekdays and 4-9 p.m. on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 finals will be shown on cable, including boxing,
soccer, tennis, equestrian, water polo, baseball and weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC did a great job in Atlanta, but the criticism was not what
we did, but what was left out,'' said NBC Olympics co-chairman
Dennis Swanson. ``There is some overlap with the network coverage,
but the important thing is that the American public will be able to
see more of the Olympics than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   The only time the Summer Games have been televised beyond ``free
TV'' was at Barcelona in 1992, when NBC tried a disastrous
experiment with pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not anything like that,'' said Swanson.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC is available in 71 million homes, including nearly all of
metro Atlanta. MSNBC, limited in metro Atlanta, is available in 51
million homes.

REPUBLICANS OPEN 'GORE STORE,' 'BRADLEY BOUTIQUE'

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Poking fun at Democratic presidential hopefuls Al
Gore and Bill Bradley, the Republican Party on Thursday opened the
``Gore Store'' and ``Bradley Boutique'' for holiday shoppers with a
taste for political sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   The stores offered such items as the ``I Invented the Internet''
mousepad for $15, which mocked Gore's retracted claim than he
invented the World Wide Web, and $15 ``Alpha Male'' baseball caps
that allude to the hiring of a feminist writer by the Gore campaign
to help the vice president appear more masculine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is your chance to grab that last-minute stocking stuffer
or gift for those hard-to-buy-for friends and relatives,'' said Jim
Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee. The party
said proceeds from the one-day sale, which was held at the
committee's headquarters near the U.S. Capitol, will be donated to
the United Way.
</P>
<P>
   Other items for sale at the so-called ``Gore Store'' were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Al Gore business cards at $5 for a pack of 50. The cards make
fun of what Republicans say is the Gore penchant for inflating his
resume. Among the jobs listed on the cards, which bear the quote,
``You name it, I've done it,'' were tobacco farmer, homebuilder,
inspirer of the book ``Love Story,'' and Internet inventor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Copies of Gore's book on the environment, ``Earth in the
Balance'' for $10. The book _ which many Republicans consider
alarmist _ comes with a candle, which would be used to read the
book and to save electricity.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $20 computer from the 1980s, before the Internet was broadly
available for use.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Bradley Boutique'' offered only one product: A Bill
Bradley Speech Survival Kit. Making fun of what even Bradley admits
are his less than scintillating speaking skills, the $10 kit
includes a coffee mug with a picture of the candidate on it, along
with a bag of high-caffeine coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're listening to a Bradley stump speech, this gift could
be the difference between you and an hour-long nap,'' said
Nicholson, who wore a red Santa hat.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the rush of Republican holiday shoppers at the
store, the most popular item was the mousepad, which has a picture
of Gore next to a computer saying, ``I invented the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just such a ridiculous statement,'' said Mike Newman, a
political consultant in Washington. ``I laugh every time I think of
him saying that, so now I have it next to my computer, which I
think Gore invented as well.''
</P>
<P>
   With about half of the merchandise sold, Nicholson announced
that the RNC had achieved its goal of raising $353, the amount Gore
reported giving to charity on his 1997 tax return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit it wasn't the hardest goal to reach, but it took Al
Gore a whole year to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the Gore campaign could be reached for comment on the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   A Bradley campaign official called the Republican event
``silly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a perfect contrast between the Republicans and
Bill Bradley,'' said Bradley spokesman Tony Wyche. ``While they're
selling gimmicks, Bill was talking how to get special interests out
of the political process.''

MOSCOW VOTERS FACED WITH GRIM MESSAGE FROM CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The grim reports of more than 100 dead Russian soldiers
sprawled on the streets of Chechnya's capital Grozny have cast a
dark shadow over what has until now been portrayed by Moscow as a
relatively easy military campaign against separatist fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel ambush of a Russian armored column late Wednesday _
just days before Sunday's national election _ sent the message that
if Moscow is going to achieve its stated goal of wiping out the
Chechen insurgents, it will have to pay a heavy price in the lives
of its soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   This is a message the Kremlin does not want voters to hear on
the eve of the vote _ especially now that the pro-government Unity
bloc has ridden the apparent success of the war to second place in
most popularity polls.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, most Russian voters did not hear it. Senior
officials dismissed first-hand accounts of the massacre by
correspondents working for Western news agencies in Grozny.
Official Russian media carried denials the battle took place,
denials of the high casualties, and statements blaming the reports
of the ambush on a conspiracy of foreign powers to try to discredit
the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction underscored the importance of Moscow's
``anti-terrorist operation'' in Chechnya to the Kremlin's domestic
political strategy, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you analyze the Chechen war as an anti-terrorist operation,
it makes no sense,'' said Alexander Zhilin, military analyst for
the weekly Moscow News. ``But if you analyze it from the point of
view of domestic politics, it makes perfect sense. The point is to
get Kremlin allies elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhilin and other military experts questioned the rationale
behind sending Russian troops into Grozny, where up to 7,000 rebel
fighters, hardened by their experience in fighting Moscow to a
humiliating stalemate in a 1994-1996 war, are dug in and waiting
for a battle.
</P>
<P>
   Zhilin said it would be more logical for the larger, more
powerful Russian force, which surrounded Grozny last month, to keep
up pressure on the rebels by just maintaining its seige of the
capital. But he said that the generals had been under pressure to
take Grozny in time to give a victory for the war's architect anKremlin's presidential hopeful, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin,
that could be parlayed into votes for the Unity coalition he has
actively backed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was done to take Grozny on the eve of elections,''
Zhilin said. ``But this could mean that the army will suffer great
losses.''
</P>
<P>
   General Valery Manilov, deputy chief of Russia's general staff,
denied that the army had tried to capture Grozny, and dismissed the
reports of fighting as ``planned disinformation.'' The military
said only two soldiers had died in Wednesday's fighting in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Federal Security Service, post-Communist
successor to the KGB, went further. Reflecting Russian anger over
Western criticism about Chechnya, the spokesman suggested that the
whole ambush story was an anti-Russian plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``With just a couple of days to go to the election, it is very
important, considering the position some Western countries have
taken with regard to Russia ... to present our military as being
incapable of effective action,'' said the spokesman, Alexander
Zdanovich.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, an Associated Press reporter described counting the
bodies of at least 115 Russian soldiers as they lay next to the
burned-out hulks of seven Russian tanks and other armored vehicles
in a Grozny square. On Wednesday night, Reuters reporter Maria
Eismont, a veteran Russian war correspondent, described nearly the
same scene and said she counted more than 100 Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Both reports described hundreds of Chechen fighters firing
rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns at a column of about 15
armored vehicles that had somehow wandered from the eastern
outskirts Russian troops control to the vast Minutka square, just
south of the city center.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts conjured grim images of the disastrous attempts to
storm Grozny at the beginning of the 1994-1996 war, when poorly
trained draftees sent into the city in an ill-conceived tank
assault were cut down by rebels firing hand-held anti-tank weapons.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Russian officials have worked hard to prevent
people from making parallels to the last conflict. Now, Moscow
severely restricts access to the combat zone. Instead, a government
press center presents journalists with daily briefings that detail
the successes of the Russian tactics. Few journalists have been
able to get into Grozny. No footage of Wednesday's attack was
available.
</P>
<P>
   While controlling information about the fighting, Kremlin allies
have made little secret of the political backdrop of the war in
Chechnya. Ostensibly started in response to attacks by Chechen-led
Islamic rebels on neighboring Dagestan and a wave of deadly
apartment bombings last summer Moscow blames on the rebels, the war
has been portrayed by some politicians as a rallying cry for a
nation that has suffered nothing but setbacks and humilitation
since the 1991 Soviet breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not Chechnya,'' said Anatoly Chubais, a leader of
a bloc of economic liberals which has formed a coalition with the
pro-Kremlin Unity bloc. ``What is being decided in Chechya is a far
more important issue _ the revival of the Russian army.''
</P>
<P>
   This euphoria has carried over to much of the Russian press,
which was highly critical of the last war. The Russian military's
march across Chechnya so far has faced limited resistance from the
outgunned militants, who have repeatedly retreated rather than wage
full-scale ground battles.
</P>
<P>
   Even though some analysts say the Russian advance through
Chechnya has gone slowly, and at a high cost _ Moscow admits losing
over 400 soldiers in the fighting _ the Russian media have given
the army its backing.
</P>
<P>
   Few Russian journalists actually make it to Chechnya, partly in
response to a wave of kidnappings in the region that targeted
correspondents. Many of the reports from Chechnya depict
competent-looking and motivated troops and their successes. There
have certainly been some of those, but the reports ignore the
setbacks, and the grimy, scrawny draftees who are once again
involved in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, wounded soldiers in a military hospital pleaded with
two American reporters to tell the truth about their units, which
they described as poorly equipped and poorly led. Last week,
soldiers on the outskirts of Grozny described a costly ambush of
Russian troops in the suburbs of the capital that went unreported
in the Russian press.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no willingness of the main news media to get this info
to the people,'' said Alan Rousso, director of the Carnegie Moscow
Center. ``This reflects an unwilingness of the people to hear the
real story. People like the story their getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who criticizes the military has been branded an enemy of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Moscow's Mayor Yury Luzhkov, leader of a centrist bloc
competing with Unity for votes in Sunday's election, raised
concerns about the Russian tactics in Chechnya, particularly
heaving bombing of areas populated by civilians. When Luzhkov's
ally, former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, repeated these
concerns, Kremlin-controlled television stations accused the two of
being in the employ of foreign powers which are plotting to weaken
Russia's influence in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday in Chechnya, Russian forces shelled Grozny through the
night and into this morning, even though many of the estimated
10,000 to 45,000 civilians in the city remained trapped in their
makeshift basement bunkers, unable to reach safe corridors set up
with much fanfare by Unity's leading candidate, Emergency Minister
Sergei Shoigu.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts believe the tanks that were trapped in Grozny were
part of a reconaissance mission gone badly awry, and not an attempt
to storm the city. Alexander Golts of the news magazine Itogi said
that the unit probably was scouting out Chechen defenses in
preparation for an all-out attack and, encountering no resistance,
kept going until it reached the city center.
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts believe that the rebels, despite their success
Wednesday, can hold Grozny. But the Russian mission, as originally
defined, was not intended to include an assault on the capital.
</P>
<P>
   When Russian forces entered Chechya, officials said they
intended to set up a security zone around the region and destroy
terrorist bases. Then they changed that to a security zone that cut
half-way through Chechnya. Now, with elections approaching, the
goal has changed to occupying as much of the region as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is for the ruling party to stay in power, and the
strategy has been to show successs, success, success,'' Zhilin
said. ``This false victory, when the Russian troops raise flags
over every Chechen town, is near. But then we will see the
beginning of the real war.''

EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE SAID TO BLOCK CRAVING FOR NICOTINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists say they have devised a vaccine that blocks nicotine
from entering the brain, raising the prospect of a novel way to
help smokers quit.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental vaccine has been tested so far only in
laboratory rats, but a government-sponsored study shows it reduced
the amount of nicotine entering the animals' brains by almost
two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant, scientists say, the vaccine blocked nicotine's
effect in raising blood pressure and it prevented hyperactive
behavior that researchers see when they inject the animals with
nicotine, the addictive ingredient in tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that ``vaccinated persons would not be able to get
a `kick' from the nicotine in tobacco smoke or chewing tobacco,''
Dr. Alan I. Leshner, director of the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, which funded the research, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Human trials of the vaccine are planned within two years.
</P>
<P>
   Federal health officials hope nicotine immunization will be
among the first of several vaccines against addiction. Also in
early stages are vaccines against cocaine, methamphetamine, and
PCP, an anesthetic drug called phencycladine that is often abused.
Leshner said the cocaine vaccine is closest to human trials.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of an anti-nicotine vaccine, Leshner said, is
``tremendous'' because smoking remains ``one of the biggest public
health problems in this country, and we need to have as many
treatment approaches as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Although overall smoking rates have declined, an estimated 60
million Americans still smoke cigarettes, according to the drug
abuse institute. Among adults between the ages of 18 and 25, the
smoking rate has steadily crept upward in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional vaccines are designed to stimulate the production of
antibodies against infectious organisms, such as polio or hepatitis
virus. The idea of immunizing against addictive substances
represents ``a very new and different use for a vaccine,'' said Dr.
Paul Pentel of Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Pentel is a coauthor of the new study on a nicotine vaccine,
which appears in the journal Pharmacology, Biochemistry and
Behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Although nicotine, like a virus, is foreign to the body, it is
too small a molecule to be recognized by the immune system, Pentel
said. To make a vaccine, researchers at a Florida-based company
called Nabi Pharmaceuticals attached nicotine to a protein derived
from the outer coat of a bacterium. That enabled the immune system
to make antibodies to the nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers later injected regular nicotine into the lab
rats, the vaccine-induced antibodies attached to it and prevented
it from passing into the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine has so far produced no obvious harmful effects in
laboratory animals. Because antibodies are generally not able to
pass through a natural barrier that shields the brain from large
molecules, the vaccine-induced antibodies bind to nicotine outside
the brain and ``presumably would not disrupt other behaviors and
brain functions,'' Pentel said.
</P>
<P>
   Most existing treatments for drug abuse act on brain receptors
or neurotransmitters, the chemicals that allow brain cells to
communicate with each other. This can create side effects that
presumably a vaccine may avoid.
</P>
<P>
   A nicotine vaccine would most likely be used to help smokers
quit the habit, although Pentel said it might be used to immunize
people at high risk of nicotine addiction, such as teenagers who
have just started to smoke.

 &HT;    With 3 weekends to go, 3 hot division races
 &HT;    Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NFL starts playing games on Saturday this weekend, so you
know things are getting serious.
</P>
<P>
   With only three weeks left in the regular season, three
divisions are still up for grabs _ the AFC West and the NFC Central
and East.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFC West, the St. Louis Rams already have won the
division. The Colts and Jaguars soon could follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts, riding a franchise-record nine consecutive victories,
are one away from tying the 1929 Giants and 1963 Raiders for the
biggest single-season turnaround in history. The Colts can claim
the AFC East on Sunday by beating or tying the Redskins, or with a
loss or tie by the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars have won 10 games in a row and are the first AFC
Central team since the 1975 Steelers to have a 12-1 record.
Jacksonville can win the division by beating the lowly Browns, or
with a loss or tie by the Titans, who play the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to win a division, trying to win a Super Bowl,''
Jags offensive tackle Tony Boselli said. ``It doesn't matter how we
get there, or what we look like, as long as we get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the league is battling for position.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins need to upset the Colts in Indianapolis to stay at
least one game ahead of the Cowboys and Giants in the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFC Central, Detroit must beat Chicago to stay within one
game of the Buccaneers, who travel to Oakland. The Packers and
Vikings meet on Monday night, and the loser could fall out of the
playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   The reeling Seahawks, who have lost three in a row to fall into
a first-place tie with the Chiefs in the AFC West, must beat
Denver, which has lost only once in its past 14 home games.
</P>
<P>
   Divisional match: Unlike the Falcons, the two-time defending
Super Bowl champion Broncos are still playing inspired football.
They nearly upset Jacksonville on the road last week. With a
victory at home Sunday, Denver could knock the Seahawks one game
behind the Chiefs, who should beat reeling Pittsburgh on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Grudge match: Carolina coach George Seifert gets another shot at
the 49ers, who forced him out of San Francisco after the 1996
season. The Panthers won 31-29 at San Francisco on Oct. 17. It
could be much worse in Charlotte on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Upset opportunity: Tampa Bay rookie Shaun King won his first two
starts, giving the Bucs a one-game lead in the NFC Central. But
King starts his first NFL road game Sunday at Oakland, which isn't
a friendly place to play.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy play: Titans running back Eddie George had 199 rushing
yards vs. Oakland last week. The Falcons rank 29th in the league
against the run, so George could post more gaudy numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Individual match: With Falcons right tackle Ephraim Salaam
sidelined with a hip injury, second-year pro Jose Portilla could
make his first start at Tennessee. Portilla's assignment will be
stopping Titans rookie Jevon Kearse, who leads the AFC with 11 1/2
sacks. Ouch.

 &HT;    A royal bore: Storytelling flat, views gorgeous in new `Anna'
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Anna and the King'' _ the fourth
cinematic account of the adventures of schoolmarm Anna Leonowens in
Siam, circa 1862 _ is a visual feast. The movie itself is a mess,
but it looks gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   You probably know the story by now, from either the 1946 version
that pitted Irene Dunne against Rex Harrison as the Siamese
monarch, or from the 1956 musical adaptation with Deborah Kerr and
Yul Brynner. Or the least of the options, the 1999 animated musical
hodgepodge.
</P>
<P>
   Such familiarity breeds a yen for something new, but for the
first hour or so, ``Anna and the King'' plods earnestly along
telling its too-well-known West-meets-East tale of the British
widow who goes to Siam to teach the many offspring of King Mongkut
about the world. It covers the usual ground with only minor tweaks
for historical accuracy or political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping into Mrs. Leonowens' Victorian hoop skirts this time is
the estimable, intelligent Jodie Foster, who invariably gives each
role her complete commitment. Here, however, that amounts to lots
of forehead furrowing and such a resolutely stern, clenched jaw
that the actress has little ability to register any expression.
</P>
<P>
   Chow Yun-Fat (yup, the action figure from ``The Replacement
Killers'') fares somewhat better, sporting a full head of hair in
an attempt to avoid comparison with Brynner. He makes the king more
erudite, less of a barbarian, but no less perplexed by his
adversarial female employee. Alas, he is gypped out of a
scenery-chewing death scene like his predecessors had.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not, as you might imagine, the lack of Rodgers
and Hammerstein songs, even though you might miss the strains of
``Shall We Dance?'' when Mongkut takes Anna in his arms for one of
several ballroom spins. Rather it is the feeling that neither
director Andy Tennant (``Ever After'') nor screenwriters Steve
Meerson and Peter Krikes (``Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'') has
any new ideas for the story, beyond luxuriating in the surroundings
found in Mayalsia, the film's shooting site.
</P>
<P>
   Then, about two-thirds of the way through the overlong movie,
someone must have looked at the daily rushes and realized how bland
a film they were making. Suddenly, we are thrown into a
full-blooded, buckle-swashing war between the Siamese and the
Burmese, as abruptly as when the animated version decided to make
the king an action-adventure hero. As if that weren't enough to
satisfy all those with no interest in pretty scenery and a
near-romance story, Mongkut's new concubine Tuptim (the delicately
beautiful Bai Ling) and her clandestine lover are given a
slow-motion ritual beheading.
</P>
<P>
   Better concentrate instead on the lovely scenery, the
sumptuously recreated palace, the pageantry of the exotic
livestock, the teeming marketplace, the decadent banquets, and on
and on, concocted by production designer Luciana Arrighi and
captured with fairy-tale high gloss by cinematographer Caleb
Deschanel. There is something about this story that brings out the
best in technicians. Both earlier live-action versions won Oscars
for art direction and were nominated and/or won for cinematography.
``Anna and the King'' could easily join that group.
</P>
<P>
   But as for a truly involving, novel take on the tale, it is
unlikely that audiences will be whistling a happy tune. They may,
however, leave the theater whistling the scenery.

 &HT;    `Ride With Devil' gives Civil War human face
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Where you think we are, we ain't,'' says a guerrilla
leader on the Missouri-Kansas frontier during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar might be said about Ang Lee, the
Taiwanese-born director of the handsome ``Ride With the Devil.''
Look for him where he was _ and he isn't.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Eat Drink Man Woman,'' Lee made a meal out of his Chinese
roots. But he then chose an item from Column B _ namely, the
Regency England period in ``Sense and Sensibility.'' Would he stick
with the classics? Nope, he motored off to suburban Connecticut
with ``The Ice Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   So don't look for him in modern America. His new movie is a
horse opera about love, freedom and coming-of-age amid a bloody
sideshow of the Civil War. The film flirts with the epic. But its
real strength resides in small scenes featuring acutely observed
characters. Contemplative moments and sly jokes flourish amid the
carnage.
</P>
<P>
   By design, this is a measured action movie. But it's also a tad
too long _ largely because about midway the narrative focus shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Be patient. This gear-grinding turns a sleek shoot-'em-up into a
thoughtful study of human and social transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Devil'' features a cast of promising young actors. Tobey
Maguire (``The Ice Storm'') and Skeet Ulrich (``Scream'') play
teen-age pals who join a guerrilla band fighting the Yankee
``invaders'' of their native Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich is Jack Bull Chiles, the smoldering son of a plantation
owner. Maguire is Jake Roedel, the son of German immigrants. He's
never allowed to forget that Missouri's Germans are Union
sympathizers. Despite his proven courage, Jake remains a watchful
outsider.
</P>
<P>
   The friends' comrades include the bemused Cavalier, George Clyde
(Simon Baker), and his friend and former slave, Daniel Holt
(Jeffrey Wright).
</P>
<P>
   Like Jake, Holt is an outsider fighting under the Confederate
banner. He's loyal to the man who bought his ``freedom.'' As the
film unfolds, Jake and Holt form a silent bond transcending war and
race.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is full of bloody ambushes, breakneck horsemanship and
one showy set battle. Lee captures the fierce hatreds that animated
the ``border wars.''
</P>
<P>
   However, ``Devil'' takes an inward turn when the friends
encounter Sue Lee, played effectively enough by the singer Jewel,
who owns a 19th-century face. Recently widowed, she encourages
their awkward attentions. The result is pregnant with possibilities
in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   The sloe-eyed Maguire conveys innocence, wariness and a stubborn
streak. At first, he can kill without a cringe. We watch him
develop a conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire's deliberate speech also suits the formal syntax of the
era, making innocuous remarks sound like eloquent prose. (This may
charm some viewers; grate on others.)
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich is more flamboyant, a commanding presence in a more
obvious way, although at times he seems to be trying on attitudes
rather than acting. As the sensitive former slave, Wright
(``Basquiat'') is an occasional scene-stealer.
</P>
<P>
   Although filled with violence, ``Ride With the Devil'' is a
sentimental film. As in any good Western, the war's survivors ride
into the sunset to embrace the future.
</P>
<P>
   Lee lets it be known that their future will be ruled by the new,
overarching principle of American life firmly set in motion by the
Union victory _ equality, or the right of the individual to
personal fulfillment.

ICELANDERS CLING TO ELFIN FOLKLORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAFNARFJORDUR, Iceland _ This can be a tough country for
blasting out a foundation or constructing a roadbed.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the boiling geysers, wind-blasted precipices or
frozen barrens. It's not the razor-sharp lava rock that daunts
builders; it's the hidden people lurking below.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all sorts of beings beneath our stones,'' said
Brynjolfur Snorrason, a folklorist often asked to advise
contractors on how best to avoid the lairs of Iceland's elves and
other seldom-seen creatures whose presence nonetheless still seems
to permeate this far northern island nation.
</P>
<P>
   Highway engineers in recent years have been forced to reroute
roads around supposed elf dwellings. Similarly, builders of the
country's first shopping mall took care to lay electrical cables
and other underground installations well away from suspected abodes
of gnomes and fairies. Couples planning a new house will sometimes
hire ``elf-spotters'' to ensure the lot is free of spirit folk.
</P>
<P>
   In Iceland, such precautions are seen as simple prudence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a strange country,'' said Arni Bjornsson, head of
ethnological studies at the National Museum of Iceland. ``Even
hard-headed engineers, who say they don't hold with superstition,
will build a road around a certain hill or boulder rather than take
the risk of offending elves.''
</P>
<P>
   Icelanders love to boast of how their beloved island republic
marches in the front rank of modern times. Literacy, 100 percent.
Poverty, zero. High-technology, all pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland is the most geographically remote of Europe's nations _
a thinly-populated realm of fire and ice rising from the North
Atlantic, just below the Arctic Circle _ but it's plugged in,
powered up and prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   And also overrun with elves, gnomes, trolls, light-fairies,
lovelings and a unique species called ``huldufolk,'' or hidden
people. Iceland even has a glut of 13 unjolly Santas, the so-called
Yuletide Lads, who skulk about cities, towns and rural farmsteads
each Christmas _ traditionally bringing more mayhem than merriment,
although lately they've stopped stealing children.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's president, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, theorizes that
the surfeit of spirit-beings stems from Icelanders' abiding sense
of loneliness and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Icelanders are few in number, so in the old times we doubled
our population with tales of elves and fairies,'' he said in an
interview at the presidential residence, Bessastadir, located on a
remote moor where snow dervishes and sea spume whip over
bizarrely-shaped formations of lava rock.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, there are only 273,000 people occupying a land
roughly the size of Maine and Massachusetts. And Icelanders still
take spirit folk seriously: Public opinion polls and academic
studies show more than half of all inhabitants think it possible or
probable _ 10 percent call it ``certain'' _ they share their island
with otherly beings, ranging from grumpy glacier-dwelling trolls to
occasionally gregarious hidden people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everywhere in Iceland you will find people who believe
in such things,'' said Audbjorg Halldorsdottir, an official with
the country's Oveseas Business Service. ``Or if they don't believe,
exactly, they don't disbelieve entirely. Folklore remains part of
everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   That lore is the occasional bane oruction engineers and
real estate developers. Earlier this year, Iceland's highway agency
had to change the course of a new road leading out of Reykjavik
after citizens protested that the original route would disturb an
elf's lair under a big rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who believe in elves, and we try to show
respect for people's beliefs,'' said Viktor Ingolfsson, an official
of the department. ``If that means building around an elf stone, we
try to accommodate.''
</P>
<P>
   Such broadmindedness might be just self-protection. Tales abound
of broken limbs, busted equipment and other woes befalling builders
daring to go where elves and hidden people traditionally tread.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, huldufolk are harmless, even gentle
beings,'' said Magnus H. Skarphedinsson, a schoolteacher and
self-described elf expert. ``But if you brutalize them, bad things
will happen. Perhaps only that your project will have big cost
overruns. But also you could fall from a disease. Or die. It can be
very dangerous to bother elves.''
</P>
<P>
   There are skeptics, of course, the National Museum's Bjornsson
among them: ``Hidden folk have provided a wonderful excuse for
clumsy workers: `I didn't wreck that bulldozer, boss, an elf did
it!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bjornsson, one of Iceland's foremost experts in folklore, called
himself a disbeliever, adding quickly: ``But not entirely, not 100
percent. It is hard to be totally scientific in a country as
spectacularly strange as ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Iceland was first settled in the late 9th Century A.D. by
Vikings from Norway and smaller numbers of Gaels from the British
Islands. They found an eerie, treeless wasteland still in the first
throes of creation _ with vast billows of steam hissing from
geothermal vents, volcanos spouting fire and new islets heaving
into existence off the boulder-strewn shores.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland remains a land in extraordinary natural flux. And its
prosperity is very recent: Until this century, most Icelanders were
impoverished sheep farmers or fishermen huddled in damp turf homes.
The population was regularly _ and heavily _ culled by famine,
plague and earth cataclysms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country seems custom-designed for superstition,'' said
Bjornsson. ``Such an extreme landscape inspires visions of the
supernatural. The everyday reality surrounding Icelanders would be
called hallucinations or nightmares anywhere else _ hot-water
geysers, molten rock, terrible earthquakes and the cold sea raging
all around. No wonder we have odd tales!''
</P>
<P>
   The rarely-seen races populating Iceland are said to include
elves, gnomes, light-fairies _ sisters to Tinkerbell _ dwarves,
lovelings (slender wee creatures inhabiting hedgerows) and mountain
spirits. Most of these have counterparts in the folklore of other
lands. But Iceland's huldufolk, or hidden people, are a unique
breed: Human-sized, highly-sociable beings dressed in colorful
costume, seeming to inhabit a sort of parallel universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes they will invite humans to their cliff homes for
a chat and pancakes,'' said Skarphedinsson.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, perhaps, there's been an attempt by some
entrepreneuring Icelanders to cash in on the elves. Tourist
agencies flog ``hidden world'' maps purporting to show locations of
elf homes. Guided tours of elfdom are also on offer. All this is
less troubling to folklore purists than attempts to revise
Iceland's spirit people to make them seem more correct and
wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   A prime example is what's become of the Yuletide Lads.
Originally, these 13 creatures were nasty sons of the ogress Gryla,
sent forth on dark winter nights to steal children for her stewpot.
Then, earlier in this century, they were downgraded to less scary
mischief-makers, leaving rotten potatoes in the shoes of bad
children at Christmastime, but ignoring the good.
</P>
<P>
   These days they are portrayed as rascally but cute gift-bringers
fitted out in wool coats and red caps, and soon to be celebrated on
Icelandic postage stamps. No more sneaking away with babies for mom
to devour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reykjavik retailers didn't want child-stealers associated with
the selling season,'' said Sigrun Halgrimmsdottir, herself a
shopkeeper. ``So we're stuck with 13 American-style Santas, except
they are a little sly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, truth is, no one takes these lads too seriously,'' she
said. ``Icelanders are too sophisticated for fairytales. We don't
need make-believe Santas when we have real-life elves and huldufolk
everywhere in our land.''

ABORTION FUROR IN ITALY OVER PREGNANT 13-YEAR-OLD RETARDED GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Teen-age pregnancies are no more unusual in Italy than
elsewhere. But the predicament of a 13-year-old retarded girl in
Sicily known only as Laura has fascinated the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a judge ruled that Laura's pregnancy should not be
ended by abortion. The judge's decision was sealed, and was
supposed to remain a secret shared only with Laura's parents and
the girl's guardian, but the news quickly leaked out.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Oreste Benzi, a local priest who led the battle to
overturn her state-appointed guardian's recommendation for an
abortion, was elated by the news, and called it ``a victory for
life.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Italians, especially those who support abortion
rights, viewed the case far differently. Valeria Ajovalasit,
president of Arcidonna, a feminist organization, told the ANSA news
agency Thursday night: ``There was too much noise around this
tragic event. A little silence would have been preferable, and
might have better served the interests of a little girl who has
serious problems and also of this unborn child.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura is the daughter of a retired farm worker and his wife, and
until recently lived with them and her grandmother in the small
town of Pozzallo. Her family doctor discovered she was pregnant a
few weeks ago. When the local child welfare services were alerted,
Laura was removed from her family until the father could be
identified, placed in a foster home run by a Roman Catholic
organization, and made a ward of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Social workers at first feared incest, but later the family
identified the father as a 14-year-old playmate, who is also
retarded.
</P>
<P>
   According to Giuseppe Privitera, a Pozzallo-based reporter for
Gazzetta Del Sud who interviewed the family, the girl's parents
wanted her to have an abortion, and fiercely opposed her removal
from their home.
</P>
<P>
   Laura's first-appointed guardian, Francesco Gugliotta,
commissioner of Pozzallo's social services department, had favored
letting his charge's pregnancy come to term. But late last week,
Gugliotta was replaced by the girl's family doctor, Ignazio
Ruffino.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffino told reporters, ``I know the condition of her physical
and mental health and I am certain that she is not capable of
understanding what is happening to her.'' He recommended that the
girl should have an a, calling it ``the lesser evil.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not reveal how advanced the pregnancy was and that
uncertainty may have influenced the court. The girl's mother has
said that the deadline for a legal abortion would fall sometime
before Christmas. .
</P>
<P>
   Under the law in Italy, where abortion has been legal since
1978, women may have an abortion without restriction during the
first three months of pregnancy. Second-trimester abortions are
allowed only if the fetus is found to be badly damaged or the life
of the mother is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffino's recommendation unleashed the fury of anti-abortion
groups, politicians and church leaders. The Rev. Gino Concetti, a
columnist for the Vatican daily newspaper, Osservatore Romano,
described the prospect of an abortion for Laura as ``the return of
the horrors of Nazi Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   That reaction provoked an equally strong one from abortion
rights activists and other commentators. Vincenzo Consolo, a
well-known Sicilian novelist, retorted, ``The church should
remember when it helped Nazis escape to South America after the
defeat of Germany before expressing itself so outrageously in a
tragic event.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the judge's decision, Benzi, who works with the
Pope John XXIII community, a Catholic charity that arranged Laura's
foster care, released a letter he said was written by Laura to the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Judge, I want my baby,'' the letter said.``Don't let my
baby die. Let my baby grow, I beg of you. Save me.''
</P>
<P>
   Benzi is a well-known abortion opponent, and his outspoken
advocacy has raised questions about whether the girl, who is
described as having the mental capacity of a 6-year-old, could have
written such a letter without help.
</P>
<P>
   The judge made her decision Thursday after interviewing the
child.

A CARTOON KING AT AGE 13
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Saturday, Dec. 18. Fact box below) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Reynolds is a typical 13-year-old kid _ you know, likes to
skateboard with his buds, plays soccer, used to dream of being a
basketball star.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yeah, he has a cartoon premiering Saturday on
Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   John, who lives in Simi Valley with his mom, Sandy, his brother,
Kyle, and a couple of pets, has had a thing for drawing comics
since he was 5. Little did he know that something so fun could earn
him money while he was in the seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   This is no ordinary kid-sized success story about a winning
contest entry. John's dad, Ray, is acquainted with Butch Hartman, a
producer at Nick's ``Oh Yeah! Cartoons!'' show. He sent some of
John's latest character illustrations to Hartman, just seeking some
professional feedback. Hartman was so impressed that he showed the
drawings to his boss, a deal was struck, and John Reynolds at age
12 was turning pro.
</P>
<P>
   John was asked to come up with a storyboard for a seven-minute
short, including the plot, additional characters and dialogue. He
accepted help from Hartman on some story elements and was given a
say in voice casting. Hartman polished the sketches and animated
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to watch the process without color, then with color and
without music,'' said John, who spent many Friday afternoons at the
Nicktoons Animation Studios in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Terry and Chris,'' about a 12-year-old boy and
the very unusual cockatiel he buys with his birthday money. The
bird was inspired by John's own pet, Petrie, with a healthy dose of
imagination thrown in. In the cartoon, Terry not only imitates
human voices he hears, his head morphs into the shape of the person
he mimics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know how I thought of that,'' John said with a
laugh. ``I thought he'd copy them, then I said, 'Why not make him
look like them?'''
</P>
<P>
   John says he decided on a career in cartooning about three years
ago, but his experience making ``Terry and Chris'' has firmed up
that goal. He made $5,000 on the job, a pittance for a year's work
in the life of a grown-up, but way more than he could have earned
mowing the neighbor's yard.
</P>
<P>
   With this credit under his belt, John probably has the most
impressive resume of any eighth-grader at Valley View Middle
School. But you won't find him reading the trades by a Beverly
Hills hotel pool, or doing lunch with agents anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   He has a pleasing degree of naivete in his voice when he talks
about the future of ``Terry and Chris'': ``We're going to see how
it does, if it gets a good rating or something, and then they may
want to make it a series.''
</P>
<P>
   He has hopes of doing another cartoon someday for Nickelodeon,
maybe ``Wrinkled Powerhouse,'' about a bunch of crime-fighting
grandmothers who nail bad guys by throwing their teeth or wigs at
them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reynolds sits in his small bedroom playing with
Petrie, pasting articles like this and other ``Terry and Chris''
mementos in a scrapbook, and transplanting new ideas from his
fertile imagination onto the blank pages of a sketchbook. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``Terry and Chris.'' &QL; 
What: An original cartoon created by 13-year-old John Reynolds of
Simi Valley. &QL; 
Where: Nickelodeon. &QL; 
When: 6 p.m. Saturday. &QL;

 &HT;    Holyfield's pastor ordered to give deposition Tuesday
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Evander Holyfield's preacher, Creflo Dollar, has been
ordered to give a deposition next week in the boxer's high-stakes
divorce case.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Holyfield's lawyers are tracing the ex-champion's
finances and say he may have given up to $7 million to Dollar's
church, World Changers Ministries in College Park. Fayette County
Superior Court Judge Ben Miller said Thursday that he's tired of
Dollar's efforts to evade the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears Pastor Dollar has placed himself above the law,''
Miller said Thursday. ``No citizen of this country is above the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller ordered that Dollar and his lawyers show up at 10:30 a.m.
Tuesday to answer questions from Janice Holyfield's lawyers. A
deposition is the testimony of a witness taken under oath in
preparation of a trial. Most depositions are taken in lawyers'
offices, but Miller said this one will be held inside the
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar did not appear Thursday at the hearing in Fayetteville.
His lawyer, Lecora Bowen, argued that Dollar should not be deposed
because of the separation of church and state, pastor-parishioner
privilege, several state laws and the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (a deposition) would require him to violate God's law,''
Bowen said, quoting 1 Corinthians 6:1.
</P>
<P>
   She said Dollar was in a touchy situation because he'd counseled
both Evander and Janice Holyfield. Bowen said John Mayoue, Janice
Holyfield's lawyer, has the information about donations to the
church from Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that some information about the Holyfields is indeed
privileged. For instance, conversations intended as confessional or
confidential can stay off the record, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue has said Evander Holyfield may have given up to $7
million to the church. Mayoue said he's determined that Holyfield
gave $403,000 to the church in 1998, yet donated $3.9 million to
the church in the 60 days before the ex-champ filed for divorce
last March 26. Mayoue said $3 million of that came in one check
five days before the divorce filing.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield also wrote checks for $150,000 to Dollar personally,
Mayoue said.
</P>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield's lawyer, Barry McGrough, said he didn't have
any problems with Dollar giving a deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he probably would find the minister in contempt
if he didn't show up Tuesday. ``I don't know if he thinks he is an
irresistible force,'' Miller said. ``If a conflict comes, I know
who will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Dollar is a leader in the ``prosperity gospel'' movement, which
teaches that God promises wealth and health to the faithful.
Holyfield is one of 20,000 members of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Miller also denied Bowen's motion that he recuse himself from
the Holyfield case. Miller has scheduled the divorce trial for
April 3.

 &HT;    Mother-daughter coming-of-age film showcases relative unknowns
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It happens too often to be pure chance,
two movies arriving with startlingly similar subjects and plots.
Maybe industrial espionage can explain the repetition of such
high-concept notions as volcano disaster pictures or animated bugs.
But what could be behind two nearly identical films about an
irresponsible, flirtatious mother and a level-headed daughter who
leave home, drive across country, move to California and muddle
through mom's bad choices for male companionship and daughter's
coming of age?
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for answers to the riddle, just accept serendipity
and enjoy. Maybe you can still find the Susan Sarandon-Natalie
Portman match-up of ``Anywhere But Here'' somewhere around, but
also seek out the touching bonding-though-tough-times tale,
``Tumbleweeds,'' featuring the also first-rate, though lesser box
office magnets Janet McTeer and Kimberly J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Who? Theater fans already know about McTeer, whose Tony
Award-winning Nora in ``A Doll's House'' stunned Broadway in 1997.
Brown also has impressive theater credits, especially considering
that she is 13. Regardless, they are actresses likely to establish
themselves in the public consciousness if their performances in
``Tumbleweeds'' is any indication.
</P>
<P>
   McTeer is magnetic as Mary Jo Walker, an attractive Southern
woman who is no longer young, who has a knack for attracting men,
but never the right kind. Her daughter Ava (named for Ava Gardner)
knows the pattern of flirtation to delusions of love to flaring
annoyance to stormy walkout so well she can predict the onset of
the next stage.
</P>
<P>
   When they have car trouble on the road west and Mary Jo begins
primping in the mirror when a truck driver named Jack stops to
offer help, Ava sees what is ahead and wearily admonishes her mom,
``Don't even think about it.'' But Mary Jo encounters Jack (played
by director/co-writer Gavin O'Connor) again in a bar in the
Southern California beach town where the two Walkers alight. She
beds him that night, they move in together soon after and find a
measure of happiness together. Briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Also brief is Mary Jo's office career, working for a crotchety
lecher (``Bonnie and Clyde'''s Michael J. Pollard, of all people).
Before she gets fed up there, Mary Jo and Ava are befriended by
co-worker Dan (Jay O. Sanders), a Shakespeare-spouter who is so
clearly Mr. Right he might as well wear a halo. Ava, you see, is
trying out for a role in a school production of ``Romeo and
Juliet'' and, with Dan's coaching, she wins a leading role _ Romeo.
When Ava also wins the attentions of a prospective boyfriend, Mary
Jo coaches her in the art of kissing, her own area of expertise.
</P>
<P>
   McTeer has a most expressive face and is not yet such a star
that she feels the need to protect how it is seen. As Mary Jo, she
gets an emotional workout, fast-forwarding through anger,
determination, exhaustion, coquettishness, passion, despair and
back again. One minute she is alluring, the next she is haggard and
plain. If ``Tumbleweeds'' were a studio picture, there would be
plenty of deserved Oscar talk about McTeer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Tumbleweeds'' is that other movie that's like
``Anywhere But Here'' and McTeer is that actress who plays a role
so similar to Sarandon's. Still, she and the film can stand on
their own.

PALESTINIANS WORRY THAT THEY MAY BE ECLIPSED BY ISRAELI-SYRIAN
TALKS

<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ After nearly four years of being the sole
Arab partner in peace talks with Israel, Palestinians are concerned
that they may be left in the dust as Prime Minister Ehud Barak goes
off in pursuit of Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see how the Americans deal with us in the coming
weeks,'' said Nabil Amr, a member of the Palestinian cabinet.
``Because they consider the Syrian track now as the most important
breakthrough in the peace process, they'll concentrate on reaching
a real achievement on the Syrian track. They'll send us messages
from time to time, but I'm not sure that they'll push as hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to allay those concerns, President Clinton made a point
of mentioning the Palestinian-Israeli talks as he stood between
Barak and the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, when they
began their meetings in the White House on Wednesday. Clinton
referred to the Palestinian talks again when the meetings ended
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also invited Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader,
to meet in Washington next month as Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators race to meet a Feb. 13 target date for a framework
agreement on a permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Washington, Barak contacted Arafat to
reassure him that he would not pursue talks with Syria at the
expense of the Palestinians, promising to meet the Palestinian
leader when he returns.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many Palestinians remain wary that the Israeli prime
minister might use the talks with Syria as a pretext to slow
progress and to squeeze more concessions from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a senior aide to Arafat, warned in a speech
on Wednesday against ``attempts to play one track off the other''
and urged a concerted stance with Syria that would ``plug all the
gaps in the Arab position through which attempts could be made to
avoid carrying out commitments on the Palestinian track.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some Palestinian officials said they sawages in the resumption of the Israeli-Syrian talks. They said
an Israeli agreement to withdraw entirely from the Golan Heights
and to remove Israeli settlements there could strengthen
Palestinian demands that the same apply to the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a precedent for us,'' said Ahmad Abdel Rahman,
secretary of the Palestinian cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Arafat, said that Syria's
entrance into peace talks would also help the Palestinian leader by
neutralizing opposition to his policies by militant Palestinian
factions based in Damascus and long backed by Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Saeb Erakat, a senior Palestinian negotiator with the Israelis,
said that neither side could afford to put their talks on the back
burner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the same street corner, in the same shop,'' he said.
``There is no comparison between the Palestinian track and the
other tracks. We are the core of the problem.''

 &HT;    DANGEROUS NEW STRAINS OF BACTERIA EMERGING IN AMERICA'S FOOD
SUPPLY
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Dec. 12
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY and ELLIOT JASPIN
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dangerous and sometimes deadly new strains of the
E.coli bacteria have emerged and are moving through America's food
supply undetected because no one is testing for them.
</P>
<P>
   Public attention and food safety efforts have focused on a
single strain, known by the scientific name O157:H7, since it
killed two children in the Jack-In-The-Box fast-food hamburger
outbreak in 1993. But the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta recently issued a report estimating that
O157:H7 may cause only half of the approximately 110,000 E. coli
illnesses in the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   The rest are caused by an estimated half dozen similar, though
not identical, toxin-secreting E. coli bacteria. Researchers don't
know how prevalent these dangerous forms of E. coli are. They also
do not know how many people in the United States may have died from
the new strains.
</P>
<P>
   But most agree that the toxin itself cannd in about 25
percent of the nation's ground beef.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists disagree over whether citizens should be alarmed by
that percentage. Some emphasize that many toxin-producing E. coli
bacteria have not been found to cause illness and the only way to
be truly safe is to cook meat thoroughly. But at least one
prominent E.coli expert argues that putting the toxin at the center
of health efforts is the wisest course.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, food safety experts in America have spotted
many of the virulent new strains of E.coli overseas. But they seem
to have been caught off guard when they spread here.
</P>
<P>
   That was illustrated last June when a little-noticed outbreak of
E. coli O111, a new strain, swept through a gathering of high
school drill team members in Denton, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At final count at least 132 people were infected, several were
hospitalized, and two had appendectomies at hospitals where doctors
groped for solutions to the riddle of why they couldn't find
O157:H7 in patients who so clearly had the symptoms of severe E.
coli poisoning. No one was killed in that outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Texas case represents the first confirmed major
outbreak of O111 in the United States, the presence of the bacteria
hardly comes as news to Nancy Rehker of Cleveland. In October 1998,
she spent seven horrifying days watching E. coli O111 consume her
7-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She died one week to the day after she got sick,'' said
Rehker, 41, who still is angry that health officials couldn't
figure out what had infected Lauren. ``Do you want to see her
autopsy? Do you want to see what it did to her? It ate her alive.''
</P>
<P>
   It took the CDC three weeks, long after Lauren had died, to
identify the bacteria that killed her. Doctors in Cleveland knew
they had a case of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), the devastating
side effect of E. coli infections that causes kidney failure. But
their tests found no trace of O157:H7.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the fatal illness listed on Lauren Rehker's death
certificate still reflects the erroneous guesswork on the cause:
Hemolytic uremic syndrome, but ``Not E. coli.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren's death and the Texas outbreak occurred despite warnings
to both the CDC and the U.S. Agriculture Department in 1996 that
the country was facing a greater E. coli threat than just O157:H7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been screaming about the non-O157 (strains) for years and
nobody listens,'' said Dr. David W.K. Acheson, who heads a
nationally-recognized research project on E. coli in Boston.
``There's not a lot of logic, that I can see, in looking for
O157.''
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials didn't return repeated phone
calls, made over several days, seeking comment for this story.
</P>
<P>
   Acheson was among a small group of doctors who began studying E.
coli in the 1980s when the normally harmless intestinal bacteria
began turning up as a common thread in illness in several
countries. Soon, the researchers realized that some strains of the
microscopic E. coli bacteria carried a gene that allowed them to
secrete a potentially lethal poison known as the Shiga toxin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical factor is the toxin, and it's the toxin that
makes people sick... the E. coli are not as critical as the toxin
itself,'' Acheson explained.
</P>
<P>
   Since those early days, scientists have identified approximately
50 different E. coli strains that produce the toxin, but ohandful appear to be as dangerous as O157:H7 and some seem not to
be a threat at all.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of the 1993 Jack-In-The-Box outbreak, the U.S.
Department of Agriculutre decided to declare the O157:H7 strain an
adulterant. That made it illegal for anyone to sell meat that had
tested positive for the pathogen. Acheson, who says the E. coli
bacteria evolve so rapidly it's foolish to think any of the Shiga
toxin-makers will remain harmless to humans, said he didn't think
that decision made sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it was screamingly obvious that any bug that was making
toxin had the potential of causing human disease,'' Acheson said.
``I started to make calls to people at USDA and saying 'Well, wait
a minute, why are you singling out O157?'''
</P>
<P>
   And even without the evolution of harmless strains, doctors
already knew about O111, which had caused outbreaks of severe
illness in Australia and Europe. Scientists in Canada had confirmed
that E. coli O26, yet another strain, was dangerous to people, too.
Acheson said the Agriculture Department told him it deferred to CDC
on issues of human disease, and that the CDC said it didn't have
enough evidence of a problem in the United States to cast a wider
net over E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, oh boy, you know we know they are causing disease
in Canada, Australia, Europe, (and) South America but not in the
United States,'' Acheson said, recalling his frustration. ``And
it's like 'Do these bugs need passports to come into the country
and we won't issue them?'''
</P>
<P>
   Acheson's attempts to get the attention of federal policy makers
failed in part because he could not prove that any of the other
strains of the bacteria were causing sickness in the U.S. But he
doesn't believe the lack of evidence is proof of anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line was the reason we weren't finding them in the
United States was not because they weren't here,'' Acheson said.
``It's because nobody was looking. And it was as simple as that.
The emphasis was on O157.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the CDC was at the time tracking other forms of
toxin-carrying E. coli both in the U.S. and overseas. But Dr. Paul
Mead, who heads the CDC's infectious disease unit, is not sure
there was enough information in 1996 to say non-O157:H7 posed a
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Mead said his agency now is developing a clearer sense of the
dangers of non-O157 E. coli, and Acheson agrees that CDC appears
more willing to recognize that potential. In 1997, Mead and a group
of colleagues questioned whether the decision to make O157 an
illegal substance in meat adequately addressed the potential for
other forms of E. coli poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have prevention measures decreased risk?'' Mead asked in a
scholarly journal. ``How much illness is due to (strains) other
than O157?''
</P>
<P>
   Then this year CDC used Acheson's data to make its ``best
guess'' that the 0157:H7 strain only is causing half the E. coli
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mead is not as convinced as Acheson that the mere
presence of the E. coli toxin is cause for alarm because not all
toxin-producing bacteria are dangerous to humans.
</P>
<P>
   This view is echoed by Dr. Michael Doyle, who is the director of
the Center for Food Quality Enhancement at the University of
Georgia in Athens. Doyle's research is funded largely by government
money, but corporations also contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said testing all beef for the toxin, which is Acheson's
preferred remedy, isn't a workable solution to catching dangerous
E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds good when you say it fast,'' he said. ``But if a
quarter of the ground beef supply is condemned, I'm not sure we
could afford to eat out. It's a matter of teasing out the strains
that are the pathogens.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said tests must be developed to sort through the
toxin-producing E. coli bacteria, and find only those strains that
also have the characteristics needed to colonize in the human gut
and cause sickness. He also advocates an ``across the board'' look
at farming and slaughtering procedures to find ways to control the
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   For Nancy Rehker, the relative dangers of different types of E.
coli hold no interest. She has become focused on learning all she
can about the strain that killed her daughter, and she has been
trying to spread the word to others. She still doesn't know exactly
where the bacteria came from, though it seems clear Lauren was
infected while traveling in Virginia and Maryland days before she
became sick.
</P>
<P>
   The diarrhea began shortly after they got home on Aug. 4. Before
very long it turned to blood. And then it wouldn't stop. That
night, Lauren drifted in and out of sleep with her head in her
mother's lap while sitting on the toilet. In the morning she was in
the hospital, and by the end of her life she was delirious, sucking
on the metal bed post.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren was in the grip of HUS. There is no cure, though it isn't
always fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in the world that will ever be able to erase
the memory of rocking Lauren, dead, and staring into the faces of
my family,'' she said in a letter.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rehker wants to know what's going to be done about the E.
coli nobody talks about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a government agency to protect our food, don't we?''
she said. ``They can't cure it, so they just have to stop it before
people get sick.''

 &HT;    Tough air-quality standards may conflict with Texas tastes
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush says Texans should consider
following California's lead in reducing air pollution from motor
vehicles, but automakers say the idea could put a crimp in Texas'
love affair with pickups and SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, under federal mandate to reduce air pollution by 2007, is
looking at various options to comply. Bush has suggested possibly
adopting California's limits on vehicle emissions that contribute
to smog.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the auto industry says that could limit
Texans' access to new trucks and sport-utility vehicles. That's
because the popular vehicles emit more pollutants than mid-sized
and small cars. California has a ceiling on the total emissions
that can be produced by vehicles in the state. If Texas adopted a
similar program, that could force automakers to reduce sales of
pickups and SUVs, which make up a greater share of the new car
market in Texas than California, the industry says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is the California program has the real
potential of limiting model choices,'' said Alan Weverstad of the
Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. He made his remarks to the
Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, which is
considering the idea as part of a sweeping set of proposals to make
Texas' air cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental and consumer activist Tom Smith accused automakers
of trying to avoid tough anti-pollution standards by scaring Texas
truck and SUV enthusiasts. Smith, who heads Public Citizen in
Texas, supports the California program for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said automakers haven't cut their
truck and SUV sales in California, and Texas officials doubt that
will happen here.
</P>
<P>
   But Weverstad said trucks and SUVs are far more popular in Texas
than they are in California or New York and Massachusetts, which
also have adopted California's emissions standards. He couldn't say
how many of Texas' more than 16.4 million vehicles are trucks and
SUVs, but added that it historically has been in the range of 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at the parking lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, has been criticized by state and national environmental
groups as having a poor record on pollution issues. In a letter
this week, Bush encouraged the environmental agency to consider
adopting California's vehicle emission standards. He said it would
``encourage the development of a new generation of cleaner vehicles
and fuels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked that the TNRCC consider adopting California's vehicle
emissions standard because the governor believes that the
California standard has a great deal of merit and we should give it
a great deal of consideration,'' Edwards said. ``He also encourages
people to comment on these proposals in the coming months.''
</P>
<P>
   The TNRCC approved a proposal Thursday to do just that,
scheduling public hearings on the issue for coming months. The
proposal is part of a package of ideas meant to get nearly all of
Texas in line with federal ozone pollution standards by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   That package includes changes to vehicle emission testing in the
12 counties around Dallas and around Houston; tighter restrictions
on pollution from cement and power plants; limits on the use of
commercial and industrial machinery and statewide restrictions on
pollution from water heaters. The commission scheduled public
hearings on these matters, including one in Austin on Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also adopted final rules governing pollution from
so-called grandfathered plants. Those power and industrial plants
weren't required to follow air quality standards adopted in the
1970s because they already were built or were in the middle of
construction. Owners of those plants now will be encouraged to
register with the state and reduce pollution. If they don't, they
will face substantial fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is to be allowed to opt out of participating (in
pollution reduction efforts).'' TNRCC Chairman Robert Huston said.
</P>
<P>
   Four areas in Texas _ Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston-Galveston,
Beaumont-Port Arthur and El Paso exceed federal standards for ozone
pollution. Other areas are considered near ``nonattainment,''
including the Austin area, which includes Travis, Williamson, Hays,
Bastrop and Caldwell counties.

SHUTTLE MISSION TO REPAIR HUBBLE TELESCOPE AGAIN DELAYED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The launch of the shuttle Discovery on a
much-delayed mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope was
postponed for a day Thursday so engineers could widen a search for
improperly welded components in the shuttle's fuel lines.
</P>
<P>
   The launch was reset for 8:47 p.m. EST Friday. Forecasters
predict a 60 percent probability of low clouds or rain during the
42-minute launch period.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has said it will postpone all efforts to launch the mission
until January if Discovery is not off the ground by Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's postponement forced shuttle managers to trim the
length of the flight from 10 to nine days. NASA has prohibited its
shuttles from flying over New Year's Eve and wants Discovery back
on the ground no later than Dec. 28 as a precaution against
so-called Y2K computer problems. However, it believes the
spacecraft faces no software issues.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter mission will permit the four lengthy spacewalks that
Discovery's crew plans to replace the Hubble's faltering gyroscopes
and make other repairs. The seven astronauts will give up a
scheduled off-duty day in orbit to preserve the spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is disappointing,'' said Ron Dittemore, NASA's shuttle
program manager, who has presided over eight setbacks since
Discovery was initially scheduled to liftoff in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   The latest issue arose late Tuesday when a California company
that supplies propellant lines for the shuttle's external fuel tank
alerted NASA that an improper metal alloy had been used to weld a
fuel line slated for use on a future mission.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, shuttle engineers worked quickly to review
X-rays of the welds on Discovery's fuel tank. They said Wednesday
night that Discovery's tank was OK.
</P>
<P>
   However, on Thursday shuttle contractors asked NASA for more
time to expand the analysis to the welds in a dozen steel alloy
propellant lines and other components within Discovery's tail
section, where the ship's three rocket engines are housed.
</P>
<P>
   Dittemore then called a halt to the countdown so engineers could
reassess 20-year-old records of the welding and inspection
procedures used in the fabrication of the 17-inch wide hydrogen and
oxygen lines and subassemblies in the engine compartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a hardware problem. What we have to do
is search over the paperwork to convince ourselves that this is not
an issue,'' said Dittemore. ``If this had happened two or three
days ago, it would be cleared up by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the shuttle's 15-story tall fuel tank, which is disposed
of after each launch, the components within Discovery's engine
compartment have already flown 26 previous missions dating back to
1984.
</P>
<P>
   Like its sister shuttle orbiters, Discovery was designed to fly
at least 100 missions.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's concern over the welds on the fuel tank were limited to
whether they could withstand the stresses of a single lift off.
With the components inside the shuttle, the concern expands to
whether the welds can withstand years of fatigue, Dittemore said.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle missions have been suspended since Columbia experienced
an electrical short moments after its late July lift off. The short
was traced to damaged electrical working in Columbia's fuselage.
The finding prompted the space agency to inspect and repair the
wiring on the shuttles, starting with Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, other problems with Discovery contributed to the
delays. The space agency has replaced a rocket engine, repaired
external cables and wiring, fixed a leaky hydraulic system and
replaced a dented fuel line.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomical observations with Hubble were halted Nov. 13 after
the fourth of the telescope's six gyroscopes malfunctioned. Without
at least three working gyros, the observatory cannot be aimed
precisely enough to study stars, galaxies and other distant objects
in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as frustrating today as it was yesterday and the day
before,'' NASA's Dave Leckrone, the Hubble's senior project
scientists, said of the latest setback. ``But you have to take the
long-term view. Another day or two will not make a huge difference
to us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider the possibilities of a scientific breakthrough that
could allow farmers to grow more food while using less pesticide,
or to produce cholesterol-free soybeans, or to add vitamins to
vegetable oils to prevent malnutrition. Maybe it could let some
plastic products now made from oil instead be produced from plants.
</P>
<P>
   Would the stock prices of companies developing such products
soar to Internet-style heights? Would the scientists be viewed as
potential saviors in a world where hunger and malnutrition are
realities for many millions, and where pollution from oil
refineries remains a problem?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to both questions is ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom in human history has a technology with such exciting
possibilities seemed less popular than genetic modification of
foods _ a k a ``Frankenstein foods'' in the British tabloids _ is
today. Wall Street is leery, and now class-action lawyers have
leaped in with a double-barreled suit accusing Monsanto, the
leading company in the field, of trying to monopolize a business
the lawyers say relies on foisting possibly dangerous foods on the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The way things are going, Monsanto executives who want to avoid
being harassed at cocktail parties and on airlines may take to
lying about what they do. Perhaps they'd do better if they claimed
to be from Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   How did we get to this point? One answer is that the industry's
lobbyists were too successful. They persuaded the Food and Drug
Administration that genetic modification _ which involves inserting
a gene into a plant _ was not very different from the old way of
breeding plants, and the corn or soybeans were equally nutritious.
So there was no need to call attention to it on labels.
</P>
<P>
   But because there was no need to reassure consumers, there was
also no need to educate them. The marketing efforts focused on
farmers and, as it happened, the early products did more for
farmers, with higher crop yields and resistance to pests, than for
consumers, in terms of improved nutrition. Farmers embraced the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Then the resistance arose, largely in Europe. Who can be
absolutely certain that these products will not have some bad
effect on animals, or plants, or the environment? Ask the question
that way, and the answer is that no one can. Ask whether the
evidently small risks offset the potential gains _ in nutrition and
in reducing pesticide use, among others _ and you might get a
different answer.
</P>
<P>
   Now European fears are being exported to an American public that
knows virtually nothing about the subject _ and is hearing about it
from people warning of dangers. Farmers are getting nervous about
planting the seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wall Street is putting pressure on Monsanto to spin
off its Searle pharmaceuticals business. James Wilbur, an analyst
at Salomon Smith Barney, figures that an independent Searle would
be worth about $38 a share. You can buy Searle, with the rest of
Monsanto thrown in, for less than $41 a share, which gives you some
idea just how happy investors are about agribusiness these days.
Since the end of 1997, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 is up 46 percent,
while Monsanto is down 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been better if Monsanto and its competitors had
insisted on _ rather than resisted _ putting labels on genetically
modified products. Perhaps they could have portrayed the labels as
indicating a superior product with environmental benefits. Instead,
they left the public education to the industry's foes. In
persuading regulators that no labels were needed, the lobbyists won
a pyrrhic victory.

EUROPEAN COURT SAYS BOYS CONVICTED OF MURDER DID NOT GET FAIR
TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The European Court of Human Rights ruled Thursday that
two 10-year-old boys who kidnapped and killed 2-year-old James
Bulger in a suburban Liverpool shopping center in 1993 had not
received a fair trial in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The judges said that the two boys, Jon Venables and Robert
Thompson, had been too young to take part effectively in a
procedure meant for adults and that the home secretary at the time,
Michael Howard, had erred in increasing their eight-year jail
sentence to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The boys have already served six years, and while the European
decision does not affect their convictions, it could be the basis
for lawyers to seek their release in British courts.
</P>
<P>
   The crime, committed on Feb. 12, 1993, generated horror and
revulsion among people around the world when still photos from
security camera videotapes were made public. Photos from the
shopping center showed an older boy calmly leading the toddler away
by the hand; stills from a construction company camera not far away
showed two youths beating him.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapping occurred while the child's mother was momentarily
distracted as she stood in line at a butcher shop in the commercial
arcade. The boy's mutilated body was found two days later by
children playing on a railroad embankment two miles from the
shopping center. He had been thrown onto the tracks from a bridge
and hit by a passing train.
</P>
<P>
   The age of James' tormentors, the methodical manner in which
they made off with him and the brutality of his killing provoked a
national debate in Britain over whether social neglect was making
both victims and victimizers of the country's young.
</P>
<P>
   In the House of Commons on Thursday afternoon, Jack Straw, the
current home secretary, said, ``This terrible case _ and not least
the image of that 2-year-old being led away to his death _
traumatized a generation of parents more than any other single
event of this decade.''
</P>
<P>
   The original minimum sentence of eight years set by the trial
judge was increased to 10 years by the lord chief justice at the
time and later to 15 by Howard. The law lords of the House of
Lords, England's highest court, threw out Howard's decision in
1997, and the government has since said that it would await the
European court's ruling before deciding what action to take in the
boys' continuing imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Straw told Parliament on Thursday that he needed time to
consider the 120-page ruling before acting in the case but that
overall reforms would now have to be made in the way juvenile
offenders are tried and sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the European Court of Human Rights, which is based
in Strasbourg, France, and operates entirely separately from the
European Union, is to ensure that countries that have signed the
international human rights convention live up to its terms. The
British government is in the process of incorporating the
convention into the law of the United Kingdom, meaning that future
complaints of violations can be taken up in British courts.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling Thursday, judges said that a home secretary's
involvement in fixing terms for young offenders violated the
convention's guarantee of the right to ``a fair hearing before an
independent and impartial tribunal.'' As a member of the
government, a home secretary is not independent of the executive,
it said.
</P>
<P>
   The boys, both 11 by the time of the 17-day trial, were the
youngest children in Britain to be tried for murder this century.
The European court said that the proceedings had breached their
rights because the bewildering atmosphere of an adult court
prevented them from taking a proper part in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, with its judicial formality and lawyers in robes and
wigs, must have seemed ``incomprehensible and intimidating'' to the
boys, the judges said.
</P>
<P>
   Practical modifications to take account of their youth _ like
raising the floor level of the criminal dock to allow them to see
the courtroom, and limiting the length of sessions to accommodate
their attention spans _ did not go far enough, the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the boys had skilled and experienced lawyers ``within
whispering distance,'' they would have been too cowed and shy to
talk to them freely, according to the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Proceedings against children must take into account ``age, level
of maturity and intellectual and emotional capacities.'' It might
be necessary, the judges added, to conduct such trials in private
to reduce the inhibiting effect of the surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   However, they ruled that the ``blaze'' of publicity connected to
the trial did not have such an impact on the boys as to constitute
``inhuman or degrading'' treatment, as the youths' lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
   James' mother, Denise Fergus, was said by her lawyer, Sean
Sexton, to be ``devastated'' by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``She feared the worst and always thought there was a danger of
this happening and that they were trying for the minimum
sentence,'' he said. ``She fears if they are let out, they might do
something similar again, and she will do anything she legitimately
can to stop this happening.''

AMERICAN SOLDIER KILLED IN KOSOVO BY LAND MINE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An American soldier in Kosovo died early Thursday
after his vehicle struck a land mine that may have been planted in
a recent act of sabotage, Pentagon officials said Thursday. His was
the first American death in NATO's peacekeeping operation in the
Serbian province not caused by an accident or suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is littered with mines, but officials said they suspected
that the mine that killed the soldier might have been placed
recently, because his vehicle was traveling on a road that had been
used regularly and was thus believed to be free of mines.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier, Staff Sgt. Joseph E. Suponcic, 26, was riding in an
Army Humvee when the mine detonated beneath it on Wednesday night
near Kosovska Kamenica in southeastern Kosovo. The village lies in
the part of the American zone that is regularly patrolled by
Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter flew Suponcic to a hospital at the main American
base in Kosovo, not far from Urosevac, but he died from his wounds
nearly five hours later, according to a statement by the
headquarters of the Army's European Command in Heidelberg, Germany.
The driver was slightly wounded.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear who might have laid the mine, the
officials said. Both Serbian forces and Kosovo Albanian rebels used
mines extensively during the civil war that ended with the
occupation of Kosovo by more than 40,000 NATO-led troops in June.
Since then, Kosovo has been riven by violent acts of retribution by
Albanians against Serbs and, less often, against the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The area around Kamenica saw little fighting during the war
between Serbian forces and Albanians fighting for the province's
independence. It is one of the few parts of Kosovo that still has a
significant population of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Both the remaining Serbs in Kosovo and Russian peacekeepers, who
are viewed as historical and cultural allies of Serbia, have been
the targets of attacks by Kosovar Albanians, possibly those
associated with the officially disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official said a mine planted in that area would
presumably be intended to harm Serbian civilians or Russian troops,
raising the possibility that it may have been laid by Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Suponcic, a member of the Third Battalion of the 10th Special
Forces (Airborne), based at Fort Carson, Colo., was assigned to the
American unit that serves as a liaison with the Russian
peacekeepers. He was one of few Americans working in that part of
the American sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said it was also
possible that a long-dormant mine could have been exposed by rain.
But he added that ``the circumstances are still under review.''
Bacon said that while other mines were believed to be on both sides
of the road, the mine that killed Suponcic was on the road itself.
</P>
<P>
   American commanders in Kosovo have begun an investigation to
determine who might have planted the mine.
</P>
<P>
   In the six months since the peacekeeping operation began, there
have been six other Americans killed in Kosovo and another in
Macedonia, but this was the first death caused by a hostile act,
the officials said. The others are believed to have been caused by
accidents or possible suicides.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and NATO suffered no combat casualties during
the 78-day air war over Serbia last spring. But two Army soldiers
died in a helicopter crash during a training mission in Albania.

SEN. KENNEDY SAYS NO ENDORSEMENT PLANNED, FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Little more than a month ago, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy told one
associate that he planned to endorse Vice President Al Gore. The
senator's aides, and Gore's too, have sent strong signals to the
same effect.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights ago in Nashville, top aides to Gore said Kennedy's
sought-after official blessing is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday Kennedy said that, right now, he has no plans to
endorse anyone. And if he does decide to back a candidate, Kennedy
added, he'll consider Sen. Bill Bradley as well as Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Given Bradley's unexpectedly strong challenge, was Kennedy
hedging his bets? Was it a case of Massachusetts' senior senator's
sometimes uncertain syntax? Or was Kennedy simply trying to
sidestep the issue so he wouldn't drain the drama and impact out of
an endorsement that has already been arranged?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his intent, Kennedy left the clear impression during an
interview with Globe editors and reporters that, like a lot of
rank-and-file Democrats, he's weighing his options in a contest
that has become quite competitive. Or perhaps, like a lot of fellow
officeholders, he thinks there's nothing to gain by choosing sides
in a contest with no assured outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy reinforced that impression by noting that Bradley has
become a ``serious candidate'' with growing appeal to the
electorate. And whether by design or omission, Kennedy didn't
volunteer much praise for Gore, except to say that, ``as gifted and
talented'' as Gore is, he's not very good on television.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to both Kennedy and Gore, asked to parse Kennedy's
remarks, said they believe that nothing much has changed; and that
the party's liberal icon is still likely to stand by Gore when the
moment is right.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was not that moment.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he plans to endorse Gore, Kennedy said he's giving it
some thought. ``But I have no current plans,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   After explaining how he's been preoccupied with Senate business
and his own reelection campaign, Kennedy said he just had not had
time to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean, he was asked, that he might not endorse either
man before the Feb. 1 N.H. primary?
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's reply: ``Might not. I'm going to give it some thought
over the holiday period.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, he explained, ``has sort of captured some of the
imagination of the public,'' citing the former New Jersey senator's
outsider image, his Rhodes scholar credentials and his basketball
career.
</P>
<P>
   In every pass at the topic of endorsements, the senator was
nothing if not uncertain:
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``At this moment, you don't plan to endorse in the
Democratic primaries?''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy: ``Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``If you do endorse, might you consider endorsing
Bradley?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to endorse, of course I'm going to consider both
candidates,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   One thing only was certain: Kennedy's determination Thursday to
leave all of his options open -- a Gore endorsement, no
endorsement, maybe even a Bradley endorsement. He even found some
good things to say about the two frontrunning Republicans, Sen.
John McCain and Texas Gov. George W. Bush. But of course no hint
that he might opt to support either one.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Kennedy departed, he called a Globe editor to add
a further thought on the endorsement issue. With the exception of
Massachusetts candidates Michael Dukakis and Paul Tsongas, Kennedy
said he has never endorsed a Democratic primary candidate before
the party convention.
</P>
<P>
   The convention will be gaveled to order in Los Angeles next Aug.
14.

PRICE OF PEACE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND SYRIA COULD RUN INTO BILLIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MIDEAST-TALKS, MIDEAST-ASSESS) 
(DW) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Peace is expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Any agreement reached in the Israel-Syria talks is certain to
entail huge costs _ to monitor security arrangements, to relocate
Israeli settlers and to bolster the Syrian economy. If the past is
any guide, the United States will bear the lion's share of the
burden.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's immediate challenge is to continue serving
as midwife in negotiations between Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria, scheduled to
resume on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the negotiations succeed _ and that is by no means
certain _ the president will have to present a multibillion-dollar
bill for peace to a bitterly riven Congress that lately has been
reluctant to grant Clinton political or budgetary victories. That
is likely to get worse in a presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   The president's position is complicated by Syria's record as a
haven for terrorists, its presence on Washington's list of nations
that tolerate large-scale narcotics traffic, and Clinton's
dwindling term in office. Clinton has criticized Congress for what
he calls growing isolationist sentiment, another factor that will
undercut his appeal for billions of dollars more in foreign aid to
bankroll reconciliation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The president, in a preview of arguments he would make for new
money to support an Israeli-Syrian accord, said that continuing
conflict in the Middle East is more expensive than peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``For we have learned from experience that tensions in the
region can escalate,'' Clinton said in a Rose Garden appearance
with Barak and al-Sharaa at the start of the negotiations on
Wednesday. ``And the escalations can lead into diplomatic,
financial and, ultimately, military involvement, far more costly
than even the costliest peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials refuse to discuss the potential level
of American financial support for a possible agreement between
Israel and Syria, saying such questions are speculative and
premature.
</P>
<P>
   The cost would probably far exceed the $1.8 billion price tag of
implementing the Wye River accords reached by Israel and the
Palestinians last November. Even that relatively modest sum was
hung up in Congress for weeks this fall in a battle over unrelated
issues in the appropriations bill for foreign aid and State
Department operations.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials and Middle East analysts estimated that the
immediate costs of a deal under which the Golan Heights would be
returned to Syria would be at least $15 billion _ and perhaps
several times that.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has provided $100 billion since 1979 to
support the peace deal between Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt and Menachem
Begin of Israel, worked out at Camp David under the auspices of
President Carter.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between Syria and Israel would entail different costs,
some higher and some lower. Part of the American commitment at Camp
David was an assurance that Israel's military would always maintain
a technological superiority over neighboring armies. The billions
in American aid and Israel's own technological prowess have given
Jerusalem a significant qualitative edge over any Arab state _ and
over virtually any combination of Arab states.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, American military aid following an accord with
Syria would focus more narrowly on creating a security buffer
between northern Israel and Syria, including sophisticated
monitoring systems. While these would be expensive, they would not
require the same level of spending as the 20-year effort to upgrade
Israel's land and air forces.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an Israel-Syria agreement would be a costly proposition,
and Congress would have to sign the checks. The bad blood between
the administration and the Republican-led Congress could make it a
tough fight for a lame-duck president.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of Middle East peace say that Clinton must involve
Congressional leaders early in the process if he wants to win their
support for large new appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a deal _ assuming there is a deal _ the only way
this is going to succeed is if both the administration and Congress
get behind this historic opportunity,'' said Howard Kohr, executive
director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
``Congress has to have some ownership of this issue. The
administration cannot go it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The price of ignoring Congress until late in the process was
dramatized for Clinton this fall when Congress rejected a global
treaty to ban nuclear testing. The White House and treaty
supporters did not consult with Republican leaders on the treaty
and had no idea of the depth of opposition until it was too late.
Clinton tried to delay a vote on the nuclear treaty but was dealt a
humiliating defeat by a well-organized Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has traditionally given bipartisan support for aid to
Israel, but Syria presents a different case. President Hafez
al-Assad has long been a leader of Arab hostility to Israel, and
many in Congress may be reluctant to reward him for an 11th-hour
conversion to the cause of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Any direct economic reward to Syria, therefore, would probably
have to come from Europe, Japan or the Arab world.

   Y2K-CZAR (Washington) _ People following the news on New Year's
weekend will likely see a lot of John Koskinen, the White House's
Y2K czar. But Koskinen hopes that once the weekend is over, few
Americans will remember his name. To him that would mean the United
States experienced relatively few Y2K-related problems. By JENNIFER

<P>
   Brett's 1997 charmer about a cute little hedgehog is freshly
packaged into a gift box with a stuffed toy hedgehog just in time
for the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   The story centrs on Hedgie, who crawls inside a sock that blows
off a clothesline. As the other animals poke fun at him, Hedgie
proudly proclaims that he's wearing a hat to keep warm in the snow.
Not a bad idea, they think. Soon the clothes line is stripped bare.
</P>
<P>
   Brett's colorful, realistic illustrations appeal to young
children. Her trademark border pictures add another layer of
meaning to the tale. For ages 2-5. &QL;

   ``FINGER PUPPET THEATER: THE THREE LITTLE PIGS'' &QL; 
Illustrated by Peter Stevenson (Scholastic, $13.95) &QL;

<P>
   What a great idea! Finger puppets, board books and fairy tales _
all wrapped up in one package. Scholastic's Finger Puppet Theater
series also includes Hansel and Gretel, Goldilocks and the Little
Red Riding Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Four finger puppet characters come with each story, which
children act out using the sturdy board book pages as a stage.
Lively text and amusing pictures carry the plots.
</P>
<P>
   Young imaginations will soar! For ages 3-7. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MORRIS'S DISAPPEARING BAG'' &QL; 
Rosemary Wells (Viking, $15.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Author of more than 60 children's books, Wells and her beloved
bunny Morris always are a hit. This tale begins on Christmas
morning. Morris' brother Victor gets a hockey outfit. His sister
Rose gets a beauty kit. His sister Betty gets a chemistry set.
Hands off, they say to Morris, who gets a teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   Then Morris discovers one last gift left under the tree, which
leads to much merriment. The adorable pictures of the bunny family
are funny and captivating. For ages 3-7. &QL;

 &HT;    Bush taps media outlets for access to Latino votes
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, hoping to win over
Latinos in his quest for the White House, is exporting the formula
that helped him capture 40 percent of their vote in Texas in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He's starting in Iowa, where the Jan. 24 caucus marks the formal
kick-off of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The state may have just 56,000 Latinos, but it provides a
relatively safe lab to test advertising and other strategies
designed to reach out to Latino voters. It's all part of a plan to
reach beyond the Latino CEOs that the Bush campaign has spent
months courting and appeal to the grass-roots in New York, Florida
and, most importantly for those counting electoral votes, in
California, where there are 2.3 million Latino voters.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the Latino population rose more than 35 percent in
the 1990s, according to census data. Hispanic voters are
concentrated in the five states packed with electoral votes: Texas,
California, Florida, New York and Illinois, reason enough for
politicians from both major parties to court them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials say they're looking to win every Latino
vote. They're searching for media outlets aimed at Latinos in
lily-white New Hampshire, home to the first primary on Feb. 1. (So
far, they haven't found any). And they're planning an advertising
strategy designed to reach Latinos in California, where voters go
the polls March 7.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio, Texas, ad man Lionel Sosa, media director of Bush's
1998 effort, is working on the current campaign. He said the
campaign is buying, ``all available Spanish media everywhere we
go.'' In Iowa, ads are running in one bilingual newspaper and two
Spanish-language newspapers, both weeklies, and a Spanish-language
radio station.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we find a part-time Spanish-language radio station
somewhere in Iowa, we're going to buy it,'' Sosa said. ``If we find
a bilingual or Spanish-language newspaper that's 12 pages and
publishes once a month, we're going to buy it. It's a front burner
priority and it'll be that way as we go through the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   California organizers are planning a major push in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get those messages out there in forms, radio,
TV. I think what you're going to start seeing is a lot more
outreach to many, many different types of people and types of
groups ...'' said Hector Barreto Jr., until recently chairman of
the influential Latin Business Association. ``There will be high
profile events, just like the one we did in September. We'll be
doing some fund-raising. We'll be getting some high-profile
endorsements ... We'll be kicking this off in January and just
continue to turn up the volume until the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has assiduously courted Latino CEOs with the help of Raul
Romero, a University of Texas Regent and Bush appointee heading the
campaign's effort to win support from the well-heeled executives.
Helping in California is Barreto and, in New York, Jose Fourquet, a
33-year-old Bush cash contributor who works at Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   In southern California alone, some 440,000 small business are
owned by Latinos, Barreto said. That's a statistic Bush quotes on
the campaign trail and one that tells Barreto there are votes and
money out there from untapped sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is calculated that three out of five new businesses being
started in Los Angeles are Latino-owned,'' Barreto said. ``Those
businesses are doing $50 billion in annual revenues. The
demographers think those numbers are going to double in the next
five years. It's an explosion. It's not this quaint new trend. A
lot of those companies are not on anybody's radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials say they don't categorize donors by
ethnicity so they can't say how much of the $60 million to $70
million they've raised comes from Latino contributors. But they
know that six of the 156 pioneers _ people who have raised at least
$100,000 for Bush _ are Latino. Another group of Latino supporters
is working on raising between $10,000 and $100,000, said Sonia
Colin-Martinez, a campaign spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bush met with about 40 of his ``American
Dreamers,'' first generation immigrants who gathered at the
governor's mansion for a private luncheon held to thank them for
their work on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to raise money,'' Romero said. ``Basically,
American Dreamers, the concept, the governor is very, very upbeat
about it. He feels that's the reason why a lot of us are here, to
fulfill the American Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Bush extends the unrelenting optimism he
aims at Anglos to Hispanic voters. He touts free trade and NAFTA,
saying that, ``family values don't stop at the Rio Grande.'' He
calls for higher educational standards for all students, regardless
of race, and talks about, ``the soft bigotry of low expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   He speaks Spanish (albeit limited, even some supporters say),
and visits inner-city neighborhoods usually left untraversed by
Republicans. This week, Bush's campaign sent out a press release
announcing the unveiling of the mansion's holiday decorations,
``comprised of colorful, Hispanic ornaments made by local Texas
artists.''
</P>
<P>
   But such ornamental outreach won't quell the challenges Bush
faces or criticism that his Latino outreach is only skin deep. This
week, the chairs of the House Census Task Force called on Bush to
provide a population count derived from statistical sampling should
he be elected president. Sampling is intended to remedy the chronic
undercounting of minorities. It is controversial because Democrats
expect that a more accurate count of black and Latino people will
help them when Congressional and legislative districts are redrawn,
while Republicans fear it will hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you stand with those who would deny minorities, children
and the poor fair representation and economic benefits for purely
partisan political reasons?'' asked the chairs, including Rep.
Charles Gonzalez, a San Antonio Democrat and member of the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush must first clear hurdles in California, where former
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson alienated Latinos with his
anti-immigration stances. Houston radio station owner Tom Castro, a
Democrat and Los Angeles native, said Latinos were, ``the pinata of
California politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro chairs the New America Alliance, a nonpartisan group
working to increase Latino political clout. Board members include
former San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros, a Democrat, and A.R.
``Tony'' Sanchez, a Laredo oil man and Bush supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush is successful and becomes president, I think there's a
fair chance the Republicans can fracture the Latino allegiance to
the Democratic party,'' Castro said. ``It could turn that fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hopes so. The Bush ads run in Spanish and English, he said,
because 60 percent of Latinos use both languages. And the message _
focused strongly on family, god, work, opportunity and
inclusiveness _ doesn't differ in substance from much from the,
``compassionate conservatism'' Bush touts before Anglo audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying, 'We're sending out engraved invitations through
the media because we want you at our party,' `` he said. ``You
know, Latinos don't crash parties, but if we're invited we go every
time. We bring the whole family and we stay a long, long time.''

RUN THE VCR: `OLIVE' SURE TO BECOME HOLIDAY CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of the Fox network and you don't necessarily think of
charming and endearing. Risque, yes. Irreverent, certainly.
Subversive, probably. Coarse, most likely.
</P>
<P>
   So, to find nary a crude moment in Friday night's Christmas
special, ``Olive, the Other Reindeer,'' is, well, stunning.
Executive producer Matt Groening, creator of ``The Simpsons'' and
``Futurama,'' calls it ``a Christmas show that adults and kids will
actually be able to stand to watch together.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. And you really don't have to stand. It's cute. It's
funny. And, in the grand tradition of ``Rocky and Bullwinkle,''
it's sly enough on one level to keep parents amused while the kids
are enjoying the basic cartoon. (There's even a quick tribute to
Frostbite Falls.)
</P>
<P>
   In a role designed for her timbre, Drew Barrymore gives
beautiful voice to Olive, the well-meaning dog who swings into
action when Santa tells the media he'll have to make do with ``all
of the other reindeer'' or maybe cancel deliveries altogether after
Blitzen is injured during a practice run. You might think Rudolph
could fill in, but we soon learn the whole Rudolph saga is just one
of those urban legends, like alligators in the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   So Olive, the dog, decides she's Olive, the other reindeer, and
sets out for the North Pole on a Mauvehound bus. Make sure the VCR
is running. There are plenty more sight gags like that, a la ``The
Simpsons,'' to keep you rewinding till Christmas Eve, such as the
``churn o' the century'' sale at Butters of the World.
</P>
<P>
   The special, based on the book by J. Otto Seibold and Vivian
Walsh, is essentially the Rudolph tale updated for the '90s, with
the key changes being the empowered-female character and the
enormous merchandising tie-in at Nordstrom stores across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Olive's nemesis is a disgruntled postman (voiced by Homer
Simpson himself, Dan Castellaneta), who hopes to keep Santa
grounded forever. Her biggest ally is a streetwise penguin (Joe
Pantoliano), who sells bogus Rolexes but has the savvy to get past
North Pole security. Olive meets other characters along the way,
including Blitzen's flight-challenged cousin, Schnitzel, and the
misunderstood Round John Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Parents looking for a gentle lesson in doing the right thing,
helping others and standing by one's friends might check out
``Olive.'' Most Christmas specials are easy to dismiss as seasonal
fluff, but good music, good writing and a good heart make ``Olive''
a good bet to become a classic.
</P>
<P>
   Olive, the Other Reindeer. One-hour animated Christmas special
about a dog who fills in for an injured reindeer on Christmas Eve.
Voices by Drew Barrymore, Dan Castellaneta and Joe Pantoliano.
Friday night on Fox. Parental guideline rating: TV-G.

BIG BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch
of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of
Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
was the winter of despair . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTIES'' &QL; 
Richard Avedon &QL; 
(Random House/Kodak, $75) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   It's my pleasure to tell you that Richard Avedon's new book,
``The Sixties,'' begins not with a photographic image but with the
opening paragraph of ``A Tale of Two Cities, words written 140
years ago but so remarkably suited to the edgy chaos of the 1960s
that you'll wonder whether Charles Dickens shared some funny
cigarettes with Abbie Hoffman in another life.
</P>
<P>
   Avedon and his collaborator, Doon Arbus, have put together a
book that shows the decade in all its abrasive and contradictory
glory. Notice the juxtaposition of Rose Kennedy and Janis Joplin
(at opposite ends of the book, each wearing her version of finery
and an eerie frown), Truman Capote displaying his belly button and
Andy Warhol his scars, the stiff stare of Henry Kissinger and the
serene gaze of Cesar Chavez. There's the requisite nudity _ female
breasts are outnumbered, for once, by male genitalia _ and every so
often a splash of color that reminds us that psychedelic was a
household word. It will make you squirm, and it will make you laugh
_ a '60s effect indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big books you might spend your money on this
Christmas season:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``ILLUSTRATED LETTERS: ARTISTS AND WRITERS CORRESPOND'' &QL; 
Edited by Roselyne de Ayala and Jean-Pierre Gueno (Abrams, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the art of the handwritten letter taken to grand
heights. The editors have gathered more than 60 letters written by
European artists and authors of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some
are just notes with doodles in the margins. Others are illustrated
with exquisite sketches and watercolor scenes. Among the generous
correspondents: Honore de Balzac, Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant,
Arthur Rimbaud, Auguste Rodin, Edouard Manet, Vincent van Gogh,
Paul Gaugin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Max Jacob
and Antoine de Saint-Exupery. With a foreword by Francine Prose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FAY'' &QL; 
William Wegman (Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've grown tired of Wegman's ubiquitous Weimaraners, this
book might pull you back into the fold. The text that accompanies
Wegman's photos of his beloved Fay Ray and her offspring, Battina
(who stayed on after Fay's other puppies went off to new homes),
reminds us that these were DOGS, that in addition to their work
with Wegman _ Fay, especially, knew how to hold a pose _ they
chased balls, hurled themselves into swimming pools, played in the
mud, mated, gave birth and changed their owner's life in ways not
just professional. If there's a dog lover on your Christmas list,
look here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WOMEN &QL; 
Annie Leibovitz, with an essay by Susan Sontag (Random House,
$75). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of women, celebrated and obscure. It begins with a
photograph of Leibovitz's mother, then moves on to farmers, maids,
astronauts, soldiers, battered wives, Supreme Court judges,
showgirls and bull riders. More familiar faces are those of
Elizabeth Taylor, architect Maya Lin, writers Eudora Welty and
Jamaica Kincaid, Yoko Ono, Susan Sarandon, Joni Mitchell, Serena
and Venus Williams, Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. It's
worth the price of admission just to see the kind gaze of the late
Osceola McCarty, who worked for 75 years as a Mississippi
washerwoman, then donated $150,000 that she'd saved over her
lifetime to establish a college scholarship for African-American
students in need. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ART OF THE MARKET &QL; 
Bob Tamarkin and Les Krantz (ST&AMP;C, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An illustrated history of American business as seen through its
stock certificates. The paper certificates that were proof of
ownership before the days of electronic trading are becoming
financial artifacts with a value of their own. From a terrier named
Prince, who appeared on certificates issued by Farmers Deposit
National Bank in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s (Prince's owner was
the bank president), to the nude woman on certificates for Playboy
Enterprises, Tamarkin and Krantz show how whimsical a marriage of
art and commerce can be. &QL; 
``AND THE CROWD GOES WILD'' &QL; 
Joe Garner (Sourcebooks, $49.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is not the book, which is nothing extraordinary,
but two CDs that offer broadcasts of some of the most memorable
moments in sports. Included are Lou Gehrig saying goodbye to
baseball; Bill Mazeroski's home run in the 1960 World Series; the
Green Bay Packers' win over Dallas in December 1967; Bob Beamon's
long jump in the 1968 Olympics; Secretariat's triumph in the Triple
Crown; the Borg-McEnroe match at Wimbledon in 1980; Tiger Woods'
triumph at the 1997 Masters; Michael Jordan's sixth NBA
championship; and the U.S. women's win in soccer's 1999 World Cup.
With a foreword by Hank Aaron, an afterword by Wayne Gretzky, and
narration by Bob Costas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``SNAKE'' &QL; 
Chris Mattison (DK, $29.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big, bold pictures of creatures you don't want to find under
your Christmas tree. There are more than 60 individual species from
all over the world in Mattison's ``gallery,'' with information
about environment, anatomy, reproduction, and hunting and feeding.
A starter for would-be herpetologists. &QL; 
``NORMAN ROCKWELL: PICTURES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE''  &QL; 
(Abrams, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you love the paintings of Norman Rockwell, you can come out
of the closet now. Critics and art historians who previously looked
down their noses at Rockwell are now celebrating his influence on
the American psyche. This book, published in conjunction with the
traveling exhibition of the same name, includes 80 of Rockwell's
paintings, as well as essays not only by curators and historians
but by Robert Coles and Rockwell's son, Peter. The paintings are
anecdotal and as familiar as your own memories. The essays at times
seem like a collective  &UR; mea culpa offered to a man long regarded as
a mere illustrator, and to the people who have admired him for
decades. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``AFRICAN CEREMONIES'' &QL; 
Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher &UR; Abrams, $150) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This slip-cased, two-volume set weighs 16 pounds, covers 26
countries and contains descriptions and photographs of more than 40
ceremonies, some of which will make you flinch just to think about
them. Spectacularly illustrated, it's the cornerstone of the
authors' effort to document vanishing tribal customs in Africa. &QL; 
``NEW YORK: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY'' &QL; 
Ric Burns and James Sanders &UR; (Knopf, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of strolling on the thin edge of
nothingness. A splattering of fiery particles cascades down from
the torches that the steel workers use for cutting 10-ton girders
in half and for lighting their cigarettes.'' That's how the ``New
York Times'' described the spectacular bravado of the men who built
the Empire State Building in 1930, one of the best stories in this
elegant companion volume to the public television documentary
written and directed by Burns. &QL; 
``EARLY DYLAN'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   It could break your heart, he looks so young and happy. So do
Joan Baez and Mary Travers and even Johnny Cash. They stay that way
within the confines of this slim book, unlike the aging Dylan we
see in Richard Avedon's ``The Sixties.'' This collection of
photographs is a slice of '60s life that skirts the flamboyance and
focuses on a handful of people, their friendships and their music.
With a short foreword by Arlo Guthrie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``YACHTING'S GOLDEN AGE'' &QL; 
Ed Holm (Knopf, $65) &QL;

   Here are more than 100 glass-plate images documenting yachting's
glory days, from 1880 to 1905. You don't have to know much about
sailing to see that these boats were extraordinary, each a
one-of-a-kind, handcrafted vessel with a unique personality. When
seen from across an expanse of water, they looked, Holm writes,
like ``a flight of giant migrating butterflies,'' their sails
swollen all out of proportion to the tiny crafts below. These
images were made by a handful of pioneering maritime photographers,
who used techniques developed in the years after the Civil War.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a city where snubbing is an advanced social sport,
Rosemary Harris is offering a master class in the form's more
refined elements that no climber (or actor) should miss.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons are being administered with serene majesty from the
stage of the Walter Kerr Theater, where Noel Coward's ``Waiting in
the Wings'' opened Thursday night, and there are few sights more
warming on Broadway at the moment than that of Ms. Harris being
chilly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris plays May Davenport, an actress who once ruled the
West End of London and is now the unofficial but uncontested queen
of the Wings, a genteel retirement home for ladies of the theater.
May, if one may be so presumptuous as to call her that, exudes that
very lofty graciousness common to members of the nobility.
</P>
<P>
   When she is offended, and she often has reason to be, she
expresses her displeasure with fractional shifts of her chin or her
eyebrows, delicate gestures that nonetheless register like
thunderclaps.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the unwelcome presence of a woman who, she believes,
betrayed her decades ago (played by Lauren Bacall, whose own
theatrical weapons are useless here), Ms. Harris' May treats her
adversary as if she were a missed lighting cue on opening night:
something to ignore and to rise above with aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   Who says a life in the theater doesn't prepare you for life
outside it? The great pleasure of Ms. Harris' performance in this
shaky but likable production of ``Wings,'' a 1960 play only now
receiving its Broadway premiere, is that it does indeed evoke a
whole existence spent before footlights. May Davenport's style of
acting may be seriously dated _ she's not above putting a wrist to
her forehead in a moment of distress _ but it definitely has its
uses. Royalty in exile she may be, but royalty May remains.
</P>
<P>
   Coward, who would have turned 100 this month, loved his
theatrical divas, women for whom the lines between onstage and off
were never clearly drawn. He began writing about (as well as for)
them in the 1920s with the wickedly funny ``Hay Fever,'' a work on
which Ms. Harris left her inimitable stamp in a 1985 revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wings,'' one of Coward's last completed plays, looks at the
same breed of exotic creatures in their waning years, when their
careers are behind them and death only a short distance ahead. It's
a gallant, affectionate and cripplingly contrived work, widely
dismissed in reviews as a weak, oversugared cup of tea when it
first opened in London four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the subsequent (and deserved) renaissance of Coward's
reputation, critical arguments have been made for ``Wings'' as a
neglected twilight masterpiece. Certainly, it is atypically infused
with mortal shadows and fears, but it is also as creaky as an
Edwardian melodrama, a work in which buried secrets and buried
hearts of gold are exhumed in carefully arranged confrontations.
Although it has charming examples of whimsical Coward banter, the
play can't be treated as a frolic. It is, in other words,
exceedingly difficult to pull off.
</P>
<P>
   The director Michael Langham's unsteady interpretation of
``Wings'' doesn't begin to smooth over the work's patchiness, but
the evening certainly isn't the disaster it was rumored to be
during its tryout in Boston. Even with extensive cuts and revisions
by Jeremy Sams, the play feels long in the telling. And Ms. Bacall,
the show's chief draw in recognizability, is simply miscast as Ms.
Harris' rival. Her consequent discomfort shows.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Wings'' provides a rare and welcome chance to see a
host of actresses over 60 demonstrating, with gratifying relish,
that they still have the wattage to light up a Broadway stage: such
estimable veterans as Rosemary Murphy, Elizabeth Wilson, Bette
Henritze and Helen Stenborg.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few of them convey, as Ms. Harris does, the very
particular show business legacies that Coward understood so well.
(Ms. Bacall, who is of course a fabled Hollywood siren, is
radioactive with nostalgic associations, but not of the sort
demanded here.)
</P>
<P>
   You're best off approaching the production as an erratically
entertaining variation on ``Stage Door,'' the 1936 Kaufman-Ferber
play about life in a theatrical boarding house. Here, too, an
assortment of self-dramatizing actresses squabble, comfort and face
off. The essential difference, of course, is that the actresses of
``Stage Door'' had futures; those in ``Wings'' have only their
pasts.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't as melancholy a spectacle as might be anticipated,
although Langham and Sams seem exasperatingly unwilling to strike a
sure tone. The evening begins with the interpolated scene of a
covered body on a stretcher being hustled through the parlor of the
Wings (designed with appropriately frayed coziness by Ray Klausen).
It's a jolting moment, never referred to in subsequent dialogue,
establishing expectations of a bold gallows humor the production
then fails to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in many ways, Coward's original script has been
softened, with the elimination of its most intensely dramatic
scenes: the discovery of a fire set by a delusionary resident
(gleefully played by Ms. Stenborg) and an onstage death. This
shifts the focus more pointedly to the friction between May and
Lotta Bainbridge (Ms. Bacall), an actress of comparable star status
and the latest arrival at the Wings.
</P>
<P>
   May and Lotta haven't spoken to each other in 30 years, for
reasons only gradually revealed, and what central plot ``Wings''
has involves the broaching of this silence and Lotta's adjustment
to her alien surroundings. Unfortunately, Ms. Bacall seems an
outsider here in ways that go beyond the script. There's an
aggressively American air of modernity about her that extends even
to her costumes (designed by Alvin Colt).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She also only rarely relaxes into her lines. She can neatly land
a Cowardesque zinger (``I'm positively bristling with olive
branches''), and she unbends charmingly in an impromptu dance
sequence. But there's an anxious sense of effort that comes not
from Lotta, but from the actress playing her. And the night I saw
``Wings,'' Ms. Bacall's unscripted reversal of pronouns in an
exchange with Ms. Harris had the audience wondering if it had
missed some bizarre turn of plot.
</P>
<P>
   Thank heaven Ms. Harris is on hand to give the evening its
essential core of sentiment. Not that she does it entirely alone.
In addition to the performers cited above, there is Patricia
Conolly, who captures exactly the wry pathos of a woman who never
outgrew ingenue status. And Helena Carroll feasts deliciously on
the lugubriousness of an Irish character actress who, as May
recalls with barbed insight, ``never played a scene the same way
twice.''
</P>
<P>
   One should also mention the redoubtable Dana Ivey, who portrays
the Wings' brusque but kindly superintendent with outsize military
gusto. And Simon Jones is effortlessly touching as her lieutenant,
a middle-aged boy of a man and, quite understandably, the pet of
the ladies in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's most poignant moments, however, belong to an actor
who is only briefly onstage. That's Barnard Hughes, the
Tony-winning star of ``Da,'' who here appears as Osgood Meeker, an
octogenarian swain to an (unseen) actress now nearing 100, with
whom he first fell in love as a stage door johnny 60-some years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Clutching a bouquet of violets like a religious offering and
speaking of times past with the solemn awe of a stage-struck youth,
Hughes' Osgood becomes the very embodiment of the singular,
enduring spell that a great stage actress can cast on her
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   When a young visitor to the Wings (Crista Moore) remarks that
the object of Osgood's affections was said to have not had much of
a voice, he answers with goosebump-making gravity, ``She hadn't
much of anything, really, except magic.'' Ms. Harris and Hughes
reassure us that such magic isn't only a thing of the past.

COMMENTARY: HOLD THE GLUTEN GRUEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A century ago, a writer named Paul Devinne published a novel
about a man who falls asleep in 1900 and wakes up in New York City
in the year 2000. Here's how the hero describes the area that's
currently my neighborhood:
</P>
<P>
   `` `Glorious' was the only word I could utter. As far as the
mammoth city extended, I saw only one huge garden, pierced here and
there by slender towers or giant cupolas ... Where in my time
Morningside Park lay, I saw a gigantic Statue of Liberty, standing
upon the great gold dome of a colossal building of vast extent and
classic style.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, we do have some nice new plantings in the street divider
by the Burger King. But we haven't quite gotten to Devinne's vision
of urban renewal. It's just as well; rents are high enough already.
</P>
<P>
   People falling asleep and waking up in the year 2000 was a very
big theme around 1900. It started with Edward Bellamy's ``Looking
Backward,'' one of the biggest best sellers of the era. Bellamy's
hero wakes up in an enlightened, egalitarian Boston in which the
state owns all the businesses. Each worker gets exactly the same
pay because everybody, from doctor to ditch digger, tries his or
her hardest. People eat in beautiful public dining rooms. They shop
at beautiful public stores, and the stuff they order arrives home
before they do.
</P>
<P>
   Readers fell in love with Bellamy's vision of a happy,
cooperative and extremely white-bread society of the future. They
formed Bellamy clubs to work on creating a utopia just like the one
he wrote about. The book also launched a raft of imitators, like
Devinne's ``Day of Prosperity,'' in which everybody lives in marble
hotels in what seems to be a state of perfect communism. In ``News
From Nowhere,'' the hero wakes up in a year 2000 London that's
become a paradisical medieval village. Salmon swim upstream in the
Thames.
</P>
<P>
   One of the endearing things about these novels is the way the
authors reorganize society to gratify their own particular little
obsessions. ``The Future Commonwealth'' gives a great deal of
attention to the efficient way travelers' luggage would be handled
in 2000 _ and boy, are we glad that author didn't live to see the
airports this weekend. In ``Utopia Achieved,'' the hero spends
about 70 pages describing the diet of the future. (Breakfast begins
with ``gluten gruel'' and creamed potato. Supper is zwieback,
cherry sauce and eggnog.) My favorite part of the Devinne book was
not the four-hour workday, but the fact that you could call up any
theater at 7 p.m. and get a ticket for the performance
</P>
<P>
   But the first thing you notice is the books' optimism, their
excitement about the future's possibilities. (Well, actually, the
first thing you notice is the awful writing. But the optimism would
be next.) A hundred years ago, people all around the country were
scribbling out their visions of what a good and just society would
look like, and how to get there. Why aren't we spending this
turn-of-the-millennium period working up utopian projections for
2100?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we're not into politics or societal self-improvement these
days. Maybe that Soviet experience has made us leery of anything
that looks like social planning. Or perhaps _ it's the holiday
season, let's be optimistic _ we're just a lot more respectful of
human differences. In all these utopias, uniformity was a given.
Bellamy has every single person in the year 2000 behaving like a
middle-class minister's son from Chicopee, Mass. In ``The Ideal
City,'' New Orleans is voluntarily segregated by happy black
residents who enjoy keeping to themselves when they aren't doing
the white citizens' grunge work. Written by a doctor, ``The Ideal
City'' also has a general practitioner's view of the perfect
society, in which the whole world is obsessed with hygiene. There
are almost no traffic accidents because the streets are all
one-way. Public kitchens provide everybody with exactly the same
super-nutritious meal three times a day, and ``no one thinks of
demanding a variety merely to satisfy taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle-class Americans at the turn of the last century were
unhinged by the huge influx of immigrants and labor unrest. They
wanted the world to move forward in order to make it more like the
homogeneous small-town America of the past. We're smarter, at
least, in understanding that utopia ought to be an equal-rights
community. And it definitely would not serve zwieback for
breakfast.

EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE SAID TO BLOCK CRAVING FOR NICOTINE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists say they have devised a vaccine that blocks nicotine
from entering the brain, raising the prospect of a novel way to
help smokers quit.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental vaccine has been tested so far only in
laboratory rats, but a government-sponsored study shows it reduced
the amount of nicotine entering the animals' brains by almost
two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant, scientists say, the vaccine blocked nicotine's
effect in raising blood pressure and it prevented hyperactive
behavior that researchers see when they inject the animals with
nicotine, the addictive ingredient in tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that ``vaccinated persons would not be able to get
a `kick' from the nicotine in tobacco smoke or chewing tobacco,''
Dr. Alan I. Leshner, director of the National Institute on Drug
Abuse in Bethesda, Md., which funded the research, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Human trials of the vaccine are planned within two years.
</P>
<P>
   Federal health officials hope nicotine immunization will be
among the first of several vaccines against addiction. Also in
early stages are vaccines against cocaine, methamphetamine, and
PCP, an anesthetic drug called phencycladine that is often abused.
Leshner said the cocaine vaccine is closest to human trials.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of an anti-nicotine vaccine, Leshner said, is
``tremendous'' because smoking remains ``one of the biggest public
health problems in this country, and we need to have as many
treatment approaches as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Although overall smoking rates have declined, an estimated 60
million Americans still smoke cigarettes, according to the drug
abuse institute. Among adults between the ages of 18 and 25, the
smoking rate has steadily crept upward in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional vaccines are designed to stimulate the production of
antibodies against infectious organisms, such as polio or hepatitis
virus. The idea of immunizing against addictive substances
represents ``a very new and different use for a vaccine,'' said Dr.
Paul Pentel of Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Pentel is a coauthor of the new study on a nicotine vaccine,
which appears in the journal Pharmacology, Biochemistry and
Behavior. &UR;  &LR; The researchers who conducted the study are associated
with the Minneapolis Medical Research Foundation and Hennepin
County Medical Center; the University of Houston-Clear Lake; and
Nabi, a pharmaceutical firm based in Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Although nicotine, like a virus, is foreign to the body, it is
too small a molecule to be recognized by the immune system, Pentel
said. To make a vaccine, researchers at a Florida-based company
called Nabi Pharmaceuticals attached nicotine to a protein derived
from the outer coat of a bacterium. That enabled the immune system
to make antibodies to the nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers later injected regular nicotine into the lab
rats, the vaccine-induced antibodies attached to it and prevented
it from passing into the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine has so far produced no obvious harmful effects in
laboratory animals. Because antibodies are generally not able to
pass through a natural barrier that shields the brain from large
molecules, the vaccine-induced antibodies bind to nicotine outside
the brain and ``presumably would not disrupt other behaviors and
brain functions,'' Pentel said.
</P>
<P>
   Most existing treatments for drug abuse act on brain receptors
or neurotransmitters, the chemicals that allow brain cells to
communicate with each other. This can create side effects that
presumably a vaccine may avoid.
</P>
<P>
   A nicotine vaccine would most likely be used to help smokers
quit the habit, although Pentel said it might be used to immunize
people at high risk of nicotine addiction, such as teenagers who
have just started to smoke.

RAYTHEON VOWS HIKE IN HIRING OF MINORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. has pledged to increase minority hiring following
meetings with the Rev. Jesse Jackson throughout this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a onetime presidential candidate, has also recently
begun discussions with executives at State Street Corp. as part of
an effort to promote minority employment and improve access to
capital for minority-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson calls his effort the Wall Street Project, and its
director, Cheechee Williams, said Thursday she doesn't have
specific complaints about the treatment of women and minorities at
Raytheon, the country's third-largest defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``Traditionally the (aerospace) industry and the
company have been pretty much a white-male bastion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just happened that once we started talking to them, they
started looking at what more they could do,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings with Raytheon began last winter, she said, and
since then Raytheon named William Spivey of Lucent Technologies to
its 14-member board of directors, its first African-American
member.
</P>
<P>
   That appointment was ``already in the works'' before the talks
with Jackson began, said Raytheon spokesman David Polk. But
Raytheon agreed to hire more minorities, and to steer more work
managing its pension funds to minority-owned firms, ``as an
extension of our diversity efforts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective, it is critical for a high-performing
work force to be inclusive,'' Polk said.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a civil arbitrator ruled that a Virginia-based
Raytheon unit discriminated against a group of women involved in
work to dismantle old Soviet weapons _ a charge Raytheon, based in
Lexington, Mass., denies.
</P>
<P>
   But Raytheon has also undergone management shuffles lately,
particularly in the past year, under new chief executive Daniel
Burnham. BankBoston's representative on Raytheon's board is now
Henrique de Campos Meirelles, from Brazil. The Raytheon board's
only female member, Barbara Barrett, was also named this year.
</P>
<P>
   Polk wasn't able to provide the exact percentage of blacks and
other minorities in the company's work force, but he noted the
company was also bound to meet certain targets for hiring and for
contract assignments under the terms of its many federal contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are ongoing between Jackson's group and Raytheon, and the
two say they expect to announce specifics at a conference set for
next month in New York.
</P>
<P>
   That conference will be organized with the help of State Street
Corp., which Williams said was approached because of its large
pension management business.
</P>
<P>
   State Street in recent years has talked up its cooperation with
minority-owned brokerage firms, and last year helped organize a
Federal Reserve conference on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   In ongoing talks with Jackson and his deputies, State Street is
reviewing the capital requirements it sets to do business with such
firms. ``The question was, are we looking at the right levels?
That's what's under review,'' said Marshall Carter, State Street's
chief executive and chairman. State Street has also been the
subject of discrimination complaints by several women in recent
years, but the firm's employment practices are not at issue, both
Carter and Williams said.

UN LACKED `POLITICAL WILL' TO STOP MASSACRE, PANEL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The United Nations ignored repeated warnings of an
impending massacre in Rwanda in 1994, paving the way for an orgy of
ethnic killing that left 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu dead in
less than 100 days, an independent panel reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community did not prevent the genocide, nor
did it stop the killing once the genocide had begun,'' said the
report. This stemmed from a ``lack of resources and political
will'' before and after the massacre of Tutsis by the minority
Hutus began on April 6, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, who was then head of UN
peacekeeping forces, the United States, and Belgium all bear some
responsibility for failing to stop the genocide, the investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report suggested that the United States put controlling the
cost of peacekeeping operations above saving lives and accused
Belgium of pulling its peacekeeping troops out too quickly _ at one
point abandoning 2,000 people in a technical school and leaving
many of them to be murdered.
</P>
<P>
   The findings marked the second time in two months that the UN
has acknowledged failing to stop mass killings that could have been
prevented. In an internal report in October, the UN accepted blame
for the massacre of thousands of Bosnian Moslem men in 1995 in
Srebrenica, Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both reports _ my own on Srebrenica, and that of the
independent inquiry on Rwanda _ reflect a profound determination to
present the truth about these calamities,'' Annan said Thursday in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Annan requested the inquiry into the Rwanda massacre last March.
The panel, which began work in June, was headed by former Swedish
Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, former South Korean Foreign
Minister Han Sung-Joo, and Nigerian Major General Rufus Kuolati.
</P>
<P>
   Their 58-page report said the mandate the Security Council gave
the UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda was inadequate and its rules of
engagement unclear. It said UN officials, including Annan, failed
to act after receiving direct evidence of a carefully planned
genocide, and former UN chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali did not inform
the Security Council of the information.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, Annan admitted that the UN stood by
during a genocide the ``purest and most evil form.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us must bitterly regret that we did not do more to
prevent it. There was a United Nations force in the country at the
time, but it was neither mandated nor equipped for the kind of
forceful action which would have been needed to prevent or halt the
genocide. On behalf of the United Nations, I acknowledge this
failure and express my deep remorse.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's statement was criticized by some diplomats and human
rights officials as falling short of the ``clear apology'' to the
Rwandan people that the report demanded.
</P>
<P>
   But Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said, ``The word `remorse'
is stronger than sorry.'' Annan has not considered resigning or
disciplining any UN officials involved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report singled out Annan for failing to act on numerous
cables sent to New York by Canadian Brig. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, head
of the UN peacekeeping mission in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   As early as November 1993, Dallaire asked that the rules of
engagement be broadened to allow UN peacekeepers to use force to
stop ethnically motivated crimes. ``Headquarters never responded
formally to the force commander's request for approval,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 11, 1994, Dallaire sent a cable citing an informant who
had brought the UN details of a trained militia of 1,700 Hutus who
were prepared to kill up to 1,000 Tutsi in 20 minutes in the
capital, Kigali. Annan did not alert Boutros-Ghali to the cable,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Later the same day, Annan overruled a request by Dallaire to use
``overwhelming force'' to prevent the planned attacks, saying such
a step was beyond the Security Council's mandate.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Annan shares the blame with other UN officials,
the Security Council, and the US government. During a trip to
Rwanda last year, President Clinton apologized for Washington's
failure to act. He has cited the Rwandan bloodbath as one reason he
backed NATO's intervention on behalf of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   One European diplomat criticized the report, however, saying it
``does not take into account is the context of the times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of public reaction to the fiasco in Somalia,''
added the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 US servicemen were killed and one dragged through the
dusty roads of Mogadishu in 1993, the American public and Congress
soured on UN peacekeeping efforts. In May 1994, a month after the
Rwanda massacres began, President Clinton issued a directive
putting strict conditions on US support for UN peacekeeping, with
an emphasis on keeping down the costs.
</P>
<P>
   This led to a reduction in the size of the UN force as the
killings got under &UR;  &LR; way. ``It will always be difficult to explain
why the United Nations decided to reduce the troops from 2,500 to a
minimum force once the genocide started, and increase the numbers
to 5,500 when the genocide was over,'' said Carlsson, who headed
the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended that the secretary-general develop a plan
to prevent future genocide by giving all peacekeeping operations
authorization to use force to ``prevent acts of genocide or gross
violations of human rights wherever they may occur.'' Annan is
planning a new set of initiatives on humanitarian intervention,
Eckhard said.

 &HT;    Traditional Christmas Eve meal overflows with food
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _In Latin homes across South Florida,
there's no waiting for the big Christmas dinner _ it's on Christmas
Eve, or Nochebuena.
</P>
<P>
   With many variations, Cubans, Spaniards, Puerto Ricans and
Mexicans celebrate the birth of Christ on Dec. 24 with a lavish
feast of symbolic and traditional regional dishes, games and music,
and Midnight Mass _ Misa del Gallo.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Isasi, owner of Casa Gabriel in West Palm Beach, will
celebrate Nochebuena as he did in Jovellanos, Cuba, as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year the feast moved _ from friends' to families'
houses. We'd always have a big crowd, 20 to 50 people or more,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The meal begins Dec. 23, with the men cooking the pig, usually
outside on a spit or in the ground. It roasts almost all night, and
must be watched during the cooking. ``It's a great excuse to play
dominoes and drink beer,'' Isasi said, laughing. The women,
meanwhile, are preparing the rest of the food in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then about 7 o'clock on Christmas Eve, the families and
friends gather and we put all the foods out and everybody eats.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the roast pig, ``there's a turkey _ even in Cuba.
That's because some of the old people can't eat the pig, so we have
a turkey. There's boiled yuca with mojo (garlic and citrus sauce).
Two kinds of black beans _ the moros, which is the black beans
mixed with rice, and then plain black beans served with plain rice.
Cuban tamales are different from Mexican tamales. Ours are made
with fresh corn, not the dried masa harina. They're filled always
with pork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salads have avocado and lettuce and onion, and have radishes _
that's a tradition. We also serve membrillo, (a fruit paste
traditionally made of quince) and cheeses. And preserved orange
rind and grapefruit and papayas in heavy syrup with cream cheese,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bunuelos, a fried pastry made with sweet potatoes and squash, is
drizzled with a sugar syrup flavored with a cinnamon stick. The
dough is twisted into a figure eight or pretzel shape; a
traditional Christian symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my favorite, the turron _ almond candied nougat and pastes
imported from Spain. These are always served at Christmas time. We
have them year round now, but when I was a child, only at
Christmas. They are imported _ we don't grow almonds in Cuba,''
Isasi said.
</P>
<P>
   Some families, he said, serve plantains and flan and maybe a
fish dish; the menu can vary according to family preference and the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we eat all night long, the feast goes on and on. The
musicians come and play, with guitars, and they go singing from
house to house. You give them some money.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meal, the men retire with their cafe Cubano (Cuban
coffees), often spiked with anisette or brandy, and puros _ Havana
cigars; women clean up. There are no gifts exchanged; that takes
place on Three Kings Day _ January 6, he said. ``And it's just for
the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholic families may wait to eat until after Midnight Mass, for
which some fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's mostly a feast day, the biggest feast of the year,''
Isasi said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Latin countries celebrate the same way, with huge meals
and perhaps the largest family gathering of the year, but with
slightly different foods.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans serve a turkey with mole sauce, green chili and instead
of the buneulos, they serve sopaipillas _ a variation of the fried
dough that forms a crispy pillow into which honey is poured.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish include baked red cabbage with apples, almond soup,
red snapper and fried turnovers called bollinas. Their meal is
served in several courses and typically begins with nuts and
cheese, then soup and roast chicken. The dessert is a brazo gitano,
a cream-filled sponge cake covered with a sherry syrup and topped
with meringue.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans include vianda, assorted boiled roots and arroz
con gandules (rice with pigeon peas) in their Nochebuena meal. A
paranda, a pick-up musical band of serenaders, travels from house
to house, sometimes into the wee hours.

ISRAEL, SYRIA AGREE TO ANOTHER ROUND OF HISTORIC PEACE TALKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa agreed Thursday to continue their
peace talks in the Virginia countryside Jan. 3 as they wrapped up
two days of White House discussions mediated by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement before the two men left Washington, Clinton
sounded a hopeful note that the next round of talks may finally
yield the framework for a long-sought comprehensive Middle East
peace settlement, which has been so illusive over the 51 years
since the state of Israel was created, setting off a series of
Arab-Israeli conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past 48 hours Israel and Syria have taken a critical
step in the journey toward peace. With courage and perseverance on
both sides, the result will be deeply rewarding to the people of
Israel and to the people of Syria,'' Clinton said at the conclusion
of the first ever high-level talks between the two long-time
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   He called their discussions, which took place at Blair House
across Pennsylvania Avenue from the presidential mansion, ``a new
beginning.'' But he acknowledged that ``the journey will be
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Barak nor al-Sharaa spoke after Clinton's brief remarks,
nor did they shake hands when encouraged to by photographers and
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declined to provide any details about the talks that
began Wednesday or what the outline for negotiations would be when
they continue at as yet undetermined location in northern Virginia
just outside Washington. But he said the two men agreed ``to take
steps to ensure that these negotiations will be conducted in a
productive and positive atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters a short time later, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said both sides had agreed to do what they can
to rein in terrorist activities that might disrupt negotiations.
White House National Security Adviser Sandy Berger also indicated
that al-Sharaa had promised that Syria would ``use its influence''
in helping to control the activities in Lebanon of the militant
Arab group Hezbollah, which engages Israeli forces almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ... spoke about the necessity of reining in those forces
that create terrorist activities,'' Albright said, adding that
Barak and al-Sharaa understand ``the importance of doing everything
possible not to let terrorism disrupt what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   She called the commitments an important part of the
``confidence-building measures'' needed to reinforce the decision
by Israel and Syria to revive the peace negotiations that broke off
between them four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was no handshake between Barak and al-Sharaa,
Albright said ``the bottom line'' in their two days of talks was
that both men demonstrated ``real movement'' toward establishing
more friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spoke about each other as partners and neighbors. And so
that leads me to believe that despite the difficulties, which we
all know will exist, it does make me believe that this can be
done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Syrian officials characterized the talks as
constructive, adding that both men were satisfied with the progress
made and had agreed to do what they can to help sell a peace
agreement to their people.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, said one Israeli official, also asked al-Sharaa for
``some signs'' from Syria as the negotiations move forward that
Israel's security concerns will be adequately addressed in any
final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Knesset, Israel's parliament, signaled its support
for the talks in a vote last week, Barak is still under pressure
not to sign on to any deal that will return all of the Golan
Heights territory captured from Syria during the 1967 Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is demanding the return of the Golan Heights to its
pre-1967 boundaries, which would mean that some 18,000 Israeli
settlers would be forced to leave the territory now controlled by
the Israeli military.
</P>
<P>
   In her briefing for reporters, Albright said that ``all the
issues'' between the nations would be ``on the table,'' including
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, mutual security
concerns, a timetable for fulfilling all the terms of an agreement,
and anything else necessary to normalize relations and establish a
peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
   She said Barak and al-Sharaa had demonstrated ``a very clear
determination'' to reach an agreement sometime next year before
Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's characterization of the talks as ``friendly'' at
times seemed to belie the rocky start Wednesday when al-Sharaa
surprised and angered Clinton and Barak by criticizing at length
the Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton did not mention the remarks specifically in his
brief statement Thursday, he noted rather pointedly that the two
sides had ``agreed that there should be no looking back'' as
negotiations proceed.
</P>
<P>
   One administration official said Clinton secured a promise from
both sides to refrain from making ``inflammatory'' statements that
could disrupt the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The White House talks were not expected to yield a breakthrough
leading to an immediate deal ending more than 50 years of
Arab-Israeli hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton did get what he had hoped for, which was a general
framework for continuing negotiations early next year that could
lead to an agreement ending the last remaining dispute between
Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis, beginning with the Camp David Accords in 1978
spearheaded by then-President Carter, have settled their
differences with Egypt and Jordan, and is now engaged in working
out the final details of a peace arrangement with the Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza. A deal with Syria would finally yield
the comprehensive peace between the Arabs and Israel that has so
elusive since the creation of the Jewish state in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   If such an agreement emerges, Clinton would deserve a large
share of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart denied, however, that
Clinton is pushing for an agreement before he leaves office Jan.
20, 2001. He bristled at a reporter's suggestion that Clinton's
motives may be driven by his desire to enhance his legacy, which
may be noted more for the Monica Lewinsky affair than anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president believes we're at a historic moment
right now. That's what the president's focus is,'' Lockhart said.
``There's pressure to take advantage of this opportunity now and
not to squander it, and (it has) nothing to do with the president's
own time or tenure in office.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright also emphasized the importance of seizing the moment,
insisting that the isolation and news blackout of negotiations next
month will increase the odds for success.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia meetings will be modeled after the Wye River
sessions that produced an agreement between Israel and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat. There were few public briefings and no access
for reporters during the course of those talks.

BRADLEY, MCCAIN ON COMMON GROUND IN DISDAIN FOR `SOFT MONEY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, N.H. _ Meeting at the site of a famous but ultimately
fruitless political agreement, Bill Bradley and John McCain
Thursday shook hands on a promise they hope will set them apart
from the political pack: A ban on unregulated ``soft money'' in
their presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that money is eating away at the core of our
democracy like acid eats away at cloth, and it's time for us to do
something about it,'' said Bradley, the former Democratic senator
from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual cross-party alliance between Democrat Bradley and
Republican McCain was designed to highlight both candidates'
commitment to change the way campaigns are financed. But it also
served to spotlight their willingness to go against the grain _
displaying an independent streak that may appeal to the crucial
constituency of Independent voters in New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation primary. Opinion polls suggest that both men
are admired by many Independents, who are free, under state law, to
vote in either party primary.
</P>
<P>
   The handshake took place in the backyard of the Earl Bourden
Senior Center, on the same spot where President Clinton and former
Speaker Newt Gingrich came together June 11, 1995 and agreed to
appoint a blue-ribbon commission to examine campaign finance laws.
The commission never materialized and almost five years later, the
law remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the temperature in this crumbling old mill
town was in the 30s, both men were wearing heavy wool coats, and
their breath was visible in the air. With the 2000 presidential
race in full motion, McCain and Bradley took turns lambasting the
other's rival, as well as answering questions from about 50 voters.
The event was hosted by Ted Koppel and aired Thursday night on
ABC's Nightline.
</P>
<P>
   McCain ruthlessly mocked Vice President Al Gore for raising
money for the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign in a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``In case you missed it,'' McCain said of the temple event. ``He
said he didn't know where he was. ... Perhaps the odor of incense
and all those folks in saffron robes might have given him a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Senator also derided Gore for defending the 1996
fundraising calls he placed from his office with the repeated
assertion that there was no ``no controlling legal authority'' that
banned the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell the vice president and everyone else, when I am
president, there will be a controlling legal authority,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposed bans on soft money donations, saying that unless
union donations to campaigns are also controlled, GOP candidates
will find themselves at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments, Bradley focused on McCain's lead rival, Texas
Governor George W. Bush, who has raised upwards of $70 million and
shunned federal matching funds in his bid for the Republican
nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think the governor of Texas will demonstrate you
can raise too much money in politics,'' Bradley said. The former
New Jersey senator said he might have to accept soft money if he
winds up running against Bush. But if Bradley and McCain are the
nominees, each said they would foreswear those funds.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money donations to the national political parties were
originally used for party-building activities and get-out-the-vote
efforts. Now, however, the unlimited and unregulated donations from
corporations, unions and individuals to the Republican National
Committee and the Democratic National Committee are frequently used
for issue-advocacy ads to influence congressional and presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley both agree that soft money should be banned.
And they both favor free television time for federal candidates.
But they differ on one crucial aspect of campaign reform. Bradley
has called for public financing of congressional elections. McCain
says he does not want his tax dollars being used to support
candidates with whom he disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is considerable controversy over the need to
overhaul the way campaigns are financed. Legislation has been
stalled repeatedly in the Congress. And many liberal and
conservative advocacy groups, such as National Right to Life and
the ACLU, have vigorously fought the measure sponsored by McCain
and Senator Russell Feingold, the Wisconsin Democrat, contending
that it is an unconstitutional limitation on their free speech
right to broadcast their point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Stenson, executive director of New Hampshire Citizens for
Life, stood before the senators Thursday and told McCain that his
bill would make it illegal for citizens' groups to even mentioning
the name of a member of Congress in the two months prior to any
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you justify, Senator McCain, oppressing the free speech
rights of organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, or even
my own organization, Citizens For Life?'' asked Stenson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very clever misrepresentation of my position,''
replied McCain, who then demanded Stenson pay attention to his
explanation. The Arizona Republican said he is trying to eliminate
undisclosed and unaccounted money from the political process. He
told Stenson that he can personally contribute money to a campaign,
as long as he is identified as a donor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not deprive your ability to exercise free speech,''
said McCain. ``That's a totally false mischaracterization of the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony McConnell, whose father posed the 1995 question that led
to the famous handshake between Clinton and Gingrich, asked McCain
and Bradley if they would use campaign finance reform as a litmus
test to appoint Supreme Court justices. McCain said he does not
believe in litmus tests, and Bradley said he would select judges
based on competence.
</P>
<P>
   While Thursday's media event allowed McCain and Bradley to
portray themselves as outsiders fighting against powerful,
entrenched opponents, the truth is that both have long been
skillful fundraisers operating within the system they now decry.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, to this day, raises money from people and companies with
business before the Senate Commerce Committee, which he chairs. And
Bradley was considered a master fund-raiser in the Senate. This
year, he has defied expectations with his success in presidential
fund-raising, considering that his opponent is the sitting Vice
President who enjoys the support of many party leaders and
traditional interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if either of them had been influenced by the money
that came their way in donations, one said yes, the other, no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there have been times when I believe I have been
influenced because the big donor buys access to my office and we
all know that access buys influence,'' McCain said. ``That taints
all of us. It taints me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, on the other hand, said he had never made a decision
based on a political donation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thursday's event prompted Gore and Bush, the national
frontrunners, to take notice. Gore bought a full-page ad in the
Claremont Eagle Times entitled ``My pledge to you.''
</P>
<P>
   It said campaign finance reform would be at the top of his
agenda, if elected. It also said Gore would not use soft money --
assuming his Republican opponent agrees _ in the general election.
In a minor swipe at Bradley, the ad asked voters to ``look beyond
the rhetoric'' of the candidates to their actual records.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain has shown real courage in taking on his own party
and working for real reform,'' Gore said in the advertisement. His
omission of similar praise for Bradley, left the impression that he
doesn't think his own opponent has been as diligent.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked about McCain's harsh comments about his
fund-raising visit to-raising at the Buddhist temple, Gore said in
Tennessee that he has acknowledged his mistake. ``The fact is, a
lot of candidates have found that the current system creates all
kinds of problems,'' Gore said, calling for enactment of the
McCain-Feingold bill and full public financing of federal
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was also campaigning in Tennessee Thursday, said that
he would ban soft money contributions from corporations and labor
unions, but not individuals. He also complained that McCain's plan
would allow unions to elect liberal Democrats at the expense of
Republicans. McCain, however, supports a ``paycheck protection''
plan to require union members to sign a form before their dues
could be used for political purposes.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leaders of Syria and Israel agreed to begin
intensive and accelerated talks early next month intended to end
the state of war that has existed between them for 50 years,
President Clinton announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned that ``the journey will be tough'' when the talks
start near Washington, and he pointedly did not predict success.
But he emphasized the determination of the Israelis and the Syrians
to negotiate in good faith and promised American aid at every step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past 48 hours,'' Clinton said, ``Israel and Syria
have taken critical steps in the journey toward peace. That journey
will be a difficult one. But with courage and perseverance on both
sides, the result will be deeply rewarding to the people of Israel
and to the people of Syria.''
</P>
<P>
   The president announced the talks in a five-minute statement on
the White House driveway Thursday afternoon. Prime Minister Ehud
Barak of Israel stood tight-lipped and mute to his right; Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria stood in impassive silence to
his left.
</P>
<P>
   The three men returned to the West Wing of the White House after
the president's remarks without answering reporters' shouted
questions. Clinton guided them with a hand on each of their backs,
but the Israeli and the Syrian did not speak or shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the moment was heavy with promise and symbolism, coming
after nearly four years of cold silence between the two nations.
President Hafez Assad of Syria, who is thought to be in ill health,
did not attend the talks, but it is clear that al-Sharaa carries
his proxy.
</P>
<P>
   This week's talks about talks, which began on Wednesday morning
in the Oval Office, had a narrow goal: to set a time and ground
rules for more formal negotiations on the issues that divide Israel
and Syria. Those include borders _particularly the status of the
strategic Golan Heights _ security, terrorism, water rights and
diplomatic and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
   Those substantive matters were not on the table and were dealt
with only obliquely. Thus, all three parties could claim that the
two days of talks were an unqualified success.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations will resume on Jan. 3 at a location that has
not yet been chosen. State Department officials are searching for a
location near Washington that is secure and secluded but also close
enough for Clinton to reach on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   No deadline has been set for securing an agreement and White
House aides said the talks would continue as long as they are
making progress. Barak and al-Sharaa agreed to stay in the United
States for an extended period, or to break off for a time and
return, if the prospect of success remains, a senior White House
official said.
</P>
<P>
   But an Israeli official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said that Barak was not willing to conduct open-ended
negotiations without the promise of a comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton briefed several world leaders by telephone after the
discussions concluded on Thursday, according to a White House
spokesman. He called Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader; Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt,
Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah of Jordan and
King Muhammad VI of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, Syrians and Israelis agreed not to discuss the
substance of the talks conducted over the past two days, and for
the most part kept the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and al-Sharaa decided not to speak on the White House
driveway on Thursday afternoon, in part because al-Sharaa's bitter
harangue on Wednesday morning about Israeli occupation of Syrian
territory morning was poorly received by Israeli and American
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told an Israeli reporter as he was entering his limousine
to leave the White House on Thursday afternoon that the talks were
``hard, but we're on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Gadi Baltiansky, Barak's spokesman, said: ``Overall, the
atmosphere was quite positive. It was the first step in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa made no comments as he left the White House, nor did
any other member of the Syrian delegation.
</P>
<P>
   American officials were more expansive, but offered few details
of the substance or the tenor of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, a sense of relief that the initial round had
borne fruit, and a guarded optimism that next month's more pointed
negotiations could lead to a peace treaty that would forever change
the psychological and physical map of the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is significant is that the two sides at the very highest
level met together for first time in 50 years and decided to launch
serious negotiations to reach a peace agreement,'' Sandy Berger,
the national security adviser, said on Thursday night in an
interview. ``I think that's a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``They opened a gate. They now have to walk down a
very bumpy road and I can't say for sure whether they will succeed.
But I can say they are embarking on this with a serious intent to
reach an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger described the atmosphere of the talks as proper and
cordial, but not warm. He said the Israeli prime minister and the
Syrian foreign minister spoke informally during negotiating
sessions but did not appear to establish anything approaching
camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa, for example, refused to shake Barak's hand in public.
He told American officials that he would reserve that gesture for a
more significant moment.
</P>
<P>
   If a warmer personal relationship is to develop, Berger said, it
will grow from the more intensive discussions.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department official who handles Middle East
matters said Barak and al-Sharaa refuse to follow any script, even
one written by the chief sponsor of the talks, the United States.
And while there will be an element of theatrics to the negotiations
_ the withheld handshake, for instance _ there will also be
substance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meat is that both sides have their own reasons for wanting
to come to a deal and they're not going to let theatrics get in the
way of that,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks on Thursday afternoon, Clinton said Israel has
embarked on serious negotiations with the Palestinians and the
Syrians and talks on Lebanon are expected soon. He said the world
could hope to see a ``new and different'' Middle East in the coming
months and pledged American assistance ``every step of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on the Syrian track, American participation is crucial.
Hostility and distrust are so deep that neither side is yet willing
to speak without an interlocutor present. At no time during the
past two days did al-Sharaa and Barak meet alone.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is thus destined to be mediator, guarantor and
ultimately underwriter of any peace between Israel and Syria. The
costs will be large, but the administration is prepared to ask
Congress for a multi-billion-dollar package to implement an
agreement, should one be reached next year.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that the two days of
discussions had been ``inspiring'' because of the apparent depth of
commitment to peace by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about a sense of great movement forward and a
sense of hope, but also a very realistic view of the fact that
we've got a lot to do,'' Albright said at a briefing after the
leaders left the White House. ``And so these two days were filled
with hope and also frank realism about the amount of work that
needed to be done.''

ISRAEL, SYRIA AGREE TO SECOND ROUND OF TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Signaling their determination to intensify a
historic push for peace, Israeli and Syrian leaders have agreed,
after two days of face-to-face, talks to return to Washington in a
little over two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called the first round of talks and the
leaders' commitment to resume negotiations a ``good start'' toward
a land-for-peace deal _ giving all or most of the Golan Heights
back to Syria in exchange for peaceful relations and security
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   The talks between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa were described by US officials as
professional, businesslike and interspersed with a few informal and
friendly moments of inquiry about each other's family.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the US officials said Thursday, they kept their physical
distance. There was no private handshake.
</P>
<P>
   The two men will meet again on Jan. 3 at an as yet undetermined
location close enough to Washington that will allow President
Clinton to participate as needed.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who spoke of hopes for a wider Mideast peace,
also said negotiations would be difficult. US officials said no
substantive agreements were reached in the two days of talks.
</P>
<P>
   As the State Department hunts for a secluded site, there was no
early word on the little-noticed but critical decision on the
comfort level of the surroundings, whether it should be as spartan
and severe as the Dayton Talks in 1995 that encouraged Balkan
leaders to stay at the table or as pleasing outdoors as the Camp
David presidential retreat nearly two decades ago that encouraged
informal walks.
</P>
<P>
   The only certainty was that neither Camp David, site of the
historic Israel-Egypt talks, nor the Wye Plantation, site of the
difficult Israel-Palestinian negotiations last year, would be
chosen. Syria and Israel have vetoed both places because of the
connotations each site would raise.
</P>
<P>
   The content of the Israeli-Syria talks for the last two days
remained a closely held secret, although Israeli officials said
they discussed their security need for Syria to control Hezbollah
guerrillas in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Sharaa sat across a table from each other at a room at
the Blair House, a presidential guest house across from the White
House, and had a ``very good personal interaction that I think
helped'' the talks, said Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright,
who sat at one end of the table.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that both leaders talked not just about their
issues, but about a wider peace that could result from an
Israeli-Syria deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I found interesting, really, from both sides is the fact
that they see what they're doing as historic and opening up the
possibility for an entirely different relationship, not only
between Israel and Syria, but for the Middle East as a whole,''
Albright told reporters. ``We are talking about something that is a
qualitative difference in the relationship within the region.''
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli-Syria deal is likely to encompass four major
components: withdrawal of Israeli settlements from the Golan
Heights, the timetable for withdrawal, mutual security and the
diplomatic, economic and cultural nature of relations.
</P>
<P>
   But tied into the deal is Lebanon, which Syria essentially
controls. Alongside an Israeli-Syrian deal, US officials expect a
companion Israeli-Lebanese arrangement in which Israel would
withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon and the Lebanese army
would control Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Syrian and Israeli negotiations off to a good start,
Israeli-Lebanese negotiations expected to begin soon and the
Palestinian track well under way, we can truly set our sights on a
new and different Middle East,'' Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But both Clinton and Albright Thursday sounded cautionary notes
about first securing an Israeli-Syrian deal.
</P>
<P>
   Said the president: ``The journey will be tough. Nothing in the
past 48 hours should lead us to believe otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was specifically referring to the talks between
Barak and Sharaa, the past two days also included fresh violence in
southern Lebanon, last active Arab-Israeli warfront.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-supported Southern Lebanese Army fired mortar rounds
at the Arab Selim village in south Lebanon Thursday, hitting near a
school and wounding 20 Lebanese children. The attack was a response
to Hezbollah guerrilla attack on a village inside
Israeli-controlled South Lebanon that wounded a children.
</P>
<P>
   Even as television pictures Thursday showed chairs scattered in
the school, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, at the end of the
Washington talks, told Israel's Channel One television:
</P>
<P>
   ``If there will be a hostile situation there (in southern
Lebanon), everything we are doing will blow up,'' Levy said in
Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the talks, the highest level discussions ever between
Israel and Syria in their 51 years of enmity, the White House had
strategically attempted to lower expectations from the Barak-Sharaa
meeting. The goal was simply to set another round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set our expectations at the bottom of the barrel,'' one US
official said on condition of anonymity. The official called the
talks ``good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication on how long either leader would stay.
There also was little indication about the lasting impact of
Sharaa's strong words Wednesday at the opening of the talks in
which he said that the world has failed to recognize that Syria was
the wronged party in Israel's capture of the Golan Heights in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Said one Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity:
``We know he was talking to a Syria-Arab audience. But it didn't
help us. It just ignited the opposition back home.''

CIVILIANS DODGE GUNFIRE TO FLEE INTENSE RUSSIAN BOMBING OF GROZNY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PERVOMAISKAYA, Russia _ Desperate civilians fleeing the
blistering Russian bombardment of Grozny said Thursday that they
had to run a gantlet of gunfire in the humanitarian corridor set up
by the Russian army.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees interviewed at this checkpoint six miles from the
outskirts of Grozny said a bus full of refugees was riddled with
machine gun fire, leaving four wounded, and at least one car burst
into flames. Mortars exploded as elderly civilians, women and
children huddled in a ditch for hours before making the long,
chilly walk to Russian-controlled Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the refugees said the terrifying Russian bombardment had
persuaded them to take their chances on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to leave today because I could be dead tomorrow if I
stayed,'' said Abdrazak Dovletmirzayev, 64. ``The Russians are
really bombarding us very heavily now. There are artillery strikes
every night. It is really horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   As the battle for Grozny has begun, residents say the city is
being pounded relentlessly. Russian commanders do not plan a
frontal assault on the capital but plan to move cautiously to take
Grozny neighborhood by neighborhood. As they prepare to mount
reconnaissance raids into the city, they are depending heavily on
their advantage in firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters reported from Grozny on Wednesday that more than 100
Russian soldiers were killed and 15 armored vehicles destroyed on a
doomed expedition into the center of the city. The Russian military
reacted angrily to the story, denying that any fighting had taken
place within the city limits. Military spokesmen said that two
soldiers were killed, but they did not say where.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian plan calls for evacuating as many of Grozny's
civilians as possible before the fighting comes to a head. But only
4,500 have used the two humanitarian corridors so far, Sergei
Shoigu, Russia's minister for emergency situations, said at the
Russian military base at Mozdok Thursday. Shoigu said that between
7,000 and 45,000 civilians are still living in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   The question for them is what is safer: to stay and risk dying
from Russian bombs and starvation or to risk being fired at in the
safety corridor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They open a corridor for us and when we try to leave we are
turned into kasha,'' said Lyubov Shakhtemirova, 48, using the
Russian word for porridge.
</P>
<P>
   In the turmoil around the capital, it was difficult to determine
who was doing the shooting. Gen. Ivan I. Babichev, the senior
military commandant of the Russian-controlled zone in Chechnya,
blamed the Islamic militants, saying that they were trying to
discourage the civilians from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shoot at the entrance of the corridor from the city,''
Babichev said. ``They are trying to preserve their human shields.''
</P>
<P>
   Some refugees, however, blamed the Russian forces, though
shell-shocked civilians who passed through the checkpoint here
Thursday said they did not get a good look at their attackers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Grozny was established in the 19th century as a Russian
fortress. The very name of the city means ``menacing.'' And it
certainly lived up to its name Thursday _ for the civilians, for
the Islamic rebels and for the Russians troops.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny has also become a symbol of the West's inability to
influence Russians or the militants they are fighting. Knut
Vollebaek, the chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe and Norway's foreign minister, completed a
three-day trip to the Caucasus Thursday by visiting the
Russian-controlled part of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Vollebaek has talked in very general terms about the need for
negotiations and has repeatedly urged a cease-fire. The Russians
have listened to his proposals but without any apparent interest.
And at Pervomaiskaya Thursday, the European diplomat was little
more than a bystander.
</P>
<P>
   ``The counter-terrorism operation is underway and nobody is
going to stop it,'' Shoigu said. ``We do not need any mediators
involved in this.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, in fact, the fate of Grozny's civilians was not the
main story. Rather, it was the news reports that the Russian
reconnaissance force in Grozny had been wiped out by Islamic
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russian spokesmen disputed the report, Russian
commanders have said in recent days that numerous raids and
reconnaissance probes will be carried out to reclaim the city. The
operations within the city, they said, are to be conducted by
Interior Ministry forces with the support of a small number of
Chechen militia, which is supporting the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Babichev predicted in his interview that the city would be
firmly under Russian control within a month and invited a reporter
to visit him in January in his new office in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   At the checkpoint near Pervomaiskaya, it was clear that the
battle for Grozny was entering a decisive phase. The civilians who
trudged through Checkpoint North, located in the hills overlooking
the city, were passed by a column of Russian armor and trucks
heading toward the capital as artillery and rocket fire rumbled in
the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombing is increasing,'' said Dzhamlat Abuyev, 20, who
staggered through the checkpoint, exhausted by a long and
treacherous hike from Grozny. ``That's why I left. But we were shot
at and had to abandon the car we left in.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shakhtemirova had a particularly harrowing tale of her
flight through the humanitarian corridor. She had taken refuge in a
basement with her child. Last month, she joined a small group of
civilians that tried to escape to the south but turned back after
they were raked by fire, dragging their dead with them. Her knees
are still scrapped from crawling along the ground to avoid the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But as her food _ mostly pickled vegetables _ began to run out,
she decided to make another run for it. There is some food for sale
in Grozny, she said, but noodles, rice and vegetable oil are being
sold for more than twice the amount charged in pricey Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were starving,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And with Russian troops tightening their stranglehold on the
city, it was also clear that the time to try an escape was running
short. Rumors have swept Grozny that the corridor will only be open
until December 28, with stepped-up Russian assaults on the rebel
positions in Grozny to follow.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Shakhtemirova joined a group of 50 civilians packed into
a bus that moved out of Grozny Thursday morning. Suddenly, she
said, the vehicle was riddled with machine gun fire and its tires
were shot out. Mortars exploded around it. Two cars behind the bus
caught on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The civilians _ many elderly, as well as women and children _
climbed out of the bus and took refuge in a roadside ditch for two
hours. Finally, they ventured out of the trench and made the long,
cold trek to Checkpoint North at the end of the corridor. Four
civilians were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got out of the bus with our white flags, but they kept
shooting,'' she said. ``We don't know exactly where the shooting
was coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Dovletmirzayev trudged through Checkpoint North a little while
later. He had tried to ride out the war in Grozny so he could keep
an eye on his small apartment even though that meant surviving
entirely on tea and a ration of bread, which he baked himself. The
intensifying bombardment finally persuaded him to leave, but he
also reported that the safety corridor was anything but safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a shooting on the road,'' he said. ``A car with a
trailer was hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Dovletmirzayev said his trek to the checkpoint had taken six
hours. He moved slowly though the checkpoint, pulling a small wagon
with his belongings: soap, several cans of food, a razor and an
extra pair of trousers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all that I have at 64 years,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just two years ago, when Ravinia Hayes-Cozier walked
into a board meeting of AIDS Action, one of the country's largest
AIDS umbrella organizations, she felt a familiar, sinking feeling.
There was only one other African-American in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' admitted Ms. Hayes-Cozier, the executive
director of the Harlem Directors Group, a coalition of service
organizations for Upper Manhattan. She wondered if the two together
would be able to corral support during policy discussions about the
disease that had ravaged neighborhoods like hers since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since that meeting, much has changed at AIDS Action. Nearly a
quarter of its members represent organizations that cater to
minorities, and its board has several black and Latino members.
</P>
<P>
   That changing composition reflects the broad, fundamental shift
in the role of minorities in policy-making and fund raising in
fighting AIDS across the country. The executive offices and boards
of broad-based AIDS organizations look increasingly like AIDS
Action.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent black organizations like the NAACP and traditionally
black churches have overcome their reticence to take on the issue,
recognizing that the illness in the last decade has claimed more
and more of their own. Latino groups have also become more
involved, although their representation on major boards lags behind
that of blacks. And accompanying their interest has been a greater
influx of dollars, as groups have become better versed in fund
raising and as substantially more federal money has been earmarked
for AIDS programs specifically for minority concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a major shift in players and priorities at the
table on AIDS policy,'' said Daniel Zingale, the director of AIDS
Action, which is based in Washington. ``There is no question that
the changes are in direct response to the realities of today's
epidemic, which is increasingly black, Latino and female.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those who died from AIDS in 1998, 49 percent were
African-American; that figure was 29 percent in 1990, according to
figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   This vastly changed dynamic is also transforming policy, from
the way the federal government administers money for AIDS treatment
to the way that social service organizations have redistributed
their resources.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, while the focus during much of the late 1990s was
on new and powerful drug regimens that have prolonged the lives of
many people with AIDS, many of the African-American and Latino
groups have instead directed their focus back to prevention to try
to arrest the devastation of their communities. And the Medicaid
program, the federal insurance program for the poor, has quietly
eased the rules that people must have full-blown AIDS to get
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, at the behest of the Congressional Black Caucus,
President Clinton signed a $156 million bill for AIDS prevention
programs specifically geared to minorities. Next year, the amount
will be increased to $245.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kweisi Mfume, the president of the NAACP, recently took a seat
on the board of the National Black Leadership Commission on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the oldest and largest AIDS
service organization in the country, the executive director is a
Hispanic woman, and her deputy is an African-American man.
</P>
<P>
   The role of minorities in policy and advocacy has clearly lagged
behind the epidemiological reality of AIDS. In 1999, 54 percent of
new cases of HIV infections occurred among blacks, even though they
make up less than 15 percent of the population, a disparity in
place for five years. Significant advocacy among black religious
leaders, traditional black political organizations and even black
members of government was rare.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, black churches, which tend to be quite
conservative, were not comfortable taking on sexuality and drug use
among their parishioners. Some church leaders were clearly not
paying attention to the numbers of those affected by the disease,
public health experts said. Some still were transfixed on
competing, urgent issues like poverty and infant mortality.
</P>
<P>
   But the ceaselessness of the disease, both in the United States
and in Africa, has caused many leaders to rethink their positions.
And new leadership at organizations like the NAACP and the action
of the Black Caucus ignited the fire. ``I genuinely believe the
staggering number of statistics created a groundswell that forced
immediate action,'' said Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., who was
directly involved in the legislation to increase federal money for
AIDS programs.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption of minorities into leadership spots in
established AIDS organizations is clearly more than a token
gesture: AIDS service organizations are increasingly finding that
their funding depends on it. The CDC now requires states that apply
for AIDS money to create programs geared to populations in which
the disease is most prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 29 percent of CDC money for AIDS counseling and testing
went to programs for African-Americans; in 1997, the number was 23
percent, said Dr. Helene Gayle, the director of the agency's HIV
prevention unit. ``This is a fairly substantial increase,'' Dr.
Gayle said. ``We expect to continue to see those kinds of shifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Many states and cities are also trying to readjust budgets so
that minority programs get bigger slices of the money pie. New
York's AIDS Advisory Council is recommending that its AIDS money be
reshuffled so that more goes to programs for blacks and Latinos. In
Los Angeles, which declared a state of emergency two months ago
regarding the rising cases of AIDS among minorities, the county
earmarked an additional $1.2 million to respond to the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, black and Latino groups argue, education and
prevention programs tend to be more astute when they are run by
members of the same communities as those served. Until recently,
they said, benefactors pressured them to replicate outreach
strategies that had been effective among the well-mobilized gay
groups during earlier stages of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't make sense,'' said Ms. Hayes-Cozier of the
Harlem group. ``You aren't going to find black women in bars or
bath houses. You have to look in laundromats and beauty parlors.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Further, African-Americans who work to fight AIDS believe that
they have learned through their own experiences in the church how
to better recruit religious leaders to get on board with their
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk about AIDS prevention to black churches,'' said
Deborah Levine, the vice president of health and wellness
strategies for Harlem Congregations for Community Improvement, a
religious consortium, ``we have conversations that address their
belief system. If they are comfortable talking about abstinence, we
talk about that. We might not use explicit pictures. You use
language people are comfortable with. ''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And slowly but surely, more and more black religious groups have
brought AIDS to the pulpit. At the Church of Covenant Missionary
Baptist Church in Rochester, there is an AIDS outreach program and
a support group that meets six times a week. ``Five years ago, this
was not something that was supported by local congregations,'' said
the Rev. Willie Davis, the church's pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Church groups, still the slowest to come around, have also been
struck by the math, many experts said. ``You do you have some
members of the clergy who are still troubled by the gay issue,''
said Philip Hilton, a vice president of the Black Leadership
Commission on AIDS. ``But many more are seeing this as
administering to the needs of their people. People dying of AIDS
now are members of their choir.''
</P>
<P>
   Latinos, whose representation has also grown among mainstream
AIDS groups, have been slower to mobilize, many experts said. In
large part, this is because they are less homogenous as a group,
with allegiances to those from the same country rather than to
others who simply share their language.
</P>
<P>
   ``The congressional Hispanic caucus has been slower to
respond,'' said Dennis DeLeon, president of the Latino Commission
on AIDS. ``The disease started with homosexuals and drug users, and
that was difficult for Latinos to deal with,'' he added. ``It was
difficult to find leadership to embrace those two communities.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Political empowerment is almost certain to continue to change
the flow of the dollars, say experts on AIDS policy. Jackson said
that 40 percent of the new federal money is for first-time
recipients of grants. And minority AIDS organizations that once
centered on support groups and condom distribution have now turned
some of their attention to politics and fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten much more involved in issues of service
allocation and money in the last few years,'' said Michael
Saunders, the director of education and support for Gay Men of
African Descent, a New York group. ``It has become more important
to make people aware that we were not getting our fair share.''

LEWINSKY TESTIFIES AGAINST TRIPP IN PHONE TAPING CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLICOTT CITY, Md. _ Alternating between deep concern and
lightheartedness, Monica Lewinsky testified in a Maryland court for
more than an hour Thursday in an effort to help state prosecutors
put Linda Tripp in jail for secretly tape-recording their
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, a poised and practiced witness by now, told the
prosecutors that she had not given Mrs. Tripp permission to record
their telephone conversations when she discussed her relationship
with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not consented,'' she told a deputy state attorney
general, Carmen Shepard, in Howard County Circuit Court near Mrs.
Tripp's home.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky also testified that she did not rely on anything
she learned from the independent counsel's investigation of her
relationship with Clinton when she identified a particular
conversation as having taken place on Dec. 22, 1997. The state
charges filed against Mrs. Tripp last July involve the tape that
she made of that conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Determining the date of the conversation is crucial for
prosecutors, who have charged Mrs. Tripp with two felony counts for
knowingly violating Maryland's wiretap laws, which prohibit taping
a conversation without the consent of the other person. Although
Mrs. Tripp secretly taped more than 20 hours of her conversations
with Ms. Lewinsky, the Dec. 22 conversation is the only one that
took place after prosecutors believe Mrs. Tripp was definitively
informed by her lawyer that it was illegal to do so in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Shepard asked what Ms. Lewinsky felt when she first saw
herself on the cover of Newsweek magazine on Feb. 2, 1998, and
inside the magazine read a transcript of the Dec. 22 conversation
with Mrs. Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky replied, ``It terrified me because I
was concerned about the privacy of my relationship being
revealed.''
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from Ms. Shepard, Ms. Lewinsky said there were
many references in the transcript that made her certain the
conversation had taken place on Dec. 22. ``It was clear to me that
this was from a conversation I had with Linda Tripp on Dec. 22,''
she testified. ``It was etched in my mind because it was a pretty
frightening time for me.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the conversation, both Mrs. Tripp and Ms.
Lewinsky had received subpoenas in the sexual misconduct lawsuit
filed against the president by Paula Corbin Jones. Accusations that
Clinton tried to get Ms. Lewinsky to lie about their relationship
to lawyers for Mrs. Jones led to his impeachment last December.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity for a glare-off between Ms. Lewinsky and the
woman she once told a grand jury she hated did not occur because
Mrs. Tripp chose not to appear in court. There was, however, a
moment of personal drama when Mrs. Tripp's son, Ryan, walked into
the spectator's section and smiled at Ms. Lewinsky, who suddenly
became flustered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky abruptly turned to Judge Diane O. Leasure and asked
if she could have a break. ``You want a recess?'' the judge asked.
``Yeah, please,'' Ms. Lewinsky replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris, said his client was ``not
enthusiastic'' about appearing in court against her former
confidante turned nemesis, Mrs. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did her bit in the impeachment trial and she'll do what
she has to do in this case,'' Cacheris said. `` As far as we're
concerned, that should be the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's appearance was Ms. Lewinsky's first public testimony.
Before then, Ms. Lewinsky had testified only before the closed
grand jury of the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr and in a
videotape presented at Clinton's trial in the Senate, where he was
acquitted on Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Lewinsky's appearance was drained of real suspense
because the issue before the court is a narrow one. Leasure is
deciding whether the state's case against Mrs. Tripp is built on
information gathered independently of Starr's investigation of the
Lewinsky-Clinton relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Under Leasure's ruling, the prosecution must show that none of
its witnesses told the grand jury information they only learned
from their association with the Starr investigation. Federal
prosecutors gave Mrs. Tripp use immunity, which means that nothing
she told them could be used to prosecute her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky was questioned closely by Mrs. Tripp's lawyer,
Joseph Murtha, who tried to show that some of the information she
gave to the state authorities she had received from federal
prosecutors after she began cooperating with them. But Ms. Lewinsky
insisted that her knowledge of the Dec. 22 telephone conversation
did not depend on her many debriefing sessions with the
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   During her cross-examination by Murtha, Ms. Lewinsky displayed a
sophistication about grand jury and law-enforcement matters. At one
point, when Murtha handed her a document, she looked at it and
asked, ``Is this a 302?'' A 302 is law-enforcement jargon for the
written forms used by agents of the FBI to record witness
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's a 302,'' replied a somewhat surprised Murtha.
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony Thursday, Ms. Lewinsky first referred to Mrs.
Tripp by her surname. But later she talked about ``Linda.''
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony, Ms. Lewinsky cited several factors that made
her certain of the date of the conversation with Mrs. Tripp that
was published in Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the fact that she and Mrs. Tripp had just been
subpoenaed in the Jones case, Ms. Lewinsky said she had also talked
to Mrs. Tripp about her appointment that day with Vernon C. Jordan,
a Washington lawyer and Clinton confidant.
</P>
<P>
   After she was excused from the witness stand, Ms. Lewinsky
hoisted one of her signature tote bags onto the shoulder of a long
black coat dress she wore over black pants.
</P>
<P>
   Leasure is expected to rule next week on whether the state's
case is untainted by the federal investigation. If she rules
against the state, Mrs. Tripp will probably go free; if the judge
rules otherwise, the trial is scheduled to begin on Jan. 18. Ms.
Lewinsky could then be called again to testify.

MCCAIN, BRADLEY TEAM UP ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, N.H. _ Sen. John McCain and former Sen. Bill Bradley
joined forces across a partisan and ideological divide Thursday to
pledge support for revamping the nation's campaign finance system
and to take some sharp shots at each other's front-running
opponents for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to underscore Washington's inability to change itself,
McCain, a Republican, and Bradley, a Democrat, re-created on
national television the bipartisan handshake between President
Clinton and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich at the same location
in 1995. At the time, the president and speaker called for a
commission to study changing campaign finance laws. But nothing
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I most of all want to give the government back to the people
of this country,'' McCain said, agreeing with Bradley that
big-money interests have caused gridlock on Capitol Hill. ``I don't
believe we can do that unless we reform the finance system.''
</P>
<P>
   During their event, Bradley and McCain signed a pledge stating
that if both won their parties' nominations, they would not allow
their parties to spend soft money on their general election
campaigns. Both also support legislation to ban soft money
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money is used by the parties for activities like voter
registration and printing signs. Soft money cannot be used to help
specific candidates. But in 1996, soft money was used by both major
parties to finance so-called issue advertising that essentially
promoted the presidential candidates, violating the spirit, if not
the letter of the law.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing to ban soft money, McCain and Bradley would try to
close that loophole. But only McCain has pledged to give up soft
money unilaterally. Bradley says he'll forgo soft money as long as
the Republican nominee does, too. Neither McCain nor Bradley could
stop state parties from spending soft money, expenditures that can
also benefit presidential candidates. So they would leave a
loophole even as they attempted to close one.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's event was unusual not only because the two men are
from different parties and hold conflicting positions on issues
ranging from taxes to gun control to abortion, but also because
their personalities and campaign styles are so different.
</P>
<P>
   Those disparate styles were on view from the moment they
appeared in a tent outside the Earl Bourden Senior Center here. In
his opening statement, McCain, the more combative of the two,
launched a caustic attack on Clinton and Vice President Gore,
Bradley's lone rival for the Democratic nomination, asserting that
they had debased ``every institution of government'' with their
aggressive fund raising in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scandal of the last two years was not Monica Lewinsky,''
McCain said. ``The president took the Lincoln bedroom and treated
it like a Motel 6 and he was the bell hop. And the vice president
of the United States asked monks and nuns to violate their vow of
poverty in order to pay thousands of dollars so that they could
spiritually commune with him.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to a 1996 campaign event that Gore attended at
a Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles. Gore later said he did not know
the event was a fund-raiser, a statement McCain ridiculed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the more cerebral and cautious of the two, opened with
a call for ``a bipartisanship that puts nation above party'' and
described the influence of money on politics as ``a plague'' on
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Republican and Democrat who differ on any number of
other issues, have come together because we believe that money is
eating away at the core of our government the way acid eats away at
cloth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, McCain and Bradley differ in their approach to
campaign finance reform legislation. Bradley supports public
financing of congressional elections while McCain opposes full
taxpayer financing of congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, who barely mentioned Gore during the two-hour
event, later criticized the leading Republican contender, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, who has far outpaced the other candidates
in fund raising. Bush is not participating in the federal campaign
finance system which provides matching funds to presidential
candidates who limit their spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think that the governor of Texas will demonstrate
that you can raise too much money in politics,'' Bradley said. ``I
see that he has essentially thumbed his nose at the public
financing of presidential campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men said they had not consulted each other about their
remarks beforehand, and their aides denied coordinating their
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have built their surprisingly strong outsider campaigns
around courting independent voters, a growing segment of the
electorate, particularly in New Hampshire and Iowa, the first
states to vote in next year's primary season. Aides to both men
assert that independents care more about campaign finance than the
general electorate.
</P>
<P>
   In Nashville Thursday, Gore told reporters that he would also
eschew soft money in the general election if the Republican nominee
did the same. And he said that he would make campaign finance
reform a priority as president, asserting that Bradley was a
Johnny-come-lately to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that I have supported and introduced and sponsored
and co-sponsored more than a dozen measures for more than 20 years
I think does serve as evidence that this is not just a new
political issue, this is a commitment for me of long standing,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He also took a swipe at McCain, noting that he had been one of
five senators who took large campaign contributions from Charles
Keating, a savings and loan operator who was later convicted of
fraud. The Senate Ethics Committee found that McCain had done
nothing improper.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush asserts that banning soft money would hurt
the Republican Party by strengthening the hand of labor unions,
which typically support Democrats. Though unions would be
prohibited from giving soft money under the McCain-Bradley
proposal, they could continue to support candidates with their well
financed get-out-the-vote operations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Thursday that he would support a ban on soft money
only if labor unions were also prohibited from using union dues to
support a candidate, unless each individual worker agrees to it.
``I'm for taking away corporate soft money, money where
shareholders have no say in how the money is spent,'' he said at a
news conference in Nashville. ``I'm also for taking away labor
union soft money so long as the working people have a right to
decide how their money is spent.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 election, the two political parties raised more than
$250 million in soft money, and various campaign finance experts
predict that the figure could more than double by election day
2000. Most of the soft money raised by the political parties has
been spent in recent elections to help elect presidential
candidates, although millions have also been spent by the national
parties to aid state and local candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While pledging to curb soft money spent on the top of the
ticket, it would be nearly impossible, even if Bradley and McCain
are nominated by their respective parties, to eliminate so-called
coordinated soft money spending, which helps elect an entire ticket
of candidates, from local office-holders to president.
</P>
<P>
   During a question-and-answer session moderated by Ted Koppel for
ABC's Nightline, McCain showed off his feistiness in a tart retort
to a man who claimed that his soft-money ban would abridge free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you sir, that's a very clever misrepresentation of my
position,'' McCain said. By comparison, Bradley handled his first
critical question by agreeing with his interlocutor's premise.
</P>
<P>
   The two men also had very different answers to a question about
whether they had ever been influenced by campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that there have been times when I have probably been
influenced because the big donor had access to my office and we
know that access is influence,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley asserted he had never been influenced by donations.
``But it's impossible in the current system to prove that because
there is always suspicion,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In several ways, Thursday's event was symbiotically useful to
each candidate. In Bradley's case, McCain was willing to blast Gore
in ways the more courtly Bradley would not. And McCain may have
benefited from Bradley's larger campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   When, for instance, Bradley pulled up outside the senior center,
a group of his supporters stood by with blue-and-white ``Bill
Bradley for President'' signs. But when McCain rolled up in his
bus, there were no supporters with banners. So Bradley's volunteers
simply turned their cardboard posters around to show another slogan
that served McCain's purposes just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Soft Money,'' they read.

MCCAIN WOWS TOWN HALL MEETING CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, N.H. _ It may have been his 69th town hall meeting
in the first primary state, but Senator John McCain's well-worn
comedic turns still found plenty of laughs at Colby-Sawyer College
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only presidential candidate you will see who attended
the MTV awards,'' he said by way of introduction. ``And I can tell
you, it was the greatest assault on my senses since I was in
prison.''
</P>
<P>
   The other staples of McCain the campaigner were on display, too:
his jocular claim to covet the eccentric look of rapper Busta
Rhymes, with whom he shared the stage at the MTV awards; his
mock-vanity at having his square jaw and bone-white hair grace the
cover of Time magazine; his wife's belief that he decided to run
for President because he ``received several sharp blows to the head
in prison'' during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   His audience of several hundred, composed mostly of elderly
supporters, ate it up, though some also from time to time, shot
each other delighted, `Can you believe he said that?' looks.
</P>
<P>
   This disarming, devil-may-care routine has helped make McCain an
increasingly potent threat to Texas Governor George W. Bush, his
rival for the Republican presidential nomination. McCain's campaign
aides talk about it all the time: they can barely believe their
luck, working for a candidate who says what is on his mind with
little apparent regard for the consequences. It is a trait that has
also proved so far to be a good campaign strategy _ capturing the
imagination of many voters, and endearing McCain to many reporters,
who have rewarded him with copious news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Showtime!'' said strategist Mike Murphy early Thursday
morning, playing Ed McMahon to his candidate's Johnny Carson, as he
warmed up the audience of reporters in the back of McCain's bus,
dubbed The Straight Talk Express. ``Let's send you back a newsmaker
here.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, McCain appeared. He parked himself in a red
leather swivel chair, grabbed a Christmas sprinkle-topped donut and
dispatched it in a couple of lusty mouthfuls.
</P>
<P>
   En route to Claremont, and with a video camera inches from his
face, McCain rambled over a range of subjects -- the weather, the
venison dinner (``A slice of Bambi's mother,'' he quipped) _ until
he came to the one he wanted to pause over.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the day was campaign finance, the remarkable
handshake with Democratic counterpart Bill Bradley, and the pledge
to keep soft money out of the general election if they are both
nominated.
</P>
<P>
   McCain got serious. He vehemently rejected the suggestion that
big donors like AT&AMP;T had had any direct influence on his votes as a
Senator: ``Ask any watchdog organization, and they'll tell you it's
not the case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the bus after the handshake, McCain seemed to be
processing the event as he went along, uncertain of its success. He
worried that he hadn't stated clearly enough that campaign finance
reform should be a conservative priority. He said he wouldn't know
for a few days whether the issue would take on a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a one-day story, or it may have some resonance,'' he
said. Though he said he believed voters are far more concerned
about it than polls suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm wrong,'' he said. ``If so, I'll fail. I've failed at
other things in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Claremont handshake event, Bradley's relaxed, low-key
persona threw McCain's free-wheeling, combative ways into sharp
relief. Bradley was polite and restrained throughout, playing it
mostly straight. McCain wisecracked often, and snapped at one
questioner, accusing him of ``a very clever misrepresentation'' of
his position on campaign finance. While Bradley said he believed
Clinton and then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich had been
well-intentioned when they pledged campaign finance reform in
Claremont in 1995, McCain said he didn't believe the president
``was ever serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The New London Town Hall meeting was McCain's show alone, and
his questioners gave him a chance to hold forth on many subjects,
seldom challenging him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain reiterated his belief that Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old
Cuban boy at the center of an impasse between Cuba and the United
States, should not be returned to Cuba; and he lamented the
turnover of the Panama Canal. When asked if he would try to limit
immigration, he answered with a firm no.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to fully fund special education, while maintaining
strict standards for entry into programs. He called for higher pay
for teachers, teacher-testing, and more support for charter
schools.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to ``do everything in (his) power to prevent partial
birth abortions,'' if elected.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the meeting, McCain went for the laughs again.
Arizona had bred some good presidential candidates, he said _ Mo
Udall, Barry Goldwater, Bruce Babbitt _ all of them also-rans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona might be the only state in America,'' he said, ``where
mothers don't tell their children they can be president when they
grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   It brought the house down.

NEW ENGLAND LAWMAKERS BRAINSTORM ON BEST WAYS TO LOWER PRICES
</HEADLINE>
 ENGLAND-DRUGS-500&AMP;ADD-NYT   (rk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. _ Legislative leaders from the four northern New
England states gathered here Thursday to plot joint strategies for
lowering the price of prescription drugs, from imposing local price
controls to pooling their residents to demand a regional mass
discount.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, the first of its kind, was largely a brainstorming
session, but participants said it could grow into a movement among
states to forge ahead where Congress had balked, and pass laws
forcing the pharmaceutical industry to cut prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress could solve this problem in four hours,'' said Peter
Shumlin, president pro tem of the Vermont Senate, ``but they're
choosing not to because pharmaceutical companies give them gobs of
money for their election campaigns. So we have a responsibility as
states to see what we can do while Congress is sitting on its
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The envoys from Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont
agreed to explore several avenues. They included price controls on
drugs at the state level _ bills to impose such controls are in the
works in Maine and Vermont _ and pooling residents into a sort of
big buying club to negotiate the kind of discount that, say, Canada
has. They also said they planned to invite Connecticut, New York,
Rhode Island and Quebec into the process.
</P>
<P>
   Many details _ in fact, virtually all the details _ remain to be
worked out about how the states can collaborate in challenging the
drug industry. But New England legislatures are known for
undertaking bold social experiments, and by meeting's end, there
was a consensus that the initiative was worth pursuing. The
attendees agreed to an interstate conference call next week and a
second, larger meeting soon after.
</P>
<P>
   Drug company representatives were not invited to the conference.
But the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the
industry's trade association, issued a statement saying that the
solution to the financial crunch that many Americans, especially
the elderly, face in paying for their medications lies not with
government controls but with Medicare reform and broadened
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Price controls ``tell private investors all around the world
that they can earn a higher return on their money if it's invested
in other industries,'' Judith H. Bello, the trade association's
executive vice president, said in a phone interview. Such controls
are bad for the momentum of pharmaceutical research, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for bulk-buying or pooling arrangements, Ms. Bello said, a
Maine commission had recently decided against bulk buying as too
cumbersome and costly, and a bulk-buying plan in the works in
Massachusetts is raising heated debate.
</P>
<P>
   The association also expressed skepticism about the possibility
that the New England states could create a ``pharmaceutical
compact'' much like the regional dairy compact that sets milk
prices. Such a compact, its statement said, ``could take years to
design and implement.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, though speakers at the meeting raised the idea of a
compact, no one appeared to have the patience at this point to
focus on such a politically complex solution: A compact would
require agreement among the states and congressional approval as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they shared some of the shorter-term measures that they
have been trying in their individual states. They heard about the
Massachusetts effort to create one big buyer pool out of 1.6
million residents, among them the uninsured and the poor, and
negotiate a mass discount. And about Maine's expansion of its
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   From New Hampshire came descriptions of a new discount drug
program for senior citizens. And from Vermont, members of a special
legislative committee on drug prices described how they were
pinning many of their hopes on their proximity to Canada, even
considering state-run, medication-buying bus trips across the
border.
</P>
<P>
   It was largely out of that committee's frustration that
Thursday's effort at forging a regional bloc to circumvent Congress
grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to be as creative as we could,'' said Jan Backus, the
state senator who headed the panel, ``but everything we came up
with, there was a block put in place by the drug industry lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   They found they were not allowed by law to re-import drugs from
Canada, where they are much cheaper, Ms. Backus said; they were
also barred from joining the steep group discount the federal
government gets, and could not buy through Indian tribes who share
that discount. They also could not, under the Constitution, impose
price controls on out-of-state manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere we looked, we found a dead end,'' she said. ``It was
very frustrating and very clear we had to come together to make a
political case to get change in Washington, as well as coming
together to bulk buy.''
</P>
<P>
   To these state lawmakers, Congress has succumbed to
pharmaceutical companies and left the state legislatures to find
ways to help citizens pay for drugs. Several bills meant to ease
the pain of high drug prices are in the works in Congress, but the
New England envoys appeared to hold out little hope of a federal
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Obuchowski, the speaker of the Vermont House of
Representatives, said baldly that ``Congress has been bought off by
the pharmaceutical industry.'' In contrast, he said, Thursday's
meeting, in a purple-curtained chamber of the venerable State
House, was ``almost like a clean room environment,'' like those
used in chip manufacturing or space science.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers also emphasized that they did not equate drug
companies with tobacco makers, whose products harm people. They
simply did not think Americans should pay significantly more than
people in other countries, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending the meeting took home a draft resolution
proclaiming that they would work together as a coalition to
coordinate the passage of model laws to cut drug prices, to enter
joint purchasing agreements and more.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting pleased Anthony Pollina, a senior policy adviser for
the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, which has been pushing
for price-control laws for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that this has happened, that leaders of
any group of states have come together to talk about prescription
drugs,'' Pollina said, ``and I think it shows how serious the
problem is, and how serious state policy leaders are about
providing the leadership Congress won't and taking on the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others predicted that other states would begin to band
together to lower drug prices. First, however, the New Englanders
must show that such a group approach is effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a long battle,'' Obuchowski of Vermont
said. ``It's going to be a hard battle, depending on what approach
is taken, and I hope we bring to that battle the resolve to see it
through to the end.''

REPORT CRITICIZES U.N. AND U.S. FOR FAILING TO PREVENT GENOCIDE IN
RWANDA
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: 2nd Take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET) 
(sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A strongly worded report issued on Thursday by
an international panel of experts holds both the United Nations and
leading member countries, primarily the United States, responsible
for failing to prevent or stop the genocide in Rwanda in 1994,
which cost hundreds of thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   The report, commissioned by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who
was then head of the peacekeeping department, spares no one, naming
those in the highest reaches of the United Nations who were running
the operation in Rwanda, including Annan and his predecessor,
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
   Annan and others in his department made weak and equivocal
decisions in the face of mounting disaster, the panel found. At the
same time the Clinton administration _ represented at the United
Nations by Madeleine Albright _ persistently played down the
problem, setting the tone for a Security Council generally lacking
the political will for a tougher response.
</P>
<P>
   Both the United Nations and the United States sent the wrong
message to militias bent on genocide, the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Annan called the report ``thorough and objective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On behalf of the United Nations, I acknowledge this failure
and express my deep remorse,'' he said, calling the events in
Rwanda ``genocide in its purest and most evil form.'' In Rwanda,
government officials said the secretary general should visit and
apologize in person.
</P>
<P>
   But the leader of the investigation, Ingvar Carlsson, a former
Swedish prime minister, did not place all the blame on the United
Nations. At a news conference on Thursday, he said it would
``always be difficult to explain'' why the Security Council _
managed by the world's major powers and not the U.N. bureaucracy _
decimated the peacekeeping force in Rwanda, reducing it to a few
hundred from 2,500 troops when the genocide began, and then
increasing the force to 5,500 when the weeks of massacres were
over.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which provided Carlsson's investigators with
minimal help and no documents during their six-month study,
effectively blocked the Security Council in 1993 and 1994 from
authorizing any significant action in Rwanda. No high-ranking
American officials involved in policy making at the time agreed to
meet the panel.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department said on Thursday that it had cooperated
fully with the investigation, adding that the United States has a
policy of not releasing classified documents to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We disagree with their assessment,'' said James B. Foley, a
State Department spokesman. ``We provided senior officials who
extensively briefed the panel and answered all their questions
satisfactorily.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley said those officials included William Woods, deputy
assistant secretary of state for international organizations, and
Richard Bogosian, one of the department's top Africa specialists.
Both men had studied all the records of the period and discussed
them with the panel, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Carlsson repeated the Clinton administration's
explanation that the loss of 18 American Rangers in Somalia in
October 1993 had scared the United States off peacekeeping for
domestic political reasons, particularly peacekeeping in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Carlsson said blame rested with ``those who didn't care at all,
who said Rwanda is a distant African country.'' On a trip to Rwanda
last year, President Clinton apologized for Washington's inaction.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations opened its archives and made all its former
officials available to the panel on Annan's orders. A U.N. official
said this led to an ``asymmetry'' in the damning details by which
U.N. actions could be judged compared with those of pivotal
governments. Belgium and France, whose peacekeepers were in the
field in Rwanda before and after the genocide, have conducted their
own investigations. The United States has not.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that about 800,000 people were killed in 100
days from April to July 1994, in a Hutu-led campaign of genocide
against Tutsi and moderate Hutu who often defended their neighbors
with their own lives. The killings in Rwanda set off a chain
reaction that led to the current war in Congo, the former Zaire,
involving more than half a dozen African nations.
</P>
<P>
   Annan appointed the three-member panel in May to conduct an
independent investigation into the U.N. role in the critical months
in Rwanda. Besides Carlsson, the members were Han Sung-joo of South
Korea, a former foreign minister and leading international affairs
scholar, and Rufus M. Kupolati of Nigeria, a retired lieutenant
general familiar with U.N. peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwanda report follows by several weeks the release of an
internal U.N. inquiry into problems in the Bosnia peacekeeping
operation that led to thousands of deaths in Serbian attacks on
Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica and other towns. That report also
found fault with both the organization and Security Council
members.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ An appellate court ordered the trial of the four
officers accused of killing Amadou Diallo to be moved to Albany
County, ruling on Thursday that a fair trial would be impossible in
the Bronx because of ``the public clamor'' about the case.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member panel of the Supreme Court Appellate Division
ruled that ``this case cannot be tried in Bronx County, or anywhere
else in the City of New York, without an atmosphere in which jurors
would be under enormous pressure to reach the verdict demanded by
public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 4 shooting of Diallo outside his apartment in the Bronx
sparked large demonstrations against the police, including rallies
outside One Police Plaza that resulted in arrests of celebrities
and high-profile New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, in which 41 shots were fired, was held up as proof
by many people that police frequently react harshly in dealing with
minorities, and it has been the subject of intense news coverage.
Diallo, who was unarmed, was black and the officers who shot him
are white.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, the appellate court wrote: ``We conclude that
this case has been deluged by a tidal wave of prejudicial publicity
to such an extent that even an attempt to select an unbiased jury
would be fruitless.''
</P>
<P>
   The court cited several depictions of the case from media
sources, including a controversial cover on The New Yorker magazine
that showed a smiling police officer shooting at a human cut-out
bearing the words: ``41 shots, 10 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   The court noted that moving a trial in a high-profile case is
``an extraordinary remedy reserved for the rarest of cases,'' but
added that the shooting of Diallo ``is that rare case.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling was immediately denounced by prosecutors and
by Diallo's family. ``I could not disagree more strongly with the
court's decision, which cannot be appealed, to change the place of
trial of the four police officers,'' Robert T. Johnson, the Bronx
district attorney, said in a statement. ``What makes this decision
particularly disturbing is that absolutely no effort was invested
to even attempt to empanel a fair and impartial Bronx jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision, the statement concluded, ``reflects a lack
of trust of the jury selection process in general and of Bronx
jurors in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's parents also expressed dismay over the decision. ``We
waited all this time for justice,'' Saiku Diallo, the victim's
father, said at a press conference at the Harlem headquarters of
the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been acting as an adviser to the
family. ``It will be harmful to me and my family to travel to this
place where we've never been.''
</P>
<P>
   But Patrick Lynch, the president of Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, hailed the decision, calling it ``an opportunity for
these four officers to have a trial that is judged on the facts,
not the politics or other folks' political agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said, ``The court decision
speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The four officers _ Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss, Richard Murphy
and Edward McMellon _ are each facing two counts of second-degree
murder and one count of reckless endangerment. In a motion filed
last month, lawyers for the four men argued that the amount of
publicity the shooting has received, as well as the demonstrations
organized by Sharpton and others, had irrevocably tainted the jury
pool in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also cited the ``conventional wisdom'' that police
officers cannot get a fair trial in Bronx County, which is
populated largely by blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitutional guarantee of the option of a jury trial is
effectively precluded to these defendants,'' said the motion, which
was written by Bennett M. Epstein, a lawyer for Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution had contended that the defense had taken media
coverage out of context and omitted accounts that were favorable to
the officers. The notion that police officers could not get a fair
trial in the Bronx was ``unfounded and unsupported,'' the
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   But the court agreed that some of the publicity was likely to
influence jurors. It cited three examples: The New Yorker cover, a
New York Post column that repeated the word ``bang'' 41 times and
an advertisement by the American Civil Liberties Union that
displayed 41 bullet holes along with the Miranda warning that
begins, ``You have the right to remain silent.'' The ad goes on to
say, ``On February 4th, 1999, the NYPD gave Amadou Diallo the right
to remain silent.''
</P>
<P>
   The five judges, all of whom were appointed by Gov. George
Pataki, said they had decided to move the trial to Albany County
because it is an urban county and is not home to large numbers of
New York City law enforcement officials. After surveying census
data on a number of counties with ``a reasonable degree of ethnic
diversity,'' the court selected Albany County.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. Census data from 1998, Albany's nearly 300,000
residents are 85.8 percent white, 9.2 percent black, 2.7 percent
Asian and 2.3 percent Hispanic. The Bronx's 1.19 million people are
48.3 Hispanic, 29.4 black, 18.6 white, and 3.7 Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers were ``dumbstruck,'' in one attorney's word, by
Thursday's decision to move the trial. ``It is a big victory, a big
victory,'' said Steven Brounstein, the lawyer for Boss. ``Now
hopefully we'll get a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers were uniformly described as pleased by the news
that the trial would go to Albany County. Stephen Worth, the lawyer
for McMellon, said that his client ``was as surprised and pleased
as we were that the Appellate Division had responded to our
argument.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Culleton, the lawyer for Murphy, said the officers
have already been so damaged by negative publicity that moving the
trial would not be much help. ``The severity of this indictment
stemmed directly from the pretrial publicity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, who led demonstrations in which former Mayor David
Dinkins, actress Susan Sarandon and more than 1,000 other people
were arrested, called the decision ``outrageous'' and
``unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a police officer in the Bronx, how come you can't be
tried in the Bronx where you have arrested people and had them
tried,'' Sharpton said, adding later, ``They cannot disenfranchise
a whole county.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``If this trial is in Alaska we'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadiadou Diallo, Diallo's mother, who said she was weak from
observing the Muslim holiday of Ramadan, was also upset by the
decision. ``We don't want our agony to be prolonged, we want
justice. This is not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial was set to begin Jan. 3, but David Bookstaver, a
spokesman for the Office of Court Administration, said it was
unclear when the trial would start. The state must pick a judge in
Albany County to hear the case, and the lawyers may request time to
find a place to live and work.

DISNEY OFFICIAL GUILTY IN PORNOGRAPHY CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
(eds.: no byline) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A prominent Internet executive for the Walt Disney
Co. was convicted Thursday of possessing child pornography on his
computer, but a federal jury deadlocked on the most serious charges
against him: that he enticed a minor to have sex and traveled
across state lines to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The executive, Patrick J. Naughton, 34, oversaw Internet content
for Disney and was earlier a creator of the Java computer language.
</P>
<P>
   Naughton faces up to 10 years in prison on the pornography
charge and 15 years each on the two other counts if he is retried
and convicted. The government has until Jan. 5 to decide whether to
refile the charges: sentencing was scheduled for March 6.
</P>
<P>
   Naughton was arrested in September after he flew from Seattle to
Southern California for what the authorities said he believed was a
rendezvous with a 13-year-old Los Angeles girl he had met online.
His arrest became a tremendous embarrassment to Disney, which
announced simply that he no longer worked there. At one point his
name was expunged from several past announcements on a corporate
Web site, Wired magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Naughton's lawyer, Donald Marks, said Thursday that the
jury's inability to agree on the more serious counts represented a
victory for a defense that portrayed the Internet as a fantasy land
where others are not what they claim to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very gratified,'' Marks said. ``The problem with the
case is that a lot of people do not believe that being involved in
chat rooms, and being involved in the fantasy of having sexual talk
with unknown persons of unknown genders and ages on the Internet,
represents anything but role playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the stand in his own defense, Naughton testified that he
did not really believe the girl from Los Angeles whom he met in the
``dad&AMP;daughtersex'' chat room, with the online identity of
``KrisLA,'' was who she said she was.
</P>
<P>
   She was not. ``KrisLA'' was in reality a male agent of the FBI
named Bruce Applin. In an affidavit, Applin wrote that he
repeatedly told Naughton, who was using the name ``hotseattle,''
that he was 13.
</P>
<P>
   Naughton responded by saying he wanted to come to Los Angeles to
``kiss, make out and play and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Naughton was arrested on Sept. 16 at the Santa Monica pier after
approaching a woman who was an undercover Los Angeles County
sheriff's deputy carrying a green backpack, as Applin said had been
agreed to in one of the chat sessions. Patricia Donahue, the
federal prosecutor who handled the case, derided Naughton's defense
in her closing argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't interested in playing any type of role,'' Ms.
Donahue said. ``He was his real self.''

CAJUN HOSTS SURPRISED BY CLOSE PRESENCE OF CUBAN PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. MARTINVILLE, La. _ The angry Cubans holding hostages in the
local jail could not be further from home than they are in this
revered heart of French Acadiana, where countless Cajun surnames
end in ``x'' and Spanish is a distant third language.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in this town of 8,000, about 110 miles west of New
Orleans, had no idea that the federal government was holding Cuban
prisoners in their midst, just a few hundred yards from the famous
Evangeline oak tree symbolizing the story immortalized by
Longfellow. As the standoff entered its fourth day, with no sign
that the prisoners were willing to put down their handmade weapons
and release the warden and two deputies, some questioned why the
local parish had admitted the Cubans in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know all these Cubans were in there,'' said Bill
Broussard, who works at a heavy-equipment dealership a few miles
away and was part of the daily crowd gaping at the St. Martin
Parish jail on Thursday in hopes of seeing some action. ``I hope
our town isn't paying good money to keep rioters in there.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, it is St. Martin Parish, like more than 200 other
counties around Louisiana and the South, that benefits from housing
detainees of the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service,
which is one of the main reasons they are here.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency began dispersing Cuban detainees to local
jails after the calamitous 1987 riots in Oakdale, La., and Atlanta,
deciding it was dangerous to imprison them in large concentrations.
It cannot deport the prisoners, who have been convicted of crimes
and served their sentences, because the Castro government will not
accept them. So it is forced to pay high rates to counties to house
them. Here in St. Martinville, the county gets $45 a day for each
of its 72 Cuban detainees, compared with $22 for state prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials admit that they need the money, but the parish
sheriff, Charles Fuselier, said he was also sympathetic to the
federal government's needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be more of a problem than normal prisoners, but the
INS has to have a place to put them,'' Fuselier said. ``We do
charge for it. I'm certainly not going to hold prisoners for
nothing. But if we don't hold them here, where are you going to
hold them?''
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, 60 percent of the immigration agency's
17,000 prisoners are in local jails, said Russ Bergeron, chief
spokesman for the INS. Of the 2,400 prisoners who are Cuban and
cannot be deported, about 1,400 are in local jails, he said, with
the more violent detainees in federal prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The agency could not hold all 17,000 prisoners if it wanted to,
Bergeron said, but scattering them around the country _
particularly frustrated ones like the Cubans _ also has a tactical
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we have not had any large-scale disturbance
similar to those in 1987 would indicate this concept does provide
greater security for all the parties involved,'' he said. There
have been repeated small disturbances and uprisings like this one
in local jails, but because the numbers of detainees are kept to a
few dozen at each site, the chance of widespread damage is remote.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the hostage-takers are armed with weapons of
sharpened metal. Though they pose an obvious danger to their three
hostages and to other prisoners, their potential damage seems
limited. Negotiations continued throughout the day and night, but
FBI officials would not say if any progress had been made.
</P>
<P>
   The four ringleaders of the uprising do have extensive criminal
backgrounds, however, which include assault on a police officer,
rape, robbery and drug possession, according to records released by
the immigration service.
</P>
<P>
   Though each has finished his state sentence for his crimes, none
of the four _ like the other 2,400 Cubans still in custody _ is
allowed to be released because the agency considers all four to be
threats to society. Normally, they would be deported after
finishing their sentences, like the 1,000 other prisoners the
government deports each week. But convicts from Cuba, as well as
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, cannot be returned to their home
countries, where the United States has no repatriation agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the Cuban prisoners say it is ridiculous that
American prisoners are released from prison after they complete
their sentences, whether or not they still pose a threat to
society, while noncitizens are forced to stay in custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not an immigrant, you can walk the streets no matter
what your record is,'' said Ruby Feria, a spokeswoman for a Miami
prisoners' rights group, Mothers for Freedom. ``How long should
they have put up with this kind of treatment? How long can you tell
them to be calm and collected? Everyone has a limit, and they were
tested to the max and were pushed over their limit.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the inmates participating in the incident, Gonzalo
Davila, came from Cuba in 1981 and was convicted of theft in 1993,
according to his sister, Luz Maria Davila of Miami. He served his
five-year sentence, but because the INS still considered him a
threat, he has been in detention for the last year, including five
months in St. Martinville.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his letters, he tells me he would rather be in Cuba, dead
even,'' Ms. Davila said. ``He says being there is worse than being
in Cuba. I just feel like he shouldn't be there any longer. He
served what he had to serve, and now he should be set free. He
hasn't killed anyone for them to have him stuck there with all
kinds of criminals.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The American Bar Association has also criticized the practice of
holding prisoners after they have served their sentences, but the
immigration agency says it has no choice _ it cannot take the
responsibility of releasing a non-citizen to the streets who might
commit a serious crime.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the prisoners are often turned over to local
sheriffs, who are required to meet certain conditions to house
them: They must provide a translator, a physician, a law library
and modern buildings. Many counties and parishes have decided they
do not want the hassle, and refuse to house federal detainees. And
international visitors are not always welcome in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're usually at capacity on our own,'' said Laura Balthazar,
chief deputy sheriff in neighboring St. Landry Parish. ``And
besides, when you get an INS prisoner, you don't even know what
they're charged with. It's not worth it. One time, we took in 13
females overnight that the INS was transferring, and I'm still
looking for my money.''
</P>
<P>
   Those counties that do accept federal detainees usually have
excess jail space and a need for cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 400 beds here, and those extra inmates fill the
beds,'' said Michael Blumberg, warden of the Citrus County
Detention Facility in Lecanto, Fla., a jail operated by a private
firm that has 29 federal detainees, mostly Cuban. ``However many
people are in your pod, you're still burning electricity, that kind
of stuff, so it is helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   The county's agreement with the INS requires the detainees to be
moved out if county prisoners fill the jail, he said.

AIRLINE PLEADS GUILTY OF ILLEGAL STORAGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (rk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American Airlines on Thursday pleaded guilty to
illegal storage of hazardous waste, a felony, and admitted that it
had transported hazardous and poisonous materials improperly on its
passenger jets for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The company will pay an $8 million fine and has agreed to hire
an auditor to review its operations worldwide, to add to its staff
a vice president and officers for safety and environmental
problems, and to try to educate shippers, prosecutors and the
company announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   American will place a full-page advertisement in The Miami
Herald to apologize for its actions and will be on probation for
three years, during which a federal district court judge will
review its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Carty, chairman of the AMR Corp., the airline's parent
company, appeared in court in Miami Thursday morning to enter the
plea and said, ``This is not our proudest day.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven P. Solow, chief of the environmental crimes section of
the Justice Department, said in a telephone interview that this was
the first time a major airline had pleaded guilty to illegal
storage of hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
   The plea stemmed from an incident in July 1995 when a shipper
delivered a drum containing an ignitable chemical to American
Airlines in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Unloading the plane in Miami, airline workers rolled the drum on
its side to put it on a forklift truck, but the top came off and
the contents caught fire. Some airline employees exposed to the
smoke complained of dizziness and difficulty breathing, according
to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   The airline workers put out the fire, placed the contents back
in the drum and left it in an airline building, where it sat for
three years. That was the violation of hazardous-waste laws, for
which American pleaded guilty Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern, though, is chemical releases or fires aboard
planes in flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Airlines put their passengers and employees at risk
by handling hazardous materials in a dangerous way,'' said Lois
Schiffer, the assistant attorney general for the environment and
natural resources division.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Justice Department, American ``admitted that it
had placed hazardous materials on its passenger planes even though
its employees had information from shippers that should have caused
them to believe that the cargo should have been handled
differently.'' But the employees ``failed to make sufficient
inquiries or to simply reject these shipments,'' the department
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a former aircraft maintenance company, SabreTech, was
convicted in federal district court on eight charges growing out of
the crash of a Valujet Airlines DC-9 in the Florida Everglades on
May 11, 1996, for improperly handling the hazardous materials that
caused a fire on the plane. The crash killed all 110 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ValuJet crash, the Federal Aviation Administration has
been bringing civil cases for improper transportation of hazardous
materials, but mostly against shippers rather then airlines.

 &HT;    Teammates ready to play in Heritage, not watch it
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Roy Johnson, Warren Broughton and Ronnie Jones have
watched the Heritage Bowl from the stands the past two years.
Saturday, the trio of Hampton University players will be competing
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   As former standouts together in high school, the three were home
during the holidays and were easily able to attend the annual event
at the Georgia Dome. This year they're playing in the game, and
Johnson is one of the primary reasons why.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2, 180-pound Johnson threw for 1,940 yards and 10
touchdowns in leading the Pirates to a 7-4 record. Last season,
Johnson completed 53.6 percent for 1,892 yards in leading the
Pirates to a 9-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   One of the team's losses this year came against Southern, 21-6
in October. Johnson, who has already earned an undergraduate degree
and is enrolled in grad school, will enter Saturday's game
motivated by that loss and what he perceives as unkind words from
the opposition's camp leading up to this rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been preparing for Southern, hoping to have an
opportunity to play them again,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I don't know if it was as much Roy as it was his
receivers in that game. We literally dropped 10 balls,'' said
Pirates coach Joe Taylor, whose team won back-to-back MEAC titles
and represented the league in the Division I-AA playoffs in 1997
and '98. ``Our receiver corps, to me, may be our biggest
disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   The bright spot for the Hampton receivers has been Broughton,
who leads the team with 504 receiving yards on 31 receptions. The
other former Redan player, the 6-5, 325-pound Jones, anchors the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Other Georgians expected to play a big role for Hampton include
cornerback Rashad Muhyee and defensive linemen Damon and Ira Dawson
from Westlake High in College Park and offensive guard Jason Thomas
of Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   If the Pirates hope to gain a measure of revenge against
Southern, they will need a big game from Johnson, who will finally
get a chance to play in the game he has watched from the stands the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy has provided a lot of great moments for the Hampton
family, on and off the field,'' Taylor said. ``We've won two
conference championships, and he's helped our program move to the
level where we've received some national attention.''

FIGHTING AIDS IN INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Renee Loth  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUMBAI, India _ Rabiya is a prostitute in Kamathipura, the
red-light district in South Bombay. It is not an easy life. With a
going rate of 20 to 250 rupees per sex act (50 cents to $6.25), it
is almost impossible for her to work herself out of the job, and
now she and 15,000 other sex workers in Bombay have added AIDS to
their list of dangers and degradations. ``Some men offer us more
money not to use a condom,'' she said through a translator. ``We
try to make them understand that the illness is here.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Rabiya's life took on a new purpose. She was
recruited by Population Services International, a nongovernmental
organization, to join a sort of AIDS brigade. She was trained to
explain sexually transmitted diseases and the importance of using
condoms to her peers. Fresh-scrubbed and wearing uniform saris and
ID badges, Rabiya and about a dozen other streetwalkers look almost
like girl scouts. The impression is deepened when they greet a
group of foreign journalists with a chirpy, much-rehearsed chorus
of the spiritual ``This little light of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   But the work Rabiya and the others do is dead serious. Because
of India's 1 billion population, even a small percentage increase
in AIDS involves huge numbers of individuals. According to the UN
Program on AIDS, at least 4 million Indians are infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The red-light district project is an example of what is called
``social marketing'' _ the distribution of condoms, mosquito nets,
medicines, and other health aids vital to Third World countries.
When it comes to AIDS, social marketing targets people at high risk
_ prostitutes, long-distance truckers, prisoners _ and distributes
condoms and educational messages using everything from street
theater to mobile vans to key chains.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say social marketing is more effective than
government giveaways, which are often rejected as coercive, low in
quality, and ``unhip.'' Let's hope so for Rabiya's sake, India's,
and the world's.

NEWS ANALYSIS: BEHIND HARD-LINE TALK, A WILLINGNESS TO CONCEDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MIDEAST-TALKS, MIDEAST-U.S., MIDEAST-WESTBANK,

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing the cameras during a ceremony on Wednesday
meant to herald the resumption of Israeli-Syrian peace talks,
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria sounded every bit the
unreconstructed foe of the Jewish homeland.
</P>
<P>
   True to his genuinely hard-line persona, he did not make any
overtly conciliatory gesture, not even eye contact with Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel. This completely unnerved many
Israelis glued to their television sets for the historic moment,
although it reportedly heartened al-Sharaa's intended audience back
home.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, however, al-Sharaa did not display the same muscular
posture privately. Before the Israeli and Syrian leaders emerged
into the Rose Garden, they did shake hands, a senior Israeli
official said. Afterward, ensconced in the Blair House on Wednesday
and Thursday, the negotiations were ``not friendly, not hostile,
just businesslike,'' the Israeli said.
</P>
<P>
   Each side did indeed mean business, or the two would not have
bothered to break a 45-month freeze in talks. The proof lay in
Thursday's pledge: a genuine renewal of negotiations at an
accelerated pace.
</P>
<P>
   Although there may seem to be a puzzling inconsistency in
al-Sharaa's behavior, it fits a pattern in Israeli-Arab peace
negotiations. On every track, there is a private and public face to
the relationship. For both Israeli and Arab leaders, making peace
involves juggling two campaigns: one at the negotiating table, the
other on the home front.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations, concessions are inevitable. But publicly, some
leaders choose to present an implacable facade as defenders of
their own people's needs and rights.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this split posture serves the ultimate purpose of real
peace is debatable. It may help the parties reach a deal while
avoiding domestic discontent. But those who take this approach may
also be failing to educate their people, to prepare them for peace
by helping them move beyond deeply ingrained hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``By acting tough in public, you buy yourself some space to
negotiate in private,'' said Richard N. Haass, vice president of
the Brookings Institution, who was a staff member of the National
Security Council under President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the short run,'' he said. ``In the long run, you risk
emerging from negotiations with an agreement your population isn't
ready to buy. Or you limit yourself to a very spartan agreement so
people in the street don't see the signs of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question of whether a final peace achieved under
such conditions will be shallow or deep. Will it be nonbelligerence
or the genuine dawn of a new dynamic? Will it be a cool peace like
Israel has with Egypt 20 years after Camp David?
</P>
<P>
   The emotionally complicated relationship between the Israelis
and the Palestinians cannot be equated with the clearer-cut
conflict between the Israelis and the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Palestinian front, too, the officials' rhetoric can
often be belligerent at the same time that closed-door negotiations
with the Israelis are quite cordial. On the surface, judging from
the words, it can seem like a crisis. Behind the scenes, though,
progress is often being made.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Barak's predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, both
sincerely and with an eye on his conservative constituency, adopted
a hostile public personality toward the Palestinians and the Arab
world in general. Meanwhile, he was talking through a private
intermediary to the Syrians and negotiating peace deals with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In his case, the contradiction caught up with him. His
government fell last winter partly because of the discordance
between his actions and his words.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the people are readier to change than their leaders
think or want. Some experts, for instance, believe that Syria's
president, Hafez Assad, and his emissary, al-Sharaa, are trapped
inside decades of their own dogma, while the Syrian people, eager
for the changes that peace could bring an insular, stagnant
society, are more moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned diplomats say they do not have faith in a peacemaking
style in which leaders combine private pragmatism with a public
dialogue that is coarse or inflamed. Many think that peacemaking
should be accompanied by public diplomacy by the leaders _ each
side speaking both to its own people and to the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are catering to your home gallery, like al-Sharaa
did, you are undermining the other leader's support at home,'' said
Itamar Rabinovich, president of Tel Aviv University, a former
ambassador to the United States and a lead negotiator in previous
rounds of Israeli-Syrian talks.
</P>
<P>
   As president of Egypt, Anwar Sadat understood that he personally
had to campaign for Menachem Begin, the former Israeli prime
minister and his peace partner at Camp David. He went so far as to
journey to Jerusalem and address the Israeli Parliament. It helped
in Israel, but one Palestinian official recently said that he
believed Sadat, who was assassinated, to some extent paid for that
with his life.
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister who was assassinated
in 1995, made a point of telling his people how hard it was for him
to cross the threshold from enemy to peace partner with Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader. He made clear his discomfort with
their handshake, in a way that helped nudge Israelis along the path
he had traveled.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has made a point of using his public engagements in Israel
to reach out to Syrian and Palestinian leaders. In speeches to
Parliament, he has praised both Assad and Arafat. Telling
Palestinians that he is trying to see things through their eyes, he
has legitimized their suffering, which sends a strong message to
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Without such messages, people can be confused when their leaders
finally close a peace deal, and the peace itself can be fragile.

WHITE HOUSE SEEKS TO BLOCK RUSSIAN LOAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-CHECHNYA) 
(js) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House officials called Thursday on the
independent Export-Import Bank of the United States to delay or
cancel a pending $500 million loan package to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the aid, in the form of loan guarantees to a
Russian oil company for the purchase of U.S. equipment, should be
blocked because of allegations that the Russian company had
defrauded foreign investors in another deal.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said their position was not related to Russia's
war in Chechnya, but there has been a growing debate at the White
House and at the State Department about whether approval of the
transaction would send the wrong signal as the Russian army wages
an increasingly bloody conflict in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund, in which the United States is
the largest shareholder, is also continuing to withhold a $640
million loan to Russia because Russia has failed to meet the
necessary economic and financial conditions, though this
explanation has been greeted with skepticism by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Export-Import Bank is an independent agency whose charter
precludes it from making decisions based on political
considerations. It had scheduled a board meeting for Friday to vote
on the loan guarantees, but postponed the meeting until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bank makes its decisions independently of the
administration, the State Department can halt loans if it
determines that the recipient violates human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The guarantees are to go to Tyumen Oil Co., which has been
embroiled in a dispute with BP Amoco, one of the world's largest
oil producers, and investors including George Soros. The fight is
over Tyumen's acquisition _ at a bargain price through a bankruptcy
proceeding _ of an oilfield in which BP Amoco and Soros were part
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Another investor in the oilfield, the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, denounced the bankruptcy deal as a
``sham'' that raised questions about the Russian government's
commitment to attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the issue by reporters Thursday, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said, ``I have my people looking into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House took a harder line, clearly intending to
send a public signal to the bank even as White House officials said
the administration was not lobbying the bank.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   White House aides said that Gene Sperling, the director of the
National Economic Council at the White House, had concluded that
there was enough merit to the allegations that Tyumen had acquired
the oilfield in an unscrupulous manner that the bank should at
least delay its decision while the legal fight over the acquisition
goes forward.
</P>
<P>
   They said Sperling was concerned that going ahead with the loans
now could be perceived as a reward for a Russian company that had
undermined the country's halting efforts to develop laws and rules
for the conduct of business.
</P>
<P>
   The loans are tricky for the administration not just because of
the Russian assault on Chechnya. Vice President Al Gore's rivals in
the presidential race have intermittently raised questions about
whether he failed to act aggressively enough in demanding that
Russia clamp down on corruption.

SAN FRANCISCO CURATOR TAKES JOB AT MOMA 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH BAKER  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gary Garrels, chief curator at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art, has been appointed chief curator of drawings
and curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the hardest decision of my life, bar none,''
Garrels said. ``SFMOMA has extraordinary staff and one of the great
boards of any museum in the world. I'm always going to keep a close
relationship with the Bay Area. And I think MOMA in New York sees
SFMOMA as one of its key colleague institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   As New York MOMA's curator of drawings, Garrels will head a
nine-member department. ``As a curator within painting and
sculpture,'' he said, `n task will be to think about
acquisition strategies and collection presentation in tandem with
drawings.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrels formally assumes his new position in May but will be
actively involved in several SFMOMA projects already under way.
</P>
<P>
   They include retrospectives of American artists Sol LeWitt and
Robert Gober and a survey of the outstanding private collection of
Harry and Mary Margaret Anderson of Atherton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have some cushion for learning MOMA's huge drawing
collection,'' Garrels said, as MOMA will gradually gear down its
programs at the end of 2000 to permit expansion into an adjacent
53rd Street lot long occupied by the Hotel Dorset, a project to be
finished by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collecting activity will not be affected'' by MOMA's gearing
down, Garrels said. ``If anything, it will intensify.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrels, 48, came to SFMOMA in 1993 from the Walker Art Center
in Minneapolis. He is already well known in New York for having
been director of programs at Dia Center for the Arts, Manhattan's
leading private, nonprofit art institution, before his stint in
Minneapolis.

   WOODBURY, Conn. _ ``Are we going up there?'' I asked the young
woman with the clipboard and a name tag that said Rachel. I was
referring to what, in another season, would be a ski slope.
``Sure,'' she said. ``It's going to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel checked me in, painted a big ``3'' on my windshield,
demonstrated how to put my Land Rover in low range with the center
differential locked, and directed me to park near a sign that said
Borneo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It had started to rain, so the weather was perfect for an
off-roading event of Land Rover owners. A year ago, I had leased a
Discovery and was told that I would be invited to an outing the
dealership sponsors each fall. (I have since learned that this is
done by all Land Rover dealers. Some have events as often as four
times a year.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five events were set for the morning session _ an afternoon
session was planned, too _ including a cross-country trek in the
woods and a descent on a ski slope. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The morning group had 13 cars divided into four teams. I was on
the Borneo team with two other Discoverys and a Range Rover. Borneo
was first to take on the cross-country course, through the woods,
across a stream and into the mud. As it kept raining steadily, the
mud got slicker and deeper. We soon found out what Land Rovers can,
and more important, cannot, do.
</P>
<P>
   My car led the Borneo team and got through most of the course
pretty easily. It was not so easy, however, for my teammates, one
of whom had just spent a couple of hundred dollars getting her car
detailed. We learned how to push, pull tow and employ other
techniques for helping one another get unstuck.
</P>
<P>
   Team Borneo got almost all the way through the mud. All that
remained was a fairly short uphill section, then it would be all
downhill. I made a run at the hill, got almost to the top and lost
traction. I backed down, got up a head of steam and tried again.
This time, I got a little farther up, but lost traction and went
into a wheel-spinning slide sideways to the right, stopping so that
a tree wound up behind me. That was it. The rain had turned the
hill to something resembling grease and I couldn't go up or down. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The three vehicles behind me turned around and headed back out
the way they came, through the mud. I waited _ stuck _ where I was.
A tractor materialized on the hill above and pulled me out up the
hill. From there, I was able to complete the course, the only
driver to finish.
</P>
<P>
   My teammates were still in the woods, working their way out
through the mud. Getting them out required cutting some new paths
around the mud bogs. It had taken all morning to get through one
event. The rest of the day's adventures were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   I was wet and muddy and didn't get to go up or down the ski
slope. My Discovery was coated with mud, inside and out, but I had
had more fun with a car than I have had in a long time. And I
learned a lot more than I would have without the rain. &QL;

U.S. INDICTS MONEY MANAGER ON FRAUD AND KICKBACK CHARGES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.J.)   By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street money manager Alan B. Bond was indicted
Thursday on charges he took $6.9 million in kickbacks from
commissions paid to brokers to whom he steered his clients'
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Bond runs his own investment company and is also a regular guest
on the PBS's television program, ``Wall Street Week with Louis
Rukeyser.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11-count indictment returned in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan charged Bond with conspiracy, investment advisory fraud,
commercial bribery, and making false statements to the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends Bond, who is 38, had used three
brokerage firms to carry out his scheme from 1993 to 1998, having
them execute Nasdaq stock trades on behalf of his clients, then
taking kickbacks of 57 percent to 80 percent from commissions.
</P>
<P>
   A second man, Robert I. Spruill, a broker who worked at all
three brokerage firms, was charged Thursday with conspiracy and
fraud charges for his role in the scheme. The government contended
that he had set up a dummy corporation, called Satchmo Inc., which
was used to funnel commission kickbacks to Bond.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Bond could face five years in prison on each
count, said the office of Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in
Manhattan. The SEC, in a separate action, sued Bond, seeking
repayment of his gains and other civil penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The government contended Bond had concealed the scheme from the
clients he victimized, which included the National Basketball
Association, the City University of New York Investment Pool, and
several city pension and retirement funds, including the Washington
Metropolitan Transit Authority Retirement Plan Local 689, his
largest client. In all, his firm managed about $600 million for 25
clients, the authorities said. His firm's strategy focused on
growth securities.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment contended Bond had used the proceeds of his
crimes to ``maintain a lavish lifestyle.'' The authorities said
this included the refurbishing and decorating of his home, the
purchase of two vacation properties in Florida _ including a house
with a pool in Sarasota _ the purchase of 75 luxury and classic
automobiles, tickets to Broadway, and his Harvard Club dues.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, who lives in Montclair, N.J., has not yet been arraigned,
and he could not be reached by phone Thursday. His lawyer, John S.
Siffert, said his client would be entering a not guilty plea and
will be contesting the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that he will be vindicated,'' Siffert added.
</P>
<P>
   Spruill was released on his own recognizance Thursday by U.S.
Magistrate Judge Frank Mass after entering a not guilty plea. His
lawyer, Frederick P. Schaffer, had no comment.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An SEC spokesman, Clifford C. Hyatt, said the investigation of
Bond began when the agency's examiners discovered irregularities in
the books of Lintz Glover White &AMP; Co., a small broker-dealer in
Sherman Oaks, Calif. The firm, one of the three Bond ultimately
used in his scheme, was ``running a high volume of trades for a New
York money manager,'' Hyatt said, and was receiving high
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The trail led to an employee there, Spruill, and his use of the
dummy company to funnel money back to Bond. Bond was then president
and chief investment officer of Bond, Procope Capital Management in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Spruill, 52, of Newark, ultimately worked at each of the three
firms used in the scheme and ``played a critical role in
implementing Bond's advisory fraud,'' the SEC's lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond also instructed the brokerage firms not to report the
commissions or mark-ups he established on the confirmation and
account statements sent to his clients, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Caproni, Pacific regional director of the SEC, said in a
statement: ``By choosing to direct trades to these firms, Bond was
not only deciding when he received a kickback, he was also deciding
how much the kickbacks would be, while at the same time, preventing
his clients from detecting the scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Bond's clients were mostly pension funds, the victims
are human,'' Caproni added, ``People who believed that their
pension fund adviser was investing for their benefit not his.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond was also accused of taking kickbacks by misappropriating
hundreds of thousands of dollars in ``soft dollar'' credits, which
belonged to his clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft dollar'' credits are partial rebates of broker
commissions that may be paid back to investment advisers if they
are used on behalf of the client, such as for the purchase of
research reports or computer software. But Bond used this kickback
to pay his credit card bills and other personal expenses, the
government contended.
</P>
<P>
   The two other firms used by Bond were the Brenner Securities
Corp., a now defunct brokerage firm in New York, and Value
Investing Partners, of Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, a 1987 graduate of Harvard Business School, was an
associate with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. from 1987 to 1989, and a
portfolio manager for W.R. Lazard &AMP; Co. from 1989 to 1991, the SEC
suit said.
</P>
<P>
   He was president and chief executive of Bond, Procope from 1991
until late last year, when he bought out his partners, and
reconstituted the firm, now called Albriond Capital Management.

 &HT;    Bonfire 1998 crew caught drinking, records reveal
 &HT;    By Jason Spencer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ A year before the Texas A&AMP;M Bonfire
collapse, university police found dozens of bonfire workers with a
beer keg at the building site, documents released Thursday show.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 students, including 20 minors, were inside a storage
shed with a 15.5-gallon keg, and police believed they were
drinking, according to an offense report written Nov. 5, 1998. A&AMP;M
police called an ambulance for an 18-year-old student they found
passed out and vomiting on a sofa inside the shed, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The documents raised further questions about supervision ofAggie
Bonfire, where a log-stack collapse Nov. 18 killed 12 people and
injured 27. One, John Comstock, remained in critical condition
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials investigating the collapse have said they were not
aware of evidence showing alcohol was a factor in the accident, but
documents released by the university since the collapse show that
drinking during the preparation and burning of the bonfire has been
a concern for years.
</P>
<P>
   Toxicology reports found that two of those killed had
blood-alcohol levels well above the legal limit to drive a motor
vehicle in Texas. Evidence from the accident site shows several
beer cans were discovered either inside a truck or in a
construction shack.
</P>
<P>
   In March, A&AMP;M Vice President for Student Affairs J. Malon
Southerland wrote in a memo to other university officials, ``I
think we are dangerously close to having a serious incident that
connects alcohol, residence halls and Bonfire.''
</P>
<P>
   The following month, Ron Sasse, the university's director of
residence life, recommended ``a training effort to assist student
leaders ... to motivate others without using alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   A November 1998 memo and a copy of the police report were
addressed to Ben Welch, the university's director of student
affairs, from Brent Paterson, A&AMP;M director of student life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the information in the police report, I am forwarding
it to you for consideration of disciplinary charges against the
(Student Bonfire) organization. Since specific individuals were not
identified as `owners' of the keg, Student Life does not have any
plans for disciplinary charges against individuals related to
possession of the keg. However, we will pursue charges against
individuals cited for minor in possession and public
intoxication,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The document's second page contains what appear to be the
signatures of Bill Kibler, associate vice president for student
affairs, and Southerland. Under the signatures is a hand-written
note: ``This was handled by Blaine and Rusty,'' possibly referring
to Bonfire faculty adviser Rusty Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the students involved were likely disciplined for having
alcohol at the bonfire site, but it is unclear whether they were
allowed to continue working on the bonfire, said Cynthia Lawson, a
university spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   She said that when asked about it Thursday, Thompson could not
remember the 1998 incident or what kind of action was taken against
the students involved. Lawson said she does not know the identity
of ``Blaine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure what they did is they followed the university's
discipline procedures,'' Lawson said. ``Those procedures are pretty
strict. If it says, `Do A,' they do A.''
</P>
<P>
   Another document released Thursday shows that in April, Thompson
requested and received permission to hire a part-time graduate
student to provide hazing and alcohol awareness education programs
for the bonfire workers, as well as perform other administrative
duties. In the spring, Lawson said, Thompson hired a former bonfire
red pot _ construction leaders so named for the color of the
helmets they wear.

   Holiday Celebrations With an Extra Kick &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flush with cash from the booming economy, some companies are
going all-out to celebrate the holidays, and not just with parties.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent online survey of 531 employers, Vault.com, a company
that studies workplace issues, found that 32 percent said they were
planning more lavish events this holiday season than last.
</P>
<P>
   One company said it planned a millennium party in January at a
local restaurant, rather than in the company cafeteria, the usual
spot for gatherings. ``We've got more money to spend,'' a company
representative said.
</P>
<P>
   Another company said it was sponsoring a cruise to the Bahamas
for employees, while a third said it provided a cocktail
party-dinner-dance at a hotel for each employee and a guest, and
paid for those who wanted to spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   Just over half the respondents said parties would be about the
same as last year's; 16 percent said they would be less
extravagant. ``We don't do a party,'' a representative of one

CLINTON SAYS HE WILL SEEK TO CHANGE WAY `DON'T TELL' POLICY IS
USED 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MARC LACEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Addressing a sympathetic audience of gay and
lesbian backers of the Democratic Party, President Clinton said
Thursday that the way the military was implementing the ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy toward homosexuals in uniform could turn
soldier against soldier and that he intended to push for changes in
how the services put the policy into effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us what he's been telling us privately for two years _
that he doesn't like the policy but that it was the best he could
get politically,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the
Human Rights Campaign, a gay political group. ``The president
called it institutionalized hypocrisy and said it creates an
atmosphere of secrecy that turns soldier upon soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to about 50 gay men and lesbians at a
$10,000-a-plate luncheon sponsored by the Democratic National
Committee. In his speech, he ignored the ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy altogether, but after reporters were ushered out of the
room, the policy and how the services were carrying it out came up
in the closed question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to take a very close look at this and make sure it's
implemented right,'' said Julian Potter, the White House liaison to
the gay and lesbian groups.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis M. Dougherty, a gay Vietnam veteran who served in the
Army and is seeking to overturn the current policy, said he asked
Clinton whether he would sign an executive order lifting the ban on
gays in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty said Clinton then recounted the legislative standoff
that led to the compromise in which the military may not inquire
into a soldier's sex life unless there is clear evidence of
homosexual conduct. Clinton did not commit himself to a change in
policy, and Dougherty said that when he tried to press the issue,
he was cut off by the Democratic committee treasurer, Andrew
Tobias.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect an answer at the luncheon,'' said Dougherty, a
former Republican who switched parties after Clinton's election.
``But I do think he's looking at this issue. After all, it's his
legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Potter, the White House adviser, said Clinton was looking
for ways to improve the situation before leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if he could issue an executive order overriding
the law,'' Ms. Potter said. ``The White House counsel's office is
looking at that. My gut reaction is I don't think that can work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first criticized the implementation of the policy in a
radio interview last week after his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
said in New York that she believed that gays should be allowed to
serve openly. Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley
of New Jersey have called for the elimination of the
administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon this week ordered a 90-day review to determine if
gay service members were being harassed, a step that some advocates
for homosexuals criticized because Defense Department officials had
failed to promise confidentiality to those who reported harassment.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton urged gays to continue their support of
Democratic and administration efforts to pass hate-crimes
legislation next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you to stay with me and to make a good effort,'' Clinton
said. ``I think we've got a much better chance to pass it in 2000,
and I hope you will help me with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also urged the audience to work for the election of
Democrats in next year's congressional and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said many times I wish we could have done more,''
Clinton said, ``but I'm glad we did what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the luncheon in the Mayflower Hotel said Clinton
brought up the murder in July of Pfc. Barry Winchell at Fort
Campbell, Ky., as an indication of the current climate in the
military. Last week, Pvt. Calvin Glover was found guilty of
bludgeoning Winchell in their barracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes tragedy brings a greater spotlight,'' said Winnie
Stachelberg, the political director for the Human Rights Campaign.
``There are action-forcing events that happen in this country all
the time. If there is a silver lining in the tragedy of Barry
Winchell, we may be able to improve the lives of gay people who are
willing to die for their country but cannot openly serve.''

THE GENERATION GAP IN YEAR 2000 PLANS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If, as the Book of Proverbs says, the prudent see danger and
take refuge, but the simple keep going and suffer for it, then I
must be among the simple.
</P>
<P>
   I have given the Year 2000 computer issue approximately 8.2
minutes of thought _ and that was only to gauge the danger involved
in airline travel on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I'm unconcerned about a digital meltdown. I just
don't think there is much I can do about it. Besides, what's the
worst that can happen? If the electricity goes out, I'll buy
candles (scented, of course). If the banks crash, then I don't have
to pay bills. As for water, well, I prefer Diet Coke. A friend
looks at it this way: ``If the world ends, then I don't have to
worry about dating again.'' There's a silver lining to everything.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people, especially those in high-technology
industries, see Y2K as only a minor annoyance, if that. ``Sure,
I'll grab a few extra bucks from the ATM,'' they may say, or
``Yeah, I'll throw some extra soup in my food cart.'' But they see
no cause for panic: ``Hey, if the pilot's willing to get into the
cockpit, who am I to say no?''
</P>
<P>
   But many of our parents _ the same people who consider
programming a VCR a technological feat _ are piling their basements
with canned food and bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Van Couvering, 30, a senior strategist in the London
office of Organic, a San Francisco-based company that helps build
Web sites, said her mother ``wants to be on the safe side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She lives in a log cabin in New Mexico, on the Colorado
border, and as far as I know she's stockpiling food and getting
wood ready,'' Ms. Van Couvering said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Wolf, 27, president and founder of zUniversity.com, based in
Manhattan, which builds branded portals and online communities for
universities, is in a similar situation. ``I invited my mother,
who's a big football fan, to go to one of the college bowl games
with me on New Year's Day, and she refused, despite the fact that
we have box seats with the head of a university,'' he said. ``She's
been offered an amazing trip to New Orleans with her son and she
says no. I think she's been reading too many articles about Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   A person's Y2K fear may reflect a broader attitude toward
computer technology. To many older people, who think JavaScript has
something to do with coffee and cursive, high technology is
interesting but not quite relevant to daily life. To their
offspring, life without megabytes and RAM is inconceivable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother's really worried about her computer, while I have a
better sense about what's going to be affected by a Y2K bug, what's
not and what the consequences will be,'' Ms. Van Couvering said.
``Even if my PC is completely messed up, the most I'm going to have
to do is set the clock and download a patch,'' a program that fixes
software bugs.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just technology that has widened the gulf between young
and old; it's also life experience. Unlike our parents, my
generation didn't grow up with much sense of doom. They had the Bay
of Pigs; we have ``Baywatch.'' They had air-raid drills; we've got
air-fare wars. They lived through World War II and Vietnam; we
watched the Persian Gulf war, the mini-series. To us, much Y2K fear
has the feel of a made-for-TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   So who needs the worry? Not Natalie Faciane, an account
executive for the Portland, Ore., edition of the Employment Guide,
a free, help-wanted publication. ``Six months ago, my dad said
`We're not leaving the house on New Year's Eve, absolutely not,'''
she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few months, she said, her father, who is familiar
with potential Year 2000 glitches through his work at a
high-technology marketing firm, has been stuffing his California
home with water, food, batteries, a gas-powered generator, candles
and a hand-crank radio. Ms. Faciane said she believes he's
overreacting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's some truth to Y2K _ I've bought some food and
a hurricane lamp, which is always nice to have around _ but if we
constantly lived in fear we wouldn't be able to do anything,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   I agree. Still, you never know. Maybe there will be worldwide
blackout. As it happens, I'll be celebrating the millennium at a
chateau in the Loire Valley. If things go awry, I guess I'll be
stuck there. Perhaps the simple don't have to suffer after all.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Little can be said to change the minds of investors who believe
in the so-called new paradigm, the idea that today's stocks, for a
variety of reasons, should not be judged by historical valuation
standards. The believers generally ignore the skeptics, who gamely
point out that ignorance of such valuations in the past has almost
always been cause for regret.
</P>
<P>
   But the believers' reaction is hardly surprising. Indeed, a
historical argument is hardly relevant to people who think that
history itself is no longer relevant. ``This time is different,''
they often say.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone aiming to convert the paradigmistas, then, must do so
without referring to the historical norms of market valuation. Nor
should the argument be based on stocks' recent performance. After
all, it is impossible to know whether the recent gains in the
overall market are a result of the new paradigm or of extreme
overvaluation.
</P>
<P>
   But some assumptions underlying the new paradigm can be tested _
at least in how they should affect the relative operating
performance of small-capitalization value stocks and large-cap
growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s notwithstanding, small-cap stocks have historically
outperformed the large caps, and value stocks have outperformed
growth. But adherents of the new paradigm contend that the market's
leadership has changed permanently. Because of technological
advances and the economies of scale of a global marketplace, the
reasoning goes, small-cap value stocks should no longer be expected
to lead the market; only the very largest companies with the
biggest investments in technology will survive and thrive in the
new millennium _ the very growth companies that, indeed, have led
the market higher over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   But if the theory is correct, one would expect that large-cap
growth companies would have enjoyed extraordinary gains in
operating performance in recent years, both in absolute terms and
relative to small-cap value stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas were tested recently by three finance professors _
Louis K.C. Chan and Josef Lakonishok of the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign, and Jason Karceski of the University of
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   They focused particularly on the period since the end of 1995,
when stocks became grossly overvalued by almost all historical
valuation measures. They found that the new paradigm was an almost
complete failure in describing the recent operating performances of
public American companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sales growth is but one example. From the end of 1995 through
1998, sales of large-cap growth companies grew just 6 percent a
year, on average. That is not only lower than their historical rate
of 10.3 percent a year _ from 1970 through 1998 _ but also lower
than the 12.7 percent rate for small-cap value companies over the
same three years.
</P>
<P>
   A similar story emerges for operating income before
depreciation. For large-cap growth companies, this line item grew
9.6 percent, annualized, over that period, lower than their
historical rate of 10.6 percent and far below the 16.6 percent
annual rate for small-cap value companies over the same three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The data on net income is only slightly more encouraging for
new-paradigm believers. Before extraordinary items, profits at
large growth companies grew 11 percent, annualized, over the test
period _ higher than the historical growth rate of 9.6 percent. Yet
the growth was much slower than the 22 percent annual rate for
small-cap value companies.
</P>
<P>
   So if you are looking for evidence of a new paradigm at work,
the professors' study furnishes none. The conclusion is
inescapable: This time is not different.
</P>
<P>
   While advocates of the new paradigm come in varying degrees of
orthodoxy, that should give all of them reason to pause. Rather
than representing a brand-new world, the recent outsized gains of
large-cap growth stocks simply reflect overvaluation _ which the
market will correct in due course. &QL;

Everett deal sends disturbing signals
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   There are those of us who become frustrated even when we lose
mere pocket change between the cushions of the living room couch.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, we certainly feel Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr.'s pain
over losing a reported $120 million over the past seven years of
being a Major League Baseball owner.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that $120 million figure came about only after a
veritable olympiad of accounting gymnastics, we realize the man no
doubt has lost money and he should hope to recoup it.
</P>
<P>
   But the question today is one McLane has uttered hundreds of
times over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   What have you done today to become a champion?
</P>
<P>
   You have traded your best outfielder, Carl Everett, who arguably
also was your best overall player in 1999, for a Class AA shortstop
and a pitching prospect.
</P>
<P>
   You have hinted a trade of your best pitcher also might be
imminent, given Mike Hampton's decision to pass on a contract
extension in order to play out his free-agent options next season.
</P>
<P>
   Only months after talking openly about the World Series, you
have begun talking about the team being, ``in transition.'' You
have begun saying things like, ``building blocks'' and discussed
building bridges to where you want to be in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to today?
</P>
<P>
   You've taken a big chunk of your city's money and its citizens'
confidence in you and built a fancy new playpen. You've capitalized
on all the enthusiasm and Astros successes of the past three years
to market a hot new team logo and uniform design, just in time for
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   And now you've done this _ sent out a most interesting and
disturbing message to the citizens who helped give you the stadium
and money-making mechanism you now own.
</P>
<P>
   What have the Astros done today to become a champion? They have
taken a step backward.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, McLane has every right to begin recouping some of his
losses. For the sake of the future of baseball in this city, we
should all hope he eventually does.
</P>
<P>
   But we all also should ask, why such a desperate move and why
right now?
</P>
<P>
   Everett is a pivotal player and this is a pivotal time in the
history of the organization. It's not every season that a team
faces an opportunity to make it to the World Series, it's been 38
seasons and Astros fans still are waiting.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that not only has the players and general manager
in place to make a run to its first World Series, but definitely is
on the way toward putting a dent in McLane's fiscal shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   With the opening of Enron Field next spring, the club should for
the first time surpass the 3 million mark in attendance. Ticket
prices also will be higher, corporate suites will be filled and
McLane again will earn a sizable portion of concession and parking
revenue, not to mention a certain increase in marketing income
based on the new team logo.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there were a time McLane could have made one last sprint
for the ring, one last year of bullet-biting with the hope of it
paying off with the most illustrious of world championships, this
was it.
</P>
<P>
   He might still be in an overall fiscal hole given his previous
losses, but he does not figure to take a big hit in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The message we received with Tuesday night's trade of Everett
was a disturbing one and fans have every right to begin wondering
if they have been hoodwinked. It was a day when the Astros did
nothing to become a champion, instead likely took a step toward
mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a good Astros team in 2000, but it will not be a
better one. Should Hampton also be lost, it will be a stretch to
even consider the Astros favorites in the division.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Everett, the gifted shortstop acquired in the deal, will do
nothing to help this team become a champion in 2000. The outfield,
with the embattled Derek Bell, the talented but still unproven
Daryle Ward and Lance Berkman, and Moises Alou and Richard Hidalgo
coming off injuries, will dearly miss the reliable and gritty Carl
Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching staff could be decimated if it loses Hampton and it
is wondering about the viability of Scott Elarton, who's coming off
rotator cuff surgery.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the club could have been doing everything
possible toward christening The Gashouse with another division flag
or maybe even a National League pennant in 2000, it has us
wondering if it is on the way toward joining the likes of the San
Diego Padres and Florida Marlins by raising a white flag.

 Adobe Systems' Net Income Soars 94%, President to Retire  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Adobe Systems, which has lately been making a habit of beating
analysts' expectations, did it again yesterday, reporting
surprisingly strong results for its fourth fiscal quarter.
<P>
   The news pushed the company's shares up almost 10 percent in
after-hours trading _ even though Adobe also announced that its
president and co-founder, Chuck Geschke, will soon retire.
</P>
<P>
   Net income for the quarter, which ended December 3, jumped 94
percent to $97.4 million (76 cents per share) from $50.3 million
(39 cents) in the same period last year. Excluding investment gains
of $61.7 million and other nonrecurring charges, earnings for the
quarter were 46 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The average prediction among analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial was 42 cents. The ``whisper numbers'' _
estimates provided by some analysts to major clients and posted on
investor Web sites _ were as high as 45 cents, according to
Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fifth consecutive quarter in which Adobe's results
exceeded analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues for the quarter reached a record $281.8 million, up 14
percent, from $246.7 million in the last three months of last year.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, revenues were $1.015 billion _ the first time in
the San Jose company's history that they'd topped $1 billion. Net
income for the year was $237.8 million, a 126 percent jump from
$105.1 million in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obviously a great quarter,'' said analyst Jennifer
Smith of Dain Rauscher Wessels in San Francisco, ``but we weren't
really surprised because they'd been doing such a great job over
the last three quarters. They've been doing really well in
executing their new-product initiatives as well as in containing
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Geschke, 60, will retire as president of the company at the end
of March but will continue to serve as co-chairman of the board,
alongside CEO John Warnock. Warnock will add the title of
president. The two men founded the company in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Geschke achieved celebrity, of sorts, in 1992, when he was
kidnapped from an Adobe parking lot and held bound and blindfolded
for four days. He was freed after one of the kidnappers was caught
by the FBI and confessed.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement yesterday, Warnock attributed Adobe's growth to
``increased demand for Web content creation and delivery.'' In the
past year the company has released new versions of Photoshop, its
industry-leading image-editing program, and Acrobat, a series of
utilities used to publish electronic documents with graphics,
layout and typographical features intact.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in September Adobe delivered a new program called
InDesign, which is used for laying out newspapers and magazines.
That market is currently dominated by Quark Inc. of Denver, but
Adobe's new entry has received good reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for them in the next year will be to break out
of their traditional base in publishing,'' said analyst Smith.
``One thing we're looking for is more endorsement for their
Web-site development tools from the Web-building community.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Web development market, Adobe faces competition from a
number of companies, including San Francisco's Macromedia. But
another longtime rival, Metacreations Corp., earlier this week
announced plans to abandon the graphics-application market. The
Carpinteria company, which has not recorded a profitable year since
1993, will sell off most of its programs to concentrate its
resources on technology for streaming video from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe reported its results after the close of regular trading,
during which its shares had risen $1.88, to $63.75. After the
announcement, prices on after-hours exchanges exceeded $70 at
times, before settling back to $69.69.

 Bay Area Leads the Way in Use of Computers, Internet  &HT;     By Carrie Kirby 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The Bay Area dwarfs the rest of the nation when it comes to using
computers and the Internet, according to a poll of the nine-county
region conducted by an organization of local employers.
<P>
   Nearly 8 in 10 people surveyed said they use computers
regularly, and 62 percent have e-mail addresses. By contrast, only
one-third of people nationwide have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The survey asked about 600 people about their overall
perceptions of the quality of life in the area, and specifically
examined use of the Internet and attitudes about the housing
shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Sunne Wright McPeak, president and CEO of the Bay Area Council,
which conducted the survey, noted that the high Internet use is
spread evenly through almost all counties in the region. ``It's not
just Multimedia Gulch or Silicon Valley,'' she said. Alameda lagged
slightly behind other counties in the number of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   The results show that although the Bay Area is the nation's most
wired region, it's not immune to the Digital Divide _ the gap in
Internet use between lower and upper income groups. More than 80
percent of Bay Area residents making more than $80,000 thousand  &LR; a
year use the Internet, while only 46 percent of those whose annual
income is less than $40,000 regularly log on. The survey did not
divide respondents by ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   The prevalence of Internet use in the Bay Area actually makes
the Digital Divide here more acute, said David Geilhufe, director
of Oakland's Eastmont Computing Center/OCCUR, a program that helps
at-risk youth and other disadvantaged people learn about computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there are so many people in the Bay Area using
computers, public services are using the Internet. The people who
can use computers are getting the full benefits of these services,
and the people who can't are blocked from jobs and other benefits
of economic development,'' Geilhufe said.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area residents feel good about the economy, with 52 percent
saying their families are financially better off now than they were
in 1998. Despite that optimism, respondents recognize that the
area's housing shortage and transportation woes threaten future
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-six percent agree that increasing affordable housing is
important to the economy's health, and in almost all counties,
people identify transportation as the region's No.1 problem. San
Francisco residents call another issue equally important as
transportation: homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   But while more than half say new housing should be encouraged in
the Bay Area, the survey revealed what McPeak called ``deep
ambivalence'' when it comes to developing housing in peoples' own
neighborhoods. Only 47 percent throughout the region say new
housing should be encouraged in their communities. North Bay
respondents are even less enthusiastic, with 58 percent against new
housing.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area Council is an organization of area employers. Its
annual poll questions people over the age of 18 living in six Bay
Area regions: Alameda, Contra Costa, San Francisco, San Mateo and
Santa Clara counties, and the North Bay, which lumps together the
counties of Marin, Napa, Solano and Sonoma.

 Alza Deal Collapses _Stock Tumbles  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Palo Alto's Alza Corp. yesterday called off its troubled merger
with Abbott Laboratories, sending Alza's stock price down 30
percent in after-hours trading yesterday.
<P>
   In an announcement after the close of trading, Alza chief
executive Ernest Mario said the deal was scuttled because Federal
Trade Commission investigators had concerns about the antitrust
implications of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became pretty clear that we could not meet the requirements
of the FTC,'' Mario told analysts in a conference call.
</P>
<P>
   The official explanation glossed over the fact that the deal had
been on the rocks ever since Abbott revealed, one week after the
merger announcement, that its manufacturing processes were the
target of a Food and Drug Administration investigation.
</P>
<P>
   That startling revelation prompted a series of class-action
lawsuits alleging that Alza shareholders had been duped, and sent
the stocks of both firms into a swoon that steadily whittled away
the value of what had been touted as a $7.3 billion transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Alza said it would take a $10 million to $15 million charge to
cover a payment it will have to make to Abbott for canceling the
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in Alza had been halted earlier in the day after its
shares started to tumble on speculation that the troubled merger
had finally fizzled. Alza was pounded in after-hours trading,
plunging $12.25, to $27.38.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Abbott shares rose 12 percent to $40 in late
trading after the news broke.
</P>
<P>
   Like Alza, Abbott maintained that the deal was canceled because
of antitrust issues and had nothing to do with the fact that Abbott
recently paid a $100 million fine, the largest civil penalty of its
kind, to end the FDA's investigation into its diagnostic device
plant in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together with Alza, we have worked diligently over the last
five months to successfully resolve the issues with the FTC but
could not reach a solution that was in the best interests of our
shareholders,'' Abbott chief executive Miles White said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Now a question mark hovers above Alza, one of the Bay Area's
largest and oldest drug discovery firms. Best known for its
NicoDerm anti-smoking patch, it remains one of the region's few
profitable drug firms, with 1998 earnings of $112.3 million on
revenues of $585.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Alza employs 2,000 people, including about 1,300 in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a wounded company,'' said analyst David Steinberg with
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown in San Francisco. ``Morale has got to be
low and they're going to need a new management team to come in and
bolster the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said Alza still has the resources to try a turnaround
on its own, but speculation on Wall Street will be that having been
left at the altar by Abbott, it will look around for a better
match.

IN ETHICS, IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the holidays approaching, and after a grueling season
setting up fund-raising campaigns, Kathleen E. Pavelka, chief
executive of Telecomp in Rochester, decided to do something special
for her clients. She sent each of them a $50 American Express gift
check with a note: ``For all the evenings spent at work, please
enjoy an evening out on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a few days, 2 of the 20-odd recipients returned the
checks, saying that accepting them would violate their
organizations' policies. ``It was embarrassing,'' Ms. Pavelka said.
``I only realized in hindsight that several of the clients had a
policy of accepting no more than $25 value gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   But set aside the etiquette aspect for a moment. Gift policies
are ostensibly about ethical behavior. Were the two returners
hewing to a higher ethical standard?
</P>
<P>
   Gifts given and received stir up a witches' brew of conflicting
impulses and desires, in business no less than in personal
relationships. Imperatives of manners, obligations, reciprocity and
appropriateness converge on the giving of a business gift (here
defined as gifts to people at other organizations _ clients,
suppliers, potential customers, and so on _ and not gifts to
co-workers).
</P>
<P>
   Most people say it feels nice to get a present, or to give one.
That is a big reason they are given at all, though far from the
only one. Setting any limits on such a pleasant practice feels
Grinch-like. So it helps to remember that it isn't the gift that
presents the ethical problem; it is what is implicitly expected in
return.
</P>
<P>
   And something is always expected, whether it is getting to
deliver a pitch ahead of a stingier _ oops, make that ``less
thoughtful'' _ rival, or being ``taken care of'' when a vital
component is in short supply, or getting calls returned the same
day.
</P>
<P>
   On the receiving side, many companies want to send a message
that their favor cannot be curried this way. But they don't want to
seem mean and puritanical. A usual result is a compromise: a dollar
ceiling like the one Kathleen Pavelkas fell afoul of.
</P>
<P>
   Executives who develop such policies, like Patrick J. Gnazzo,
vice president for business practices at United Technologies, in
Hartford, acknowledge that there is nothing magic about the
amounts. (In his company's case, gifts worth $50 or more and meals
worth $100 or more must be reported to a supervisor.) ``But you
have to set a number,'' he said, ``and it's what we considered to
be a reasonable number.''
</P>
<P>
   But do ceilings, however practical, get to the root of ethics
issues? To borrow the old punchline, once you are willing to accept
a gift meant to alter your commercial behavior, everything else is
just quibbling over price.
</P>
<P>
   Gnazzo's company has a major exception to its policy: Employees
in procurement cannot accept gifts at all. But it is a ban rooted
as much in cool business calculus as in ethics. ``We would rather
have the product be a product that is priced fair,'' Gnazzo said of
the company's relationships with suppliers. ``We don't need them to
entertain us and buy us gifts, because that all goes into the cost
of the product.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people argue that businesses cannot afford to buck the
culture. Gnazzo is not alone in observing that if a company
chairman were to visit a country where ``gifts are being given and
are customary, we're going to bring a gift and we're going to
receive a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the gift is passed on to charity after the chairman
flies home, the fact that gifts are expected in the course of
business suggests that the practice is more than social nicety.
</P>
<P>
   A telltale sign of ethical trouble is a policy that is harsher
on receiving gifts than on giving them. In a 1996 survey, two out
of five executives at large public companies said their companies
had such double standards.
</P>
<P>
   Strict no-gifts policies _ bans on giving or receiving _ may
seem impractical, though Wal-Mart Stores seems to manage. It has
banned gifts and gratuities of any value since its founding in
1962, to no obvious ill effect. ``Our relationships with our
suppliers are very strong, very healthy and mutually respectful,''
said John Bisio, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There may indeed be little real harm in accepting, say, a $40
bottle of wine from a supplier or sending a $60 ham to a client.
Maybe you can remain impartial afterward; who, after all, can be
bought so cheap? But why not stop pretending that there is a bright
line between safe and unsafe business gifts, and acknowledge that
they all come with strings attached? Then, at least, you are being
honest about it _ as long as you declare them to the IRS. &QL;

 Genentech Plans Final Tests on Cancer Drug  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Genentech Inc. said yesterday that it plans to proceed with the
third and final stage of clinical trials aimed at developing a new
class of drugs that would fight cancer by cutting off the flow of
blood to tumors.
<P>
   Company officials and Wall Street analysts said it could be
years, if ever, before these experiments prove successful against
lung, colon and rectal tumors. But yesterday's announcement means
Genentech is still in the race to develop a new class of drugs,
called anti-angiogenesis agents, that have been hyped as possible
cancer cures.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long known that tumors can't grow larger than a
pinhead without forming new blood vessels to nourish them. Many
scientists, notably Harvard University's Dr. Judah Folkman, have
sought drugs to interrupt this process of blood vessel formation,
called angiogenesis.
</P>
<P>
   Although Folkman received widespread publicity last year for
some promising results in animal experiments of an
anti-angiogenesis drug called endostatin, other efforts, sponsored
by biotech firms like Genentech, are were  &LR; actually much further
along in testing anti-angiogenic drugs on humans.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in this approach is intense. The National Cancer
Institute (www.nci.nih.gov) lists 19 clinical trials for  &LR; underway
to test  &LR; anti-angiogenesis drugs on human cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Pluda, a senior investigator with the National Cancer
Institute, said these 19 experiments represent three broadly
different strategies for inhibiting blood vessel formation.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy that is furthest along in clinical trials is one
that attempts to prevent tumors from drilling tiny holes in the
matrix of flesh around the cancer site _ a prerequisite to
blood-vessel growth.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies working on this strategy are Agouron
Pharmaceuticals of La Jolla (San Diego County) and Aeterna
Laboratories of Quebec. They are already in phase III trials of
matrix inhibitors in lung and colorectal cancers, according to the
cancer institute.
</P>
<P>
   A second strategy, and the one Genentech employs, attempts to
interrupt the signals that cancer cells send out to call for new
blood vessels to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech, which plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration
for permission to begin phase III trials on this approach next
year, will face stiff competition from its South San Francisco
neighbor, Sugen Inc., which is a couple of months further along in
testing a similar strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The third broad anti-angiogenic strategy seeks to stop
endothelial cells from building small blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman's endostatin drug, which recently began first-stage
human tests, falls into this category. Another contender in this
third approach is Thalidomide, once reviled for causing birth
defects, but now being explored as a possible tumor-suppressor.
</P>
<P>
   Although none of these experiments has received FDA approval,
cancer fighters are hopeful that at least some of them will pan
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cautiously optimistic anti-angiogenesis may yield
positive results and become a useful weapon in our war on cancer,''
Pluda said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, Genentech is expected to announce,
perhaps as early as today, that based upon positive phase III
trials, it plans to ask for FDA approval for an asthma-fighting
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech investors cheered the anti-angiogenesis news, lifting
the company's shares $5.63, to $113.69. Genentech's stock has more
than doubled since July.

 11-Digit Bay Area Calls Voted Down  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Bay Area telephone customers scored a major victory yesterday
against a controversial plan that would have required them to dial
11 digits for a local call.
<P>
   In a 3-to-2 decision, the California Public Utilities Commission
permanently halted several ``overlay'' plans scheduled statewide,
including those in the 415, 408, 650 and 510 area codes, plus the
714 area code in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in those locales had been scheduled to begin 11-digit
dialing over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a great move,'' said Natalie Billingsley, an
analyst with the PUC's Office of Ratepayer Advocates. ``The
commission has made a very consumer-friendly decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Overlays are designed to deal with a growing shortage of phone
numbers caused by the proliferation of cell phones, pagers and
other communications devices.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to a ``split'' _ dividing a region geographically
and giving customers in one half a new area code _ an overlay lets
existing customers keep their area code and assigns a new area code
to new phone lines. The downside is that everyone in the overlay
area must dial 11 digits _ 1 plus the area code and seven-digit
phone number _ on every call, even when making calls within their
own area code.
</P>
<P>
   As a remedy, the commission instituted ``number conservation
measures,'' such as allocating numbers to phone companies in
smaller blocks and requiring phone companies to give back unused
numbers to slow down the depletion of numbers within the affected
codes.
</P>
<P>
   Although phone companies favor overlays _ saying they are
simpler than forcing consumers to switch to a new area code _ the
public has come out staunchly against them.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Pink, a San Francisco resident who lived through an area
code change from 408 to 831 in Santa Cruz, said both splits and
overlays ``create a lot of confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing commissioner Joel Hyatt said yesterday's action
essentially does away with the possibility of overlays statewide
for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy of the commission is now clear,'' Hyatt said in an
interview after the vote. ``We now have a policy in California to
take whatever conservation measures are possible to prevent the
rapid exhaustion of numbers, so people aren't going to continue to
be inconvenienced by dialing 11 digits when making a call.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyatt, PUC president Richard Bilas and Carl Wood approved the
measure. Commissioners Josiah Neeper and Henry Duque voted against
it.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement before the vote Duque said, ``conservation
measures, however helpful, cannot solve the number problem in
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Duque said he doesn't know the solution to the state's number
crisis but believes barring overlays is futile, particularly in
area codes like Los Angeles' 310 where numbers are severely
depleted.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, yesterday's vote doesn't preclude area code splits in
the future. In a separate action, the commission approved a
three-way area code split for the 707 area code (Sonoma, Napa and
Solano counties) beginning in December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there will be a need in some areas for a new area
code,'' said Regina Costa, a telecommunications analyst with the
Utility Reform Network. But yesterday's vote ``means that the
commission prefers to do splits where it's feasible, eliminating
the need for overlays.''
</P>
<P>
   Costa said the decision, while expected, signals a change in the
regulatory body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of focusing on dealing with these situations on a
crisis-by-crisis basis, they're coming up with a strategic plan for
dealing with numbers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several rulings this fall set the stage for yesterday's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   In early November, PUC administrative law judge Thomas Pulsifer,
recommended ending the overlays, saying they cause confusion and
disruption among customers.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal followed PUC's decision to end the state's first
overlay in the 310 area code. The overlay, which began in April in
the West Los Angeles region, caused severe problems and prompted a
huge consumer outcry. After it went into effect, customers were
unable to get through to some phone numbers and some security
systems did not work with 11-digit dialing.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsifer said that experience, combined with a recent decision
by the Federal Communications Commission that gives California more
flexibility in how it assigns phone numbers, should preclude the
need for overlays across the state.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the FCC gave California the right to hand out new
numbers to phone companies in blocks of 1,000 instead of 10,000.
The FCC also told the state it could require phone companies to
return any unused phone numbers back to a pool so they could be
reassigned to other phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is when ``pooling'' will begin in the Bay Area.
The 310 area code is scheduled to begin the practice in March.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how that trial goes, pooling in the 408 area code
could begin as early as late next year, followed by 415 and 650 and
finally, 510, according to Billingsley. Pooling only affects phone
companies. For consumers, it wouldn't make any difference in their
service.

   Abbott Labs Is Abandoning $7.3 Billion Deal for Alza
</P>

   Abbott Laboratories, the nation's largest maker of medical
diagnostic devices, said that it was abandoning its $7.3 billion
acquisition of Alza, a developer of drug delivery technologies,
because of antitrust opposition from the Federal Trade Commission.
The development is the latest in a string of trouble for Abbott,
including a record $100 million fine levied in October by the Food
and Drug Administration connected to the manufacture of medical
test kits.

   Ex-Giants Star Awarded $10 Million
</P>
<P>
   A jury in Newark, N.J., awarded more than $10 million to Philip
J. McConkey, the former New York Giants football player, after
finding that Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the group that runs the
Nasdaq stock market, deceived McConkey into working for him at
Alexander &AMP; Alexander, the insurance brokerage firm that Zarb
formerly ran. The six-person jury unanimously found that Zarb
fraudulently misled McConkey about the status of takeover talks
between the firm and the Aon Corp.

   Trade Deficit Set Record in October
</P>
<P>
   The nation's trade deficit swelled again in October, to $25.9
billion, setting a record for the seventh time this year as
prosperous consumers and businesses kept up their spending spree.
Exports were essentially unchanged, while imports continued to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   Yields Increase Sharply on Bonds
</P>
<P>
   Long-term interest rates jumped to their highest levels in more
than two years as the persistent strength of the nation's economy
convinced more and more investors that the Federal Reserve might
have to raise interest rates. The yield on the 30-year issue jumped
to 6.39 percent from 6.32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index set its 53rd record this year,

PLAYER ACCUSED IN GIRLFRIEND'S MURDER AGREES TO EXTRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Rae Carruth, the former wide receiver for the
Carolina Panthers, was brought shackled and in prison clothes into
a courtroom in Jackson, Tenn., on Thursday and agreed to return to
North Carolina to face charges that he engineered the murder of his
pregnant girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth had disappeared after his girlfriend, Cherica L. Adams,
died on Tuesday of gunshot wounds she suffered in a drive-by
shooting last month; it became apparent that Carruth, who had been
charged with attempted murder and released on $3 million bail,
would be charged with murder instead.
</P>
<P>
   But his flight did not last long. Acting on a tip given to the
Charlotte police, federal agents captured him Wednesday night in
the parking lot of a motel in Wildersville, Tenn., hiding in the
trunk of a car. He was traveling with an unidentified woman who has
not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief hearing before U.S. District Judge James Todd,
Carruth said he would not fight attempts to extradite him to
Charlotte to stand trial. ``I'm going to voluntarily go back,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth, 25, was turned over to federal marshals after the
hearing, but it was unclear when he would be transported to North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth is the first active National Football League player to
be charged with murder, according to the Football Hall of Fame. If
convicted, he faces either life in prison or the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers cut Carruth from the team Thursday, Coach George
Seifert announced, because he had fled the state. As a condition of
his bail, Carruth had been ordered by the court to turn himself in
if either Adams or her baby died. The Panthers had suspended
Carruth without pay after his arrest, under NFL rules, but he was
still a team member. Thursday the NFL suspended him indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a court order that was broken,'' Seifert said.
``This thing is beyond football.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Adams was only six and a half months pregnant when she
was shot on Nov. 16, doctors delivered her son by Caesarean
section, and the infant has survived. He was listed in fair
condition Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The three other men charged with conspiring with Carruth to kill
Adams were arraigned on murder charges in Charlotte on Thursday. A
judge revoked bail for all three: Michael Eugene Kennedy, 24;
Stanley Drew Abraham, 19, and William Edward Watkins, 44.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry Caudill, the lead prosecutor, said the district
attorney's office is considering asking for the death penalty for
all four defendants in the case, but had not made a final decision.
In North Carolina, a judge must hold a special hearing to determine
whether a murder is heinous enough to warrant capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors have remained tight-lipped about the
evidence linking Carruth to the killing, but a picture is beginning
to emerge, from preliminary hearings and police accounts, of a
premeditated and carefully orchestrated attack on Adams.
</P>
<P>
   After a night out with Carruth, Adams was driving her black BMW
at 12:30 a.m. on Nov. 16 when a rented car pulled up alongside it
and a man fired several shots from a handgun, striking her four
times in the neck and face, police said. She drove her car up on a
lawn and called police from a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   It was that initial conversation with a police dispatcher, along
with statements she made to detectives later that day at the
hospital, that led the police to suspect Carruth's involvement.
Carruth's cellular telephone records led detectives to the other
three defendants, some of whom have since made statements
implicating the football player, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' mother, Saundra Adams, told The Associated Press on
Thursday that Carruth had broached the topic of abortion with her
daughter early in the pregnancy, but did not pressure her. The two
had been dating for a year, but did not live together. Later,
Saundra Adams said, Carruth seemed to be excited about the prospect
of a child and even went with the future mother to several prenatal
checkups.
</P>
<P>
   His attitude changed, however, when he sprained his ankle about
two months ago and was taken out of the Panthers' lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed more pressured after his injury,'' Saundra Adams
told The Associated Press. ``More pressured about money and how
much the baby was going to cost him.''

WITH EYE ON FUTURE, WEB FIRMS AND TRADITIONAL RETAILERS TEAM UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Electronic commerce, explosive as it is, clearly can't keep
growing by going solo.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that they cannot grab the next generation of Web users
without each other, Internet companies and the biggest earthbound
retailers have buried the hatchet and are rushing to do business
together. In the latest such partnerships, Wal-Mart Stores, the
world's largest retailer, and Best Buy, the nation's largest
electronics merchant, both announced far-reaching alliances with
Internet companies on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the deals differed considerably, but the point
was the same: Retailers are looking for fast ways to help their
online stores, and everyone is looking to tap the two-thirds of
Americans who are not yet online, but are expected to get there
soon. Real-world merchants are thought to be especially influential
with the mass-market customer, who is less technologically savvy
than today's high-income Internet user and will be looking for
guidance about venturing into e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that 50 percent of Americans are outfitted with computers
and the majority of them are online,'' said Richard Schultze, Best
Buy's chairman, ``the next wave of new users are coming from those
consumers that are less knowledgeable and are somewhat less
prepared to spend a lot of money, but don't want to be left out.
Those are the consumers that retailers like ourselves have a strong
relationship with.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the recent spate of deals tacitly acknowledges a
new balance of power between Internet companies and traditional
stores, which just a year ago were being dismissed as dinosaurs.
``Six months ago Circuit City would have had to pay $50 million for
the agreement they got for free from AOL'' on Wednesday, said Gary
Balter, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. He was
referring to a deal in which Circuit City Stores, the nation's No.
2 electronics retailer, agreed to promote America Online's Internet
service in its stores in return for AOL featuring Circuit City's
online store as an ``anchor tenant'' on its shopping page.
</P>
<P>
   ``These deals follow a pattern going on all over the Internet,
which is the realization that online companies need to relate to
people who spend their lives both online and off-line,'' said Scott
Heiferman, founder of iTraffic, an Internet advertising company
recently bought by Agency.com.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, such retail-Internet partnerships are not a new
phenomenon. AOL, in particular, has aggressively mined the retail
channel for customers for half a decade now _ most notably through
Blockbuster Video and Barnes &AMP; Noble. But the teaming-up is
certainly gaining steam, and the size and the scope of the
partnerships are growing significantly.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with the broadest scope is the pact Wal-Mart signed
Thursday with AOL, by far the largest Internet service provider,
with nearly 20 million subscribers. Wal-Mart attracts some 100
million customers to its stores each week, and analysts estimate
that only 25 percent of those shoppers now have access to the
Internet at home. In the short term, the two giants will offer
low-cost software that will allow Wal-Mart customers to gain access
to the Web through a joint Web site. The financial details were not
disclosed, but analysts said that AOL would keep the fees but pay
Wal-Mart a bounty for each customer who signs up for the joint
service through Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   More interestingly, the two giants said they would also work
together to bring access to underserved rural customers. Wal-Mart
estimates that over half of its customers live in rural areas where
they cannot get access to the Web through a local phone call.
</P>
<P>
   While the Wal-Mart deal might reach the largest number of
Americans without access, it is but one approach to converting the
unwired masses. Best Buy agreed Thursday to market Microsoft's
newest wave of digital products and Internet access service in
return for a $200 million investment. Best Buy reaches a smaller
total customer base than Kmart or Wal-Mart, but its sales staff
specializes in educating shoppers on complicated home electronics.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Kmart agreed to create a co-branded Web shopping
site and Internet access software with Yahoo, a leading Web portal.
Kmart plans to give away that software, a deal that might be
particularly appealing to low-income customers. Kmart says that
some 30 million customers shop in its stores each week and that
only 51 percent now use the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In return for hawking the co-branded services, the traditional
merchants will have their Web sites featured prominently on the
sites of their Internet partners. Wal-Mart in particular is looking
to launch its Web site, which has not been a star performer, into
the top five most-trafficked sites. The giant retailer has been
losing sales to virtual retailers like eToys and Amazon in toys,
books and entertainment and, analysts say, wants to stem the tide.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not all traditional merchants have joined this
cross-marketing craze. Among the big players who are obviously
absent in this love fest are Target, the chic discounter that is a
unit of Dayton Hudson, and Sears, Roebuck, the second-largest
retailer, which once spent hundreds of millions of dollars in an
unsuccessful, decadelong online foray as a co-owner of Prodigy.
Analysts agree that it is not a deadly sin for earthbound retailers
to stay out of this game. ``If you are Sears and you don't have the
agreement, it is not that crucial, you are not going to die,''
asserts Balter of Donaldson, Lufkin.
</P>
<P>
   But a smart-looking Web strategy can be a means toward making a
land strategy more competitive. ``Deals like this drive up your
stock price so that you can increase budgets for online or on-land
development,'' said Burt Flickinger III, the managing director of
Reach Marketing, a Connecticut-based consulting firm. ``That gives
a retailer a huge strategic advantage.''

IN SURPRISE, REFORMISTS IN RUSSIA LOOK STRONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ If you think it's easy being a pro-Western, pro-market
politician in Russia these days, get an earful of the first
question asked Anatoly M. Chubais during a radio interview this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a widespread attitude,'' the interviewer said, ``that
you have brought the country to the point of collapse _ taken the
economy to an extreme, `done animal experiments,' that you are
`laboratory scientists who do not know what life is,' that you have
`with the cruelty of vivisectors' pushed millions of people beyond
the poverty line. Why should people vote for you?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a bad question.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais, the former deputy prime minister who drew Russia's
capitalistic cold bath in the early 1990s, embodies policies that
spawned a handful of super-rich tycoons and a boundless indigent
class before the economy collapsed in a speculative heap in 1998.
In a competition for the most reviled man in Russia, he would be a
triple threat.
</P>
<P>
   So it is worth asking why Chubais' latest creation, the Union of
Right Forces, seems poised to achieve what has been denied the vast
majority of Russia's political factions: winning its own bloc of
parliamentary seats in this Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The answer seems to be that the free-market theorists behind the
Union of Right Forces are proving considerably more adept at
playing power politics than they were at running an economy.
</P>
<P>
   Russian political parties can only win representation in the
lower house of parliament if they can collect at least 5 percent of
Sunday's vote. In the final pre-election polls conducted last
weekend and released Thursday, the Union of Right Forces registered
7 percent, and was gaining.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem unlikely for a political faction that did not even
exist before late this summer and whose headliners _ Chubais,
former deputy prime minister Boris Nemtsov and former prime
minister Sergei Kiriyenko _ were all forced out by President Boris
N. Yeltsin for their roles in last year's economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But Chubais, a central strategist in Yeltsin's come-from-behind
re-election victory in 1996, has prospered by making strengths out
of weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   If the West is widely blamed here for hastening Russia's
economic collapse and suspected of profiting from its decline, a
quarter of all Russians still aspire to European and American
lifestyles. And at least 10 percent still want to adopt immediately
Western economic and political models, says Sergei Markov, director
of the Moscow-based Institute of Politics.
</P>
<P>
   That group of voters, who retain some fondness for the pre-crash
policies of the Yeltsin government, is the Union's target. To reach
them, the faction has combined splinter parties established by
Nemtsov and Kiriyenko with a third faction set up by a liberal
parliament member, Irina Khakamada.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have an I.D.,'' Markov said. ``And now, when they've
decided to build one coalition, they have a very important message
for those people: One, we want to live as all people live in Europe
and the United States. And the second message is that we are
united. You don't have to waste your vote.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Union's leaders have visibly de-emphasized
the pro-Western half of their pro-Western, free-market philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Union's formation this summer, its leaders were
among Russian politicians who denounced NATO's air attacks on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais, who has been on a first-name basis with the West's
finance ministers for much of this decade, has regularly denounced
Western criticism of Russia's war in Chechnya as hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   And party leaders have embraced Prime Minister Vladimir Putin,
the man in charge of that war, as the sort of no-nonsense leader
Russia needs to restore its global image and shake up the domestic
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Masha Lipman, the deputy editor of the weekly newsmagazine Itogi
and a longtime political analyst, says the notion that Russia needs
to stand up to its enemies, internal and external, is an important
part of the faction's appeal. ``Chubais is clearly capitalizing on
this sentiment,'' she said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   It has not hurt the Union that the Kremlin and Putin have
returned the compliment. Putin, now the most popular man in Russian
politics, publicly praised the Union platform this week as a plan
that could be carried out in large part without much change.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has its own party of incumbency, Medved, which Putin
already has said he supports. But more than a few experts believe
Yeltsin and his government are working to boost the Union faction
as well, hoping to build a coalition in the parliament that can
break the grip on legislation that the communists and their allies
currently enjoy.

MARYANN KELLER: THE REDESIGN OF AN AUTO ANALYST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ Maryann N. Keller, long a powerhouse auto
analyst, has gone from critiquing companies to running a business _
one that wouldn't mind collaborating with the very auto companies
she used to kick around.
</P>
<P>
   A challenging adjustment? Not according to her. ``It has been
very easy for me to make this shift,'' said Ms. Keller, now
president of Priceline.com's auto unit here. ``I'm not selling
stock any more; I'm selling cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Priceline is the name-your-price Web site that allows customers
to bid online for plane tickets, hotel rooms and other items. This
year it expanded into cars, and that is where Ms. Keller comes in.
She knows the car business cold.
</P>
<P>
   She was the first woman to be an auto analyst _ and Detroit was
slow to accept her. Once early on, a General Motors executive
called her ``girlie.'' Such slights soon stopped. Institutional
Investor called her one of the top three auto analysts each year
from 1975 to 1993, working at ING Barings, Furman Selz and
PaineWebber. A couple of years, she was No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   From 1972 until June of this year, when she joined Priceline,
Ms. Keller loudly said what the auto industry didn't want to hear.
She was respected, if feared, by Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   But she tired of Wall Street, as she had in the mid-1980s, when
she managed money for three years. ``I look at this as an
opportunity for me to build a business and derive a lot of personal
fulfillment out of it,'' said Ms. Keller, who is 55.
</P>
<P>
   She met Jay S. Walker, the Priceline founder and vice chairman,
about a year ago, when she was delivering a speech on the auto
industry. He invited her to visit Priceline's offices. ``Why not?''
she thought. She was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, when she decided to leave Wall Street, she called
Priceline. ``Fifteen minutes later Jay called back,'' she said, and
she joined Priceline's management, now led by Richard S. Braddock,
the former Citicorp president.
</P>
<P>
   At Priceline, where 20-somethings bustle through the halls
wearing baseball caps and tennis shoes, she's one of a handful of
grown-ups. And one of the few grandparents: Ms. Keller, with three
grown children and four grandchildren, is married to Jay W. Chai,
chief executive of the American branch of a giant Japanese trading
company, Itochu International.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Perth Amboy, N.J., she majored in chemistry at
Rutgers and earned her MBA from the Bernard Baruch School of the
City University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Her new job at Priceline has clearly meant a new approach. Ask
how many cars Priceline has sold, and Ms. Keller won't say. ``I
can't tell you that, but I can tell you it is heartwarming,'' she
said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   A second plea is firmly refused. ``I used to be so frustrated
when people would say, `I can't tell you the numbers,''' Ms. Keller
said. ``I have to play the other side of the analyst's chair now.''
</P>
<P>
   Priceline began brokering auto sales this spring, and Ms. Keller
is busy with the nationwide expansion. At first, only customers in
the New York area could bid for cars. In the third quarter, it
expanded into California, Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania, with most of the rest of New England due to be added
by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline makes money as a broker; customers bid for vehicles
online and agree to pay the Web site $50 if they buy. Priceline
forwards the bids to nearby dealers, who pay it $200 if the lead
turns into a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Although Priceline is growing rapidly, it is still a
money-losing Internet start-up. In 21 months of operations,
Priceline has built a customer base of 2.9 million; the travel unit
is by far the company's largest.
</P>
<P>
   For the auto unit, some of Ms. Keller's old contacts have proved
helpful. Ford announced last month that it would direct some Web
site users who look up prices to try Priceline, where they can bid.
The link will be tested in Florida, then may be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow e-tailing hailed the move as evidence of
Priceline's appeal. ``Priceline's ability to partner with a
formidable supply partner such as Ford this early in the
development of its car-buying service points to the growing
demand,'' Lauren Cooks Levitan, an analyst at Robertson Stephens,
wrote recently. She called the agreement a ``win-win-win'' for
Priceline, car buyers and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Will Ms. Keller's contacts help her with other auto companies?
For about a decade, she was a bear on GM, the subject of her
scathing 1989 book, ``Rude Awakening'' (William Morrow).
</P>
<P>
   But the redesigned Maryann Keller remains hopeful. ``I don't
think the well is poisoned,'' she said. After all, she criticized
GM because of weak sales. ``I'm in a different place now,'' she
said, ``and I can help them sell cars.''

   FILM-CIDERHOUSE (Undated) _ In this adaptation of John Irving's
best-selling novel, ``The Cider House Rules,'' director Lasse
Hallstrom finds nobility with two abortionists and an incestuous
father. It's quite a feat, and quite a movie. Many will find the
subject matter disturbing (and worth more than a PG-13 rating), but
it's clearly one of the holiday season's richest and most daring
movie entries.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-STUART (Undated) _ It may not be the unqualified
crowd-pleaser that the already phenomenally successful ``Toy Story
2'' has turned out to be, but ``Stuart Little'' _ the second of the
holiday movie season's ``family'' affairs _ makes a more than
worthy companion piece.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-BICENTENNIAL (Undated) _ ``Bicentennial Man'' represents
one of Hollywood's rare excursions into the realm of ``classic''
science fiction. It's far from completely successful, and is sure
to disappoint much of its audience _ including sci-fi purists who
will object to Robin Williams' shtick. But it has an interesting
and rather outrageous premise, which it follows faithfully to a
logical end.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-ANNA (Undated) _ This latest _ and at 140 minutes, longest
_ version of ``Anna and the King'' definitely has its moments, and
looks so stunning that it works on the level of an historical epic.
In most other ways, however, it pales in comparison to its classic
predecessors, and also just generally feels like one too many trips
to the well.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-BREAKFAST (Undated) ``Breakfast of Champions,'' bankrolled
by and starring Bruce Willis, is a glorious, totally outrageous,
off-the-wall mess of a movie that's likely to confound, confuse and
irritate audiences like no film of the year. I personally enjoyed
its daring unpredictability and sheer abandon, though be warned I
seem to be in a distinct minority.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-RIDE (Undated) _ In ``Ride With the Devil,'' Ang Lee's
Civil War drama, he's mixed zen with a Larry McMurtry sensibility,
utilizing a cross-cultural troupe of characters with a cause. In
this case, men of the South are mobilized to form a guerrilla
warfare unit of Bushwhackers wreaking havoc on the invading Union
army and its sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-WARZONE (Undated) _ In ``The War Zone,''
actor-turned-director Tim Roth succeeds in bringing the horrific
truth of the impact of illicit incest on a family in a very real,
almost too real, way. And he's not just exploiting the act itself
but responsibly showing the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   TV-OLIVE (Undated) _ Parents looking for a gentle lesson in
doing the right thing, helping others and standing by one's friends
might check out Friday night's ``Olive, the Other Reindeer'' on
Fox. Most Christmas specials are easy to dismiss as seasonal fluff,
but good music, good writing and a good heart make ``Olive'' a good
bet to become a classic.
</P>
<P>
   By John Levesque. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   BKN-SONICS (Seattle) _ Seattle SuperSonics host the Portland
Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   By Ronald Tillery. (Story will move in the ``s'' category.)

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. (star) denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings
and running times are in parentheses.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER,'' starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa
Paredes, Antonia San Juan and Penelope Cruz. Directed by Pedro
Almodovar (R, 101 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   A whole new order of Almodovar extravaganza. The antic fizz and
theatrical exaggeration of this filmmaker's earlier work have
blossomed into a newly sophisticated style, one that is far more
wise and deeply felt. Lovingly dedicated to actresses who have
played actresses, this film weaves its own soap opera around ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'' and tells of splendidly resilient women;
Almodovar has aptly described his material as ``screwball drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich and entertaining, this story celebrates the power of
artifice and impersonation to transcend ordinary truth. The
irrepressible Ms. San Juan, a Spanish nightclub performer, plays a
transsexual named Agrado and is the film's biggest treat (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``BOYS DON'T CRY,'' starring Hilary Swank and Chloe
Sevigny. Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This stunning debut feature tells the strange and resonant story
of Brandon Teena, who despite being born Teena Brandon went on to
create a charismatic identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately
wrenching tale may sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into
Theodore Dreiser's idea of American tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The film makes it hauntingly real and even tenderly romantic,
with the astonishing acting needed to make it work. One of the
year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``THE CIDER HOUSE RULES,'' starring Tobey Maguire,
Charlize Theron and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Lasse Halstrom
(PG-13, 125 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Radically downsized in scope, and its examination of the issue
of abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with a
Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely
World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent raised in an
orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who performs
abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple (Ms.
Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but
smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a 40s
``David Copperfield'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``CRADLE WILL ROCK,'' starring Emily Watson, John Turturro,
Ruben Blades, John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Bill Murray and Vanessa
Redgrave. Written and directed by Tim Robbins (R, 132 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This huge Depression-era story features well-known figures from
Orson Welles to Nelson Rockefeller to Diego Rivera, and it works
them into an ambitious ``Ragtime''-like tableau. Though too many
figures in this landscape are reduced to naive caricature, Robbins
and his impressive cast bring strong passions to bear upon this
(mostly) true story of a legendary event: the trouble-fraught
production by Welles and John Houseman of the banner-waving 1936
agitprop musical ``The Cradle Will Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins and his cast play out all sides of this event with the
certitude that its importance lives on (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``THE END OF THE AFFAIR,'' starring Ralph Fiennes,
Julianne Moore, Stephen Rea and Ian Hart. Directed by Neil Jordan
(R, 105 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's intoxicating version of Graham Greene's 1951 novel, in
which an illicit affair becomes a far greater gamble than either
lover could have imagined. For this fearlessly eclectic filmmaker,
this is one more intelligent, brooding love story with a secret
twist.
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes and Ms. Moore breathe life into this story with a
dreamy, erotic intensity that in no way trivializes the film's
underlying ideas about religious faith. Period detail (the setting
is London in the mid-1940s) is sumptuously heightened by the
inspired costume designer Sandy Powell (``Shakespeare in Love'')
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``END OF DAYS,'' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Robin Tunney,
Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollak. Directed by Peter Hyams (R, 118
minutes). The star modestly tackles the role of a new savior who
may just keep mankind free of Satan for the next thousand years.
And that's not even the worst thing about this pointlessly nasty
would-be thriller.
</P>
<P>
   The material is so derivative that it amounts to a tag sale of
used parts from better apocalyptic films, with special credit owed
to ``The Exorcist'' for grisly sacrilegious tricks. Hyams favors a
jack-in-the-box approach to delivering shock value. The star
dutifully protects a nice young woman from demonic forces. But
Byrne plays the swaggering embodiment of pure evil and has the
better role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE GREEN MILE,'' starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan,
David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written
and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In adapting the death row drama that Stephen King wrote in
multiple installments, the director of ``The Shawshank Redemption''
could have managed more economy and fewer talky bits of business
around the cellblock. Still, this lengthy film is vivid and well
played.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth ensemble acting builds up to the discovery that a
gigantic condemned man (Duncan) is a prisoner with very special
abilities, which gives the film its mixture of religious overtones
and mild horror. Hanks, as a wry Southern prison guard, is so
unaffectedly good that it's redundant to say so (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``LIBERTY HEIGHTS,'' starring Adrien Brody, Joe Mantegna
and Ben Foster. Directed and written by Barry Levinson (R, 134
minutes). This semi-autobiographical comedy-drama remembering
teenage life, anti-Semitism and racism in mid-1950s Baltimore is
the fourth movie by Levinson to be set in his native city.
</P>
<P>
   A deeply felt nostalgia trip, the movie adroitly captures the
look and social attitudes of the city 45 years ago. But the
screenplay and performances are too muted for the movie to come to
terms with growing pains cushioned in the nostalgic haze (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``MANSFIELD PARK,'' starring Frances O'Connor and Jonny
Lee Miller. Written and directed by Patricia Rozema (PG-13, 105
minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Rozema's skillful screen adaptation of Jane Austen's
third novel, the protagonist Fanny Price (Ms. O'Connor) has been
sharpened into a proto-feminist heroine who triumphs over the
materialist, patriarchal values of her wealthy relatives through a
combination of wit, beauty and daring.
</P>
<P>
   Without bearing down too heavily, the screenplay (which
incorporates fragments of Austen's letters and diaries) equates
early 19th-century slave trading with the oppression of women. The
message is leavened with smart humor and warm three-dimensional
performances (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``MISS JULIE,'' starring Saffron Burrows and Peter Mullan.
Directed by Mike Figgis (R, 100 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Figgis, whose previous films ``Internal Affairs''
and ``The Loss of Sexual Innocence'' dwelled obsessively on the
darker aspects of sex, August Strindberg's late-19th-century drama
becomes a bleak study of the sexual disgust shared by a rebellious
aristocrat (Ms. Burrows) and the upwardly mobile footman (Mullan)
she taunts into having sex.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie's contemporary cinema-verite style is at odds with
the story and its setting. And Ms. Burrows' coldly haughty title
character is far less compelling than Mullan's earthy, cunning
footman (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``SLEEPY HOLLOW,'' starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci,
Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough
and Christopher Walken. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker and directed
by Tim Burton (R, 110 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This ornate visual fantasy, artfully concocted using a palette
that suggests nuclear winter, has little to do with Washington
Irving's story and everything to do with Burton's macabre vision.
</P>
<P>
   Depp makes a dashing hero as the film's shy detective, but the
story (by the writer of ``Seven'' and ``Fight Club'') is determined
to put the ick into Ichabod Crane.
</P>
<P>
   A first-rate cast and extraordinary technical talents are
attention-getting here, but so is the film's penchant for sardonic
beheadings. It's possible to admire Burton immensely for the secret
tenderness and rich imagination of his work without wanting to peer
at the exposed brain stems of his characters (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``SWEET AND LOWDOWN,'' starring Sean Penn, Samantha Morton and
Uma Thurman. Directed by Woody Allen (PG-13, 95 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In homage to the kind of jaunty 1930's jazz that has been heard
on many of his other films' soundtracks, Allen imagines a
consummate jazz character: Emmet Ray (played with gusto by Penn),
who can play the guitar as gorgeously as Django Reinhardt but lacks
certain interpersonal skills when it comes to his private life.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing attributes of various real musicians, the film turns
Emmet into another one of Allen's cad-geniuses and gives him a
long-suffering mute laundress as a sweetheart. (Ms. Morton works
miracles in her wordless role.)
</P>
<P>
   But on the storytelling level, the film remains flimsy. It's the
musical interludes, frequent and lovingly presented, that keep it
alive (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``TOY STORY 2,'' with the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim
Allen. Directed by John Lasseter; a Pixar Animated Studios film (G,
98 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   A wonderfully playful sequel, sustaining the first film's wit
and novelty while bringing new sophistication to computer-generated
animation. And here is welcome proof that Hollywood can still make
movies to please audiences of any age or persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   From its opening (a perfectly adorable ``Star Wars'' parody) to
its Capraesque conclusion, this is seamless work with more
metaphorical cleverness than that usually found in the toy bin.
Colorful new characters and more adventurous action enhance the
story of how Woody falls into the clutches of a sleazy toy dealer,
experiences newfound celebrity and needs to be rescued by his old
friends (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``TUMBLEWEEDS,'' starring Janet McTeer and Kimberly J.
Brown. Directed by Gavin O'Connor (PG-13, 100 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   An astoundingly vital performance by the British actress Janet
McTeer makes all, beautifully acted slice of contemporary
Americana a must-see film. Ms. McTeer is Mary Jo Walker, a sexy,
free-spirited woman with four marriages behind her who travels
across the country with her 12-year-old daughter, Ava (Ms. Brown).
</P>
<P>
   Like few other films, this one captures an intimately loving
(though not conflict-free) relationship between a parent and child
without becoming saccharine. The director plays Mary Jo's trucker
boyfriend, who is only the latest in a series of romantic disasters
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``THE WAR ZONE,'' starring Freddie Cunliffe, Ray
Winstone, Tilda Swinton and Lara Belmont. Directed by Tim Roth (not
rated, 99 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Roth is an actor known for roles in tough films, but never for
anything quite as raw as this. In this searing first feature, the
title battlefield is a rural English home where a teenage boy looks
upon his own family with helpless rage and astonishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the incestuous relationship between his father and older
sister, the film's wordless, baleful young hero struggles to come
to terms with this household horror. Understated but extremely
graphic at times, and shot with mournfully expressive simplicity by
Seamus McGarvey (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH,'' starring Pierce Brosnan, Sophie
Marceau, Dame Judi Dench, Robert Carlyle and Denise Richards.
Directed by Michael Apted (PG-13, 128 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This director is much admired for his ``Up'' series chronicling
the lives of former schoolchildren as they mature. And he has
managed to make James Bond grow up a little, too. Brosnan has grown
much more comfortable with the role of Bond, and most of the other
characters are also more interesting than might have been expected.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marceau slinks memorably through the role of a treacherous
oil heiress. Ms. Richards seemed a lot smarter playing high school
vixens than she does as a brilliant scientist here. The itinerary
roams from Scotland to Central Asia. And Apted handles the action
as well as he does the talk (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Film Series
</P>
<P>
   BOGART RETROSPECTIVE. He was a gangster. He was a private eye.
He skippered a fishing boat and ran a cafe in Casablanca. He was,
of course, Humphrey Bogart (1899-1957), the son of a Manhattan
surgeon and a magazine illustrator who achieved stardom in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the occasion of the centennial of his birth, he is the
subject of a retrospective in BAMcinematek, the Brooklyn Academy of
Music's Rose Cinemas' repertory program. This weekend offers two of
his best: Saturday, Raoul Walsh's ``They Drive by Night,'' about
two truckers framed for murder; and on Sunday, John Huston's
``Maltese Falcon,'' with Bogart as the private detective Sam Spade,
drawn into the intrigue surrounding a murder and a priceless
statuette.
</P>
<P>
   Each film is to be shown at 3, 6 and 9 p.m. Screening times are
subject to change. Admission to ``Bogie at BAM,'' through Jan. 30,
is $8.50 for adults and $5 for people over 62, children under 12
and students with valid identification. Information: (718) 623-2770
(Lawrence Van Gelder).

 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The painting of a black Madonna whose elephant dung
and pornographic touches have incurred the wrath of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and stirred a religious, cultural and political furor in
the city, was attacked at the Brooklyn Museum of Art Thursday by a
man who smeared paint on it but did no permanent damage, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Feigning illness to lull a security guard, the man, identified
as 72-year-old Dennis Heiner, of Manhattan, leaned against a wall,
darted behind a plexiglass shield, took out a plastic bottle and
squeezed white paint in a broad stroke across the face and body of
the Madonna, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   As the stunned guard and several museum visitors watched in
horror and shouted, ``Don't!'' and ``Stop!'' the man used his hands
to smear the paint over about a quarter of the surface of the
8-by-6-foot painting, ``The Holy Virgin Mary,'' by Chris Ofili, a
British artist of Nigerian descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He covered the head and face down to the shoulders and then
down to the breast line,'' said David Eigenberg, who witnessed the
incident at 2:33 p.m. in a small, fifth-floor gallery of the museum
on Eastern Parkway. He said he made a move to stop the man, but was
told by the guard to stay back.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, while the guard radioed for help, the man emerged
from behind the plexiglass, his paint-smeared hands shaking
nervously, but made no effort to get away. As other security
officials raced up, the guard, whose name was not disclosed, asked:
``Why did you do it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's blasphemous,'' the man replied quietly.
</P>
<P>
   James G. Kelly, the museum's security manager, said the guard
had not halted the attack because he had been surprised, and he
called the reaction correct under the circumstances. ``They're here
to truly observe and report,'' he said of the guards. ``If they can
come between someone in an act of aggression, they can stop it. But
they're not peace officers and have no arrest powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the police arrived, handcuffed Heiner and led
him away. He was charged with criminal mischief in the second
degree, a class D felony. A woman who said she was Heiner's wife,
Helena, said he was a devout Roman Catholic who believed the
painting, adorned with elephant dung on one breast and cutouts from
pornographic magazines, was sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The painting was offensive, he's absolutely right about
that,'' the woman said in a telephone interview. ``This painting is
your mother, the painting of the blessed mother, the mother of
Christ. So he said, `I will go there today and try to clean it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the attack, museum conservators removed the
painting and within an hour had cleaned it before the white paint
was dry, leaving the artwork apparently undamaged. ``It's like a
stain _ the sooner you get at it the better your chances of
removing it,'' said Sally Williams, a spokeswoman for the museum,
who noted that the painting would be back on display Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, in a statement, said that the trustees and staff
were ``shocked and extremely saddened by this incomprehensible
act.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ofili painting is part of an exhibit, ``Sensation: Young
British Artists from the Saatchi Collection,'' that has been one of
the most successful, and controversial, in the 177-year history of
the Brooklyn Museum. Charles Saatchi, the British advertising
magnate, owns the paintings and sculptures and is the show's
largest financial backer.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, a week before the exhibit's opening, Giuliani
led a chorus of protests by various groups, including the Catholic
league, objecting to the Ofili painting, a collage of paper, oil
paint, glitter and resin on linen. It depicts a black Madonna in
flowing blue robes, with a shellacked clump of dung on one breast
and cutouts of female genitalia from pornographic magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it ``sick stuff,'' repulsive and offensive to Roman
Catholicism, Giuliani denounced the museum for mounting the
exhibit, vowed to cut off its $7.2 million annual city subsidy,
then withheld the city's monthly subsidy payment and began
proceedings to evict the museum.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court battle ensued. The museum, backed by cultural
organizations, noted that Ofili often used elephant dung and other
unusual materials in his work as a cultural reference to his
African heritage, and contended that the mayor was violating the
free-speech rights of the artist and the museum in attempting to
suppress of exhibit. Judge Nina Gershon sided with the museum and
ordered the city to resume its subsidies and end its eviction
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Since the show's opening on Oct. 2, nearly 130,000 visitors have
flocked to see the ``Sensation'' show, making it the most
successful exhibit of contemporary art ever put on by the museum,
Ms. Williams said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because of the controversy surrounding the painting, the museum
had wanted to post 21 guards for the exhibition, which features
more than 90 items on the museum's fourth and fifth floors. But
requests by Saatchi, who put up $160,000, increased costs, and the
museum had to pare down the security staff to 10 guards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one museum official said, Saatchi had objected to a
piece of plexiglass that would have completely enclosed Ofili's
painting. Instead, a piece slightly larger than the painting was
hung from the ceiling, leaving gaps of several feet on either side
and a four-foot separation from the surface of the painting.
</P>
<P>
   Heiner, who the police said was arrested in 1990 on a charge of
obstructing government administration in a protest, bought his
$9.75 ticket to the exhibition at the museum entrance Thursday and
took an elevator to the fifth floor, where Ofili's painting is
hung, along with only one other item _ Ron Meuck's ``Mask'' _ in a
small, 12-foot-wide gallery between two larger rooms.
</P>
<P>
   After walking through several galleries, Heiner approached a
guard and said he was feeling dizzy and ill, said Kelly. The guard
advised him to sit down. He then approached the guard near the
Ofili painting and again said he was dizzy and ill.
</P>
<P>
   He was clad in a herringbone sport coat and dark trousers and
did not seem suspicious. ``He was very dapper,'' Kelly said. ``He
looked like a typical museum visitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Heiner then leaned up against the wall beside the painting, and,
choosing his moment, suddenly darted behind the plexiglass,
witnesses said.

GORE AND BUSH `DEBATE' EDUCATION AT A DISTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas stood on Gore's home turf on Thursday and sparred
over their education plans, acting for all the world as if they
were their party's nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who Thursday pledged a $115 billion federal commitment to
education that drew positive reviews from teachers unions, accused
Bush, a Republican, of wanting to drain money from public schools
to provide vouchers to students for private school.
</P>
<P>
   Bush accused Gore, a Democrat, of advocating a big-spending
liberal education program that invited the federal government to
intrude into local decision making. The problem with the Gore plan,
Bush said, is that it assumed that Washington was the source ``of
all wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither man has captured his party's nomination, but each held
his party's fundamental principles aloft Thursday in a preview of a
classic fall election matchup. Their messages, delivered hours
apart from the libraries of two Nashville schools on Thursday, were
noteworthy for the underlying assumption that each man would become
his party's standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
   And their broadsides were delivered at the same time that their
two maverick challengers _ former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey
on the Democratic side and Sen. John McCain of Arizona on the
Republican side _ sought to capture the hearts of independents by
making a joint appearance in New Hampshire on campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain and Bradley garnering much of the attention
Thursday, Gore and Bush both seemed eager to get on with their own
show.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was asked whether he wished he were involved in the session
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm involved in a debate here in Nashville,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush clearly relished the idea of engagement on Gore's home
court. He said he looked forward to debating Gore about education
because Gore was focused on ``bricks and mortar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president talks about buildings,'' Bush said
dismissively. ``I'm talking about children. The vice president
talks about bricks and mortars; I'm talking about hearts and souls.
I'll be glad to make that debate all day long across America.''
</P>
<P>
   The two also collected money at the same saloon here, the
Wildhorse, with Gore staging a fund-raiser Wednesday night and Bush
following Thursday night, in his first fund-raising foray into
Tennessee. Gore's wife, Tipper, introduced him by saying, ``He's
good enough, he's smart enough,'' an allusion to the idea that Bush
lacks the intellectual heft to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared with the state's top Republican officials,
including Gov. Don Sundquist, Sen. Bill Frist and former Gov. Lamar
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Gore drew more than $1.6 million, and Bush took in about
$750.000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore set the tone for the day by filling in the numbers of the
education plan he outlined in May. He said he would spend $115
billion over 10 years, $50 billion of it to provide universal
access to preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds. He would use federal
money to help increase teacher salaries, a novel proposal in a
presidential campaign, and to provide incentives to failing schools
to reverse course.
</P>
<P>
   The plan engendered much support from the teachers unions, which
have endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, president of the one-million member American
Federation of Teachers, liked the plan's comprehensive approach
toward recruiting teachers and retaining them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately we have to have higher teacher salaries along with
higher standards as we go forward because otherwise we aren't going
to be able to attract teachers into districts that have the
greatest needs,'' Ms. Feldman said in a telephone interview from
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association, the
largest union in the United States with 2.2 million teachers, also
hailed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole preschool program is particularly important,'' Chase
said in a telephone interview from Washington. ``All research shows
us those early years are vital to the ongoing success of the child,
and when you couple that with smaller class size, and standards for
students and teachers, tying that into questions of salary is
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   More skeptical was Abigail Thernstrom, a senior fellow at the
Manhattan Institute and a conservative education analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is not class size, it's that we don't have a
sufficient number of top college graduates going into teaching,''
Ms. Thernstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government doesn't have a track record of doing
this kind of thing well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had a similar response when asked his reaction to Gore's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the amount of money, which is fairly typical of
somebody who runs around the country saying I'm going to spend
money and solve your problems,'' Bush said. ``We have a fundamental
disagreement on the role of the central government. I believe the
role of the central government is to do a few things and do them
well. And when we have money left over, to pass it back to the
working people.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Bush would do with his proposal for a $483 billion
tax cut over five years, which Gore referred to Thursday as his
``risky tax scheme'' that would throw the nation back into deficits
and back into a recession.
</P>
<P>
   One big difference in the two candidates' education plans is how
they deal with failing schools. Bush would take back federal money
from nonperforming schools and give it to students to use as
vouchers toward private schools. Gore said he would require the
school districts to adopt an aggressive plan to turn around the
school and provide pay incentives for teachers in districts that
managed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that Bush's plan, in draining money from the public
schools, would give new meaning to the three R's: ``Reckless and
retrograde, reactionary, radical _ that's four R's. I sincerely
believe that it's an ideologically driven mistake,'' he said.

MILTON RUDIN, LAWYER FOR SINATRA AND OTHER STARS, DIES AT 79  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Mass., Israel)   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Milton A. Rudin, an entertainment lawyer who
represented celebrities from Marilyn Monroe to Liza Minnelli and
who for more than 30 years was Frank Sinatra's chief counsel,
defender, investment partner and friend, died Monday of pneumonia
at a rehabilitation center near his home in Beverly Hills. He was
79.
</P>
<P>
   In a career of more than 50 years, Rudin, who was known as
Mickey, stood in the thick of the Hollywood swirl. He was often
called on to answer questions about Sinatra's gambling interests
and the singer's acquaintances with underworld figures, and
repeatedly filed lawsuits over accounts in the news media that he
saw as unflattering, unfair or infuriating.
</P>
<P>
   As Marilyn Monroe's lawyer and the brother-in-law of her
analyst, Ralph Greenson, he was among the first on the scene when
the star died of a drug overdose in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Thickset and jowly, Rudin had cameo roles in four movies, twice
portraying a judge, leading his clients to give him the nickname
``The Judge.''
</P>
<P>
   His other clients included Lucille Ball and Desilu Studios, for
25 years; Warner Brothers, for 30 years; the moguls Marvin Davis,
Steve Ross and Stephen A. Wynn; plus Elizabeth Taylor, Norman Lear,
the Jackson Five and the Aga Khan. He represented Ms. Minnelli from
the beginning of her career until he effectively retired last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a one-of-a-kind good friend, great lawyer and also a
very funny guy in a kind of an ominous way,'' said the veteran
television producer and director George Schlatter, a friend for 35
years and a client for 15.
</P>
<P>
   Rudin, a New York City native, was a graduate of the University
of California at Los Angeles, and of Harvard Law School. He cut his
teeth in entertainment law here in the 1950s in the firm of Martin
Gang, a pioneer in the field, who became well known in the era of
Sen. Joseph McCarthy for helping arrange testimony before the House
Un-American Activities Committee by ``friendly'' entertainers
seeking to avoid the blacklist.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Rudin's association with Sinatra that brought him the
most prominence, as a public spokesman and private adviser,
responsible for some of the most delicate tasks.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Sinatra, Behind the Legend,'' J. Randy
Taraborrelli's 1997 biography, it was Rudin who handled Sinatra's
divorce from Mia Farrow, told the singer's disapproving mother,
Dolly, that Sinatra was marrying his fourth wife, Barbara Marx, and
informed Sinatra of the death of his second wife, Ava Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   Rudin also advised Sinatra on business matters, and the two once
joined in an unsuccessful bid to take over the Del E. Webb Corp.,
which owned several hotel-casinos in Nevada. In later years,
Rudin's focus shifted to libel and copyright actions defending the
star's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   A particular nemesis was the author Kitty Kelley, whom Rudin
twice sued unsuccessfully, first seeking to halt publication of
``My Way,'' her unauthorized 1986 biography of Sinatra. That suit
was eventually dropped, but Rudin later filed a libel suit accusing
Ms. Kelley of ruining his practice by thanking him as a source for
her 1991 biography of Nancy Reagan, which suggested an affair
between the first lady and Sinatra. In 1995, a federal appeals
court upheld dismissal of the suit, saying that Rudin could not
prove he had been harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Rudin also sued Barron's for defamation because it once referred
to him as Sinatra's mouthpiece, but a judge dismissed that suit,
too, ruling that ``the average Barron's reader'' would not consider
the term defamatory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, he and Sinatra ended their lawyer-client relationship
for reasons that were never made clear, but they remained friendly,
and Rudin attended the singer's funeral in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a divorce,'' said Lee Solters, a longtime
publicist for both men. ``More friendly afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudin was active in many philanthropic causes and had served as
a trustee of Reed College and as past regional board chairman of
the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mary Carol; a son, Michael, of Santa
Barbara; and two daughters, Pamela, of Irvine, and Lisa McGrady of
Reno, Nev.

BORED BY VODKA, RUSSIANS FIND MORE STYLE IN BEER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN VAROLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ To some Russians, it is nothing short
of heresy. Consumers, especially young people, are discovering
something they'd rather drink than vodka.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joy of beer is you can savor it for a long time and not
get drunk quickly, unlike vodka, which you must down in one shot,''
said one young businessman, as he finished a beer at a St.
Petersburg cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Vodka is still czar here, but consumption of beer is rising
sharply _ and the biggest Russian brewers, owned mainly by Western
European brewers, are investing heavily to step up production and
meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are drinking more beer now,'' said Viktor Tikhomirov, a
local artist and observer of popular culture. ``First, because it
is available, while in Soviet times it was hard to get. And second,
beer is now better made than before, when it was often sour and God
knows what substance collected at the bottom of your cup. Vodka is
more for holidays, birthdays and other festive occasions, and
getting warm on a cold day.''
</P>
<P>
   Russians drank almost 25 percent more beer in 1998 than in 1995,
according to Andrei Sterlin of Business Analytica, a Russian market
research firm. Consumption reached 910 million gallons, or 6.2
gallons per capita in 1998, Sterlin said, up from 730 million
gallons, or 5 gallons a person, in 1995. He expects output to reach
980 million gallons this year, with virtually all of it sold and
consumed domestically.
</P>
<P>
   The per-capita figures are still well below those in Western
Europe, where the average is 21 gallons of beer a year. ``There is
still a long way to go for the beer industry in Russia, and lot of
growth potential,'' said Hans Christian Jacobsen, director of the
agribusiness team at the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, which has invested $150 million in Russian breweries.
``The beer market is the last big underdeveloped market in Russia,
and it is potentially lucrative.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucrative, that is, for domestic brewers, whose costs are
counted mainly in rubles. The weakness of the Russian currency has
all but priced imports out of the market: at retail prices of 6 to
10 rubles (25 to 40 cents) for a half-liter bottle, more expensive
Western brands cannot hope to compete profitably for the mass
market.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, imports, which commanded 14 percent of the Russian
market as recently as 1995, have shrunk to 4.5 percent now,
according to Business Analytica. Heineken, once popular here, has
all but vanished from stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are especially aiming to win over those drinkers who used
to drink imported brands,'' said Andrei German, director of
marketing of Vena, the St. Petersburg brewery that makes Nevskoye,
a brand that has won international awards for quality.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to the trend than import substitution. Beer
has become a consumer rage, especially among younger and
better-educated Russians. Beer festivals in Moscow and St.
Petersburg last summer attracted crowds estimated in the millions.
</P>
<P>
   St. Petersburg is Russia's Milwaukee, its unofficial beer
capital. The city is home both to the industry leader, Baltika
Breweries, and to its first Western-style microbrewery restaurant,
Tinkov's, a fashionable spot popular with affluent young Russians
since it opened last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important tasks of the beer-making industry in
Russia is to get our citizens to change their habit for drinking
hard alcohol to drinking beer,'' said Timur Bolloyev, general
director of Baltika. To help create a ``culture of beer drinking,''
the company sponsors the St. Petersburg Beer Festival, now two
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, a shift to greater beer consumption here may be
welcome on health grounds. In a country that taxes vodka heavily,
25,000 Russians a year die of alcohol poisoning from impure bootleg
vodka; beer is too cheap to be worth bootlegging in any quantity.
</P>
<P>
   The growing demand for low-priced, high-quality beer has not
gone unnoticed by foreign investors. They have poured almost $700
million into the industry since 1990, half of it in the last two
years, and bought major stakes in the most important companies as
they were privatized.
</P>
<P>
   Vena, founded in 1872 by Austrian and German entrepreneurs, is
now two-thirds owned by the Finnish brewer Sinebrychoff, with the
remainder owned by the development bank. A joint venture of two
Scandinavian brewers, Pripps Ringnes and Hartwall, owns 70 percent
of Baltika, plus stakes in smaller breweries.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Interbrew was created by a merger of the Russian operations
of Interbrew, the Belgian company whose North American brands
include Labatt's and Rolling Rock, with Sun Brewing, founded in
Russia in 1993 by Indian entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   A fierce rivalry is developing between the two market leaders.
Sun Interbrew has been aggressively buying breweries in an effort
to vault its market share, now 14 percent, past that of Baltika and
its siblings, which together have 19 percent, according to Business
Analytica. And Efes of Turkey and South African Breweries have been
buying Russian breweries as well.
</P>
<P>
   Immediate profits are not the lure, since the same slide in the
ruble that priced imports out of the market also stretches the
payback period for these investments farther into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are optimistic that sector will grow in a volume basis, but
it is very hard to make decent money selling beer in Russia now,
because the current sale price has made it one of the cheapest
drinks on the market,'' said Jacobsen of the development bank.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the manufacturers want the volume now, even if profits
must come later. Vena is quadrupling its output to 32 million
gallons a year at a cost of $70 million. Baltika, which opened a
$50 million malt factory here last year in a joint venture with
Groupe Soufflet of France, has embarked on a $114 million capital
project to more than triple its beer output by 2002, partly
financed with a loan from the development bank.
</P>
<P>
   Bolloyev said Baltika wants to make 320 million gallons of beer
a year by 2002; it has started modest efforts to export its beer to
the West. Baltika's domestic sales are concentrated in St.
Petersburg and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Interbrew has tried a more dispersed strategy, expanding in
regional centers and buying two breweries in Ukraine. In Moscow, it
is in the final stages of buying the Klinsky Brewery, one of the
largest in the region, a deal that the company said would help it
match Baltika's planned size.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that beer is worth making'' in Russia,
said Shiv Vikram Kemka, a director of Sun Interbrew and a founder
of its predecessor, Sun Brewery. ``We're here for the long term,
and despite all volatility in the past few years, the business has
grown with varying degrees of profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is attractive because it is untapped,'' he added, ``and
you can build up a brand from scratch.''

while his brother Alexander, 9, is at the Pastor's right. Allison
Pilitsis, Taki and Alexander's mother, became a born-again

   (NYT4) BOSTON -- Dec. 16, 1999 -- BKN-RYAN-COLUMN-BOS -- Under
the basket in a recent game at the Fleet Center, the Boston
Celtics' Tony Battie sails over Utah Jazz center, Karl Malone. ``I
intend to keep playing this way my whole career,'' Malone says
about his all-out nature of play. ``And when I do retire, I'll know
I left it all out there, on the floor. I think I can do it, as long
as I keep preparing to play the way I know how.'' (Jim Davis/The

   (NYT3) NEW YORK -- Dec. 16, 1999 -- THEATER-NOTES -- The
independent film actress Parker Posey is headed for Broadway in the
spring. The twinkly gamine will make her New York theater debut in
``Taller Than a Dwarf,'' the Elaine May play that opens at the
Longacre Theater in April. ``I'm thankful,'' says Ms. Posey, 31,
who has been highly praised for her work in movies like ``Party
Girl'' and ``Dazed and Confused.'' ``It's pretty hard to get plays
unless you're well known.'' (Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times)

   (NYT1) UNDATED - Dec. 16, 1999 -- MET-DESIGN-EXHIBIT --
``Washstand'' 1904 by Charles Rennie Mackintosh (Scottish,
1868-1928). Oak, ceramic tile, leaded colored glass, and mirror
glass. At right, ``Armchair'' by Francis Jourdain (French,
1876-1958). Mahogany; split cane. Proving once again that it can
mount a boutique of a show with the same panache as a five-alarm
blockbuster, the Metropolitan Museum has unveiled an exquisite
sampling of 20th-century design objects from its own collection. A
salute rather than a full survey, ``A Century of Design, Part I:
1900-1925'' is installed in several intimate galleries in the
20th-century wing. (Metropolitan Museum of Art/The New York Times)

   TRUMP-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ Donald Trump builds buildings. I
write about them. So far, he hasn't given me an occasion to write
glowingly about his architectural projects. It would be great if
this changed. I'm not hopeful. But I love the color,
contentiousness and comedy Trump brings to the contemporary urban
scene. Adrian Stokes, the British art critic, once wrote that
``Architecture is limited to forms without events.'' I disagree. As
a social, public and urban art form, architecture can't be
separated from the events that buildings contain, shape and
provoke. Architecture criticism, in written appraisals or the
comments of sidewalk superintendents, qualifies as an event in this
sense. Even when criticism is negative, it is part of the fabric
that holds a great city together. I don't hate Trump's buildings,
but even if that were the case, I would still see them as a
challenge to examine my preferences in relation to his. By Herbert
Muschamp. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   MUSIC-LANGUAGE (subslug) (Undated) _ A musical observer a
century ago could have looked around at a number of living
composers whose works were being regularly performed wherever
Western classical music was known. And most of those composers were
relatively young. We live in a different world. Most of the
composers who are widely admired today are over 50, and some are
over 90. Once John Cage had produced his silent piece ``4' 33'',''
in 1952, there was perhaps nowhere to go but sideways. The only
progress made after that was in electronic music and in the
recovery of large form, whether by erstwhile Serialists, such as
Pierre Boulez, or by the new Minimalists, such as Steve Reich. And
even in these areas, not much has changed in the last 20 years. By
Paul Griffiths. (Moved).

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DOCUMENTARY-FILMS (Berkeley, Calif.) _ The Fantasy building has
been the birthplace of cinematic flights of fancy _ to the Sahara,
to the concert halls of 18th-century Vienna, to the Amazon jungle.
But this seven-story glass and concrete structure, also houses a
different breed of filmmaker. For more than a decade, the film
producer, Saul Zaentz has offered low-cost space to local
documentarians, making his building a center for San Francisco's
growing, well-regarded documentary community. By Edward Wong.

</P>
<P>
   SNOW-ON-CEDARS-FILM (Hollywood) _ ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' is
a complex story that spreads across many years and while it is, at
heart, a love story, it also contains elements of epic historical
importance, like the incarceration of Japanese-Americans in
detention camps during World War II. And there are three main plot
threads, according to Scott Hicks, the film's director. A murder
mystery (the Japanese-American fisherman is accused of murdering a
white fisherman, with whose family he had been embroiled in a
soured land deal), a love story (between Ishmael, a war veteran and
editor of the island's newspaper, and the accused fisherman's wife)
and the story of how the war had affected each of them and their
community. The film opens Wednesday. By Rick Lyman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SHOAH-VIDEO (Undated) _ Time doesn't fly in Claude Lanzmann's
monumental film; it melts. A chronicle of the Holocaust, ``Shoah''
(``annihilation'' in Hebrew) proceeds deliberately, inexorably, for
9 hours and 23 minutes, set always to the click-clack of boxcars
that carried Jews to the gas chambers and crematoriums. Released in
theaters in 1985 and now back on video after seven years out of
distribution, the documentary focuses primarily on the death camps
in the Polish towns of Treblinka and Auschwitz. By Peter M.
Nichols. (Moved).

   HAMLET-THEATER (New York) _ What may be the very last new
``Hamlet'' of Shakespeare's millennium opens at the Joseph Papp
Public Theater Sunday night _ boards that many melancholy Danes
have trod before. This time, Liev Schreiber wears the customary
suits of solemn black, under the direction of the Romanian-born
Andrei Serban. By Matthew Gurewitsch. (Moved). Photo.

   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PARSONS-DANCE (New York) _ As the choreographer for ``Times
Square 2000,'' Manhattan's round-the-clock salute to the
millennium, David Parsons is putting the finishing touches on
nearly a dozen new dances by the end of the month. Colleagues say
he has kept his part of the program on track _ despite a trip to
the hospital to be treated for dehydration _ with shrewd planning,
a lively imagination and undisguised pragmatism. The outdoor
celebration will start around sunrise on Dec. 31 and continue for
24 hours. By Christopher Reardon. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   LE-CORSAIRE-DANCE (Undated) _ The ``Dance in America'' broadcast
of American Ballet Theater in ``Le Corsaire,'' which Channel 13
will broadcast Monday night at 9 in New York, finds the dancers in
splendid form when they are allowed to do what they do best _
dance. They're less successful when required to do what's
increasingly demanded on television today _ talk, talk, talk. By
Harris Green. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RADIO-CITY-CHRISTMAS (New York) _ Once my critical colleagues
have dispatched themselves to various ceremonies of carols, the
``Messiah'' of the day or the latest ``Christmas Oratorio,'' I
check to see that no one is looking and make a beeline for Radio
City Music Hall. I like the ``Radio City Christmas Spectacular''
because it tells me how the season is progressing. I like a Santa
not afraid to loosen his hips to a boogie beat. The Rockettes make
my heart beat fast. There is in this year's show a dance sequence
of multiplying Santas: so many that by the end they barely fit
onstage. It's comforting to know that there will be enough Kriss
Kringles available for every borough and congressional district in
New York City, with some left over for the immediate suburbs. By
Bernard Holland. (Moved).

<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRY-MUSIC (Undated) _ Country music almost by definition
exists in a convoluted, almost duplicitous relationship with its
past. Inherently reactionary _ that's the whole point _ country on
the surface is all about roots, constancy, shared references both
in terms of the music and the lyrics. But, from its beginnings as a
commercial force country has always been an intensely marketed
amalagm of old and new, real and contrived that was willed into
existence in the 1920s by the modernizing influences of radio, new
recording technology and urbanism. By Peter Applebome. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ART-DECO-ANTIQUES (New York) _ As stocks soared this year, the
New York market for antiques, collectibles and 20th century objects
eclipsed even the levels reached in the boom years of the 1980s.
Auctions, fairs and exhibitions at museums and galleries attracted
new collectors and dealers as well as a new art fair to Manhattan,
heightening the awareness of the decorative arts, especially in the
Art Deco style. By Rita Reif. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   AIRPORT-ARCHITECT (Paris) _ Having designed 30 airport terminals
around the world, Paul Andreu can hardly escape being known as an
airport architect. Not that there is anything amiss with that.
Airports today are what railroad stations were at the turn of the
century, gateways that every year provide tens of millions of
travelers with their first and last impressions of a city. And if
Andreu keeps being invited to build airports, it is because this
engineer-turned-architect enjoys a worldwide reputation for
designing visually striking and passenger-friendly terminals. By
Alan Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TOMASELLI-ART (New York) _ The painter, Fred Tomaselli, uses
cutout photos of birds, flowers, insects and pictures of lips and
eyeballs clipped from fashion magazines as materials for his
collages, which are sealed in several coats of resin. Pictorially
the work veers between the figurative and the abstract, but the
result is usually the same: eye-popping imagery that is dense,
decorative and witty. The latest and largest example, ``Gravity's
Rainbow (Large),'' is now on view at the Whitney Museum of Art at
Philip Morris on 42nd Street through Jan. 7. By William Harris.
(Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-AMERICAN-DAUGHTER (Los Angeles) _ The scene is a brunch in an
elegant living room in Georgetown, the upper-class Washington
enclave. Christine Lahti and a half-dozen actresses and actors are
filming ``An American Daughter'' in a home in the upscale Hancock
Park section of Los Angeles. Washington _ the town's hypocrisies,
its self-important journalists and snarky politics _ serves not
only as the setting for the Wendy Wasserstein
comedy-drama-turned-television-movie but the catalyst for the
unique personal and professional pitfalls that face women in and
around government. The drama, which explores the corrosive effects
of a private life turned public before the television cameras, is
now completing production in Los Angeles, and is set to be shown
next spring over Lifetime. By Bernard Weinraub. (Moved).

   (NYT33) UNDATED - Dec. 16, 1999 -- NY-DIALLO-TRIAL - The cover
of the March 8, 1999 New Yorker Magazine. Citing a ``tidal wave of
pretrial publicity'', an appellate court ruled on Thursday that the
trial of four officers accused of killing Amadou Diallo last
February should be held in Albany County. The change of venue order
by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court was an extraordinary
remedy that is reserved for the rarest of cases. But it said that
the shooting of Diallo is that rare case. (The New York Times)

COSMETICS-2-COX -- Dorscheiia Jackson models the Versace makeup

professional makeup artist looks for in a cosmetic. Great for
people who want a polished look with a rich color and lightweight
texture, but might be a bit pricey for someone who doesn't wear
makeup often. (William Berry/Cox News Service)

   (NYT30) UNDATED -- Dec. 16, 1999 -- ADV. FOR SUN., DEC. 19 --
COSMETICS-1-COX -- Jessica Hanna models the Sonia Kashuk makeup
line made exclusively for Target. The line offers good quality for

which is defined by them as a system where policy decisions of

Rodney Graham turns his camera upside down to give a new
perspective of trees at the Dia Center. Dia's efforts have a
distinct intellectual slant that can sometimes feel slightly
medicinal. It is possible to emerge from a Dia show feeling that
good deeds have been done: by Dia, for organizing it, and by
oneself, for seeing it. (Dia Center for the Arts/The New York

   (NYT25) NEW YORK -- Dec. 16, 1999 -- DIA-ARTS-CENTER-1-B&AMP;W --
Douglas Gordon uses double images from ``Hypnosis,'' a little-known
Otto Preminger film, in his current work at the Dia Center. Film,
video and photography, the current juggernauts of contemporary art,
have never been dominant at Dia, so it seems noteworthy that four
of the seven artists it is showing this fall are involved with at
least one of these media. (Dia Center for the Arts/The New York

title of the show now at the Palace: Liza Minnelli's irresistible
tribute to her father, Vincente, who, beginning with ``Cabin in the
Sky'' in 1943, directed some of MGM's greatest musicals. Ms.
Minnelli may be somewhat rounder than when she won her Oscar for

Some have singled out Trump as a supreme example of Bad Taste,

LAND ROVER DISCOVERY SERIES II: OFF-ROAD APPLICATIONS FOR MOBILE
COMPUTING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LABELLE, Quebec _ A camel is said to be excellent for traveling
through the desert, but you'd never guess as much if you took it on
a test drive through New York. Though it comes with standard
leather and can be fitted with Asian carpets, the thing lurches,
belches and is hard to park, and the fact that it goes a long way
on a gallon of water is neither here nor there.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with sport utility vehicles. Most are bought these days
as ersatz minivans, and are therefore rated on how carlike they
ride, how much stuff you can pack in, how many cupholders, how
teeth-rattling the stereo.
</P>
<P>
   True, many have made stunning strides in coddling passengers,
slathering the interior with supple hides, filtering out the moan
of those big tires, taming the ride. But the fact remains that SUVs
are beasts best appreciated in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Ergo, after a white Land Rover Discovery Series II test car
arrived in Manhattan, off we drove to the great north woods, aka
the Papineau-Labelle Provincial Park in the Laurentian Mountains of
Quebec. A large and lovely stretch of hilly wilderness rich in deep
lakes, wildlife and mosquitoes, Palineau-Labelle goes farther off
the beaten path each year as its trails succumb to benign neglect.
</P>
<P>
   I like to go fishing there, and used to do so in whatever old
car I had, most memorably an '81 Honda Civic wagon. The previous
summer we cracked the oil pan of a (rented) Nissan Altima; last
summer, the park banned low-slung sedans and urged visitors to use
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   This is entry-level off-roading, requiring a few inches of extra
clearance and some basic smarts about fallen branches, washed-out
roads and scampering bear cubs. On the latter: as soon as I saw the
cubs, I stopped and cut the engine. After a few moments, my
partner, abruptly recalling legends of how fiercely maternal bears
feel toward their progeny, whispered, ``Can you raise the windows
with the engine off?''
</P>
<P>
   This is where sport utilities come into their own _ and where
the Disco's proud pedigree starts to show. The silhouette of a
jerrycan on wheels, for example, begins to make sense when you go
airborne over an unexpected heave in the road.
</P>
<P>
   Front-seat passengers return to their seats with L.L. Bean caps
intact, while those in the rear are rewarded with brief glimpses of
the trees through windows thoughtfully punched into the high roof.
Sunroofs front and aft expand the possibilities of free flight even
further, and during one particularly dramatic launch I fantasized
about being catapulted into the great outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   The Disco not only takes punishment, it seems to enjoy it (which
is something you wouldn't say about a camel, even in the desert).
We took it up abandoned logging trails, weaving around boulders and
logs; we took it on a road drowned under a breached beaver dam; we
took it up vertical hills and through raspberry patches; we raced a
Jeep Grand Cherokee around an old quarry, tying to see which would
get stuck first. (Neither did.)
</P>
<P>
   The thing bobs, weaves, digs in and keeps going. This is what
driving an SUV should be all about: fun.
</P>
<P>
   Face it, a rumpled baby boomer in search of fine bass is
unlikely to do anything that requires extraordinary skill or poses
serious danger, and most SUVs can handle the backwoods. But I'm not
sure that throwing a Lincoln Navigator or Cadillac Escalade around
the woods qualifies as ``fun.'' They're too big, too plush, too
suburban.
</P>
<P>
   For fun you need attitude, and Land Rover has a heritage it
nurtures even in the literature with the car. In the owner's
manual, instructions for fording streams include a haughty warning
that the CD changer under the seat might get soaked.
</P>
<P>
   Attitude is good. But if I was looking to plop down
$34,000-plus, and I was not planning to spend the rest of my life
in Papineau-Labelle Park, I'd make sure that the attitude was
tempered by serious creature comforts _ if only because every other
vehicle in this price range has them. That, in effect, is the
challenge Land Rover faced with the Series II Discovery _ a
challenge created by its own Range Rover stablemates, which
effectively pioneered the upscale sport utility and still wallow
comfortably in the $60,000-plus class.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The problem with updating the Disco was that so much of its
charm lay in the very anomalies that made it clumsy on the highway.
Its signature silhouette comes from the greatest height (76.4
inches without roof rails) and shortest wheelbase (100 inches) of
any mainstream sport utility, but these attributes also cause the
truck to sway to every crosswind and induce carsickness in children
and other domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
   Land Rover says the Series II is very different from Disco I _
that it is 6 inches longer, 3.5 inches wider, has a broader stance
and 13,500 new parts. It certainly has all the mainstream luxury
cues, like 10-way power seats, speakers everywhere, six cup holders
and the aforementioned dual power sunroofs.
</P>
<P>
   But the equipment that makes the biggest difference is an option
called Active Cornering Enhancement. It senses when the body starts
to tilt during cornering and automatically pumps special sway bars.
The effect is to keep this box tall and upright through normal
cornering.
</P>
<P>
   Lest the driver get carried away, body lean is progressively
returned at higher speeds. Though I did not have a Disco without
ACE to compare, I've driven enough sport utilities to appreciate
the relative absence of sway.
</P>
<P>
   We also had fun with another feature: Hill Descent Control,
which is activated by a button on the dash. Shift into low range,
point the Disco down a muddy hill, push the button and let go. A
computer manipulates the brakes to keep the Disco crawling down at
3.5 to 7.5 miles an hour, or faster if you apply the gas.
</P>
<P>
   We played with this and the equally sophisticated four-wheel
electronic traction control in the sand pits, using them on
progressively steeper and sandier hills, and the Disco kept clawing
away, up or down, like a determined ant.
</P>
<P>
   There are who think this is almost too much, that something in
off-roading is lost when computers take over. That may be true on
the odd stint into the woods, when working the pedals is part of
the fun, but if I had to traverse the Gobi Desert for a living, I
wouldn't mind sharing the chores.
</P>
<P>
   My main complaint was with its reluctant power. The Disco uses a
vintage 4-liter, aluminum, pushrod V8 _ designed by Buick in the
early 1960s _ that produces 188 horsepower and 250 foot-pounds of
torque at 2,600 rpm. It is undoubtedly capable of towing the 5,500
pounds the vehicle is rated for, certainly ample for cruising the
turnpike at 80, where legal, and awfully good at slurping fossil
fuel. But it does nothing to dispel the feeling that this is a
heavy vehicle _ at more than 4,800 pounds, it is _ pushing a wall
of air, a feeling enhanced by the accelerator's long travel. My
Cherokee Sport with its in-line 6 feels perkier, not to mention a
Grand Cherokee with a 4.7-liter V8.
</P>
<P>
   But power is not the name of this game. Image is, and
competence, and you're not likely to get more of either in anything
short of a Hummer _ or a camel.  &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The thrill of shopping online is that it replaces the shopping
cart with a vehicle that has the power and responsiveness of a
fighter plane. Shoppers can rapidly scan the horizon for available
products, dive to examine individual items, and then track them
with radar-like precision as they are shipped from a warehouse to
their front doors.
</P>
<P>
   But more and more this holiday season, Internet users are
finding that the sophisticated online shopping machinery can
malfunction under actual field conditions.
</P>
<P>
   When it does, some shoppers experience a particularly
aggravating form of helplessness: Companies that have spent tens of
millions of dollars on advertising to attract shoppers often become
distressingly mute when customers complain.
</P>
<P>
   Online stores face all the pitfalls of any Internet service _
sites that can be slow and hard to use and crash at the moment
people want to use them most. They are subject to all the flaws of
any mail-order company _ shipments that may have the wrong items or
damaged goods, or arrive late, or are inexplicably lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say mistakes never will happen is unrealistic, especially
given the scale of what is happening in this industry,'' said John
Barbour, the chief executive of Toysrus.com. That site was nearly
crushed by a tenfold increase in visitors in November that was
prompted by a sale promoted in 62 million catalogs mailed by its
parent, Toys ``R '' Us.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a bricks-and-mortar business where things grow 5
percent a year,'' Barbour said. ``We are tripling and quadrupling
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties of online retailers reflect, in large part,
their very success. Traffic at online stores is up 45 percent this
month from last December, according to Media Metrix, a New York
research firm. Analysts expect online sales to triple from last
year, the first big holiday season on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   What is exasperating for many customers is the way some online
stores are dealing with the inevitable problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk away feeling this is so ducky that I didn't leave my
house and got all my shopping done at 10 o'clock at night,'' said
Terri Ann Sullivan of Manhattan Beach, Calif., who bought her twin
daughters two hot Nintendo Game Boy units as well as electronic
cameras and printers available on Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the box arrives, and there is only one stupid Game Boy,
without all the pieces you need, and you say this is no good,'' Ms.
Sullivan said. When she logged back on to Amazon, the site would
say only that her other Game Boy had been delayed, along with the
cameras and printers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just freaked,'' she said. ``They didn't contact me to say
it's possible you won't ever get these. And they never said they
were sorry.'' Ms. Sullivan eventually canceled the order and found
some items in a local Best Buy store and others on Etoys.com.
</P>
<P>
   More people receive their orders as promised than have
experiences like this, of course. But BizRate, a company that
surveys 30,000 online shoppers each day, is finding that customer
satisfaction, especially with the speed of delivery, is falling.
</P>
<P>
   Customers' rating of on-time delivery, on a 10-point scale, fell
from 8.16 in October and the first half of November to 7.91 in the
three weeks ended Dec. 5. Overall satisfaction was down by a
similar amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much buzz about the ease of shopping online that
expectations are going up,'' said Farhad Mohit, the chairman of
BizRate. ``If thing's don't go flawlessly, it's much more likely
for Web sites to disappoint people.''
</P>
<P>
   The current timeliness rating of 7.91 is well below the 8.11
that BizRate measured for the corresponding period last year. As
the online stores became swamped at the end of the holiday season
last year, BizRate's score fell to 7.39 by the end of December
1998, from 8.17 at the end of November.
</P>
<P>
   One area in which BizRate finds online customers more satisfied
this year is pricing, reflecting the big discounts some sites are
offering as they put growth above profits.
</P>

   ``I have never seen such crazy deals on the Net as there are
now,'' said Jack Yedvobnick, a book salesman in Mahomet, Ill., who
says he scours the Web for bargains using sites like Cybergold.com
and Coolsavings.com that offer the online equivalent of coupons.
Mercata.com, he boasts, offered him $50 off on a $100 video
recorder. So far, he has received all the items he ordered,
although he concedes that many sites with the lowest prices are
hard to use.
</P>
<P>
   This year, online stores are hoping that they can prevent the
sort of meltdowns that occurred a year ago. Fingerhut, the
mail-order unit of Federated Stores that handles the shipping for
Etoys and Wal-Mart.com, has ordered all its employees, from its
chief executive down, to help out in its warehouse, a tactic used
by Amazon last year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Toysrus.com declared this week that it would no
longer promise to deliver new orders in time for Christmas so it
could devote its attention to a backlog of existing orders.
</P>
<P>
   That is of no help for Nancy Olson, who ordered a video game
from Toysrus.com at the end of November for her nephew's birthday
on Dec. 8. The Web site assured her that the item was in stock and
would be delivered before her deadline. But after a week of
waiting, two unanswered e-mails and 10 minutes on hold on the
telephone, Ms. Olson was told by a phone representative that the
game would not be available until Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think four weeks is a bit much for an order,'' said Ms.
Olson, who runs a small graphics business in Chatham, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of mistake should not have happened, because the Toys
``R'' Us computer is programmed to remove any product from the Web
site as soon as the last item in the warehouse is sold. But when it
comes to keeping track of hundreds of thousands of objects, the
system is not perfect. ``If somebody picks the wrong product and
puts it in a box, suddenly your inventory goes out of kilter,''
Barbour, the chief executive, said.
</P>
<P>
   Web store operators say that keeping up with questions from
customers is like the sorcerer's apprentice trying to keep back the
flood with a bucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do the orders go up dramatically over holidays; calls
and e-mail go up even faster,'' said David Lord, the chief
executive of Toysmart.com, which this week was trying to work
through a backlog of 1,500 e-mails. ``Whether we like it or not,
customers don't trust the Web. So they will place an order now and
call us 10 minutes later to say `Are you sure you will get the
order out?'''
</P>
<P>
   Research analysts for FAC/Equities, a brokerage firm, tested the
customer service capacity of 89 top online retailers, sending an
e-mail question to them. About half answered within a day, a
quarter took two to six days to respond, and a quarter did not
reply.

   Often, even if an e-mail or a phone call is answered, the
response leaves aggrieved shoppers cold.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Sansone, an executive with a liquor wholesale firm in
Lebanon Township, N.J., said he was shocked that an Amazing Ally
doll from Amazon.com was delivered in its original manufacturer's
box, allowing anyone to see what he had ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two young daughters who still believe in Santa,'' he
said, ``and I don't want to compromise this.'' Sansone called
Amazon to complain and was told that the company's policy is to
ship certain large items in their manufacturers' boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong answer,'' he wrote in a followup e-mail to Jeff Bezos,
Amazon's chief executive. That note prompted a response from an
Amazon executive who said the policy would be changed. An
Amazon.com spokesman said such large toys are now wrapped in paper
before they are shipped.
</P>
<P>
   As for the problems with out-of-stock items that Ms. Sullivan
had, the Amazon spokesman said the company was largely shipping
products as advertised but had run into delays, especially with
some popular products.
</P>
<P>
   Some complaints about Internet shopping have been more
psychological. Michael Melcher, for example, a New York lawyer,
said he had received all his online orders as promised but still
was not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much as I enjoyed avoiding surly clerks and pushy shoppers, I
felt unexpectedly empty after purchasing gifts for six nieces and
nephews,'' he said. ``I missed the physical exploration of
shopping. Ordering online was faster, but it felt like work.''

LAUTENBERG TO ENDORSE GORE

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ In an effort to embarrass Bill Bradley here
in the first-in-the-nation primary state, Vice President Al Gore's
campaign will announce Friday that New Jersey Senator Frank
Lautenberg is endorsing Gore for president.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg will also attend Friday's Democratic town hall forum
at Daniel Webster College in Nashua, in a show of support for the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   During a telephone interview Thursday, Lautenberg said he had
had ``much more contact'' with Gore over the years than with
Bradley, a former New Jersey senator who served with Lautenberg. He
said he had committed to support Gore well before Bradley ever told
him he would be getting into the race.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what decision he would have made if he had known
Bradley was going to run, Lautenberg said, ``All things being as
they are, I would choose Al Gore again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg praised Gore for his work on the environment and
education, and said his experience in the Senate and the vice
presidency made him most qualified to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to embarrass Bill Bradley,'' Lautenberg said.
``Should things go against my candidate and Bill Bradley's the
nominee, I think I could very comfortably support Bill Bradley.''

IT'S BETTER TV WHEN THE DANCE DOES THE TALKING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Harris Green, a former editor editor at Dance magazine, writes
about the performing arts.  
 By HARRIS GREEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Dance in America'' broadcast of American Ballet Theater in
``Le Corsaire,'' which Channel 13 will broadcast Monday night at 9
in New York, finds the dancers in splendid form when they are
allowed to do what they do best _ dance. They're less successful
when required to do what's increasingly demanded on television
today _ talk, talk, talk.
</P>
<P>
   It's another example of the medium's forgetting that actions not
only speak louder than words but also make livelier viewing.
</P>
<P>
   The company, taped live last February at the Orange County
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, Calif., is certainly at its
best in this Byronic romp, in which pirates, slaves and a jolly
pasha dance in harems and grottoes and on storm-tossed ships.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally the director Matthew Diamond and the editor Girish
Bhargava will jerk the viewer from a good center seat downstairs to
a perch in the top balcony to savor a floor pattern (even though
the corps may look like a flea circus performing it).
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, they avoid the hazards inherent in televised
ballet by using a minimum of close-ups to concentrate on steps and
phrases, line and mass. Although far from a great ballet,
``Corsaire'' emerges as great fun.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the producer, Channel 13, has added some
contrived showmanship. Kevin McKenzie, Ballet Theater's artistic
director, introduces the program, gracefully speaking a jaunty text
by Wendy Wasserstein about the difficulty of summarizing the
ballet's plot.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the plot of ``Corsaire'' is not complex; it's merely
overpopulated. There are two villains and two ballerinas, plus a
Pirate Woman who struts on whenever a partner is needed by the
leader of those impromptu ensembles that may come merrily, merrily
from out of nowhere. A brief synopsis would have oriented the most
innocent of viewers within seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, considerable time is spent having the dancers describe
what their characters will do in the coming act. Nothing could have
been better devised to befuddle the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Stiefel at least gives a charmingly casual account of his
derring-do as Conrad, the lead corsaire. Vladimir Malakhov,
however, discusses his role of the slave trader, Lankendem, in a
heavy Russian accent that is difficult to follow. Angel Corella,
caught in close-up on a bad-hair day, is only a bit more
intelligible about his part, Ali, the slave boy. ( Corella's
sensational dancing in Act II will bring down the house.)
</P>
<P>
   Julie Kent as the heroine, Medora, actually forgets what comes
next at one point, but this lapse is occasioned more by the
nebulousness of the plot than by its intricacy. The case for
complexity is hardly proved when some unfortunate child is cornered
at intermission for a pop quiz on Act I. (He flunks.)
</P>
<P>
   Viewed during this festive season and consumed along with cups
of sufficiently potent eggnog, such genial gimmickery would seem
harmless enough if Ballet Theater and PBS hadn't collaborated on
what was presented as a special performance, with Natalia Makarova
as host, two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   The show was actually assembled from two performances taped
before an audience invited to provide ``live'' reactions. Now,
anything that gets more ballet on television is welcome, but what's
unsettling about this ruse was how time that could have been
devoted to dance was given over to several vapid interviews with
the dancers.
</P>
<P>
   This fascination with chitchat over performance had already
reached epidemic proportions on telecasts of the Olympics. The
world's top athletes competing among themselves was apparently
considered such a poor ratings draw by NBC that its coverage of the
1996 Atlanta games completely ignored some sports to make room for
mini-biographies (usually of Americans and often of eventual
losers) and the deeper thoughts of John Tesh. Wasn't PBS created to
avoid programming by polls and focus groups?
</P>
<P>
   PBS was also reluctant to let well enough alone when presenting
some works of Paul Taylor. ``Company B,'' danced to the galvanizing
recordings of the Andrews Sisters, was utterly deconstructed when
Diamond, Bhargava and the producer Judy Kinberg set it in a
realistic dance hall as part of a program aptly titled ``The
Wrecker's Ball.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Taylor drew a picture of American innocence on the eve of World
War II in ``Company B'' and regularly undercut its high spirits
with dark portents of the looming conflict. In the abstract space
of an empty stage, a man crumpling to the floor during ``Bei mir
bist du schon'' is deeply moving.
</P>
<P>
   In PBS's concrete setting of a real ballroom, he's just another
drunk. ( Taylor is said to have loved the result, I should add.)
</P>
<P>
   If the best of Fred Astaire's classic RKO film routines haven't
demonstrated it, the movie ``George Balanchine's The Nutcracker,''
also edited by Bhargava, inadvertently showed how filmed dance
makes its strongest impact simply by occurring right before your
eyes. Bhargava's inventive cutting of the Act I children's party
and the battle with the mice made these ``Nutcracker'' scenes
unusually exciting. (Has anyone pointed out that the designer
Rouben Ter-Arutunian's mice are caricatures of Balanchine?)
</P>
<P>
   But when it came time for the Christmas tree to grow five
stories high and for the snow-laden forest to materialize, the
director, Emile Ardolino, replaced this genuinely awesome stage
spectacle with some not-so-special effects. Although New York City
Ballet dancers looked great in Act II, the special ``Nutcracker''
buzz created by those transformation scenes was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's a place for truly informed commentary as a
complement to televised dance. ( McKenzie could have been amusing
as well as instructive by explaining how ``Corsaire'' arrived, via
Boston Ballet, with a brace of choreographers and five composers in
its credits.) What's not needed is more of the taped blandness that
occupied the intermission of last summer's live telecast of Peter
Martins's ``Swan Lake'' at City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Sills, who can always be counted on to keep a
conversation bubbling along, chatted up Martins and the rather wary
looking scheduled stars of the performance, Darci Kistler and
Damian Woetzel.
</P>
<P>
   Martins's instantly controversial production had already raised
many questions _ Why was Rotbart shown hexing the Prince in Act I?
Why use a pestiferous Soviet-style Jester? Just exactly what did
the designer, Per Kirkeby, think he was up to? _ but Ms. Sills
genially skirted most of them.
</P>
<P>
   The segment had already been overtaken by events anyway. An
aggravated injury had forced Ms. Kistler to cancel, and Miranda
Weese replaced her on exceedingly short notice; an interview with
Ms. Weese at intermission would certainly have proved newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Intermission interviews, once a fixture of live PBS telecasts,
also inject a note of extra risk. Who can forget Dick Cavett's
breathlessly assuring Ms. Makarova that Act III of ``Swan Lake,''
which she had just performed, was the best act of any ballet he had
ever seen, and her turning a hooded glance upon him and saying,
``So what was wrong with Act II?'' Live dance on television doesn't
get any livelier than that.

3-WAY MERGER WILL CHALLENGE JAPANESE PHONE GIANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MANNESMANN-VODAFONE) 
(mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's dominant telecommunications company confronted a
new competitive challenge at home Thursday with the announcement
that three smaller rivals would soon be merging.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of KDD Corp., IDO Corp. and DDI Corp., to be
completed by next October, would create a new telephone and data
transmission business that would be No. 2 domestically to Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Such a merger had been rumored for weeks. Although it would
remain smaller in size than NTT, it would effectively present
Japanese customers with a full-service alternative to Japan's
telephone giant, a former government monopoly that had been largely
unchallenged at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``NTT is further strengthening its grip on the market, and we
felt a need to create a group that can compete with NTT,'' Yusai
Okuyama, president of DDI and designated president of the new
company, also to be known as DDI, said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Since its reorganization in July, NTT has tightened its grasp on
the local phone market, carved its business into highly focused
pieces under a holding company structure, and begun to take aim at
providing international phone services. It is the parent of two
highly successful subsidiaries, NTT Mobile Communications Network
Corp., better known as NTT DoCoMo, and NTT Communications, which
specializes in data transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Part of NTT's strength, however, lay in the fragmented nature of
the telecom industry here, and the merger announced Thursday marks
the beginning of the end of that advantage.
</P>
<P>
   DDI will be able to offer its customers everything that NTT
offers them except local telephone service, which is increasingly
under pressure anyway from the proliferation of mobile telephones
and the services available on them. DDI is Japan's second-largest
cellular phone service company after NTT DoCoMo, which controls 57
percent of the market, and IDO is a privately held mobile phone
company in which Toyota Motor Corp. has a 63 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   The merged company does have some competitive drawbacks. In a
business where size and geographic reach can make a difference, DDI
will be only one-third the size of NTT, with projected revenue of
2.69 trillion yen in the fiscal year that will end March 31, 2001,
or roughly $26 billion at current exchange rates. NTT estimates
that its revenue for the year that will end March 31 will be 10.7
trillion yen, or almost $104 billion.
</P>
<P>
   DDI also will be saddled with debts of 1.9 trillion yen, or
roughly $18.4 billion. That debt load might crimp its ability to
invest in new so-called third-generation mobile telephone
technology that can trasmit voice, data and video signals, the
starting point for the discussions between the three merger
partners. All wanted an opportunity to win one of the three
licenses to offer the third-generation phone services that the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will hand out next year,
but alone, none of them was a likely candidate.
</P>
<P>
   DDI, which is bringing most of the debt to the new company,
lacked the investment capital needed. KDD has no cellular phone
service and its international phone services are under severe
pricing pressure. And while IDO has wealthy Toyota as a financial
backer, it is tiny compared with the other players in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, none of the three was able to attract an international
partner, which many analysts see as critical to success as the
telecom business becomes increasingly global.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Telecom, which will be the third-largest
telecommunications company after the merger, has linked up with
British Telecom, Vodafone AirTouch and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The new DDI might make a more attractive partner, and KDD has
said it has had talks with France Telecom and Deutsche Telecom, as
well as with the Internet-related telecom companies Global Crossing
and Qwest Communications.

INJURED CELTICS FACING TWO AWAY GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Celtics are staggering, weakened by injuries. They
have lost three straight, and they are about to hit the road, where
they have won just once this season.
</P>
<P>
   But coach Rick Pitino remains optimistic as the Celtics prepare
to play in San Antonio and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can win both games,'' Pitino said Thursday. ``But it will
take a great night from more people offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker carried the Celtics in their 96-86 loss to Utah
Wednesday night. Walker took charge from the power forward spot and
had 36 points and 12 rebounds. But without Paul Pierce (ankle) or
Vitaly Potapenko (calf) available, no other Celtic frontcourt
player presented a threat.
</P>
<P>
   But Pitino is also being realistic. He plans to shift Walker to
the small forward position for at least part of Friday night's
game, relying on Tony Battie and Pervis Ellison, and preparing for
the return of power forward Danny Fortson in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics entered the week above .500, but losses at Cleveland
(115-88) and to Utah within 24 hours dropped their record to 10-11.
Now, they must prepare for the Spurs' Tim Duncan and David
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played hard, but we didn't play intelligently against
Cleveland,'' Pitino said. ``And we played hard, and we played well
against Utah. But playing hard is not enough against some of these
great teams. You've also got to make shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics weren't making their shots against Utah, which left
them unable to press. The Jazz took control with an effective
transition game and a masterful half-court attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking reserves who are by nature not scorers and
putting them in scoring roles, and it's difficult for them,'' said
Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan scored 31 points as the Spurs defeated the Celtics,
121-98, Nov. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll be able to make adjustments against San
Antonio the second time around,'' Pitino said. ``If you concentrate
on (Duncan and Robinson), they have spot-up shooters who can kill
you. Plus, they are unselfish and play good defense. They have the
size to keep you off the backboards. We are going to have to hit
our perimeter shots because they don't give you too much inside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say enough about Tim Duncan, but (the Spurs) can be
stopped,'' guard Adrian Griffin said. ``It will take a team effort,
and a lot of weak-side help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do what we try to do in every game: play our style.
Once you let the other team play to their style, it's to their
advantage. We've played well against these teams before. We just
have to go out and compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Battie will be a central figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we played them, we did a decent job with their
big men,'' Battie said. ``But we didn't do as well with our
defensive rotation, and they killed us down the stretch from the
outside. If me or Pervis gets in foul trouble, we are in trouble.''

</P>
<P>
   The 10 candidates do not include Laffit Pincay's record ride.
</P>
<P>
   So we've written down our own list of memorable moments and
other notable developments of 1999, roughly in order of
significance, with updates on the lead characters.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay's record: His 8,834th win, aboard Irish Nip last Friday
at Hollywood Park, capped the racing achievement of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, seeking his first riding title since 1991, goes into the
last four days at Hollywood Park trailing Pat Valenzuela by one
after winning Thursday aboard Wine With Pride and Road to Slew.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pincay, 52, is working on plans for a world tour. His
plan to sign posters Saturday at Hollywood Park was canceled
because of a prior agreement with Santa Anita, which has set Laffit
Pincay Day for Jan.15.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Gonzalez's death: The 23-year-old's fatal accident at
Fairplex Park was the first in 24 years involving a Southern
California thoroughbred jockey.
</P>
<P>
   So far the J.C. Gonzalez Memorial Fund (Care of Fairplex Park,
Post Office Box 2250, Pomona, 91769) has forwarded $18,000 to his
parents. Some of that money is earmarked to establish some sort of
memorial display in Gonzalez's native Yahualica, Jalisco, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic: After his victories in the Kentucky Derby (at 31-1)
and Preakness (8-1), the nation proved it never tires of a Triple
Crown bid.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be spring before Charismatic has recovered from the severe
leg injury that left him a hobbling third in the Belmont. Forays
out of his stall at Lane's End Farm in Kentucky were curtailed
recently because ``he was getting a little too rambunctious,''
prompting fears of reinjury, said farm spokeswoman Jill McCully.
</P>
<P>
   The injury shouldn't limit Charismatic's breeding ability.
McCully said he's already ``practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Antley's comeback: The jockey saved his career from weight
problems _ and might have saved Charismatic's life by jumping off
quickly after the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Antley had knee and nasal surgery and hasn't ridden at Hollywood
Park. He'll have to shed weight _ though not as much as a year ago
_ before a return expected in January at Santa Anita, according to
agent Ron Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Bob Baffert-D. Wayne Lukas rivalry: Baffert's chances for a
third consecutive Eclipse Award plummeted when Lukas upstaged him
with Charismatic in the Triple Crown and Cash Run and Cat Thief at
the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Valhol scandal: The long shot's Arkansas Derby victory in
April was voided after jockey Billy Patin was found to have carried
a battery.
</P>
<P>
   In what might be the story's last legal chapter, the
disqualification and Patin's five-year suspension were upheld by a
county judge Monday. Valhol is expected to race at age 4 after
recovering from a knee chip.
</P>
<P>
   Nasal strips: The breathing aids, new to the horse world, went
from major curiosity to minor controversy when Cash Run ($67),
Anees ($62.60) and Cat Thief ($41.20) wore them in Breeders' Cup
wins.
</P>
<P>
   Nine states are permitting the use of the strips. California
officials aren't, pending further study. Enthusiasm may be waning
anyway. Writer Andy Beyer studied results at the Churchill Downs
fall meet, and concluded the average horse's performance wasn't
affected by the strips.
</P>
<P>
   TVG's debut: Santa Monica-based Television Games Network marks
the racing industry's boldest step into a future dominated by
in-home betting.
</P>
<P>
   After drawing critical early reviews in August and stumbling
through coverage of Gonzalez's death in September, TVG has polished
its presentation and earned praise for its work on Pincay's record
run.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita's new management: While TVG tries to keep racing
fans on their couches, Frank Stronach tries to lure them back to
Santa Anita with a high-priced makeover of the nation's most
beautiful racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Stronach's second year begins with the opening of an 87-day
season Dec. 26, featuring a glitzy new restaurant, The FrontRunner.
</P>
<P>
   NTRA series debuts: The latest attempt to create a television
storyline by linking major races for older horses consisted of 11
events and culminated with Del Mar's Pacific Classic, rendered
meaningless by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A new format for 2000 is designed to encourage participation
with more frequent bonuses and less emphasis on the climactic race.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: Baffert, who won the Hollywood Futurity with Real
Quiet in 1997, that colt's first step toward winning the Derby and
Preakness, will saddle three of the seven 2-year-olds entered in
Saturday's running of the 1 1/16-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Albarado is in town to ride Captain Steve, the favorite
off his 5{-length victory in the Kentucky Jockey Club at Churchill
Downs. David Flores rides Cameron Pass and Kent Desormeaux has
Purely Cozzene.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas will try to spoil another day for Baffert with Hopeful
winner High Yield (Corey Nakatani).
</P>
<P>
   Lukas' Surfside (Pat Day) heads the Hollywood Starlet on
Sunday. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A strongly worded report issued on Thursday by
an international panel of experts holds both the United Nations and
leading member countries, primarily the United States, responsible
for failing to prevent or stop the genocide in Rwanda in 1994,
which cost hundreds of thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   The report, commissioned by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who
was then head of the peacekeeping department, spares no one, naming
those in the highest reaches of the United Nations who were running
the operation in Rwanda, including Annan and his predecessor,
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
   The genocide in Rwanda, which took place in 1994 when Hutu began
to massacre Tutsi and moderate Hutu, set off a chain reaction that
led to the current war in Congo, the former Zaire, involving more
than half a dozen African nations.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations sent a small peacekeeping force to the area
in 1993 after repeated warnings about the growing ethnic conflict
in the civil war between the Hutu-led government of Rwanda and the
Tutsi-led armed opposition. But the presence of the peacekeeping
force was not enough to prevent the killing of an estimated 800,000
people from April to July 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The panel found that Annan and others in his department made
weak and equivocal decisions in the face of mounting disaster. At
the same time the Clinton administration _ represented at the
United Nations by Madeleine Albright _ persistently played down the
problem, setting the tone for a Security Council generally lacking
the political will for a tougher response.
</P>
<P>
   Both the United Nations and the United States sent the wrong
message to militias bent on genocide, the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Annan called the report ``thorough and objective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On behalf of the United Nations, I acknowledge this failure
and express my deep remorse,'' he said, calling the events in
Rwanda ``genocide in its purest and most evil form.'' In Rwanda,
government officials said the secretary-general should visit and
apologize in person.
</P>
<P>
   But the leader of the investigation, Ingvar Carlsson, a former
Swedish prime minister, did not place all the blame on the United
Nations. At a news conference on Thursday, he said it would
``always be difficult to explain'' why the Security Council _
managed by the world's major powers and not the U.N. bureaucracy _
decimated the peacekeeping force in Rwanda, reducing it to a few
hundred from 2,500 troops when the genocide began, and then
increasing the force to 5,500 when the weeks of massacres were
over.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which provided Carlsson's investigators with
minimal help and no documents during their six-month study,
effectively blocked the Security Council in 1993 and 1994 from
authorizing any significant action in Rwanda. No high-ranking
American officials involved in policy making at the time agreed to
meet the panel.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department said on Thursday that it had cooperated
fully with the investigation, adding that the United States has a
policy of not releasing classified documents to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We disagree with their assessment,'' said James B. Foley, a
State Department spokesman. ``We provided senior officials who
extensively briefed the panel and answered all their questions
satisfactorily.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley said those officials included William Woods, deputy
assistant secretary of state for international organizations, and
Richard Bogosian, one of the department's top Africa specialists.
Both men had studied all the records of the period and discussed
them with the panel, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Carlsson repeated the Clinton administration's
explanation that the loss of 18 American Rangers in Somalia in
October 1993 had scared the United States off peacekeeping for
domestic political reasons, particularly peacekeeping in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Carlsson said blame rested with ``those who didn't care at all,
who said Rwanda is a distant African country.'' On a trip to Rwanda
last year, President Clinton apologized for Washington's inaction.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations opened its archives and made all its former
officials available to the panel on Annan's orders. A U.N. official
said this led to an ``asymmetry'' in the damning details by which
U.N. actions could be judged compared with those of pivotal
governments. Belgium and France, whose peacekeepers were in the
field in Rwanda before and after the genocide, have conducted their
own investigations. The United States has not.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that about 800,000 people were killed in 100
days from April to July 1994, in a Hutu-led campaign of genocide
against Tutsi and moderate Hutu who often defended their neighbors
with their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Annan appointed the three-member panel in May to conduct an
independent investigation into the U.N. role in the critical months
in Rwanda. Besides Carlsson, the members were Han Sung-joo of South
Korea, a former foreign minister and leading international affairs
scholar, and Rufus M. Kupolati of Nigeria, a retired lieutenant
general familiar with U.N. peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
   The report carries no force but highlights the difficulties that
the United Nations has in gaining support for increasingly complex
and dangerous peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
   It follows by several weeks the release of an internal U.N.
inquiry into problems in the Bosnia peacekeeping operation that led
to thousands of deaths in Serbian attacks on Bosnian Muslims in
Srebrenica and other towns. That report also found fault with both
the organization and Security Council members.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The report issued on Thursday shows a pattern of ignored
warnings and missed signs of the genocide to come in Rwanda.
Reports from the commander in the field, Gen. Romeo A. Dallaire of
Canada, of plans for ethnic attacks and accumulating arms caches
were not taken seriously enough or passed high enough up in the
organization for immediate attention, the panel found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information received by a United Nations mission that plans
are being made to exterminate any group of people requires and
immediate and determined response,'' the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   It also said U.N. headquarters in New York should have given
more weight to reports from Rwanda peacekeepers that arms caches
were being assembled by the Hutu militia. Instead it was decided
that confiscating arms was not in the mandate of the force. The
Security Council had made that clear, Kupolati said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that ``instructions from New York not to
seize weapons'' gave the signal to the Hutu militia that the
peacekeepers were not likely to ``take assertive action to deal
with such caches.''
</P>
<P>
   The report does not support accusations that Boutros-Ghali was
personally responsible for ignoring warnings of genocide, though it
does say he prevented officials in day-to-day contact with Rwanda
from briefing the Security Council. The panel found that a cable
from Dallaire in January 1994 warning of Hutu plans for massacres
of Tutsi was not immediately shown to Boutros-Ghali, whom some
politicians and others in Europe have tried to charge with
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The information was shared with the embassies of Belgium, France
and the United States in Rwanda, which were asked soon after the
cable was received to warn the Hutu-led government of President
Juvenal Habyarimana not to allow any such attacks. Diplomats
relayed the information to their capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the report, ``Independent Inquiry into the Actions of
the United Nations During the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda,'' is a
painstaking chronological reconstruction of the crisis beginning
the year before the killings. The panel noted that various reports
during that time had provided early warning of the increasingly
dangerous ethnic dimensions of the ongoing civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Among the signals was a report by the United Nations Human
Rights Commission expert on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary
executions, Waly Bacre Ndiaye, which suggested that genocide was
possible. The report seemed to have been largely ignored at the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after a peace agreement was signed between the Hutu-led
government of Rwanda and the Tutsi-led armed opposition, the Rwanda
Patriotic Front, in August 1993, a joint delegation came to New
York to sound an alarm that the agreement could fall apart and to
plead for more than 4,000 U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later Boutros-Ghali recommended a force about half that
size, but that was cut back further by the Security Council.
Dallaire was appointed commander. Aware of the ethnic volatility in
Rwanda, he proposed rules of engagement for his forces _ which the
investigation found were often ill trained and ill equipped _ to
let them intervene in crimes against humanity. U.N. headquarters
never responded to his request for approval.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 11, Dallaire sent his cable warning of major trouble,
which has become the center of accusations that the United Nations
could have predicted genocide and did nothing. The cable was sent
to Maj. Gen. Maurice Baril, a Canadian who was a military adviser
to Boutros-Ghali. In it, Dallaire said that in addition to
information about arms caches and a campaign to list all Tutsi and
others apparently being selected for death, there were plans to
assassinate opposition members of parliament and provoke Belgian
peacekeepers into using force, which would prompt Hutu to kill a
few of them and force their withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, then head of peacekeeping in New York, sent Dallaire and
the United Nations' special envoy in Rwanda, Jacques-Roger Booh
Booh, to talk to Habyarimana, who denied that his officers or Hutu
militias were planning attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Fears continued to mount in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, until
April 6, 1994, when a plane carrying Habyarimana and President
Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi was apparently shot down while
approaching Kigali airport. Hutu radicals seized the moment and
unleashed the genocidal campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the bloody melee that followed, groups of U.N. peacekeepers
were rounded up by Rwandan Hutu troops and 10 Belgians were
executed. The remaining Belgians, the best-qualified soldiers among
the peacekeepers, were then abruptly withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Belgium was criticized for this and for
abandoning 2,000 civilians hiding in a technical school after
telling them they would be protected. They were savagely attacked.
The Belgian withdrawal prompted others to pull out, an action
supported by the United States, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of other Rwandans died when they fled to churches,
assuming that houses of worship would be places of refuge and
safety. Carlsson, who remembers as a boy of 10 seeing survivors of
the Nazi Holocaust being trucked out of Germany in white buses,
said his most searing memory of Rwanda was one pair of tiny shoes
still lying in a churchyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pair of small shoes from, evidently, a 3-year-old
girl,'' he said, ``her crime being that she was a Tutsi or belonged
to a moderate Hutu family. She probably didn't know about the world
yet. I can assure you I will never forget, I will never forget
those two shoes.''

 By AMY WALDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An appellate court ordered the trial of the four
officers charged with murdering Amadou Diallo to be moved to Albany
County, ruling on Thursday that a fair trial would be impossible in
the Bronx because of ``the public clamor'' about the case.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member panel of the Supreme Court Appellate Division
ruled that ``this case cannot be tried in Bronx County, or anywhere
else in the City of New York, without an atmosphere in which jurors
would be under enormous pressure to reach the verdict demanded by
public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 4 shooting of Diallo outside his apartment in the Bronx
sparked large demonstrations against the police, including rallies
outside One Police Plaza that resulted in arrests of celebrities
and high-profile New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, in which 41 shots were fired, was held up as proof
by many people that police frequently react harshly in dealing with
minorities, and it has been the subject of intense news coverage.
Diallo, who was unarmed, was black and the officers who shot him
are white.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, the appellate court wrote: ``We conclude that
this case has been deluged by a tidal wave of prejudicial publicity
to such an extent that even an attempt to select an unbiased jury
would be fruitless.''
</P>
<P>
   The court cited several depictions of the case from media
sources, including a controversial cover on The New Yorker magazine
that showed a smiling police officer shooting at a human cut-out
bearing the words: ``41 shots, 10 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   The court noted that moving a trial in a high-profile case is
``an extraordinary remedy reserved for the rarest of cases,'' but
added that the shooting of Diallo ``is that rare case.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling was immediately denounced by prosecutors and
by Diallo's family. ``I could not disagree more strongly with the
court's decision, which cannot be appealed, to change the place of
trial of the four police officers,'' Robert T. Johnson, the Bronx
district attorney, said in a statement. ``What makes this decision
particularly disturbing is that absolutely no effort was invested
to even attempt to empanel a fair and impartial Bronx jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision, the statement concluded, ``reflects a lack
of trust of the jury selection process in general and of Bronx
jurors in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani reacted to the decision with a vigorous
defense of the police force, which he has often said has been
unfairly judged. ``The rhetoric made it appear as if they were
absolutely guilty and there's no question about it,'' Giuliani said
at a news conference. ``Whether that's true or not, you're entitled
to a fair trial, and I think the judges said, `We're going to treat
police officers the way we treat all other human beings. They're
entitled to a fair trial also.' I think a number of people do not
treat police officers as human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's parents also expressed dismay over the decision. ``We
waited all this time for justice,'' Saiku Diallo, the victim's
father, said at a press conference at the Harlem headquarters of
the Rev. Al Sharpton, an adviser to the family. ``It will be
harmful to me and my family to travel to this place where we've
never been.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadiadou Diallo, Diallo's mother, was also upset by the
decision. ``We don't want our agony to be prolonged, we want
justice. This is not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   But Patrick Lynch, the president of Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, hailed the decision, calling it ``an opportunity for
these four officers to have a trial that is judged on the facts,
not the politics or other folks' political agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said, ``The court decision
speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The four officers _ Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss, Richard Murphy
and Edward McMellon _ are each facing two counts of second-degree
murder and one count of reckless endangerment. In a motion filed
last month, lawyers for the four men argued that the amount of
publicity the shooting has received, as well as the demonstrations
organized by Sharpton and others, had irrevocably tainted the jury
pool in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also cited the ``conventional wisdom'' that police
officers cannot get a fair trial in Bronx County, which is
populated largely by blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitutional guarantee of the option of a jury trial is
effectively precluded to these defendants,'' said the motion, which
was written by Bennett M. Epstein, a lawyer for Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution had contended that the defense had taken media
coverage out of context and omitted accounts that were favorable to
the officers. The notion that police officers could not get a fair
trial in the Bronx was ``unfounded and unsupported,'' the
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   But the court agreed that some of the publicity was likely to
influence jurors. It cited three examples: The New Yorker cover, a
New York Post column that repeated the word ``bang'' 41 times and
an advertisement by the American Civil Liberties Union that
displayed 41 bullet holes along with the Miranda warning that
begins, ``You have the right to remain silent.'' The ad goes on to
say, ``On February 4th, 1999, the NYPD gave Amadou Diallo the right
to remain silent.''
</P>
<P>
   The five judges, all of whom were appointed by Gov. George
Pataki, said they had decided to move the trial to Albany County
because it is an urban county and is not home to large numbers of
New York City law enforcement officials. After surveying census
data on a number of counties with ``a reasonable degree of ethnic
diversity,'' the court selected Albany County.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. Census data from 1998, Albany's nearly 300,000
residents are 85.8 percent white, 9.2 percent black, 2.7 percent
Asian and 2.3 percent Hispanic. The Bronx's 1.19 million people are
48.3 Hispanic, 29.4 black, 18.6 white, and 3.7 Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers were ``dumbstruck,'' in one attorney's word, by
Thursday's decision to move the trial. ``It is a big victory, a big
victory,'' said Steven Brounstein, the lawyer for Boss. ``Now
hopefully we'll get a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers were uniformly described as pleased by the news
that the trial would go to Albany County. Stephen Worth, the lawyer
for McMellon, said that his client ``was as surprised and pleased
as we were that the Appellate Division had responded to our
argument.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Culleton, the lawyer for Murphy, said the officers
have already been so damaged by negative publicity that moving the
trial would not be much help. ``The severity of this indictment
stemmed directly from the pretrial publicity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, who led demonstrations in which former Mayor David
Dinkins, actress Susan Sarandon and more than 1,000 other people
were arrested, called the decision ``outrageous'' and
``unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a police officer in the Bronx, how come you can't be
tried in the Bronx where you have arrested people and had them
tried,'' Sharpton said, adding later, ``They cannot disenfranchise
a whole county.''

YEAR 2000 PREPARATIONS WERE COSTLY, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation will be warm and secure on Jan. 1, the
federal government predicted Thursday, but the Year 2000 computer
problem has made it a little poorer.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said Thursday that it was ready for the Year 2000,
but that it had spent $3.6 billion, enough to buy an aircraft
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department said that all the electric utilities in
the United States are ready for Jan. 1, but industry
representatives said the utilities had spent $2.5 billion, the
price of several power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Management and Budget estimated on Wednesday that
federal expenses relating to the Year 2000 problem would total
$8.38 billion over five years, ending next September.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the General Accounting Office found that 24 agencies it
surveyed expected to spend $7.5 billion, which was up sharply from
earlier estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The expenditures were intended to root out computer coding that
stored the date as a two-digit number and could read the year after
1999 as 1900 instead of 2000, and then malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   The spending had some side benefits. The Federal Aviation
Administration said Thursday that it, too, was ready, after
spending $368 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have a very up-to-date, accurate inventory of all our
systems,'' said Mary Powers-King, who is in charge of the Year 2000
transition at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, she said, the air traffic control system probably
would have run about the same if nothing had been done because it
does not use the year in handing minute-to-minute tasks. But
various administrative systems would not have run without
renovation, Ms. Powers-King said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on Thursday concentrated on progress, not cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate absolutely no problems in the Department of
Defense,'' said John Hamre, the deputy secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   He said all but two of the 2,101 systems crucial to the Pentagon
are ready. Those two are internal data management systems in the
National Imagery and Mapping Agency. There are 5,500 other systems,
only 10 of which have not been cleared, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating to say that we had to spend $3.6
billion,'' Hamre said. But, ``We could not stand the consequence if
we had not spent the $3.6 billion. In the process, we have much,
much better positive control over our information systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The energy secretary, Bill Richardson, said the last seven of
the more than 3,000 companies that supply electricity in the United
States have now reported that they are ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``With just 16 days until the year 2000, all American customers
will be serviced by Y2K-ready power companies by the new year,''
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that oil supplies could be disrupted if other countries
have problems, but that Mexico, Venezuela, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
have agreed to step up production if that happens.
</P>
<P>
   But the chairman of another agency, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, warned that while all fuel distribution
systems should be able to cope with normal demand, gasoline
supplies could run out if consumers hoarded gasoline in
anticipation of a shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, James Hoecker, who coordinated the preparedness of
natural gas companies for the year 2000, said that his agency was
ready.
</P>
<P>
   But he urged consumers ``to be prudent, to be prepared, but not
to make energy-purchasing decisions they would not normally make.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to hoard or store dangerous fuels, for
example,'' Hoecker said. ``There are important reasons not to do
that. Nor do we want unexpected demands placed on distribution
networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and Hoecker, along with executives from the electric
and natural gas industries, delivered a ``final report card'' on
the energy industries Thursday at a Potomac Electric Power Co.
control center in suburban Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of that utility, John Derrick, said that half of
his company's employees would be ``on shift or on call'' on New
Year's Eve and the early hours of New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also said Thursday that the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, a half-billion-barrel stockpile maintained by the federal
government, might be used in case of a supply interruption.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had already taken the legal step of advising the
president to open the reserve, which must be done two weeks in
advance of using the oil. But he added that his recommendation was
just a precaution. ``I don't want to move markets,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jamie H. Hughes stood outside his building on Wheeler
Avenue on Thursday, across the street from where Amadou Diallo was
shot at 41 times, and said words that were echoing throughout his
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he said, he had heard that the four police officers who
opened fire on Diallo would be tried in Albany County, and not in
the Bronx. And yes, he said, he was angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair,'' Hughes said, standing near his car in the
cold evening, hands wedged deep into the pockets of his leather
jacket. ``If justice is what we are seeking, and if justice is
working, then I think everybody should be treated equally. A normal
person who gets arrested in the Bronx would not get a trial outside
the Bronx. So why should they?''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, 29, a building superintendent, might as well have been
speaking for most of those in his neighborhood, where bewilderment
and disappointment greeted the news that a state appellate court
had ordered the police officers' murder trial to be moved upstate.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate panel said the change of venue would ensure that
the officers would receive a fair trial, and that jurors would be
less likely to be influenced by the intense pretrial publicity. But
among residents of Wheeler Avenue, and passers-by on the streets
nearby, the feeling was much different.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they recalled details: Diallo, a street vendor with
no criminal record, was struck by 19 of the 41 police bullets. He
was unarmed. He died on his own doorstep, where the bullet holes
still mark the hallway, and the door's wooden frame shows splinters
where the bullets passed through.
</P>
<P>
   All of this happened in the Bronx, they said, and that's where
the trial belongs: where concerned residents could attend the
trial, and where local jurors could hear the facts, one by one, as
the case unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel strong about everything that happened,'' said Omar
D. Jackson, 25, a cable wireman who lives two doors down from where
the shooting occurred. ``Once they move the trial out of the Bronx,
I think some slack will be cut.''
</P>
<P>
   A few houses farther up the street, Allison Boodram, 18, stood
on her doorstep with her 5-year-old sister, Vada, and said she was
disappointed. She knew Diallo, and had been eager to see the police
officers in the courtroom, and to hear an explanation _ any
explanation _ for why so many shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping that when it started in January, that I would be
able to go to the courthouse,'' Ms. Boodram said. ``But Albany? Who
can go there?''
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the street, Diallo's friends and neighbors had
questions, some for the appellate panel, some for the police
officers. Did the appellate judges think the people of the Bronx
could not be fair? Would the jury in Albany be racially diverse?
Would the prosecutors be aggressive if they were far from the local
scene, working in a climate with less political tension?
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the ultimate question, the one that almost
everybody had. Lou Guzman, 25, a Rite-Aid stock clerk who lives on
Wheeler Avenue, put it simply: ``I would like to know, I would like
to hear it myself: Why did it take 41 shots?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he framed another: ``Did they honestly think they could get
away with it?''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, a police cruiser eased down the street, and the
officers inside fixed their views stonily ahead. They did not stop,
avoiding contact with the reporters and the residents who had taken
up station on the street.
</P>
<P>
   But later, after the cold had chased most of the residents
inside and the reporters away, a few police officers offered their
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the intense feelings on Wheeler Avenue underscored the
soundness of the judges' decision. The depth of the divide between
the police and the residents of the Bronx is too great, they said,
for a case like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that was me on trial, and I had a choice, I'd rather be out
of the borough,'' one officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Another officer, standing on Westchester Avenue, less than a
block from where Diallo died, said the move to Albany was the four
officers' best chance for a fair hearing. Whatever the facts of the
case, and the tactics of the officers' defense, the people of the
Bronx, he said, would hear nothing of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is known throughout the department that you can't get a
fair trial here,'' he said. ``You have to get a change of venue or
a judge trial. Either that, or you go to jail _ and then you close
the cell door behind you.''

   GERMANY: KOHL INQUIRY BEGINS
</P>
<P>
   Parliament began an investigation into allegations that former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party accepted bribes. Kohl has admitted
he used secret accounts to pay for campaign activities of his
Christian Democratic Party, a violation of finance laws. The
inquiry will also examine allegations that Kohl's party received a
$1.6 million donation in exchange for the sale of a group of
state-owned apartments, which went for well below a rival bid.

   RUSSIA: JAILED AS SPY
</P>
<P>
   A former top official of the foreign ministry's Asian
department, Valentin Moiseyev, was sentenced to 12 years in prison
after being convicted of spying for South Korea. Moiseyev was
accused in a 1998 espionage case in which a South Korean diplomat
was expelled and Seoul's foreign minister resigned.

<P>
   ITALY: POLITICAL MANEUVERING
</P>
<P>
   Political uncertainty deepened after a member of Parliament had
a heart attack and other deputies accused Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema's government of seeking to buy votes to firm up his fraying
center-left coalition. But the lower house passed a budget,
clearing the way for Senate approval by the weekend. D'Alema has
said he will quit if he cannot form a new coalition once the budget
is passed.

bridges and threaten to take over a bridge connecting Argentina
with Uruguay that is vital to trade.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: BUDGET FAILS TO PASS
</P>
<P>
   In a raucous session, the Congress failed to approve the federal
budget for next year and scheduled a special session for the vote
next Tuesday and Wednesday. The lower house did pass the revenue
law for 2000, which raised the expected average price of petroleum
to $16 a barrel from the $15.50 proposed by the government.

SPORTS COLUMN:  GRIFFEY NEEDS TO DO WHAT HE DOES BEST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. needs to play in a game somewhere, anywhere,
soon. Even if it were one of those silly, celebrity softball games
on MTV, Junior needs to show us that sweet swing, that majestic
arm, the climbing-up-the-outfield-fence catches and that
once-ubiquitous smile.
</P>
<P>
   Remind us why he is the best player in baseball, and why we love
to watch him. Give us some evidence to return our murky minds to
baseball and the reasons we stare at him in awe. Even watching
Griffey wave a stickball bat would be much more preferable to
digesting these soap opera details about where he will permit the
Seattle Mariners to trade him on this day or that day.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Griffey's wonderful talents as a future Hall of
Famer have been temporarily nudged aside by this saga over the last
six weeks. It has been tedious to digest the evolving decisions
that Griffey has made since telling the Mariners that an
unprecedented $135 million contract could not coax him to stay with
them beyond next season, and that he instead wanted to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   That is his prerogative. The Mariners might not even still call
Seattle home and Safeco Field might not exist if it were not for
Griffey. As a 10-year veteran who has played 5 years with his
current team, Griffey has sacrificed and starred for the Mariners
and has earned the valuable right to determine his future by being
able to veto trades.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey squashed a potential trade to the Mets late Monday
night, a deal that would have inserted him in front of Mike Piazza
in the lineup on a stellar team that crawled to within two
victories of the World Series last season. How could a hungry
player who watched the Mets soar, stagger and soar again during an
incredible dash, not be intrigued enough to give New York a
one-year tryout?
</P>
<P>
   The two-time World Series champion Yankees are a borough away
and Griffey could have elevated the Mets to the Yankees' lofty
status. If Griffey wanted to exceed his two postseason experiences
with Seattle, he should have pondered how rewarding it could be in
New York in October. But Griffey, the biggest star in the sport,
had no interest in this enticing notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' said Piazza, ``you don't know what a guy is
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   What is Griffey thinking?
</P>
<P>
   Probably that everything will eventually unfold the way he wants
and he would be correct. Griffey has serious leverage over the
Mariners and envisions himself pursuing Hank Aaron's career home
run record in Cincinnati, the city where his father could be the
next manager and where Junior grew up. Eventually, this will be a
homey image. Getting there has been, and will continue to be,
unsightly.
</P>
<P>
   It was no coincidence that the Mariners called a news conference
as soon as Griffey asked for a trade. As amazing a player as
Griffey is, one Mariners official said he used the word ``control''
too often, sounding more like a cranky new owner than a confident
All-Century player. The Mariners could finish first in the ordinary
American League West with Griffey, but it is improbable that he
will still be with them at the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   There was bogus talk about Griffey's wanting to play closer to
his home in Orlando, Fla., which no sane person believed. Griffey
then gave the Mariners a list of four teams (Reds, Mets, Atlanta
and Houston) that he would agree to be dealt to, but the list was
also unreliable because Griffey erased it after the Mariners
mentioned trade scenarios with teams other than the final four. So
Griffey, who is more insecure than a superstar should be, declared
that it had to be the Reds or he would remain in Seattle for
another year before becoming a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets pursued Griffey aggressively and were left feeling a
bit empty, but they must forget about Griffey and concentrate on
adding a starting pitcher and a power-hitting outfielder. Let the
thoughts about Griffey in center field at Shea Stadium vanish.
</P>
<P>
   One supermarket with an advertising marquee zipper along the
Henry Hudson Parkway in Manhattan already feels that way. The store
advertised some items on the zipper while also giving a message to
Griffey: ``We have enough obnoxious and overpaid players in New
York. And I hope you enjoy the night life in Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Griffey's right to veto potential trades and say he will
only go to Cincinnati. But it is everyone else's right to stop
caring until Griffey returns to playing baseball and restores the
appeal of the player who first entranced us a decade ago. See you
in April, Junior. Somewhere.  &QL;

   BC-IRAQ-U.N.-NYT (moved on Tuesday, Dec. 14)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Tuesday, Dec. 14,
about a delay in the Security Council's vote on a resolution
renewing arms inspections of Iraq misstated the degree to which the
country is said to have enriched a supply of uranium. According to
David Kyd, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency,
it is 2.6 percent, not 2.3 or 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also because of an editing error, the article referred
incorrectly to a comment by Paul L. Leventhal, president of the
Nuclear Control Institute, an independent organization in
Washington. He said that uranium enriched to 3 percent from 2.3
could be used to create bomb-grade uranium. He did not say that an
Iraqi supply of 1.8 tons of uranium had been enriched to 2.3 or 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The headline on the article misstated France's action. France
did not halt debate on the resolution; it delayed a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Because of another editing error, an article yesterday about
Iraq's refusal to admit inspectors from the International Atomic
Energy Agency misstated the year the United Nations imposed
economic sanctions on the country. It was 1990, after Iraq invaded
Kuwait _ not 1991, the year of the Persian Gulf war.

ABORTION FUROR IN ITALY OVER PREGNANT 13-YEAR-OLD RETARDED GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS 6th graf to delete authorities suspected incest and add
that family wanted girl to have an abortion.) 
 (rk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Teen-age pregnancies are no more unusual in Italy than
elsewhere. But the predicament of a 13-year-old retarded girl in
Sicily known only as Laura has fascinated the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a judge ruled that Laura's pregnancy should not be
ended by abortion. The judge's decision was sealed, and was
supposed to remain a secret shared only with Laura's parents and
the girl's guardian, but the news quickly leaked out.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Oreste Benzi, a local priest who led the battle to
overturn her state-appointed guardian's recommendation for an
abortion, was elated by the news, and called it ``a victory for
life.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Italians, especially those who support abortion
rights, viewed the case far differently. Valeria Ajovalasit,
president of Arcidonna, a feminist organization, told the ANSA news
agency Thursday night: ``There was too much noise around this
tragic event. A little silence would have been preferable, and
might have better served the interests of a little girl who has
serious problems and also of this unborn child.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura is the daughter of a retired farm worker and his wife, and
until recently lived with them and her grandmother in the small
town of Pozzallo. Her family doctor discovered she was pregnant a
few weeks ago. When the local child welfare services were alerted,
Laura was removed from her family until the father could be
identified. She was placed in a foster home run by a Roman Catholic
organization, and made a ward of the court.
</P>
<P>
   The family, which reportedly wanted her to have an abortion,
later identified the father as a 14-year-old playmate, who is also
retarded. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   According to Giuseppe Privitera, a Pozzallo-based reporter for
Gazzetta Del Sud who interviewed the family, the girl's parents
wanted her to have an abortion, and fiercely opposed her removal
from their home.
</P>
<P>
   Laura's first-appointed guardian, Francesco Gugliotta,
commissioner of Pozzallo's social services department, had favored
letting his charge's pregnancy come to term. But late last week,
Gugliotta was replaced by the girl's family doctor, Ignazio
Ruffino.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffino told reporters, ``I know the condition of her physical
and mental health and I am certain that she is not capable of
understanding what is happening to her.'' He recommended that the
girl should have an abortion, calling it ``the lesser evil.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not reveal how advanced the pregnancy was and that
uncertainty may have influenced the court. The girl's mother has
said that the deadline for a legal abortion would fall sometime
before Christmas. .
</P>
<P>
   Under the law in Italy, where abortion has been legal since
1978, women may have an abortion without restriction during the
first three months of pregnancy. Second-trimester abortions are
allowed only if the fetus is found to be badly damaged or the life
of the mother is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffino's recommendation unleashed the fury of anti-abortion
groups, politicians and church leaders. The Rev. Gino Concetti, a
columnist for the Vatican daily newspaper, Osservatore Romano,
described the prospect of an abortion for Laura as ``the return of
the horrors of Nazi Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   That reaction provoked an equally strong one from abortion
rights activists and other commentators. Vincenzo Consolo, a
well-known Sicilian novelist, retorted, ``The church should
remember when it helped Nazis escape to South America after the
defeat of Germany before expressing itself so outrageously in a
tragic event.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the judge's decision, Benzi, who works with the
Pope John XXIII community, a Catholic charity that arranged Laura's
foster care, released a letter he said was written by Laura to the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Judge, I want my baby,'' the letter said.``Don't let my
baby die. Let my baby grow, I beg of you. Save me.''
</P>
<P>
   Benzi is a well-known abortion opponent, and his outspoken
advocacy has raised questions about whether the girl, who is
described as having the mental capacity of a 6-year-old, could have
written such a letter without help.
</P>
<P>
   The judge made her decision Thursday after interviewing the
child.

EARLY WRIGHT, DISC JOCKEY WHO MADE THE DELTA BLUE, DIES AT 84  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early Wright, who became a legend in the blues-drenched
Mississippi Delta as one of the South's earliest black disc
jockeys, died in a Memphis hospital on Dec. 10. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   For more than half a century, Wright broadcast blues and gospel
to the people of the Delta on radio station WROX, seldom
identifying artists or song titles on the assumption that listeners
should already know them. The giants of the blues _ B.B. King,
Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson, Robert Nighthawk and Pinetop
Perkins among them _ played live on his shows. In the early 1950s,
he provided Ike Turner with one of his earliest steady gigs;
Turner's band sometimes played for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a beautiful record I dropped on you for your
listening pleasure,'' Wright would say, often as cars honked in
appreciation outside the WROX studio at the corner of Third and
Yazoo in Clarksdale, Miss., where he also lived. One night an
obscure Mississippi country boy showed up. His name was Elvis
Presley, and he impressed Wright with his politeness and
showmanship. ``He always had a motion, you know,'' the disc jockey
said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a folksy, countrified style that most characterized
Wright's broadcasting approach. In 1988 Living Blues Magazine told
of the time he plunged into a five-minute rap about an infestation
of snakes in black neighborhoods. ``I want to let you know that
some snakes has been seen in the Roundyard neighborhood,'' he
began. ``The grass has grown up around the sidewalk and the snakes
has been seen, looking for water.''
</P>
<P>
   He ignored prepared advertising copy, preferring to extemporize.
``At the M &AMP; F Grocery and Market, the aisles are so big that two
shopping carts can pass each other and never bump into each
other,'' he once said. ``And everything in the store has a price on
it. You don't have to worry about what it costs because the price
is right there on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was that ``everybody in Clarksdale thought he was
talking directly to them,'' said Jim O'Neal, a writer and record
producer who was the founding editor of Living Blues. He said
Wright ``represented radio as close to the center of the community
as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy Malvezzi of Connerly's Shoe Store in Clarksdale agreed.
``You got your money's worth with Early,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About a decade ago, Wright began to be given honors unimaginable
in 1947 when he became Mississippi's first black disc jockey.
Clarksdale named the road that went past his neat brick house, the
one with two pink flamingos in the front yard, Early Wright Drive.
The Center for Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi
established a scholarship in his name.
</P>
<P>
   Wright once said he was born on a farm at 3 a.m. on a Monday in
1915 in Jefferson, Miss. In 1937, he moved to Clarksdale and used
his expertise as a mechanic to open an auto repair business. He was
part-time manager of a gospel group, the Four Star Quartet, when
his announcement for the group caught the ears of WROX. The
white-owned station offered him a job in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   After consulting his preacher to make sure there was nothing
sinful about playing blues records on the radio, Wright decided to
give it a try. He did it six days a week almost until his death, on
what became one of America's longest-running radio programs. From 6
o'clock to 9, he was the ``Soul Man,'' playing the blues. For the
last two hours, he was ``Brother Early,'' playing gospel music.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Wright survived multiple bypass heart surgery. Three
months later his daughter, Barbara, died of lung cancer at 41.
Between his surgery and his daughter's funeral, the station was
sold. Wright decided to retire. He had a heart attack on Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Another daughter, Patricia, died of a brain tumor in 1981 at age
29. Wright is survived by his wife, Ella; two sisters, Annie Lott
of Youngstown, Ohio, and Genell Haggan of St. Louis; two brothers,
Julius Johnson of Chicago and J.T. Johnson of Casper, Wyo.; and
seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who was seldom seen without a coat and tie, once said he
``grew up on the hard part of the highway.'' He is remembered for
his personalized stream of patter. In a typical program, as
reported in The New York Times in 1989, he would introduce ``an
extinguished guest,'' then play the blues of Bobby Rush or the
gospel of the Mighty Sons of Glory, then rhapsodize about Dip's
Drive-in Laundromat. Community news _ for instance, who was about
to be ``funeralized'' _ might follow.
</P>
<P>
   He always had time for a commercial, like this one for a local
store:
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a full-figured dry goods store specializing in large
sizes with stockings up to size 200. Wow!'' he said. ``Under the
same roof is Miss Louise's Typing Service. She can do letterheads,
obituaries, funeral directories, term papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a wonderful person. Go tell her you heard about her on
the radio.''

MCCAIN, BRADLEY TEAM UP ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS that event was a taped town hall meeting for ``Nightline''in
7th graf; EDITS to conform in 3rd graf of 2nd take) 
 (rk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, N.H. _ Sen. John McCain and former Sen. Bill Bradley
joined forces across a partisan and ideological divide Thursday to
pledge support for revamping the nation's campaign finance system
and to take some sharp shots at each other's front-running
opponents for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to underscore Washington's inability to change itself,
McCain, a Republican, and Bradley, a Democrat, re-created on
national television the bipartisan handshake between President
Clinton and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich at the same location
in 1995. At the time, the president and speaker called for a
commission to study changing campaign finance laws. But nothing
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I most of all want to give the government back to the people
of this country,'' McCain said, agreeing with Bradley that
big-money interests have caused gridlock on Capitol Hill. ``I don't
believe we can do that unless we reform the finance system.''
</P>
<P>
   During their event, Bradley and McCain signed a pledge stating
that if both won their parties' nominations, they would not allow
their parties to spend soft money on their general election
campaigns. Both also support legislation to ban soft money
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money is used by the parties for activities like voter
registration and printing signs. Soft money cannot be used to help
specific candidates. But in 1996, soft money was used by both major
parties to finance so-called issue advertising that essentially
promoted the presidential candidates, violating the spirit, if not
the letter of the law.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing to ban soft money, McCain and Bradley would try to
close that loophole. But only McCain has pledged to give up soft
money unilaterally. Bradley says he'll forgo soft money as long as
the Republican nominee does, too. Neither McCain nor Bradley could
stop state parties from spending soft money, expenditures that can
also benefit presidential candidates. So they would leave a
loophole even as they attempted to close one.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's event was unusual not only because the two men are
from different parties and hold conflicting positions on issues
ranging from taxes to gun control to abortion, but also because
their personalities and campaign styles are so different. The event
was a town hall meeting taped for broadcast on the ABC News program
``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   Those disparate styles were on view from the moment they
appeared in a tent outside the Earl Bourden Senior Center here. In
his opening statement, McCain, the more combative of the two,
launched a caustic attack on Clinton and Vice President Gore,
Bradley's lone rival for the Democratic nomination, asserting that
they had debased ``every institution of government'' with their
aggressive fund raising in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scandal of the last two years was not Monica Lewinsky,''
McCain said. ``The president took the Lincoln bedroom and treated
it like a Motel 6 and he was the bell hop. And the vice president
of the United States asked monks and nuns to violate their vow of
poverty in order to pay thousands of dollars so that they could
spiritually commune with him.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to a 1996 campaign event that Gore attended at
a Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles. Gore later said he did not know
the event was a fund-raiser, a statement McCain ridiculed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the more cerebral and cautious of the two, opened with
a call for ``a bipartisanship that puts nation above party'' and
described the influence of money on politics as ``a plague'' on
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Republican and Democrat who differ on any number of
other issues, have come together because we believe that money is
eating away at the core of our government the way acid eats away at
cloth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, McCain and Bradley differ in their approach to
campaign finance reform legislation. Bradley supports public
financing of congressional elections while McCain opposes full
taxpayer financing of congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, who barely mentioned Gore during the two-hour
event, later criticized the leading Republican contender, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, who has far outpaced the other candidates
in fund raising. Bush is not participating in the federal campaign
finance system which provides matching funds to presidential
candidates who limit their spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think that the governor of Texas will demonstrate
that you can raise too much money in politics,'' Bradley said. ``I
see that he has essentially thumbed his nose at the public
financing of presidential campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men said they had not consulted each other about their
remarks beforehand, and their aides denied coordinating their
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have built their surprisingly strong outsider campaigns
around courting independent voters, a growing segment of the
electorate, particularly in New Hampshire and Iowa, the first
states to vote in next year's primary season. Aides to both men
assert that independents care more about campaign finance than the
general electorate.
</P>
<P>
   In Nashville Thursday, Gore told reporters that he would also
eschew soft money in the general election if the Republican nominee
did the same. And he said that he would make campaign finance
reform a priority as president, asserting that Bradley was a
Johnny-come-lately to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that I have supported and introduced and sponsored
and co-sponsored more than a dozen measures for more than 20 years
I think does serve as evidence that this is not just a new
political issue, this is a commitment for me of long standing,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He also took a swipe at McCain, noting that he had been one of
five senators who took large campaign contributions from Charles
Keating, a savings and loan operator who was later convicted of
fraud. The Senate Ethics Committee found that McCain had done
nothing improper.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush asserts that banning soft money would hurt
the Republican Party by strengthening the hand of labor unions,
which typically support Democrats. Though unions would be
prohibited from giving soft money under the McCain-Bradley
proposal, they could continue to support candidates with their well
financed get-out-the-vote operations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Thursday that he would support a ban on soft money
only if labor unions were also prohibited from using union dues to
support a candidate, unless each individual worker agrees to it.
``I'm for taking away corporate soft money, money where
shareholders have no say in how the money is spent,'' he said at a
news conference in Nashville. ``I'm also for taking away labor
union soft money so long as the working people have a right to
decide how their money is spent.''

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 election, the two political parties raised more than
$250 million in soft money, and various campaign finance experts
predict that the figure could more than double by election day
2000. Most of the soft money raised by the political parties has
been spent in recent elections to help elect presidential
candidates, although millions have also been spent by the national
parties to aid state and local candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While pledging to curb soft money spent on the top of the
ticket, it would be nearly impossible, even if Bradley and McCain
are nominated by their respective parties, to eliminate so-called
coordinated soft money spending, which helps elect an entire ticket
of candidates, from local office-holders to president.
</P>
<P>
   During a question-and-answer session moderated by Ted Koppel ,
McCain showed off his feistiness in a tart retort to a man who
claimed that his soft-money ban would abridge free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you sir, that's a very clever misrepresentation of my
position,'' McCain said. By comparison, Bradley handled his first
critical question by agreeing with his interlocutor's premise.
</P>
<P>
   The two men also had very different answers to a question about
whether they had ever been influenced by campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that there have been times when I have probably been
influenced because the big donor had access to my office and we
know that access is influence,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley asserted he had never been influenced by donations.
``But it's impossible in the current system to prove that because
there is always suspicion,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In several ways, Thursday's event was symbiotically useful to
each candidate. In Bradley's case, McCain was willing to blast Gore
in ways the more courtly Bradley would not. And McCain may have
benefited from Bradley's larger campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   When, for instance, Bradley pulled up outside the senior center,
a group of his supporters stood by with blue-and-white ``Bill
Bradley for President'' signs. But when McCain rolled up in his
bus, there were no supporters with banners. So Bradley's volunteers
simply turned their cardboard posters around to show another slogan
that served McCain's purposes just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Soft Money,'' they read.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ At least 15 Lebanese schoolchildren were reported
wounded Thursday, some seriously, when Israeli-allied militia
forces fired rockets at a village Israel says is a base for
Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   In an indirect acknowledgement of responsibility, the Israeli
army called the attack ``a mistake'' and said it ``expresses regret
at the injuries to civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the children were wounded while playing in the
schoolyard in the village of Arab Salim, while others were hit
inside the school building, according to teachers and other
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sitting in the classroom, and all of a sudden a shell
landed,'' said one young girl interviewed in a television report
from the southern Lebanese village Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's talks with Syria in Washington, Israeli state
television reported, Israeli officials voiced distress at what they
said was the accidental shelling of the school by militia fighters
of the South Lebanon Army. Though nominally autonomous, the
Israeli-equipped South Lebanon Army fights in tandem with Israeli
troops in the southern Lebanese border zone that Israel has
occupied since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   David Levy, Israel's foreign minister, told an Israeli
television interviewer in Washington that the Syrians were
concerned about an escalation of the southern Lebanon conflict.
``It is clear to them that if the fighting continues in Lebanon, it
will damage everything that we are doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut, Lebanon's president, Emile Lahoud, issued a statement
saying he ``condemns the crime and places the responsibility for it
on Israel and those who are collaborating with Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The village of Arab Salim is north of the Israeli-controlled
border zone in an area partly controlled by the insurgent
Hezbollah, or Party of God, which has been backed in the past by
both Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Ephraim Sneh, Israel's deputy defense minister, put the blame
for Thursday's incident on Hezbollah, which he said has been
staging artillery attacks from residential areas. ``When we react,
something like this is likely to occur, sad though it may be,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army said in its brief official statement that the
South Lebanon Army had returned artillery fire ``toward the source
of terrorist fire'' near the village of Arab Selim, and had
unintentionally hit populated areas. ``Firing from populated areas
endangers residents, as it requires a response against the source
of the fire,'' the statement said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The army did not provide its own information about the
casualties and made no specific mention of the schoolchildren. Its
statement did say, however, that three local Lebanese women had
been wounded recently by Hezbollah artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing retaliation for the school shelling, residents of
Israeli border areas prepared Thursday for a possible evacuation to
bomb shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and South Lebanon Army forces have had intensive
firefights with Hezbollah units for the last two days, an
escalation that some commentators here interpreted as a signal that
Hezbollah is no longer beholden to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has said it plans to withdraw from southern Lebanon next
year, either unilaterally or through a negotiated agreement with
Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, who is concluding
his first round of peace talks with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel in Washington Thursday, plans to stop in Beirut on his way
back to Damascus to discuss the negotiations with Lebanese
officials.

NEW ENGLAND LAWMAKERS BRAINSTORM ON BEST WAYS TO LOWER DRUG PRICES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. _ Legislative leaders and analysts from the four
northern New England states gathered here Thursday to plot joint
strategies for lowering the price of prescription drugs, from
imposing local price controls to pooling their residents to demand
a regional mass discount.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, the first of its kind, was largely a brainstorming
session, but participants said it could grow into a movement among
states to forge ahead where Congress had balked, and pass laws
forcing the pharmaceutical industry to cut prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress could solve this problem in four hours,'' said Peter
Shumlin, president pro tem of the Vermont Senate, ``but they're
choosing not to because pharmaceutical companies give them gobs of
money for their election campaigns. So we have a responsibility as
states to see what we can do while Congress is sitting on its
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The envoys from Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont
agreed to explore several avenues. They included price controls on
drugs at the state level _ bills to impose such controls are in the
works in Maine and Vermont _ and pooling residents into a sort of
big buying club to negotiate the kind of discount that, say, Canada
has. They also said they planned to invite Connecticut, New York,
Rhode Island and Quebec into the process.
</P>
<P>
   Many details _ in fact, virtually all the details _ remain to be
worked out about how the states can collaborate in challenging the
drug industry. But New England legislatures are known for
undertaking bold social experiments, and by meeting's end, there
was a consensus that the initiative was worth pursuing. The
attendees agreed to an interstate conference call next week and a
second, larger meeting soon after.
</P>
<P>
   Drug company representatives were not invited to the conference.
But the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the
industry's trade association, issued a statement saying that the
solution to the financial crunch that many Americans, especially
the elderly, face in paying for their medications lies not with
government controls but with Medicare reform and broadened
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Price controls ``tell private investors all around the world
that they can earn a higher return on their money if it's invested
in other industries,'' Judith H. Bello, the trade association's
executive vice president, said in a phone interview. Such controls
are bad for the momentum of pharmaceutical research, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for bulk-buying or pooling arrangements, Ms. Bello said, a
Maine commission had recently decided against bulk buying as too
cumbersome and costly, and a bulk-buying plan in the works in
Massachusetts is raising heated debate.
</P>
<P>
   The association also expressed skepticism about the possibility
that the New England states could create a ``pharmaceutical
compact'' much like the regional dairy compact that sets milk
prices. Such a compact, its statement said, ``could take years to
design and implement.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, though speakers at the meeting raised the idea of a
compact, no one appeared to have the patience at this point to
focus on such a politically complex solution: A compact would
require agreement among the states and congressional approval as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they shared some of the shorter-term measures that they
have been trying in their individual states. They heard about the
Massachusetts effort to create one big buyer pool out of 1.6
million residents, among them the uninsured and the poor, and
negotiate a mass discount. And about Maine's expansion of its
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   From New Hampshire came descriptions of a new discount drug
program for senior citizens. And from Vermont, members of a special
legislative committee on drug prices described how they were
pinning many of their hopes on their proximity to Canada, even
considering state-run, medication-buying bus trips across the
border.
</P>
<P>
   It was largely out of that committee's frustration that
Thursday's effort at forging a regional bloc to circumvent Congress
grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to be as creative as we could,'' said Jan Backus, the
state senator who headed the panel, ``but everything we came up
with, there was a block put in place by the drug industry lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   They found they were not allowed by law to re-import drugs from
Canada, where they are much cheaper, Ms. Backus said; they were
also barred from joining the steep group discount the federal
government gets, and could not buy through Indian tribes who share
that discount. They also could not, under federal law, impose price
controls on out-of-state manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere we looked, we found a dead end,'' she said. ``It was
very frustrating and very clear we had to come together to make a
political case to get change in Washington, as well as coming
together to bulk buy.''
</P>
<P>
   To these state lawmakers, Congress has succumbed to
pharmaceutical companies and left the state legislatures to find
ways to help citizens pay for drugs. Several bills meant to ease
the pain of high drug prices are in the works in Congress, but the
New England envoys appeared to hold out little hope of a federal
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Obuchowski, the speaker of the Vermont House of
Representatives, said baldly that ``Congress has been bought off by
the pharmaceutical industry.'' In contrast, he said, Thursday's
meeting, in a purple-curtained chamber of the venerable State
House, was ``almost like a clean room environment,'' like those
used in chip manufacturing or space science.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers also emphasized that they did not equate drug
companies with tobacco makers, whose products harm people. They
simply did not think Americans should pay significantly more than
people in other countries, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending the meeting took home a draft resolution
proclaiming that they would work together as a coalition to
coordinate the passage of model laws to cut drug prices, to enter
joint purchasing agreements and more.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting pleased Anthony Pollina, a senior policy adviser for
the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, which has been pushing
for price-control laws for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that this has happened, that leaders of
any group of states have come together to talk about prescription
drugs,'' Pollina said, ``and I think it shows how serious the
problem is, and how serious state policy leaders are about
providing the leadership Congress won't and taking on the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others predicted that other states would begin to band
together to lower drug prices. First, however, the New Englanders
must show that such a group approach is effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a long battle,'' Obuchowski of Vermont
said. ``It's going to be a hard battle, depending on what approach
is taken, and I hope we bring to that battle the resolve to see it
through to the end.''

 &HT;    Collins' arrest may seal fate in football career
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ The day he became an NFL player, Cecil Collins
declared that his past problems _ two arrests for breaking into
women's apartments, two dismissals from college football teams and
27 days in prison _ had changed him.
</P>
<P>
   He thanked ``the Lord and Jimmy Johnson'' for giving him another
chance. And he pledged to make the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is my last chance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At about 5:30 a.m. Thursday _ less than eight months after the
Miami Dolphins made Collins a fifth-round draft pick and gave him a
three-year, $860,000 contract _ the 23-year-old running back may
have blown that chance in an all-too-familiar manner.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was arrested and charged with burglary of an occupied
dwelling after neighbors said he broke into their apartment as they
slept. Collins, free on $10,000 bond, was suspended by the
Dolphins. In addition, the new charges could lead authorities in
Louisiana to revoke his probation and force him to serve a
five-year suspended sentence on similar charges.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald and Tina Nolte, a couple living in Collins' apartment
complex, told Davie police that Collins had been stalking Tina
Nolte for two months. They said early Thursday that Collins forced
open a window in a spare bedroom of their apartment, then opened
the door to their master bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:38 a.m., as her husband chased Collins, Tina Nolte called
police. At 6:30 a.m., Collins was arrested in his own apartment. As
police continue to investigate what happened, Lt. Gary Killam said
there is the possibility Collins could face more charges, perhaps
including stalking.
</P>
<P>
   After Collins was interviewed by detectives, transferred to the
Broward County Jail and released on bond, he hopped in a Cadillac
sport utility vehicle driven by his pregnant girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just made a mistake; that's all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate repercussions: Johnson, the Dolphins' coach,
indefinitely suspended Collins, but hasn't decided if it's with or
without pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know all the details yet, and I hope these
allegations aren't true,'' Johnson said in a statement. ``However,
he will be suspended until we find out more information about it. I
want to make it clear that the Miami Dolphin organization does not
condone the behavior that was reported to us, but since we are
still in the process of gathering additional information, it would
be premature to speculate on what further action might be taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Just one day earlier, when asked about his reputation for
signing players with troubled pasts, Johnson had said: ``Yes, we do
give players second chances, but once they are with us, if they get
out of line in the least little way we're going to go ahead and ...
go a different direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision of where Collins goes from here could be out of the
hands of Johnson and the NFL. Not only do Thursday's charges carry
a potential 15-year jail penalty, but even if he were to plea
bargain to lesser charges, he would be in violation of his
probation in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he was kicked off the Louisiana State team after being
arrested and charged with breaking into an apartment and fondling a
17-year-old woman. Less than a month later, he was arrested again,
this time charged with breaking into an apartment and touching an
18-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor
counts of simple battery and two felony counts of unauthorized
entry of an inhabited dwelling. He was put on four-year probation
and ordered to perform 300 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Bernie, the prosecuting attorney in the case in Baton Rouge,
said Thursday that if Collins is involved in ``any criminal
activity'' whatsoever _ the severity doesn't matter _ he is subject
to serving his suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm terribly disappointed that he was not able to stay out of
trouble,'' Bernie said. ``He had an opportunity to put his criminal
activity behind him and apparently he was unable to. And now he has
hurt a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest victims, according to police, live near Collins, his
girlfriend and 3-year-old daughter in the gated apartment complex a
few miles northeast of the Dolphins' training facility.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lewis, an attorney and friend of the Noltes, said Thursday
that a couple of months ago, Collins became infatuated with Tina
Nolte, who turns 28 today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept asking her out,'' Lewis said. ``He saw her in the gym
and kept hitting on her. He followed her home on one occasion. She
had expressed concern to her husband and they had toyed with the
idea of getting a restraining order.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the Noltes hoped Collins would stop harassing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then this happened,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the Noltes told police happened Thursday: They
awoke to the sound of someone opening the door to their master
bedroom. Ronald Nolte jumped out of bed and chased Collins. Collins
ran through the apartment and dove out the same window in a spare
bedroom that he had entered, landed on wet grass and fled.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Nolte told police he ran out of the apartment and chased
down Collins on the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to what I was told, the victim basically said, `Hey,
what are you doing in my house?''' Killam said. ``And (Collins)
said, `It wasn't me, man. I wasn't in your house.'''
</P>
<P>
   When police arrived, the Noltes identified Collins by name and
described his clothing. Police took fingerprints from near the
window and sent them to the crime lab.
</P>
<P>
   No weapons were involved. Collins was not tested for alcohol or
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is still under investigation,'' Killam said.
``This is going to take some time.''

 JURY SIDES WITH FORMER N.Y. GIANT IN JOB LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A jury in Newark, N.J., awarded more than $10 million Thursday
to Philip McConkey, the former New York Giants football player,
after finding that Frank Zarb, the chairman of the group that runs
the Nasdaq stock market, deceived McConkey into working for him at
a previous concern.
</P>
<P>
   McConkey had sued Zarb and Alexander &AMP; Alexander Services Inc.,
the insurance brokerage firm that Zarb formerly ran, contending
that he would not have gone to work for the firm in May 1996 if
Zarb had not assured him that it was not for sale. Seven months
after meeting with McConkey, Zarb announced plans to sell Alexander
&AMP; Alexander to Aon Corp. for $1.23 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The six-person jury, in the Superior Court of New Jersey,
unanimously found that Zarb fraudulently misled McConkey about the
status of talks between the companies. The jury awarded slightly
more than $5 million to McConkey to compensate him for his losses,
including $2 million for emotional distress, and $5 million in
punitive damages. If that award stands up to challenges and
appeals, Aon will be liable for all of it. Some of the award might
have come out of Zarb's pocket, but, in an unusual move, McConkey
quietly dropped Zarb as a defendant at the beginning of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for the
National Association of Securities Dealers said: ``We're
disappointed. At no time was McConkey misled.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis Carr, an Aon lawyer who also represented Zarb while he was
a defendant, said he had asked Judge Kenneth Stein to throw out the
jury's decision because it did not fit with the facts. If he does
not, Carr said, Aon will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Although McConkey may not receive the award for a long time, if
at all, he said after the trial, ``I'm very much relieved and
pleased that the jury was able to look at the evidence and focus
through the haze and come up with the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes at a bad time for Zarb, who is trying to
convert the Nasdaq market into a private company. He has been
traveling around to meet with the brokerage firms he represents to
persuade them to allow him to sell stakes in Nasdaq to a select
group of corporations and brokerage firms. Some smaller members of
the association have complained that Zarb does not plan to let them
vote on his plan.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-week trial, McConkey's lawyer, Neil Mullin,
repeatedly pointed to a document signed by Zarb and filed with the
federal government that appeared to contradict what Zarb had told
McConkey. A proxy statement that Alexander &AMP; Alexander filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission said that ``from January to
May of 1996'' Zarb and Patrick Ryan, the chairman of Aon, discussed
``a possible business combination,'' including an outright purchase
by Aon. But Zarb testified that he thought those talks ``were
dead'' when he met with McConkey in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   McConkey testified that, before he joined Alexander &AMP; Alexander
from another insurance brokerage, he had asked Zarb about rumors
that Aon might buy the firm. In a brief meeting in Zarb's office,
McConkey said, Zarb told him that Alexander &AMP; Alexander was ``the
predator, not the prey.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the acquisition, Aon laid off McConkey, who has not
worked in the insurance business since then. Zarb testified that he
received $23 million in severance when he resigned as chairman and
chief executive of Alexander &AMP; Alexander in early 1997. He left to
become president of the NASD and is now its chairman.

BUCHANAN, IN A CHANGE, CALLS FOR END TO SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Conceding ``a dramatic departure from what I've
argued and believed,'' on Thursday Pat Buchanan called for an end
to economic sanctions by the White House as a ``sword that
slaughters children'' and entrenches dictators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sanctions are sowing seeds of hatred that will one day
flower in acts of terrorism against us,'' Buchanan said in a speech
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who is courting independent voters and the Reform
Party for its nomination for president, said his decision to oppose
sanctions grew out of recent reporting on the effects of sanctions
in aggravating the health and nutrition problems of rogue nations
like Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Arab terrorists murder Israeli children,'' Buchanan said,
``we Americans are rightly filled with horror and disgust. But what
do Arab peoples think of us when U.S. sanctions bring death to
literally thousands of Iraqi children every month?''
</P>
<P>
   A supporter of sanctions in the past against Cuba, Buchanan said
conditions had changed with the fall of Soviet communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the siege mentality our embargo has created inside
Cuba,'' he said, ``our sanctions may today be the main pillar of
Castro's power.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions, he continued, ``may fairly be called America's silent
weapon of mass destruction whose victims are almost always the
weak, the sick, the women and the young.''
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Buchanan cited what he called counterproductive
sanctions by the Clinton administration in a dozen countries,
including Iran, Libya, Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, India, Pakistan
and Yugoslavia. He vowed that as president he would end all
sanctions depriving food, medicine and other basic necessities to
the suffering subjects of rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Embargoes and blockades are weapons of war,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   They must be designed, he continued, ``so that innocent people
are not the principal casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Yugoslavia, Buchanan criticized the administration
for first ``smashing'' the country with a 78-day bombing campaign,
and then denying Serbs heating oil and aid in removing the debris
of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This immoral policy shames us as a people,'' Buchanan said.
``We are putting old men, women, and children under a sentence of
death for failing to do what NATO itself could not do: overthrow
Slobodan Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Dictatorial governments do not justify sanctions, Buchanan said,
adding, ``No one has deputized America to play Wyatt Earp to the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   He denounced ``all this Beltway braying'' about the United
States being the world's indispensable super power. ``Have we, too,
succumbed to the hubris of hegemony?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   There are better ways to punish rogue states, Buchanan said,
including cutting off overseas assets of dictators, denying them
international loans and levying tariffs to deny them hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing President Clinton of ``monumental hypocrisy'' in
applying sanctions, Buchanan said, ``He blockaded, starved and
invaded tiny Haiti for human rights violations, but he proudly
chaperones China into the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when answering questions about his presidential campaign,
Buchanan exulted that he was not caught up in the primary campaigns
in Iowa and New Hampshire but was instead visiting Reform Party
gatherings around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen no organized opposition,'' he said. ``We are
winning delegates quietly, and we are moving on this nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he had always known he would be working at the
complex Reform nomination process with little public notice. His
aim is to ``surface'' again in March, when, he said, the two major
party candidates will be clear and the public will begin to be
anxious at the choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``People,'' he said, ``are going to look out and say, `Oh, my
Lord, that troll is still out there under the bridge.'''

 PETER G. La HAYESr., DEVELOPER OF SIGHT-IMPROVEMENT DEVICES, DIES By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter G. La Haye Sr., a leader in developing technologies to
help people see better, died Sunday when his private plane crashed
in Pennsylvania on its way to New Jersey from Seattle. La Haye was
59 and lived in Medina, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   La Haye was on his way to a board meeting in New York of Orbis
International, a charity group that promotes eye health in
developing nations, a spokesman for La Haye said Thursday. The
cause of the crash, which also killed the two pilots on board, is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Montreal, La Haye dropped out of high school but went on
to help pioneer the development of plastic lenses for people
suffering from cataract diseases, to develop dietary supplements
for people with eye diseases and to develop stick-on magnifying
lenses for sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   La Haye's ventures made him wealthy. Earlier this year, he
attracted national media attention when he put his waterfront
estate _ a quarter-mile from that of William H. Gates, the chairman
of Microsoft _ up for sale for $45 million, one of the highest
prices asked for a home in the United States. The property remains
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   But La Haye's roots were more humble. After leaving high school
and serving briefly in the Marine Corps, La Haye moved to Los
Angeles in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   While working in a gas station, La Haye lobbied hard for a job
at Bell &AMP; Howell, the optical and information technology company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got so tired of seeing me, they hired me,'' La Haye told
The Puget Sound Business Journal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of jobs, including a position as a production
manager at Xerox, La Haye struck out on his own in the early 1970s,
and in 1973 began developing lenses to be implanted in cataract
patients. By the late 1970s, his company, Iolab, controlled almost
50 percent of the global market for such lenses and La Haye sold
the company to Johnson &AMP; Johnson in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for La Haye declined to comment on the value of that
deal.
</P>
<P>
   After selling Iolab, La Haye retired from business and moved
from California to Washington, where he could park his boat in
front of his house. But in 1986, prompted largely by tales from
missionaries who had worked with cataract patients in Ethiopia and
Pakistan, he founded La Haye Laboratories. The laboratories have
developed anti-oxidant supplements for people with degenerative eye
diseases under the slogan ``Promotes Healthy Eyes.'' That product
line was sold to an affiliate of Nestle SA last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, La Haye founded another company, Neoptx, which makes
removable reading lenses for sunglasses and diving masks.
</P>
<P>
   La Haye is survived by his mother, Martha Sonois, of Sherbrooke,
Quebec; his wife, Sandy; three brothers, Paul, of Kennebunk, Me.;
Bernard, of Montreal; and Richard, of St. Bruno, Quebec; a sister,
Monique Deroches, of Sherbrooke; two sons, Peter Jr., and Derrick,
both of the Seattle area; one daughter, Kristine La Haye Wood, of
the Seattle area; and seven grandchildren.

MANNESMANN MAY CONSIDER A DEAL FORTIFIED WITH CASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Mannesmann AG of Germany may be willing to consider a
friendly takeover deal from Vodafone AirTouch PLC if the British
mobile phone giant adds a cash sweetener to its hostile all-stock
offer, executives close to Mannesmann said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The executives also said that Mannesmann management now seems to
be divided over whether a friendly resolution can be achieved if
Vodafone adds cash to its offer.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the stance of Mannesmann, the telecommunications and
engineering conglomerate, has been that it is not for sale and that
any negotiations will prove futile.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, the world's largest mobile phone company, offered
stock worth $127.7 billion for Mannesmann on Nov. 19, the biggest
hostile-takeover attempt ever. The share values of both companies
have risen since then, and the offer is now worth more than $148
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The British company has said that it will make a formal takeover
offer to Mannesmann shareholders by Dec. 24. Both companies have
been aggressively lobbying with shareholders for support in a
struggle that could alter the landscape of European
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Mannesmann said that under the current terms
of Vodafone's offer, the German company will press ahead with its
defense plans. They emphasized that despite the views of a faction
of Mannesmann management that favor considering an offer including
a cash component, they do not expect Vodafone to make another
overture. And they declined to estimate how much cash this faction
would want.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone has said it will pay Mannesmann stockholders 53.7 of
its shares for each Mannesmann share.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Esser, chief executive of Mannesmann, is philosophically
opposed to any offer, with or without cash, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Esser has previously stated that Mannesmann is worth at least 33
percent more than Vodafone is currently offering.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mannesmann declined to comment on possible
dissension among the company's management. Vodafone also declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But executives close to Vodafone said the British company was
still willing to negotiate with Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone is expected to make its formal offer under German
takeover codes, which are more lenient and allow for Vodafone to
raise its offer, unlike British takeover regulations, which
effectively bind bidders to their original offer.
</P>
<P>
   Once Vodafone has made its offer, it can keep that proposal on
the table for 28 to 60 days. The executives close to Vodafone
suggested that the company would leave its offer open until
sometime in February.
</P>
<P>
   While Christopher Gent, chief executive of Vodafone, has
repeatedly said that his company's offer is final, making the offer
under German regulations allows for the possibility that
negotiations between the two telecommunications companies could
take place.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone has repeatedly sought to portray its offer as friendly,
though Mannesmann has rebuffed all the overtures. Esser insists
that Mannesmann's business strategy is completely different from
Vodafone's and that a tie-up of the two companies would lead to
slower growth than if Mannesmann remains independent.
</P>
<P>
   In presentations to investors, Esser has said that his company's
growth is based on a combination of communications methods
including land-line networks, data networks and wireless networks,
while Vodafone's strategy is to stick to its wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Esser said, ``It is difficult to see potential in
further talks.'' He added, ``There is no strategic incentive for
Mannesmann to combine with Vodafone.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, though, said a sweetened cash offer could make a deal
more palatable to investors who are nervous that an all-stock deal
carries too much volatility. Most analysts interviewed thought that
it was too soon to declare a winner and that investors will
generally wait to see Vodafone's formal offering documents and
Mannesmann's formal response before making up their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone shares rose 2.4 percent Thursday to 3.0625 pounds, or
$4.93. Mannesmann shares edged up 2 euros to 225.50 euros, or
$229.24. The shares of both companies had been largely unchanged
most of the week, having risen considerably since Vodafone first
announced its hostile bid.

ABBOTT LABS ABANDONS PURCHASE OF ALZA CORP. 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing its string of recent public misfortunes, Abbott
Laboratories Inc. said Thursday that it was abandoning its $7.3
billion acquisition of Alza Corp. because of antitrust opposition
from the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, the nation's largest maker of medical diagnostic
devices, had announced in June that it would buy Alza, a leading
developer of drug delivery technologies, but soon encountered a
series of troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts became convinced that the acquisition was imperiled
when the companies said in September that they would sell Viadur,
one of Alza's experimental treatments for prostate cancer, to
satisfy antitrust concerns from the FTC. Abbott sells Lupron, a
leading prostate cancer drug.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a month later, Abbott agreed to pay a $100 million fine _
the largest penalty ever levied by the Food and Drug Administration
_ to settle complaints that the company had failed to meet quality
standards in manufacturing some of its medical test kits.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ernest Mario, Alza's chief executive, said Thursday that he
was concerned about the fine, but insisted that the deal had fallen
apart over the two companies' disagreement with the FTC, not the
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, the FTC was concerned about what they
called the monopoly Abbott had in prostate cancer treatments,''
Mario said. ``We thought we had done enough by offering to sell
Viadur, but we could never come to terms with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that the deal had been scrapped came after the
market closed, and investors reacted aggressively in after-hours
trading. Shares of Abbott, which had risen $1.125, to $36.3125,
climbed as high as $39.50. Alza, which closed at $36.4375, down
$3.1875, plunged an additional 23.8 percent after hours, to $27.75.
Mario attributed the drop to arbitragers, who, he estimated, held
about 40 million of Alza's 102 million outstanding shares.

COMPROMISE GROWTH PLAN NEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time for a new slogan:
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix _ the city you can't wait to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Or:
</P>
<P>
   ``Come to the Valley and discover why bigger isn't better.''
</P>
<P>
   Or:
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow your dreams to Phoenix, then wake up and get out.''
</P>
<P>
   A case could be made for any of those lines in light of the
response to this survey question: ``If you were able to move out of
the greater Phoenix area tomorrow, would you do it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' replied 45 percent of the 1,020 residents. It was the
finest display of community loyalty since the Colts fled Baltimore
in the middle of the night in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Even though The Arizona Republic survey was taken in September,
when the infernal heat has worn us down, the result is noteworthy.
So is the fact that the No. 1 reason given for wanting to move away
was ``too many people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a demonstration of discontent with growth, and it holds
up across all the demographics of age, gender, income, race and
ethnicity,'' said Ryan Johnson of the Morrison Institute for Public
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Woods, the former attorney general and leader of the
Sierra Club-sponsored initiative to slow growth, put it more
bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When 45 percent of the people say they're ready to move,
something's seriously wrong. That survey shows that people here
have finally hit the wall and want significant change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I don't disagree, but the poll may not reflect quite as
negatively on the Phoenix area's growth as Woods suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has more than its share of restless souls with roots
elsewhere. They're not unhappy here, but they're also not deeply
committed.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie and Stephanie Schmitgen are examples. They grew up in
rural Minnesota and moved to Tempe in 1992. He earned a master's
degree at Arizona State University and has a good job with the city
of Phoenix. They like it here but are moving next month to
Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mostly to be closer to our families,'' he said. ``We have
a 13-month-old daughter, and both sets of grandparents will be
nearby. We miss the seasons a little bit, too. The Valley's growth
really isn't the reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said the Citizens Growth Management Initiative already has
about 90,000 of the 101,762 signatures needed by July to put it on
the ballot next November. One provision would require cities, towns
and counties to impose growth boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom says voters will approve the initiative if
they aren't satisfied with a milder plan called Growing Smarter,
supported by Gov. Jane Hull and most of the business community.
That plan awaits legislative action this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Pfister, head of the Growing Smarter Commission, calls the
Sierra Club plan too extreme and filled with ``booby traps'' meant
to subvert growth. He said it would also lead to a welter of
lawsuits by activists, create much higher densities and risk
throwing the local economy into recession.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise may be in the works. Supporters of the two plans
have been meeting privately to see if they can reach agreement on
what could be a third alternative.
</P>
<P>
   One person trying to bridge the differences is Eddie Basha, the
grocery store owner and 1994 Democratic candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   He said Chandler, where he lives and his company is based, ``has
sold out to developers and landowners.'' He regards Growing Smarter
as too weak a remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an expansion-minded capitalist who believes in growth, but
it has to be balanced,'' he said. ``I think Grant Woods is being
reasonable and wants to find a compromise. If a decent one can't be
forged, I'll join his side.''
</P>
<P>
   Basha's on the right track. A hybrid growth control plan should
be developed. If the quality-of-life survey isn't the last word,
it's clear enough. People want to put the brakes on growth, and
they want to hit them hard. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Could it be? Could Broadway, an industry that is
practically synonymous with safe, staid entertainment, where
revivals rule and new plays founder, actually be getting a little
quirky?
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of offbeat theatrical thinking was everywhere this
week, from the casting of a queen of independent film to the
arrival of the so-called squonkers. While it's hardly time to label
it a renaissance, all of it may make the spring more interesting
than the current schedule suggests.
</P>
<P>
   First off is word of one of the most unlikely leaps to Broadway
in recent memory. Beginning on Feb. 8 at the Helen Hayes Theater
are performances of ``Squonk,'' the eccentric downtown hit
developed by a quintet from Pittsburgh. ``Epic Proportions,'' the
Hayes' current tenant, closes on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A Broadway address for ``Squonk'' comes as a major surprise.
After completing a successful if brief run last August at Public
School 122 (that would be Off Off Broadway) the show initially
seemed headed for a run at the Salon, a 250-seat space in NoHo. But
that deal fell through, and just around the time the Hayes was
looking for new tenants. ``It was the luck of fate,'' said William
Repicci, the lead producer.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, subtitled ``BigSmorgasbordWunderWerk,'' is not easily
defined. Roughly put, ``Squonk'' is a 80-minute musical melange
incorporating bits of everything from German Expressionism to
Japanese Noh theater. There's dance, and big props. And it's
apparently funny. And slightly trippy. Reviewing the show in The
New York Times, Ben Brantley called ``Squonk'' a ``charmingly
thought-free diversion'' whose overall effect he likened to ``a
hallucinatory game.''
</P>
<P>
   How this will play uptown is an open question. Off Broadway has
supported a variety of plotless but intriguing entertainments,
including ``Stomp,'' ``Blue Man Group,'' and ``De La Guarda,'' all
of which have benefited from sizable tourist and
non-English-speaking audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Cult status downtown, of course, does not guarantee success on
Broadway, where the current idea of bold experimentation seems to
be casting Susan Lucci as Annie Oakley. Still, Repicci says he
feels that this is the moment. ``I just thought maybe it was time
for this genre of show to break into Broadway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   TALKING EGGHEADS IN `COPENHAGEN'
</P>
<P>
   In other quarters, there were details about another
unconventional play heading to Broadway. It is ``Copenhagen,''
Michael Frayn's complex meditation on physics, memory and bodies in
motion, in this case two geniuses: the German physicist Werner
Heisenberg and the Danish physicist Niels Bohr.
</P>
<P>
   The play, directed by Michael Blakemore, is to open on April 11
at a Shubert theater yet to be named. Philip Bosco has been cast as
Bohr, Michael Cumpsty as Heisenberg, and Blair Brown, currently in
``The Dead,'' as Margrethe, Bohr's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copenhagen'' was a surprise hit in London, where it won the
Evening Standard Award for best play in 1998. Still, Blakemore
said, it is a risky thing to do on Broadway. ``It's a very unusual
play,'' he said. ``Copenhagen'' seems likely to be a strong Tony
contender in a season of few standout new plays. Blakemore is also
enjoying the status of the hottest director on Broadway, with his
hit revival of ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' and his productions of
``Copenhagen'' on the West End and in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   How does he think the American production will play?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a little juicier, Blakemore said: American actors ``are
emotionally a little more accessible than British ones.''
</P>
<P>
   INDIE STAR SIGNS ON
</P>
<P>
   Titles seem to stick to Parker Posey. She has been variously
described as ``the queen of Sundance Film Festival,'' the ``high
mistress of independent film'' and the ``doyenne of downtown
comediennes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now add Broadway babe to the list. The twinkly gamine from
Laurel, Miss., will make her New York theater debut in ``Taller
Than a Dwarf,'' the Elaine May play that opens at the Longacre
Theater in April.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Posey has signed on to play Selma, an unhappy typist,
opposite Matthew Broderick in the comedy, about a modern couple at
war in a ramshackle Manhattan apartment. She said her decision was
part art, part fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reading the script on the plane, and in the play, Selma
is having bathroom trouble,'' Ms. Posey said, with just a hint of
Southern drawl. ``So I come home to my apartment, and water comes
out of my medicine cabinet. It was a sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Posey, 31, is best known for her memorable turns in
low-budget, highly praised movies like ``Party Girl,'' ``The
Daytrippers'' and ``Dazed and Confused.'' But her career has also
included a run in John Patrick Shanley's play ``Four Dogs and a
Bone'' at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles and conservatory
training at the State University of New York at Purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having earned herself a name _ or two _ she's back to the
stage. ``I'm thankful,'' she said. ``It's pretty hard to get plays
unless you're well known.'' SISTER ACT
</P>
<P>
   Auditions were under way this week for a musical adaptation of
``Little Women,'' which producers say is Broadway-bound. Like its
many film predecessors, the musical is based on Louisa May Alcott's
novel about good girls' coming of age in wartime New England (the
Civil War, that is). The project is led by Randall Wreghitt and the
first-time producers Dani Davis, a former actress, and Jason
Howland, a musical supervisor for the composer Frank Wildhorn. Ms.
Davis said the production would have a workshop in the spring, a
summer tour and an autumn opening on Broadway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   The cast is set for ``Arms and the Man,'' to be presented by the
Roundabout Theater Co. in February. Katie Finneran, Henry Czerny
and Paul Michael Valley will star.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Broadway may be taking New Year's Eve off, but not
Dame Edna. In her third month at the Booth Theater, she will be the
host of the BBC's New Year's television broadcast. Let's hope the
Queen is asleep.

FAILED SUPERCOMPUTER CHIPS RETURN IN CONSUMER GUISES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Mass.)   (rk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A microprocessor that failed commercially when
it was introduced for supercomputers in the 1980s is about to find
new life in home entertainment and other consumer devices of the
next decade, many of which will require more raw computing power
than the most powerful machines from a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard and STMicroelectronics, Europe's second-largest
maker of computer chips, plan to announce on Monday that they are
forming a research and development partnership to adapt the old
design to a new generation of home products.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, known as VLIW, for ``very long instruction
word,'' was pioneered by computer designers at Yale University in
the early 1980s. It was commercialized in the mid-80s by Multiflow,
a Connecticut company that made supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   Like a scheme to increase traffic flow by packing cars
bumper-to-bumper in high-speed freeway lanes, VLIW uses a special
``compiler'' that packs the computer's instructions densely so that
processing takes place more efficiently. Compilers are the software
that translates a programmer's written code into the binary
language of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently some VLIW concepts found their way into the IA64
microprocessor being jointly developed by Hewlett and Intel. Intel
is planning to begin producing the first IA64 chip, named Itanium,
in the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Both Intel and Hewlett-Packard were silent investors in
Multiflow. Joseph A. Fisher, a former Yale computer scientist who
co-founded Multiflow, joined Hewlett-Packard in 1990, establishing
a small research group in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Other computer makers, including Sun Microsystems and Texas
Instruments, have also recently turned to VLIW designs in
microprocessors and microcontrollers found in thousands of consumer
products, ranging from automobiles to washing machines.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, consumer video and audio entertainment products
require processing speeds once found only in supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   In such applications, where the processing tasks are relatively
repetitive, compared with the work performed by general purpose
computers, VLIW frequently has huge cost and power advantages.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it fits well with the kinds of computing power
demanded by modern printers, which must scale or transform the
colors of an image that consists of millions of pixels.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be proven, however, is whether VLIW designs will become
the dominant technology for general-purpose applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot of debate about whether the IA64 is
really the right technology,'' said Linley Gwennap, editorial
director of Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. But he
also acknowledged that in some applications, like printers, VLIW
``makes a lot of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Hewlett-Packard, a leading maker of computer
printers, and STMicroelectronics say the VLIW approach has broad
applications in low-power devices like wireless phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will open up new portable applications that have not been
possible before,'' said Loic Lietar, corporate strategic marketing
manager at an STMicroelectronics manufacturing plant in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   STMicroelectronics, formerly SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, is
the second largest European semiconductor maker behind Philips, and
is the 9th-largest in the world. The company is a leading maker of
components for the cellular phone industry and analog
semiconductors. STMicroelectronics already makes components for
print heads for Hewlett-Packard's ink-jet printers.
</P>
<P>
   The research deal, which is expected to lead to products next
year, is a measure of vindication for Fisher, who has quietly
continued to work with VLIW technology in his small Cambridge
laboratory since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview Thursday that at times he had felt
depressed about the prospects of VLIW while waiting for hardware
technology to grow in sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he said, ``There are many uses for embedded processors
that require powerful computing capabilities.''

CHANGE OF TRIAL'S LOCALE CAN MAKE DIFFERENCE IN VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-DIALLO-TRIAL, NY-DIALLO-REACT)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For police officers facing brutality charges, moving
a trial to a new location can mean the difference between
conviction and acquittal, legal experts say. There is no more
powerful example than the case of the Los Angeles police officers
who beat Rodney King, a black man, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Although the incident occurred in Los Angeles, lawyers for the
four officers, citing pretrial publicity, persuaded a judge to move
the trial to Simi Valley, a largely white area in neighboring
Ventura County. The officers were acquitted in 1992 by a jury that
had no black members, leading to rioting that roiled Los Angeles
for days. In 1993, the officers were tried on federal civil rights
charges. Two were convicted and two were acquitted by a 12-person
Los Angeles jury that included two African-Americans and one
Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Pretrial publicity was the main reason cited Thursday by a New
York appeals court for moving the trial of four New York City
police officers to upstate Albany. The four officers are accused of
killing Amadou Diallo on Feb. 4 as he stood near the entrance of
his apartment building in the Bronx. Comparisons between Simi
Valley and Albany seem unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Requests by defense lawyers to move cases are not unusual, but
courts rarely grant them; on Thursday, the appeals court called the
move ``an extraordinary remedy reserved for the rarest of cases.''
Lawyers usually argue that the move is necessary because pretrial
publicity has tainted the local jury pool, but judges often rule
that such fears are exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for John Wayne Gacy, who was convicted of murdering 33
boys and young men in the Chicago area two decades ago, argued for
moving the trial, known legally as a change of venue, because of
publicity, but Judge Louis Garippo of the Cook County Circuit Court
rejected that argument. He did, however, order that a jury be
selected in another county and brought to Chicago, because of the
large number of victims and the possibility that potential jurors
in Chicago would have known them or their families.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of high-profile cases in the New York area have been
moved in recent years because of concerns over pretrial publicity,
including the 1986 federal trial of Stanley Friedman, the Bronx
Democratic leader, which involved charges of corruption in the New
York City Parking Violations Bureau. That trial was moved to New
Haven, Conn., after an agreement between defense lawyers and
Rudolph Giuliani, then a U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Giuliani, now the mayor, said, ``You should
basically resolve these things in favor of the defendant's getting
every opportunity to have a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, trials for a number of defendants accused in
an armored car robbery in Rockland County that left three dead were
moved to Orange County and to White Plains, in Westchester County,
because of publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Only in rare instances, like the case in Los Angeles, is there
perceived to be a deeply felt public sentiment against the
defendants. And some legal experts believe that public sentiment
about a defendant or a particular crime should not necessarily
disqualify a community from meting out justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defendants are using these venue motions as a way of avoiding
the evaluation of their conduct by the community where the crime
was committed,'' said Drew Kershen, a law professor at the
University of Oklahoma. The trial of Timothy McVeigh on murder
charges stemming from the bombing of the federal building in
Oklahoma City was a case in point, Kershen said. It was moved to
Denver largely because of the presumed prejudice of the people of
Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of confidence that people in the districts
affected can make these decisions, and they're the ones who ought
to,'' he said. The Simi Valley jurors, he said, had no stake in
what happened in Los Angeles. ``The defendant should not have to
face a howling mob, but until you prove that to me, I don't think
you ought to let defendants get away from facing possible
condemnation. It's not about letting defendants pick a place where
they can win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The moving of trials far from the location of a crime surfaced
as an issue in American law during colonial times, when people
accused of crimes were often transported to England for trials.
Colonists objected, saying local juries were in a better position
to evaluate their actions than juries in London. That sentiment was
written as a defendant's right into the Sixth Amendment to the
Constitution, which guarantees ``a public trial by an impartial
jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, the New York officers are likely to find a more
sympathetic jury pool. ``I don't think I could pick a better spot
than Albany to present a case like that,'' said Terence Klindon, a
trial lawyer in Albany.

TRIBAL BUDGET SOARS TO $68 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL SOWERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with an uproar among tribal members who say they aren't
getting their fair share, the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Com
munity unveiled its annual budget, $68 million, a $25 million
increase since the tribe opened its two casinos 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal leaders handed out copies of tribal finances for the
first time during a volatile debate &UR; over a proposal to give members
a cut of the profit from the tribe's two casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hasn't happened in the past, and we want to make it an
annual presentation,'' Tribal Presi dent Ivan Makil told an
overflow crowd of more than 600 at a council meeting that ran five
hours Wednes day night.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Indian tribes aren't re quired to and have
traditionally not released tribal financial information.
</P>
<P>
   The budget was made public as a strategy to convince community
members that revenue from tribal business and the Casino Arizona
gambling halls is needed to improve an array of services on the
55,000-acre reservation, which borders Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past several months, about 1,000 tribal members have
signed petitions demanding that the tribe's 6,200 members split a
25 per cent share of the profits. The casinos opened in October
1998 and last March.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Ray, a tribal member, agreed with others that the budget
presentation lacked details because it is not clear how the tribe
arrived at the $68 million figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just picking those numbers out of the air,'' he said
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Garnet Gates, a former Tribal Council member who directed the
petition drive, called the budget presentation a ``dog and pony
show'' because it did not divulge casino profits.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, a member of a committee considering whether the profits
should be shared, said unless his panel gets the profit
information, it won't know how to divide the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Makil told the sometimes jeering crowd Wednesday that the
council will not divulge casino profits because the information
could be used by competing Indian casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also point to Indian gaming to justify reducing govern
ment aid to gaming tribes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make those profits public, I guarantee you they would
be in the newspaper the next day and you would be negatively im
pacted,'' Makil told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Makil struggled to keep order as the audience cheered a demand
that each tribal council member take a stand on the payout plan.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the nine council mem bers, including Makil, said the 25
percent payout formula would take too much of the money needed for
community improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe predicts it will need $425 million over the next
decade for public safety, a new detention center, fire protection,
recreation, education and housing. None of those projects has been
funded, and tribal officials want to keep the money for those
needs.
</P>
<P>
   But he said per capita payments haven't been ruled out.  &QL;

 EDITORIAL: THE McCAIN-BRADLEY SHOW  
(sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 17:
</P>
<P>
   The air and even some of the questions in New Hampshire were
frosty on Thursday at the unusual joint appearance of Sen. John
McCain of Arizona and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey. But
these two presidential candidates were making a significant
contribution with their attempt to give the issue of campaign
finance reform a more prominent place on the agenda for 2000. This
marked the first time that two serious contenders from opposing
parties have come together to challenge the Washington
establishment on so fundamental a problem as the two parties' joint
dependence on special-interest money.
</P>
<P>
   It was especially fitting that McCain and Bradley made their
appearance, broadcast on ABC's ``Nightline'' on Thursday night, at
the exact spot where President Clinton and former House Speaker
Newt Gingrich promised to bring about a bipartisan campaign cleanup
in 1995. Nothing came of that meeting except for mounting popular
disenchantment as detail after detail of the corrupt election of
1996 came to light. It is still fashionable in Washington to think
that campaign finance reform is a low priority among voters, as Ted
Koppel said repeatedly. But in fact, the issue has propelled both
McCain and Bradley in New Hampshire, where they are surging ahead
because they have made it a centerpiece of their respective
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, McCain and Bradley exchanged promises to bar their
parties from spending the unlimited contributions by corporations,
unions and rich individuals known as ``soft money'' should they
face one another in the general election. These donations to the
party circumvent longtime limits on campaign donations to the
candidates enacted by Congress over many decades, and McCain said
he would forgo soft money no matter whom he faces. Vice President
Al Gore has also pledged to forgo soft money in a general election
if his opponent does. But McCain and Bradley have been most
aggressive in promoting a move that would cut off an expected $500
million in party donations from the nation's most powerful special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, Thursday's joint appearance by McCain and Bradley
drew an irate response from George W. Bush. Early in the campaign
the Texas governor said he would favor a ban on soft-money
donations to political parties by corporations and unions. Lately
he has retreated, saying that such a ban would be effective only if
it were attached to a harshly anti-labor provision making it
difficult for unions to raise campaign money from their members.
His position is a dodge, since corporations already give more to
campaigns than unions do, by a ratio of more than 10 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   It took some nerve for McCain to attack his party's front-runner
on this issue. Bush has rejected fund-raising limits and is rapidly
becoming the champion money harvester of all time, even compared
with Bill Clinton. By defending soft money, Bush, a self-styled
outsider, has truly become the advocate of the Washington
fund-raising establishment in this election.
</P>
<P>
   In hard political terms, Bradley and McCain were competing on
Thursday for the independents and crossover voters that both of
them need in New Hampshire's open primary. But their meeting has
the potential of expanding the base of voters who understand the
corrupting influence of special-interest money. They should take
their show on the road and invite other candidates to join them. &QL;

FIESTA BOWL OFFERS FUNDS FOR STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Tostitos Fiesta Bowl is will ing to help finance a new
Phoenix areafootball stadium, but the amount it commits depends on
the kind of deal assembled in the coming months, the bowl's
executive director said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   John Junker told Gov. Jane Hull's stadium task force that his
organiza tion ``has a major stake in this issue, as does the state
of Arizona,'' because a new stadium could deter mine whether the
Fiesta Bowl remains in the rotation for the national college
football champion ship game.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the task force accepted proposals on proposed
stadium sites in Tempe and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe Mayor Neil Giuliano and Mesa Mayor Wayne Brown offered
four sites for consideration in north Tempe and along the
Tempe-Mesa line. The Downtown Phoenix Part nership and Phoenix City
Council man Cody Williams proposed one site apiece in central
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Ferris, Hull's deputy chief of staff, said it is possible
the task force could recommend more than one site to Hull and the
Legislature if there are several feasible alterna tives.
</P>
<P>
   The task force is studying how and where to build a new stadium
that could house the Arizona Cardi nals, the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl
and other sports events. Cardinals offi cials say the NFL team
needs a more modern, air-conditioned facil ity to increase
attendance, earn more money and remain competi tive.
</P>
<P>
   The team has not disclosed how much it would spend to finance
the stadium. The task force has been told some public money would
be needed, but Hull has ruled out a general tax increase as an
alterna tive. The cost of the proposed stadium is pegged at $329
million, but that doesn't include land pur chase, parking
facilities or site development.
</P>
<P>
   None of the sites proposed Thurs day was accompanied by offers
of free land, infrastructure development or other financial
incentives. But Giuliano said Tempe was prepared to work with the
task force to determine how it could contribute to stadium
development in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are anxious to have those discussions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Junker said negotiations begin next year on membership renewal
in the Bowl Championship Series, un der which the Fiesta, Sugar,
Orange and Rose bowls rotate as hosts of a national championship
game. The current rotation doesn't end for several more years, but
Junker is concerned about the Fiesta's long-term prospects because
of competition from new stadiums cropping up in other parts of the
country. Bigger, more modern stadi ums produce more money, which
appeals to the Bowl Championship Series and college football confer
ences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like every other business _ we need to grow,'' Junker
said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fiesta is allowed to keep ticket, concession and
advertising revenues from its event each year, a larger, more
luxurious stadium would guarantee both the attendance and revenues
needed to keep the Fiesta Bowl competitive for years.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``we're not here looking for a free pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Junker said the Fiesta Bowl would discuss putting up part of the
construction money when it was clear that a deal could be
structured to satisfy the bowl. So far, he said, he's encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Using temporary seating, the sta dium design being discussed
would fit 80,000 fans and have a partially retractable dome and
natural turf, all of which appeal to Fiesta Bowl officials. The
bowl could earmark certain revenues _ ticket sur charges, for
instance _ to fund a portion of construction costs.
</P>
<P>
   Sites proposed Thursday included one southeast of Bank One
Ballpark in downtown Phoenix, between Sev enth and 11th streets,
south of Jackson Street and north of Sher man Street. The property
is all private, owned primarily by the railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kearney of the Downtown Phoenix Alliance said the site
would not need to be rezoned and would ``allow significant spinoff
develop ment.'' Its proximity to other sports facilities would
allow it to take advantage of surrounding restau rants, bars,
hotels and shops. More than 22,000 parking spaces are available
within a three-quarter-mile radius.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the councilman, pro moted a 450-acre site, partly on
an old Phoenix landfill, that would provide easy access to
Interstate 17. The site includes 240 acres owned by the city just
north of the Salt River between Seventh and 19th avenues. Private
land farther north also would be used. It would need significant
work to prepare the site for development.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe proposed four sites:
</P>
<P>
   Papago Park Center, a parcel owned by Salt River Project. Seated
between the Salt River and Wash ington Street just east of Priest
Drive, it's near Tempe's Town Lake and along a proposed light-rail
route. About 7,000 parking spaces are available in the area, but
12,000 more would have to be built nearby.
</P>
<P>
   A larger site south of the river and east of McClintock Drive
that has various private owners, one of whom controls 50 acres.
It's on the proposed light-rail route but would need cleanup before
use. Part of the site now is a junkyard.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe Rio Salado Crossing, a site east of the Pima Freeway and
south of the Red Mountain Freeway. The land, held by Arizona State
University, Maricopa County and a few private landowners, offers
quick access to two freeways.
</P>
<P>
   A joint Mesa-Tempe site that straddles the city limits to take
in land owned by Mesa north of the Tempe Rio Salado Crossing. It
offers quick freeway access and room to develop parking lots, and
would permit joint development by both cities.

GRIFFEY HOLDING MARINERS HOSTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Any day now the Seattle Mariners ought to be
receiving Ken Griffey's updated Christmas wish list. Unless he
decided to bypass Pat Gillick altogether and send the note straight
to Kris Kringle, c/o the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   This Kringle fellow, after all, has made a long and storied
career of filling even the most outrageous requests.
</P>
<P>
   We can imagine Griffey sitting down earlier this week, after
nixing the Mariners' proposed trade of the All-Star outfielder to
the New York Mets, to clarify his desires, much like the child who
writes a follow-up letter to Santa to make sure the old guy is
clear it's the (begin ital)Pokemon Pinball(end ital) video game he
covets, not (begin ital)Pokemon Snap(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   Why, Griffey's letter probably is in some post office somewhere
right now, buried in a pile of Christmas cards. It ought to stick
out amid all the brightly colored envelopes, on account of all the
cut-out letters used to spell out the address.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that how ransom notes usually come packaged?
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about it: Griffey is holding the Mariners
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   If it was a World Series ring he was after, or a work address
closer to his family's Orlando home, he would have pumped his fists
at the chance to play for the Mets, who were on Griffey's original
list of 10 teams he'd play for.
</P>
<P>
   The deal that Gillick, the Seattle general manager, was close to
consummating was advantageous all around: Griffey would have been
freed from the prison Seattle has become to him; the Mariners,
having lost the franchise player in whom they've invested 11 years,
would have walked away with three nice parting gifts in Armando
Benitez, Octavio Dotel and Roger Cedeno; and the Mets, with
Griffey, would have wrested Gotham's attention away from the
reigning World Series champion Yankees, if only for a New York
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, Griffey has whittled his choice of teams he'll
play for to one _ Cincinnati, thereby painting Gillick into an
impossibly tight corner. Never mind getting Pokey Reese; let
Gillick try to ply Scott Williamson or a No. 1 draft pick out of
Reds general manager Jim Bowden now that Bowden knows there's no
other market for Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a squeeze play Griffey and his agent Brian Goldberg
are trying to pull off.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, they're not alone. Everywhere you look in major-league
baseball these days, people are ripping pages from the Gotti Family
book of negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   MLB? These days it might as well stand for Major League
Blackmailers.
</P>
<P>
   In L.A. we had Kevin Malone bribing the Cubs with Ismael Valdes
in order to rid the Dodgers of Eric Young.
</P>
<P>
   And agent Scott Boras continues to hold the Dodgers for a
princely ransom because they signed Adrian Beltre out of the
Dominican Republic before his 16th birthday. It says here Beltre's
birthdate never would have become an issue if he had hit .175 with
five home runs and 150 strikeouts this past season, his first full
one in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how Boras develops a conscience at the same time a market
is developing for Beltre's bat.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's baseball commissioner Bud Selig, who held the
Dodgers hostage throughout the winter meetings by failing to rule
on Beltre's request to become a free agent. He effectively tied the
Dodgers' hands. How were they supposed to proceed without knowing
if they were going to lose their third baseman or be obligated to
re-sign him at considerably more than the $220,000 he made last
season?
</P>
<P>
   Selig has said he's waiting to make his ruling until after he
sees Sandy Alderson's report on (begin ital)Le Affaire Adrian(end
ital). Given that baseball's executive vice president has had
almost two months to collect his information, all we can say is his
investigation better be as thorough as the Dowd report.
</P>
<P>
   Anything less will be suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's a tossup as to which is more troubling; Boras'
timing on Birthdategate or Selig playing Solomon in the affairs of
one National League team when he has kin operating a rival National
League team.
</P>
<P>
   With a commissioner like that, who needs collusion?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, baseball has more problems than the bats of Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa can fix.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball doesn't need a commissioner, it needs an independent
counsel. We'll take Ken Starr over Selig any day.
</P>
<P>
   There's something terribly wrong when a superstar like Griffey
can hold the Mariners hostage and an agent like Boras can hold the
Dodgers for ransom and players and management are so busy bickering
back and forth they forget all about the fans caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   They'll all be sorry, eventually. Because the fans, they'll find
out, are nobody's pawn. &QL;

RUNNING HARD IN THE BACK OF THE PACK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ The gun guys did not go in for fancy
decorations when they held their chat-and-chew for presidential
hopefuls here.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a couple of Christmas wreaths, there were just small
signs, hung near the ceiling of the Holiday Inn ballroom,
advertising some sponsors (Gun Owners of New Hampshire, the Kittery
Trading Post and the gun maker Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co.) and some
candidates (Gary Bauer, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Alan Keyes).
</P>
<P>
   All, though, were overshadowed by the huge blue banner behind
the moderator's lectern. It proclaimed ``Forbes 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene early this month pretty much sums up life on the
campaign trail for Bauer, Hatch and Keyes, the three candidates at
the back of the pack in the race for the Republican presidential
nomination. Even when the leading candidates do not show up, as
they did not at the Gun Owners of New Hampshire's presidential
forum, these three just cannot grab the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel like I am shouting into a void, and I wonder
if anybody's listening,'' said Keyes, a radio talk show host and
former state department official.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes and the others find themselves shoved into the shadows not
only by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of
Arizona but also by Steve Forbes, the wealthy magazine publisher.
Forbes may be running a distant third in the state, but he draws
double-digit support in polls. The three trailers, lucky to draw
more than 1 percent apiece, are outspent, outmanned, outgunned,
everything but out-talked.
</P>
<P>
   In fact as the candidates have participated in several debates
in New Hampshire and elsewhere, Hatch, Bauer and Keyes have more
than held their own. Hatch has jabbed at Bush over the governor's
experience and cracked jokes at the expense of the governor and
others.
</P>
<P>
   And pundits and politicians of all stripes, from George
Stephanopoulos to Sen. Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republican
Senatorial Campaign Committee, have praised the public speaking
skills of Bauer and Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a growing chorus of political professionals keeps
suggesting that the three of them, and possibly Forbes, get off the
stage and leave the campaign to the serious contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is,'' wrote Richard N. Bond, the former national
Republican chairman, in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times,
``that Orrin Hatch, Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer have had ample time
to establish themselves as viable candidates, and they have
failed.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll found that, nationally, more than half the
registered voters surveyed had no idea who Keyes or Bauer were. A
third did not recognize Hatch's name _ even though he has been a
senator since 1977 and even though, as head of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, he played an active role in the impeachment of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, New Hampshire, where even the most obscure candidate is
treated like a star, and where television advertisements have
traditionally been less important than pressing the flesh at
pancake breakfasts, presents an opportunity for the rear-runners to
put up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer has hired a former editorial writer for The Union Leader,
the state's biggest newspaper, as an adviser and gamely visits
Rotary clubs and junior high schools out where the highway signs
warn of meandering moose. Keyes, whose staff is less seasoned but
even more impassioned (he has acolytes rather than aides), is out
there, too. Even Hatch is traveling around New Hampshire more than
his staff had intended.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch and Keyes contend that prejudice may keep them from being
taken seriously. Keyes has complained bitterly that he is being
ignored by the news media because he is black and conservative. In
New Hampshire, he is almost always the only African-American in the
room. His staff is mostly white, said Connie Hair, his press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch suggests that he has been the victim of religious bias
among voters and in the news media. ``There's real anti-Mormon
prejudice out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer jokes about his small stature (he is 5-foot-6) as a
possible source of discrimination. But his advisers take his
appearance seriously enough to have run focus groups about it.
Women ``react to the fact that he doesn't look like a matinee idol
for three or four minutes and then forget about it,'' said Jeffrey
Bell, one of Bauer's aides.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest problem for all three is money. As of Sept. 30,
Bauer had raised $6.3 million; Keyes, $2.5 million; and Hatch, just
$1.3 million. By contrast, Bush has raised $57.7 million; Forbes,
$20.6 million; and McCain, $9.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   All that money buys big campaign buses, huge headquarters and
omnipresent television advertisements. Bush's staff wears snappy
fleece pullovers with his logo embroidered on the chest; Forbes has
a digital camera that produces instant mementos for anyone who
shakes his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, Hatch and Keyes have signs on sticks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that Hatch, contemplating the millions that Bush has
already spent, keeps saying, ``It's obscene!'' But his personal
bete noire seems to be McCain. Though Hatch often says how much ``I
care for John'' (and, all of his rivals), he cannot stop taking
jabs at McCain for his temper, his missed votes and his support for
background checks for people who buy guns at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   What may also rankle is McCain's popularity with the news media.
Hatch, by contrast, has a hard time attracting media attention,
even in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   After a debate here in early December, for example, Hatch could
scarcely make himself heard over the roar of hundreds of reporters
who joked, gossiped, chatted and typed while he tried to answer
questions. There were not many.
</P>
<P>
   But 90 minutes after the debate, Hatch was still in the press
room, talking away.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing what he calls his rivals' lack of experience, Hatch
talks over and over about the bills he has passed, about ``the
biggest change in patent law in 50 years,'' about Internet
regulations, about health care programs for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very conservative,'' he said, ``but I'm the only one with
a proven record of working with Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But that very experience may be turning off the conservative
voters Hatch hopes to woo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orrin Hatch is somebody who talks conservative back home but
votes with his friend Teddy Kennedy too often,'' said Craig
Sanborn, a postal worker from Enfield Center, N.H., at the gun
owners' dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Elective experience, or the lack of it, does not weigh with
Bauer. Asked why he did not run for a less prominent office, he
said most other positions would be a step down, compared with his
job as president of the Family Research Council, a conservative
fund-raising and lobbying group in Washington. He is on leave from
the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm already more influential than the typical member of the
House of Representatives, and arguably as influential as a
senator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And influence appears to be his goal. While his staff insists
Bauer is running because he believes he can win, staff members talk
a lot about how his candidacy has solidified his position as the
voice of American conservatives, and how, as his spokesman, Timothy
S. Goeglein said, his campaign ``can help shape the contours of the
party.''
</P>
<P>
   At the gun owners' dinner, his speech seemed to rivet the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary not only held his own but made ground,'' said R. Craig
Peterson, president of the Gun Owners of New Hampshire. Bauer's
success was especially surprising, Peterson added, because ``it's
tough coming after Alan Keyes _ he's a great orator.''
</P>
<P>
   Such compliments make Keyes' supporters bristle, because they
think he is much more than a good speaker. ``He's a brilliant man,
a great leader,'' said Judy Stephens, a visiting nurse from
Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   But style is important in a race with so many candidates who
seem to share many positions. The trailing candidates all speak
about their belief in God and morality, and about their opposition
to abortion, gun control and the federal tax system.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point it will start to occur to people that they
should put somebody out there that people want to hear and see.''
Keyes said. ``That seems to be one of the big qualities involved in
running for office.''
</P>
<P>
   He can clearly draw a crowd. Rebecca Grubbs of Brookline, N.H.,
who was eight months pregnant, left her 2-year-old son with a
sitter for the first time so she could hear Keyes at the gun
owners' dinner.
</P>
<P>
   And Keyes did not disappoint. His speech was interrupted by
applause more than any other candidates, and his proposal that high
school students be taught how to use guns went over well with the
crowd of about 400, some of whom carried bumper stickers that read,
``I love my country, I fear my government.''
</P>
<P>
   But Keyes suffers, like the other trailing candidates, from
having a small staff and little money. After the dinner, Peterson,
the group's president, was approached by a member who was carrying
a huge plastic case. Keyes needed to have his banner put in the
case and shipped to another campaign stop, she said. Find one of
his people, Peterson replied.
</P>
<P>
   But the banner _ and Keyes' staff _ had disappeared.

 &HT;    Attempt to steal balloons, tires goes bust
 &HT;    By John Lynch
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ How do you get rid of a 140-foot tall,
800-pound internationally known corporate icon that resembles the
Pillsbury Dough Boy?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently that question stumped some thieves Thursday morning
because they abandoned a trailer containing a hot-air balloon
shaped like Bib the Michelin Man south of Longview, said Gregg
County Sheriff Bobby Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a first for me,'' he said about recovering a stolen
balloon.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy on patrol found a brightly colored blue and yellow
trailer emblazoned with the 101-year-old trademark of the
international tire-maker shortly after 7 a.m., Weaver said. The
trailer hadn't been reported stolen, he said, but investigators
became suspicious when they noticed the trailer wasn't locked.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said he contacted several members of Longview's
ballooning community, trying to determine who owned the trailer and
its contents. His fifth call reached Guy Gauthier, owner of Balloon
Repairs of East Texas, who was surprised to learn it was missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Guy, who has the Michelin Man,' and he said, `I do,'
'' Weaver said. ``It was as much a surprise to me as it was to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The trailer contained about $250,000 worth of ballooning
equipment, including a second traditional balloon and a Bib costume
for personal appearances, Gauthier said. The trailer and equipment
belongs to a Florida advertising company, he said, and the balloons
had been at Gauthier's shop for routine maintenance since October
after appearing at the Albuquerque International Hot Air Balloon
Fiesta in New Mexico. Gauthier said the trailer had been locked up
in the back of his shop, and thieves cut through two padlocks
sometime Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The balloon's pilot will be in Longview today to inventory the
trailer, but Gauthier was able to determine two fans used to
inflate the balloons were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver and Gauthier say they don't think the thieves intended to
steal hot-air balloons, but thought they were getting a trailer
full of Michelin tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure when they saw the trailer, they thought they had a
load of tires _ these (balloons) are a little harder to get rid
of,'' Gauthier said.
</P>
<P>
   The thieves would have a hard time disposing of the balloons, he
said, estimating the entire American ballooning community could be
notified within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's investigators checked the trailer and equipment for
fingerprints and continue to investigate the theft.
</P>
<P>
   The Michelin Man balloon has made several appearances at
Longview's Great Texas Balloon Race, Gauthier said. He said the
balloon is about twice the height and four times the weight of a
traditional 75-foot, 200-pound balloon.
</P>
<P>
   The Michelin Man, a white stack of animated tires, has
represented the France-based company since 1898 and takes his name
from the French word meaning ``to drink,'' according to the
company's Web site.

EDITORIAL: LOOKING BACK AT RWANDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 17:
</P>
<P>
   Five years after the slaughter of as many as 800,000 Tutsi in
Rwanda, the world is still grappling with its failure to prevent
the killing. The United Nations published a sobering, self-critical
report on Thursday that catalogd in painful detail how it ignored
abundant warnings of impending carnage and withdrew most of its
peacekeeping force as the massacres began. In Tanzania, meanwhile,
the United Nations' war crimes tribunal charged with prosecuting
those responsible for the genocide in Rwanda faces questions about
its very survival after an appeals court ordered the release of a
suspect because he had been held for nearly two years without being
formally charged.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. report is noteworthy less for its sadly familiar
account than for the fact of its existence and its timing. It comes
a month after a comparably critical internal report that showed how
the United Nations allowed the Bosnian Muslim ``safe area'' of
Srebrenica to be overrun in July 1995 by Bosnian Serbs, who then
killed thousands of the town's men and boys. Together these
inquiries establish an admirable new standard of candor at the
United Nations under Secretary General Kofi Annan. They can point
the way to more effective international action if similar cases
arise in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwanda report does not spare Annan, who was in charge of the
United Nations' peacekeeping operations during the killings. But it
properly decries the ``lack of political will'' among member
nations, not least the United States, which set Annan's agenda.
Washington, shaken by the killing of American peacekeepers in
Somalia in 1993, blocked effective U.N. action in Rwanda. President
Clinton acknowledged last year that he ``did not do as much as we
could have and should have.''
</P>
<P>
   The report underscores the importance of the United Nations'
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which was established
in September 1994 in part to make amends for the United Nations'
earlier failure. In five years the tribunal has made fitful but
undeniable progress, reinforced last week by the conviction and
life sentence handed down against Georges Rutaganda, vice president
of the Interahamwe, the machete-wielding gangs that hacked their
Tutsi neighbors to death in three months of concentrated slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   But the tribunal's legitimacy has been cast in doubt by an
appeals court ruling that another suspect should be released, in
part because of the tribunal staff's own negligence. Last month the
Appeals Chamber in The Hague, which oversees both the Rwanda
tribunal and its better known counterpart, the war crimes tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia, ordered the release of Jean-Bosco
Barayagwiza, who had been charged with genocide and crimes against
humanity. The appeals court said his due process rights had been
denied because he was held for 19 months in Cameroon before being
handed over to the tribunal and formally charged.
</P>
<P>
   The court has agreed to reconsider, but not before an outraged
Rwandan government, now dominated by Tutsi survivors of the
genocide, suspended its cooperation with the tribunal. The response
is understandable, but it is in Rwanda's own interest to resume
cooperation. Rwanda lacks the resources to try top suspects itself.
The procedural integrity of the tribunal is critically important.
Those who have backed the tribunal thus far, including the Clinton
administration, should provide the resources and oversight to
ensure that similar mistakes are not made in the months ahead.

HEALTH OFFICIAL REVEALS PLAN TO AVERT WEST NILE ILLNESS IN NEW YORK
REGION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York state's health commissioner said on Thursday
that the state's residents should ``not be concerned'' about a
possible return of the West Nile virus that killed seven people and
sickened dozens of others in the region last summer, because the
state has organized a full-scale campaign to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   But some regional health commissioners said that they were
concerned about how they were going to pay for local mosquito
control and related services. Other officials, including those in
New York City, said that they already had a program in place to
deal with mosquito control and did not need guidance from the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from around the state and from the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention met on Monday to discuss a plan to
prepare for next spring, when mosquito larvae hatch and could
potentially reintroduce West Nile to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans, outlined by the health commissioner, Dr. Antonia C.
Novello, during a news conference in Manhattan on Thursday, include
strengthening the state's thinly staffed mosquito surveillance
unit, which traps the insects and tests them for dangerous
diseases, hiring more staff for the state laboratory where samples
from both infected birds and humans are tested in an effort to
detect any outbreak early and stop it, and mounting a large public
health advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, officials said they had just started to meet this
week to form a plan for the spring. In Connecticut, where dead
birds were found to have carried the disease, experts said that
they would be adjusting their existing program to take West Nile
into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in very good shape,'' said Jane Stahl, the deputy
commissioner for Connecticut's environmental protection agency.
``Our spray program has always included preventive programs'' and a
program for municipalities to make sure there are no areas of
standing water.
</P>
<P>
   Novello said that 35 new full-time employees have been added to
the department to take on the threat of West Nile, including
scientists who test mosquitoes and birds for diseases. Most experts
on insects and infectious diseases agree that careful surveillance
is the best method of controlling diseases that are introduced into
new environments; spraying for mosquitoes after a disease has shown
up in humans is costly and largely ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   But the ability of regional health departments to strengthen
their programs is hindered by a lack of money, commissioners said.
``There was no discussion at that meeting about revising how state
aid is provided,'' said Dr. Kathy Gaffney, the health commissioner
of Nassau County on Long Island. ``We spend $1 million in that area
and get $55,000 in state aid. We are supposed to be in public
health, but we don't get funding until it is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has said it would pick up half of any city's expenses
for dealing with the West Nile virus, but only if that city had an
outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus, which until last summer had not been found
in the Western Hemisphere, killed six New Yorkers and one Canadian
tourist between July and September. The virus is carried by birds,
which can be bitten by mosquitoes that then transmit the illness to
humans. The virus is usually mild, although in severe cases, it can
develop into an encephalitis that can be fatal. Those who are most
vulnerable to life-threatening cases are the elderly, children
under 5 and people with weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   While human cases of West Nile were believed to have been
limited to the New York region this summer, birds infected with the
virus were found as far south at Baltimore, and federal agencies
continue to test birds along the eastern seaboard.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Novello also said that the state would work closely with
veterinarians to identify cases of West Nile in horses and other
domestic animals, to improve information systems so counties and
the state can quickly share information about a potential disease
as it moves across the region, and to encourage residents to reduce
the number of mosquitoes by keeping pools of stagnant water to a
minimum.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, where most of the West Nile cases were found
last summer, plans for mosquito surveillance are already well
underway, said the city's health commissioner, Dr. Neal Cohen, who
added that the city would also test chickens and other birds for
traces of the illness, ideally before there are any human cases.
The city will not spray for mosquitoes unless it is sure that
infected bugs or animals are in the area. ``We don't see pesticide
spraying as a first line of control,'' Cohen said.

FROM RWANDA STUDY: `SERIOUS MISTAKES WERE MADE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (With RWANDA-REPORT) 
(mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Following are excerpts from the ``Independent
Inquiry Into the Actions of the United Nations During the 1994
Genocide in Rwanda'' that focus on the reaction at headquarters to
a report by the U.N. commander in Rwanda, Gen. Romeo Dallaire of
Canada, to Maj. Gen. Maurice Baril, a Canadian who was a military
adviser to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali:
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility for the limitations of the original mandate
given to Unamir (the U.N. mission in Rwanda) lies firstly with the
United Nations Secretariat, the secretary-general and responsible
officials within the DPKO (Department of Peacekeeping Operations)
for the mistaken analysis which underpinned the recommendations to
the council and for recommending that the mission be composed of
fewer troops than the field mission had considered necessary. The
member states which had exercised pressure upon the Secretariat to
limit the proposed number of troops also bear part of the
responsibility. Not least, the Security Council itself bears the
responsibility for the hesitance to support new peacekeeping
operations in the aftermath of Somalia, and specifically in this
instance for having decided to limit the mandate of the mission in
respect to the weapons-secure area.
</P>
<P>
   Implementation of Mandate
</P>
<P>
   Further serious difficulties arose with respect to the
implementation of Unamir's mandate. Unamir's mandate was cautious
in its inception; it was to become equally so in its application on
the ground. Headquarters consistently decided to apply the mandate
in a manner which would preserve a neutral role of Unamir under a
traditional peacekeeping mandate. This was the scope of action that
was perceived to have support in the Security Council. Despite
facing a deteriorating security situation, which would have
motivated a more assertive and preventive role for the United
Nations, no steps were taken to adjust the mandate to the reality
of the needs in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The cable sent by Dallaire to Baril on Jan. 11 regarding
contacts with an informant brought into focus key aspects of how
Unamir implemented its mandate. The inquiry believes that serious
mistakes were made in dealing with the cable.
</P>
<P>
   Firstly, the information contained in the cable, and in
particular the information indicating the existence of a plan to
exterminate Tutsi, was so important that it should have been given
the highest priority and attention and shared at the highest level.
Mistakes were made both in Unamir and in the Secretariat in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
   Dallaire should have addressed the cable not only to Baril; it
clearly warranted the immediate attention of _ at the very least _
the undersecretaries-general for peacekeeping and political
affairs. In fact, despite being sent only to Baril, the cable was
then shared by him with the rest of the leadership of DPKO. Annan
and Riza's instructions to Unamir _ and the caution which dominates
these instructions _ show that they did realize that the cable
contained very significant information. (Iqbal Riza was the top
U.N. peacekeeping official.) However, they did not brief the
secretary-general about it. And the Security Council _ which a week
before had conditioned its continued support for Unamir on progress
in the peace process _ was not informed. Informing the three
embassies in Kigali was not enough....
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, it is incomprehensible to the inquiry that not more
was done to follow up on the information provided by the informant.
Having decided to share the information with President Habyarimana
with the aim of getting him to act on it, constant pressure should
have been put on the president to see to it that he took the action
he had promised.
</P>
<P>
   This applies to all three aspects of the cable. Information
received by a United Nations mission that plans are being made to
exterminate any group of people requires an immediate and
determined response, in this case certainly, action more forceful
than the meetings which were held with President Habyarimana....
</P>
<P>
   Shadow of Somalia
</P>
<P>
   It has often been said that Unamir was an operation which was
created in the shadow of Somalia. In particular, the deaths of the
Pakistani and U.S. peacekeepers in Somalia in 1993 had a deep
effect on the attitude towards the conduct of peacekeeping
operations....
</P>
<P>
   For the government of the United States, the events in Mogadishu
were a watershed in its policy towards U.N. peacekeeping. By May
1994, when the genocide in Rwanda began, President Clinton had
enacted PDD 25, a directive which placed strict conditions on U.S.
support for United Nations peacekeeping. The killings of the
peacekeepers in Somalia also had a restrictive effect on the U.N.
Secretariat, in particular with regard to the risks that could be
assumed during peacekeeping operations and in respect to the
interpretation of mandates. This legacy of Somalia was of
particular importance to the conduct of Unamir....
</P>
<P>
   In sum, while criticisms can be leveled at the mistakes and
limitations of the capacity of Unamir's troops, one should not
forget the responsibility of the great majority of United Nations
member states, which were not prepared to send any troops or
materiel at all to Rwanda.

ADVERTISING: LANCOME WILL SHOW MODELS WITH FRECKLES AND ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a saying that beauty is not a pretty
business. If there isn't, maybe there should be, because
competition in the cosmetics field, particularly at the
higher-priced end, is getting almost, well, ugly.
</P>
<P>
   The giants that dominate the upper tier of the industry are
intensifying their fractious battling as they increase advertising
budgets for premium makeup, skin care and fragrance brands; bring
out additional products, and rework long-running campaigns. For
instance, for the new year L'Oreal, the U.S.. subsidiary of
Cosmair, will significantly revamp the marketing efforts for its
popular Lancome line.
</P>
<P>
   Lancome ranks third in sales in American department stores,
according to Mottus &AMP; Associates in New York, behind only two
brands belonging to the Estee Lauder &UR;  &LR; Cos., Estee Lauder and
Clinique. Other competitors include products sold by Chanel, LVMH
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to reinforce our brand territory,'' said Marc
Menesguen, president of Lancome International in Paris, ``we want
to enter the new millennium with a new brand expression: more
contemporary, more relevant, more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women were telling us Lancome is a fantastic brand,'' he
added, summarizing the results of what he described as a year's
research among 5,000 consumers in eight countries, ``but they
wanted us to say it with more conviction, maybe with a little bit
more courage.''
</P>
<P>
   What could constitute courage when it comes to peddling products
like lotions, lipsticks and wrinkle creams? Perhaps running a
photograph of a model in a print ad that is not heavily retouched,
leaving some of her freckles visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this category, that's a breakthrough,'' said Tony
DeGregorio, president and chief creative officer at the New York
office of Publicis, the Lancome agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's less technique to the way the women are
photographed,'' he added, ``so it's less artful.''
</P>
<P>
   According to DeGregorio, that offers consumers ``a much more
human, approachable, intimate interpretation of beauty,'' which
``is a bold, confident way of saying, `Get in touch with your inner
beauty.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another step on the road to approachability is an apparent
renaming of at least one product: in a print ad, Rouge Magnetic
lipstick seems to have lost its accent mark.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, created by offices of Publicis, part of Publicis
SA, in Canada, France and the United States, introduces as a theme
the phrase ``Believe in beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to help every woman find her own beauty,'' said Luc
Nadeau, senior vice president and general manager at Lancome USA in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tested this new campaign carefully,'' he added, ``and found
it spoke not only to reason but to the heart, letting each woman
have the freedom to interpret as she wants.''
</P>
<P>
   The print, television and radio campaign, which also includes
materials for retailers, makes over a series of ads running since
September 1996 that have been centered on images of roses, the
Lancome brand icon, standing tall, as if blooming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rose is a symbol of femininity, elegance, unique to
Lancome,'' Menesguen said. ``It's a strong actor in the new
campaign, but less rigid than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes there's a complete rose,'' he added, ``and sometimes
there's a petal.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, as in a print ad for Primordiale Intense skin
lotion, the rose gets the star treatment, appearing by itself
rather than accompanied by a model's face.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's turn, as Stephen Sondheim might call it.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is starting with ads in January issues of more than
two dozen magazines, some already being sent to subscribers and
sold on newsstands. They include Allure, Cosmopolitan, Elle,
Harper's Bazaar, In Style, Interview, Jane, Mademoiselle, Marie
Claire, Mode, More, People, Self, Texas Monthly, Vogue and W.
</P>
<P>
   The first TV commercial, for a new product named Re-Surface
Retinol Concentrate Intense Wrinkle Corrector, is scheduled to
begin running the week after Christmas on local stations in large
markets like Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Lancome executives declined to specify spending for
the campaign around the world, Menesguen said: ``This year, our
media expenditures increased at a double-digit rate. And we're
definitely planning to keep that rate of growth next year.''
</P>
<P>
   In this country, Lancome and retailers will spend an estimated
$35 million in 2000 on television, radio and print advertising.

WOMAN WHO LED DRUG RING IS SENTENCEDHED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Colombian woman convicted of running an
international drug ring was sentenced to life in prison on Thursday
by a federal judge who cited the huge quantity of drugs her
organization had sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Mery Valencia, 46, was convicted on July 30 after a
two-month trial on charges of leading a conspiracy that sold 12,000
kilograms of cocaine, with a wholesale value of more than $180
million, in the United States from the late 1980s until 1997, when
she was arrested in Brazil. She was later extradited to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony showed that the cocaine was held in ``stash houses''
in Florida, Texas and California, and eventually sold in New York
and elsewhere. On Thursday, Ms. Valencia wept and apologized to
Judge Kimba M. Wood of Federal District Court in Manhattan for
having ``taken the wrong path'' in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very remorseful for what I did,'' she said through a
translator, ``and I'm paying a very high price.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Valencia's organization was seen as unusual, if not unique,
because its senior leadership was almost entirely female. Of the
more than 75 people charged in connection with the investigation
into her drug ring, more than a dozen were women, the indictment
showed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Valencia also relied on women in her own family, the
indictment charged, including her sister, Luz Dary Valencia
Castrillon, who is suspected of being a manager in the cocaine
conspiracy responsible for arranging to deposit drug proceeds in
U.S. banks.
</P>
<P>
   Ana Maria Valencia, Mery Valencia's sister-in-law, was described
in the charges as the manager of deliveries and pickups of money in
the United States. Both women have been charged, but neither has
been arrested, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Ms. Valencia's lawyer, Merrill Rubin, asked Judge Wood
not to impose a life term, given Ms. Valencia's age, and his view
that a life term would not deter other narcotics traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one person is removed from the scene,'' Rubin said, ``there
are five people clamoring to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   But a federal prosecutor, James J. Benjamin Jr., disagreed. He
cited phone conversations of Ms. Valencia's associates that had
been recorded on government wiretaps. The conversations showed that
there was much discussion about how to avoid having her extradited,
and the consequences for the ring of a long imprisonment for Ms.
Valencia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin also noted the ``huge geographical temporal scope'' of
her operation and the ``tremendous consequences'' for lower-ranking
ring members who were arrested, and for those who had used the
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wood said that although not everyone might be deterred,
she agreed with the government ``that there is a reasonable
likelihood of deterring some conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   She also ordered Ms. Valencia to pay a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five other defendants in the case in New York have pleaded
guilty to charges that include narcotics offenses and money
laundering, and more than 30 others are at large, according to the
office of U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White in Manhattan.
