AS DAMAGE ESTIMATES INCREASE, VOTE IN TRENTON IS SET ON FLOOD AID 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey legislators are nearing an agreement
that would provide $50 million in assistance to victims of last
month's flooding.
</P>
<P>
   After several protests by flood victims who criticized the state
Legislature for reacting too slowly, Assembly members are expected
to vote Monday on a package that would provide grants and loans to
homeowners and businesses damaged in the flooding that followed
Tropical Storm Floyd, and another $30 million for farmers whose
crops were destroyed by the summer drought. In an effort to speed
the relief, legislators agreed they would turn the funds over to
Gov. Christie Whitman, whose administration would decide how to
distribute them.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came as Carl A. Wyhopen, an assistant attorney
general who works with the Office of Emergency Management, said
engineers who inspected Bergen, Passaic and Somerset Counties fear
that damage is more extensive than first estimated. The inspectors
found that the flood destroyed 71 homes, 75 businesses and 105
apartments, he said. It caused at least limited damage to more than
27,000 homes and 1,700 businesses in nine counties, and had the
most devastating impact in Plainfield, Piscataway, Lodi, Bound
Brook, Rochelle Park and Saddle Brook. The cost of the damage,
already estimated at nearly $500 million, is likely to rise in the
coming weeks, Wyhopen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst disaster I've seen, in terms of overall damage
and the threat to immediate safety that occurred during the
disaster,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have paid $16 million in disaster aid for
emergency shelter and provided another $4 million in loans to flood
victims in New Jersey, Wyhopen said. Peter J. Martinasco, an
official of the federal Emergency Management Agency, said at public
hearings Thursday that the agency expects to give up to $100
million in loans and grants to New Jersey residents and businesses
in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since the flood, New Jersey residents who lost
homes or businesses have complained that the federal government has
not offered enough aid to victims. Residents of Bound Brook, where
many businesses were ruined by the flooding, have also criticized
Assembly members, who have been busy campaigning for re-election
this fall and have not been in session since early summer.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, who was picketed by flood victims
from Bound Brook early this month as he hosted a fund-raising event
for presidential candidate George W. Bush, said it would have been
disingenuous for legislators to hold hearings about the disaster
before they had an accurate assessment of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a government don't want to build up people's hopes and
expectations, then rip it out from under them,'' said Collins, a
Republican from Woodstown. ``First you have to gather information
before you can gauge what's going on.''

NEW YORK CITY'S STREET CRIME UNIT WILL BE SPLIT INTO 8 PIECES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After eight months of intense criticism following the
fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo, Police Commissioner Howard Safir
said Friday that the Street Crime Unit would be broken up into
eight separate units reporting to regional commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization is the latest in a series of changes since
February, when Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant, was
fatally shot 19 times by four plainclothes members of the unit
outside his apartment building in the Bronx. The shooting prompted
protests and a civil rights inquiry. In March, the four officers
were indicted on second-degree murder charges by a Bronx grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   The Street Crime Unit had been credited with reducing the number
of guns on the streets, largely by using aggressive stop-and-frisk
tactics. But residents of predominantly minority neighborhoods
criticized the unit's methods, saying that the plainclothes
officers often stopped people on the street for no reason.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Safir placed the unit's officers in uniform, a factor
that police commanders have said contributed to the almost 10
percent increase in homicides this year as compared with the same
period last year. Safir reversed his decision two months ago,
allowing some of the officers to go back into plainclothes after
overall gun seizures began plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   The latest change, to occur in the next few weeks, will move the
350 officers in the unit into specialized Street Crime Units in
each of the Police Department's eight regions _ two each in
Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens, and one each in the Bronx and
Staten Island _ police officials said. The name of the units and
the number of officers in the units will stay the same, but the
reorganization will represent a significant change in the way the
units operate.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the reorganization was a unanimous recommendation of
the eight regional commanders, and was not motivated by the
criticism after the Diallo shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two days, in an unusually public display of
dissent within the department, officers hoisted a white flag above
the roof of the Street Crime Unit's headquarters on Randalls
Island. The officers said the flag symbolized their feeling that
the department had turned its back on the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Scotto, president of the Detectives Endowment
Association, a union that represents many officers in the Street
Crime Unit, said that while it might be a good idea to decentralize
the unit, Safir had aroused suspicion by not consulting members of
the unit or the unions.

<P>
   (Editors please note: This is a writethru of ABDUCT-KANSAS, sent
earlier.) KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ...have gotten here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pickup was next seen just before midnight Tuesday, parked in
the 3000 block of East 14th Street, about four blocks from the home
of Nelson's mother. It had been emptied, vacuumed and scrubbed
inside and out, according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   When investigators removed the seat, the affidavit said, they
found longish, light-colored hair strands that matched Pamela's.
</P>
<P>
   The pickup belongs to an Independence company, and its owner
told authorities he had lent the vehicle to Nelson about two weeks
earlier, according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at the home of Nelson's mother, detectives saw an afghan
similar to the one that the custodian had described as being in the
truck. A tracking dog that had sniffed clothes from Pamela's room
was taken around the house, and the dog stopped at the afghan.
</P>
<P>
   A two-day manhunt ended about 1:30 p.m. Thursday when Nelson was
found near the Kansas River by a civilian employee of the Kansas
City, Kan., Police Department. She had taken lunch to her husband
on the job at the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad tracks near
18th Street and decided to take a slow drive along the dike on a
hunch that Nelson might be there.
</P>
<P>
   She spotted a man near the expressway bridge, and he hobbled on
an injured leg into the river. Railroad workers took Nelson to
shore and held him for police, who passed him off to a helicopter
ambulance crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the investigation ended up in Grain Valley is a
little unusual,'' said FBI Special Agent Larry McCormick. Grain
Valley is about 20 miles from Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope that things like this don't ever happen,'' said
Scherer. ``And you certainly never expect them to happen in a small
community such as Grain Valley. But at least this brings some
closure to this today, although it was not the closure we were
hoping for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every agent is as depressed and saddened as anyone,''
McCormick said. ``It does get personal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And our sympathy does go out to the family,'' Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
   Cherri West, Pamela's mother, said her family needed help for
the burial. Donations can be sent to the Pamela Butler and Family
Fund, First State Bank, 650 Kansas Ave., Kansas City, KS 66105.
Checks should be made out to the Pamela Butler and Family Fund.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Piazza kicked first base as his eighth-inning
fly ball was caught, a sudden and lonely gesture of frustration
interrupting an evening of creeping, vexing futility. The New York
Mets went down quietly to the Atlanta Braves again Friday night,
1-0, and now, for all the bombast and headline-making of the last
three weeks, their season is a whisper away from finished.
</P>
<P>
   Down by 0-3 in the best-of-7 National League Championship
Series, the Mets will try Saturday night to stave off what now
seems nearly inevitable, an elimination that seemed almost as
inevitable two weeks ago, when the Mets nearly missed the playoffs
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the Mets can hardly hope to salvage their season
against a low-rent team like the Pittsburgh Pirates. Instead, they
must try to conjure another miracle _ actually four miracles in a
row _ against the Atlanta Braves, who have beaten them 12 of the 15
times the teams have played this season, including eight times in
the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets failed to score Friday night against Tom Glavine, the
veteran left-hander, who pitched seven shutout innings at Shea
Stadium before turning things over to the bullpen. Out of that
bullpen in the ninth came John Rocker, public enemy No. 1 in the
eyes of Mets' fans, but a blur in the eyes of Mets' batters this
season. Though he allowed a leadoff single, Rocker retired the next
three Mets to end the game and leave the clincher Saturday night in
the very capable hands of John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets will pin their hopes on Rick Reed, and they can only
hope he can match the effort by Al Leiter Friday night. Leiter
allowed just three hits in seven innings and the Atlanta run, which
came without a hit, was unearned.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter had struggled for much of the season but had performed
well in some of the biggest games of the season. In his three
starts before Friday night's, the Mets beat Atlanta to end a
seven-game losing streak, beat Cincinnati to clinch the wild card
(a complete-game shutout) and beat Arizona to win the division
series. In that span, he had a 1.90 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   The common denominator in the three starts was Leiter's not
allowing a first-inning run, overcoming a second-half tendency to
begin the game feeling too relaxed and unable to focus.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday night's game, Leiter noted how important it was
for him to start well because Glavine was sure to be tough on the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   But Leiter's night began clumsily. He walked the leadoff hitter,
Gerald Williams, on a full count and got ahead of Bret Boone, 1-2,
before Boone hit what appeared to be a routine comebacker to the
mound. Leiter fielded the ball, glanced briefly at second base then
threw to first.
</P>
<P>
   But his throw was high and it pulled John Olerud way off the
bag. Boone was safe on Leiter's error and Leiter clutched his head
in frustration. Chipper Jones, who beat the Mets almost
single-handedly during Atlanta's sweep three weeks ago, was up, but
Leiter threw him two pitches inside, and then got him to pop up to
second base.
</P>
<P>
   On the first pitch to Brian Jordan, the Braves opted for a
double steal. Williams broke for third, but Boone left first late.
Mike Piazza's throw to second was high and the ball rolled into
center field as Williams scored to give the Braves a 1-0 lead. It
was the first time this season the Mets had had two errors in one
inning.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets' defense would keep them in the game, and it saved
Leiter from digging a huge hole. Jordan flew out to center field,
where Melvin Mora, a call-up from Triple-A when the rosters
expanded for the last month of the season, was making just his
third start of the year. Manager Bobby Valentine had put Mora in
the starting lineup because he was the Mets' best defensive
outfielder _ he threw out Jay Bell at the plate to save the Mets'
lead in the final game of the division series _ and because he has
had a hot bat. Mora caught Jordan's fly ball and then fired home as
Boone headed for the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The throw was perfect, on line and early. Piazza braced for the
hit and it came hard, with Boone smashing into Piazza's left
shoulder and jaw, knocking the catcher on his back and causing a
slight concussion that Piazza would play with for the rest of the
game. Piazza held the ball for the third out as Valentine's lineup
gamble with Mora paid off immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine had juggled the lineup to move Edgardo Alfonzo, who
was 4 for 8 in the series, into the third spot and to put space
between left-handers Olerud and Robin Ventura in the batting order
so that one reliever would be unlikely to face both in one inning.
But that move did not make a difference early in the game against
Glavine, who was 3-0 with a 1.71 ERA against the Mets entering the
game. Rickey Henderson struck out looking and after Olerud walked,
Alfonzo struck out, and Piazza grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter was still shaky in the second inning. He struck out
Andruw Jones, but his last pitch was wild and got past Piazza,
allowing Jones to reach first base. Eddie Perez, who has homered in
each of the first two games, then smacked a grounder deep into the
hole, where shortstop Rey Ordonez slid to his right and gloved the
ball, but lost it while trying to pull it out to make the throw.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was now at first, Jones was at second and there were no
outs. But Brian Hunter lined out to third on a 3-1 count and an
alert Ventura threw to second base to catch Jones off the bag for
the double play. Leiter struck out Walt Weiss to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter finally worked an uneventful inning, retiring the side on
ground balls in the third. And in the fourth, it was a suddenly
resurgent Henderson who saved him.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who was 0 for 4 in Game 1, left Game 2 with flu
symptoms. Batters know that a hit to left field can frequently be
stretched to a double because the 40-year-old outfielder, whose arm
is nothing to fear, has been slow to retrieve a ball at times. But
when Chipper Jones tried to stretch a leadoff single to left into a
double, Henderson fired a perfect strike to Alfonzo to nab Jones at
second.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, Henderson did the same thing with Perez, who led off
the next inning. Leiter walked Hunter, but Walt Weiss grounded up
the middle. Alfonzo fielded the ball while going to his right, then
flipped it across his body to Ordonez, who got the force out on
Hunter. Leiter then settled down and pitched marvelously. He struck
out Glavine to end the fifth, retired the side in order in the
sixth and allowed only a walk in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   In seven innings, he gave up just three singles and the only
Braves run was unearned.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Mets' offense _ shakeup and all _ remained stagnant.
Mora was superb _ he had singles in his first two at-bats _ but
Alfonzo, Ventura and Benny Agbayani were each 0 for 3 through the
fifth inning, and the Mets had stranded seven runners _ including
two at third base _ through six innings, including Piazza, who had
his first two hits of the series.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the story of the season involving these two teams.
Only one of the Mets' 11 losses in the first 15 meetings came on a
blowout, and eight of the losses entering Friday's night's game had
been by three runs or less. The narrow margins had convinced the
Mets that they could still beat the Braves, if only their offense
could come unstuck. They are running out of games to loosen it,
though.

SARAH FISHER, 19, SEEKS A BIT OF INDY-CAR HISTORY TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Sarah Fisher saw an old friend after the first Indy
Racing League practice session yesterday at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Saldana, who will race this weekend in the Pennzoil World
of Outlaws event at Devil's Bowl Speedway, came by to visit after
Fisher posted the 10th-best lap in the early practice session. The
two have raced against each other in Sprint Cars at several Midwest
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have known Joey since I got into Sprint Cars,'' Fisher said.
``I look up to him in Sprint Cars, and, if anything, I wish he
could be in the IRL.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Saldana also served as a reminder of how far Fisher, a
19-year-old from Ohio, has come the past two months. Today she will
attempt to qualify for her first IRL race in the No. 48 Mead/Team
Pelfrey Dallara/Aurora. Qualifying today starts at noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What impresses me most about her is that she does what you
say,'' said her Team Pelfrey teammate, Robby Unser. ``You don't
have to color-code it. You tell her, go here, don't go there, and
she won't go there. She is extremely bright in how she assimilates
the information given to her. Her learning curve is quick.''
</P>
<P>
   If she qualifies for the Mall.com 500 to be run tomorrow, she
will be the youngest driver to take a green flag in an IRL race and
only the fifth woman to race in a major North American open-wheel
race.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher started racing at age 5 in Quarter Midgets, moved to
Karts at age 8, and made the huge jump to race Sprint Cars on dirt
tracks in the Midwest, as her father, David, did for so many years.
This past year, she raced Midgets on the United States Auto Club
circuit. After 21 races, including a feature victory on the high
banks of Winchester (Ind.) Speedway, Fisher was approached by team
owner Dale Pelfrey about an IRL ride. He has known Fisher since she
was a youngster growing up in Commercial Point, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher accepted, and postponed entering Ohio State University as
a freshman until the second semester, when she plans to enroll as a
mechanical engineering major. ``She is as cool as anybody I've ever
seen. She's unshakable,'' Pelfrey has said. ``She's natural for a
race-car driver. Driving on that slick \Rdirt\S track, you have to
have finesse, you have to have that real fine feel of the throttle
and feel of the steering wheel. I believe that's a good indication
for a serious Indy-car driver. She's going to be a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher aced her IRL rookie test at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on
Sept. 1. She then came to TMS in September, logging more than 300
laps in her first extensive time in an IRL car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it came a lot quicker than I thought,'' Fisher said of
the offer to ride IRL. ``I thought I would have to be in Midget
cars three or four years to come to this level. But Mr. Pelfrey was
kind enough and had enough guts, I guess, to put someone of my sort
in his cars. It has taken me by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first official day of IRL practice did not come without
problems. After a best lap of 213.169 mph during the first practice
session yesterday, Fisher's crew found something wrong with her
engine. And that meant that Fisher spent the second practice
session sitting on tires, while her crew, including her father,
changed the engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car was running very good, and it felt extremely
comfortable,'' Fisher said. ``But then the engine started missing
at the very end of the straightaway. We came back in, and the guys
saw a bunch of fuel coming off the left bank. They were looking at
it, and they found a cracked \Rcylinder\S head on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the engine trouble, Fisher said she was looking for a
top-10 qualifying run today, but that could be doubtful now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal for today is to get a good run in,'' Fisher said.
``Sunday I want to get in a lot of laps. I realize there is a
championship race going on, and I would not want to affect that. If
I see that I am holding them up, of course I will get out of the
way. But if I am not, I am going to race with them. That is what
racing is all about.'' nn

GOODYEAR FASTEST IN PRACTICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Scott Goodyear needs every point he can muster in
his long-shot bid for the 1999 Pep Boys Indy Racing League
championship. Judging by yesterday's practices, Goodyear has a car
fully capable of winning the pole position during qualifications
today for the Mall.com 500.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear hot-lapped the 1.5-mile Texas Motor Speedway in 24.245
seconds//216.045 mph to top a list of 27 drivers practicing for
tomorrow's season finale on a hot and sometimes windy afternoon.
Goodyear's speed topped Mark Dismore's pole record of 215.272 mph,
set for the Longhorn 500 here in June.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was not run during official qualifying, Goodyear's
speed is not a record. But it certainly indicated that the Canadian
is ready to challenge points leader Greg Ray of Plano for the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the fastest in practice, and that's good,'' said
Goodyear, one of six drivers eligible to claim the Pep Boys Million
bonus as champion. ``We need to get some points in qualifying and
then we need to run a good race.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear trails Ray by 48 points (255-207). A maximum of 55
points is available to any one driver this weekend: 50 for the
victory; 3 for winning the pole, 2 for the outside pole and 1 for
the No. 3 position. Two points also will go to the driver who leads
the most laps on race day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran both qualifying and race setups, and the car is really
working good,'' said Goodyear, driver of the No. 4 Pennzoil G
Force//Aurora. ``We usually make an engine change for qualifying,
but I think we'll leave everything just as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sharp, fourth in points with 209, was second-fastest
overall at 215.627 mph in the No. 8 Delphi Automotive Systems
Dallara//Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Schmidt, third in points at 225, was fourth-fastest at
214.444 in the No. 99 Sprint PCS-Mall.com G Force Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who leads reigning series champion Kenny Brack by 13
points, posted the eighth-fastest lap, 213.395 mph, in his backup
No. 2 Glidden-Menards Dallara//Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   Brack was 19th on the chart at 211.730 mph in the No. 14 A.J.
Foyt Power Team Racing G Force Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   And Buddy Lazier, sixth in points with 204, placed 20th after a
top lap of 211.611 mph in the No. 91 Delta Faucets-Coors Light
Dallara/Aurora. LOOKING AT WINSTON CUP
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Racing Team founder Tom Kelley said yesterday that if it
makes business sense, he and Delphi Automotive Systems might take a
shot at Winston Cup racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be profitable for Delphi, and if they are
interested in any other venue and it makes sense, we'll give it a
shot,'' Kelley said. ``But my goal is to win Indy races and to win
the points championship in Indy, and I would not want anything to
get in the way of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley made his remarks after a news conference announcing an
extension through 2001 of Delphi's sponsorship of Kelley driver
Scott Sharp. Sharp's contract also has been extended to 2001.
Delphi will also be an associate sponsor of Kelley Racing's other
driver, Mark Dismore.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said Winston Cup racing is one of several ideas he and
Delphi have talked about.
</P>
<P>
   ``If at some point we decide we are interested in other racing
venues, we'd like to keep everything in the Delphi family,'' Kelley
said. ``Right now, everything is exploratory. My main focus is on
IRL races.'' nn

BAR RAISED FOR BURN'S POSTSEASON PERFORMANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once again, the Dallas Burn's season came down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike last season when the team was struggling just to make
the playoffs, this season's team was in contention for the Major
League Soccer Western Conference title and home-field advantage up
to the final weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After a tight battle for positioning, a 2-1 victory Sunday
against the Tampa Bay Mutiny secured home-field advantage for the
Burn as the West's second-place team. Game 1 of the first round is
4 p.m. today against defending MLS champion Chicago at the Cotton
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn experienced a late-season surge highlighted by several
team records: the most victories (19) and points (51) in a season
and fewest goals allowed (35). The Burn also won a
team-record-tying five consecutive games and eight of its last
nine, entering the playoffs as the hottest team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   All of which raises the bar for the team. In 1997, Dallas
advanced to the Western Conference finals, but hasn't made it past
the first round any other season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at past success, and brush it off and look
for the future and shoot for the stars,'' defender Brandon Pollard
said. ``That's definitely been a problem with teams of the past, of
being complacent and resting on the successes of the early part of
the season, and then we dive down toward the end of the season.
This year we've been running strong the whole time. I think it's
some of the best soccer we can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the team can continue that way is the bigger question.
Certainly, last season's playoff results _ deflating losses to Los
Angeles, 6-1 in the first game and 3-2 in the second after a 2-0
Burn lead _ provide some degree of motivation.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn's group of newcomers is expected to play a major role.
Rookie goalkeeper Matt Jordan has had a superb season, with a
league-record 11 shutouts and team-record 1.08 goals-against
average. Forward Bobby Rhine is a constant threat on offense. The
addition of Ecuadorian striker Ariel Graziani was a pivotal move
for the Burn. Graziani's four goals in his first four games helped
the team break out of a minor slump.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Sergi Daniv and his dribbling skills are another
spark for the Burn. Daniv is listed as day-to-day because of a knee
injury. There are other options _ Paul Broome and Kirk Wilson _ who
can step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as important is the guys who haven't played as much,''
forward Jason Kreis said. ``What they're doing for the team is
really pushing our starting players to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreis is on course for league most valuable player after scoring
18 goals and adding 18 assists, and captain Richard Farrer has
anchored an ever-steady defense.
</P>
<P>
   Both old and new talent has meshed impressively in the regular
season. Now is the time to find out if they can come together for a
run at the MLS Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I've said all along, we've had better players, but we've
never had a group of guys that's better together,'' Burn coach Dave
Dir said. ``But our biggest goal is yet to come. We have to make
sure all our hard work isn't for nothing.''

ROUSH STILL FUMING OVER POINTS PENALTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Maybe this will rekindle Jack Roush's
interest in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Roush driver Greg Biffle's second-place finish in the O'Reilly
300 at Texas Motor Speedway last night gave him 3,588 points,
allowing him to unofficially reclaim the lead in the driver's
championship by 21 points over Jack Sprague. With only the season
finale, Oct. 30 at the California Speedway, remaining, Roush is
poised to claim his first NASCAR championship.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, however, Roush still was fuming about the
points penalty that put a crimp in Biffle's championship chances.
</P>
<P>
   And how mad was Jack?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack doesn't care about a truck championship,'' Roush said
during a national teleconference. ``I don't think I'll ever care
about a truck championship. I can't imagine what they \RNASCAR\S
would say or what they would do after what they've done that would
rekindle the fire in me to let me want to go win a truck
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't bear the thought about not being able to win a
championship because of what happened at Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   Biffle posted a series-record ninth victory in The Orleans 250
at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on Sept. 24. But during a postrace
inspection of Biffle's truck, NASCAR deemed the engine intake
manifold an ``unapproved part.'' Crew chief Randy Goss subsequently
was fined $46,800, and 120 points were lopped off Biffle's lead.
What would have been a 130-point advantage over Sprague was reduced
to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Roush appealed the penalty, contending the manifold in the No.
50 Grainger Ford had been run on eight occasions this season.
Biffle said the manifold was on the engine when he won at Michigan
Speedway, in addition to Vegas. But the National Stock Car
Commission sided with the sanctioning body last week, even after an
elaborate polygraph demonstration by Roush Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague moved past Biffle into first by 24 points after the
Kroger 225 at Louisville (Ky.) Motor Speedway on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as our championship prospects,'' Roush said, ``I've
been racing with NASCAR for 12 years now, and I've never been more
disgusted or disappointed or frustrated in my life, in the NASCAR
sense. This is the second time we've been in contention for a
championship ... and had a rules action by NASCAR in an area that
wasn't clear, come back and take us out of contention.''
</P>
<P>
   Roush was referring to the 1990 Winston Cup championship between
his ace, Mark Martin, and Dale Earnhardt. Martin had 46 points
deducted from his total after NASCAR officials said the carburetor
spacer plate on his car was 21/2 inches high, or one-half-inch too
thick. Earnhardt subsequently won the title by 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   Roush said the latest episode had driven him crazy. ``Absolutely
bonkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Biffle said he felt NASCAR did not study all the facts, and that
his team's integrity had been besmirched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand, and my team understands, \Rthe manifold\S is not
the reason we've won all these races _ or that race, or the
Michigan race,'' Biffle said. ``We won because of pit stops; we won
because of the team we are and the driver I am. That's what won the
races.'' nn

   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan _ If there is such a thing as a good coup,
this one is winning raves in the bazaars of Rawalpindi.
</P>
<P>
   A decade of crooked and incompetent civilian rule before the
takeover this week, a decade of competently brutal dictatorship
before that, and life keeps getting harder for Pakistan's 138
million souls. A Pakistani poet, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, once was asked
what would become of his nation. ``My great fear,'' he said, ``is
that nothing will happen. Things will go on the way they are.''
</P>
<P>
   There is not much passion for politicians or for going to the
polls again. There is a thirst for leadership, or even something
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there should be any elections,'' said Kalsoon
Syed, an elementary school principal. ``There should be a strong
dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   The American ambassador, William Milam, met Friday for 90
minutes with the coup leader, Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, at the army's
general headquarters here just hours after the general declared
himself the country's chief executive, suspended the Constitution
and dismissed Parliament. The general's government also froze the
assets of more than 500 political figures, among them Nawaz Sharif,
the ousted prime minister, and his predecessor, Benazir Bhutto. A
U.S. Embassy spokesman said the ambassador had given the general a
message from President Clinton calling on him to return the nation
to civilian rule as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be calling for a return to democratic principles in
Pakistan, but politicians here have rarely practiced them. For 11
years, since the end of the last military dictatorship, most of
them have behaved like medieval barons, plundering most of what
remained of the nation's wealth.
</P>
<P>
   What was left was not enough to run a civil society. The
principal export of Pakistan today is Pakistanis. The most
talented, the best educated, the potential leaders are gone. So
nostalgia for a strongman fills the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling may support the military government of Musharraf,
who seized power this week, becoming the latest in a series of
rulers who have led and misled the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan was created in 1947 out of the violent partition of
India. While it often has been ruled by military dictatorships, it
has also had the trappings of democracy: a Parliament, a lively
press, political debate.
</P>
<P>
   But to many Pakistanis, democracy is a facade. Waheed Zaman, 30,
the well-spoken owner of a trophy shop in Rawalpindi, said his
middle-class family was ``like other people; we are fed up with
politicians; we have love for our armed forces despite their
checkered history.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaman and others in the teeming bazaar in this city, 25 miles
southwest of the national capital, Islamabad, spoke in heroic terms
of a man who was once a national demon: Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.
He ruled Pakistan for 11 years until he died in a plane crash in
1988, a still unexplained midair explosion that also took the life
of Arnold Raphel, then the American ambassador to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Zia was an angel,'' said a grizzled rickshaw driver
named Amir Khan, 59. ``Then there was no inflation. Crime was under
control. When I heard he was killed, I thought Pakistan was an
orphan.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is sometimes tinged with blood; many Pakistanis
want their political miscreants punished. ``These smugglers, these
bribe-taking people should be behind bars or hanged,'' said Mrs.
Syed, the school principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pervaiz Musharraf, my prayers and my best wishes are with
him,'' she said. ``This man is a general. He knows law and order
and how to get things done. We expect him to do things for the
common people.''
</P>
<P>
   Much needs to be done. Pakistan is a basket case, and the coup
may make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   Today two-thirds of the country's wealth goes to the military
and to paying its debts. Three-quarters of the aid Pakistan
receives from the International Monetary Fund goes to pay off IOUs
to the I.M.F. That aid was immediately suspended after the coup, as
was a trade agreement with the European Union that Pakistan
desperately needed. Pakistan has only $1.4 billion in foreign
reserves _ just enough to buy three weeks of imports.
</P>
<P>
   In the troubled 2{-year tenure of Sharif, Pakistan's currency,
the rupee, lost half its value against the dollar. Everything in
the bazaar seems to cost far more than it did in 1997. And the $600
million in annual military and economic aid Pakistan received from
the United States in Zia's day, during the 1980s, ended after he
died and when the Cold War was over, blocked by law after the
United States acknowledged that Pakistan was building a nuclear
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is now uneasily contemplating the prospect of dealing
with a dictator in Pakistan once more. Western diplomats said the
general had given Milam a preview of the speech he is to give on
Saturday, which those diplomats expect will set forth his plans for
dealing with Pakistan's crushing problems.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans may include a slow return to what the West would
like to call democracy. It may come, but for now the bazaar has
spoken, and in much the same voice as that of Talat Massoud, a
retired lieutenant general who served as defense secretary from
1988 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coup was a good thing,'' he said, in a voice devoid of
happiness or anticipation. ``It gave us a sigh of relief. There was
no choice left for the military. Our politicians put us on the
brink of disaster. They were making a mockery of democracy. The
prime minister had corrupted every institution. The judiciary was
bought off; there was no justice. The police were run as a fiefdom.
What kind of democracy was that?''

CHIPPER JONES GOES ON THE DEFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (Previously skedded as BBN-BRAVES-JONES)

 By   STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chipper Jones tried to be philosophical about his
return to Shea Stadium. After all, he has had a quiet series. His
normally dangerous bat had been held in check and his glove had
failed him, too. There were more visible targets for New York Mets
fans to pick on, his teammate John Rocker being the most notorious.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the Atlanta Braves lined up along the third-base
line for pregame introductions Friday night, it was Jones, along
with Rocker, who incurred the wrath of the crowd. Boos rained down
from the sold-out crowd. Signs scattered through the stands, almost
every one referring to him by his given name, Larry.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he did little to alienate the fans with words or
actions on this day, the same as he had in the first two games, the
taunts continued every time he surfaced. And as they had in the
first two games, the Braves were able to continue to thwart the
Mets without the production of Jones, taking a 1-0 decision and a
3-0 lead in the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   At the plate, the Mets have been determined not to let Jones
beat them, walking him five times in his eight trips to the plate
over the first two games and holding him hitless in the three times
that he was able to swing the bat. Friday night, Jones finally got
a hit, but was erased as he tried to stretch a routine single to
left into a double, being thrown out at second base easily by
Rickey Henderson. On the night, he was 1 for 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were able to manufacture a run in the first inning
thanks to the Mets' miscues and no thanks to Jones, who popped out
to second with two runners on and nobody out. He is 4 for 21
without an extra-base hit in the postseason this season, an oddity
because he entered this year with a .323 career batting average in
the postseason and seven home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Even more curious was that the Mets finally found a way around
Jones. In the regular season, he batted .400 against them with
seven home runs and 16 runs batted in, the biggest damage coming in
the Braves' three-game sweep of the Mets in Atlanta from September
21 to 23, when he hit four home runs.
</P>
<P>
   But it is his fielding that was concerning Jones as the series
shifted to New York. He had an error in the opening game,
mishandling a line drive by Shawon Dunston, who eventually came
around to score in the ninth inning, cutting the deficit to 4-2.
Then in Game 2, Jones allowed Melvin Mora's grounder to slip under
his glove, and this time Mora came around to score to cut the
Braves' advantage to 4-3, the final score.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, Rocker was able to shut the door and make up for
Jones miscues, which is why Rocker's comments about the fans at
Shea Stadium were expected to draw more venom than Jones' words.
Jones was hard enough on himself though. ``I'm not frustrated at
the plate,'' he said. ``I'm frustrated out in the field a little
bit. I should be playing better defense. I took a lot of extra
ground balls. Hopefully, I'll start feeling more comfortable out
there. ``It's a little bit of inconsistent hops, a little bit of
bad play on my part. Fielding is as much feel as hitting is. When
you don't feel comfortable out there you get yourself in trouble. I
think I was probably lucky to only make one error in that first
game. (Wednesday's) could have really cost us the game. I want to
prepare myself so that doesn't happen again.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jones spent extra time during Thursday's workout at Shea Stadium
working on his fielding, hoping to change his fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just go out there and the same thing that is always baseball
related,'' he said. ``Repetition, repetition, repetition. Do it
over and over again until you start to feel comfortable again.
Hopefully, get some better hops, some more routine plays, and some
better concentration.''

ON BASEBALL: LEITER SHARP, BUT NOT SHARP ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Leiter performed as advertised Friday night, but
his effort wasn't enough to propel the New York Mets toward that
Subway Series all New York awaits. It's highly unlikely that the
Double S train, the Series Special, will stop at Shea Stadium
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The way Leiter has pitched in critical games for the Mets
recently, they might have said that they had the Atlanta Braves
right where they wanted them. The Braves led in the National League
Championship Series, 2-0, but Leiter was working and who better to
have on the mound than the big-game left-hander?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a big-game pitcher all year,'' Mike Piazza, his
catcher, said before the game. ``At this point of the year there's
no reason why it should change. He's the guy we want out there. I
believe he can go out and throw a good game. Then Rick Reed can
follow up and throw a great game and we can even the series.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter lived up to the billing Piazza gave him. He allowed only
a first-inning run, unearned at that, and three singles in seven
innings. But unlike his recent big-game starts, this one ended as a
loss, 1-0, because Tom Glavine, the Braves' left-hander, didn't
give up even an unearned run in his seven-inning stint.
</P>
<P>
   Aided immensely by outfield throws that caught runners at home
(once) and at second base (twice), Leiter effectively shut down the
Braves. His teammates, however, could not produce a tying run, let
alone enough runs to win and avoid going into Saturday night's game
with the chance that their year could end abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of this game last September where I was facing Tommy
and I pitched a complete game and gave up a run,'' Leiter related
afterward. ``Mike hit a two-run homer and we won, 2-1. While I was
envisioning that, I was picturing one of those guys, somebody,
hitting that two-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   He was drawing that mental picture from about the fifth inning
on, Leiter said, but the Mets had only four players reach base in
the final five innings, only two on hits. Piazza, Benny Agbayani
and Melvin Mora each hit fly balls to deep parts of the outfield,
but none of the shots traveled far enough to duplicate the game on
the big screen in Leiter's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, who gave the Florida Marlins a gutty performance in Game
7 of the 1997 World Series, did not have a terrific season for the
Mets this year. He finished with a 13-12 record and 4.23 earned run
average.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent 11-day span he beat the Braves and halted a
seven-game Mets' losing streak, pitched a two-hit shutout against
Cincinnati in the playoff for the wild-card spot and positioned the
Mets for this series with another strong performance in the final
game of the division series against the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's elevated his game,'' Piazza said. ``He's a lot more
aggressive. I think the times he hasn't thrown well this year he's
been tentative. A lot of times this year he didn't trust his stuff
and believe that he had the stuff to get guys out. He was going out
almost pitching not to get hit, instead of saying here's my best
stuff, hit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an attitude you have to have. It's a frame of mind.
You've seen the last three, four games. He's gone out there and
said here's my best stuff. He hasn't been walking guys. He hasn't
fallen behind. When he has, he's like, hey, I'm not going to feel
like I've got to make the perfect pitch. I'm going to trust my
stuff. He's been getting guys to do what they're supposed to do
with his pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Mets and their pitcher, it wasn't one of
his pitches that did them in. It was his errant toss to John Olerud
at first base.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, who has worked extra hard to avoid the first-inning
problems he used to have regularly, walked the game's leadoff
hitter, Gerald Williams, then fielded Bret Boone's bouncer in front
of the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing how fast Gerald Williams is, my thought process was I
was just going to get the out at first,'' Leiter said, explaining
the play that went awry. ``But I glanced at second and I easily
could have gotten him. I think it was that hesitance of looking
there and saying why aren't I throwing to second.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he saw enough distance between Williams and second,
Leiter said, he decided not to throw there because of Williams'
speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took a look there was, I don't know, 20 feet and I
still didn't throw,'' he said. ``It was a total brain cramp. And by
not taking my time and crow-hopping and making my strike to Johnny,
I kinda grenaded it over there. I rushed the throw. It was poor,
poor. It's just upsetting to think that's the difference between a
win and a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   One batter and one out later, Williams and Boone broke on a
pitch to Brian Jordan, trying a double steal. Piazza opted to throw
to second to get Boone, but his throw was higher than Leiter's had
been and sailed into center field. Williams scampered all the way
home, and his run would turn out to be the only run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beat myself up in the dugout over the throwing error after
the inning,'' Leiter said, ``but I said to myself, that's it. One
run, keep them there and I'll take my chances. But Tommy Glavine
was his usual stellar self.''
</P>
<P>
   After Leiter beat the Yankees in June and ended the Mets'
eight-game losing streak, the Mets won four games in a row and
turned their season around. One game after he beat the Braves late
last month, the Mets went on a four-game winning streak and landed
in the postseason. Now that's what they need to make that Subway
Series possible _ a four-game winning streak in the remaining games
of this series.

`MCBEAL' TV SHOW PROVES TO BE AN ALLY FOR VONDA SHEPARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - When Ally McBeal won an Emmy award as Best Comedy, the
happy cast celebrated into the night.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 the next morning, they all were back at work.
</P>
<P>
   Fame is fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   But for Vonda Shepard, the singer who often closes an Ally
segment with a performance at the law firm's favorite watering
hole, fame has been a long time coming and now is rewarding her
with a six-year TV contract, recording opportunities and weekend
concerts across the country.
</P>
<P>
   For her good fortune, Shepard thanks David E. Kelley, producer
of Ally McBeal and The Practice, which earned him another Emmy this
year for Best Drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took everything I've been working toward and found an
avenue for it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his talent, critical acclaim and marriage to celebrated
actress Michelle Pfeiffer, Kelley is no James Cameron, immodestly
proclaiming himself King of the World for his work, Shepard says
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so sweet and soulful,'' she says of the man who still
thinks of himself as an ``underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's role as a club singer on Ally McBeal was no act of
charity, however. She's paid her dues.
</P>
<P>
   A recording artist since the age of 10, she has been playing
clubs since she was 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in an unusual family,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother left the family when Shepard was about 9, and the
girl began writing songs and poems to vent her heartache. It's
still a common theme in her compositions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an introspective child,'' she says. ``It probably saved
me . . . It's like an alchemy; you can turn pain into a song.''
</P>
<P>
   Although her mother never returned home, she and Shepard have
reconciled and now enjoy a close relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Richmond Shepard, was a mime, director and writer
who had contacts in the entertainment and recording industries.
Vonda studied piano from age 6 and began voice lessons at 16. She
no longer takes lessons but works on her sultry voice every day.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her work for Ally McBeal is done in the recording
studio. Songs are then lip-synced when the TV show is filmed to
obtain the best sound and preserve Shepard's voice if a take must
be filmed over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Filming usually begins around 7:30 a.m. _ not prime time for a
singer to be belting out the blues.
</P>
<P>
   For group songfests, the cast comes to the studio and prerecords
the music.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley selects all the songs for Ally, and they often reflect
his baby boomer tastes _ ``Hooked on a Feeling,'' ``It's in His
Kiss (The Shoop Shoop Song),'' ``End of the World,'' ``I Only Want
to Be With You.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, 36, said she likes the old songs, too. She's recorded
one Ally McBeal soundtrack CD and is planning a sequel.
</P>
<P>
   When she finds the time.
</P>
<P>
   By 7:30, a CD of her own music, was her first album since Songs
From Ally McBeal, which went platinum last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Before Songs, she had recorded three solo records: Vonda
Shepard, The Radical Light and It's Good, Eve.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latter record, released in 1996, that caught Kelley's
ear and convinced him to sign her for Ally McBeal.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard met Pfeiffer 15 years ago and had kept in touch through
her marriage to Kelley seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although Shepard had worked steadily on her music for many
years, recording and touring with such stars as Rickie Lee Jones
and Jackson Browne, she despaired of getting her big break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would never come,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A recording contract with Warner Bros. Records at age 24 seemed
fated to be her only break.
</P>
<P>
   Then Kelley, putting together his concept for Ally, decided he
wanted a singer to express the young lawyer's feelings. Mindful of
Shepard's work, she says, ``he realized I was the voice he was
looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she says, ``this is huge. This is it.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a ``huge'' star, however, leaves her little time to laze
by the pool or soak up the California sun. When she's not in the
recording studio or on the TV set, she's spending weekends on the
road doing one-night concerts that will get her back to the office
by Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Single, she's free to concentrate on her career and put plans
for pool-lazing in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to know that that time will come again,'' she says,
while focusing on this point in her career when ``everything is
exploding.''
</P>
<P>
   After she finishes this tour promoting By 7:30, she plans to
take time off from concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard is eager to play the Scottsdale Center for the Arts
Amphitheater, where the acoustics might not be as impeccable as an
indoor concert hall but the aesthetics are pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like nature,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls with some dismay, however, her last outdoor concert
in Arizona. It was at Blockbuster Desert Sky Pavilion. She was
touring with Jackson Browne. It was August, and the heat nearly got
the best of her.
</P>
<P>
   During her one break, she had to cool off, on the verge of
fainting.
</P>
<P>
   A November concert under the stars should be kinder. &QL;

SECOND LINE DELIVERS FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ The Kings went back on the road Friday night
and this time they brought along their second line.
</P>
<P>
   After being held without a point in the Kings' five-game trip to
open the season, the line of Bryan Smolinski, Donald Audette and
Glen Murray scored two goals in a 4-1 victory over the Calgary
Flames.
</P>
<P>
   Although Marko Tuomainen blew the game open with a goal midway
through the third period, it was the play of the second line that
was most gratifying for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got it,'' said an excited Audette, whose third-period goal
broke the back of the netting. ``We've been working hard. It was
bound to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the team had gone 3-1-1 on the first leg of their
seven-game season-opening trip, the second line had not joined in
the fun. When the team returned to Los Angeles for five days of
practice, that unit was aiming to turn its many chances into goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say we were getting teased about it,'' said
Smolinski, who had the game's first goal and added an assist on
Audette's blast in the third. ``Everyone wants us to do well. If a
team is going to win it needs production from the second unit. You
can't leave it up to just the first line no matter how well they've
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The first unit, which includes NHL player of the week Luc
Robitaille, had an off night, although Ziggy Palffy hit the post
twice. They managed just five shots on Flames veteran goalie Grant
Fuhr.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is going to happen,'' Kings rookie coach Andy Murray
said. ``The important thing is to see how the rest of the group
responds.''
</P>
<P>
   It also was important because the Kings move on to Edmonton
tonight for the second of back-to-back games. For the Kings, who
will host the first sporting event at the Staples Center on
Wednesday against Boston, Edmonton marks the final stop on a
season-opening stretch of seven games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first goal when I took this job was to still have it by the
time we got home,'' Murray said with a laugh. ``Last summer there
were a lot of people who weren't so sure I would. This game was
close and well-played until we got some goals at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flames have just one victory, but they were coming off a tie
with Carolina and a victory over previously unbeaten Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski, a right winger acquired from the New York Islanders
in the Palffy deal, had 31 goals for Boston during the 1993-94
season and added 28 for the Islanders in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless first period, the Kings took a 1-0 lead on his
long-awaited first goal at 5:52 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   From the left point, defenseman Aki Berg swung the puck to
Audette behind the Calgary goal. Audette passed in front to
Smolinski, who poked it past Fuhr for the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was great,'' Smolinski said. ``Berg made a great play
getting it to Donald. I'm not sure he was passing right for my
stick, but I knew I was going to get a crack at the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, the Flames tied the game on a goal by Bill
Lindsay with assists from Jeff Shantz and Travis Brigley, his first
NHL point. Lindsay beat Kings goalie Stephane Fiset, who stopped 27
shots.
</P>
<P>
   But this one belonged to the Kings, who kept pressure on Fuhr. A
Rob Blake goal on a blast from the point was ruled off with 13:30
in the second when Palffy knocked down Fuhr in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes later, Garry Galley took the same shot.
This time the puck sailed through traffic and off the skate of
defenseman Tommy Albein.
</P>
<P>
   But the most dramatic goal came midway through the third on
Audette's 15-foot slap shot on Fuhr. The puck sailed over Fuhr's
right shoulder and ripped the net before sailing out.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Rob Shick ruled no goal, but replays reversed the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew right away that it was in,'' he said. ``This was a good
night for everyone. We had been working hard all season. Tonight it
paid off.''

AT FOX, THE GAME IS `GREED' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Leave it to the Fox Network to boil the game show down
to its most basic element: Greed.
</P>
<P>
   That's both the name of and idea behind the prime-time show Fox
is trotting out Nov. 4 (if all goes as planned), just in time for
fall sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   Given the propensity for television networks to glom onto an
idea and beat it to death (three biblical movies this season; three
Partridge Family movies, for goodness' sake?), it was a given after
the success of ABC's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire that a steady
stream of prime-time game shows would soon come barreling down the
pike. But Fox is raising the stakes _ Greed's biggest prize could
top $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it wouldn't be Fox if there wasn't a
lowest-common-denominator twist. While a team of five contestants
will help each other answer multiple-choice questions in the first
round of Greed, in later rounds, they can turn on each other in an
attempt to keep the loot for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At least cars don't crash and wild animals don't attack. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're inspired by the success of Millionaire,'' Mike
Darnell, Fox's executive vice president for special programming
(such as car crashes and animal attacks), said in a conference call
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that game shows now have a place in prime time. We're
hoping that's true. It seems that every major network is working on
something, and we felt a need to: (A) get out there as fast as
possible and (B) we think that by the time there's five or six of
these on the air, they won't be as special. So we're hoping that by
being second in the market, we can still make an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   A Fox impact, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that there was an edgy Fox version of those types of
things,'' Darnell said. ``That's why: (A) the title Greed and (B)
the idea that in addition to playing the game and having fun with
the questions, you could also within the game be greedy, make a
decision and actually play against your own teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   The way he answered questions, it sounds as if Darnell is: (A)
deep into game-show mode and (B) having trouble getting out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has ordered six half-hour shows, which will air either in
three one-hour segments or six half-hour ones. The low-rated Family
Guy and Action will be pre-empted; Action returns Dec. 2 at 8:30
p.m. on Thursdays. Family Guy will land somewhere else on the
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, things are a bit murky. Fox wouldn't say who the
host will be, and getting Darnell and Dick Clark, whose Dick Clark
Productions came up with the show, to describe how Greed will be
played was like trying to find a gray hair in Clark's well-coifed
mane.
</P>
<P>
   Clark sounded more than a little worried that another network
would steal his idea; thus, a sampling of his responses:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to educate the people down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How much do you want to educate the other three networks?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fellow down the street listening very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the cloak-and-dagger concerns, Darnell did spell out
in general how Greed will work.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round, the five contestants answer a series of
multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty; the team
captain decides whether they go forward, and each teammate answers
a successive question. For the first question, there are three
possible answers, for the second, four, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The next rounds are sort of like a cannibalistic Family Feud _
each contestant attempts to name four items in a list of six, then
seven, then eight, then nine, all progressively difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that juncture, they can all work as a team, they can elect
to stay together,'' Clark said. ``(A contestant) can take over, (a
contestant) can take control, people can drop by the wayside for
prizes _ it's a madhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   If Greed is a success _ and with stiff competition on Thursday
nights, including Millionaire, Darnell said any double-digit share
would qualify _ what's next? Lust? Envy? Pride? Nah. But perhaps a
return of Greed in series form.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, more game shows than you can shake a remote at. &QL;

BRUINS GET TO THE POINT IN DALLAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ They were desperate, unbelievably desperate. As badly
as coach Pat Burns had tried to keep his troops on an even keel, as
hard as he had tried to keep practice upbeat and keep his players
from being discouraged, it was clear the team's 0-4-2 start was
wearing on all of them.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Bruins' worst start since 1964-65 and the players
were trying to put a happy face on a rough situation, saying all
they needed was a victory.
</P>
<P>
   At practice Thursday, Burns had challenged his players to be
better, especially the forwards on the top two lines.
Friday &UR;  &LR; night, against the defending Stanley Cup champion Dallas
Stars at Reunion Arena, they were.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was only good enough for a 2-2 tie, although a
hard-earned one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team was playing so well. It always makes it harder (to
end in a tie),'' said goaltender Rob Tallas, who saw only eight
shots in the first 40 minutes. ``I just told myself to have fun out
there. I kept saying that to myself over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas, who was making his first start in four games, had 21
saves against the Stanley Cup champions. ``It's been nine days, and
that's a hard nine days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Stars just 2:07 to get on the board. Mike Modano had
been pulled off the top line after a disappointing outing against
the Sharks on Wednesday night. The new combination of Jere
Lehtinen, Brett Hull, and Pavel Patera combined for Dallas's
strike. Patera centered a pass for Lehtinen, who banged home a shot
from in front.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins took some time to score, but it wasn't for a lack of
opportunity as they put tremendous pressure on the Stars. At 5:32,
Dave Andreychuk's blast trickled through the legs of Ed Belfour,
but the Dallas goalie was able to recover and keep the puck from
going over the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:14, left wing Sergei Samsonov, who had been singled out by
coach Pat Burns as needing to bear down, nearly scored on his shot
from the right point.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' top defensive line was again very effective at both
ends of the ice with left wing P.J. Axelsson firing a shot off the
post at 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Heinze, another forward who had been struggling, had a
tailor-made chance when he took a centering pass from Joe Thornton
and one-timed it, but the goalie turned it back. The most
impressive save Belfour made was on Samsonov. With 2:16 left,
Samsonov had a point-blank chance that Belfour somehow got his
glove on.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the period, the Bruins had a 17-5 shot advantage.
Although they trailed, 1-0, they were clearly carrying the play.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Ray Bourque tied the game at 10:41 with his second
goal of the season. Jason Allison was battling down low for the
puck when Samsonov grabbed it and began putting on a show. He
finally dished the puck up to Bourque at the point, and he blasted
it past Belfour to pull Boston even.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins continued to keep the heat on, taking a 2-1 lead on
the power play at 17:44. Allison relayed a pass up to Bourque, who
rapped a one-timer that glanced off the glove of Andreychuk in
front of the net, and past Belfour. It was Andreychuk's third goal
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, in their hungriest game of the year, outshot Dallas,
13-3, in the second period, and held a 30-8 shot advantage through
40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But as hard as they tried to hold the lead, they couldn't. The
dangerous Stars came out firing in the third period, outshooting
Boston, 14-3. Modano, reunited with Lehtinen and Hull, scored the
tying goal off the rush at 14:16 with his linemates assisting.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars continued swarming the Boston net with Tallas forced
to make some very tough saves. Tallas got a little help from the
left post when defenseman Richard Matvichuk rapped a shot from the
left circle off the post with 24.7 seconds left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some tough saves. I'm pleased with my
performance,'' said Tallas. ``I just wanted to be given a chance to
play.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now they're going to have to be truly Amazin.'
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets, who after Friday &UR;  &LR; night's 1-0 defeat to Tom
Glavine and the Atlanta Braves have lost all three games in the
best-of-seven National League Championship Series, must make like a
hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   In all of major league pro sports, only two teams _ the 1975 New
York Islanders and 1943 Toronto Maple Leafs _ have come back from a
3-0 deficit to win a playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets will send Rick Reed to the mound Saturday night against
John Smoltz to start their quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some hope,'' said New York manager Bobby Valentine.
``It's a long shot, no doubt about that. But we're going to show up
and try and play one game at a time and see how close we get.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the Mets have had no problem coming close. But close
hasn't been good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Friday &UR;  &LR; night's loss was the first 1-0 NLCS game since Oct. 16,
1992. The Braves won that one behind Steve Avery, who had two 1-0
wins in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets gave this one away in unusual fashion in the first
inning when they made two errors _ the first time all season they
had made two in one frame.
</P>
<P>
   The timing could not have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had base runners in each of Glavine's seven innings but
were never able to bunch their hits to produce a run. Glavine
allowed seven hits but walked only one and struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was just excellent,'' said Atlanta manager Bobby
Cox. ``He just really moved the ball around, changed speeds good,
and went inside good and just did a super job.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Glavine: ``It was a little bit of everything. The key for
me tonight, as it usually is, was that I worked ahead in the count
and was able to spot my pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Remlinger and John Rocker each tossed one hitless inning in
relief to close out the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did threaten against Rocker in the ninth. Leadoff
hitter Benny Agbayani reached on an error by shortstop Walt Weiss,
but Rocker struck out Todd Pratt, who was hitting for Robin
Ventura. Melvin Mora was retired on a fly to center, and Rey
Ordonez then hit a grounder up the middle to Weiss, who stepped on
second for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   The Shea Stadium crowd of 55,911 quieted instantly. And Rocker
let out a whoop.
</P>
<P>
   Mets starter Al Leiter allowed only three hits in seven innings,
but one of his three walks and those two first-inning errors _ one
his own _ did him in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al certainly matched Tommy pitch for pitch,'' Cox said. ``I
thought he pitched one hell of a ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a wasted night for the Mets. They wasted Mike Piazza's
first two hits of the series. They wasted a pair of hits from Mora,
making his first start of the postseason. They wasted Leiter's
shoulda-been-enough pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets never recovered from their first-inning woes as Leiter,
with the help of Piazza, buried himself. Atlanta's Gerald Williams
worked his way back from a 1-and-2 count and walked. Bret Boone hit
back to the mound, and Leiter looked to second base but decided to
go to first. His throw was high and wide, however, and drew John
Olerud off the base.
</P>
<P>
   After Chipper Jones popped out, Williams and Boone took off on a
double steal. And Piazza, trying to get Boone, chucked the ball
into center field, allowing Williams to score and Boone to go to
third.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan then flied to center, and Mora threw a strike to
the plate as Boone tagged. Boone bowled into Piazza, but the
catcher held the ball for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   But the damage had been done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought that run would cost us the game,'' said
Valentine. ``I felt we would score today.''

 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deja vu hit Tom Glavine before Friday &UR;  &LR; night's Game 3
of the National League Championship Series began. The Atlanta
Braves lefthander from Billerica, Mass., thought about entering the
game against the New York Mets with a 2-0 advantage, and how
similar that was to the 1996 World Series, when Atlanta entered
Game 3 ahead of the New York Yankees, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Glavine pitched well, going seven innings, giving up
two runs, and striking out eight. But the Yankees, led by David
Cone, pitched better, and Glavine left trailing, 2-1. The Yankees
the game, 5-2, and went on to capture the next three to stun the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   So Glavine went into Friday &UR;  &LR; night eager to prevent history from
repeating itself, and before he could take the mound the Braves
scored on two errors, the first time the Mets had committed two
miscues in the same inning all season.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, those watching this one knew two things: the
first-inning run was all the cushion Glavine would get, due to a
superb performance by counterpart Al Leiter, and one run was all he
would need.
</P>
<P>
   So much for a repeat of history. Glavine led a charge by Atlanta
by scattering seven hits over seven innings and recording a
personal NLCS-high eight strikeouts. Mike Remlinger and John Rocker
finished up, yielding no hits and striking out one apiece in the
1-0 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Mets are faced with the task of trying to become the
first team in Major League Baseball history to rally from a 3-0
deficit to win a playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine held the Mets in check despite giving up leadoff singles
in the third and fourth innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there were strong similarities between this game and
the one in 1996,'' said Glavine. ``In 1996, it was a tight ballgame
we lost, and I didn't think that any of us foresaw we would lose
the next three after that and it would be the end of the series.
But I approached today's game with that in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference between us standing there 3-0 and
2-1. I knew that and I knew based on what happened in 1996 with the
Yankees that this is still a pivotal game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do everything I could to make sure we would come
out of this with a 3-0 lead, because that's a big difference,
especially with these guys playing in their own building.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest Glavine came to trouble was in the second. With two
outs, Melvin Mora singled to left and Rey Ordonez singled to center
to move Mora to third. The next batter was Leiter, who ran the
count to 3-2, stirring the raucous Mets crowd, before striking out
swinging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I really felt like I needed a third out was when
Rickey Henderson led off with a base hit,'' said Glavine, referring
to the third inning. ``You hate to have him lead off by getting on
base because the stolen base becomes a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets also advanced a runner to third in the fourth inning.
Piazza led off with a single to left, and, after Glavine struck out
Benny Agbayani and Robin Ventura, Mora singled to right as Piazza
moved to third. But Glavine again kept the Mets at bay by getting
Olerud to ground out.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine said the win was personally satisfying because of how he
struggled during the regular season, posting a 14-11 mark, his
lowest win total since the 1994 strike season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good ballgame for me, obviously,'' he said. ``It's
one that I'm pleased with and very proud of. And I'm just happy
that I was able to go out there and make the one run in the first
inning stand up.''

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Oct. 17:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-RUSSIA-ARMSCONTROL (Moscow) _ A look at the state of arms
control. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   TREATY-ASSESS (Washington) _ The humbling of the White House
over the nuclear test ban treaty augurs poorly for President
Clinton being able to secure any crowning foreign policy
achievement in the last year of his term. Indeed, the defeat was so
severe that some administration and congressional officials
wondered if it would prematurely cripple Clinton's authority on
foreign affairs. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-JEWS (Tehran, Iran) _ A chill has spread through the small
Iranian Jewish community since the arrest in March of 13 Jews who
have been accused of spying for Israel. By John F. Burns. (With a
map.)
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN-RDP (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ Pakistan's new military
ruler is promising to give the people what they want _ an end to
the country's chronic corruption. Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf,
Pakistan's self-proclaimed chief executive, who by his own
admission has little political experience, will pledge
``credibility, transparency and accountability in running state
affairs'' in a speech to be delivered Sunday. By Tim Weiner and
Steve LeVine.
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN-POWERPLAY (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ For months,
Pakistan's prime minister and its top general were like two
scorpions in a bottle. Last week, both struck. Their duel
culminated on Tuesday in the cockpit of a Pakistan International
Airlines jet carrying Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf and at least 190 other
passengers to Karachi from Sri Lanka, where the general had been
sent by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to represent Pakistan at a
state celebration. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   CHECHNYA-GEURRILLA (Grozny, Russia) _ Among the ranks of
fierce-looking Chechen fighters, with their grenades and spare
magazines strapped to their chests, there is a man who stands out
as especially fearsome. He goes by the single name of Khattab, and
even among Chechens _ let alone his Russian foes _ he is both hated
and revered. Khattab is an Arab, a self-declared Islamic warrior,
who has come to Chechnya to fight the Russians he first battled in
Afghanistan after the Soviet army occupation in 1979. An interview.
By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   CZECH-GYPSIES (Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic) _ Defying the
appeals of the Czech government, Parliament, President Vaclav Havel
and the European Union, this depressed town in the Rust Belt of
northern Bohemia has built a wall down one street to separate
Czechs from Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-LANGUAGES (Queven, France) _ Reflecting a growing trend
in Europe, a movement is afoot to save the minority languages of
France (like Breton, a Celtic tongue spoken for more than 2,000
years), which were banned after the revolution in the name of
equality. By Marlise Simons.
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-OIL (Khartoum, Sudan) _ Oil was discovered in Sudan as
early as the 1920s, but the nation's Islamic government has only
now brought it to market. The big question is whether it will be a
force for peace or for yet more war. By Ian Fisher. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-WORKERS-PERILS (United Nations) _ On the continuing perils
U.N. workers face doing their work around the world. By Barbara
Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   N.C.-FLOYD-ENVIRON (Kenansville, N.C.) _ In the aftermath of
Hurricane Floyd, a decade of loose regulation that let eastern
North Carolina become the nation's biggest industrial producer of
turkeys and second biggest of hogs has come back to haunt the
state's public health and its environment. By Peter T. Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.-EARTHQUAKE (Los Angeles) _ An earthquake centered in the
Southern California desert with a preliminary magnitude of 7.0
shook buildings from downtown Los Angeles to Las Vegas early
Saturday and knocked an Amtrak train off its tracks. There were no
immediate reports of serious injuries or major damage. By Todd S.
Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   SUICIDE-HEARINGS _ In a stunning turn, there are now more
suicides by guns than homicides, and with the surging interest in
mental health and guns, the issue of suicide is taking on more
urgency. Later this month, for the first time ever in either the
Senate or the House, a Senate committee will hold hearings on
suicide. By Fox Butterfield.
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-RACE-GAP _ College Board report confirms gap between
blacks and whites. By Jodi Wilgoren.
</P>
<P>
   MASS-STADIUM (Springfield, Mass.) _ Springfield, the perennial
second city, is jumping into the stadium craze just as other cities
across the nation are struggling with the question of whether new
sports complexes will be economic boons or boondoggles.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.-GUNSALE-BAN (Los Angeles) _ A federal judge is to rule on
whether Los Angeles County can legally ban the sale of handguns on
its property.

<P>
   BRADLEY-CAMPAIGN _ A look at Bill Bradley after a rough week.
Will move late in the news cycle on Saturday. By James Dao.
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-LABOR (Los Angeles) _ The nation has lost 500,000
manufacturing jobs over the past 18 months, despite the economic
boom, and organized labor's eagerness to see that trend reversed is
shaping up as an economic test for President Clinton and a huge
political test for Vice President Al Gore. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   PHILLY-MAYOR-RACE (Philadelphia) _ No one ever said that this
city's vaunted brotherly love had to extend to the nip-and-tuck
mayoral contest that is winding down toward the distinct
possibility, according to opinion polls, of the first Republican
mayor in 52 years. But the sheer amiability on display lately in
the joint appearances of the two homestretch contenders _ a black
Democratic City Hall veteran and a white Republican businessman _
makes this a campaign to behold. By Francis X. Clines.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ At Tehran's Yousuf Abad synagogue, the packed
congregation gathered for the Sabbath was approaching the end of
Friday prayers. It was the moment one worshiper had been waiting
for, when the rise of hundreds of fervent voices made him inaudible
to all but a stranger beside him.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, urgently, the man spoke, of the chill that has spread
through the small Iranian Jewish community since the arrest in
March of 13 Jews who have been accused of spying for Israel.
Although the United States and dozens of other countries have
appealed for the case to be dropped, the Jews, and a group of
Muslims arrested with them, face the prospect of trial in a
revolutionary court in the southern city of Shiraz, at a date yet
to be set.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups outside Iran have suggested that the charges
have been trumped up for political reasons. In Iran, spokesmen for
Jewish organizations have mostly avoided discussing the case,
saying that protests from Jews, here or abroad, would only make
matters worse. But the man in the synagogue, dapper and bearded, a
merchant of about 50, had bottled-up feelings he wanted the
stranger to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my country, my Iran,'' he said, pressing close,
speaking clear English despite years of little use. ``When the
mullahs made their revolution 20 years ago, I could have left, like
many Jews, but I decided not to go. And why? Because my family came
here 2,500 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The man looked quickly at the rows of small boys and girls,
teen-agers in T-shirts and sneakers, men and women, doctors and
lawyers and engineers and businessmen and university professors, as
well as merchants from the bazaars and janitors and taxi drivers
and off-duty soldiers. Filling the balcony and every row of chairs
in the hall, they were a cross section of a community that traces
its origins to Jewish slaves freed by an ancient Persian ruler,
Cyrus the Great, after he conquered Babylon in the sixth century
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors of countless upheavals through the ages, the Jews who
remain here have endured an Islamic revolution that gave the
country a government that, at least until the rise of a powerful
reform movement in the past two years, the most militant and
anti-Western in the Muslim world. Although recognized as an
official minority in the Islamic Constitution, and allowed to
observe their religious practices and traditions, the Jews of Iran
have rarely known more difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine, 2,500 years!'' the bearded man in the synagogue
continued. ``My father, his father, and his father before him, for
centuries and centuries we have been here, always loyal to whoever
has ruled. And now, because of Shiraz, I know I must take my
family, and lock my house, and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, as worshipers gathered in tight groups before heading
into the Tehran night, the same anxiety found a dozen muffled
voices. In English or Persian, the same word, Shiraz, surfaced
again and again _ shorthand now, among Jews, for events in the city
550 miles south of Tehran where the 13 Jews were arrested, and
where they now face a trial that Jews here see as a direct threat
to the community's survival.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Among Jewish scholars outside Iran, the Shiraz case is being
compared to the last time any large group of Jews in a Muslim
country in the Middle East faced such serious charges. That was in
Baghdad, a few months after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, when a group
of Iraqi Jews were convicted on charges of spying for Israel, then
hanged from lampposts in a Baghdad square. That nightmare was the
last straw for Iraq's once-flourishing Jewish community. From
140,000 Jews in 1948, there are fewer than 100 now.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, fewer than 30,000 Jews, perhaps only 25,000, remain of
the 85,000 who were here at the time of the Islamic revolution in
1979. But even after the migration of the past 20 years, mostly to
Israel and the United States, Iran's Jewish population remains by
far the largest in any Muslim country in the Middle East, except
for Turkey, a country allied to the West. Elsewhere, from Morocco
to Iraq, Jewish residents are numbered in the dozens or low
hundreds, where there are any Jews left at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Jews arrested in Shiraz included a rabbi, two university
professors, several teachers in private Hebrew schools, a
government official, a kosher butcher and a 16-year-old youth.
Some, Iranian officials said, were brought to the jail in Shiraz
from Isfahan, a city midway between Tehran and Shiraz. At least
seven Muslims were arrested, too, a point Iranian officials have
emphasized to support the contention that the case has nothing to
do with religion. None of the accused have been allowed to see
families or lawyers, although some are said to have had contacts by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Even reformers like Kamal Kharrazi, the foreign minister, have
said that the origins of the case have ``nothing to do'' with the
defendants' religion, that it is ``closely related to Iran's
national security,'' and that Iran will not be pressured by outside
powers into abandoning its legal processes. Among Jews in Tehran,
there have been many rumors, mostly involving possible actions by
the Jews that overzealous investigators might have interpreted as
spying.
</P>
<P>
   One is that investigators found that the 16-year-old youth had
been sending e-mail messages to Israel. Another is that one of the
defendants worked on a secret aircraft project. Still another, that
several served as conscripts in Iran's armed forces, and could have
discussed their experiences in international telephone calls. Still
another, that several of the accused may have visited Israel
secretly, as many Iranian Jews do, despite laws forbidding it. But
so little has been divulged about the case by prosecutors that much
of this is surmise.

   The prosecutors' initial explanations, before the spying charges
were brought, were different _ that some of the accused had
violated exchange controls, and that others, in Hebrew schools,
defied rules requiring separation of male and female students in
classrooms. The shift in the charges was one reason why human
rights groups abroad concluded that the arrests were a tactic by
clerical hard-liners out to embarrass President Mohammad Khatami, a
reformer, and to foster anti-Western feelings among Iran's
population of 62 million ahead of February parliamentary elections
that will be a crucial test for his supporters.

</P>
<P>
   In a letter last month to the new head of the judiciary,
Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, a Khatami supporter, the New
York-based group Human Rights Watch put the matter bluntly. The
letter appealed to Shahroudi not to allow the Jews to become
``innocent casualties of political forces.''
</P>
<P>
   It added: ``We are particularly concerned that these members of
the Jewish minority may have been singled out for persecution to
make a political point, as a gambit in what is widely described as
a struggle within Iran's leadership.'' After receiving the letter,
Shahroudi confirmed that the Shiraz trial would go ahead.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The plight of the 13 has been made grimmer by the fact that
their case is to be heard by a revolutionary court. Commonly used
in security cases, revolutionary courts are headed by Muslim
clerics judging according to Islamic laws _ often men who have
little or no grounding in ordinary criminal law. Trials are usually
brief, often with scant opportunity for defense, and death
sentences have been common.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In June, Iran's chief justice, Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi,
pronounced the Jews held in Shiraz guilty, and implied that
execution was a foregone conclusion. But Yazdi has since been
dismissed, and high-level officials have said in recent weeks that
the men will not be hanged. Kharrazi, the foreign minister, told
reporters in New York on Oct. 2 that Iran does not execute spies in
peacetime, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said that
the United States has been given similar assurances.
</P>
<P>
   The man to whom many Iranians now look for relief from the
arbitrariness of Islamic rule, Khatami _ a moderate Muslim cleric
elected 29 months ago on a pledge to make Iran a democratic
country, with respect for human rights and law _ has also attempted
to allay fears.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting two weeks ago with women's groups, he was asked
about the Shiraz case by Farangis Hassidim, the nursing matron of
the 102-bed Jewish hospital in Tehran, which uses Jewish charitable
donations to help treat a patient load that is more than 90 percent
Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami reproved Mrs. Hassidim for not asking about the Muslims
in the case. But he went on: ``It's the court that will decide if
the facts are proven. If the facts are not proven, the accused will
be acquitted. The court must decide their fate and give its ruling
in all fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier, addressing ethnic minorities in the shrine
built to the cleric who led the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, Khatami said Jews were equal citizens in Iran.
``Anti-Semitism and fascism are a Western phenomenon, not an
eastern one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Senior Iranian officials say privately that the 53-year-old
Khatami is in a difficult position, as he is caught in a wider
political struggle with the conservatives clerics and his powers
are limited by constitutional provisions that leave most authority,
including control of the courts, to Iran's spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials close to the president say that he can help the
Shiraz Jews, and possibly even assure their acquittal. ``The
situation is very different from what would have been even two
years ago,'' a high-ranking official said. ``The revolutionary
courts can still come up with cases that are politically motivated,
but now they know that they at least have to have a case. They
can't just make any allegation and convict. Now, there are people
loyal to President Khatami who will hold them to account.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is full of paradox for Jews here, who, like many
other Iranians, had just begun to breathe more easily in the wake
of Khatami's election. Although being a Jew in a militant Islamic
state has posed special problems, many Jews say their situation was
not much worse during the most zealous years of Islamic rule than
the situations of most other Iranians.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If 17 Jews were hanged, they note, so too were hundreds, even
thousands, of Muslim Iranians. Much is made of the fact that
Ayatollah Khomeini, although fierce in his condemnations of Israel,
met shortly after the Islamic revolution in 1979 with Jewish
leaders, and promised the community protection.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Islamic revolution, Jews have been a recognized
minority, with guaranteed civil rights, freedom to keep Jewish
traditions and to run Jewish schools. In Tehran, there are 27
synagogues, several of them modernized with help of donations from
American Jewish groups. Like Christians, Zoroastrians and other
minority groups, they have a reserved seat in Parliament, currently
held by Manucher Eliassi, a 58-year-old Tehran doctor who has been
in the forefront of efforts to help the Shiraz Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Eliassi appealed to American Jewish groups not
to be vociferous. ``I think the case of the Shiraz 13 is just a
misunderstanding, and it will be solved soon,'' he said. ``The
American Jewish community should not worry. It is a domestic
problem, and we can handle it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Jews speaking formally for the community have been
careful to accentuate the positive, praising the ruling clerics for
their tolerance and encouraging Jews everywhere in Iran to do
likewise, to the point of posting Ayatollah Khomeini's picture in
their offices and clinics and shops. Eliassi is no exception.
``From the beginning of the revolution, we have never had any
problems with the revolutionary government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can listen to our own music, we can wear our traditional
clothing, we can even have wine at our weddings and religious
ceremonies. There is no problem. We are 100 percent free.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Jews have deep, deep roots in this country, and I am
very sure that there will never be an Iran without Jews.''

WHITE DOCTORS, BLACK PATIENTS: NOT A SIMPLE CASE OF HEALTH RACISM

<P>
   Not even sickness and death are beyond the reach of racial
inequality. Blacks are more likely than whites to suffer from
dangerous conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney
failure. Black women are more likely than whites to die in
childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most troubling news came last week: A study found
that blacks were less likely than whites to get surgery for early
stages of lung cancer and, as a result, more likely to die from a
potentially curable disease.
</P>
<P>
   What looked like a straightforward case of racism, though, may
well be something more complicated: a breakdown in doctor-patient
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The study is forcing doctors to confront what they may be doing
wrong: For some reason, their black patients are not getting the
message that surgery could save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   A legacy of suspicion may further cloud already emotionally
fraught doctor-patient consultations. For example, black doctors
say many black patients remain wary of the health care system
because of the notorious Tuskegee study, in which black men with
syphilis were left untreated for 40 years so that government
doctors could study the course of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The new lung cancer study, based on the records of nearly 11,000
patients 65 and over, appeared in the New England Journal of
Medicine. The authors, led by Dr. Peter Bach of Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, concluded that the
inequity in treatment seemed to stem from race itself. They found
no significant differences between the blacks and whites the study
tracked, in socioeconomic status, insurance, complicating illnesses
or access to care.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted with the racial disparities in care for blacks
and whites, many doctors have tended to blame the patient. Blacks
are prone to obesity, smoke more, and seek medical treatment later
_ often because they also tend to be poorer than whites, with lower
rates of health insurance and less ability to pay doctors' fees.
</P>
<P>
   But the study ruled out the usual excuses. That raised two
unpalatable possibilities. Either doctors were not recommending
surgery to blacks as often as to whites, or blacks, for some
mystifying reason, were more likely to say no to lifesaving
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold Freeman, a cancer surgeon and president of North
General Hospital in New York's Harlem, dismissed the thought of
blatant racism. ``I'm not cynical enough to think people would
purposely deny someone treatment,'' said Freeman, who is black. ``I
have more faith in humanity than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whites dominate the medical profession; only 4 percent of
doctors are black. In some cases white doctors and black patients
may have trouble talking to each other not just because of color,
or the undercurrent of tension between the races, but also because
of differences in social class, education, background and
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Talmadge King, chief of medical services at San Francisco
General Hospital, said: ``We have tended to blame the patient, but
I think the problem is on the side of the doctors. It's up to us to
understand where the patient is and learn how to communicate so
they can understand what we're saying.''
</P>
<P>
   King said that if a doctor did not understand a patient's
background and presented information about cancer in a way that the
patient had trouble accepting, the patient might reject the advice
or might take so long to finally accept it that in the meantime the
cancer might advance and become inoperable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a ticking time bomb,'' he said. ``Medical schools are
now getting very interested in training doctors to be culturally
sensitive and to understand diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   If a treatment is presented to a black patient as experimental,
King said, ``that can be really detrimental in your communication''
because it raises the specter of Tuskegee in some minds. In the
study, 400 black men were left untreated from 1932 until 1972, even
though penicillin came into use to cure syphilis during the 1940s.
And experimental treatment does come up in discussions about lung
cancer, because if the disease progresses after surgery, patients
may need chemotherapy and are often advised that they may benefit
from studies of new drugs. If that is not carefully explained by
someone the patient trusts, the patient may become alienated.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bach's study did not detect socioeonomic differences
between the black and white patients, Freeman said the records,
from the Medicare program for people 65 and older, may not have
been detailed enough to pick up such differences. Studies have
shown that blacks have less wealth _ fewer assets and savings, for
instance _ than whites even when their incomes are the same.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, he said, ``are more often people with other priorities,
survival priorities like food, clothing and shelter, and avoiding
of crime, and then you tell them they also have cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors may have no idea what such patients' lives are like or
what sort of help they would need to rearrange their lives to deal
with a major illness.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Freeman said, ``I've practiced surgery in the black
community for 32 years, and it is a rare, rare patient who will not
follow my advice. So I am discomforted by somebody saying `We
couldn't communicate, we tried to tell this person and couldn't get
it over.' I say that's a poor excuse. If you take the time and say
it in the right way, the poorest people will understand. Poor black
people in Harlem are very reliable when you communicate to them in
an appropriate way. You can't throw up your hands and say, `I can't
communicate with these people.'''
</P>
<P>
   Telling someone he or she has cancer and must have all or part
of a lung cut out is a wrenching and arduous task. When the doctor
and patient come from different worlds and the patient seems
reluctant to listen, it may be easier for doctors to tell
themselves they have done their jobs and let the patient walk away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to, how much, really, fundamentally, deep down
in yourself do you value the other person?'' Freeman said. ``If you
were dealing with somebody who looked exactly like you look, would
you take it another step?''

<P>
   It took Grantland Rice three tries to get it right. In 1922,
writing about the Notre Dame-Army football game, he led with
``Notre Dame's attack is more like a modern war offensive than
anything we have seen.'' Nope. In 1923, again covering the Irish
and the Cadets, he began, ``Brazil can cheer about its coffee ...''
Definitely not.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 18, 1924 _ almost exactly 75 years ago _ he finally
found the right rhythm and imagery and struck hard and clean as a
Knute Rockne-coached linebacker:
</P>
<P>
   ``Outlined against a blue, gray October sky, the Four Horsemen
rode again. In dramatic lore, they were known as Famine,
Pestilence, Destruction, and Death. These are only aliases. Their
real names are Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley, and Layden. They
formed the crest of the South Bend cyclone before which another
fighting Army team was swept over the precipice of the Polo Grounds
this afternoon. ...''
</P>
<P>
   In a few swift, polished sentences _ and with an assist from a
photograph _ Rice changed his own life, his profession, the course
of college football and the character of American leisure culture.
</P>
<P>
   The 1920s were the golden age of myth-making sports journalism.
A handful of talented writers who found other paths to literary
fame blocked began to notice, as indeed their editors had already
noticed, that a rising middle class was responding more to the
exploits of Jack Dempsey, Babe Ruth and Bobby Jones than to what
would come to be known as ``hard'' news stories.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gallico of the New York Daily News, who later went on to
better things, admitted to being a ``Gee-Whizzer'' _ one of the new
breed of sportswriter who wrote in ``the most florid and exciting
prose.''
</P>
<P>
   Grantland Rice, writing for the New York Herald Tribune, was the
king of the Gee-Whizzers. As Murray Sperber wrote in ``Shake Down
the Thunder,'' his history of Notre Dame football, ``Each day he
flung out metaphors about athletes and sports events and, indeed,
some of his words stick to the American psyche. ... The vast
majority of his figures of speech quickly disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   The lines that stick with us today were a happy combination of
skill and circumstance. To begin with, Rice had picked the right
sport, and the right team. The rise of football _ and college
football in the 1920s and for several decades thereafter  &UR; was &LR; 
football _ coincided with the rise of the sports pages and the
Gee-Whizzers. Some historians have called the explosion of football
popularity a newspaper phenomenon. College football had been a
small-time sport with local appeal at best before near-hysterical
coverage made it a national game in the rank of, if not actually on
a par with, big-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Sperber relates an incident between the Notre Dame football
coach, Knute Rockne, and a journalist that makes the point: ``Tut,
tut, Rockne,'' the writer responded when the Notre Dame coach
complained about the paper's football coverage. ``You know damn
well that were it not for newspapers, not five hundred people would
be interested in Notre Dame, Nebraska, or the whole kit and
kaboodle of football teams.''
</P>
<P>
   If that was true before 1924, it wasn't true afterward.
</P>
<P>
   College football and sports pages combined to make each other,
and both helped to create Grantland Rice. He got a big boost, too,
from the night editor of the Herald Tribune, who loved the lead for
Rice's 1924 Notre Dame-Army story and put it on the front page of
the Sunday morning paper. Other papers picked up the story.
</P>
<P>
   Today, hardly anyone remembers the actual game. It wasn't even
the biggest story in college football that day: Red Grange had
scored five touchdowns against Michigan, and most papers, including
Rice's own, considered that game the bigger event. Notre Dame's
13-7 victory wasn't even its most impressive win that season.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice, a friend of Knute Rockne, correctly perceived that
Notre Dame would be the football team with national appeal, and for
thousands of fans that Sunday, and for millions more who would read
the story in weeks and months and, as it appeared in anthologies of
sportswriting, years to come, that fall Saturday would forever be
the day the Four Horsemen rode.
</P>
<P>
   George Strickler, a Notre Dame press assistant, gave Rice his
inspiration when he likened the Irish backfield to the stars of the
Rudolph Valentino film ``The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.''
Rice took the ball, as it were, from there. Strickler then picked
it up and ran it for another score when he messaged back to South
Bend, Ind., for a photographer to shoot the Notre Dame backfield on
horses. It was a cute picture, but for many it only seemed to
diminish the myth _ in truth, the four heroes looked a little
uneasy on horses. The picture was not worth the thousand words Rice
wrote. Actually, it didn't measure up to the 12 words of his lead
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outlined against blue, gray October sky ...'' What was Rice's
vantage point? Looking up from the turf of the football field? It
must have seemed so to newspaper readers all over the country to
whom the Four Horsemen must have seemed larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   Within three decades, TV would make athletes smaller than life.
Rarely again would sportswriters see athletes in such mythic (and

than Dempsey, Ruth, Jones and the Four Horsemen, but fans would
watch them over and over on TV and have no need of poetic writing
to make their feats seem memorable.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It took Grantland Rice three tries to get it right. In 1922,
writing about the Notre Dame-Army football game, he led with
``Notre Dame's attack is more like a modern war offensive than
anything we have seen.'' Nope. In 1923, again covering the Irish
and the Cadets, he began, ``Brazil can cheer about its coffee ...''
Definitely not.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 18, 1924 _ almost exactly 75 years ago _ he finally
found the right rhythm and imagery and struck hard and clean as a
Knute Rockne-coached linebacker:
</P>
<P>
   ``Outlined against a blue, gray October sky, the Four Horsemen
rode again. In dramatic lore, they were known as Famine,
Pestilence, Destruction, and Death. These are only aliases. Their
real names are Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley, and Layden. They
formed the crest of the South Bend cyclone before which another
fighting Army team was swept over the precipice of the Polo Grounds
this afternoon. ...''
</P>
<P>
   In a few swift, polished sentences _ and with an assist from a
photograph _ Rice changed his own life, his profession, the course
of college football and the character of American leisure culture.
</P>
<P>
   The 1920s were the golden age of myth-making sports journalism.
A handful of talented writers who found other paths to literary
fame blocked began to notice, as indeed their editors had already
noticed, that a rising middle class was responding more to the
exploits of Jack Dempsey, Babe Ruth and Bobby Jones than to what
would come to be known as ``hard'' news stories.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gallico of the New York Daily News, who later went on to
better things, admitted to being a ``Gee-Whizzer'' _ one of the new
breed of sportswriter who wrote in ``the most florid and exciting
prose.''
</P>
<P>
   Grantland Rice, writing for the New York Herald Tribune, was the
king of the Gee-Whizzers. As Murray Sperber wrote in ``Shake Down
the Thunder,'' his history of Notre Dame football, ``Each day he
flung out metaphors about athletes and sports events and, indeed,
some of his words stick to the American psyche. ... The vast
majority of his figures of speech quickly disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   The lines that stick with us today were a happy combination of
skill and circumstance. To begin with, Rice had picked the right
sport, and the right team. The rise of football _ and college
football in the 1920s and for several decades thereafter  &UR; was &LR; 
football _ coincided with the rise of the sports pages and the
Gee-Whizzers. Some historians have called the explosion of football
popularity a newspaper phenomenon. College football had been a
small-time sport with local appeal at best before near-hysterical
coverage made it a national game in the rank of, if not actually on
a par with, big-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Sperber relates an incident between the Notre Dame football
coach, Knute Rockne, and a journalist that makes the point: ``Tut,
tut, Rockne,'' the writer responded when the Notre Dame coach
complained about the paper's football coverage. ``You know damn
well that were it not for newspapers, not five hundred people would
be interested in Notre Dame, Nebraska, or the whole kit and
kaboodle of football teams.''
</P>
<P>
   If that was true before 1924, it wasn't true afterward.
</P>
<P>
   College football and sports pages combined to make each other,
and both helped to create Grantland Rice. He got a big boost, too,
from the night editor of the Herald Tribune, who loved the lead for
Rice's 1924 Notre Dame-Army story and put it on the front page of
the Sunday morning paper. Other papers picked up the story.
</P>
<P>
   Today, hardly anyone remembers the actual game. It wasn't even
the biggest story in college football that day: Red Grange had
scored five touchdowns against Michigan, and most papers, including
Rice's own, considered that game the bigger event. Notre Dame's
13-7 victory wasn't even its most impressive win that season.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice, a friend of Knute Rockne, correctly perceived that
Notre Dame would be the football team with national appeal, and for
thousands of fans that Sunday, and for millions more who would read
the story in weeks and months and, as it appeared in anthologies of
sportswriting, years to come, that fall Saturday would forever be
the day the Four Horsemen rode.
</P>
<P>
   George Strickler, a Notre Dame press assistant, gave Rice his
inspiration when he likened the Irish backfield to the stars of the
Rudolph Valentino film ``The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.''
Rice took the ball, as it were, from there. Strickler then picked
it up and ran it for another score when he messaged back to South
Bend, Ind., for a photographer to shoot the Notre Dame backfield on
horses. It was a cute picture, but for many it only seemed to
diminish the myth _ in truth, the four heroes looked a little
uneasy on horses. The picture was not worth the thousand words Rice
wrote. Actually, it didn't measure up to the 12 words of his lead
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outlined against blue, gray October sky ...'' What was Rice's
vantage point? Looking up from the turf of the football field? It
must have seemed so to newspaper readers all over the country to
whom the Four Horsemen must have seemed larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   Within three decades, TV would make athletes smaller than life.
Rarely again would sportswriters see athletes in such mythic (and
unrealistic) proportions. The athletes would be as great or greater
than Dempsey, Ruth, Jones and the Four Horsemen, but fans would
watch them over and over on TV and have no need of poetic writing
to make their feats seem memorable.

   Alfred Nobel stipulated that the recipients of his namesake
prizes ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.''
But often the annual prize announcements provoke second-guessing.
Detractors have long pointed out, for example, that Freud never won
the Nobel for medicine, and that Chekhov, Proust and Conrad are
among the giants who never won for literature.
</P>
<P>
   Even when an award goes to the right person, it may be for the
wrong _ or at least arguable _ reasons. Such is the case with
Albert Einstein, whose 1921 physics Nobel was bestowed not for the

</P>
<P>
   With the Nobel season just wrapping up, it's worth noting the
critical reaction to some of the disputed honorees of the past. The
envelopes, please.
</P>
<P>
   _ By THOMAS VINCIGUERRA
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The most disputed science Nobel was probably
the 1918 chemistry award to Fritz Haber, who helped develop poison
gas for Germany during World War I. Morris Goran noted in ``The
Story of Fritz Haber'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1967) how the
scientist's record haunted him right after the war and later when
he won the prize:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Believing himself a potential war criminal, Haber grew a beard
as a disguise and went to Switzerland for several weeks; he was
afraid of being delivered to the Allies. ... Others remembered that
in Karlsruhe (Institute of Technology) Haber had been depicted as
Hamlet in a graveyard, leaning on a gas cylinder and holding a
skull. The caricature, drawn in 1904 at a Christmas party, was
intended to show his interest in gas chemistry and his diversion to
dramatics. Soon after the war it was subject to different
interpretation. Even many years later, an Allied scientist chose to
point out Haber in a photograph by drawing a gas mask over his
face. ...
</P>
<P>
   In November 1919, he was awarded the 1918 chemistry prize.
Frenchmen offered awards declined the honor rather than be in the
same company with their former enemy. One French scholar accused
the Swedes ... of manufacturing gas masks for the German army.
Another called Haber ``morally unfit for the honor and material
benefits of a Nobel prize.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Today, the lobotomy is largely discredited
and rarely performed. Yet Egas Moniz of Portugal shared the 1949
Nobel in medicine for pioneering this radical brain operation,
which was supposed to cure certain mental illnesses. In ``Great and
Desperate Cures'' (Basic Books, 1986), Elliot Valenstein described
how Moniz's very first monograph about the procedure, published in
1936, revealed it as dangerously suspect:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The psychological symptoms produced by the surgery were apathy,
akinesia (retarded movement or inertia), loss of initiative
(present in one half of Moniz's patients; and in a few, prolonged),
catatonic ``attitude,'' mutism (... observed in 11 of the 20
cases), negativism, disturbed orientation in space and time,
puerility (one patient carried around and rocked dolls she had
made), kleptomania and abnormal hunger sensations (experienced by
one-quarter of the patients). In all, a serious list of
psychological problems, except that Moniz insisted that these
symptoms lasted no more than several weeks. With absolutely no
evidence, he asserted unequivocally that the operation did not
impair intelligence or memory.
</P>
<P>
   While Moniz stated in his monograph that the apathy was
transient, Sobral Cid, in his critical comments made in Paris in
1937, insisted that the apathy might last much longer and could be
permanent. Moniz ... later seemed to confirm this criticism when in
the same year he reported modifying his initial surgical procedure,
as ``two or three of the patients in my first series have remained
somewhat apathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)In 1982, Rigoberta Menchu of Guatemala wrote
``I, Rigoberta Menchu,'' a memoir of her country's agonizing civil
war; she won the Peace Prize 10 years later. But in ``Rigoberta
Menchu and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans'' (Westview, 1999),
David Stoll found that she had fabricated much of her story. At the
time the prize was announced, the truth was troublesome enough:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Her selection revived the debate over the parameters of
acceptability, because her 1982 testament clearly advocates
violence. Invoking the Bible for precedents, Rigoberta makes
Molotov cocktails, endorses bomb threats as a tactic, and debates
whether to execute an old woman suspected of being an informer
(fortunately for the future Peace laureate, the suspect is judged
innocent). A related objection was that Rigoberta still belonged to
the guerrilla movement. The Nobel committee sidestepped this issue
by deciding that it was unknowable. Instead the committee
attributed political violence in Guatemala to ethnic tension. The
committee also avoided any explicit reference to the book that made
Rigoberta famous, as if to evade any doubts on that score.

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)These days, academics have few kind words
for the 1938 literature laureate Pearl Buck, whose ability to
produce best-sellers is seen as proof of her middlebrow status.
Peter Conn reported in ``Pearl S. Buck: A Cultural Biography''
(Cambridge University, 1996) that this low regard, tinged with
misogyny, was already entrenched when she won the prize:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A day after the announcement, for example, critic Norman Holmes
Pearson grumbled that ``this woman, Pearl Buck, was given the Nobel
Prize for literature. Do they intend to make it as hammish (sic) as
the Pulitzer award? Thank heavens I have seen no one who has taken
it seriously and none of the great congratulatory articles which
followed a similar award to O'Neill last winter. Mrs. Buck's only
comment seemed to be, `I was terribly surprised' _ nuts to her, say
I, I think that was putting it mildly.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson's derisory views echoed those of most of the country's
leading cultural opinion makers. Pearl's Asian subjects, her prose
style, her gender, and her tremendous popularity offended virtually
every one of the constituencies that divided up the literary 1930s.
Marxists, Agrarians, Chicago formalists, New York intellectuals,
literary nationalists and New Humanists had little enough in
common, but they could all agree that Pearl Buck had no place in
any of their creeds and canons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Pearl's selection for the Nobel Prize became a
shorthand proof of the Swedish Academy's bad judgment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The most ``ig-Nobel'' literature winner was
surely 1920s Knut Hamsun of Norway, who became a Nazi collaborator.
Robert Ferguson's ``Enigma: The Life of Knut Hamsun'' (Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux, 1987) offers this example of Hamsun's devotion to
the Third Reich:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Back in Norway after the trip he looked for a way to express his
appreciation of (Joseph) Goebbels' courtesy in receiving him. He
puzzled for some time over the most appropriate gift, and finally
hit on the idea of presenting the doctor with the medal which he
received for the Nobel Prize in 1920. On 17 June he sent it, along
with a short explanatory note:
</P>
<P>
   ``To Minister of the Reich Dr. Goebbels. I wish to thank you for
all the kindness you showed to me on my recent trip to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot thank you enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobel founded his Award as a reward for the most `idealistic'
writing during the recent past. I know of no one, Minister, who has
so idealistically and tirelessly written and preached the case for
Europe, and for mankind, year in and year out, as yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive me for sending you my medal. It is a quite useless
thing for you, but I have nothing else to send.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)So if you've been unfairly passed over for a
Nobel, take heart. Leo Tolstoy lost the first Literature prize in
1901 to the forgettable Rene F. A. Sully Prudhomme. Tolstoy wrote
philosophically:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I was very pleased to learn that the Nobel Prize was not given
to me. First, because it spared me the great problem of disposing
of the money, which, like all money, can lead only to evil, in my
view; and second, because it has given me the honor and great
pleasure of receiving such expressions of sympathy from so many
highly esteemed although unknown persons.

   SEATTLE _ It sounds like a philosophical cousin to the age-old
question of whether a tree falling in the forest makes a sound if
no one is around to hear it. In this case, though, federal
officials are seeking to add an economic variable to the puzzle:
just how much is it worth to  &UR; you &LR;  to know that a once-dammed river
is running wild again _ even if you never visit it?
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a major study of whether or not to breach four
huge hydroelectric dams on the Snake River in eastern Washington,
economists with the Army Corps of Engineers are adding a factor
known as ``existence value'' to their list of costs and benefits of
the contentious proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Breaching the dams would restore 140 miles of the lower Snake to
its wild, free-flowing condition and would, many biologists argue,
stand a good chance of revitalizing endangered salmon runs in the
river. Aside from calculating the proposal's effects on jobs,
electric bills and shipping rates, the government is now hoping to
assign a dollar value to Americans' knowledge that a piece of their
wilderness might be regained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an indication that there are certainly folks out there
who are willing to pay for the existence of something in the
wild,'' said Dennis Wagner, the Corps official overseeing an
economic analysis for the agency. ``I think we'd be remiss in not
presenting something to the decision makers. How they use that
information is up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of existence value, favored by many environmentalists
as a legitimate policy tool in conservation debates and ridiculed
by critics as unquantifiable, meaningless or both, has been around
since the 1960s. ``There's not a single, agreed-upon definition,''
said Tom Stevens, a professor of resource economics at the
University of Massachusetts. ``But the basic idea is that yes,
people do place a value on things they know they are never going to
use, or maybe even to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept, also known as contingent value or passive-use
value, has been increasingly cited in legal battles over issues
like logging in the Alaskan wilderness or offshore oil drilling.
Yet many economists say that while existence value is, in theory, a
perfectly valid factor to bring to the table, coming up with
precise ways to gauge how much people value something like
wilderness is far more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that you'd be willing to pay something for some state
of the world to exist, as you would pay for a commodity or a
contract for services, is not at all crazy,'' said Alan Randall,
chairman of the department of agricultural, environmental and
development economics at Ohio State University. ``The controversy,
really, is mostly about measurability.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Snake River debate, for instance, proponents of the
dam-breaching proposal have pointed to polls suggesting that
Seattle-area residents would be willing to pay a few extra dollars
a month on their electricity bills in order to save salmon runs. In
addition, Stevens and a team of economists at the University of
Massachusetts found in a survey several years ago that residents of
the Connecticut River Valley area said they would pay, on average,
$7.90 annually in higher electric bills for efforts to preserve
Atlantic salmon spawning in that river.
</P>
<P>
   And at the height of a legal fight with Exxon over the 1989 oil
spill from the Exxon Valdez tanker, the state of Alaska
commissioned a $3 million study of what Americans who said they
were unlikely to ever visit Prince William Sound would be willing
to pay to avoid a similar accident. About $30, was the average
respondent's figure.
</P>
<P>
   Using polls and other data, some economists at the Corps of
Engineers have calculated that breaching the four Snake River dams
and successfully restoring the salmon is an idea for which
Americans would be willing to shell out as much as $1 billion, but
others have pegged the figure much lower, said Wagner. ``It's
really not an exact thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, proponents of breaching the dams say that even if the
existence value of restoring the river and salmon can't be
precisely quantified, it is both large and meaningful. ``If that
guy in Dubuque thinks that this is important, that shows that this
is a national issue,'' said Chris Zimmer, a spokesman for Save Our
Wild Salmon, a Seattle-based environmental group. ``This is a
quality-of-life issue for people. It's important to their
well-being that they know we still have wild places left.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue, in effect, that it doesn't really matter what the
guy in Dubuque thinks. ``It's really an affront to the people who
live here,'' said Bruce Lovelin, executive director of the Columbia
River Alliance, which represents industrial users of the Columbia
and the Snake. ``I mean, unless you're going to come up here and
spend some money to recreate, don't tell us how we should run
things in the Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Others question whether such a value can be accurately measured.
``The only way to do it is to ask people what they would be willing
to pay, and in my view you ask people questions like that and you
get very upwardly biased results,'' said Jerry Hausman, an
economics professor at MIT. ``When somebody calls you on the phone
to ask, it's not real money.''
</P>
<P>
   Existence values are generally used to buttress the
environmentalists' side of the debate, but that doesn't mean all
environmentalists like the idea. ``Maybe it's really not
appropriate to try to put dollar values on something like
wilderness,'' Stevens said. ``After all, what if you add up all
those numbers and they don't come out in your favor?''
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, whose department oversees
national parks and much of the more than 100 million acres
designated as protected wilderness, also cautions against using
existence values in environmental debates _ but largely because
they may wind up understating the value of wilderness.

   There is no Nobel prize in metaphysics. But if there were, it
would surely go to the thinker who could solve the stubborn mystery
of why mathematics so often mirrors the workings of the physical
world. Rocks arc through the sky in parabolic trajectories, planets
swing in ellipses around the sun. And inside atoms, tiny particles
move according to the mathematics of quantum mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   But not every equation is so well behaved. Sometimes they
predict absurdities like subatomic particles with negative masses
or even negative probabilities of existing. What could it mean for
something to weigh less than nothing or to have less than a zero
chance of being real? ``Physics in the never-never land,'' the
theorist Marvin Goldberger once called these mathematical chimera.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two Dutch physicists, Gerardus 't Hooft and his
former teacher, Martinus (Tini) Veltman, belatedly won a Nobel
Prize for showing, in the early 1970s, that a theory connecting two
of the four forces of nature belonged not in the land of Peter Pan
but among the handful of mathematical inventions that speak truths
about the world.
</P>
<P>
   Having parsed reality into four forces _ gravity,
electromagnetism and the weak and strong nuclear forces _
physicists have been trying ever since to fit the pieces back
together. They dream of ``unifying'' these separate phenomena,
showing they are different manifestations of a single superforce
that existed in the first moments after the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1960s, physicists had taken an important step toward
unification with a theory blending electromagnetism with the weak
force. But it was not clear whether this ``electroweak'' theory was
sound. Like a buggy piece of software, it might churn out
quantities that were infinite, as when you divide a number by zero.
If so, the theory would be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Decades earlier, spurious infinities had threatened to wreck the
crown jewel of early 20th-century physics: quantum electrodynamics.
The theory, which explains electromagnetism, is an example of a
more general notion called quantum field theory, in which forces
are carried by ephemeral particles, called quanta, that pop in and
out of existence too quickly to be observed. For electromagnetism
these messengers (or ``virtual particles'') are called photons.
They shuttle back and forth between two electrons, causing them to
repel each another.
</P>
<P>
   But a single electron would also interact with itself, like a
snake swallowing its own tail. The result, the equations predicted,
was an endlessly looping process that would bestow the particle
with infinite mass and charge. This was so obviously false that
many physicists came to doubt the whole idea of quantum field
theory. There were other crazy infinities as well. Maybe it was
time to uproot the entire foundation of particle physics and begin
anew.
</P>
<P>
   It came as a relief when, in the late 1940s, Richard Feynman,
Julian Schwinger and Sin-itiro Tomonaga independently discovered a
way to ``renormalize'' the equations _ manipulating them so the
infinities cancel one another out like terms in an algebraic
equation. The result was measurements so precise that, as Feynman
later put it, it was like gauging the distance from Los Angeles to
New York within the width of a human hair.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone was impressed with this shell game.
``Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it turns
out to be small,'' the great theorist Paul Dirac complained, ``not
neglecting it because it is infinitely great and you do not want
it!'' Even after he shared a Nobel Prize for the work, Feynman
dismissed it as ``hocus pocus,'' insisting that he had been honored
for sweeping a problem under the rug.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, by the time electromagnetism and the weak force were on
the verge of being unified, quantum field theory had fallen again
into disrepute. At the University of Utrecht, Veltman, who had been
laboring over the infinities for years, found an ally in Gerard 't
hooft.
</P>
<P>
   The two could hardly have been more different, said Peter van
Nieuwenhuizen, who was with them at the time. With a thick black
beard and shining eyes, Veltman was large, imposing, bluntly
honest. ``He looked like a character from a Dutch painting,'' said
van Nieuwenhuizen, who is now director of the C.N. Yang Institute
for Theoretical Physics at the State University of New York at
Stony Brook. 'T hooft was small, soft-spoken, diplomatic. From the
day he arrived, it was clear he was a star.
</P>
<P>
   The obsessive Veltman once said he would gladly give up a finger
to make the infinities go away. With an unusual ability to see an
old problem in a new light, 't hooft broke the ice jam. ``He could
solve problems that seemed unsolvable in a way so elegant that you
could only sit in absolute stupefaction,'' van Nieuwenhuizen said.
</P>
<P>
   Using Veltman's earlier work as a platform, the younger
scientist found the key to renormalizing electroweak theory,
reconciling the infinities. He also deepened the understanding of
how, in the early moments of creation, the two forces might have
come unraveled. The agent for this ``spontaneous symmetry
breaking'' was a particle, still undiscovered, called the Higgs.
</P>
<P>
   The symmetry between teacher and student was also destined to
break. Veltman thought the Higgs particle was baloney. And over the
years, he came to feel that his student's contributions were being
celebrated more than his own. Gradually they drifted apart. But the
ideas that emerged from their uneasy collaboration changed physics.
</P>
<P>
   The two scientists accomplished far more than simply debugging
electroweak theory. Their work applied to electromagnetism and the
strong force as well, bringing quantum field theory to a new height
of respectability. Today's Standard Model, which describes the
workings of all the forces but gravity, is cast in this very form.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists still argue about whether renormalization is a mere
trick or a clue, still barely understood, to some deep truth of
nature. Most leave such questions to the metaphysicians, content to
get on with their work.

into disrepute. At the University of Utrecht, Veltman, who had been
laboring over the infinities for years, found an ally in Gerard 't
hooft.
</P>
<P>
   The two could hardly have been more different, said Peter van
Nieuwenhuizen, who was with them at the time. With a thick black
beard and shining eyes, Veltman was large, imposing, bluntly
honest. ``He looked like a character from a Dutch painting,'' said
van Nieuwenhuizen, who is now director of the C.N. Yang Institute
for Theoretical Physics at the State University of New York at
Stony Brook. 'T hooft was small, soft-spoken, diplomatic. From the
day he arrived, it was clear he was a star.
</P>
<P>
   The obsessive Veltman once said he would gladly give up a finger
to make the infinities go away. With an unusual ability to see an
old problem in a new light, 't hooft broke the ice jam. ``He could
solve problems that seemed unsolvable in a way so elegant that you
could only sit in absolute stupefaction,'' van Nieuwenhuizen said.
</P>
<P>
   Using Veltman's earlier work as a platform, the younger
scientist found the key to renormalizing electroweak theory,
reconciling the infinities. He also deepened the understanding of
how, in the early moments of creation, the two forces might have
come unraveled. The agent for this ``spontaneous symmetry
breaking'' was a particle, still undiscovered, called the Higgs.
</P>
<P>
   The symmetry between teacher and student was also destined to
break. Veltman thought the Higgs particle was baloney. And over the
years, he came to feel that his student's contributions were being
celebrated more than his own. Gradually they drifted apart. But the
ideas that emerged from their uneasy collaboration changed physics.
</P>
<P>
   The two scientists accomplished far more than simply debugging
electroweak theory. Their work applied to electromagnetism and the
strong force as well, bringing quantum field theory to a new height
of respectability. Today's Standard Model, which describes the
workings of all the forces but gravity, is cast in this very form.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists still argue about whether renormalization is a mere
trick or a clue, still barely understood, to some deep truth of
nature. Most leave such questions to the metaphysicians, content to
get on with their work.

ANALYSIS: NUCLEAR TREATY FAILURE COULD HURT CLINTON'S AUTHORITY
ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The humbling of the White House over the nuclear
test ban treaty augurs poorly for President Clinton's securing any
crowning foreign policy achievement in the last year of his term.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was so severe that some administration and
congressional officials wondered if it would prematurely dent
Clinton's authority on foreign affairs at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Without a Soviet threat looming abroad, difficult and expensive
issues of national security are coming under closer scrutiny from
members of Congress whose constituents prefer to see dollars spent
on domestic concerns, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it doubly incumbent on the administration to combine
foresight with detailed strategy and hard work to achieve its
foreign policy goals. The White House displayed none of this acumen
in the run-up to the vote on the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the administration ostensibly made any sustained
preparations for realizing other foreign policy goals still
cherished by the president: a comprehensive Middle East peace
settlement that will require tens of billions of dollars in U.S.
and European assistance or welcoming China into the world's major
trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, planning of laser precision helped win the slim
portfolio of foreign policy victories that may end up being
Clinton's lasting legacy in this field _ the expansion of NATO and
the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   To win congressional approval for admitting three former Soviet
bloc countries into NATO, the White House waged a year-long
campaign, pulling together an influential bipartisan congressional
group as a beachhead and wooing lawmakers with dozens of classified
briefings. Similarly, with the free trade agreement, the White
House _ which started out way behind in all the vote tallies _
worked the Congress diligently, with all the care usually accorded
voters in an early presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, say veterans of Washington foreign policy battles,
Clinton was severely handicapped this time around by his poisonous
relations with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't impeach him on Monica, they impeached him on the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,'' said Leslie Gelb, president of the
Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Gelb was an assistant secretary of state in the Carter
administration and worked on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty,
known as SALT. Even with reasonable relations with the Congress, he
said, the Clinton White House needed to start a year ago to help
lawmakers understand the intricacies of the test ban treaty. Back
in 1977, he recalled, more than two years of heavy lobbying on
Capitol Hill was not sufficient to convince Congress of the need
for SALT, and the vote on the Carter-era treaty was eventually
delayed until the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to give billions of dollars to foreigners and make
treaties that limit our military _ it takes a lot of work and
education,'' said Gelb. ``Unless people on the Hill can figure out
how they can sell these proposals to their constituents, they are
not going to vote for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran of foreign policy fights, Thomas A. Dine, a
former executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee, said the White House had shown ``arrogance'' in not
preparing the Senate better for the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The highly partisan atmosphere in Congress had much to do with
the defeat, but so did the White House's failure to fight with more
determination, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a situation before where presidential
prerogative hasn't mattered,'' said Dine, who is now president of
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Democrats and Republicans painted a forlorn
picture of what lies ahead for Clinton's foreign policy goals. His
standing has been diminished abroad, as well as in Congress, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   He is not helped, they added, by a scarred foreign policy team.
The national security adviser, Sandy Berger, was unable to fend off
the Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott on last week's
treaty vote. And Secretary of State Madeleine Albright contributed
what was described in Congress as an unimpressive last-minute
lobbying effort.
</P>
<P>
   On China, Democrats in Congress are complaining of timid
leadership by a White House apparently fearful of domestic
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that Clinton would have a tough time getting
anywhere near the money he promised to the Israelis and
Palestinians for last year's Middle East peace agreement at Wye,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of his second term, Clinton said a ``strategic
partnership'' with China was a priority. Part of the strategy was
to bring China into the World Trade Organization. But Clinton
botched this by turning down an offer in April from Chinese Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji. White House staff said that Zhu's offer to
ease China's trade restrictions would not have passed muster in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate aides said that a bipartisan whip count at the time
of Zhu's visit showed that 56 senators of 87 polled were in favor
of Zhu's proposal. Prospects in the House were then also fair,
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the chance of mustering votes for permanent trading status
for China _ which must accompany its entry into the World Trade
Organization _ has evaporated, legislative staff said.
</P>
<P>
   The battered relationship with China is threatened by a
legislative initiative known as the Taiwan Security Enhancement
Act, which calls for increased military assistance to Taiwan. China
vehemently opposes the proposal, and has said its passage would be
close to intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the bill is gathering surprising steam, the White
House has refused to lobby against it, a Demoocratic aide said.
``They haven't lobbied because they don't want to be put in the
position of appearing to favor China,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The prize that Clinton most covets _ a White House ceremony
sealing the end of the Middle East conflict with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shaking
hands _ looks distant. His ultimate dream is to include the Syrian
leader, Hafiz Assad, as well.
</P>
<P>
   But Assad is being more recalcitrant than expected, and Israel's
demands for U.S. funds for security needs in the event of a
withdrawal from the Golan Heights are probably more than the
Congress could bear. Overall, the comprehensive Middle East peace
agreement that Barak says he wants by next September would cost
tens of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the administration is not having any luck in budging the
Congress to agree to the $1.2 billion promised to the Israelis and
the $400,000 pledged to the Palestinians last year at Wye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year is going to be very difficult to do anything on
foreign policy that doesn't require congressional action,'' Gelb
said. ``Most things need congressional action and money.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Step outside the United States for even a few days,
and the country has never looked more powerful: An economy that
won't quit, a military that has never faced fewer direct
challenges, a popular and business culture that has become the
world's most eagerly-sought export.
</P>
<P>
   But take one step back into Washington and it's easy to wonder
if you are talking about the same country. The president of the
most powerful nation at its most powerful moment has rarely looked
weaker than he did last week, when the Senate overwhelmingly
defeated the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton responded with an hour-long recitation of the
dangers of a ``new isolationism.'' Republicans shot back that
Clinton had cynically sought to turn a popular but hard-to-enforce
treaty into a political weapon. Bickering along these lines will
doubtless go on for months. But it masks the real debate.
</P>
<P>
   The test ban treaty was only the latest of a number of divisive
issues in the capital that share a common subtext: An argument not
over whether the United States is strong, but over how it should
use its power. Should it strut the global beach alone, or leverage
that power by accepting restraints on its freedom to act?
</P>
<P>
   It is that debate that has eroded the ``vital center'' that
Clinton talks about so often in his laments about the disappearance
of bipartisanship in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself, who has been episodic in focusing on foreign
policy, has ranged all over the map on this question. He preaches
cooperation one day and acts unilaterally the next _ whether the
issue is swatting Saddam Hussein or slapping huge tariffs on
low-cost Japanese steel. Usually, though, he has come down on the
side of power-sharing, either pressing for more arms control
accords even if that means a slow deterioration of the American
nuclear fleet, or granting more power to the World Trade
Organization even if sometimes strikes down American laws.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years battles have gradually gotten more and
more vociferous, as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty showed. Now
it has turned into an open fight, bound to haunt Clinton as he
finishes the last 15 months of his term. It is also certain to
plague his successor in a city where the consensus about U.S.
responsibilities in the world has splintered.
</P>
<P>
   It is a battle in which Clinton has steadily been losing ground.
In his first term he won over moderate Republicans to push through
the North American Free Trade Agreement and the global trade treaty
that created the World Trade Organization. True, these victories
came only after desperate legislative battles, but unlike the test
ban treaty, they were at least fought out in hundreds of hours of
hearings and public debate. But lately, with the exception of the
war in Kosovo, he has been unable to stitch together any kind of
majority for his international initiatives. He was unable even to
convince his own party to vote to give him authority to negotiate
new trade treaties _ a reminder that, for all his denunciations of
isolationism Thursday, most of the economic isolationists in
Congress are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And now, in a treaty that involved national security rather than
economic prosperity, the culmination of an idea whose intellectual
roots go back to Eisenhower Republicans, he became the first
president since Woodrow Wilson to face outright rejection of a
major international accord. The fact that Democrats and Republicans
were unable to agree on the obvious face-saving compromise _ a
delay of the vote until after the presidential election _ seems to
prove that the politics of post-Cold War Washington really are
different. ``It's inconceivable,'' one of Clinton's top advisers
said, ``that this would have been the outcome if the country still
felt under an imminent threat from a major enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many of those who had doubts about the treaty and thus
voted against it would have preferred to see it postponed, amended
or at least fully aired in hearings rather than killed. Moderate
Republicans who voted no like John McCain, a presidential
candidate, were clearly uncomfortable with the message that the
treaty's rejection sent around the world. ``There has always been
an isolationist wing in our party and they were transcendent in the
'20s and '30s,'' McCain said Friday, trying to distance himself
from that group as fast as he could. ``It's still there, it will
always be there, yet I have every confidence that the majority will
take an international viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the instinct in evidence on the Senate floor on
Wednesday night was less about isolationism than about
unilateralism _ preserving America's ability to use its power
unchallenged. In the case of the test ban treaty, that means
retaining an ability to go back to traditional deterrence,
constantly improving America's nuclear arsenal and forcing a
resurgent Russia or an ambitious China to fear a financially
ruinous arms race. After all, the Soviet Union went that route and
bankrupted itself along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Republican party has ever been or is now a
party of isolationism,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, a fellow at the
Council on Foreign Relations. Many of the Republicans who voted
against the treaty, he noted, rank among the Senate's strongest
internationalists. ``But there is a very strong unilateralist
impulse manifesting itself. That's very different. It's not opposed
to foreign entanglements, it just sends a message: `Don't tie our
hands.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued vociferously against that approach during his
press conference Thursday, warning that if an anti-test ban treaty
president ever gets elected (he named no names, but clearly had
George W. Bush Jr. in mind) ``we'll have China testing; we'll have
India testing; we'll have Pakistan testing.'' The result, he
argued, would be a return to an economically destructive arms race.
Sooner or later, he predicted, Republicans would be pressing for
``30 or 40 or 50 billion a year'' in additional defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   He may be right. But it is also possible that the lessons of the
Cold War run deep, and countries now feel far more competitive
pressure than they did a decade ago to invest that money in their
economic well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same moment that Clinton is talking about isolation,
American foreign investment is off the charts, American economic
engagement around the world is breaking all records,'' said Jeffrey
Garten, a former undersecretary of commerce and now dean of the
Yale School of Management. ``In some subtle way, this has
ricocheted back to Washington, and perhaps there are a lot of
people who feel that you can reject an arms control treaty and
still not be withdrawing from the world.''

NEW LEADER IN PAKISTAN DECLARES A GOAL OF CREDIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TIM WEINER and STEVE LeVINE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Pakistan's new military ruler is promising
to give the people what they want _ an end to the country's chronic
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, Pakistan's self-proclaimed chief
executive, who by his own admission has little political
experience, will pledge ``credibility, transparency and
accountability in running state affairs,'' the army said in a
prepared statement. Apparently still preparing his speech,
Musharraf tentatively rescheduled for Sunday an address to the
nation he was supposed to deliver Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Accountability, in Pakistan's political lexicon, means cleaning
up political corruption, and this nation gained a reputation in the
1990s as one of the most corrupt countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   That reputation grew during the two and a half years that Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif spent in power before he was overthrown on
Tuesday by the army, led by Musharraf, who has suspended the
constitution, dismissed the Parliament and established martial law
in everything but name.
</P>
<P>
   The army has started to put the principle of accountability into
practice by rounding up dozens of politicians and bureaucrats. The
terms of their detention are being publicly described as
``protective custody'' and ``house arrest.'' Their government files
are being seized, and the bank accounts of hundreds of politicians
have been frozen, suggesting a deep investigation into a
long-suspected plundering of public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among those arrested are Sharif, some of his ministers,
including his brother, Shahbaz, and his key national and local
political allies. He is widely suspected in Pakistan of using his
power to enrich himself, his father, his brother, their extended
family and their friends with government loans, funds and
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif is said to be under detention in his hometown of Lahore
and, although his precise whereabouts are unknown, the army says he
is alive and well. On Friday, the army occupied the offices and
seized the records of his family's main business, Ittefaq
Foundries.
</P>
<P>
   The army says it is questioning him with an eye toward charging
him with a conspiracy to kill Musharraf. It suspects that Sharif
and his chief intelligence officer, Gen. Khwaja Ziauddin, barred a
civilian airliner carrying Musharraf and at least 190 other
passengers from landing in Pakistan on Tuesday night, shortly after
Sharif secretly appointed his intelligence aide to replace
Musharraf as army chief. The plane landed with seven minutes' worth
of fuel left in its tanks, the army says.
</P>
<P>
   The detentions of Sharif and his aides have been hugely popular
in Pakistan, even among the most outspoken liberals, some of whom
were arrested themselves by the ousted government.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in these situations is that when the bad guys get
thrown out, whoever throws them out looks like good guys.'' said
Najam Sethi, the editor of The Friday Times, who was arrested,
imprisoned and beaten for criticizing the government earlier this
year. Arresting politicians, he said, ``is the only plank through
which these people _ whom I am calling reluctant coup-makers _ can
get and keep good will.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is apparently not Musharraf's only plank. During meetings
with the ambassadors of the United States, Britain and Japan on
Friday and Saturday, he made sincere-sounding pledges to enact
economic reforms and to begin to move the country back to a
civilian government _ perhaps too slowly for the West's taste.
Those moves are expected to include the appointment of a variety of
civilians to positions of power, perhaps joined as a kind of
council of elders or a formally appointed caretaker government,
well before any new elections are held.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The military regime has to walk a fine line between its desire
to run the country on its own terms and its need to placate the
United States, Britain and institutions like the International
Monetary Fund so that aid and loan programs that are crucial to
Pakistan's shaky economy might resume.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday and Saturday, the general huddled with his military
chiefs, seeking ways to consolidate his power without appearing to
the outside world as a dictator, while drawing up plans to purge
Pakistan of its political past. An address to the nation that he
had scheduled for Saturday evening was postponed until at least
Sunday _ evidently because he was not ready to make his intentions
for the nation known.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf's sole public appearance since he seized power on
Tuesday was a brief speech, in English, at 3 a.m. on Wednesday. His
true audience for that address was the world outside Pakistan, not
his own people.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani public, like the rest of the world, knows little
of Musharraf. Acquaintances, including several retired senior
military officers who served with him, describe him as a
politically moderate figure and personally modest man who smokes
and occasionally takes a drink, despite public proscriptions
against alcohol in Pakistan, an Islamic country. Even after
becoming army chief last October, he frequented restaurants with
friends _ behavior almost unheard of in power circles here. He is
not thought to favor the religious extremism to which a growing
number of army officers adhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's frank, decisive, professionally competent,'' said Talat
Massoud, a retired lieutenant general who served as defense
minister from 1988 to 1990 and knew Pakistan's new ruler as a
senior officer. ``His training was as a commando, you know, and a
good commando will take on a mission even if there is only a 20
percent chance of success.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds may be that long or longer for Musharraf. Though his
coup was overwhelmingly popular in a nation weary of corrupt and
incompetent politicians, long years of military rule in Pakistan's
recent past are a bitter memory for many. And to succeed, he will
have to find a way to make this nation stop failing, economically
and politically.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the general, despite his autocratic means, has
the popular support to seek an end to political corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here aren't really concerned with democracy
anymore,'' Sethi said. ``They have seen what kind of democracy
there is here. What we want is stability and for the courts to call
up these crooks, for the courts to be cleaned up, and for
independent judges to do justice.''

<P>
   Basketball star Wilt Chamberlain, who died last week of a heart
attack at the age of 63, had a taciturn demeanor as a player, but
he was best-known off the court for bragging in his autobiography
that he had had sex with some 20,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that wasn't nearly the half of Chamberlain's boasting
in ``A View From Above'' (Villard Books, 1991), which opened with
his disclaimer that although he was a big man, ``I am certainly not
 &UR; the &LR;  Big Man'' _ God _ in case anyone was confused.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most curious are Chamberlain's comments on race. At
one point in the book, he is derisive toward Al Campanis, the Los
Angeles Dodgers executive forced to resign in 1987 after he said on
national television that blacks ``may not have the necessities''
for management in baseball, and that blacks aren't good swimmers
``because they don't have the buoyancy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Chamberlain asks why the Dodgers had no black
third-base coaches under Campanis. Was it because blacks ``can't
say stop?'' he asked. ``Or because they don't know when to go
home?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at another point, Chamberlain offers his own views about
racial differences between black and white basketball players,
which attracted very little attention at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is because there were juicier headlines in a former
star athlete claiming to have bedded 20,000 women, and because
Chamberlain was not an executive in a major sport using racial
stereotypes on ``Nightline'' to justify racial disparities in
management.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Chamberlain wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Men of color seem to be blessed with specific physical
attributes that benefit them in several sports, particularly
basketball. They have explosive muscle power that translates into
speed, quickness, and jumping ability (three major ingredients
needed to be a good jock, a good basketball player in particular).
</P>
<P>
   ``And there is another element that makes men of color tend to
stand out above the rest. For lack of a better word, let's call it
`flair' _ which translates into showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``A perfect example of this can be seen if you examine the
playing styles of the two best passers in the game of basketball
today, Magic Johnson and John Stockton,'' Chamberlain continued.
``At present, Stockton out-assists Magic _ on a per game basis _ by
approximately one assist. But Magic has that flair and Stockton
doesn't. It makes Magic appear as if he's doing much more than
Stockton. It's not ability, it's style. And in basketball, men of
color have all the style. Think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds, ``I suppose this flair can be traced back to
environmental conditioning or heritage or even to the Harlem
Globetrotters, the true forefathers of all the showmanship that has
become the trademark of so many stars _ all men of color _ in the
NBA.''

   It took Grantland Rice three tries to get it right. In 1922,
writing about the Notre Dame-Army football game, he led with
``Notre Dame's attack is more like a modern war offensive than
anything we have seen.'' Nope. In 1923, again covering the Irish
and the Cadets, he began, ``Brazil can cheer about its coffee ...''
Definitely not.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 18, 1924 _ almost exactly 75 years ago _ he finally
found the right rhythm and imagery and struck hard and clean as a
Knute Rockne-coached linebacker:
</P>
<P>
   ``Outlined against a blue, gray October sky, the Four Horsemen
rode again. In dramatic lore, they were known as Famine,
Pestilence, Destruction, and Death. These are only aliases. Their
real names are Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley, and Layden. They
formed the crest of the South Bend cyclone before which another
fighting Army team was swept over the precipice of the Polo Grounds
this afternoon. ...''
</P>
<P>
   In a few swift, polished sentences _ and with an assist from a
photograph _ Rice changed his own life, his profession, the course
of college football and the character of American leisure culture.
</P>
<P>
   The 1920s were the golden age of myth-making sports journalism.
A handful of talented writers who found other paths to literary
fame blocked began to notice, as indeed their editors had already
noticed, that a rising middle class was responding more to the
exploits of Jack Dempsey, Babe Ruth and Bobby Jones than to what
would come to be known as ``hard'' news stories.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gallico of the New York Daily News, who later went on to
better things, admitted to being a ``Gee-Whizzer'' _ one of the new
breed of sportswriter who wrote in ``the most florid and exciting
prose.''
</P>
<P>
   Grantland Rice, writing for the New York Herald Tribune, was the
king of the Gee-Whizzers. As Murray Sperber wrote in ``Shake Down
the Thunder,'' his history of Notre Dame football, ``Each day he
flung out metaphors about athletes and sports events and, indeed,
some of his words stick to the American psyche. ... The vast
majority of his figures of speech quickly disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   The lines that stick with us today were a happy combination of
skill and circumstance. To begin with, Rice had picked the right
sport, and the right team. The rise of football _ and college
football in the 1920s and for several decades thereafter  &UR; was &LR; 
football _ coincided with the rise of the sports pages and the
Gee-Whizzers. Some historians have called the explosion of football
popularity a newspaper phenomenon. College football had been a
small-time sport with local appeal at best before near-hysterical
coverage made it a national game in the rank of, if not actually on
a par with, big-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Sperber relates an incident between the Notre Dame football
coach, Knute Rockne, and a journalist that makes the point: ``Tut,
tut, Rockne,'' the writer responded when the Notre Dame coach
complained about the paper's football coverage. ``You know damn
well that were it not for newspapers, not five hundred people would
be interested in Notre Dame, Nebraska, or the whole kit and
kaboodle of football teams.''
</P>
<P>
   If that was true before 1924, it wasn't true afterward.
</P>
<P>
   College football and sports pages combined to make each other,
and both helped to create Grantland Rice. He got a big boost, too,
from the night editor of the Herald Tribune, who loved the lead for
Rice's 1924 Notre Dame-Army story and put it on the front page of
the Sunday morning paper. Other papers picked up the story.
</P>
<P>
   Today, hardly anyone remembers the actual game. It wasn't even
the biggest story in college football that day: Red Grange had
scored five touchdowns against Michigan, and most papers, including
Rice's own, considered that game the bigger event. Notre Dame's
13-7 victory wasn't even its most impressive win that season.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice, a friend of Knute Rockne, correctly perceived that
Notre Dame would be the football team with national appeal, and for
thousands of fans that Sunday, and for millions more who would read
the story in weeks and months and, as it appeared in anthologies of
sportswriting, years to come, that fall Saturday would forever be
the day the Four Horsemen rode.
</P>
<P>
   George Strickler, a Notre Dame press assistant, gave Rice his
inspiration when he likened the Irish backfield to the stars of the
Rudolph Valentino film ``The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.''
Rice took the ball, as it were, from there. Strickler then picked
it up and ran it for another score when he messaged back to South
Bend, Ind., for a photographer to shoot the Notre Dame backfield on
horses. It was a cute picture, but for many it only seemed to
diminish the myth _ in truth, the four heroes looked a little
uneasy on horses. The picture was not worth the thousand words Rice
wrote. Actually, it didn't measure up to the 12 words of his lead
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outlined against blue, gray October sky ...'' What was Rice's
vantage point? Looking up from the turf of the football field? It
must have seemed so to newspaper readers all over the country to
whom the Four Horsemen must have seemed larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   Within three decades, TV would make athletes smaller than life.
Rarely again would sportswriters see athletes in such mythic (and
unrealistic) proportions. The athletes would be as great or greater
than Dempsey, Ruth, Jones and the Four Horsemen, but fans would
watch them over and over on TV and have no need of poetic writing
to make their feats seem memorable.

BLOWN TO BITS: CYBERWARFARE BREAKS THE RULES OF MILITARY
ENGAGEMENT

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen Years ago, in the movie ``WarGames,'' Matthew Broderick
played a computer hacker who electronically ferrets his way into
the Pentagon's Norad early warning system inside Cheyenne Mountain,
Colo., and almost starts World War III by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the military finally struck back. The Pentagon
created a new military center to harness the nation's disparate
cyberwarfare forces under the Air Force Space Command at Peterson
Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. That followed the public
acknowledgment by Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, that the United States played hacker itself earlier this
year _ waging a keyboard war against Serbian computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond challenging America's own military culture and requiring
sophisticated technology, cyberwarfare raises a fundamental
philosophical question. The biggest challenge that such warfare may
pose for democratic societies is that it further blurs the line
between military and nonmilitary targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cyberwarfare involves deliberately targeting noncombatants,''
said Mark Rasch, a former federal prosecutor and an expert on legal
issues in computer security. ``Frequently, you're not going after a
government or military or some strategic target.'' The target might
instead be a public utility.
</P>
<P>
   The new command's first mission will be to coordinate the
defense of the military's computer networks against foreign threats
and cyberterrorists. Soon after the mission will expand to include
offense: Joint Task Force Computer Network Attack, in Pentagon
jargon, designed to conduct wartime military operations against
computer networks in enemy countries.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of an information-war fighting capability to the
Pentagon's quiver takes activities that have largely been confined
to covert military and intelligence operations and makes them part
of the nation's military chain of command.

as the world's most technically advanced nation, the United States

<P>
   But the real-world challenge faced by the military is likely to
be more subtle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat is going to be death by a thousand cuts, rather

``There will be a little bit of this and a little bit of that.''
</P>
<P>
   This ghost-in-the-machine threat is perhaps the military's worst
nightmare and also the one that a closed and secretive military

   ``We think we can throw technology at this but it's not a
technology problem at all,'' said Ronald Knecht, a former Pentagon
official who helped develop information warfare policy for three
decades and who is now senior vice president for corporate
development at Science Applications International Corp., a large
military contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, he said, is to change a military culture that has
fought wars with bombs and tanks into one that fights with bits and
bytes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preparing for cyberwar will force the nation to rethink the
way it fights wars,'' said Steven Lukasik, a military analyst at
the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford
University and a former director of the Pentagon's Advanced
Research Projects Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trained to fight nuclear wars where static defenses
are fatal,'' he said. ``But in information warfare we have to
rethink everything. It may be that Maginot Lines have basically
gotten a bad name.'' In other words, building impenetrable
electronic walls may be a more effective tactic in cyberwarfare.
</P>
<P>
   A deeper challenge for the Pentagon may be keeping pace with
Silicon Valley's fast-paced consumer technology companies. Until
the end of the Cold War, the most powerful computer technology
would trickle down from a handful of defense contractors and
supercomputer companies financed by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, however, the most powerful computer
technologies are increasingly made by companies that make products
that go under Christmas trees. To cope with the consumer technology
challenge, the CIA announced plans this month to set up a venture
capital fund to gain quicker access to state-of-art technologies
being incubated in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon's problem may be compounded because the
technology is the same as in consumer products but the rules of
cyberwarfare are different, said Knecht of Stanford. He said a
military commander should expect an attack that blocks access to
his computer networks ``and he should assume that somebody who has
approved access to his networks is working for the other side _ and
still be ready to fight a war.''

<P>
   Sixteen Years ago, in the movie ``WarGames,'' Matthew Broderick
played a computer hacker who electronically ferrets his way into
the Pentagon's Norad early warning system inside Cheyenne Mountain,
Colo., and almost starts World War III by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the military finally struck back. The Pentagon
created a new military center to harness the nation's disparate
cyberwarfare forces under the Air Force Space Command at Peterson
Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. That followed the public
acknowledgment by Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, that the United States played hacker itself earlier this
year _ waging a keyboard war against Serbian computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond challenging America's own military culture and requiring
sophisticated technology, cyberwarfare raises a fundamental
philosophical question. The biggest challenge that such warfare may
pose for democratic societies is that it further blurs the line
between military and nonmilitary targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cyberwarfare involves deliberately targeting noncombatants,''
said Mark Rasch, a former federal prosecutor and an expert on legal
issues in computer security. ``Frequently, you're not going after a
government or military or some strategic target.'' The target might
instead be a public utility.
</P>
<P>
   The new command's first mission will be to coordinate the
defense of the military's computer networks against foreign threats
and cyberterrorists. Soon after the mission will expand to include
offense: Joint Task Force Computer Network Attack, in Pentagon
jargon, designed to conduct wartime military operations against
computer networks in enemy countries.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of an information-war fighting capability to the
Pentagon's quiver takes activities that have largely been confined
to covert military and intelligence operations and makes them part
of the nation's military chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new center is a public acknowledgment that
as the world's most technically advanced nation, the United States
is also potentially the most vulnerable to foreign cyberthreats.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of simultaneous computer network attacks against

Harbor in which the nation is paralyzed without a single bullet
ever being fired.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a dramatic reversal of previous policy, the United
States is now offering to help Russia complete a large missile
tracking radar if Moscow agrees to renegotiate what both countries
long saw as a landmark arms control agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The confidential proposal to help the Russians finish their
radar near Irkutsk, Siberia, is part of an intensive American
campaign laying the groundwork for a defense against potential
missile attacks from North Korea and other nations, Russian and
American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Such a nationwide defense is prohibited by the 1972
Antiballistic Missile Treaty, a pact viewed for more than 25 years
as the bedrock of arms control. Moscow has so far refused to alter
it, and announced on Friday _ two days after the Senate voted down
a nuclear test ban treaty _ that it would work with China to seek
broad support at the United Nations against American efforts to
alter the accord.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly heated dispute over antimissile defenses comes
as the structure of arms control appears to be under siege. Last
week's Senate vote drew widespread criticism around the world.
Russia's Parliament, meanwhile, has blocked progress on further
arms reductions by failing to ratify the START II treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Russia's war in Chechnya means that Moscow has
hundreds more armored vehicles in the Northern Caucusus than it is
permitted to under a key 1990 accord limiting ground troops and
conventional weapons in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be argued that rogue states were the main threat to
strategic stability,'' said Sergei Rogov, the director of the
U.S.-Canada Institute. ``Now it is the United States and Russia who
refuse to ratify and implement agreements and who violate their
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior American officials insist that the Clinton administration
is not aiming to nullify the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. Rather,
they maintain, the goal is to update the accord so that the United
States can defend itself against new missile threats while at the
same time avoiding a new arms race with Russia and China. A formal
decision on whether to proceed with antimissile defenses is to be
made by next summer, based on technical, economic and arms control
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian officials insist that Washington has vastly
exaggerated the missile threat arising from undeclared or potential
nuclear powers and say that weakening the ABM treaty would be a
reckless move.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was a
disaster,'' said Grigory V. Berdennikof, a senior arms control
specialist at Russia's Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happens to the ABM treaty,'' he said, ``it will be a
quadruple disaster. The pattern is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ABM treaty was concluded, the argument against
development of national antimissile defense systems in Russia and
the United States was that they would encourage both sides to
accumulate more arms to penetrate such shields.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union built a radar in the 1980s at Krasnoyarsk,
Siberia, to fill a gap in its radar coverage, the United States
argued successfully that it was a violation of the treaty and
pressed the Russians to dismantle it.
</P>
<P>
   In January, however, the Clinton administration took a different
tack. President Clinton sent President Boris Yeltsin a letter
asking Russia to renegotiate the treaty to permit a limited system
of defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The administration insisted the accord had to be updated because
nations like North Korea and Iran were developing the means to
manufacture ocean-spanning ballistic missiles. American
intelligence analysts revised their estimates after they failed to
anticipate North Korea's unsuccessful effort to launch a tiny
satellite into space in 1998 using a three-stage missile.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the next 15 years, the United States will mostly face
ICBM threats from Russia, China, and North Korea, probably from
Iran, and possibly from Iraq,'' American intelligence experts said
in a report last month.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Clinton administration, however, say politics was
the driving force behind the proposal. They charge that Clinton is
trying to insure that Vice President Al Gore can not be accused of
being soft on defense in the coming presidential race by rushing
ahead with plans for an antimissile system that may not be
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed defense is fundamentally very fragile,'' said
Theodore A. Postol, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. ``It seems to be a case of subordinating national
security to domestic politics.''
</P>
<P>
   With strong support for an antimissile defense in the
Republican-dominated Congress, financing is not a problem. The hard
part is persuading Russia and China that they should cooperate with
the American antimissile plan and not respond by expanding their
nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has held a series of
high-level meetings with the Russians, including a session this
week in Helsinki with Grigory Mamedov, a senior official at
Russia's Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   By outlining their plans, the Americans are seeking to reassure
the Russians that the proposed missile defense is not aimed at
them.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian and American officials familiar with the
talks, the first phase of the American antimissile system is to be
completed by 2005. It involves building a powerful new
battle-management radar in Alaska and deploying up to 100
antimissile interceptors there. American early warning radars in
Greenland and Britain and on the east and west coasts of the United
States would also be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   American officials assert the system would be able to stop a
limited attack involving relatively unsophisticated missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase is to be completed by 2010, and could involve
construction of a similar radar at Grand Forks, N.D., and
deployment of 100 interceptors there.
</P>
<P>
   This level of defense, American officials maintain, would enable
the United States to protect itself against a limited missile
attack that involved several tens of missiles with more
sophisticated warheads and decoys.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense could easily be swamped by Russia's vast
arsenal, thus preserving strategic equilibrium between Washington
and Moscow, American officials say.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to outlining the proposed missile defense,
Washington has sought to reassure the Russians by offering
cooperation in several areas.
</P>
<P>
   An offer to help the cash-strapped Russians complete a large
radar at Mishelevka, 60 miles northwest of Irkutsk, is included _
which could cost many millions of dollars. Oriented to the
southeast, the radar covers North Korea, among other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have also suggested that Washington might
upgrade a Russian-controlled radar at Lyaki in Azerbaijan. Oriented
toward the south, the radar covers Iran and other Middle Eastern
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the American plan, the Lyaki station might be jointly
manned with the Russians. But the proposal has yet to be negotiated
with the government of Azerbaijan, and key details about American
access to Russian radar data have not been worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Other proposals include Russian visits to American early warning
radar stations and, perhaps, access to their data, including that
from the new radar to be built in Alaska. American officials have
also proposed joint computer simulations of antimissile systems and
possible collaboration in deploying satellite systems.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Russians have said that weakening the ABM treaty is
too high a price to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are open to cooperation,'' said Berdennikof, the Russian
arms control specialist. ``But if our cooperation means changing
the ABM treaty our answer is `thanks but no thanks.'''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials insist the United States has exaggerated North
Korea's capacity to develop long-range missiles while minimizing
the other forms of political and military leverage Washington has
over North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's major concern is the effect of the American plan on
its nuclear arsenal. Russian officials fear the costly new radars
and command control system the United States might erect in the
next century will become the building blocks for a more
comprehensive antimissile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia is too poor to engage in that kind of arms race,
the only way it could maintain a strategic balance with the United
States would be to cast aside the agreements it negotiated with
Washington in the past and build up its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   One relatively cheap countermeasure would be deployment of
land-based missiles with multiple warheads _ either old SS-18
missiles or new Topol-M missiles _ a move that would undo one of
the main achievements of arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials also say they have already begun to consult
with China about possible political and military cooperation in the
event that the United States withdraws from the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence experts say that China will have ``tens of
missiles'' that can reach the United States by 2015, a threat
especially vulnerable to American advances in antimissile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official dismissed many of the Russian
objections to renegotiating the ABM treaty as public posturing
intended to weaken Western support for missile defenses and said
that it differed from what he called the businesslike tone of
private meetings. Still, there seems little doubt that the dispute
over an antimissile system will escalate sharply in coming months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says it will not make a formal
decision on whether to proceed with its anti-missile program before
next summer, although it is widely presumed it will go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is determined by intelligence estimates and budgetary
procedures in the United States. But it means that the decision is
likely to fall on the eve of the Russian presidential election,
insuring that the issue gets added to the growing litany of bitter
American-Russian disputes.

<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush gets no higher praise from President
Clinton's devotees than when they applaud the Republican for
proving himself a deft triangulator. But asked about his
triangulation skills over lunch at the Governor's Mansion in Austin
last week, Bush looked as if he wanted to smash the sweet potato
pie into his questioner's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what that means,'' Bush bristled. ``This is some
invented word. I don't know what triangulation stands for. It's new
in the political jargon. What does it mean? Triangulation?
Seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that triangulation, in shorthand, has something do to with
satisfying everyone, Bush grew even more impatient: ``Sounds like
somebody trying to insult me then.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what it means, according to Dick Morris, the former
Clinton political adviser who dreamed up the concept for his client
in 1995: ``Triangulation is a process of taking the best ideas from
each party and combining them into a coherent policy and program.
It is not just splitting the difference, but molding a creative
synthesis which rises above the doctrine of either party.''
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, Bush now has been branded by pundits and
political professionals _ even by White House officials _ as a
triangulator because in recent days he has distanced himself from
his party's congressional leadership _ a pattern that has marked
the Clinton presidency. Such positioning by Bush, Morris argued,
demonstrates ``why he is winning'' and, in his view, will be
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is combining Democratic ideals like compassion, income
redistribution, help for the poor,'' he said, ``with Republican
ways of doing it, like using faith-based organizations, charities
and tax incentives to achieve these goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Bush wants, of course, is to be accused of what
even Morris acknowledges are the crass (though successful)
political strategies of Clinton. One of Bush's most reliable
applause lines in his stump speech is an unambiguous dig at the
president: ``I won't use my office as a mirror to reflect public
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet maybe Bush had a point when he grimaced at the notion of
triangulation. The term has been defined, perhaps too broadly, as a
catch-all for any politician who diverges from the doctrine of his
or her party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Triangulation is probably a term we could do without,'' said
Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. ``Dick Morris gets too much credit for way too many
things. You can explain what happened without invoking any
triangles.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are major differences between the Clinton and
Bush approaches. Unlike Clinton, who actually pressed for
Republican positions on issues like welfare, trade and the death
penalty, Bush's outreach has been largely rhetorical.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush delivered a speech about education recently, the
passage that captured the attention was his broadside at the
Republican Party. He made no mention of his support for vouchers,
which are controversial yet popular among conservatives _ and would
give federal money to parents for private tuition. But, in a subtle
move to reassure conservatives, the supporting documentation
explicitly outlined a voucher proposal.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, careful not to put off abortion-rights supporters,
never utters the word abortion. Instead, he uses code phrases about
babies to reassure conservatives. When he addressed the Christian
Coalition this month, Bush did not appreciably change his theme.
But abortion opponents were reassured by the man who introduced
Bush, Jay Sekulow, and spoke passionately (and bluntly) about the
governor's opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's oratory criticizing congressional Republicans for
balancing the federal budget ``on the backs of the poor'' is
reminiscent of Clinton in one instance: when, during the 1992
campaign, Clinton sought to show he was a new kind of Democrat by
repudiating Sister Souljah, a race-baiting rapper. Back then,
Morris had not even invented the term triangulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sister Souljah and `backs of the poor' are very good
parallels,'' said Fred Greenstein, a historian at Princeton
University. ``In each case, you've got someone at the core of your
party who has no other place to go and is controversial to people
at the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that triangulation may be too easy a buzzword.
``It's kind of slippery to hang it exclusively on triangulation
because the more you look at it the more it fades,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that presidents and presidential candidates have
long sought to broaden their appeal on the backs of their own party
faithful. A maxim of politics is that presidential elections are
always won at the center.

political professionals _ even by White House officials _ as a
triangulator because in recent days he has distanced himself from
his party's congressional leadership _ a pattern that has marked
the Clinton presidency. Such positioning by Bush, Morris argued,
demonstrates ``why he is winning'' and, in his view, will be
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is combining Democratic ideals like compassion, income
redistribution, help for the poor,'' he said, ``with Republican
ways of doing it, like using faith-based organizations, charities
and tax incentives to achieve these goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Bush wants, of course, is to be accused of what
even Morris acknowledges are the crass (though successful)
political strategies of Clinton. One of Bush's most reliable
applause lines in his stump speech is an unambiguous dig at the
president: ``I won't use my office as a mirror to reflect public
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet maybe Bush had a point when he grimaced at the notion of
triangulation. The term has been defined, perhaps too broadly, as a
catch-all for any politician who diverges from the doctrine of his
or her party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Triangulation is probably a term we could do without,'' said
Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. ``Dick Morris gets too much credit for way too many
things. You can explain what happened without invoking any
triangles.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are major differences between the Clinton and
Bush approaches. Unlike Clinton, who actually pressed for
Republican positions on issues like welfare, trade and the death
penalty, Bush's outreach has been largely rhetorical.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush delivered a speech about education recently, the
passage that captured the attention was his broadside at the
Republican Party. He made no mention of his support for vouchers,
which are controversial yet popular among conservatives _ and would
give federal money to parents for private tuition. But, in a subtle
move to reassure conservatives, the supporting documentation
explicitly outlined a voucher proposal.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, careful not to put off abortion-rights supporters,
never utters the word abortion. Instead, he uses code phrases about
babies to reassure conservatives. When he addressed the Christian
Coalition this month, Bush did not appreciably change his theme.
But abortion opponents were reassured by the man who introduced
Bush, Jay Sekulow, and spoke passionately (and bluntly) about the
governor's opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's oratory criticizing congressional Republicans for
balancing the federal budget ``on the backs of the poor'' is
reminiscent of Clinton in one instance: when, during the 1992
campaign, Clinton sought to show he was a new kind of Democrat by
repudiating Sister Souljah, a race-baiting rapper. Back then,
Morris had not even invented the term triangulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sister Souljah and `backs of the poor' are very good
parallels,'' said Fred Greenstein, a historian at Princeton
University. ``In each case, you've got someone at the core of your
party who has no other place to go and is controversial to people
at the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that triangulation may be too easy a buzzword.
``It's kind of slippery to hang it exclusively on triangulation
because the more you look at it the more it fades,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that presidents and presidential candidates have
long sought to broaden their appeal on the backs of their own party
faithful. A maxim of politics is that presidential elections are
always won at the center.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the term had been around when he assumed the presidency in
1841, John Tyler, a Whig, would surely have been stamped a
triangulator. His party was eager to repudiate the Andrew Jackson
era by establishing a national bank and setting high tariffs. But
Tyler, something of a renegade, vetoed bank bills proposed by his
own party and opposed the tariffs, fearing that moving against the
Jacksonian legacy too hastily would backfire on his party.
</P>
<P>
   When he ran for president in 1952, Dwight D. Eisenhower resisted
enormous pressure from Republican leaders who wanted him to run as
an isolationist and advocate rolling back the New Deal. But buoyed
by his stature and popularity as a World War II general, Eisenhower
pressed forward with his drive to moderate the party.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after Republicans lost control of Congress in the 1954
midterm elections, Eisenhower _ two years into his first term _
sounded as despondent as Clinton, who had the same thing happen to
him in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party must be known as a progressive
organization or it is sunk,'' Eisenhower wrote in his diary. ``I
believe this so emphatically that I think that far from appeasing
or reasoning with the dyed-in-the-wool reactionary fringe, we
should completely ignore it and, when necessary, repudiate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that he was elected by a frighteningly narrow margin in
1968, President Richard M. Nixon sought to broaden his appeal by
seizing the Democrats' agenda on matters like the environment,
welfare and, of course, China, which he visited as the 1972
presidential campaign was getting underway.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters are particularly troubled by the triangulation
label because it has a Machiavellian air to it. They want their
candidate to float above politics _ or, at least, appear that way.
``George W. Bush is saying what's on his mind,'' said Michigan Gov.
John Engler. ``I don't think there's any elaborate
three-dimensional game board strategy that's being played out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is no political innocent. He, too, has a pollster. He,
too, has wily political operatives. When the governor lambasted
House Republicans, he knew that keeping some distance from his
party's unpopular leaders in Washington could make him look
independent and no creature of Washington. In doing so, he also
gave a nod to the accomplishments of governors like himself. He had
the same intention when, in a subsequent speech, he declared, ``Too
often, on social issues, my party has painted an image of America
slouching toward Gomorrah.''
</P>
<P>
   Triangles or not, a challenge for Bush is not to take things too
far. By the time Tyler left the White House he had been disowned by
his own party _ and Democrats wanted nothing to do with him,
either. Neither party wanted him on its ticket in 1844.
</P>
<P>
   Nor in 1999 is President Clinton is greatly beloved in either
party.

NEW SCANDALISMS: IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR DEFINITION OF LINGUISTIC

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a recent episode of the new NBC drama ``Law &AMP;
Order: Special Victims Unit,'' a male character referred to
``getting a Lewinsky.'' Most of the audience instantly understood
what he was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Although the epilogue to the sordid impeachment scandal is still
being written _ Monica Lewinsky has accepted a $1 million weight
loss challenge from a fitness chain, Linda Tripp awaits trial in
Maryland and Kenneth Starr plans to exit the national stage this
week _ there are constant reminders of our long national nightmare
in Americans' everyday speech.
</P>
<P>
   Every era has its popular terms, but the impeachment scandal _
with its overheated mixture of sex, lies, power and audiotapes _
provided a bounty of material for Americans searching for phrases
and symbols that fit the cynical weariness of the times.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that the people whose names are being
invoked are touchy about being portrayed as caricatures for
behavior deemed ``not appropriate,'' to borrow the often-used
phrase invoked by President Clinton. For example, Dr. Bernard
Lewinsky, the father of the former White House intern, demanded an
apology last week from the ``Law &AMP; Order'' producers for using the
unseemly phrase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't they say he got a `Clinton job' rather than use my
name, and see how the White House responds to that?'' Lewinsky said
in an interview published by Variety, the entertainment-industry
trade magazine. ``I deserve an apology and so does Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Wolf, the producer of the show, refused to apologize, but
he issued a blunt written statement: ``Res ipsa loquitur,'' a
legalistic Latin expression that means, ``It speaks for itself.''
An NBC spokeswoman also defended the program's use of the Lewinsky
name: ``Some words are borne out of national news events, which is
the case with this particular word. This word has been used many
times before on television.''
</P>
<P>
   It has joined a slew of other terms and metaphors from the
scandal now in the American political and cultural lexicon. Linda
Tripp's last name is often used as a verb; to be ``Tripped,''
always with a capital T, is to be betrayed, the way Ms. Tripp
double-crossed Ms. Lewinsky by secretly tape-recording their
intimate phone discussions and turning the tapes over to the
independent counsel. Starr's name is relentlessly invoked as an
extreme example of prosecutorial overzealousness, and pundits have
compared the bespectacled, perpetually smirking prosecutor to
Inspector Javert, the obsessed detective in ``Les Miserables.''
</P>
<P>
   Even William Ginsburg, Ms. Lewinsky's first attorney, who once
managed to appear on five television programs on a single Sunday
morning, has not escaped; his name has become immortalized as a
label for a media-hogging talking head. Last summer, writer Douglas
Brinkley, who appeared on numerous television programs talking
about the death of John F. Kennedy Jr., was described by a writer
for Slate magazine as ``the William Ginsburg of the Kennedy death
circus.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one has contributed more catch-phrases to the national
conversation than Bill Clinton. In February, after the impeachment
trial in the Senate ended favorably for the president, Sen. Robert
Bennett, R-Utah, said Clinton would go down in history as ``the
most accomplished, polished liar we have ever had serving in the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The name Clinton has already gone into the lexicon as a
synonym for an elegant and well-crafted lie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the world was introduced to Monica Lewinsky,
Republicans on Capitol Hill lamented what they call
``Clinton-speak.'' In courthouses around the country, some lawyers
have used the term ``Clinton defense'' as shorthand for what one
attorney said is ``optional amnesia when testifying under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   The president is the most famous deponent of the decade; his
legalistic and linguistic maneuvers during his deposition in the
Paula Jones case and his nationally televised grand jury testimony
are admired by some defense lawyers as models of obfuscation.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers say the president's torrent of ``I don't
recalls'' and ``I don't remembers'' are common for a witness
confronted by a perjury inquiry. Lawyers point out that former
President Ronald Reagan failed to recall most details of the
Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages deal. But more than a few defense
lawyers say they can't recall a witness ever uttering Clinton's
classic dodge: ``It depends on what the definition of `is' is.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that sentence, along with ``I did not have sexual
relations with that woman,'' are among the most cited Clintonisms
from the impeachment saga. Both phrases have become more widely
quoted than Clinton's acknowledgment, during his 1992 campaign,
that while at Oxford he ``experimented with marijuana'' but
``didn't inhale.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the dean of the Annenberg School of
Public Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, predicts
that the image of a defiant Clinton emphatically denying that he
had sexual relations with ``that woman'' could come to define the
Clinton presidency, just as ``I am not a crook'' came to symbolize
President Richard M. Nixon's legacy. Ms. Jamieson explained that
Clinton's seething expression and repeated finger-jabbing are
powerful visual images that could endure for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see it being constantly referred to, even now, it
means that it has already started to move into our collective
memory,'' Ms. Jamieson said.

alone historical events that occurred as long ago as Vietnam. And
they don't care.''

   UNITED NATIONS _ For a few days last week, it took a split

Pakistan seemed to take starkly divergent paths into the next
political era. India anointed another democratically elected
government and Pakistan applauded yet another military coup.

   Half a century after the partition of British India, some
students of the area say, these two countries _ now nuclear powers
_ may be demonstrating a common trend. In their search for
identity, a new generation of Pakistanis and Indians are unveiling
the face of home-grown politics _ pure Indian and pure Pakistani,
more inward-looking, less cosmopolitan. And, perhaps, more prone to
misunderstanding each other.

   They are not alone in retreat from a cosmopolitan approach. In
the shadow of globalization, there seems to be a revival of intense
provincialism in unlikely places. Look at the U.S. Senate proudly
casting votes last week against an international effort to ban
nuclear testing, accompanied by boasts of indifference to what the
world thinks. Or at an assorted coalition of British politicians
scrambling to salvage their new-found embrace of Europe from
renewed attacks by Little Englanders. A growing number of
international agreements, not only the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, are at risk worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The developments on the Indian subcontinent and the intensity of
passions that the Senate vote stirred, in fact, were only
marginally coincidental. For it is on the subcontinent that the
probability of a devastating nuclear arms race and even the
possibility of nuclear war are arguably the highest. And the two
countries' drift away from international engagement does nothing to
lower the risks.
</P>
<P>
   American opponents of the test ban treaty were quick to read the
coup in Pakistan as another reason to doubt that any treaty regimen
would be immune to cheating. Proponents argued the opposite: that a
global treaty is the only alternative to an arms race. President
Clinton warned both India and Pakistan not to read the Senate vote
``as a sign that America doesn't care whether you resume nuclear
testing and build up your nuclear arsenals.''

   The consolidation of power by Hindus in India and the emergence
of a Muslim-inspired agenda in Pakistan are mirror images. In
India, it was the foreignness of Sonia Gandhi, who was born an
Italian, that helped bring the secular Congress Party that she led
to its lowest ebb in 50 years; in Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif was toppled in large part because he bucked Islamist
policies domestically and in relations with India.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both communities, both nations, are now at a very great
distance from the founding fathers,'' said Hamid Alvi, a political
columnist in Islamabad and a retired analyst of the Pakistani press
for the U.S. Embassy there. ``India continues with elections,
though democracy has suffered a lot there _ and the persecution of
Christians was certainly not an idea of Jawaharlal Nehru. In
Pakistan, the happenings of today are far from even the wildest
dreams of Mohammed Ali Jinnah.'' The founding generation's ideas,
he said, were both democratic and liberal.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, the appearance of Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf in power
after the overthrow of Sharif may have marked the beginning of a
new age as much as a reversion to military rule. Although the
general, who is 58, was born in New Delhi before the partition of
India in 1947, he grew up Pakistani, immersed in an Islamic
heritage that had been the cause of his family's flight from his
birthplace. There would be no shared memories of the dying days of
the British Raj to reminisce about with his military counterparts
across the border. There would be only war and hatred, and pressure
from Muslim radicals with their own agenda within the Pakistani
army.
</P>
<P>
   ``On both sides of the border there has been a qualitative
change in the military,'' said Sumit Ganguly, a visiting fellow at
Stanford University's Center for International Security and
Cooperation. Officers, he said, have become more opportunistic. And
while India has at least made recruitment more representative of
the nation's diversity, Pakistan's army is still drawn from among
the most religiously conservative ethnic groups. ``Islam,'' he
said, ``is getting into the army from the bottom up.''

   UNITED NATIONS _ For a few days last week, it took a split
screen to watch developments in South Asia, where India and
Pakistan seemed to take starkly divergent paths into the next
political era. India anointed another democratically elected
government and Pakistan applauded yet another military coup.

<P>
   Experts tend to agree that this opening to Muslim militancy is a
legacy of Gen. Mohammed Zia ul Haq, who in the 1970s and '80s
thought he could hold the Islamists at bay with concessions. This
is a mistake that Sharif also appears to have made, Alvi said _
until, under U.S. pressure, he withdrew support for a Muslim
insurgents' attack on the Kargil area of India. At that point
Islamic leaders used that and other Muslim issues to widen
opposition to Sharif's corrupt and ineffective government and help
bring it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have now coming up are people who have never known an
undivided India,'' said Paula Newberg, the author of ``Judging the
State: Courts and Constitutional Politics in Pakistan''
(Cambridge). They are, she said, far less cosmopolitan: ``They
haven't done their training in England, they haven't done their
training in the United States. Their associations are much more
within Pakistan, and a Pakistan which has seen itself as quite
beleaguered.''
</P>
<P>
   In India, the loss of Soviet sponsorship in world affairs and
the rise of Hindu nationalism have contributed to a similar
phenomenon. Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh acknowledged in an
interview at the United Nations that India turned inward at the end
of the Cold War, preoccupied with domestic problems. ``While the
rest of the world moved at great velocity,'' he said, ``India was
not part of a global transformation. Had India recognized earlier
that the Cold War had ended, it would not have been left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   In those years of introspection Singh's party, the Bharatiya
Janata Party, was growing, supported by intolerant Hindu
organizations bent on destroying other religions and sometimes even
their monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Singh has complained bitterly that the Western press is unfair
when it labels his party as Hindu nationalist, and that the party
has resisted some aggressively pro-Hindu moves that the Congress
Party governments made. There is evidence for his argument, but it
may only underline another reality: that Hindu chauvinism has been
developing for years as India moved away from the secular
philosophy and internationalist outlook of its founders. As in
Pakistan, the Bharatiya Janata Party could be crystallizing, not
creating, a nativist trend.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the man who is now the BJP's home minister, Lal
Krishna Advani, led a crusade to the North Indian town of Ayodhya
in 1990, encouraging Hindu fanatics to destroy a 16th century
mosque they say had been built over the birthplace of the god Rama.
But it was a Congress Party government that first turned over the
long-padlocked mosque, the Babri Masjid, to Hindu militants in
1983. Its destruction in 1992 was only the dramatic finale of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, political analysts keep a watchful eye on Advani,
who has in the past spoken of reassembling an ancient India, which
means bringing back Pakistan and Bangladesh into the
Hindu-dominated fold. Hindu leaders have a seamless argument for
this: All India was once Hindu, so these Muslims (or Sikhs or
Buddhists) are only converts who can be reconverted.
</P>
<P>
   And in Pakistan, Alvi says that the appeal of Islamic parties,
including to the professional middle class, derives in many cases
from a desire to complete an ``intellectual decolonization'' of the
country, a goal that can carry a threat to its inherited democratic
institutions. ``People take refuge, or they appeal to the cheap
sentiments of the public,'' he said. ``Politicians, instead of
reaching up for sublime ideas, are shrinking down to the smaller
things in life.''

<P>
   INDIA-PAKISTAN-REVIEW (United Nations) _ India and Pakistan seem
to be taking starkly divergent paths into the next political era.
India anointed another democratically elected government and
Pakistan applauded yet another military coup. But beneath the
surface, are these events as diametrically different as they seem?
These two countries may be demonstrating a common trend. In their
search for identity, a new generation of Pakistanis and Indians are
unveiling the face of home-grown, grass-roots politics _ pure
Indian and pure Pakistani, more inward-looking, less cosmopolitan.
And, perhaps, more likely to misunderstand each other. By Barbara
Crossette. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   RACE-HEALTH-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the implications of a
new study showing that even when blacks seek medical care for an
early stage of lung cancer, they were less likely than whites to
get the best treatment, surgery. As a result, the blacks were more
likely to die from their disease. By Denise Grady. (moved in `a'

<P>
   Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY-LINGO-REVIEW (Undated) _ Although the epilogue to the
impeachment scandal is still being written, there are constant
reminders of our long national nightmare in Americans' every day
speech. Every era has its popular terms, but the impeachment
scandal _ with its overheated mixture of sex, lies, power and
audiotapes _ provided a bounty of material for Americans searching
for phrases that fit the cynical weariness that permeates so much
of the nation's popular culture. By Don Van Natta.
</P>
<P>
   TRIANGULATION-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ There is no higher
praise from Bill Clinton's devotees than when they applaud George
W. Bush for proving himself a deft triangulator. Bush says he does
not know what the word means. The definition, according to Dick
Morris, the former Clinton adviser who invented the idea, is: `A
process of taking the best ideas from each party and combining them
into a coherent policy and program. It is not just splitting the
difference, but molding a creative synthesis which rises above the
doctrine of either party.' By Richard Berke.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERWARFARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The addition of an
information-war fighting capability to the U.S. military arsenal is
a watershed event, both adding cyberwar to the quiver of the
Pentagon and at the same time taking a set of military activities
which have for the last two decades largely been confined to the
black secret side of the military and intelligence world and making
them part of the military chain of command. At the same time the
new military command is a public acknowledgment that as the worlds
most technically advanced nation, the U.S. is also potentially the
most vulnerable to foreign cyberthreats. By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   MATHEMATICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ There is no Nobel prize in
metaphysics. But if there were, it would surely go to the thinker
who could solve the stubborn mystery of why mathematics so often
mirrors the workings of the physical world. Rocks arc through the
sky in parabolic trajectories, planets swing in ellipses around the
sun. And inside atoms, tiny particles move according to the
mathematics of quantum mechanics. A look at the work of Nobel
winners Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus Veltman. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ENVIRON-COSTSBENEFITS-REVIEW (Seattle) _ Amid a study of whether
or not to breach four huge hydroelectric dams on the Snake River in
eastern Washington, which would restore 140 miles of it to a wild,
free-flowing condition and could revitalize endangered salmon runs,
government economists are adding a factor known as ``existence
value'' to their list of costs and benefits. Aside from calculating
the proposal's effects on jobs, electric bills and shipping rates,
the government is now hoping to assign a dollar value to Americans'
knowledge that a piece of their wilderness might be regained. By
Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTSWRITING-REVIEW (Undated) _ The 1920s were the golden age
of sportswriting. A handful of talented and ambitious journalists
who found other paths to literary fame blocked began to notice, as
indeed their editors had already noticed, that an increasingly
affluent middle class was responding more to the exploits of Jack
Dempsey, Babe Ruth and Bobby Jones than to what would come to be
known as ``hard'' news stories. Within three decades, TV would make
athletes smaller than life. Rarely again would sportswriters see
athletes in such mythic proportions, outlined against skies
blue-gray or any other color. By Allen Barra. (moved in `a' and `s'
categories)
</P>
<P>
   NOBEL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Nobel Prize awards have often
provoked second-guessing. With the current Nobel season just
wrapping up, it's worth noting the critical reaction to some of the
disputed honorees of the past.
</P>
<P>
   WILT'S-WORDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at some of the
controversial statements made by the late basketball star Wilt
Chamberlain. By Tom Kuntz. (moved in `a' and `s' categories)

</P>
<P>
   U.S.-WORLD-ROLE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The test ban treaty was
only the latest of a number of divisive issues in the capital that
share a common subtext: An argument not over whether the U.S. is
strong, but over how it should use its power. Should it strut the
global beach alone, or leverage that power by accepting restraints
on its freedom to act? It is that debate that has eroded the
``vital center'' that President Clinton talks about so often in his
laments about the disappearance of bipartisanship in foreign
affairs. By David E. Sanger.

mirrors the workings of the physical world. Rocks arc through the
sky in parabolic trajectories, planets swing in ellipses around the
sun. And inside atoms, tiny particles move according to the
mathematics of quantum mechanics. A look at the work of Nobel
winners Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus Veltman. By George Johnson.

   ENVIRON-COSTSBENEFITS-REVIEW (Seattle) _ Amid a study of whether
or not to breach four huge hydroelectric dams on the Snake River in
eastern Washington, which would restore 140 miles of it to a wild,
free-flowing condition and could revitalize endangered salmon runs,
government economists are adding a factor known as ``existence
value'' to their list of costs and benefits. Aside from calculating
the proposal's effects on jobs, electric bills and shipping rates,
the government is now hoping to assign a dollar value to Americans'
knowledge that a piece of their wilderness might be regained. By
Sam Howe Verhovek.

<P>
   SPORTSWRITING-REVIEW (Undated) _ The 1920s were the golden age
of sportswriting. A handful of talented and ambitious journalists
who found other paths to literary fame blocked began to notice, as
indeed their editors had already noticed, that an increasingly
affluent middle class was responding more to the exploits of Jack
Dempsey, Babe Ruth and Bobby Jones than to what would come to be
known as ``hard'' news stories. Within three decades, TV would make
athletes smaller than life. Rarely again would sportswriters see
athletes in such mythic proportions, outlined against skies
blue-gray or any other color. By Allen Barra. (moved in `a' and `s'

   NOBEL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Nobel Prize awards have often

   U.S.-WORLD-ROLE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The test ban treaty was
only the latest of a number of divisive issues in the capital that
share a common subtext: An argument not over whether the U.S. is
strong, but over how it should use its power. Should it strut the
global beach alone, or leverage that power by accepting restraints
on its freedom to act? It is that debate that has eroded the
``vital center'' that President Clinton talks about so often in his
laments about the disappearance of bipartisanship in foreign
affairs. By David E. Sanger.

   A Bird's Eye View, for a Price
</P>
<P>
   Back-yard sunbathers and lovers on the beach have nothing to
fear. The resolution of the world's first private spy camera, now
orbiting 400 miles overhead, is insufficiently sharp to spot
individuals. But it can see much else, including buildings, roads,
pipelines, bridges, tanks, ships, jets and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Space Imaging Inc., the private company in Thornton, Colo., that
built the spacecraft, made public the world's first commercial
image from space whose sharpness rivals those of military spies in
the sky. A closeup of Washington showed the intersection of 14th
and Constitution, cars and buses plainly visible.

   No Pain, Plenty of Gain
</P>
<P>
   Natural childbirth, drug-free in all its pain and glory, may be
losing its cachet. More and more women are saying no to labor pain
and yes to drugs, proffered by doctors with clever new ways of
giving spinal and epidural anesthetics that numb the pelvis but
still let a woman walk around.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of natural childbirth demurred, warning of risks from
the drugs and lamenting the high-tech meddling with a rite of
passage. Some women do still want the full experience of labor and
the satisfaction of getting through it on their own.
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of others scoff at noble suffering. At an
anesthesiology conference in Dallas, doctors reported that from
1981 to 1997 there was a tripling of the percentage of women in
labor at large hospitals who had spinal or epidural injections,
from 22 percent to 66 percent.

   Gore Lands Endorsement Of AFL-CIO
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore won the biggest plum awarded so far in
the presidential campaign: the endorsement of the AFL-CIO. With
Gore slipping in the polls and his rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley,
rising, Gore supporters hoped the labor federation's endorsement
would reverse the vice president's slide.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats hope the endorsement will do more for Gore than
it did for the last Democratic presidential candidate who received
such an early show of support from organized labor: former Vice
President Walter Mondale, who was swamped by President Ronald
Reagan in the 1984 election.

   California Sets Nurse Levels
</P>
<P>
   Managed health care began in California, and now the nation's
toughest health care regulations are springing up there, too. Gov.
Gray Davis signed a bill that will make California the first state
to require fixed staffing ratios of nurses to patients in
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Strongly backed by the state nurses' union _ and opposed by the
hospital industry _ the bill does not set specific ratios, but
leaves it up to the state Department of Health Services to set
staffing levels for various kinds of care.

   Daily Cell Growth in Brain
</P>
<P>
   Biologists at Princeton University have found that the brain
generates a daily stream of new cells that migrate into the
cerebral cortex, the area that harbors higher intellectual
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's too early to tell what the cells are doing, they
could be part of the brain's mechanism for learning. The discovery
was made in monkeys and is expected to prove true of people too. It
caps a series of findings that refute the longstanding view that no
new cells are formed in the adult brain.

   New Clinton Plan for Forests
</P>
<P>
   Ever since President Clinton came to office, he's been at war
with timber companies, paper producers and others who want to
preserve and expand their use of the National Forest System to
harvest timber, dig mines and build roads. In his latest battle,
Clinton announced a plan that would ultimately put 40 million or
more acres of federal forests into a new category that would
prevent roads from being built _ and make them off-limits to
commercial activity.
</P>
<P>
   Western legislators were outraged, particularly because the
White House is using an administrative procedure that bypasses
Congress. But Clinton is betting that Republicans won't want to
take on the forest issue in an election year.

   Suharto Case Is Dropped

   Many Indonesians were angry but few were really surprised. After

amassed fortunes, President Suharto saw his year-long corruption
case dropped for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   This week an electoral assembly will choose a new Indonesian

is not beholden to Suharto will there be any chance of a real
investigation and possible trial.

   A Lean Fighting Machine
</P>
<P>
   After years of resisting change, the Army announced plans to
create lighter, more mobile combat brigades.
</P>
<P>
   With armored vehicles instead of tanks, the brigades would be
more agile than the ``heavy'' armored brigades, able to go anywhere
in 96 hours while still having more punch than light infantry or

   The new brigades are part of a ``major transformation'' planned
by the Army over the next decade, but restructuring efforts have

   Colt's Manufacturing Co. is retreating from its 144-year-old
retail revolver business and will offer only boutique versions of
the Colt .45, the gun that won the West. Colt's, based in West
Hartford, Conn., had been struggling financially even before it and
other gun makers were hit with lawsuits from 28 cities and counties
seeking to recover costs from gun violence.

collectors, and to lay off as many as 200 of its 700 workers.

7.5 percent and afterward at 2.75 percentage points over the
one-year Treasury bill rate.
</P>
<P>
   With the loan from PNC Mortgage, the First Couple no longer
needs the backing of Terry McAuliffe, a Democratic fund-raiser
whose offer of financial help had been criticized by Republicans
who said the arrangement smacked of special treatment.

<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ When Jon S. Corzine began talking about running
for the U.S. Senate from New Jersey early this year, there were at
least 300 million reasons for fellow Democrats to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, 52, was about to retire as chief executive of Goldman
Sachs &AMP; Co. with a $300 million fortune, and he had pledged to
spend as much as necessary to run a campaign to replace Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, a Democrat who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Money alone does not guarantee political success. And recent
political history is full of examples of candidates with more money
than sense of how to use it. But Corzine's journey from political
newcomer to one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination
is a case study in the power of money in politics and what it takes
to use it effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's status as a major political donor helped him win the
guidance of Orin Kramer, a financier and Democratic fund-raiser
from Fort Lee, who advised Corzine about navigating the various
factions of the state's Democratic party and capitalizing on its
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   His fortune has allowed him to assemble a team of experienced
campaign strategists. It has also helped Corzine secure the good
will of some of New Jersey's cash-starved local officials by making
contributions to the campaign to elect Democratic candidates in the
80 Assembly races around the state this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Corzine's money helped dissuade several
formidable candidates _ Democrats and Republicans _ from running
because they were daunted by the prospect of raising $15 million
for the campaign, roughly $30,000 a day from now to Election Day
2000. For instance, the two most prominent Republicans, Gov.
Christie Whitman and former Gov. Thomas Kean, have each cited the
rigors of raising money as a major factor in their decisions not to
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the remarkable things about this race is that
multimillionaires like Governor Whitman and Senator Lautenberg
found it too rich for their blood and left it to the
megamillionaires,'' said Clifford Zukin, a political science
professor at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, he will be judged on the message he delivers,'' he
said. ``But to people who have paid their dues in the political
system with years of service, it might be difficult to see someone
pay it with cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has more than money going for him. With his unassuming
demeanor and rags-to-riches history of rising from clerk to chief
executive, he has convinced many party officials that he can
connect with New Jersey's middle-class voters. He has begun to lay
out a decidedly liberal platform based on the bedrock Democratic
issues of gun control, expanded health care coverage and increased
support for public education.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the candidate who spent the most money won nearly 95
percent of federal elections in 1998, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics, an independent group that tracks campaign
finance issues.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say New Jersey is particularly open to
well-financed political novices. The governor and two U.S. senators
are the only offices elected statewide, so there are no
stepping-stone offices, like lieutenant governor or comptroller, to
allow political rising stars to build name recognition and an
extensive power base.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in several recent national races, and contests in other
states, wealthy businessmen have spent millions underwriting their
own candidacies only to produce costly flops. Two presidential
hopefuls, Ross Perot and Steve Forbes, spent tens of millions of
dollars on their failed candidacies. In California, an airline
executive, Al Checchi, spent $38 million on the 1998 race for
governor and lost in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   So the challenge for Corzine has been to spend not only freely,
but wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's past generosity, including more than $1 million in
donations to Democrats in the past decade, paid dividends even
before most party insiders knew his name. And before deciding to
enter the race, Corzine won the encouragement of Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., national Democratic figures like Robert Strauss
and Vernon Jordan and the tacit backing of New Jersey's other
senator, Robert Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic officeholders in New Jersey, however, who had
received far less financial support from Corzine than their
counterparts in Washington, still viewed him as an outsider.
Corzine was also considered an extremely risky proposition as a
candidate because he had little experience making speeches, holding
news conferences or using television to deliver a message.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer began to bridge that gap by introducing Corzine to state
Sens. John Lynch and Raymond Lesniak, two of the power brokers in
the New Jersey's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I said to him was that he has to shave his
beard,'' Lesniak recalled. ``It's conventional wisdom that voters
subconsciously think a candidate with a beard has something to
hide. But he said, `No, I wouldn't be comfortable.' So immediately
you like the guy. I could see he was down-to-earth, felt passionate
about his beliefs and wanted to be his own person.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine eventually passed the party leaders' ``sniff test,'' and
agreed that the campaign should emphasize his longstanding support
of gun control and increased health care coverage. Then he hit the
state's back roads to try to convince the army of party operatives
and interest groups that he shared many of their political stances
and would champion them in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine met with scores of Democratic county leaders, and
advocates on environmental, civil rights and union issues. They
made a receptive audience because many were searching for an
alternative to former Gov. Jim Florio, whose decision in 1990 to
ram a $2.8 billion tax increase through the Legislature to meet a
court order on school financing helped Republicans win both houses
of the Legislature and the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Corzine signed up three former members of
Lautenberg's staff, including the campaign co-chairmen, Steve
Goldstein and Christy Davis, as the core of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   But an early public speaking fiasco stirred new fears. In
mid-March, Corzine accepted an invitation from the state party
chairman, Tom Giblin, to speak to a group of 250 Essex County
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the prepared remarks were good,'' Corzine said.
``Unfortunately the seven or eight people in the front row who fell
asleep during my speech didn't agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein then flew to Iowa with Corzine for a four-day crash
course in public speaking and mastering television. When Corzine
returned, his speaking style, while hardly rousing, began receiving
better reviews.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Florio was busy trying to lock up the nomination early.
Cashing in on a career's worth of political chits, he won
endorsements from 11 of the state's 21 county leaders, important
victories because New Jersey's county leaders decide which
candidate's name appears under the party banner on election
ballots. A flurry of anonymous ``attack faxes'' also began
surfacing in the offices of reporters and loyal Democrats, pointing
out Corzine's failure to vote in some primaries and occasional
donations to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine responded to the faxes and continued traveling to
diners, union halls and New Jersey Devils' hockey games to woo
party leaders in the state's most populous counties _ Essex,
Middlesex, Bergen, Union and Hudson _ where the bulk of Democratic
primary voters live and who have not committed to Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine also opened his checkbook. He donated more than $25,000
to the fund for Democrats running for the Assembly and pledged to
use his Wall Street connections to raise another $100,000. In
Washington, he has also made $120,000 in contributions to the
Democratic National Committee this year.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By mid-May, the substantial number of officials looking for any
alternative to Florio began to coalesce around Corzine as it became
increasingly apparent that only a candidate who could afford a
massive media campaign could counter Florio's name recognition and
party contacts.
</P>
<P>
   To Curtis Fisher, executive director of New Jersey Public
Interest Group, it is clear that ``you don't even have to spend the
big money for it to work for you. Just having the money tilts the
entire playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yet many Democrats leaning toward Corzine hesitated before
officially announcing their support because of previous party
entanglements. Lesniak, chairman of Union County, and Lynch,
chairman of Middlesex, could not publicly endorse Corzine because
the congressman from their district, Frank Pallone, was still
considering a race.
</P>
<P>
   But in early July, Pallone dropped out of the race, saying he
could not raise enough money to finance a credible campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has since assembled a high-priced collection of campaign
operatives: Susan Estrich, campaign manager of Michael Dukakis'
presidential campaign in 1988; Media &AMP; Message, the New Jersey
consulting firm that ran the gubernatorial campaign of Jim
McGreevey, who lost narrowly to Whitman in 1997; Regina Thomas, a
political consultant who has helped increase voter turnout in
minority neighborhoods for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine also hired two participants in Checchi's failed race for
governor in California, the consultant Robert Shrum and the polling
firm of Penn, Schoen and Berland, who are reported to have warned
Corzine's advisers how to avoid repeating the mistakes of the
Checchi campaign.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Florio and former Democratic state Chairman Tom Byrne, the third
major Democratic contender, have tried to turn Corzine's financial
strength into a political weakness, by calling for voluntary
spending limits. ``I don't think the party's nomination should be
auctioned off to the highest bidder,'' Florio has said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine says that it is unfair for well-known candidates to call
for spending limits and that recent races have made it clear that
money alone cannot win a race. This week he began a $500,000 wave
of radio advertisements intended to raise his name recognition and
rally support for Democratic Assembly candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, this race will be decided based on the ideas I'm
able to articulate, not the money in my pocket or anyone else's
pocket,'' Corzine said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's newfound credibility and deep pockets have convinced
some Republicans to look for a megamillionaire of their own. Faced
with a crowded field of little-known politicians, some Republicans
are trying to recruit Lewis M. Eisenberg, Corzine's former partner
at Goldman Sachs and now executive director of the Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us who've been around for a while know that a little
bit of time and a lot of money can buy name recognition,''
Eisenberg said this week. ``So if I do decide to do this, I will
invest some of my own money and raise enough money to get the job
done.''

<P>
   KENANSVILLE, N.C. _ In the aftermath of Hurricane Floyd, loose
regulations that helped eastern North Carolina become the nation's
biggest producer of turkeys and the second biggest of hogs have
come back to haunt the state's public health and its environment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that the September storm that hit the region
harder than anywhere else, killing 48 people and leaving behind
more than $1 billion in largely inescapable damage, also left a
vast amount of damage that might have been averted: incalculable
and continuing hazards to ground water, wells and rivers from
animal waste, mostly from giant hog farms.
</P>
<P>
   For years, farmers had been free to build hog and poultry
operations as big as they wanted and where ever they liked. They
were allowed to dig huge pits for animal waste, without regard to
the water table or the health and sensibilities of neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In the hurricane, feces and urine soaked the terrain and flowed
into rivers from the overburdened waste pits the industry calls
lagoons. The storm killed more than 2 million turkeys, chickens and
livestock in the region, and waste from the farms is expected to
keep leaching into the water supply until next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a practical problem here,'' Gov. James B. Hunt Jr.
said. Normally by mid-October, Hunt said, farmers would have
reduced the levels of waste in the lagoons, where it evolves
naturally into nutrients that are sprayed on crops.
</P>
<P>
   But the lagoons are brimming with flood-bloated waste, and there
is less use for it now. The growth of crops slows in the fall, and
many fields have been saturated or rendered fallow by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ((On Thursday the State Department of Environment and Natural
Resources announced an ``emergency waste management strategy'' for
hog and poultry farms in an effort to keep waste out of the water
supply. The agency is easing restrictions on the spreading of waste
over fields, but it prohibited reconstruction of severely
hurricane-damaged waste lagoons in the flood plain.
</P>
<P>
   ((In the current soaked condition of the land, some waste
sprayed on the fields will spread. ``We recognize this policy could
contribute to water quality problems through the winter,'' said
Bill Holman, the state's assistant secretary for environmental
protection. ``There are so many swine operations we have a long way
to go.''))
</P>
<P>
   In Duplin County, of which Kenansville is the seat, and across
the rest of North Carolina east of Interstate 95, Hurricane Floyd
has exposed the hazards of one of farming's great innovations of
the 1980s and 1990s and the political liaisons that helped it
develop. That is the practice of industrial farming, or raising
livestock and poultry in close and confined quarters.
</P>
<P>
   It allows farmers to raise thousands of hogs on land where they
could once raise only scores and gives them tight and automated
control over their livestocks' diets, health and growth. The
farmers raise pigs under contract to major hog processors, known in
the business as integrators, like Murphy Family Farms of Duplin
County. The processor supervises the construction of barns,
supplies the pigs and their feed and medicine and hauls them off to
slaughter after the four or five months it takes for them to grow
to 250 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   For eastern North Carolina, this assembly-line production of
hogs and turkeys has come as a savior for tobacco farmers whose
incomes plunged with the decline in smoking. But Hurricane Floyd
has stirred controversy over a means of capturing the wastes of a
hog, which produces four times that of a human.
</P>
<P>
   Human waste in North Carolina and most of the nation must be
captured in public sewers and private septic systems to prevent the
spread of disease. But the state lets the waste of hogs, which
carries many human diseases, be captured by nothing more than a
cesspool. The poultry waste is far less of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The state had few rules for industrial farming until 1993, when
it enacted a law to prohibit livestock farms from intentionally
contaminating the public water supply. Then, two years ago, it put
a moratorium on hog farms.
</P>
<P>
   In Duplin County, 50 miles south of Raleigh, and the home of
42,000 people and 2.2 million hogs, Dr. Hervy Kornegay, a family
physician and chairman of the County Board of Health, said no
disease attributable to the flooding had developed. But as waste
seeps into the private wells that half the homes use for drinking
water, Kornegay said, ``the greatest potential for harm would be
severe gastroenteritis, with diarrhea and vomiting.''
</P>
<P>
   And the seepage is under way. Ronnie Kennedy, county director
for environmental health, said that of 310 private wells he had
tested for contamination since the storm, 9 percent, or three times
the average for eastern North Carolina, had fecal coliform
bacteria. Normally, tests showing any hint of feces in drinking
water, an indication that it can be carrying disease-causing
pathogens, are cause for immediate action.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even before the hurricane there had been flooding and ruptures
of the waste pits that contaminated rivers and killed millions of
fish. And with public fury rising over the acrid, ammonia-laden
odors from the waste lagoons, which carry for more than a mile,
Hunt had begun to call for restraints on an industry that he had
long allowed free rein.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, a Democrat, backs the Legislature's 1997 moratorium on
construction of new and expanded lagoons, which remains in effect
until July 2001. In April, the governor proposed a plan to phase
out the lagoon system over 10 years while engineers devise safer
methods for disposing of the hog waste. He also brought a former
Sierra Club lobbyist, Holman, the environmental protection
official, into his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``My views and most views have evolved to where we have to take
stronger action to clear up our water and rivers,'' Hunt said. ``We
need a strong economy for our people, but we cannot sacrifice the
environment for jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Any legislation to tighten regulations on hog farms meets the
stiff resistance of companies like Murphy Family Farms, the
nation's biggest hog producer.
</P>
<P>
   The industry, whose North Carolina Pork Council vies with
tobacco as the state's mightiest lobby, contends that the lagoon
system held up well in the storm, that the bacteria in wells might
have come not from hogs but from people, factories, flooded water
treatment plants or migrating geese. The council said that only
three of some 4,000 waste lagoons had ruptured
</P>
<P>
   To protect the system, the council sent the state's
congressional delegation in Washington a document, dated Sept. 29
and entitled, ``Draft Legislation for Flood Relief for Farmers in
Eastern North Carolina.'' It seeks $1 billion in grants for farmers
in 41 counties to repair or replace storm-damaged facilities,
including waste lagoons, as they were originally built.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said of the document, ``It's `stunning and it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Anne Mumford, the council's spokeswoman, said the document,
disclosed on Oct. 8 by The News &AMP; Observer of Raleigh, had been
misunderstood. ``Its intent was to be sure assistance wasn't
prohibited,'' Ms. Mumford said. ``We're not illegal operations, so
we shouldn't be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the industry more entrenched, or its political power
stronger, or the hurricane's farm damage greater, than in Duplin
County. With 48 hogs for every one resident, the county has the
densest concentration of hogs in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The rectangular lagoons of reddish-brown waste, many of them
covering more than an acre, dot the flat countryside. Enclosed
within dikes, the lagoons sit behind rows of single-story,
gray-metal structures as large as football fields that house the
hogs. The hog waste flows through slotted boards in the barns to a
cellar, where plastic pipes carry it to a waste lagoon. The lagoons
now and then burp with the bubbles that mark the natural
transformation of feces and urine to the nutrients that farmers
spray over pastures and fields of corn, tobacco, soybeans and rye.
</P>
<P>
   In the hurricane, said Rick Shiver, regional supervisor for the
state Division of Water Quality, many of the lagoons flooded and
the three that ruptured were in Duplin County.
</P>
<P>
   The lagoon at Jesse Lanier's farm, with 1,200 hogs, was breached
when a stream rose and eroded the base of its dike. More than 2
million gallons of the lagoon's waste spilled into Rock Fish Creek,
which feeds the North East Cape Fear River.
</P>
<P>
   At Rabon Maready's farm, Shiver said, 1,000 of 1,600 hogs
drowned in the storm. Both lagoons there flooded and one ruptured
in five spots. Two lagoons at Joey Brinkley's 4,572-hog farm
flooded, and a 12-foot breach opened in one of them. Maready and
Brinkley are contract farmers for Murphy Family Farms of Rose Hill,
on the southern edge of the county.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Murphy, the company's founder and chief executive and a
major contributor to Hunt's campaigns, perfected the current system
of raising hogs for producers. It is the major reason the state's
hog population has grown to more than 9 million from less than 3
million a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was a state senator for 10 years, until 1992, and as a
legislator supported measures curbing counties' power to zone out
hog farms. Murphy would not comment for this article, said his
spokeswoman, Lois Britt.
</P>
<P>
   Britt said the company believed that counties should look within
for solutions to the environmental issues. ``It's easy to look from
outside and say what's wrong,'' she said. She said hog farming
provided jobs and tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hog lagoons,'' she added, ``held up fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, many farmers have mastered the intricate balance of
waste production, lagoon levels and spraying. The Division of Water
Quality said that it had never recorded a complaint against the hog
farm of Tony Jones, 30, of Mount Olive.
</P>
<P>
   Like nearly all hog farmers, Jones works under contract to a
producer. He raises 4,100 pigs in six barns and has two waste
lagoons.
</P>
<P>
   He said he constantly tests the lagoon waste. ``If it needs lime
to keep the odor down,'' he said, ``I add lime. If it needs
pumping, I pump on days that are optimum for pumping.''
</P>
<P>
   But other farms stir frequent complaints. Becky and Danny
Lancaster, who operate a rural welding supply business, live within
a mile of three farms they call offensive. Mrs. Lancaster, the
mother of two teen-agers, said: ``You don't plan birthday parties
outside. You no longer plan things. You plan around the odors and
flies.''
</P>
<P>
   She keeps a log of odors that waft her way. In September, she
made entries on six days. ``Nasty, musty, stifling odor in the
air,'' she wrote on Sept. 9, a humid and rainy day. ``Difficult to
breathe. Feel like suffocating. Like an old outhouse.'' On Sept.
23, she wrote, ``Smell of urine strong in air.''
</P>
<P>
   She produced another log she used to keep of the flies she
swatted in her office. She said that on May 22, 1996, ``I killed
1,192. The next day I killed 1,100. The next day it was 1,140.''
She added that flies appear in January, too.
</P>
<P>
   For years, said H.C. Powers, a 77-year-old retired school
principal and current chairman of the six-member Duplin County
Board of Commissioners, residents have been complaining of odors
and flies. But three board members always support the industry, so
attempts by Powers and two others to regulate the farms die in 3-3
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people here say more pollution control would only
imperil more farmers, who are already struggling. Pork prices have
been plunging for more than a year, so much so that Murphy has
agreed to sell out, for $450 million, to Smithfield Farms Inc. of
Virginia, the nation's leading slaughterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The county manager, James W. Barnhardt Jr., said farms in the
county that had $620 million in revenue two years ago are expected
to receive $170 million less this year. ``We are trying to
diversify,'' Barnhardt said. ``On the other hand, Duplin County is
a rural agricultural county. That's what we do.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the starting whistle, sisterhood's child springs out of the
pack on pitter-pat feet that barely crush grass. She takes the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slow down,'' bellows her Radford University coach, Pat
Connolly, running barefoot across the course, stop-watch in hand.
``Slowitdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Khadijah Conda smiles as she lets the other college
cross-country runners engulf her. Coach was thinking about her
after all. Maybe she hadn't made a mistake coming to this obscure
southwestern Virginia town with no mall. Maybe it's going to be all
right. Connolly had recruited her out of Purdue with promises to
lie awake nights worrying about her technique and her muscle fibers
and her path to the 2000 Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The young woman doesn't know the half of it. The 56-year-old
coach huffing up stadium steps to watch the runners' progress has a
covenant to keep. This is more than a plan to prepare a 21-year-old
sprinter for the Olympics. It's also about a 39-year friendship
between two self-described wild women who forced their way into the
arena, struggled to keep their place and now want a new generation
to carry their torches.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for Khadijah is simple enough: Connolly entered her in
this 3.1-mile run two weeks ago, Khadijah's first race at Radford,
to build up stamina and strength, not to score points; too much
early speed could bring injury and a loss of confidence in her
training. Khadijah has to know she can run through pain and go the
distance before she concentrates on the details of the sprints.
</P>
<P>
   But there was much more at stake. Connolly also feels
responsible to Willye B. White, her oldest friend, who spotted
Khadijah when she was a Chicago schoolgirl, became her mentor and
sent her to Connolly to become a champion. It is as if Pat Connolly
and Willye White are sharing a child, the offspring of their
passion for sport.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly and White have considered themselves sisters since
1960, when they were teammates at the Rome Olympics. Through
births, deaths, lovers, children, four husbands _ and the athletic
tidal shifts brought about by the Cold War, television, drugs,
professionalization, the shoe wars and the women's movement _ they
have been confidantes and conspirators, life-supports in ways
unique to women of their time.
</P>
<P>
   The women of their time are the builders of the current boom in
women's sports. On Monday night, the Women's Sports Foundation, an
important institution of that boom, will hold its 25th anniversary
gala in New York. Willye White will be there, while Pat Connolly
will try to leave her teams for a night. Willye and Pat are what
such dinners are about.
</P>
<P>
   White competed in five Olympics, winning two silver medals.
Connolly competed in three Games but found her calling as a coach;
her most famous athlete was Evelyn Ashford, winner of three Olympic
gold medals and the former world-record holder in the women's 100
meters.
</P>
<P>
   Could Khadijah be another Evelyn? Does she have the skill and
the hunger to be world class? If she is truly their child, she will
do more than run with controlled fire and give herself to the
Olympian dream. She will measure her life, as they have for almost
a half-century, in Olympiads, four years crowned by the Games.
</P>
<P>
   To Melbourne, 1956
</P>
<P>
   Willye White was a green-eyed redhead raised by her grandfather
to escape ``the ignorant stick'' _ the chopping hoe _ of the cotton
fields. She discovered the long jump at 16. She would leap to
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to get me out of Mississippi before something
happened to me,'' she said this month of the grandfather she calls
her father. ``I'm not a nonviolent person.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father would not allow contact with white people _ he
didn't like or trust them. And I was not poor, like some of the
other girls who were totally dependent on their college coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   White trained at predominantly black Tennessee State, then the
pre-eminent women's track-and-field school, under coach Ed Temple.
They had conflicts over her attitude, her independence. But she
came home from Australia with more than a silver medal in the long
jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw black and white athletes living as one family,'' she
said. ``The Olympic village was unity. The only place in the world
where there was peace. It was home.''
</P>
<P>
   To Rome, 1960
</P>
<P>
   ``I was your classic child-abuse kid,'' Connolly said recently,
``incredibly insecure, full of hell, needing attention.''
</P>
<P>
   For Billee Patricia Daniels (her original name), track and field
was the way out of a family, the way to distance herself from a
community and a Mormon official who refused to protect her from her
stepfather. She ran away from home but was returned.
</P>
<P>
   The family moved to California, where a high school driver's
education teacher noticed her long legs _ at 11 she had danced with
a ballet _ and urged her to come out for his Amateur Athletic Union
team. In her first meet, she broke a long-jump record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the long jump,'' she recalls. ``It was like a grand
jete leap and I didn't have to hold my hands over my head. I won
the next meet, and then all I could think about was that the
Olympics could get me out of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   She also ran the 800 meters. ``I went to the front and didn't
let anyone pass me. I coughed blood at the end of every race.''
</P>
<P>
   She made the Olympic team as a runner, but envied the red-headed
black woman who owned the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I was, 17 years old, never knew a black person, actually
thought they might have horns. What an education for me. When we
trained in Emporia, Kansas, I could go to the local movie house,
but they couldn't. And you know what was playing? `The King and I.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, for a party, I painted my face brown with charcoal and
wore a leopard skin. It was a Tarzan thing. I couldn't understand
why some of them were upset. But Willye took me aside and
explained. I was such a baby in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then we got to Rome, and I met John Thomas, the
world-record high jumper, at the Olympic village cafeteria. He was
6-6 and so handsome. He was 19. He was the first boy who ever
kissed me. Willye had to peel me off the ceiling. It was love at
first sight. If my parents had ever known I kissed a black man,
they would have taken me right home. They were so angry that I was
rooming with a Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, White, by now a nursing student at Chicago
State, was the perfect roommate for the innocent hellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw myself in this big, ox-y white girl who never wore
makeup,'' said White, who was always svelte and glamorous. ``Wild.
Vulnerable. A need to be embraced. Blacks were the ones who
embraced her. Before money came on board, all we had was each
other. Women had to stick together, mother and protect each other.
That was part of our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Pat's parents made such a fuss, White was moved to
another room, and as soon as White finished competing, she was
shipped home, accused of drinking with sportswriters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't true,'' White said. ``I was headstrong. They needed
to break me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat was threatened with expulsion by American officials if she
didn't stop seeing John. They stopped holding hands in the
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To Tokyo, 1964
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a hero back home,'' Pat said. ``Suddenly, everybody
wanted to be my friend. It was horrible, phoney. But I stood up to
my parents for the first time. And I worked out hard because I
wanted to make the '61 national team and go to Russia with John and
Willye.''
</P>
<P>
   She made the team and lowered the American 800 record to two
minutes 13 seconds after a night of vodka drinking. Willye and John
taught her to twist. She lost her virginity.
</P>
<P>
   She flunked out of Brigham Young University in three semesters.
Just about her only friends were the three black students on
campus. She was already on probation for ``lewd'' dancing; she was
teaching Mormons to twist.
</P>
<P>
   Both Willye and Pat married handsome men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claude Taliaferro was beautiful,'' White said. ``We met at
Tennessee State, got married in 1961, and I left him in 1964. I
loved him, but he wanted children. I never wanted a child. I was
selfish, so much I wanted to see and do. I don't know why people
want children. It's the closest you come to death without getting
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly wanted a child to prove her adulthood, her femaleness.
After John Thomas broke her heart, she secretly married a blond
beach body, Jim Winslow, in Reno in 1963. They were both 19. They
lived in his car for a few weeks until he put her on the plane to
the nationals, where she high-jumped 5 feet 7 inches and began
competing in the pentathlon, which she won.
</P>
<P>
   At the Games, she placed seventh and extended her world view:
``We were supposed to hate those dirty Russians, but they were so
nice, such fun, and they could really dance.''
</P>
<P>
   White won a silver medal in the 400-meter relay, but her
revelation was darker. The UCLA crowd, as she called them, was
introducing performance-enhancing drugs to track and field,
especially steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had so much medical knowledge,'' she said, ``they could
have cured cancer if there had been money in it.''
</P>
<P>
   To Mexico City 1968
</P>
<P>
   On April 4, 1966, Bradley Baker Winslow was born to Pat. She
loved being a mother, breast-fed the baby between training
sessions, felt guilty and torn all the time. In 1967, she finally
beat Willye to become the American long-jump champion. ``Was I
happy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For a while. Both women agree that while blood and sweat get you
to the Games, winning medals is also about weather, officials,
luck. Both women had bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   During a massage in Mexico City, a lamp fell on White's leg,
causing first-degree burns and raising fist-sized blisters.
</P>
<P>
   During the pentathlon hurdles, the woman in the next lane
slugged Pat in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Pat flew home after three days. Bradley was sick. Winslow was
not around. That would be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   To Munich, 1972
</P>
<P>
   A single mother, Connolly was working as a $150-a-month
attendant in a health club when she met and married Dick Bank, who
had once had a dalliance with Willye White. Bank had been the
Adidas representative at Mexico City, a shoe warrior in the days
when athletes found $100 bills under their insoles.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly successfully defended her pentathlon title at the 1970
Tahoe nationals, but she was convinced she could no longer ``go
clean'' and win. The stream of drugs that White had spotted was now
a river running through track and field.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly did not want to do drugs. She quit competing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, she began coaching women at Beverly Hills High School
and realized that she ``was so much better as a coach than as an
athlete.'' It was in her nature, she thought, to want to be a
mother. Later that year she also started the first women's team at
UCLA. Her $300 budget for the season included her salary, uniforms
and travel expenses. Six women came out.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly did not get to Munich, Germany, but White saw the
terrorists from her dormitory room overlooking the parking lot in
the village.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most devastating experience of my entire life,''
she said. ``The massacre of the Israelis split the family, violated
the sanctuary. It was the end of a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But that year was also the beginning of a good thing: Title IX,
the federal legislation that would give the women's movement a ramp
to the arena.
</P>
<P>
   To Montreal, 1976
</P>
<P>
   Two of Connolly's UCLA athletes, Ashford and the javelin thrower
Karin Smith, qualified for the team. During the trials, Connolly
could not take her eyes off White, bidding for a sixth Olympic
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a fleeting feeling of jealousy, I should be out there,
too,'' Connolly said. ``But then the real me came out. I wanted to
coach Willye, stretch her out, ice her down. People weren't doing
that then. I wanted to change her technique. She wasn't hitting the
board well. But I wasn't an established coach, I couldn't just go
up to her.''
</P>
<P>
   White laughs at that. ``She was still my child then. But I could
have used her help. My father had died, I pulled a hamstring. I
made the team, but because I was hurt, I didn't go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered taking drugs then, but I was a nurse, I read the
five pages of contra-indications. They weren't offering millions in
those days, just victory. If I had come along later, I would have
done it.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, she was a vested employee of the city of Chicago. She
also coached girls at Chicago State and at a successful club, the
Metropolitan Striders. She loved coaching, but there was no money
in it.
</P>
<P>
   To Moscow, 1980
</P>
<P>
   Connolly's UCLA team won the 1977 national championship, but
there was no time to celebrate; there was too much laundry to do.
And soon there was no time for the team, either.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, she had six kids. She had divorced Bank and
married Harold Connolly, the gold-medal hammer-thrower and father
of four. She had Bradley; together they had Adam. She was the
primary caregiver. Harold held down two teaching jobs, and
continued to lift weights and throw.
</P>
<P>
   They also argued about drugs. He had used them and felt they
were more important than ever for an Olympic hopeful, especially a
fragile, injury-prone one such as Ashford, whom Pat was training
privately. She refused to let Ashford use drugs.
</P>
<P>
   As she always did, she called Willye White for support. Through
the years, especially when they were physically apart, White
encouraged Connolly to let the laundry slide and to hang tough with
Harold about drugs.
</P>
<P>
   That argument was deferred. President Jimmy Carter boycotted the
1980 Games in retaliation for the Soviet Union's invasion of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   To Los Angeles, 1984
</P>
<P>
   Connolly had screamed, cajoled, stroked and played mind games to
keep Ashford on track. It was practically a labor of love until
Puma began sponsoring her. In her best year, Connolly made about
$30,000 from Ashford.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1991 book, ``Coaching Evelyn,'' Connolly recalls the
moment after the fans and the reporters had gone, when she and
Ashford were alone, touching the 100-meter gold medal: ``We clung
to each other, somehow knowing it was our last shared moment of
love, respect and pure joy. Now other people had plans for
Evelyn.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To Seoul, 1988
</P>
<P>
   Connolly watched the Olympics on television, wishing she were
still coaching Ashford. She is still not comfortable talking about
their breakup. The relationship between coach and athlete can be
more intense than a love affair, and vulnerable to the jealousies
of husbands, wives and lovers.
</P>
<P>
   She likes to talk about what she would have done for Ashford.
She would have made her practice more starts, lift more weights.
Most important, she would have pressured the system to test the
competition for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ashford won a relay gold medal, but it was the era of the late
Florence Griffith-Joyner. Connolly has always been convinced that
FloJo had the same feelings about drugs as did Harold.
</P>
<P>
   To Barcelona, 1992
</P>
<P>
   Willye and Pat chattered on the phone watching Michael Jordan
and the Dream Team on television. Forget about Americans vs.
Russians; now it is Nike vs. Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   The amateur ideal? Right. Do you remember when ``global
village'' meant falling in love with people from another country in
the next dorm? And drugs. Don't you wish TV would show
before-and-after pictures of the women whose bodies change so
dramatically between Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   But there were good things, too. Like sex tests. How many times
were we beaten by men?
</P>
<P>
   And the girls. There are girls on this team born after Title IX,
taking their right to compete for granted.
</P>
<P>
   White said at the time that she was determined to find a way to
get back to coaching girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the diamonds in the rough,'' she cried, ``the
precious creatures who will rule the world. Men can dominate, but
they can't incubate!''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said she would love to coach women, in a college
setting. But she and Harold now had seven children between them.
There was a ton of laundry. White encouraged her to finish college
and start thinking about herself for a change. ``The rehearsal is
over, darling, the performance has begun.''
</P>
<P>
   To Atlanta, 1996
</P>
<P>
   Armed with her degree and some writing assignments, Connolly
went to the Games and hung out with White and her guest,
17-year-old Khadijah Conda: a high school all-American, a state
champion in the 400, which she ran in 55 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the kind of athlete coaches wanted me to be,'' White
said. ``A naive, starry, dependent child, no street smarts. She
lost her plane tickets and her event tickets. I would have died
with her in a foreign country. But I think it was a learning
experience. She knew she had to grow up, become independent, take
care of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Khadijah learned other lessons on that trip: ``Being with Mrs.
White and meeting coach Connolly at the Games was an amazing
experience. They had such pure love for track and field, such
passion. I wondered if anything could ever mean so much to me.''
</P>
<P>
   To Sydney, 2000
</P>
<P>
   White retired from her city job reluctantly. The buyout was too
good. She had to leave a job she loved, setting up sports programs
for girls in housing projects. Changing their behavior, giving them
hope.
</P>
<P>
   She kept busy being chairwoman of the women's sports committee
of the U.S. Olympic Committee as well as a special task force to
identify and encourage volunteers. And giving advice to Khadijah.
</P>
<P>
   At Purdue, Khadijah lowered her time in the 400 meters to 52
seconds, but she did not fulfill her promise. The record is almost
four seconds lower. She wondered if it was the death of her father,
a lack of mental toughness or impersonal coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would call Mrs. White,'' recalled Khadijah, who uses the
honorific to be respectful. ``She would say, `Arm pump governs leg
speed.' Just that, but it opened up a world to me. Sometimes very
philosophical, like, `To be stuck in old ways is slow death to a
person.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And sometimes it was very direct and dynamic. Once she said,
`You are a champion, Khadijah, but you need more coaching.'''
</P>
<P>
   And she had a coach for her.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly's laundry pile had finally shrunk. Of her own three
children, only Shannon, now 21, was still in college. Harold was
retired from teaching. White urged Connolly to stop giving herself
obstacles, to take care of herself. Connolly began applying for
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   After hundreds of rejections _ more accurately, no responses to
her applications _ Connolly answered an ad in the NCAA News for a
women's track-and-field coach at Radford, less than an hour south
of Roanoke. Once a state teachers college for women, Radford was a
co-ed, Division I public university of 8,500 students, mostly from
surrounding Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the job,'' White said. ``This is your time.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, Connolly was appointed director of men's and
women's track and field and cross-country, and was overseeing the
construction of a new running track and a new field house. But
building the program would be harder. She needed a star, a Big
South Conference champion who could grab for the Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   That's when White called and reminded her about that smart,
starry, adorable child who drove them crazy in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Radford, Va., 1999
</P>
<P>
   Face contorted and glistening with sweat, Khadijah Conda
struggles over the tree-shaded dirt path along the New River. Other
cross-country runners pass Khadijah, chattering blithely, and she
thinks: What am I doing here?
</P>
<P>
   Connolly senses the question and barrels up, clicking her watch.
``Smile!'' she yells. ``Smile! Never let them know you're
hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   It's what she screamed at Evelyn.
</P>
<P>
   All Connolly wants right now is for Khadijah to learn that she
can run through pain and finish a hard job. In December, when the
indoor track season begins, so will the fun. She will unleash
Khadijah on the conference, win the 100, 200 and 400 meters, giving
Radford instant credibility.
</P>
<P>
   And then Connolly will point her toward Australia, where it all
started for Willye White. But first the young woman has to go the
distance. And then they have to think about taping her ankles every
day, maybe changing her shoes. Should she lift weights? Practice
more starts?
</P>
<P>
   Khadijah staggers in more than five minutes behind the winner.
She is hurting and sobbing. Her calves are numb, she has needles
and pins in her feet. She let coach and Mrs. White down. Who needs
this?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so great,'' cries Connolly, pulling off Khadijah's
shoes and kneading her feet. ``Your time was under 25 minutes, you
finished your first cross-country run and you are sore and numb.
This is perfect. It proves you have mostly fast-twitch muscles.
Long distance is wrong for you because you're a natural sprinter.
Pure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Evelyn.''

MUSLIM FIGHTER EMBRACES WARRIOR MYSTIQUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia _ Among the ranks of fierce-looking Chechen
fighters, with their grenades and spare magazines strapped to their
chests, there is a man who stands out as especially fearsome. His
black hair snakes to his shoulders, he goes by the single name of
Khattab, and even among Chechens _ let alone his Russian foes _ he
is both hated and revered.
</P>
<P>
   Khattab is an Arab, a self-declared Islamic warrior, who has
come to Chechnya to fight the Russians he first battled in
Afghanistan after the Soviet army occupation in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Accused of leading incursions into Chechnya's neighboring
Russian republic, Dagestan, and of being behind apartment bombings
that killed 300 in Russia, he has come to symbolize for the
Kremlin, and for some in the West, their worst fears about Islamic
extremism and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian authorities put out a warrant for his arrest with
Interpol after the August incursions into Dagestan and the
September bombings. Although they have produced little evidence to
back the charge, they have also linked his name with that of Osama
bin Laden, the Arab commander based in Afghanistan who is accused
by the United States of masterminding the bombings of U.S.
Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last year.
</P>
<P>
   Khattab denies any connections with the explosions in Russia.
But he never misses an opportunity to pledge to fight Russia, and
to help Muslims in the republics of the North Caucasus _ including
Chechnya, where there is strong sentiment for independence, and
Dagestan, where it is much weaker _ to separate from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview in the Chechen capital, Grozny, Khattab said
his only aim was to help free his fellow Muslims from Russian rule.
Since his arrival in the Caucasus in 1995, he has trained scores of
young fighters in guerrilla warfare, particularly in the art of
mountain ambushes.
</P>
<P>
   During Russia's 1994-96 war against Chechens seeking
independence, his units were widely credited with conducting two
ambushes on Russian columns that killed as many as 100 soldiers
each.
</P>
<P>
   After that war ended in an uneasy truce in 1996, with Chechnya's
status left in limbo until 2001, Khattab did not abandon the
battlefield. Last year he led an attack on a Russian brigade based
in Dagestan, which had been accused of committing atrocities
against Chechens during the 1994-96 war.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Khattab linked up with the Chechen rebel commander
Shamil Basayev for more strikes into Dagestan, provoking Russia
first into bombing what it said were guerrilla bases in Chechnya,
and then into sending its forces in.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chechens are now criticizing Khattab and Basayev for
bringing war again, but others revere him as a warrior who has been
wounded three times fighting with them. He is tolerated by the
Chechen leader, Aslan Maskhadov, for his part in the war, but also
probably because he refuses to leave. ``He is a good fighter, but
not such a good commander,'' said a Chechen commander, Aslanbek
Izmailov.
</P>
<P>
   Khattab is thought to come from a wealthy Bedouin family in
Saudi Arabia but when interviewed would not give his full name,
nationality or place of birth. He said only that he was 30 and that
his mother's family came originally from the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of wars in Afghanistan and Tajikistan as well as
Chechnya, he revealed a passionate hatred for the Russian armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not say that American democracy is any better, but the
Russian army was terrible. In Afghanistan what they called the
enemy was the entire people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he first went to Afghanistan in 1987, at 18, spurred by
the sight of millions of refugees. ``I wanted to be a surgeon,'' he
said, ``but then I took part in a couple of operations and decided
to be a mujahed.'' He used the Arabic for ``holy warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   After Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan, he went to
Tajikistan and fought for two years with the Islamic opposition
there against Russian-backed government forces. In 1995 he heard
about the war in Chechnya and went to take a look.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I opened the map and saw how small it was, I thought
there would only be 1,000 men there fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it seems there were a lot of wolves living here,'' he said
with a laugh.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He wears the Chechen emblem of a wolf on the front of his dark
blue beret, has been accepted as a son by Basayev's family and has
married a woman from Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   A slight figure dressed in camouflage fatigues with Arabic
script emblazoned on his lapels, he is known to be a strict Muslim.
He drives a black Land Cruiser. Ordinary Chechens approach him for
help with money or to try to win the release of captured relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Khattab says that he knows bin Laden from Afghanistan, when they
both fought in a big offensive in northern Afghanistan, but that he
has no contact with him now.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he seems to share something of bin Laden's world view. In
the interview he attacked the United States for its bombing war
against Iraq, asking why it did not assassinate Saddam Hussein
rather than make civilians suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about past attacks on the U.S. military in Saudi Arabia,
he said: ``There is no difference between the American Army and the
Russian army. They seized our territory, and Muslims have the right
to seek such a solution.''

PEACEKEEPERS IN EAST TIMOR KILL 3 GUNMEN IN A FIREFIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia)  (js) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In the sharpest clash of their three-week
deployment in East Timor, Australian troops reported Saturday that
they were ambushed and pinned down by armed men and that they
killed three of their attackers before being rescued by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The firefight was a sign of increasing conflicts in the remote
territory as the Indonesian national assembly prepares to vote on
whether to accept East Timor's decision six weeks ago to break away
and become an independent nation.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in the assembly is defiant, defensive and sentimental
about the loss of the former Portuguese colony, which Indonesia
invaded in 1975 and annexed as its 27th province. But most analysts
here say that when the vote is taken, probably early this week, the
assembly will accept the fait accompli of East Timor's
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they going to do, send more troops to the island? I
think that's impossible,'' said Goenawan Mohamad, a leading editor
and political commentator. One other possibility is that the
legislature could delay a vote in an effort to save face.
</P>
<P>
   Goenawan said that for 24 years, Indonesians had been
``brainwashed'' about East Timor and that it is easy for
politicians to rouse a nationalist backlash on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many Indonesians are confused about the situation and the
reasons for an armed international presence there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk about East Timor, I am so proud as an
Indonesian,'' said Dewi Hartono, a receptionist. ``Indonesia is a
big nation but we are not arrogant, like Australia. They say they
come to solve a problem, so why do they create more problems? Why
are they shooting?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, East Timor is a relatively small issue for the
assembly, which is preparing to elect Indonesia's next president on
Wednesday, said a former Cabinet minister, Sarwono Kusumaatmadja.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not angry about the separation itself and I don't
think any political party intends to prolong the issue,'' he said.
``But the issue is being used now to attack Habibie.''
</P>
<P>
   President B.J. Habibie, who is campaigning within the assembly
to be elected to a full five-year term in office, made a surprise
unilateral offer of independence to East Timor early this year,
ignoring warnings made even by pro-independence leaders that more
time was needed to calm the situation.
</P>
<P>
   When the people of East Timor voted by nearly 90 percent on Aug.
30 to break from Indonesia, armed militias created and supported by
the Indonesian military rampaged though the territory, driving much
of the population from their homes and leveling almost all cities
and towns.
</P>
<P>
   This led to the creation of a multinational peacekeeping force,
dominated by Australian troops, which entered East Timor on Sept.
21. Since then, the area has been mostly pacified, allowing aid to
reach a growing number of displaced people.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past week, peacekeeping patrols in the western part
of the territory have clashed several times with small militia
groups.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Saturday's hour-long firefight, an Australian officer said,
three militia members were wounded in addition to those killed, but
no Australians were hurt. The officer, Col. Mark Kelly, said the
engagement took place 10 miles from the border with West Timor,
which is part of Indonesia and is now a staging ground for the
militias.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the tactics they're employing show a level of
training, a level of aggression,'' he said from Dili, East Timor's
capital, suggesting that the Indonesian military was involved.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, the military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Sudrajat, said the
encounter was still being investigated. But he denied that the
Indonesian military was responsible for militia activities. ``That
accusation isn't true at all,'' he said. ``The Indonesian military
is in no position to set up a militia. The peacekeepers are only
accusing us to find a scapegoat.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the evidence in East Timor is overwhelming that the
Indonesian military created, armed and often directed the militias,
much of that information _ like other information about East Timor
_ has not reached the people of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate in the national legislature is almost meaningless
because it is completely fueled and informed by this wild
disinformation that is going on about East Timor,'' said Brent
Preston, co-director of the East Timor office of the Atlanta-based
Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption, democratization, reform _ these are reported very
freely in the press,'' he said. ``But with the East Timor issue, it
is the government line over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   According to this line, East Timor has been ripped from
Indonesia as part of an international conspiracy to pull the nation
apart. ``The members of the national legislature should know that
this is ridiculous,'' Preston said, ``but you hear them saying it
over and over.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hollywood has always been fond of prostitutes, but
the fall TV season is chockablock with ladies of the night.
</P>
<P>
   On Fox's ``Action,'' the hilariously obnoxious producer Peter
Dragon (Jay Mohr) offers a job to a hooker named Wendy Ward (the
very cool Illeana Douglas). ``I want you to work for me as a motion
picture executive, which is just a different kind of prostitute,''
he tells her.
</P>
<P>
   When her procurer, Rene, shows up at the studio with a gun,
Dragon asks what his favorite movie is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was most affected by the elegant impressionism of Francois
Truffaut's `Day for Night,''' replies the pimp, who then becomes an
investor in Dragonfire Films.
</P>
<P>
   Moral: Flesh peddling is flesh peddling, on the street or in the
suite.
</P>
<P>
   In NBC's ``West Wing,'' a White House speechwriter, played by
Rob Lowe, spends the night with a woman he meets at a restaurant
and then realizes _ when they accidentally switch beepers _ that
she is a call girl with Cashmere Escorts. She spunkily defends
herself: ``In my life, I have never committed a federal crime,
which is more than I can say for some people in your line of work.
I don't need saving. ... I like what I do and it is putting me
through law school.''
</P>
<P>
   Prostitution was more than a metaphor for politics in '96, when
Dick Morris, the pollster who poured so much money into early TV
ads that Bill Clinton had to sell the Lincoln Bedroom, got caught
with a call girl.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion this fall of selling favors is hot on TV. And it is
reaching new heights in Washington with the astonishing cascade of
money into politics.
</P>
<P>
   Once members of Congress were respected gentlemen of the Club.
Now they are more like ladies of ill repute, with Mitch McConnell
serving as the hard-boiled madam of this Capitol Hill bawdy house.
</P>
<P>
   In a searing tableau, Senate Republicans turned on one of their
own last week, stoning John McCain for two days. His offense?
Daring to suggest that the obscene amounts of money pouring into
his colleagues' coffers are corrupting.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. McCain, the champion of campaign finance reform legislation
being debated last week, was still recovering when he came to The
Times for an interview on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ain't quittin','' he said. ``The exercise we went through,
I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't very pleasant, to say the least. But
I've faced a lot tougher things in my life than Mitch McConnell's
temper tantrums.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator, who is trying to get the presidential
nomination of the party stomping on him, called it a ``let's see if
we can't wreck McCain'' effort. Asked what motivates his nemesis,
he smiled: ``For as long as I live, I will never know.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell demanded on the Senate floor that McCain cite specific
examples of how soft money has warped the Senate. ``How can there
be corruption if no one is corrupt?'' the Kentucky senator asked,
in an Orwellian construction, challenging McCain to name names of
colleagues who had traded legislative favors for money. In a body
that has established elaborate rituals to avoid personal attacks,
it suddenly seemed like a raw-knuckled scene out of ``Fight Club.''
</P>
<P>
   By trying to force Sen. McCain to whittle down the problem to
individual quid pro quos, Madam Mitch hoped to obscure the fact
that the whole joint is for sale. It is hard to think of a member
of Congress of either party _ in this era of soft money, hard
money, easy money, Chinese money, Hollywood money, Internet money,
telecommunications money and trial lawyers' money _ who has not
rewarded a contributor by giving increased access or paying more
attention to legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether $5,000 is, or $6,000, or $10,000, or
$100,000, or $1 million ... at a certain point any money becomes
corruptible,'' mused McCain, who promised to stick to his $1,000
donation limit even if he gets the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   To know that lawmakers' love is for sale, just look at how Big
Tobacco poured money into the Republican Party and won a
GOP-orchestrated reprieve from tighter regulation or how the NRA's
contributions have bought it weaker gun laws or how Big Oil greased
the skids for a break on royalty payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're gridlocked by special interests who control us with
their big money,'' Sen. McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if we've established what the game is, are we
just haggling over the price?

COMMENTARY: DON'T LET PROFITS GET IN THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Italicize 1st sentence of article.) 
(js) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is this a story we will read sometime in the next year?
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (NYT) _ The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1,266
points today after Amazon.com announced that it had inadvertently
made a profit.
</P>
<P>
   After years of having persuaded investors that its business
model called for it to consistently lose money until it had built
up its market share, Amazon stunned Wall Street by announcing
earnings of 1 cent per share this quarter on sales of $1.1
trillion, or 10 percent of U.S. GDP.
</P>
<P>
   The reason these earnings rattled Wall Street was that investors
began to realize that no matter how big Amazon's market share
became, its profit margins were going to remain razor thin because
it is now competing with everyone _ not just booksellers. And
therefore its market capitalization _ the company is valued at more
than Fort Knox _ was simply not sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pie in the sky is always great as long as the pie remains in
the sky,'' said one Wall Street broker, ``but when the pie actually
comes down to earth and you get to see what a real slice looks like
_ well, you have a problem. Amazon's whole strategy was to keep the
pie in the sky. But now they've blown it by accidentally making a
profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based Internet retailer issued a statement following
its quarterly earnings report, saying: ``The Amazon board wants to
apologize to shareholders for completely missing its quarterly loss
target and inadvertently making a profit. The board has been
assured by management that this problem will be rectified in the
coming quarter. Amazon intends to increase both its advertising
budget and the number of books it will sell at a loss to insure
that it returns to unprofitability by the next quarter. Our
shareholders can rest assured that our primary goal remains market
share and our business motto remains: `Amazon.com: We took the `E'
out of P/E.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Said one Wall Street Internet analyst: ``Look, I believe the
Internet changes everything. I've taken the Kool-Aid. But I think
the question of whether Jeff Bezos (Amazon's founder) will ever
make the massive profits that his stock price implies is really
uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   It will depend on at least three things, the analyst said. The
first is, Are Amazon's competitors dead or are they just behind?
Has Bezos killed Wal-Mart, Barnes &AMP; Noble, Best Buy, Borders, Toys
``R'' Us and Circuit City _ all of which he is now competing
against? Or, has he just showed them the power of the Internet as a
retailing tool and all these brick-and-mortar companies will now
become clicks and bricks?
</P>
<P>
   ``If that is the case,'' the analyst said, ``all Amazon will
have done is to build market share for the day when its rivals
catch up. If it hasn't made money up to now, with its huge head
start on the Internet, how is it going to make big money when the
others catch up? The cost of switching from Amazon to another
retailer is zero on the Internet. It's just one click. Wal-Mart
hasn't even come into cyberspace in any serious way yet _ and those
guys are meaner than junk-yard dogs. You think they're going to let
Amazon just put them out of business? No way.''
</P>
<P>
   The second thing Amazon's future depends on, said this analyst,
is what inning we are in. If we are still in the first inning as
far as Internet retailing is concerned, maybe Amazon, or another
Amazon soon to be born, will come up with yet another innovation
for using the Internet to sell things at a profit. But if we are
already in, say, the fifth inning, if the basic Internet revolution
in retailing is now in place and the rest is just execution, then
the Wal-Marts will eventually learn to execute. Amazon might still
be a winner _ it is a phenomenal marketer _ but not a
winner-take-all.
</P>
<P>
   The third unknown, the analyst said, is whether Amazon can use
its high stock price to buy one or more already profitable
brick-and-mortar retailer in order to go head to head with
Wal-Mart. At first people thought all business was moving to the
Net; now they see that the Net is moving into business. The next
big merger wave will be between virtual companies and real ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear, I thought Bezos' actual plan was to skip making a
profit and go directly from being an IPO to being an NGO for
distributing books cheaply,'' said another analyst. ``I don't know
what Amazon's future is as a company _ but as a charity, wow! What
a write-off machine! It could have been called `Unicef.com.'
Really, who's given away more kids' books at cost than Amazon?
Bezos had a chance to be Andrew Carnegie _ without ever making a
dime. Now he's blown it by making a profit and forcing everyone to
look at Amazon like, well, a real company. I mean, who needs
that?''

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ No one ever said that this city's vaunted
brotherly love had to extend to the nip-and-tuck mayoral contest
that is winding down toward the distinct possibility, according to
opinion polls, of the first Republican mayor in 52 years. But the
sheer amiability on display lately in the joint appearances of the
two homestretch contenders _ a black Democratic City Hall veteran
and a white Republican businessman _ makes this a campaign to
behold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing is that we love and respect each other,'' Sam
Katz, the Republican, beamed upon his rival, John F. Street, a
former City Council president. Street had no choice but to glow
right back, smile for smile, backslap for backslap, as a gathering
of elderly voters savored the closing moment of a campaign debate
almost eerie for its flauntings of mutual admiration.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar mood, a high-powered gathering of the city's
business leaders broke into its strongest applause Thursday night
at Drexel University as another debate ended with the moderator
feeling compelled to express wonder and gratitude at the scene:
Here were the two struggling rivals offering a civil dialogue free
of undertones of racial polarization in a city that reeled with
race-steeped attack politics a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   Can the candidates' demeanor possibly last through the final two
weeks of a contest that the polls rate as a toss-up, one
increasingly vulnerable to last-minute strategems? Are sallies of
polarizing attack ads waiting in the wings for the final bout of
television campaigning?
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates say no, not in a city that clearly has profited
more from coalition politics than racial polarity. Both candidates
say they will continue to play the roles that got them this far:
Street, a passionate 19-year City Council power broker who had to
win a bare-knuckles Democratic primary; and Katz, a sports world
deal maker and former Democrat who never uses the word Republican
as he tries to reach the city's critical swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not an election about race or about party,'' Katz, 49,
carefully assures voters, offering himself as a model of political
moderation and executive efficiency for a city that is 40 percent
black. ``It's about two different people with two different views
about how to take Philadelphia forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Street, a 56-year-old lawyer who ascended from ward-level
firebrand to party-machine maestro, must increasingly hope that
President Clinton's 11th-hour campaign visit on Oct. 29 will nip
the crossover trends lately suggested in the polls. Street has lost
his initial front-runner's status in this Democratic bastion,
leaving party loyalists and African-American leaders increasingly
edgy about his chances as polls register a one-point difference
between the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Street has never been a good people person,'' said Jerome
W. Mondesire, leader of the Philadelphia NAACP. ``And now it's
catching up with him.'' Mondesire said various minority and labor
leaders privately complained of ``disrespect'' in Street's manner
toward them and of lassitude in his campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   Street cites, to the contrary, his many endorsements. ``There is
no elected Democrat who isn't supporting me,'' he says, craving
resurgence from the party even as Katz talks of coalition politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Republican opponent,'' Street emphasizes amid the pragmatic
bonhomie of their faceoffs. ``He doesn't really want to be a
Republican, and I can understand that,'' Street continues. He
smiles as he reminds this city of 1.4 million that it usually
proves to be four-to-one Democratic by all the laws of political
instinct and registration.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the contest for critical white moderates, Street is
emphasizing Katz's qualified support of vouchers for private
schools as one tool the Republican says might prod education
improvement. ``I am opposed to vouchers,'' says Street, contending
that a Katz mayoralty would only deepen the city's grievances
against the Republican-dominated Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Katz, an unsuccessful candidate previously for mayor and
governor, is trying to project a businessman's acumen around his
proposals for deeper cuts than are planned in the city's wage tax
and for stronger public safety measures. In every speech, he
focuses on the estimated 150,000 people who have left Philadelphia
in the last decade. ``The people of this city want for their
families what they perceive to have happened to downtown
Philadelphia, which is resurgence, renewal and hope,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   With an expected turnout of 500,000 voters, the victory margin
for either candidate might be only a couple of thousand votes, with
each spending an estimated $5 million on the election. Assorted
pieces of the electoral landscape are being closely surveyed for
definitive signs, like the move by organized gay men and lesbians
to spare the Democrats embarrassment and endorse neither candidate
rather than come out against Street, whom some denounce as
homophobic.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the furious homestretch politicking at street corners and
civic groups, strategists are consulting the history of crucial
crossover votes, notably the victory of the city's first and thus
far only black Mayor, W. Wilson Goode, in 1983. He drew 20 percent
of white voters, a high-water mark comparable to the current
popularity among blacks of Mayor Edward Rendell, who is white.
</P>
<P>
   But the current race offers little of the excitement and voter
surge of 16 years ago, when the city made history in electing Goode
and closing out the polarizing era of Mayor Frank Rizzo. Instead,
there is a sense of anticlimax veering toward crankiness among
voters after the eight years of Rendell, a period of urban
renaissance that has put a fresh gleam on Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates warmly laud Rendell. But voter forums have
openly questioned whether Rendell's shoes could ever be filled by
Street, whose strength lies more in narrow-gauge back-room power
politics, or by Katz, whose forte has been in self-driven
salesmanship and the brokering of public-private financial schemes
for sports stadiums and American Indian gambling casinos.

</P>
<P>
   For all the amity on the stump that seems to be working well for
Katz as the race tightens, the Republican was a strategic player in
the Democratic primary, running attack ads against the black
candidate Democrats contend he feared most, John White, a seasoned
government official. White finished third in the primary and
shocked the city when he eventually turned against Street and
endorsed Katz as ``the best choice'' for the city. This has left
Katz predicting a tide of victory from ``thousands'' of black
crossover votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands, Sam?'' Street interjected at one of their debates.
He has charged that some sort of cynical payoff was promised to
White. This is denied by Katz, who, as a Democrat until 1990, first
courted black alliances in managing the 1976 campaign of
congressman William Gray, one of the city's most respected black
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign winds down, Street roams the city reciting his
long record in public service. ``I have maturity, background,
experience,'' he declares, tirelessly speaking in the first person
as he looks back on such highlights as fighting alongside Rendell
to steer the city from financial collapse. ``I think I've made a
difference in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Katz talks more of the future, but he hardly shies
from the first person. ``I'm not bull-jiving you,'' he snapped back
during a citizens' forum, using one voter's city idiom to rebuff
her doubts that he can ever pull off a historic political upset
next month.

CZECHS' WALL FOR GYPSIES STIRS PROTEST ACROSS EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   USTI NAD LABEM, Czech Republic _ At about 4 a.m. on Oct. 13, 80
uniformed policemen marched down a central street of this depressed
town in the Rust Belt of northern Bohemia and sealed it off. Within
a day, construction workers erected a wall 70 yards long down the
street, separating the two-family homes of Czechs on one side from
the decrepit communal apartment buildings inhabited mostly by Gypsy
families on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Defying the appeals of the Czech government, Parliament,
President Vaclav Havel and the European Union, the City Council
insisted that the Czechs of Maticni Street need protection from the
noise, garbage and crime that they claim is brought by their Gypsy
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a concentration camp,'' shouted one of the
Gypsies, 57-year-old Pavel Moro, gesturing toward the row of police
officers who were guarding the site. ``If they want to build
concentration camps, they might as well build gas chambers for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The janitor of one of the run-down communal buildings, Josef
Lacko, said: ``I want to have the same rights as the Czechs. I
don't want to live behind a wall. This is a free country.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials remained unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fence stands here as a symbol of law and order,'' said
Ladislav Hruska, the mayor of Usti nad Labem. ``And please, don't
call it a wall. It's a fence. I insist.''
</P>
<P>
   Hruska told reporters gathered for the construction of the
``fence'' _ actually a 6-foot-high structure covered with concrete
_ that it was needed to prevent the Gypsy children from running
into the street, making noise and leaving a mess outside the
Czechs' windows. Now, he said, the Gypsy children will keep to
their playground. ``It's for their own protection,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   His words had resonance far beyond this once-quaint, now
run-down city on the Elbe River, close to the border with what was
East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Romano Prodi, head of the commission that runs the European
Union, issued a statement as Hruska's fence went up that insisted:
``Europe will never accept new walls separating European citizens
from one another. We have had enough walls in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Guenter Verheugen, the German official overseeing the European
Union's intended enlargement, has denounced the wall as a gross
violation of human rights and urged the Czech government _ which is
one of six currently negotiating membership in the 15-nation
trading bloc _ to take immediate action.
</P>
<P>
   Hruska rejected the criticism. ``I consider it a great
hypocrisy,'' he said. ``Other countries also have racial problems,
some far greater than ours. If the EU wants to be dictating what I
should do, well, then I don't want to be part of such an EU.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the evening of Oct. 13 _ when the Usti wall was already
nearly complete _ the Czech Parliament rescinded the City Council's
decision and declared its actions illegal. Under Czech law,
however, such a parliamentary decision is not binding on local
governments dealing with municipal matters.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the government's human rights commissioner, Petr
Uhl, a veteran of the dissident movement against Communism,
promised that the wall would be removed, one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   The construction is ``vulgar and unpardonable,'' he said. ``If
necessary, we will use state police troops.''
</P>
<P>
   European officials have also noted that the situation of the
estimated 300,000 Gypsies in this country of 10 million remains
characterized by widespread discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Gypsy activists say the unemployment rate among Gypsies is as
high as 90 percent. They often complain about discrimination at
labor offices and abuse of their children in schools. Earlier this
year, 12 families filed a lawsuit against the Czech education
system, which routinely transfers Gypsy pupils to schools for
retarded children.
</P>
<P>
   Czech Gypsies _ as well as foreigners living in the Czech
Republic _ have also been subjected to violence from skinheads and
neo-Nazi groups. Such discrimination has spurred several waves of
large-scale immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand Gypsies have sought asylum in various west
European countries. Many were forced to return when their
applications were rejected; others are still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, which has had the largest such influx of Czech Gypsies,
is seriously considering requiring visas for all Czechs as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are elements of apartheid in this society,'' said Ondrej
Gina, who is an advocate for Gypsies _ or Roma, as they are also
known _ and a Czech representative of the International Roma
Congress. ``Immigration is the only thing left for us.''

3 SLAYINGS HIGHLIGHT DANGER FOR U.N. WORKERS IN THE FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ About the only good news for the United Nations
last week was that seven of its staff members _ military observers,
a doctor and their translator _ were released after being taken
hostage Wednesday in the breakaway Abkhazia region of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the United Nations lost one official in Kosovo and
two in Burundi, all in what appeared to be deliberately fatal
attacks against U.N. workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.N. staff have become moving targets,'' Louise Frechette, the
deputy secretary-general, told the General Assembly on Thursday,
asking member nations to take steps to give aid workers better
protection.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, Valentin Krumov, a Bulgarian
who lived in Queens, was attacked on the street by a mob after he
answered a question in Serbo-Croatian, the language in which he was
apparently asked what time it was. Serbo-Croatian is spoken by
Serbs, who now live under intense pressure from Albanians, the
majority in Kosovo. Krumov, who spoke several languages and whose
native Bulgarian closely resembles the Serbian tongue, had just
arrived in Pristina and was taking an evening walk on Mother Teresa
Street.
</P>
<P>
   In Burundi, the director of the Unicef office, Luis Zuniga, a
Chilean, and a Dutch logistics officer for the World Food Program,
Saskia van Meijenfeldt, were among nine people lined up and shot at
a relief center by a gang who may have been Hutu rebels in a
Tutsi-governed country in Africa's Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the United Nations announced that it was ending most
aid programs in Burundi, leaving only emergency personnel behind.
Sergio Vieira de Mello, the under secretary-general who is in
charge of humanitarian affairs, went to Burundi on Thursday to meet
with relief workers and government officials; he said in the
capital, Bujumbura, that Hutu rebels had complained that the United
Nations was helping the government relocate Hutu people.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as conflicts around the world have changed in
character, with relief workers and other civilians bearing the
brunt of the casualties, the number of U.N. employees killed in the
field has risen sharply. This year, 13 U.N. staff members have been
killed. Last year, the number was 27.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations also came under criticism last week in
Washington. American officials _ apparently following similar
criticism voiced in late July by British Prime Minister Tony Blair
_ accused the High Commissioner for Refugees of failing to move
fast enough to aid more than a million refugees who were driven
from Kosovo by Serbian attacks during NATO's bombing war against
Yugoslavia earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee agency more often than not finds itself being
criticized in large emergencies, officials say, contending that
there is a limited amount they can do with a small budget if U.N.
member nations do not act quickly to provide money and equipment.
In Kosovo, NATO itself did not anticipate the Serbian attacks or
refugee migration, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In East Timor, where an international peacekeeping force is now
restoring calm after a wave of violence that followed a vote for
independence, the High Commissioner for Refugees office now has
another sudden emergency on its hands. It is trying to wrest
control from Indonesia of more than 100,000 refugees who were
driven into West Timor _ which Indonesia still controls _ over a
few days in early September, and to try to return them to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Some private agencies have already complained that the refugee
agency is working too slowly, given that many refugees are thought
to be under threat from pro-Indonesian militias.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan _ The pipeline here was built with the
breathtaking speed born of a poor, violent nation seeking economic
redemption through the discovery of oil. In just a year, 936 miles
of steel were welded together and sunk a yard beneath the sandy
soil of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came almost as swiftly. On Sept. 19, exactly 20 days
after the first shipment of Sudanese oil was exported to Asia,
rebels bombed the new pipeline. The oil stopped for four days. No
one doubts it will soon happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do they expect us to do?'' asked Yousif Kowa Makki, who
commands rebels in the Nuba mountains, near the pipeline, though
they apparently were not involved in this attack. ``Do we wait
until they have enough money to come and kill us? What we really
have to do is stop that oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in the conflict in Sudan _ Africa's largest country,
cursed by the continent's longest-running civil war _ have suddenly
gotten much higher. Oil was discovered here as early as the 1920s,
but the nation's Islamic government has only now brought it to
market _ creating an irresistible target for the various rebel
groups and, for the government, a valuable asset it might very well
lose.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether the oil will be a force for peace or
for yet more war and the sad extension of poverty in a land of
potential wealth. The answer is of particular interest to the
outside world, which this year will spend more than a quarter of a
billion dollars in relief in Sudan's war zones.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent 16 years of fighting and famine, estimates of
the number of dead run as high as two million people. The war is in
many ways a religious conflict, pitting the Muslim north against
the Christian south. It has made men on both sides of the conflict
rich and spawned ghastly abuses of human rights, including the
increased abduction of slaves from the south to the north.
</P>
<P>
   The National Islamic Front, which took power a decade ago and
has been accused of most, but not all, of those abuses, says it now
realizes the war cannot be won.
</P>
<P>
   In what many skeptical diplomats and aid workers are calling a
``charm offensive,'' some Sudanese officials say the huge oil
profits must be shared around the nation to build roads, schools
and irrigation projects. Sudan stands to earn $200 million a year
to start, or 20 percent of the economy, rising to three or four
times that in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the government sells the view that the oil will
finally develop Sudan, and that is an incentive for all sides to
agree to peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of a permanent and just settlement very little can be
done, even with oil,'' said Hasan Abdin, under secretary in the
Ministry of Foreign Relations. ``The government is genuine about
peacemaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdin, though, is considered a moderate in a government
undecided over whether to continue along its inward, oppressive and
authoritarian course or become more open and friendly to outsiders
and the various factions among its own people. No one knows which
way it will go.
</P>
<P>
   Several diplomats, aid workers and many Sudanese themselves
suspect the government will use the windfall to buy more weapons.
That would keep the war going and possibly help shore up the
National Islamic Front, whose popularity is flagging under a
worsening economy, weariness with the war and almost too many rebel
groups to count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think it's obvious?'' said Jemera Rone, an expert on
Sudan with Human Rights Watch in Washington. ``They will be having
income they didn't have before. They will be an oil exporter, which
puts them in an exclusive club of countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they believe that they will gain alliances through the
business community in many countries. I'm afraid it might dampen
their enthusiasm for any compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   That view is shared by a growing group of protesters against
Talisman Energy Inc., the largest independent oil company in
Canada, which owns 25 percent of the pipeline project (The $1.2
billion project is also financed by the state oil companies of
China, Malaysia and Sudan).
</P>
<P>
   Along with Canadian church groups and some Talisman investors,
New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi has said he is considering
divesting the city's $4 million in Talisman stock. The company, he
said, ``is cavalier about its moral and social responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Talisman officials strongly deny the oil will fuel the war.
Ralph R. Capeling, general manager for Talisman in Sudan, said
government officials regularly assure Talisman of their intention
to seek peace and share the oil money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe that many people could lie in unison,''
Capeling said. ``I do believe they are sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the government is not sincere, history hints that
Talisman may be one of the first to pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s Chevron spent tens of millions of dollars to
develop two oil fields along the dividing line between north and
south. In 1983, the civil war reignited. In February 1984, rebels
attacked a Chevron base near the town of Bentiu, killing three oil
workers. Not long afterward, Chevron pulled out of Sudan _ and in
the years since, Sudan has fought itself to economic and political
exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   It is these same oil fields that Talisman and the other
companies have developed and that are now pumping some 120,000
barrels a day from fields near the town of Heglig 1,000 miles north
to Port Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Talisman officials say, production will rise to about
160,000 barrels a day. Once all the pumping stations are in place,
the pipeline will be able to handle 450,000 barrels a day
</P>
<P>
   Capeling said the two oil fields they are developing _ known as
Heglig and Unity, near Bentiu _ have reserves of 1.2 billion
barrels of oil. Both the north and south claim that these fields
fall in their historical zones.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, there is suspected to be much more oil in Sudan _
enough, the government hopes, to raise production to one million
barrels a day by 2005 although many of the reserves lie
indisputably in the south.
</P>
<P>
   And so, experts say, the warring factions in Sudan are forced
either to find peace or fight a much more intense war.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If there is to be peace, the questions have gotten no simpler
over the last years of fighting: some of the southern rebels want
the south to secede completely, while others want regional
autonomy, freedom from Islamic law and a hefty share of the oil
profits. The government has been reluctant to compromise, though
recently it has made some gestures, like legalizing opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Both the government and the southern rebels, who include the
main fighting group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army, are
gearing up for yet another round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   If it is to be more war, the oil will be the biggest target, as
the attack on Sept. 19 proved. What is even more disturbing for the
government, that attack appears to have been carried out not by
southern rebels but by the military wing of the Umma Party,
northerners and fellow Muslims fighting the extremism of the
current powers-that-be.
</P>
<P>
   If the war intensifies, the government risks losing its hopes
for development and outside investment and respect. It also may
lose a key ally, the former southern rebel commander Riek Machar,
who joined the government in 1997 after a peace agreement promised
the south a share of the oil money.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here, Machar, already rumored to be impatient
and undermined in the government, said flatly he would rejoin the
fight in the south if the oil money went to buy more weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be a party to it,'' he said. ``The war cannot be
won.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meantime, Talisman says it is urging the government to make
peace but is prepared for war. In Colombia, a pipeline owned
largely by Occidental has been bombed 65 times this year alone,
with what oil analysts say is only minimal disruption of the oil
flow. Talisman has built regular repairs into the cost of doing
business in a place like Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we don't get a lot of practice repairing explosions,''
Capeling said. ``But if we do, we hope we'll get to where we can do
it really fast.''

   LOS ANGELES _ It was the big one that wasn't quite, a magnitude
7.0 earthquake that struck the Southern California desert early
Saturday morning, shaking buildings from Los Angeles to Las Vegas,
prompting sporadic power failures and knocking an Amtrak train off
its tracks, but producing no reports of serious injuries or damage.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:46 a.m., millions of Southern Californians were awakened by
the shake-and-roll of the quake, centered in the Mojave Desert, 32
miles north of Joshua Tree, 100 miles east of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak said its Southwest Chief en route from Chicago to Los
Angeles derailed in the Mojave Desert near Ludlow, though the
passenger cars remained upright. Sharon Kososinski, one of the 155
passengers on the 25-car train, told CNN that most were sound
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rocking and rolling, back at the sleeper cars,'' Ms.
Kososinski said. ``That's the part of the train that's completely
off the tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   She said one passenger dislocated her shoulder. Amtrak said it
planned to take the passengers to Los Angeles by bus.
</P>
<P>
   With a preliminary magnitude of 7.0 on the Richter scale, the
quake was larger than the 6.7 magnitude Northridge earthquake of
1994, which killed more than 60 people and caused more than $20
billion worth of damage in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   But because Saturday's earthquake was centered in a remote,
unpopulated area near the old mining town of Hector, greater damage
was avoided.
</P>
<P>
   There were estimates that 5,000 to 10,000 people lost power in
Los Angeles and there were scattered transformer explosions. Downed
power lines started small brush fires near Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the earthquake were more pronounced near the
epicenter.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Serrano, a California Highway Patrol dispatcher in Barstow,
told The Associated Press that a bridge on Interstate 40 was
heavily damaged but the freeway remained open.
</P>
<P>
   The shaking woke up tourists in Las Vegas, more than 150 miles
from the epicenter, and for a few scary moments it even stopped the
action in the casinos that never close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure exactly what was going on, but then I saw the
signs swaying and the leaves on the fake palms rustling, so I
thought it must be an earthquake,'' Candy McCain, a visitor from
Phoenix sitting at a slot machine in the Mirage told the AP.
``Everybody stopped for a minute. Then they started playing again.
Not too long after it hit, it got even busier than before.''

JUDGE THWARTS GUN SALES BAN IN LOS ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A federal judge has cleared the way for the
continued sale of firearms at the largest gun show in the United
States here, overturning an ordinance by county officials that
would have banned such sales.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County adopted the ordinance last month banning the
sale of guns and ammunition on its property, presenting an
immediate challenge to a gun show on the county fairgrounds,
scheduled for the end of this month, that draws 2,000 exhibitors
and 35,000 visitors. Great Western Shows Inc., the organizer of the
event, filed a lawsuit against the county seeking to have the
measure ruled unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In his order on Friday, Judge Richard Paez of U.S. District
Court ruled that state law, which allows the sale of guns at gun
shows under certain restrictions, pre-empted the local ordinance
banning such transactions, and that the ``balance of hardships''
tipped in favor of the show's organizers, who have been sponsoring
the event for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many exhibitors threatened to pull out of the show if they were
not allowed to sell their wares.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling's impact on municipalities seeking to pass similar
bans is unclear. Paez said he was setting aside for the moment the
serious constitutional questions like those involving commercial
free speech, leaving them to be litigated in a subsequent
proceeding. Instead, the judge said he was following case law that
struck down another California county's efforts to end firearms
sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Nordyke vs. Santa Clara County, the courts
rejected Santa Clara's efforts to ban handgun sales at gun shows
through a lease amendment with the company that managed its
property.
</P>
<P>
   Paez's ruling ignored arguments from the show's lawyers that
banning the sale of guns would undermine the exchange of political
and historical speech at the event, and that the county did not
have jurisdiction over the fairgrounds, because it was located in a
city.
</P>
<P>
   Zev Yaroslavsky, a county supervisor who supported the
ordinance, said an appeal would be filed.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Seger, the general manager of Great Western Shows, said he
was ``relieved'' by the judge's ruling.

OLD EUROPEAN TONGUES FLOURISH IN REVIVAL OF REGIONAL CULTURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEVEN, France _ Day and night on France's windy western coast,
Radio Kerne transmits a bright mix of music sprinkled with local
news. It is a new station run by young people for a young audience
_ but with a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Radio Kerne's operators are volunteers, working with the
zeal of missionaries. Their preferred music comes from bagpipes and
flutes. And they broadcast only in Breton, a Celtic language spoken
for more than 2,000 years that until recently seemed doomed to
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving the culture of Brittany is very much on people's
minds,'' said Isig Flatres, the station manager. ``This generation
is no longer embarrassed about speaking or being Breton.''
</P>
<P>
   What is more, this language of the druids _ who did not use
writing _ is now out on the Internet with its own Web sites. After
being banished for more than a century from Brittany's schools, the
language has found new defenders in the pro-Breton movement, and
its activists are developing software, translating centuries-old
texts and sending their children to new bilingual schools that
teach Breton and French.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting a growing trend in Europe, all the minority languages
of France _ banned after the revolution in the name of equality _
are getting a new lease on life. Since the Socialist government
took office in 1997, greater tolerance has allowed for more
teaching of Occitan, Basque, Corsican and Alsatian in France's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The change is not undisputed: President Jacques Chirac, several
government ministers and the nation's highest court have weighed in
on the unresolved argument over whether it is constitutional to
promote a language other than French.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching regional languages is ``an enterprise that can destroy
the unity of the nation,'' said Maurice Druon, the head of the
French Academy. ``We risk pulverizing French. Why sacrifice a
glorious language to local dialects?''
</P>
<P>
   But the renaissance of local cultures is not confined to France.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the more intriguing side effects of a uniting
Europe: as national boundaries fade within the 15-member European
Union, more political power flows to Brussels and more countries
beg to join the group, local cultures and languages are reasserting
their strength.
</P>
<P>
   And while a blanket of sameness has settled over consumer trends
and styles in Europe, historians say that more people are
interested in protecting minority languages and asserting local
differences than at any other time in this century.
</P>
<P>
   Gaelic has returned to schools in Scotland &UR; ,  &LR; which has &UR;  &LR; gained
more political power from the once highly centralized government in
London. Northern Italy has courses in Friulian. Dutch radio
stations broadcast in Frisian and Limburgs. ``In Finland, we can
now get the news in Saami,'' said Tom Moring, a Finnish linguist.
</P>
<P>
   Regionalism is perhaps strongest in Spain, where Basque is
making a comeback in the north, bolstered by the local government.
In Catalonia, Barcelona's authorities insist on doing all official
business in Catalan, which now prevails over Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brussels bureaucrats may try to steamroller us into oneness,
but people are stubborn,'' said Hans Magnus Enzensberger, a German
who has written often on European and regional identity. ``The more
global and uniform our civilization, the more people want to anchor
themselves in their own culture. The fact is, Europe has a few
thousand years of settled cultures _ it can't simply turn into an
American-type melting pot.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students of the trend believe the identity of Europe's
ethnic groups is strengthening because anchors like religion and
nationality have weakened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a citizen of Europe is still rather vague, rather
abstract as an identity,'' Moring said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Europe-wide institutions are helping in the belief that
grass-roots movements fostering local pride are good for democracy.
The Council of Europe, a 41-nation group that promotes democracy
and human rights, has adopted a charter pledging to encourage the
use of indigenous languages in schools, media and public life. The
council says that of the 500 million or so Europeans, more than 50
million speak a local language that is not their country's official
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has created the Bureau for Lesser-used
Languages, which finances projects such as developing Internet
browsers in Welsh and cartoon books in Alsatian. Next, it promises
a news agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the media report on ethnic groups, it's usually about
conflict,'' said Bertrand Menciassi of the language bureau. ``We
want to provide some balance. There's so much else going on that's
very rich.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Brittany, some linguists wonder whether the revival is not
coming too late. Of Brittany's 4 million people, only about 10
percent still know Breton, and most of those are elderly. But
10,000 adults are enrolled in evening classes in Breton, and in the
past 20 years, the Diwan movement _ Diwan is Breton for ``seed'' _
has built up 34 Breton-speaking schools, with 5,000 pupils.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie le Gal, the director of a Diwan school in Lorient, said
that unlike state-run institutions, teachers are short of money and
materials. They have adapted some textbooks by pasting Breton
passages over them.
</P>
<P>
   In her class, 7-year-olds were learning to read and write in a
language that has few ties to French. For zero, they wrote
``mann;'' the word ``keriaden'' means village. Breton linguists
working with Celtic specialists in Ireland, Scotland and Wales have
created modern words such as skinwell (television), pellgomz
(telephone) and urzhiataer (computer).
</P>
<P>
   The cultural revival may thrive if it continues to produce
economic benefits. Julien le Mentec has just opened his second
Breton tavern in Lorient, where he serves local dishes and offers
Breton music and language courses to a clientele mostly under 25.
Young activists network with Celtic counterparts in Wales,
Cornwall, Scotland and Ireland. This year's Inter Celtic Music
Festival in Lorient drew 400,000 visitors, many of them from
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The young people have helped the language and culture to open
up, which may be a key to survival, said Michel Le Bris, a Breton
novelist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now accept that our identity can have several layers,'' Le
Bris said. ``We can feel European and French and Breton all at
once. But the answer is to remain open. If not, you become a
bastion, a Serbia.''

STORM CAUSES POWER LAPSES AND FLOODING IN FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Hurricane Irene pushed its way up the East
Coast Saturday, slipping out of Florida after knocking down trees
and power lines, spawning tornadoes, leaving more than a million
people without power and causing at least five deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was expected to stay close to the East Coast, and
forecasters feared it could gain strength and dump several inches
of rain on the flood-weary Carolinas through the weekend. A
hurricane watch issued Saturday stretched north to Cape Hatteras,
N.C. The storm had winds of 75 mph.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the hurricane has been blamed for killing two people in
Cuba and five people near Fort Lauderdale, who were electrocuted by
downed power lines.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Friday, as much as 18 inches of wind-driven rain
caused scattered flooding over hundreds of miles in Florida, from
Key West to West Palm Beach, where streets were nearly empty early
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident, a 12-year-old boy from Cooper City, southwest
of Fort Lauderdale, was electrocuted after stepping on a downed
power line in knee-deep water, Broward County Emergency officials
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few towns north, three teen-age boys, two of them twins,
and their 50-year-old mother were found dead in 10 inches of water.
A downed power line was found under the boys, Broward County
emergency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared a state of emergency for Florida,
authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Administration to
coordinate disaster relief efforts with state officials. The
emergency declaration covered 28 counties from Key West to central
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, the police said more than 60 streets were under at
least 6 inches of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of rain in this storm,'' said Judy Gray, a
meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``We're
completely soaked here at the Hurricane Center. We can only go in
and out through one of our doors.''
</P>
<P>
   With winds of 80 mph on shore, the hurricane turned residential
streets, strip mall parking lots and golf courses into rivers and
lakes, some several feet deep. The flooding engulfed whole cars.
</P>
<P>
   Downed power lines and palm trees blocked many roads in
Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Okeechobee, west of Palm Beach, stood at a little over 17
feet, a foot above normal for this time of year. The U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers was keeping watch on the lake's dike, built
after a hurricane killed thousands of people in the area in the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are indications that the lake pool elevations may rise
to levels that historically have caused concern,'' the Corps said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The storm took many ordinary Floridians and experts by surprise.
Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center had predicted that it
would hit the west coast of Florida, just skirting the other end of
the South Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   But the storm changed direction in midafternoon on Friday,
washing over the three-county area. The eye of the storm passed
over Boca Raton, in South Palm Beach County, late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storm had a mind of its own,'' Ms. Gray said. ``It doesn't
always go where we think it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains and blinding winds unloaded over 2 feet of water in
some areas, causing lines of cars to stall on busy roads and on
Interstate 95. The storm also caused more than a dozen accidents on
the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   Most airlines suspended service to South Florida, and Miami
International Airport was shut down for 3{ hours on Friday. At Fort
Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, a power line was cut
off, shutting off power to the air traffic control tower and to the
runway lights.

REPORT CALLS FOR NEW FOCUS ON AID FOR MINORITY STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JODI WILGOREN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A task force of prominent educators has found that the
performance gap between black, Hispanic and American Indian
students and their white and Asian counterparts persists across the
socioeconomic spectrum, from kindergarten through graduate school,
according to a report being released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of discussion about the most economically and
educationally disadvantaged students, the College Board's National
Task Force on Minority High Achievement has collected the results
of an array of research showing that even in middle-class suburbs
and elite colleges, African-Americans, Hispanics and American
Indians lag behind, failing to make the honor roll or earn similar
plaudits in proportion to non-Hispanic whites and Asians.
</P>
<P>
   In sounding the alarm, the task force calls for a strategy of
``affirmative development'' that would emphasize minority
performance at all levels rather than focus on enrollment in
colleges and universities. The College Board plans to spend up to
$10 million in the next decade researching and replicating programs
that produce high-achieving black and Hispanic students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chronic underachievement among minority students is one of the
most critical problems facing our country today,'' said Gaston
Caperton, president of the College Board, a national association of
educational institutions that administers the SAT and other
standardized tests. ``It is particularly troubling because we are
not just talking about disadvantaged youngsters. Even minority
students from relatively wealthy families with well-educated
parents do not typically perform as well as white and Asian
students from similar backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most significant findings in the report, which defines
minority students as black, Hispanic or American Indian, as opposed
to whites and Asian-Americans, are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Only 10 percent of the 4th-, 8th- and 12th-grade students who
scored at the highest level on the National Assessment of
Educational Progress tests in reading, math and science were
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Minorities earned only 13 percent of the nation's bachelor's
degrees, 11 percent of professional degrees and 6 percent of the
doctoral degrees in 1995, when they made up about 30 percent of the
under-18 population.
</P>
<P>
   _ At mainstream colleges and universities, minorities earn
significantly lower grades than white and Asian students who scored
similarly on entrance exams.
</P>
<P>
   _ An education gender gap is particularly acute among
minorities: Over all, men earned 45 percent of all bachelor's
degrees in the mid-1990s, but among black students, only 36 percent
were awarded to men.
</P>
<P>
   ``These differences in educational outcomes contribute to large
disparities in life chances,'' says the report, called ``Reaching
the Top.'' Noting that minorities will make up 40 percent of
Americans under 18 by 2030, it adds, ``The rapid changes that are
taking place in the racial and ethnic composition of the nation
bring a new sense of urgency to this work.''
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations are broad and somewhat vague, but the task
force members, who include Henry Louis Gates Jr., head of the
Afro-American Studies Department of Harvard University, and James
P. Comer, of Yale University, an expert on children, lend a
seriousness to the work. The 31-member group is headed by Edmund W.
Gordon, a Yale professor emeritus of psychology, and Eugene H.
Cota-Robles, professor emeritus of biology at the University of
California at Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   The report calls on high schools and elementary schools to share
information on programs that improve minority achievement, and
urges collaboration between minority colleges and mainstream
institutions as well as between community colleges and four-year
schools.
</P>
<P>
   For colleges, the task force recommends that officials not only
look at grades and class rank, but also at course selection and
research projects. It says financial aid should be geared to high
achievement rather than just graduation.
</P>
<P>
   At the elementary and secondary levels, the task force urges the
Department of Education and individual districts to make high
achievement among minorities a top priority in both research and
public policy. The report also calls for an expansion of
supplementary education opportunities, like math clubs and science
fairs, to serve minorities and asks businesses and foundations to
devote money to these programs.
</P>
<P>
   The report highlights several examples where minorities have
achieved greater success, including a program at the University of
Maryland that recruits top black math students, and one at the
University of California at Davis that gives extra support to
biology majors. Both resulted in unusual numbers of minorities
graduating with honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can do it in biology in one place and in math in another
place,'' Cota-Robles said in an interview, ``can we find ways to
replicate it?''

GENERAL SAYS RIVAL KEPT HIM FROM LANDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: PAKISTAN-RDP)  
(lh) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ For months, Pakistan's prime minister and
its top general were two scorpions in a bottle. This week, both
struck.
</P>
<P>
   Their duel culminated on Tuesday in the cockpit of a Pakistan
International Airlines jet carrying Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf and at
least 190 other passengers to Karachi from Sri Lanka, where the
general had been sent by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to represent
Pakistan at a state celebration.
</P>
<P>
   At about 5 p.m., while the plane was in the air, Sharif
dismissed Musharraf, the army chief, and installed a crony, Lt.
Gen. Khwaja Ziauddin, the nation's top military intelligence
officer, in his place. It was a kind of civilian coup against the
military establishment, which had grown to loathe the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour and a half later, air traffic controllers denied
the plane permission to land at Karachi International Airport. For
more than an hour, the plane circled, its fuel running low and its
pilot fearing disaster. But it landed with minutes of fuel to
spare, and within hours Musharraf was in control of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PIA commercial flight was not allowed to land at Karachi
but was ordered to be diverted to anywhere outside Pakistan,
despite acute fuel shortages, imperiling the lives of all the
passengers,'' the general said in a brief televised address at 3
a.m. on Wednesday, hours after a military coup had installed him as
leader. ``Thanks be to Allah, this evil design was thwarted by
speedy army action.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened that night, as told by Musharraf, and amplified by
the army's spokesman, Brig. Rashid Qureshi, may be the basis for a
charge of attempted murder filed by the new military rulers of
Pakistan against Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   The deposed prime minister has been held incommunicado since
Tuesday night, when the army overthrew him, so his side of the
story has not been told. At a minimum, it appears, the plane was
diverted so that any effort by Musharraf to mobilize the army to
block his dismissal could be thwarted.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Flight PK805 was five and a half hours
out of Sri Lanka, nearing Karachi, and its pilot, Captain Sarwat,
had enough fuel to last about another hour. The control tower _
under orders from the top of the government, the army contends _
repeatedly refused the pilot's requests for clearance to land. He
was ordered to divert the plane, first to Oman, in the Persian
Gulf, then to India.
</P>
<P>
   Sarwat said he could not make it with the fuel he had on board.
He contacted the control towers in Pakistan's other major cities,
Lahore and Islamabad, and was rebuffed. Then a new order came from
the control tower at Karachi: land at a tiny regional airport
outside Karachi, at Nawabshah.
</P>
<P>
   The captain protested that his Airbus was too big for the
airstrip. According to the army, a police escort and a light plane
dispatched by Sharif were waiting for Musharraf at Nawabshah to
arrest him and transport him to Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was then that the army learned he was diverted,'' Qureshi
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the army's version of events, Musharraf went to the cockpit
and, with the pilot's help, relayed a call for help through Dubai,
an emirate in the Persian Gulf, to the army's corps commander in
Karachi, Lt. Gen. Muzaffar Usmani. Usmani and a commando team raced
to the Karachi Airport and seized control of the tower. The plane
landed with seven minutes of fuel to spare, Qureshi said.
</P>
<P>
   Next, troops seized the state-run television station in
Islamabad and surrounded the prime minister's marble residence.
They took over the international airports and cut the international
phone lines. Soon the television was back on the air, broadcasting
the classic coup soundtrack, canned military music, over taped
footage of military parades. Not a shot was fired as Sharif and his
government fell.
</P>
<P>
   The swift sureness of the army's actions strongly suggests that
the coup had been in the works for weeks. In fact, according to
military officials, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, headed by Musharraf,
and the regional corps commanders met on Sept. 18, Sept. 21 and
Sept. 23 and discussed what to do if Sharif moved against the army.
</P>
<P>
   Shireen Mazari, a Pakistani military analyst, said, ``It wasn't
exactly a secret what Nawaz Sharif's intentions were toward the
army.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army chief was aware,'' she said. ``This sort of move was
anticipated, and I guess they had a contingency plan for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The warning signs were clear enough. Pakistani officials and
politicians had been telling Washington about the likelihood of a
coup for more than a month, and the State Department issued a
highly unusual warning to Pakistan's military on Sept. 21, telling
it to stay in its barracks and out of politics.
</P>
<P>
   There were other signs in late September. After Sharif removed
or retired three senior army officers and the chief of the navy
resigned, the rumblings from the military were audible. Despite
that, Minister of Information Mushahid Hussain declared that
``complete harmony'' reigned between the government and the army.
Hussain, like Ziauddin, the intelligence chief, is now under
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 26, Sharif struck out at his enemies, banning political
rallies by the opposition under anti-terrorism statutes. He had
done something rare in Pakistani politics: united the opposition on
a single issue, which was his removal.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Sept. 30, in an unexpected move, he reappointed
Musharraf as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for two years,
while keeping him as chief of the army staff. Sharif apparently
intended to lull the general into complacency.

AS RATE OF VIOLENT CRIME DROPS, NEW ATTENTION TO GUN USE IN SUICIDE

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Nev.)  (rk) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the homicide rate down sharply since the early 1990s, the
number of Americans who commit suicide with guns each year now far
surpasses those who are killed by others with firearms, government
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the last year for which there are statistics available,
guns were used in 17,566 suicides, compared with 13,522 homicides,
according to the National Vital Statistics Report.
</P>
<P>
   This differential is helping focus new attention on suicide, a
subject that has long been taboo for many Americans and whose toll
was partly hidden from view by the violent crime wave of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   This month, a Senate committee is scheduled to hold the first
ever congressional hearings on suicide. The surgeon general, Dr.
David Satcher, recently made preventing suicide one of his
priorities, the first time a surgeon general has put suicide so
prominently on the public health agenda. And a new book by a
best-selling writer, Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, ``Night Falls Fast:
Understanding Suicide'' (Knopf), provides a comprehensive and
authoritative look at the subject, which mental health advocates
hope will have a major impact on public thinking about suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins
School of Medicine, concludes that 90 to 95 percent of people who
commit suicide had a diagnosable psychiatric illness and that the
number of young people who kill themselves in the United States has
tripled since the 1950s. She found that 60 percent of the 30,000
Americans who on average take their own lives each year do so with
guns, which works out to about 18,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, there were a total of 16,914 homicides in the
United States in 1998, according to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suicide is a public health tragedy,'' said Dr. Jamison, who
was the writer of ``An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and
Madness'' (Knopf, 1995), an account of her own struggle with
manic-depressive illness and suicide attempts. ``You don't hear the
outrage about suicide'' that is voiced about crime, she said,
``because I think families have been so stigmatized and reluctant
to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In her new book, Dr. Jamison cites a series of studies in recent
years showing that having a gun in the home increases the risk of
suicide. ``For young people in particular, who have a very
impulsive element to their suicide, having access to a means of
suicide that is quick and irrevocable like a gun is an unnecessary
risk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Flynn, the executive director of the National Alliance
for the Mentally Ill, which is made up of relatives of the
emotionally disturbed, said the easy access to guns in the United
States had compounded the suicide problem, especially as states
have dismantled their treatment system for the mentally ill and
health insurers have made it increasingly difficult for the
emotionally troubled to get treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easier and cheaper to get a gun and kill yourself than
to get treatment,'' Ms. Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   One recent study that looked at all people who legally bought
handguns in California in 1991 found that their risk of gun
suicides in the first week after purchase was more than 50 times
higher than for the population of the state as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of committing suicide with a gun remained at least
twice as high for the handgun purchasers as for the general
population of California during the next five years, said Dr. Garen
Wintemute, who presented a paper on the study at a 1998 meeting of
the American Public Health Association. Wintemute is an emergency
room physician and director of the Violence Prevention Research
Program at the University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate hearings will be held on Oct. 28 before the Labor,
Health and Human Services subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations
Committee and were arranged by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev. Reid has
been interested in the issues of suicide and mental illness since
his father, Harry Reid, a miner in the small desert town of
Searchlight, Nev., shot himself to death in 1972 after suffering
from depression.
</P>
<P>
   Among those expected to testify are Satcher, the Surgeon
General; Dr. Jamison and writer Danielle Steele, whose daughter
committed suicide.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over the last decade, both the annual number of suicides and the
number committed with guns have remained remarkably consistent. The
number of suicides was 30,232 in 1989, rose to a high of 31,284 in
1995 and then fell to 29,264 in 1998, according to the National
Vital Statistics Report, which is published by the National Center
for Health Statistics in Washington. The number involving firearms
in the same decade has ranged from a high of 18,940 in 1993 to a
low of 17,566 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Wintemute, who has examined records going back to 1920, said he
had found that for most of the century there were far more deaths
by suicide involving guns than homicides by firearms, until the
explosion in violent crime in the 1960s and again in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the murder rate has dropped, our attention is beginning to
refocus on suicide,'' Wintemute said.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher said in an interview that one of the most alarming
developments was that the suicide rate for black youths ages 10 to
19, which had traditionally been lower than that of white young
people, had more than doubled since 1980, to 4.5 per 100,000 in
1995 from 2.1 per 100,000 in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the problems that give rise to suicide among
African-American young people are related to the problems that give
rise to homicide, like hopelessness,'' said Satcher, who is a black
former emergency room doctor. ``This is certainly something we are
going to study.''
</P>
<P>
   In her new book, Dr. Jamison gives several reasons for the
tripling of suicide among young people since the 1950s. They
include better assessment by medical examiners, more access to
guns, earlier use of drugs and alcohol, which intensify the risk of
suicide in people with mental illness, and an earlier onset of
depression.

ENDORSEMENT BRINGS BIG LABOR TEST FOR GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mich., Miss., Ohio, Pa., Wis., N.Y., Calif., MEXICO)  (js) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The nation has lost 500,000 manufacturing jobs
over the last 18 months, despite the economic boom, and organized
labor's eagerness to see that trend reversed is shaping up as an
economic test for President Clinton and a huge political test for
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders say that even though Gore won the endorsement of
the AFL-CIO at its convention here, the administration will need to
take strong steps toward stopping the loss of manufacturing jobs if
the vice president hopes to excite rank-and-file workers to vote
for him.
</P>
<P>
   The job losses have become perhaps the most important issue to
labor unions in six large industrial states that are crucial swing
states in presidential elections: Illinois, Michigan, Missouri,
Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials from the powerful industrial unions in those
states _ the auto workers, the steelworkers and the machinists _
say that if Gore hopes to motivate union activists to campaign for
him and union members to vote for him in primaries and in the
general election, he must address labor's concerns on manufacturing
and the related subject of trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing for the vice president to get the AFL-CIO's
endorsement, and it's quite another to mobilize our members,'' said
George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America.
Becker met with Gore last week to press him on trade and
manufacturing. ``I have one overall goal in life,'' Becker said,
``and that is to reverse the trend of de-industrializing America
and to stop these insane trade laws that force our manufacturers to
compete against impossible odds.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which is a force in
the Middle West as well as in two important early primary states,
New York and California, is also warning the vice president that
the administration needs to do more to stop industrial decline. The
teamsters and auto workers were the only unions to oppose the
AFL-CIO endorsement of Gore, and both unions are demanding firmer
commitments from the administration and the vice president on trade
if they are to back him.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of these pressures, Clinton and Gore have called for
some labor-friendly provisions in trade treaties and have created a
task force to study the plight of manufacturing. While labor
leaders are encouraged by these steps, they say the important test
will be what specific actions the administration takes _ and
whether Gore will disagree with the administration if he feels it
does not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters for the vice president, many
middle-of-the-road Democrats and business executives are cautioning
the administration and Gore not to become tools of labor and not to
comply with demands that they deem protectionist.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions, which are considered vital to turning out the
Democratic base in general elections, have a long wish list for the
administration, and they hope the vice president will press labor's
viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders say that whatever reservations they have about the
administration and Gore on trade, the views of former Sen. Bill
Bradley, the vice president's only rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination, are no better.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Unions want Clinton and Gore to make sure that any future trade
agreements include penalties against trading partners that allow
violations of minimal international labor standards, like child
labor rules. Unions oppose admitting China to the World Trade
Organization, saying a country that uses prison labor and bars
independent trade unions should not be given more access to the
U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   While avoiding their blatantly protectionist rhetoric of a few
years ago, labor leaders have attacked the record trade deficit,
which may top $300 billion this year. They also dislike the strong
dollar, which has cost U.S. manufacturing jobs by making American
goods more expensive overseas and by making foreign goods cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lehane, a spokesman for the Vice President's
campaign, said, ``Al Gore agrees with the many representatives of
labor, including those from the industrial unions, that there is
nothing more important that we can do to make sure we can expand
our prosperity to all portions of the country, and that includes,
most prominently, our industrial sector _ our steelworkers, our
auto workers, our truck drivers, our shipbuilders.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1.4 million-member teamsters union has its own specific
demand, that the administration stop a provision in the North
American Free Trade Agreement from taking effect on Jan. 1. That
provision would lift restrictions that bar Mexican truckers from
driving in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing for continued restrictions on cross-border trucking,
teamster officials argue that most Mexican trucks are unsafe. They
fear that a huge influx of low-wage Mexican drivers would wipe out
the jobs of thousands of American truckers.
</P>
<P>
   In a warning to Gore, Michael Mathis, the teamsters' political
director, said, ``I think we'd be very much less excited about Gore
if the border is open Jan. 1. We'll be very, very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Many union leaders have told the vice president to heed a lesson
from 1994, when the Democrats lost control of the House. That year,
union members were so angry with Clinton and the Democrats over
passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement that an unusual
number of union members decided not to vote, giving the Republicans
an edge in many districts.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   An early test of whether the administration and Gore will pass
labor's scrutiny on trade will come in Seattle on Nov. 30, when the
World Trade Organization's ministerial meeting begins. The meeting
is expected to set ground rules for a new multiyear round of talks
aimed at liberalizing world trade.
</P>
<P>
   The unions want future trade pacts to include basic labor
protections and to give countries the right to impose penalties
against nations that violate minimum labor standards, like a ban on
child labor. But many companies and third-world countries say
labor-related provisions have no place in trade agreements, and
they are pressuring Clinton and his vice president to ignore
labor's pleas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got to be very careful about how they handle Seattle,
notwithstanding labor's endorsement of Gore,'' said Jay Mazur,
chairman of the AFL-CIO's international affairs committee and
president of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile
Employees. ``Remember, our people are upset about losing 500,000
manufacturing jobs.''

<P>
   Basketball star Wilt Chamberlain, who died last week of a heart
attack at the age of 63, had a taciturn demeanor as a player, but
he was best-known off the court for bragging in his autobiography
that he had had sex with some 20,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that wasn't nearly the half of Chamberlain's boasting
in ``A View From Above'' (Villard Books, 1991), which opened with
his disclaimer that although he was a big man, ``I am certainly not
 &UR; the &LR;  Big Man'' _ God _ in case anyone was confused.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most curious are Chamberlain's comments on race. At
one point in the book, he is derisive toward Al Campanis, the Los
Angeles Dodgers executive forced to resign in 1987 after he said on
national television that blacks ``may not have the necessities''
for management in baseball, and that blacks aren't good swimmers
``because they don't have the buoyancy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Chamberlain asks why the Dodgers had no black
third-base coaches under Campanis. Was it because blacks ``can't
say stop?'' he asked. ``Or because they don't know when to go
home?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at another point, Chamberlain offers his own views about
racial differences between black and white basketball players,
which attracted very little attention at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is because there were juicier headlines in a former
star athlete claiming to have bedded 20,000 women, and because
Chamberlain was not an executive in a major sport using racial
stereotypes on ``Nightline'' to justify racial disparities in
management.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Chamberlain wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Men of color seem to be blessed with specific physical
attributes that benefit them in several sports, particularly
basketball. They have explosive muscle power that translates into
speed, quickness, and jumping ability (three major ingredients
needed to be a good jock, a good basketball player in particular).
</P>
<P>
   ``And there is another element that makes men of color tend to
stand out above the rest. For lack of a better word, let's call it
`flair' _ which translates into showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``A perfect example of this can be seen if you examine the
playing styles of the two best passers in the game of basketball
today, Magic Johnson and John Stockton,'' Chamberlain continued.
``At present, Stockton out-assists Magic _ on a per game basis _ by
approximately one assist. But Magic has that flair and Stockton
doesn't. It makes Magic appear as if he's doing much more than
Stockton. It's not ability, it's style. And in basketball, men of
color have all the style. Think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds, ``I suppose this flair can be traced back to
environmental conditioning or heritage or even to the Harlem
Globetrotters, the true forefathers of all the showmanship that has
become the trademark of so many stars _ all men of color _ in the
NBA.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Step outside the United States for even a few days,
and the country has never looked more powerful: An economy that
won't quit, a military that has never faced fewer direct
challenges, a popular and business culture that has become the
world's most eagerly-sought export.
</P>
<P>
   But take one step back into Washington and it's easy to wonder
if you are talking about the same country. The president of the
most powerful nation at its most powerful moment has rarely looked
weaker than he did last week, when the Senate overwhelmingly
defeated the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton responded with an hour-long recitation of the
dangers of a ``new isolationism.'' Republicans shot back that
Clinton had cynically sought to turn a popular but hard-to-enforce
treaty into a political weapon. Bickering along these lines will
doubtless go on for months. But it masks the real debate.
</P>
<P>
   The test ban treaty was only the latest of a number of divisive
issues in the capital that share a common subtext: An argument not
over whether the United States is strong, but over how it should
use its power. Should it strut the global beach alone, or leverage
that power by accepting restraints on its freedom to act?
</P>
<P>
   It is that debate that has eroded the ``vital center'' that
Clinton talks about so often in his laments about the disappearance
of bipartisanship in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself, who has been episodic in focusing on foreign
policy, has ranged all over the map on this question. He preaches
cooperation one day and acts unilaterally the next _ whether the
issue is swatting Saddam Hussein or slapping huge tariffs on
low-cost Japanese steel. Usually, though, he has come down on the
side of power-sharing, either pressing for more arms control
accords even if that means a slow deterioration of the American
nuclear fleet, or granting more power to the World Trade
Organization even if sometimes strikes down American laws.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years battles have gradually gotten more and
more vociferous, as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty showed. Now
it has turned into an open fight, bound to haunt Clinton as he
finishes the last 15 months of his term. It is also certain to
plague his successor in a city where the consensus about U.S.
responsibilities in the world has splintered.
</P>
<P>
   It is a battle in which Clinton has steadily been losing ground.
In his first term he won over moderate Republicans to push through
the North American Free Trade Agreement and the global trade treaty
that created the World Trade Organization. True, these victories
came only after desperate legislative battles, but unlike the test
ban treaty, they were at least fought out in hundreds of hours of
hearings and public debate. But lately, with the exception of the
war in Kosovo, he has been unable to stitch together any kind of
majority for his international initiatives. He was unable even to
convince his own party to vote to give him authority to negotiate
new trade treaties _ a reminder that, for all his denunciations of
isolationism Thursday, most of the economic isolationists in
Congress are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And now, in a treaty that involved national security rather than
economic prosperity, the culmination of an idea whose intellectual
roots go back to Eisenhower Republicans, he became the first
president since Woodrow Wilson to face outright rejection of a
major international accord. The fact that Democrats and Republicans
were unable to agree on the obvious face-saving compromise _ a
delay of the vote until after the presidential election _ seems to
prove that the politics of post-Cold War Washington really are
different. ``It's inconceivable,'' one of Clinton's top advisers
said, ``that this would have been the outcome if the country still
felt under an imminent threat from a major enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many of those who had doubts about the treaty and thus
voted against it would have preferred to see it postponed, amended
or at least fully aired in hearings rather than killed. Moderate
Republicans who voted no like John McCain, a presidential
candidate, were clearly uncomfortable with the message that the
treaty's rejection sent around the world. ``There has always been
an isolationist wing in our party and they were transcendent in the
'20s and '30s,'' McCain said Friday, trying to distance himself
from that group as fast as he could. ``It's still there, it will
always be there, yet I have every confidence that the majority will
take an international viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the instinct in evidence on the Senate floor on
Wednesday night was less about isolationism than about
unilateralism _ preserving America's ability to use its power
unchallenged. In the case of the test ban treaty, that means
retaining an ability to go back to traditional deterrence,
constantly improving America's nuclear arsenal and forcing a
resurgent Russia or an ambitious China to fear a financially
ruinous arms race. After all, the Soviet Union went that route and
bankrupted itself along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Republican party has ever been or is now a
party of isolationism,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, a fellow at the
Council on Foreign Relations. Many of the Republicans who voted
against the treaty, he noted, rank among the Senate's strongest
internationalists. ``But there is a very strong unilateralist
impulse manifesting itself. That's very different. It's not opposed
to foreign entanglements, it just sends a message: `Don't tie our
hands.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued vociferously against that approach during his
press conference Thursday, warning that if an anti-test ban treaty
president ever gets elected (he named no names, but clearly had
George W. Bush Jr. in mind) ``we'll have China testing; we'll have
India testing; we'll have Pakistan testing.'' The result, he
argued, would be a return to an economically destructive arms race.
Sooner or later, he predicted, Republicans would be pressing for
``30 or 40 or 50 billion a year'' in additional defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   He may be right. But it is also possible that the lessons of the
Cold War run deep, and countries now feel far more competitive
pressure than they did a decade ago to invest that money in their
economic well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same moment that Clinton is talking about isolation,
American foreign investment is off the charts, American economic
engagement around the world is breaking all records,'' said Jeffrey
Garten, a former undersecretary of commerce and now dean of the
Yale School of Management. ``In some subtle way, this has
ricocheted back to Washington, and perhaps there are a lot of
people who feel that you can reject an arms control treaty and
still not be withdrawing from the world.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Step outside the United States for even a few days,
and the country has never looked more powerful: An economy that
won't quit, a military that has never faced fewer direct
challenges, a popular and business culture that has become the
world's most eagerly-sought export.
</P>
<P>
   But take one step back into Washington and it's easy to wonder
if you are talking about the same country. The president of the
most powerful nation at its most powerful moment has rarely looked
weaker than he did last week, when the Senate overwhelmingly
defeated the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton responded with an hour-long recitation of the
dangers of a ``new isolationism.'' Republicans shot back that
Clinton had cynically sought to turn a popular but hard-to-enforce
treaty into a political weapon. Bickering along these lines will
doubtless go on for months. But it masks the real debate.
</P>
<P>
   The test ban treaty was only the latest of a number of divisive
issues in the capital that share a common subtext: An argument not
over whether the United States is strong, but over how it should
use its power. Should it strut the global beach alone, or leverage
that power by accepting restraints on its freedom to act?
</P>
<P>
   It is that debate that has eroded the ``vital center'' that
Clinton talks about so often in his laments about the disappearance
of bipartisanship in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself, who has been episodic in focusing on foreign
policy, has ranged all over the map on this question. He preaches
cooperation one day and acts unilaterally the next _ whether the
issue is swatting Saddam Hussein or slapping huge tariffs on
low-cost Japanese steel. Usually, though, he has come down on the
side of power-sharing, either pressing for more arms control
accords even if that means a slow deterioration of the American
nuclear fleet, or granting more power to the World Trade
Organization even if sometimes strikes down American laws.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years battles have gradually gotten more and
more vociferous, as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty showed. Now
it has turned into an open fight, bound to haunt Clinton as he
finishes the last 15 months of his term. It is also certain to
plague his successor in a city where the consensus about U.S.
responsibilities in the world has splintered.
</P>
<P>
   It is a battle in which Clinton has steadily been losing ground.
In his first term he won over moderate Republicans to push through
the North American Free Trade Agreement and the global trade treaty
that created the World Trade Organization. True, these victories
came only after desperate legislative battles, but unlike the test
ban treaty, they were at least fought out in hundreds of hours of
hearings and public debate. But lately, with the exception of the
war in Kosovo, he has been unable to stitch together any kind of
majority for his international initiatives. He was unable even to
convince his own party to vote to give him authority to negotiate
new trade treaties _ a reminder that, for all his denunciations of
isolationism Thursday, most of the economic isolationists in
Congress are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And now, in a treaty that involved national security rather than
economic prosperity, the culmination of an idea whose intellectual
roots go back to Eisenhower Republicans, he became the first
president since Woodrow Wilson to face outright rejection of a
major international accord. The fact that Democrats and Republicans
were unable to agree on the obvious face-saving compromise _ a
delay of the vote until after the presidential election _ seems to
prove that the politics of post-Cold War Washington really are
different. ``It's inconceivable,'' one of Clinton's top advisers
said, ``that this would have been the outcome if the country still
felt under an imminent threat from a major enemy.''
</P>
<P>

voted against it would have preferred to see it postponed, amended
or at least fully aired in hearings rather than killed. Moderate
Republicans who voted no like John McCain, a presidential
candidate, were clearly uncomfortable with the message that the
treaty's rejection sent around the world. ``There has always been
an isolationist wing in our party and they were transcendent in the
'20s and '30s,'' McCain said Friday, trying to distance himself
from that group as fast as he could. ``It's still there, it will
always be there, yet I have every confidence that the majority will

</P>

EDITORIAL: THE POLITICS OF `NO' 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Oct. 17:
</P>
<P>
   One big lesson from the angry fights between President Clinton
and Republican congressional leaders is that they get a thrill from
saying ``no.'' Last week, Senate Republicans thundered ``no'' to
the nuclear test ban treaty, handing the White House its biggest
defeat since health care in 1994. Clinton thundered back with a
``no'' on the Republican schemes to cut taxes and spending, knowing
that his vetoes will be easily sustained. Each side can mount
campaigns, raise money, build support and get everyone excited over
blocking the other side. What is missing, of course, is any
consideration of an electorate that wants the centrists on both
sides to get together and make government work.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996 election, Clinton said he wanted to govern from
the ``vital American center.'' That hope looks now to be in
shambles, although it does not have to be. Indeed, in the last few
weeks, under the cacophony of the partisan collisions over the
budget and nuclear arms, a less-noticed and less-discussed
phenomenon was emerging: the existence of a new center in the House
on regulating health maintenance organizations. A bill that would
allow patients to sue HMOs was approved in the House earlier this
month, with scores of Republicans defying Speaker Dennis Hastert
and supporting a measure put forward by one of the old Democratic
barons, John Dingell, in cooperation with Charlie Norwood, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   As purely a matter of head counts, similar majorities could be
assembled on a range of issues. Most members on both sides of the
aisle do not favor the cuts in Head Start, science research and
education being pushed by Hastert and Tom DeLay in the House. Most
members favor some form of gun-control legislation, which has
already passed with bipartisan support in the Senate. Most favor
raising the minimum wage. Most favor campaign finance reform. The
Republican leadership has allowed the party's right wing to
exercise a veto over these steps, or the right to attach them to
things it knows the Democrats find unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   But two big factors are preventing the consolidation of centrist
majorities drawn from both parties. First is the fact that
Democrats think they have a chance of winning the House and even
the Senate, and Republicans fear the same prospect. Each side is
convinced that confrontation plays better with its core
constituency than compromise. The second big factor is the
poisonous atmosphere at the leadership level. Relations have not
recovered from the impeachment fight, when Clinton felt he was
being pursued and pilloried. Now, the Republican congressional
leaders feel that Clinton is using the arms-control vote to
question their patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   After that vote, the bad vibrations seemed to be spreading. It
is not just the conservative Republicans who say they deeply
distrust and dislike Clinton. Moderates say the same thing.
Correspondingly, there are many Democrats who would think of
election-year confrontations as smart politics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in his news conference last week, Clinton declared that
it would not be that difficult to reach compromises on the budget.
On the merits, he is right. If one could assemble a collection of
moderates from both parties in a room, the differences on many
issues would be far from unbridgeable. It may seem naive to hope
that any kind of practical, cooperating majority can emerge from
the angry fires of partisanship now burning on both sides. But the
public wants Washington to focus on getting to ``yes'' instead of
wallowing in the transitory pleasures of ``no.''

ORIOLES AND TIGERS EMBARRASS THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   During what is supposed to be major-league baseball's showcase
time of the year, some of its member teams cannot seem to do enough
to embarrass themselves. The Detroit Tigers and the Baltimore
Orioles have produced the most blatant cases of embarrassing
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers just hired a new manager, except they did it before
they told the old manager he was fired. And in hiring the new
manager, they thumbed their noses at Commissioner Bud Selig and his
efforts to induce clubs at least to consider members of minorities
for decision-making positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles recently fired their manager and general manager.
The first move had been expected since the early days of the
season; the second was not unexpected either. But the Orioles
executed the second in shameless fashion, issuing a news release
that should be exhibited in the Hall of Fame for its sheer
mean-spiritedness, not to mention the way it makes the people who
made the decision look foolish.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles' management exacerbated its embarrassing behavior by
invoking the name of Cal Ripken, creating an unwarranted link
between the Orioles' living legend and General Manager Frank Wren's
dismissal. Ripken was not pleased that an incident involving him _
Wren would apparently not hold a chartered flight for Ripken, who
was stuck in traffic _ was used as one of the reasons for firing
Wren and accounted for 48 percent of the news release.
</P>
<P>
   The behavior of both the Orioles and the Tigers approximated the
level of play their teams displayed this season. Well, in the
Orioles' case, make that their level of play without the benefit of
their misleading 13-game winning streak last month.
</P>
<P>
   In Phil Garner, the Tigers have their third manager in less than
14 months, and they did not play for five of those months. It is
unfortunate that Garner's hiring has to be muddied by the Tigers'
ill-advised treatment of Larry Parrish, the fired manager, because
he is an excellent choice. They acknowledged that by giving him
$1.2 million a year for four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Brewers, in fact, might wonder if they made the
right decision in firing Garner as their manager. He has been one
of the two most desired managerial candidates _ Don Baylor is the
other _ since the season ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers blamed the news media for reporting their decision to
hire Garner before they were ready to announce it and before they
told Parrish that he was fired. But all that does is confirm that
they had decided to hire Garner before informing Parrish that he no
longer was the manager. They called Parrish at 1 p.m., Eastern
time, last Thursday; the news conference, with Garner present, was
at 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Club officials, in fact, had not talked with Parrish since the
end of the season. ``I told him at the end of the season if he had
any questions, feel free to call,'' General Manager Randy Smith
said. But when Buddy Bell asked questions of Detroit management
late in the 1998 season to try to determine his status as manager,
he was fired, and Parrish was hired.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers interviewed no candidate besides Garner. They ignored
the directive Selig issued to clubs last April telling them that
when they had a vacancy in a decision-making position, they had to
inform him and let him know which minority candidates they planned
to interview. The Tigers informed Selig of nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a legal obligation to adhere to any directives
from the commissioner's office,'' John McHale Jr., the club
president, said. He may have a different view when he receives the
bill from Selig, the one telling him the size of the Tigers' fine.
(It is expected to be between $249,000 and $251,000.)
</P>
<P>
   Teams usually aren't fined for boorishness, which is why the
Orioles will not receive a similar bill from Selig, although he
might send them one for making him decide whether they must pay the
remainder of Wren's contract. Bill or not, someone should make a
wake-up call to them.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner, bristles when he is compared
with George Steinbrenner, but he has out-Steinbrennered the Yankee
owner, and how many pennants or World Series have the Orioles won
lately?
</P>
<P>
   Angelos has owned the team for six years. In Steinbrenner's
first six seasons, the Yankees won three pennants and two World
Series. All Angelos has to show for his half-dozen years is four
managers and three general managers, about to become five and four.
The Orioles have also spent a lot of money on player salaries, with
disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   But they fired Frank Wren, they said, because of the Ripken
chartered flight foul-up, and because Wren refused to apologize to
another club official for a derogatory assessment he had privately
expressed of the official.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner has fired many managers and general managers in his
time, but he never spoke in a mean-spirited way of them when he did
so. On the contrary, he often wound up adding years to their
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles' dismissal of Wren was reminiscent of the departure
three seasons ago of Jon Miller, the team's highly regarded
television announcer. They could not just let Miller go; they went
out of their way to disparage him.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orioles will discover there is a price to pay for their
treatment of Wren and the inherent insecurity in their positions of
general manager and manager. People who would be good candidates
for both jobs have privately said they will not accept interviews
if asked and will not take the jobs if offered.
</P>

   PITCHING FAILS INDIANS
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassment has struck on the field. The guilty parties here
are the Cleveland Indians and the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, during the season, scored the most runs any team
has scored in the second half of the century. A casual observer
could not be blamed for thinking a team with that potent an offense
might bolster its pitching staff to ensure that the hitters'
efforts would not be wasted.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the last two games of their playoff series against
Boston, the Indians eclipsed their average runs per game from the
season. But they lost both games because their pitchers allowed a
total of 35 runs.
</P>
<P>
   In the final five weeks of the season, the Red Sox played the
three teams that finished with the highest earned run averages in
the league. They scored 30 runs against Detroit in three games, 18
against Anaheim in three and 17 against Seattle in four.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Hargrove, who was fired Friday, was made the
scapegoat for the Indians' failure to win a World Series the last
five division-winning years. He reasonably could be accused of
being a co-conspirator because he made some questionable decisions
in playoff games in this postseason and others.
</P>
<P>
   But the front office, diligently as it tried, never delivered
the No. 1 starting pitcher the staff needed, this season or any
other. Had the Indians won the fifth game with Boston and advanced
to the League Championship Series against the Yankees, they would
have to have started Dwight Gooden, Mark Langston or Chris Haney.
The major-league pitching pool is impoverished, but Gooden,
Langston or Haney?
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, too, wielded a set of potent bats this season,
finishing second to the Indians in runs scored. Last year they also
were second. Like last year, in three playoff games against the
Yankees, they scored a total of one run.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have the league's strongest set of starting
pitchers, but their names are not Walter, Christy, Catfish and
Nolan. Yet the Rangers were able to score only one run. Just as he
did last year, Juan Gonzalez scored the lone run in the second
game, meaning the Rangers were shut out in the first and third
games.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago the Rangers batted .141 against the Yankees, this
year .152. With progress like that, the Rangers should be an
offensive juggernaut in next year's opening round against the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   WANTED: 6 MANAGERS
</P>
<P>
   The number of managerial vacancies grows. Six teams are looking.
Some even are looking at candidates who are black. If a black
candidate is actually hired, he will double the number of minority
managers named in the last seven years, a period during which clubs
have hired 38 managers, not including interim managers.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Don Baylor decides to stay with Atlanta as a coach, and
perhaps manager-in-waiting, he is certain to be hired. The
Milwaukee Brewers want him, but he has resisted their courtship.
The Chicago Cubs also have made him an offer. He has not refused
it, but he has not accepted it either.
</P>
<P>
   To show how smart the Colorado Rockies are, they fired Baylor a
year ago and gave Jim Leyland $2 million a year to replace him.
Leyland brought his coterie of coaches with him and got them
multiyear contracts. Now Leyland has quit so he can stay at home
with his family, and the Rockies are stuck with the coaches and
their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies are one of two teams that have recently hired new
general managers (both white). Three openings remain to be filled.
Bob Watson, the former general manager of the Yankees and the
Houston Astros, is expected to get the Anaheim job. No black or
Hispanic has been named a general manager since Watson left the
Yankees 20 months ago, meaning there is none on the job.
</P>
<P>
   A DECLINE IN POWER
</P>
<P>
   As their home runs dropped, so did their batting averages, for
the most part. A decline in one went hand-in-hand with a decline in
the other for three of the top home-run hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire slipped from his record 70 home runs to 65, and his
batting average dropped from .299 to .278. Sammy Sosa slid from 66
to 63 and .308 to .288. Greg Vaughn fell from 50 to 45 and .272 to
.245. Ken Griffey Jr. just barely escaped the double drop. His home
run output fell from 56 to 48, but he raised his batting average by
a whole point, .284 to .285.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Oct. 17:
</P>
<P>
   Last week was one of tragedy for the United Nations. On Monday,
Valentin Krumov, a Bulgarian, was mobbed and then shot by ethnic
Albanians on his first day working for the U.N. mission in Kosovo,
apparently after being mistaken for a Serb. The next day in
Burundi, Luis Zuniga, a Chilean who was the Unicef representative
there, and Saskia von Meijenfeldt, a Dutch employee of the World
Food Program, were murdered. Their equipment was stolen and they
were executed by Hutu rebels upon entering a refugee camp to
evaluate conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Such deaths are not unusual. Since 1992, 180 civilian U.N.
employees have been murdered on the job in such places as Rwanda,
Afghanistan, Tajikistan, East Timor, Sudan and Angola. About 60
percent were people hired locally. Eighty more people are detained
without charges or missing. It is riskier to be a civilian working
for a U.N. observer mission or humanitarian program for food,
children's health or refugee protection than to be an armed U.N.
peacekeeper. The United Nations, in fact, sends civilians into
dozens of danger zones to which its members will not send
peacekeepers, in part for fear of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Given the human calamity that so often accompanies conflict, the
United Nation's civilians must continue to risk their lives to save
those of countless others. But it is inexcusable that U.N. member
nations have refused to pay for the security or training that would
give these workers adequate protection.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll began to rise in 1992 because the nature of
conflict altered sharply. Wars used to be fought mainly between
states whose patrons _ the United States or Soviet Union _ had an
interest in respecting the United Nations. With the Cold War's end,
conflicts are increasingly internal ethnic struggles that target
civilians. Many warlords and clan leaders today consider
international organizations part of the enemy, or see them as
little more than suppliers of easily stolen trucks or food. Some
groups also believe that killing or kidnapping foreigners is the
most effective way to draw attention to their cause _ and the
United Nations is often the only foreign presence.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has 188 duty stations around the globe. Its
security office has a staff of 40 _ the State Department, by
contrast, has 311 _ and 45 or so more people fly in and out for
U.N. agencies, such as the refugee protection office. The United
Nations hires local guards around the world, but all are unarmed.
Staff members in dangerous places are supposed to be trained to
protect themselves. But in practice, the United Nations says it has
too few security experts to provide thorough training.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been asking for donations to
improve security, so far with little result. Four nations have
contributed minor amounts, ranging from a $500 gift from Senegal to
a $1 million donation from Japan. Instead of paying for better
security, U.N. members regularly pass resolutions ``strongly
condemning'' the attacks. These words offer little protection for
the food, refugee and health workers who do the real work and
experience real peril.

ANALYSIS: NUCLEAR TREATY FAILURE COULD HURT CLINTON'S AUTHORITY
ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs for replacement of 3rd graf. No other changes.)  (js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The humbling of the White House over the nuclear
test ban treaty augurs poorly for President Clinton's securing any
crowning foreign policy achievement in the last year of his term.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was so severe that some administration and
congressional officials wondered if it would prematurely dent
Clinton's authority on foreign affairs at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Without a Soviet threat looming abroad, complex and expensive
issues of national security are coming under closer scrutiny from
members of Congress who might prefer to spend the dollars
elsewhere, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it doubly incumbent on the administration to combine
foresight with detailed strategy and hard work to achieve its
foreign policy goals. The White House displayed none of this acumen
in the run-up to the vote on the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the administration ostensibly made any sustained
preparations for realizing other foreign policy goals still
cherished by the president: a comprehensive Middle East peace
settlement that will require tens of billions of dollars in U.S.
and European assistance or welcoming China into the world's major
trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, planning of laser precision helped win the slim
portfolio of foreign policy victories that may end up being
Clinton's lasting legacy in this field _ the expansion of NATO and
the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   To win congressional approval for admitting three former Soviet
bloc countries into NATO, the White House waged a year-long
campaign, pulling together an influential bipartisan congressional
group as a beachhead and wooing lawmakers with dozens of classified
briefings. Similarly, with the free trade agreement, the White
House _ which started out way behind in all the vote tallies _
worked the Congress diligently, with all the care usually accorded
voters in an early presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, say veterans of Washington foreign policy battles,
Clinton was severely handicapped this time around by his poisonous
relations with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't impeach him on Monica, they impeached him on the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,'' said Leslie Gelb, president of the
Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Gelb was an assistant secretary of state in the Carter
administration and worked on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty,
known as SALT. Even with reasonable relations with the Congress, he
said, the Clinton White House needed to start a year ago to help
lawmakers understand the intricacies of the test ban treaty. Back
in 1977, he recalled, more than two years of heavy lobbying on
Capitol Hill was not sufficient to convince Congress of the need
for SALT, and the vote on the Carter-era treaty was eventually
delayed until the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to give billions of dollars to foreigners and make
treaties that limit our military _ it takes a lot of work and
education,'' said Gelb. ``Unless people on the Hill can figure out
how they can sell these proposals to their constituents, they are
not going to vote for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran of foreign policy fights, Thomas A. Dine, a
former executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee, said the White House had shown ``arrogance'' in not
preparing the Senate better for the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The highly partisan atmosphere in Congress had much to do with
the defeat, but so did the White House's failure to fight with more
determination, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a situation before where presidential
prerogative hasn't mattered,'' said Dine, who is now president of
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Democrats and Republicans painted a forlorn
picture of what lies ahead for Clinton's foreign policy goals. His
standing has been diminished abroad, as well as in Congress, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   He is not helped, they added, by a scarred foreign policy team.
The national security adviser, Sandy Berger, was unable to fend off
the Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott on last week's
treaty vote. And Secretary of State Madeleine Albright contributed
what was described in Congress as an unimpressive last-minute
lobbying effort.
</P>
<P>
   On China, Democrats in Congress are complaining of timid
leadership by a White House apparently fearful of domestic
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that Clinton would have a tough time getting
anywhere near the money he promised to the Israelis and
Palestinians for last year's Middle East peace agreement at Wye,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of his second term, Clinton said a ``strategic
partnership'' with China was a priority. Part of the strategy was
to bring China into the World Trade Organization. But Clinton
botched this by turning down an offer in April from Chinese Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji. White House staff said that Zhu's offer to
ease China's trade restrictions would not have passed muster in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate aides said that a bipartisan whip count at the time
of Zhu's visit showed that 56 senators of 87 polled were in favor
of Zhu's proposal. Prospects in the House were then also fair,
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the chance of mustering votes for permanent trading status
for China _ which must accompany its entry into the World Trade
Organization _ has evaporated, legislative staff said.
</P>
<P>
   The battered relationship with China is threatened by a
legislative initiative known as the Taiwan Security Enhancement
Act, which calls for increased military assistance to Taiwan. China
vehemently opposes the proposal, and has said its passage would be
close to intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the bill is gathering surprising steam, the White
House has refused to lobby against it, a Demoocratic aide said.
``They haven't lobbied because they don't want to be put in the
position of appearing to favor China,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The prize that Clinton most covets _ a White House ceremony
sealing the end of the Middle East conflict with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shaking
hands _ looks distant. His ultimate dream is to include the Syrian
leader, Hafiz Assad, as well.
</P>
<P>
   But Assad is being more recalcitrant than expected, and Israel's
demands for U.S. funds for security needs in the event of a
withdrawal from the Golan Heights are probably more than the
Congress could bear. Overall, the comprehensive Middle East peace
agreement that Barak says he wants by next September would cost
tens of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the administration is not having any luck in budging the
Congress to agree to the $1.2 billion promised to the Israelis and
the $400,000 pledged to the Palestinians last year at Wye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year is going to be very difficult to do anything on
foreign policy that doesn't require congressional action,'' Gelb
said. ``Most things need congressional action and money.''

Los Angeles: Norwegian and Italian. With large projects like MiniMed's, the Santa Monica, Calif.,
office of Princeton, N.J.-based Berlitz GlobalNET -- MiniMed's
partner on the project -- tends to go to its offices abroad.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The manual, which took about a month to complete, went on a
whirlwind tour of the globe, with the French portion of the project
alone going from Sylmar to Santa Monica to Paris and then out to
translators and editors in France, then back to Santa Monica and
Sylmar, then back to France for further refinement and finally back
to the client.
</P>
<P>
   Other portions of the MiniMed project were routed through
Berlitz's bureaus in Rome; Sindelfingen, Germany; Madrid, Spain;
Bergen, Norway; and Amsterdam in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   In translation, it is a cardinal rule that a translator be a
native speaker of the target language. In other words, a translator
for a project from English to Mandarin Chinese should be a native
speaker of Mandarin, not English.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with translation by a nonnative speaker,'' said
Monica Matulich, company spokeswoman for Cyrsh Technologies
Corporation, a Woodland Hills-based translation software developer,
``is that they translate according to the way they learned the
language in school, which is not necessarily the colloquial or best
usage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've only learned it as a second language, no matter what
your proficiency level, there's going to be room for error. It's
often a question of the book vs. the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation software, like Cyrsh's, may be suitable for some
types of translations, but the technology has historically been
riddled with problems.
</P>
<P>
   With a sentence like ``Inspect the filter for wear and tear,''
the computer might translate it to mean you should inspect the
filter for wear and then (ITAL) tear (END ITAL) it.
</P>
<P>
   Matulich says Cyrsh Technologies has overcome those problems.
</P>
<P>
   Its system, she said, is different in that it translates not
word for word but based on context and is 100 percent tolerant of
typographical errors and spelling mistakes. The company says its
system can search, retrieve and translate text to and from 28
languages.
</P>
<P>
   By the first quarter of next year, the company expects to have
its first module available. It will allow users to send e-mail in
their native languages and recipients to receive and read it in the
language of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Liller, national accounts manager for Thousand
Oaks-based translation firm Network Omni, is skeptical of the
technology. Network Omni uses human translators for all levels of
translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the term `hydrostatic transmission,' '' said Liller.
``You could translate the term into a hundred languages. Whatever
you store in the computer will be accurate. But in the context of a
phrase, the syntax will often be wrong. You could end up with a
sentence like, `This car a hydrostatic transmission equipped is
with.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have two or three pages of text like this, it will read
like one of those glove compartment manuals that Toyota came out
with decades ago,'' said Liller, who handles translation and
interpreting for clients like Disney, Warner Bros., Hertz and Blue
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the area of advertising,'' Liller said, ``how can a
computer ever begin to understand a phrase like `The Big Apple goes
bananas'? It's going to be a lot easier to translate from scratch
using old-fashioned elbow grease.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing translation companies do agree on is the need to
assemble client-specific glossaries. Large accounts get their own
word lists for consistency's sake. If, for example, the term
``repetition cycle'' appears in one version of a manufacturer's
product, it must appear in all subsequent versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been preaching this for 20 years,'' Liller said. ``The
more you know about a certain industry, the more knowledgeable you
become about its specific terms. It's important to develop a
business glossary before you start the translation project. You
want the accuracy, and you want the client to approve the terms. A
client may feed you 200 phrases that are common in their industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the translator has the accurate terminology, he or she
has the basics to begin a quality translation.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of the translator having expertise in
a given field, beyond a mere proficiency in two or more languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a good translator in one area is important. All
translators should have an expertise,'' Baugham said. ``You may
speak a language. I know English; I grew up here. But I may not
know engineering terminology in English.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best of intentions, gaffes occur. Liller said one of
his favorite gaffes was for the advertising tag line ``Pepsi Comes
Alive.''
</P>
<P>
   It was mistakenly translated in China as ``Pepsi comes out of
the grave.''

BEHIND-THE-SCENES FIRMS KEEP GLOBAL BUSINESS SPEAKING SAME
LANGUAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Somewhere near Paris, a French-speaking
translator with an expertise in medical technology awaits a
project.
</P>
<P>
   Seven thousand miles away, in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, the
marketing department of a medical device manufacturer decides it is
time to have a 28,000-word user's manual translated into a
half-dozen languages, one of which is French.
</P>
<P>
   The two are brought together by a New Jersey-based company with
an expertise in project management, product localization and
translation software, and a long list of worldwide offices.
</P>
<P>
   As telecommunications advances connect the global marketplace,
companies that can successfully market their products to individual
foreign cultures should prosper. Behind this global expansion, the
language services sector plays a hidden, yet crucial, role that is
growing as quickly as the world is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Translation is absolutely vital to international trade,'' said
Vance Baugham, vice president of trade development for the World
Trade Center Association of Los Angeles-Long Beach. ``Good
translation expresses the idea and is sensitive to the nuances of a
foreign culture and its customs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the advent of the Internet, English has become more
prevalent. But when it comes to the bottom line, translation and
interpreting become a key component.''
</P>
<P>
   To define a few terms: ``translation'' is most commonly used to
signify adaptations of the written word, ``interpreting'' denotes
verbal interactions, while ``localizing'' means changing text and
marketing approach with an emphasis not only on language but on the
target culture itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like everyone is endeavoring to reverse the Tower
of Babel,'' said Baugham, who is also trade manager for the Port of
Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley Trade Office. ``Languages can
facilitate communication, but they can also cause an extraordinary
amount of confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined market worldwide for commercial translation, which
includes such diverse services as written translation, multimedia
adaptation, interpreting, translation software development and
language training, is estimated between $8 billion and $10 billion
with a 20 percent annual growth rate. The dollar value for
English-Japanese translation alone is thought to be well over $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But those figures may be low.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rubric `business translation,' '' said San Pedro-based
business and technology translator Stephen Franke, ``is hard to
quantify as a separate, stand-alone cost. Firms tend to include
translation costs in their marketing and advertising budgets,''
making it hard to break out exact numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Angeles region's $181 billion in international trade,
language services play no less a part, with its No. 1 and No. 2
trade partners being Japan and China respectively. Every piece of
software, industrial machinery, every replacement part, catalog,
repair guide, entertainment video and point-of-purchase display,
every marketing plan, bid description and annual report will
involve some degree of adaptation if it is to be targeted to a
foreign market.
</P>
<P>
   But the translation and localization industry, according to a
report by the international marketing research firm Ovum, is highly
fragmented, with no player holding more than 1 percent of the
market worldwide. According to conservative estimates, there are
about 20,000 translation companies, agencies and service providers
in the United States, including free-lancers.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the medical device maker, MiniMed Inc. of Sylmar,
Calif., the target languages for its insulin pump's manual were
Spanish, German, French, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian and Italian.

SAUDI FLAG FAUX PAS TOPS MARKETING BLUNDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When cross-cultural gaffes are discussed in
corporate boardrooms, few come up as frequently as one leading up
to the World Cup of Soccer in Los Angeles in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred when McDonald's and Coca-Cola decided to reprint the
flags of each of the 24 countries that had qualified for the
tournament _ soccer's great quadrennial spectacle _ on pieces of
throwaway packaging.
</P>
<P>
   The hitch: The green-and-white Saudi flag contains the Koran's
sacred passage, ``There is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is his
Prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslims in Spain, where the Coke cans first appeared, and those
in Britain, where McDonald's first released the carryout bags
bearing the sacred passage, were outraged.
</P>
<P>
   It was bad enough, said Muslim leaders, that the holy
inscription was being used to sell drinks and hamburgers. But that
the image was then crumpled up and thrown away was intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Saudi flag contains the Muslim Shahada (the Islamic
declaration of faith), the Saudi government !ital!never!off! allows
its use for commercial or promotional activities, or in any way
that is not consistent with the respect due to the Shahada,'' said
a statement released by the Saudi government at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of expediency winning out over proper planning,
said William Axtell, author of ``Do's and Taboos of Using English
Around the World'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons), was General Motor's snafu
in Belgium, when the automotive giant translated the marketing
tagline ``Body by Fisher'' into Flemish to mean ``Corpse by
Fisher.''
</P>
<P>
   Other gaffes have occurred when names !ital!weren't!off!
translated.
</P>
<P>
   ``A telephone system known as Chat Box became, in French, the
!ital!Cat!off! Box (since !ital!chat!off! is the French word for
cat),'' said Axtell, a former vice president for worldwide
marketing at the Parker Pen Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parker Pen's well-known Jotter ballpoint pen could not be
marketed with the name in Latin countries because that word also
happened to be slang for jockstrap.''

   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ If Michael Graney has his way, this
perennial second city will be looking for a band of young men to
banish its chronic inferiority complex and improve the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Their job: throwing, catching and hitting for a still unnamed
minor-league expansion team in an as-yet-unbuilt $21.3 million
stadium called Peter Pan Park.
</P>
<P>
   But some in this industrial city long overshadowed by Boston say
the plan will not work, and a referendum to stop the project is
gaining support.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposal just doesn't make sense,'' said Richard
Stebbins, a leading opponent of the 5,300-seat stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a travesty to mortgage some of our economic future for a
facility that will be used about 200 hours a year,'' said Stebbins,
a retired banker.
</P>
<P>
   Cities across the nation are struggling with the question of
whether new sports complexes will be economic boons or boondoggles.
In this decade, 46 major league stadiums and arenas have been built
or renovated for teams in the four principal professional sports
leagues, and 49 more are under construction or in the planning
stages, said Andrew Zimbalist, sports economist at Smith College,
about 20 miles north of Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   The cost/benefit analysis goes beyond the bottom line, with
civic pride and family entertainment all fitting into the mix. But
the question often boils down to who will pay for the
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Even when governments pay, there are no guarantees, as Hartford,
Conn., learned this spring. The Connecticut Legislature agreed to
pay for a new $375 million stadium after the New England Patriots
said it would move to Hartford, 26 miles downriver from
Springfield. But when the football team received another offer from
Massachusetts, it decided to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   Cities that want to get in on a boom in minor league baseball
face similar issues. In the case of Springfield, the city is
putting up $2 million and the state has promised $4 million in
transportation and economic development grants to get the site
ready for a team from the Northern League, which is not affiliated
with Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Graney, president of the nonprofit Springfield Baseball Corp.,
which would own the team, says the mostly private financing sources
his group assembled insulate taxpayers from risk.
</P>
<P>
   But Stebbins said debt service on bonds and loans alone would
exceed revenue even if optimistic attendance figures of 4,200 per
game held, ensuring that the city would never attract a quality
ball club to its stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The grants promised by the state would come at the expense of
potentially more productive projects, Stebbins said.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council recently voted 6-3 to use eminent domain to
take the proposed site for the stadium, a shopping center in the
shadow of two interstate highways. But a group called Citizens
Action Network is mounting a petition drive to force a referendum
to block the project, and the seizure is being fought by some
merchants and the owners of the shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth effort in five years to find a minor league
team for Springfield, which had professional baseball on and off
from 1902 until its ballpark burned down in 1965. In 1995 a deal
was all but done with a group of investors who had bought
Pennsylvania's Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League for $4.1
million. When Harrisburg officials heard of the deal, they
complained to the league and were able, at the last minute, to buy
the club for $6.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been to the altar many times,'' said Andrew Linker, a
sportswriter for The Harrisburg Patriot-News, an observer of
Springfield's travails.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Stebbins said, the city's power brokers ``have fallen
in love with the allure of baseball.'' He added that the stadium
was destined to become a white elephant, an assessment shared by
Zimbalist.
</P>
<P>
   New stadiums, whether for the minor or major leagues, are never
sound investments, Zimbalist said, and the Springfield plan is
especially ill-conceived because almost a quarter of the proposed
budget is for seizing property and relocating 16 businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Graney contends that the stadium will increase traffic for local
businesses as part of a broad revitalization effort that includes
expanding the Basketball Hall of Fame, building a new convention
center and reviving two downtown theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The team will give the city a ``psychological boost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium, planned to open in 2001, is supported by the mayor
and a majority of the City Council. It is being designed by HOK
Sports Facilities Group, responsible for high-profile projects like
Camden Yards in Baltimore and the proposed new Fenway Park in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   One supporter, Peter Picknelly Sr., owns the Peter Pan Bus
Lines, a long-distance service based in Springfield. He has
promised a $3 million donation of his own money to the project, and
his company is buying naming rights for $1 million more.
</P>
<P>
   Picknelly's father named what was then a jitney company with two
vehicles for his son 65 years ago. His mother was reading the story
of Peter Pan to the 3-year-old Peter, and his parents decided he
resembled the fabled boy who refused to grow up.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Irene is expected to weaken to a tropical storm later
Sunday. Torrential rain, however, will fall near and to the north
of the center of the storm as it approaches the Carolina coast. The
heaviest rain during the day will be from the eastern Carolinas to
southeastern Virginia, including some of the areas hardest hit by
the flooding from Hurricane Floyd last month. Winds in the interior
Carolinas will average 20 mph to 35 mph. Many coastal areas will
have wind gusts over 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and a few showers will develop near the east slopes of
the central Appalachians as moist winds from the southeast ascend
the sloping terrain. The day will begin with sun near the Northeast
Coast, but clouds and showers will form Sunday afternoon from
western Pennsylvania to near the southern New England coast as
humid air from the south encroaches.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front with limited moisture will gradually move east
through eastern parts of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley as well as
the lower Mississippi Valley Sunday. A band of clouds and scattered
showers will occur near the front. In the wake of the front, most
of the Plains states will be breezy and unseasonably cool. A
mixture of rain and snow showers will occur near Lake Superior as
colder air passes over the milder water. Farther south, patchy rain
and high-elevation snow will occur in northwestern Texas and New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The West will be sunny as high pressure builds. Strong wind
gusts will occur near many mountain passes from California to the
southern Rockies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HOSTILE TERRITORY
</P>
<P>
   When hurricanes emerge from the tropics in October, they are
entering hostile territory. To maintain their strength, hurricanes
need warm ocean water beneath them and relatively light winds above
them. Hurricanes derive energy by causing water vapor to condense
and release heat as the warm, moist air near the ocean surface is
forced to rise in the tall thunderstorms surrounding the storm's
center. Strong winds aloft can tear the storms apart. October is
hostile to hurricanes because mid-latitude ocean temperatures are
cooling while high-level jet stream winds are growing stronger.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: PAKISTAN'S DANGEROUS ADDICTION TO ITS
MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN R. WEISMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is always tempting to see Pakistan as an artificial country
carved painfully out of the remnants of the British empire, a place
of such virulent sectarian hatreds and corrupt leadership that only
the military can hope to govern it successfully. That view has
returned now that Pakistan has suffered its fourth military coup in
52 turbulent years as a nation. Even some Pakistanis who believe in
democracy but were opposed to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif welcomed
military intervention to change regimes.
</P>
<P>
   But if a country is unruly, having generals rule is no solution.
Pakistan's last military regime, which lasted from 1977 to 1988,
was a useful ally, particularly in opposing the Russians in
neighboring Afghanistan. But by crushing dissent, tolerating
corruption and having no accountability for 11 years, the military
lost credibility among Pakistanis and was eventually overwhelmed by
the nation's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Pakistan's generals got the disastrous idea of
sending forces into Indian territory to occupy the mountains of the
disputed state of Kashmir. Indian guns and planes were driving the
intruders out, and under American pressure Sharif wisely agreed to
arrange for a face-saving withdrawal. Now the generals, unhappy
with Sharif's retreat, have seized power, suspended the
Constitution and imposed martial law, despite the absence of any
threats of turmoil in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what might have happened in Kashmir had Sharif's
withdrawal agreement not prevailed. The military might well have
retaliated by bombing India's artillery positions, a step that
probably would have forced Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee to listen to his generals and invade Pakistan. These
escalations could very easily have spiraled into a nuclear
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   As a nation, Pakistan always had a shaky foundation. Its name,
which means ``land of the pure,'' is drawn from some of its
constituent ethnic groups. The Bengalis of East Pakistan broke off
in 1971 to become Bangladesh, and the other groups have been
squabbling since. Islam is not the unifying ideology that
Pakistan's founders hoped it could be.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that the original building blocks of Pakistani
society _ the clergy, the military and the wealthy feudal lords who
owned most of the land _ have fractured. Today the military is
split into secular and Islamic camps. The landlords' power has
flowed to a newly wealthy business class represented by Sharif. The
clergy is split into factions, some of which are allied with Saudi
Arabia, Iran, the terrorist Osama bin Laden, the Taliban in
Afghanistan and others. Breakaway ethnic movements flourish.
Corruption, poverty, guns and drugs have turned these elements into
an explosive mix.
</P>
<P>
   To revive the idea of religion as the glue holding the country
together, Pakistani leaders have promised many times to enforce
Islamic law. But they have never been able to implement these
promises because most Pakistanis are not doctrinaire in their
approach to religion. Alternatively, the nation's leaders have
seized on the jihad to ``liberate'' fellow Muslims in Kashmir,
India's only Muslim-dominated state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pakistani army generals are trying to convince themselves
that defeat in Kashmir was snatched from the jaws of victory by
Sharif and his stupid diplomats,'' said Michael Krepon, president
of the Henry L. Stimson Center. ``This theory recurs in Pakistani
history, and it is very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   In his address to the nation, Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, the army
chief of staff who ``dismissed'' Sharif, spoke of the military as
``the last remaining viable institution'' of Pakistan. But by
imposing martial law, he has embarked on a well-trod Pakistani path
toward ruining that reputation. Without question, Sharif blundered
in cracking down on dissent, trying to dismiss Musharraf and
relying on cronies and family members for advice. Some Indians like
the writer M.J. Akbar, editor of The Asian Age, say that it might
be easier to make a deal with Pakistan's generals now that they are
overtly in charge, rather than manipulating things behind the
scenes. But a major reason Pakistan has such a stunted political
tradition, compared with India, is that the army has run the
country for nearly half its short history. The question remains: If
Pakistanis are not capable of governing themselves, why would
Pakistanis wearing uniforms be any different?

OUTDOORS: PLACID SKY BELIES A WATERY JUNGLE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. _ Soon after we left Montauk inlet on an
uncharacteristically balmy autumn morning, bound for the ``back
country'' of Gardiners Bay, our guide, David Blinken, yelled to
make himself heard above the churning outboard engines and the
heavy rush of wind. ``Watch for the monarchs,'' he shouted. ``They
were as thick as rain here, just last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly, a handful of black specks appeared far ahead, scattered
like pepper about eight feet above the gentle swells. Monarch
butterflies may appear strikingly large and gaudy among the tomato
plants and day lilies in the garden. But above the sea, buffeted by
winds for which even their enormous wings are no match, they look
anything but regal. They just look doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming lost at sea is probably as noble a way to go as any,
and enough monarchs must survive the great annual southward
migration to justify their heroic flight over vast expanses of
water. Here they were a reminder that although we tend to regard
fall as a time of closure, in nature it is more notable as a time
of brute and sweeping movements, from hurricanes to the migrations
of caribou and woodcock and even delicate monarch butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   But the fish were what we were after. From early September
through mid-November, vast schools of fish, ranging from baitfish
no larger than sewing needles to rapacious bluefish, mercurial
false albacore and stout striped bass congregate in large masses
near Montauk on the eastern tip of Long Island, around which every
species seeking warmer or more forage-rich water must make a tight
turn as it heads south. This leads to fish gridlock, and to seas
marked with dark rafts of massed baitfish that run red when the big
predators go on the feed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got albies,'' Blinken cried, about three hours after we
began looking for fish in a small bay called Tobacco Lot. He cut
the throttle on the Allegra, a 23-foot center-console Contender.
All three of Blinken's boats are named after his only daughter,
Allegra, a 6-year-old, suggesting that Blinken ought to get more
daughters or fewer boats.
</P>
<P>
   In typical fashion, the false albacore ripped at the baitfish
briefly but fiercely, their olive backs glinting in the sun as the
albies broke the black surface, boiling, slashing and chasing the
bait. By the time Richard Franklin and I cast our flies, the albies
had sounded and all was again still.
</P>
<P>
   We resumed drifting on the tide, under porcelain blue skies and
a sun so warm it felt prickly on our cheekbones. Given my druthers,
I would have chosen howling winds, lashing rain, and large pods of
reckless fish, as we had last year, but that's how fishing is:
something always goes wrong and you just pray it isn't under the
cowl of the motor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three storms in like 10 days,'' Blinken said, while
squinting for a sign of breaking fish on the horizon, ``starting
with Hurricane Floyd. The entire bay is topsy-turvy. The water's
still cloudy and we're not seeing birds working.''
</P>
<P>
   The birds, including Bonaparte gulls, terns, and oystercatchers,
certainly were present. But not a single group of them hung
suspended over a feeding school of fish, squawking and diving for
what they could scavenge from the carnage below.
</P>
<P>
   Water clarity and temperature, along with tidal flows, may be
affected by dramatic changes in the weather, causing the
piscatorial food chain to respond in unpredictable ways, starting
with the locally abundant baitfish.
</P>
<P>
   These include peanut bunker, bay anchovy, silversides, and sand
lance _ a k a sand eel. When the normal ambient pattern is
interrupted, a great submarine game of hide-and-seek ensues. The
bait sometimes gets a welcome break, because life at sea is about
one thing and one thing only: swimming around and eating anything
that doesn't eat you first. It is the ultimate theater for a
realist.
</P>
<P>
   The sun was setting, the air was still, and the boat rocked
gently as we beheld a serene sight: lavender highlights on the
tawny sand cliffs just a 100 yards away. Even the shore birds
merely stood on the littoral, basking. Then the ``rain bait'' _
tiny sea anchovies _ appeared. They moved inexorably toward the
Allegra, dimpling the surface, as the school desperately sought to
escape the bigger fish below. ``Look,'' Blinken said, his blue eyes
widening. ``The albies are driving the bait into the shallows.''
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter was just beginning. The albies sent spumes of
water high in the air as they chased the desperate baitfish. The
flanks of the albacore, fish weighing between five and eight
pounds, glinted mauve in the fading light. The fish moved so
gracefully, so swiftly, that we couldn't begrudge them a thing. For
a saltwater fly-fisher, even a feeding frenzy can be a pretty sight
_ and, as we learned, a productive one as well.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Saltwater fly-fishing is an increasingly popular recreation all
over Long Island, from Memorial Day to Thanksgiving _ or until
prohibitive, freezing temperatures arrive. Guides who specialize in
the sport include Blinken, North Flats Guiding, www.northflats.com;
(516) 324-2860; Paul Dixon, To the Point charters; (516) 324-7979,
and others. Flyfishing specialty shops, including the Manhattan
establishments, the Orvis shop and the Urban Angler, can also refer
you to experienced, licensed guides.

SPORTS COLUMN: DINGERS, DARTS AND OLD-FASHIONED HARDBALL AT FENWAY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Among other baseball novelties, Fenway Park happens to
be the origin of the chant with which Red Sox fans derided their
designated Mets' target in 1986. On a chilly October night, from
around this quaint Boston landmark, came the cries of ``Dar-ryl ...
Dar-ryl.'' The young slugger didn't like the sound of this at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ticked, yeah,'' Strawberry said before the Yankees
strutted into town, leading the American League Championship Series
by 2-0 with Roger Clemens facing Pedro Martinez Saturday in Game 3.
``Then I kind of thought about it over the years. It became kind of
fun. I thought, `If they're going to chant at me, I might as well
thrill 'em.'''
</P>
<P>
   This seemed to be the attitude the Yankees brought with them
from New York, where they won the two games they needed to ease the
urgency, to put them in a position, at least for a day, of rolling
with Fenway's punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the regular season, it's pretty intense,'' Strawberry
said of his previous Yankee visits. ``The playoffs? We're really
going to need a lot of security.''
</P>
<P>
   He said this playfully, almost amused by the thought. The
reality, for the most part, is that it's just good, passionate,
old-fashioned hardball when the Yankees visit the Red Sox. Though
Chris Chambliss could tell Strawberry a more daunting Fenway tale.
</P>
<P>
   Those around the Yankees who were with them during the 1970s _
coaches Chambliss and Willie Randolph specifically _ were besieged
with the Bucky Dent/1978 one-game playoff questions last week,
after the Red Sox finished off Cleveland and headed on to New York.
</P>
<P>
   One day in the Yankee clubhouse, I asked Chambliss if he
remembered another rousing Yankee-Red Sox Fenway showdown, a
one-run, extra-inning battle during the Yankees' surprising run for
the division with the Red Sox and the Orioles in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean the game when Alex Johnson came up and homered to win
it?'' Chambliss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   We take our special memories when they happen to come, and
sometimes they are not from the games that historically matter
most. My fondest Fenway recollection is from a September night 25
years ago, when a few college friends left New York in the
afternoon and pulled into Kenmore Square in time for the second
game of a two-game series, the Yankees tied with the Red Sox for
first place after winning the night before.
</P>
<P>
   We had a good view from the center-field bleachers of Luis Tiant
tantalizing the Yankees hitters with his variety of deliveries,
carrying a 1-0 lead against the New York starter, Pat Dobson, into
the ninth. A one-out walk brought Chambliss to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a ball out into right field that rolled around and I
wound up on third, with the runner scoring,'' Chambliss said. ``But
then the umpire ruled that a fan had interfered with the ball. They
let the run score but motioned me back to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Billy Virdon, the manager, comes out to argue while I'm
still standing on third, next to Dick Howser, the coach. And just
as I turn around, away from Howser to see what's going on out at
second, I feel this pain in my arm, right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss pointed to the area below the armpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look down, and there's a steel dart imbedded in my arm,
right through the shirt,'' he said. ``I looked around and there
were more of them on the field. They came out of the stands behind
third. I thought about it later, and I realized that if I had still
been talking to Howser, I might have gotten hit right in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss paused, and added: ``Maybe you shouldn't write that.
We're liable to have one of those copycat things when we're up
there this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   He was surprised how many details I remembered about that game,
including a diving stop by the Yankee second baseman, Sandy Alomar,
against Cecil Cooper with the winning run steaming around third.
The Yankees held on until Johnson, an enigmatic personality with a
lively bat who had been a late-season acquisition, stepped up
against Diego Segui and slammed the ball into the right-center
bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson trotted rather indifferently around the bases, seemingly
oblivious to the rivalry thing going on and the celebration he had
set off among the small pockets of New York fans around the park.
The Yankees that night were alone in first, at the latest stage in
any season since they had last won a pennant a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles eventually won the division, but that wasn't the
point, nor was the dart that stuck in Chambliss' arm.
</P>
<P>
   It was that the Yankees had gone into Boston needing a victory,
and had left unbeaten, if also a bit bruised.
</P>
<P>
   It was another time they rolled with Fenway's punches, the job
Clemens and the Yankees were in the position Saturday of doing once
more.

IF GIANTS SEEK NEW COACH, IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE SCHOTTENHEIMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Right now, New York Giants coach Jim Fassel is fighting to keep
his reputation as an offensive guru intact. He is fighting to keep
his players from fracturing into a bunch of bickering children. And
it may not be too early to say that Fassel is fighting for his job.
Fassel made it clear this week with a rousing speech to his players
that he has a lot of fight left in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could come in here and lie to you,'' Fassel said, according
to his players. ``But don't you want me to tell you the truth?
Offense is playing bad right now, and the defense is playing well.
But now is not the time to trash each other. If you see somebody
who is down, pick him up. You won't see me with my head low. I'll
stay positive and I want you guys to be positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Fassel moved throughout the large meeting room and asked
several players individually, ``What would you think if I came in
here and said I gave up?'' At first, the players were surprised by
Fassel's directness, but each one answered, and Fassel's speech
evolved into a major emotional moment for the team.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Fassel showed he remains confident he can turn his
team's fortune around, this is a difficult time for him. The Giants
are a disappointing 2-3 and are stumbling into a tough game at home
against the Dallas Cowboys on Monday night. So after a lackluster
8-8 season last year, speculation about Fassel's future is already
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Two possible replacements have emerged in the stern Michigan
State coach, Nick Saban, and in the former Kansas City Chiefs coach
Marty Schottenheimer, a proven winner. Both men are friends of
Giants general manager Ernie Accorsi.
</P>
<P>
   But this week it was learned there is almost no chance that
Schottenheimer will coach the Giants, or any other team, next year.
Why? It would probably cost the Giants a slew of draft picks for
Schottenheimer, currently a National Football League analyst for
ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   When Schottenheimer retired from Kansas City at the end of last
season, he had three years remaining on his contract, which means
that Schottenheimer's rights are still owned by the Chiefs. To hire
Schottenheimer a team must contact Kansas City and receive
permission just to talk to him, and then to get him it would
probably cost the inquiring franchise draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how many, and the answer is maybe a lot. The
precedent was set when Bill Parcells retired from the New England
Patriots and then joined the Jets. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue
ruled that the Patriots were to receive draft picks as compensation
for Parcells; thus New England got selections in the first, second,
third and fourth rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City general manager Carl Petersen said he would expect
similar compensation from any team that wanted Schottenheimer to
coach next season. Schottenheimer never led the Chiefs to three
Super Bowls with two different teams the way Parcells did with the
Giants and Patriots. But in his nine years at Kansas City,
Schottenheimer developed an excellent reputation as a head coach,
earning a 104-65-1 career record. The Chiefs have no intention of
letting Schottenheimer go for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to be punitive,'' Petersen said, ``but he has
a contract with us. When Marty retired I spoke to him about this
and he said he understood.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue would ultimately decide. But Schottenheimer would cost
the Giants at least several high-round selections to acquire his
rights, and giving up draft picks is something the Giants
traditionally hate to do.
</P>
<P>
   Schottenheimer's situation means that Saban must be considered
the top candidate to replace Fassel should the Giants decide to
make a change at the end of the season. Already some personnel
executives say Saban is a good bet to coach in the NFL next year.
The Spartans are ranked fifth in the latest Associated Press poll.
Michigan State's defense gives up just 36.7 yards a game on the
ground, the lowest in the nation, and if it holds, the
second-lowest total in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Saban was almost hired by the Giants after Dan Reeves was fired
two years ago. The first choice of George Young, the former general
manager, was actually Saban over Fassel, but after Saban made
contractual demands the Giants did not like, Young quickly turned
to Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   The next month will determine just how high Saban's stock will
rise. Four of Michigan State's next five games are against top 25
opponents. If Saban can win at least three or four of those games,
his phone will start ringing.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a chance all of this could become a moot point.
Fassel could turn the Giants' fortunes with a victory against
Dallas. That would make the team 3-3. Then the Giants have games
against New Orleans and Philadelphia, two teams playing even worse
than they are. So the Giants could be 5-3 at their bye week Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Then maybe all speculation about Fassel's future would stop.
</P>
<P>
   FANS SHOW A LACK OF CLASS
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the Philadelphia Eagles cheered last week as Michael
Irvin lay on the Veterans Stadium turf, barely able to feel his
arms and legs. As Irvin was carried away on a stretcher, and the
possibility of paralysis loomed, fans cheered even louder.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the lowest points in football this season and it
caused a national outrage. But as bad as it was, there have been
incidents in recent years that have been worse. One of them
involved Giants quarterback Kent Graham.
</P>
<P>
   When Graham was playing with Arizona in 1997, he took a violent
hit to his knee, and as he writhed in pain on the ground, Graham's
own fans at Sun Devil Stadium cheered. They were hoping he was
injured so the rookie Jake Plummer could come into the game.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most infamous horror shows happened at Giants Stadium
three years ago when fans threw ice-packed snowballs at players and
coaches on the sideline. One of those snowballs, which was more
like a brick, knocked a trainer for the Chargers unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   One league executive said that although NFL stadium security is
extremely tight, there is concern that fans are not only becoming
more insensitive, but more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   The fear, the official said, is that a fan might leave the
stands and approach the field with a weapon, and a player could be
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAMS COULD USE TIME TO HEAL
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans running back Ricky Williams has earned respect
inside the Saints' organization for constantly playing through
injuries such as a hyperextended right elbow and a left ankle that
is sprained in two places.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has proved he is tough. The only problem is that he may
never completely heal unless coach Mike Ditka allows Williams to
sit out for at least a week in order to rest his body. That will
probably not happen; Williams is scheduled to start Sunday against
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   What is worse for Williams is his incentive-heavy contract.
Clearly, it was a mistake to sign it, since he will reach few, if
any, of the incentives. Just to reach his $1 million bonus,
Williams must average 111 yards in each of his remaining games. So
far, Williams' statistics have been very ordinary: just 257 yards
rushing and a 3.6-yard per carry average.
</P>
<P>
   To earn his $3 million bonus, Williams must average 154.1 yards
a game. Of course, that has never been done before.

 FASSEL'S X's AND O's TAKE A HIT OFF THE FIELD, TOO  
 (See also FBN-NOTEBOOK, which discusses the prospects for a new
coach . )  
 (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there was one play that symbolized the frustrations of New
York Giants fans over the team's bumbling offense and tedious
play-calling, it would be the pitch and run around left end to
Charles Way on a third-and-2 early in the Giants' dreadful 14-3
loss last week to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   It was precisely the kind of decision that has coach Jim Fassel
besieged, the galvanizing point for criticism even in his own
locker room and organization.
</P>
<P>
   Why send the 250-pound Way rumbling wide on a slow-developing
play seemingly doomed to fail?
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said it was a play that had worked successfully against
the Cardinals in the past. He elaborated at length that it had to
do with the particular defense the Cardinals were playing at the
time and the package of players they had on the field compared with
the players the Giants had on the field.
</P>
<P>
   It was a technical response. It was thoughtful, high strategy.
The Giants' scheme against the Cardinals' scheme.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem. The play's success or failure came
down to wide receiver Joe Jurevicius slicing in from his position
at the end of the formation to block Simeon Rice, the Cardinals'
Pro Bowl defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Jurevicius, a second-year player hardly known for his blocking,
did not deter Rice in the least from tackling Way for no gain.
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants reviewed the film of the play two days later,
Fassel made the point that the mistake by Jurevicius cost the
Giants a first down. Without mentioning Jurevicius, the coach made
the same point to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the matter is whether there is a deep flaw, not
in design, but in a misguided expectation.
</P>
<P>
   An ``x'' on a diagrammed play representing Jurevicius, who has
started one National Football League game, isn't likely to block
the ``o'' on the diagram if it represents the dominating Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The ``x'' representing Way in the diagram cannot by itself show
that Way is hardly fleet of foot and best kept between the tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing your players is every bit as important as knowing your
plays.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares for a pivotal game with the Dallas Cowboys on
Monday night, Fassel _ less than two years removed from a coach of
the year award _ is being scrutinized, with his job on the line,
not for what he knows about offensive football but for whether he
has a feel for the game and its players beyond his scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Or as a rival NFL executive put it recently: ``If he's an
offensive guru, when is he going to start guruing?''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel accepts such second-guessing tactfully, even if he
believes it is overly simplistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things don't go well, people say: `Let's try this. Let's
try that. Let's try him,''' the coach said. ``Pretty soon you're
all over the place and you've got nothing going on. I know my
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm analyzing the problem to see how I'm going to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is so much amiss in the production of his offense, an
attack gone completely haywire.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing defenses find the Giants patently predictable. They are
waiting in holes for running backs and smothering receivers in
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In the way of exotic plays, they have run one of note: a flea
flicker that gained 38 yards. That was not called until the Giants
were down, 21-0. They have played their best in the no-huddle
offense they have needed late in losing games. But unfortunately,
it is not just a matter of throwing more.
</P>
<P>
   In the Giants' lifeless loss to Arizona, they attempted to pass
on 19 of 27 first downs. It did not help. They completed only nine
of those passes.
</P>
<P>
   And even when the Giants' offensive scheming does succeed in
creating mismatches, they do not take advantage of them.
</P>
<P>
   Twice last week, the Giants split running back Gary Brown wide
at the end of the formation. The Cardinals put their best
cornerback, Aeneas Williams, on Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Just what the Giants wanted. That meant a linebacker had to be
on a wide receiver somewhere. The Giants never found the mismatch
and had almost nothing to show for their trickery.
</P>
<P>
   This week, desperate to win, Fassel has vowed to simplify his
offense, hoping for basic production from core plays. This approach
has worked before for Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   It could well work again. But how far can simplicity carry a
team?
</P>
<P>
   True, they can't run until they can walk, but three years into
Fassel's tenure, just when are they going to run?
</P>
<P>
   Working 17-hour days, Fassel continues to examine every angle,
although sometimes his meticulous nature has a way of shutting out
a number of considerations that would seem mainstream, even if they
call for a more fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants style.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, the case of the rookie running back Joe
Montgomery. A second-round pick, Montgomery missed all of training
camp with an injury that has since healed.
</P>
<P>
   But Montgomery can't get on the field. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Fassel has his 45-man roster set, and with some nagging
injuries, he fears he might be caught short on the offensive line
or in the secondary if he sits one backup at those positions _
someone like Jeremy Lincoln or Mike Rosenthal _ to make room for
Montgomery. That depth would not be tested unless there was
additional injury, but Fassel is not willing to take that risk,
even if it means new blood _ and perhaps a spark _ for the league's
26th-ranked offense.
</P>
<P>
   With good, aggressive acceleration and an average of 6.5 yards a
carry last year at Ohio State, it would have been interesting to
see Montgomery with the football on that third-and-2 in the first
quarter last week.
</P>
<P>
   Albeit off tackle.

   MISSOURI: SENATE RACE HITS ALL THE HOT ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to hot-button issues, few election 2000 contests
can boast as many as the U.S. Senate contest in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   First, the death penalty reared up.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came abortion.
</P>
<P>
   And now along comes race.
</P>
<P>
   The contest, in which Gov. Mel Carnahan, a moderate Democrat,
seeks to unseat Sen. John Ashcroft, a Christian-right Republican up
for a second term, looks like a tossup, and its results could be
among the most pivotal in determining control of the Senate.
Exchanges between the two candidates have been appropriately _ and
sometimes inappropriately _ heated.
</P>
<P>
   The first tiff took place back in January, when Carnahan spared
the life of a convicted murderer after receiving a plea for mercy
from Pope John Paul II, who was visiting St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who previously had approved more than two dozen
executions, said that sometimes convicted murderers merited mercy.
Ashcroft, an advocate of the death penalty, accused the governor of
going soft on capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In midsummer, the two men tangled over abortion when the
governor, an advocate of abortion rights, vetoed a law that would
have restricted some rights, a veto that was overridden by the
Legislature. The senator, an abortion opponent, said the governor
was insensitive to the rights of the unborn.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 10 days ago, the two men tangled still again, this time
when Ashcroft helped lead the successful fight against President
Clinton's effort to elevate Judge Ronnie White, the first black
judge to sit on the Missouri Supreme Court, to the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan charged that in leading the fight against White,
Ashcroft had tried to ``destroy a good man's career in order to
further his own.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator countered that his opposition had nothing to do with
politics or race. Rather, he said, he worried that White was soft
on crime and was the kind of judge who would ``reach for
loopholes'' that benefited criminals.
</P>
<P>
   A footnote:
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of the White nomination has led black leaders in
Missouri to vow to make a special effort next year to defeat
Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   The state's black vote, particularly heavy in Kansas City and
St. Louis, was badly splintered in the 1998 Senate election, and
the Republican incumbent, Christopher S. Bond, won re-election with
unexpected ease. But election 2000 will be different, the black
leaders promised last week after three dozen of them gathered in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get angry,'' Emanuel Cleaver, a former Kansas City
mayor, told the gathering. ``Don't get even. Get active.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Kelvin Simmons, a Kansas City councilman, added:
``Thank you, Ashcroft. You just energized a sleeping giant.''
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA: HOMOSEXUALITY ISSUE SPLITS FATHER AND SON
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he was elected to the California state senate in
1992, William J. Knight has been trying to win passage of a law
that would ban state recognition of same-sex marriages. But without
success.
</P>
<P>
   So now Knight, a 69-year-old conservative Republican, is pushing
a statewide initiative that would impose such a ban. It is likely
to be one of the most disputed issues on next year's spring ballot,
one that draws attention from well beyond the state's borders,
along with lots of money and campaign volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when he learned that a San Francisco newspaper was
about to publish an article about sexual orientation within the
Knight family, Knight pre-empted the paper by announcing that his
son, David, was gay and that his own brother, John, was gay and had
just died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who served as an Air Force fighter pilot and as
mayor of Palmdale, just north of Los Angeles, before going to
Sacramento, said that while it was ``hard to deal with'' the fact
that there were two gay men in the Knight family given his feelings
about homosexuality, he nevertheless had come to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   Not true then, nor now, says son David, a 39-year-old
cabinetmaker who lives in Baltimore and who, like his father, is a
former fighter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   As he sees the situation, his father loved him and was proud of
him before learning that he was gay and had a ``life partner.'' But
since that revelation, he says, he has been rejected and his father
has become ardently anti-gay because of ``blind ignorance'' and
because it ``serves his political career.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sometimes bitter, sometimes emotional commentary published
in Thursday's Los Angeles Times, David wrote of his father:
</P>
<P>
   ``His is a blind, uncaring, uninformed, knee-jerk reaction to a
subject about which he knows nothing and wants to know nothing. I
can't begin to explain the hurt that has come from this rejection.
I miss him. But I cannot and will not change the person that I am
and I must speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator issued a statement in which he said he did not feel
the commentary was fair and in any event should not have been used
to air family differences. ``I care deeply about my son,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   HOW MCCAIN PLANS TO DEFEAT BUSH
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona says his plan for capturing the
Republican presidential nomination next year is simple, albeit
difficult to pull off.
</P>
<P>
   Most political pros agree, especially on the latter. But they
are not writing him off _ not yet, not as long as other candidates
keep dropping by the wayside while he keeps chugging forward in the
polls and in raising money and new issues.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's plan calls for him to bypass the first-in-the-nation
caucuses in Iowa on Jan. 24 (he has no campaign organization there)
and concentrate instead on ambushing Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
eight days later, on Feb. 1, in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation
primary.
</P>
<P>
   If he can finish well in New Hampshire, he says, he can then
head for South Carolina, the next big primary state, where on Feb.
19 he hopes the huge population of fellow veterans will help him
build on the New Hampshire momentum, again at Bush's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's on to Arizona, where on Feb. 22 the home-state crowd
presumably will help him build still more momentum so that he can
fairly sail into the wrap-it-all-up March 7 Super Tuesday primaries
in California, New York and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   A tall order, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   So how is the senator faring so far?
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, where for months he was running a weak fourth
behind Bush, Elizabeth Dole and Steve Forbes, he is now running a
fairly strong second and climbing, according to a Reuters poll
published last week. Bush still leads, roughly 2 to 1, but that
lead used to be 4 to 1.

<P>
   In South Carolina, there are no recent polls, but political
experts there say McCain seems to be running about as well as in
New Hampshire, and as in New Hampshire, he is putting together a
solid campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   And in Arizona, where once it seemed that Bush might ambush
McCain, a new Northern Arizona University poll indicates that the
senator has taken a lead of about 10 points. Earlier polls had Bush
ahead by about 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are shifting from Bush to McCain,'' said the poll's
director, Fred Solop.

 &HT;    Making the grade in parent-teacher conferences
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ They may only last 15 minutes, but those minutes
can prove invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking parent-teacher conferences. And talking is what
they're all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely an important 15 minutes,'' says Beth Vachon, a
fourth-grade teacher in Shepherdsville, Ky., and co-author of ``The
School Savvy Parent: 365 Insider Tips to Help You Help Your Child''
(Free Spirit, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps you understand more about what's going on in your
child's life. And it sends a message to your child that you care
and that school is important.''
</P>
<P>
   For many parents, it's the first one-on-one conversation with
their child's teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Approaches vary. Some schools include students, others don't.
Vachon prefers parents-only.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can talk more honestly; we can get things out in the
open,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She always begins with the positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always something positive about each and every
child,'' believes Vachon.
</P>
<P>
   Megan McColaugh, a fifth-grade teacher at Tecumseh Elementary
School in Xenia, Ohio, says conferences provide a great opportunity
to create a home-school team.
</P>
<P>
   McColaugh and teaching partner Lisa Peterson say their goal is
to communicate how the student is doing in all areas of the school
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to discuss not only the student's academic work, but
learning styles and interactions between peers, teachers,
principals and all other support staff,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She says the most important step for parents is to show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very serious when I say that it is disappointing to have
'no-shows,''' McColaugh says. ``That may be your only communication
with that parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Collein has been teaching for 25 years and now instructs
at Belmont High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should come to a conference with specific questions in
hand,'' she advises, ``and they should ask to look at grades so
they have some idea of how a teacher is grading.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Dannemueller, a teacher who co-authors a parenting
column for the Erie Morning News, says parents should be aware of
the teacher's time constraints. ``As a courtesy to other parents
who are waiting, do your best to stay on schedule,'' she advises.
</P>
<P>
   She says many parents come to sessions on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love their children so much but sometimes they try to
protect them rather than guiding them. Parents will brush away
concerns I might have over a child who is not doing his homework
consistently by saying they're going through a divorce or their
spouse has lost a job. These are real concerns and stresses in a
child's life, but a child must be the number one priority in
parents' lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are ways to make parent-teacher conferences more productive
</P>
<P>
   _ Be aware of the teacher's communication system. Most teachers
send out a newsletter or syllabus that includes homework
assignments and expectations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk to your child before the conference about concerns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Come with an open mind and be open to suggestions. Look at the
teacher as a partner.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't dwell on problems your child has had with another
teacher in the past.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have concerns and issues, try to bring in specific
examples: a test or homework paper.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask questions about curriculum, how things are being taught.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you talk to your child, start with good things. Then
bring up changes that need to be made.
</P>
<P>
   _ Both parents should come to a conference. If that's
impossible, consider tape-recording the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents shouldn't feel intimidated; they are an integral part
of the school experience. If you don't understand things like
standardized test scores, bring them in and ask to have them
explained.
</P>
<P>
   _ Contact the teacher if you have additional issues or concerns
after the conference and need more time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try not to transfer your own learning problems to your child.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid calling a teacher at home unless she has given you her
number and invited parents to do so.
</P>

 &HT;    Walking around romance-novel formula
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KETTERING, Ohio _ Nicholas Sparks can't explain it, but he's
made note of the fact that the big-deal, best-selling love stories
of the past two decades have been written by men.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Erich Segal (`Love Story'), Robert James Waller
(`Bridges of Madison County'), Nicholas Evans (`The Horse
Whisperer'), and me,'' he says in a voice void of guile. Evans, who
stormed the scene with ``The Notebook'' and its followup, ``Message
in a Bottle,'' which was made into a film starring Kevin Costner,
is then quick to point out that there's a difference between a
romance novel and a love story.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, love stories aren't written to a formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult genre to write in because you're dealing
with a very universal emotion _ love. Practically everyone falls in
love at one point,'' he said. ``The challenge is to describe it in
a new way and not become cliched. And that's almost impossible. How
do you describe fire without using the word `hot'?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge challenge to writing a quality love story,'' he
said. ``There are a lot of romance stories, but very few love
stories are written.''
</P>
<P>
   And love stories don't usually end happily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes all the way back to Greek tragedies,'' Sparks said.
``And Shakespeare. If you ask people which play they remember best,
the majority will say `Romeo and Juliet.' `Hamlet' is a better
play, `Macbeth,' or `Othello' ... but people remember `Romeo and
Juliet.'''
</P>
<P>
   Writing formula-defying novels about often tragic love is a
challenge Sparks keeps coming back to, settling on a theme worthy
of exploration before each book. While the themes may differ, the
setting remains the same: Sparks' own, beloved North Carolina,
where he lives in New Bern with his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to make each book as different as possible from the last
in nearly every aspect,'' he said. ``In `The Notebook,' the theme
was everlasting love, unconditional love. `Message in a Bottle' was
about a second chance at love. `A Walk To Remember' is about the
beauty, power and innocence of first love.''
</P>
<P>
   His fourth novel, which he just finished writing, is about love
as rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another love story based in North Carolina, believe it or
not,'' he laughed. ``It's a more contemporary novel, more similar
to `Message in a Bottle,' but a little longer and the characters
are in their 30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme for my fifth novel _ which is as far as I can go,
because I haven't written one word _ is married love.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of Sparks' novels has been inspired by actual characters
and actual events, but, Sparks said, ``those are just initial
inspirations. The stories come entirely from my head. I don't write
memoirs and I don't write nonfiction. I make it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks came to the writing life through boredom, nursing a track
injury the summer after his freshman year at Notre Dame. That first
attempt is still in his attic, as is his second, and it's there
they will remain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're there for all eternity,'' he laughed. ``They're really
terrible. It would take much more effort to mold them into
something that's even readable than it would be to write a new
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, they're not in my genre. One was horror, one was a
murder mystery. I see no reason at all to publish them. I really
regard it as my initial education in writing novels. I didn't major
in liberal arts, and did not have a lot of writing experience. I
consider those novels as school efforts, but they taught me two
important things: One, that I enjoyed the process of storytelling,
and two, that I had it in me to finish a novel I started.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sparks took a while to commit to writing as a way of
life. After college, he worked a series of short-term jobs,
including waiting tables and selling pharmaceuticals. All was well,
but Sparks felt something was missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned 28 and was very happy in my life. Everything was
going great, but I didn't feel like I was chasing any dreams
anymore. I had no long-term goals. And I decided to give writing
another shot.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked for a story and found it in the true-life tale of his
wife's grandparents, who'd recently passed away.
</P>
<P>
   The result was ``The Notebook,'' and a career was born. Now, at
33, Sparks has defined his dream and cemented his name as a writer
of love stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a young writer,'' he said. ``I still have a lot to
learn about the craft. I still can improve.

(ATTN: ITALY, N.Y.)  
 LEO LIONNI, 89, ARTIST AND CHILDREN'S BOOK CREATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN HELLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leo Lionni, who introduced an introspective sensibility to
children's literature through the metaphorical characters
Frederick, Swimmy and Little Blue and Little Yellow, died on Monday
at his home near Radda in the Chianti district of Italy. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Lionni was an artist, magazine art director, graphic designer,
children's book illustrator and author. He had many careers,
including Futurist painter, architectural critic for the Italian
magazine Casabella, advertising designer for the N.W. Ayer agency
in Philadelphia, graphic design consultant to Olivetti in Milan and
the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, art director for Fortune,
Print and Panorama magazines and professor of design at Cooper
Union.
</P>
<P>
   But he earned worldwide popularity as the author and illustrator
of more than 30 children's books, many of which were translated
into numerous languages and are still in print.
</P>
<P>
   He turned to creating children's books at 50, and, even after he
began to suffer from Parkinson's disease 15 years ago, he was
extraordinarily productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Blue and Little Yellow,'' Lionni's first children's
book, began as a desperate effort to calm his two rambunctious
grandchildren on an hourlong train ride from Manhattan to
Greenwich, Conn. It was 1959, and Lionni, then the art director of
Fortune magazine, was taking the two to his suburban home. Unable
to quiet them, he took a copy of Life magazine from his briefcase
and turned to a page dominated by blue, yellow and green. He tore
the paper into small circles, then improvised a story that captured
their attention.
</P>
<P>
   His story was about two circles, Little Blue and Little Yellow,
the best of friends, who go on a hike. While playing hide-and-seek
in a forest, they lose sight of each other. They search everywhere
to no avail. Suddenly, behind a large tree, they are reunited and
hug; doing so, they become Little Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children were transfixed,'' Lionni recalled in his memoir,
``Between Worlds'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1997). ``And I noticed that
the passengers who were sitting within hearing distance had put
down their papers and were listening, too. So for their benefit, I
had Little Green go to the stock exchange, where he lost all his
money. He broke out in yellow and blue tears, and when he was all
tears, he was Little Blue and Little Yellow again and their stock
rose 12 points.''
</P>
<P>
   Lionni eventually presented a refined version of the story to
Fabio Coen, the children's editor for MacDowell Obolensky in New
York, who agreed to publish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take more than one evening with Fabio before I could
fully understand how much the simple little tale of two blobs of
color would affect my soul, my mind and my way of life,'' Lionni
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Lionni was born in the Netherlands in 1910. His father
was a diamond cutter and his mother was a singer. His Uncle Piet,
an architect, gave the boy his first set of drafting tools; two
other uncles, both collectors of modern art, fed his artistic
inclinations. One uncle hung a Chagall painting outside the boy's
room.
</P>
<P>
   Lionni studied arts and crafts in primary school and was
permitted to draw at the Rijksmuseum, where he copied plaster
casts; he later recalled feeling that Rembrandt, van Gogh,
Mondrian, architecture and music were ``one big mood to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was 14, he lived in Philadelphia, where his father
worked for Atlantic Richfield Co. A year later, he moved to Genoa,
Italy, where he attended a commercial high school, learned Italian
and became conversant in Italian art, literature and poetry. At 16,
he met Nora Maffi, who a few years later became his wife. The
marriage endured for 69 years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Louis Manny;
four grandchildren, Pippo Lionni and Annie Lionni (for whom
``Little Blue and Little Yellow'' was conceived) Gina Zucker and
Sylvan Lionni, and six great-grandchildren.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His wife's father was a founder of the Italian Communist Party
and was placed under house arrest by the Fascists after their rise
to power in 1922. This had a strong effect on Lionni's own
political consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1920s, he had become interested in commercial art
and produced his own advertisement proposals for Campari, which had
a progressive graphic policy. Inspired by Futurist art, he found
himself painting turbulent abstractions in 1931. His work caught
the eye of F.T. Marinetti, leader of the faded Futurist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Lionni was ambivalent about such recognition: Futurism
celebrated Fascism, and its chaotic esthetic conflicted with his
own rationalism. ``I am really Dutch,'' he wrote. ``I felt closer
to de Stijl, and respond to the patterns and symmetry of the tulip
fields.''
</P>
<P>
   While designing advertisements for a living, he attended classes
at the University of Genoa, earning a doctoral degree in economics.
He returned to Philadelphia to work as a designer for N.W. Ayer.
</P>
<P>
   Lionni's other early jobs included art direction for
advertisements for Ladies' Home Journal, Ford Motor Co. and the
Container Corp. of America, for which he commissioned illustrations
from Willem de Kooning, Alexander Calder and Fernand Leger for a
celebrated series of ads based on great ideas. He also worked with
a young Andy Warhol on the Regal Shoes account.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, Lionni moved to New York, and one of his first
assignments was for Fortune magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Henry Luce asked me,'' he said, ```Why can't Fortune be
as good looking as Harper's Bazaar?' My answer was obvious:
`Because businessmen are not as good looking as fashion models.'''
</P>
<P>
   He accepted the challenge nonetheless, changing the magazine's
format and typography and giving unparalleled exposure to
illustrators and fine artists who created pictorial essays.
</P>
<P>
   He was a consultant to Luce on the prototype for Sports
Illustrated. He designed the Museum of Modern Art's catalog for
Edward Steichen's milestone photography exhibition ``The Family of
Man,'' which is still in print, and the American Pavilion for the
1958 Brussels World's Fair.
</P>
<P>
   At 50, Lionni decided to resettle in Tuscany, where he painted
and created huge fantasy plants in brass and iron. Seeking a way to
combine his applied and fine art work, he hit upon children's books
as the perfect means. There he found the key to unlocking decades
of personal fears, joys, insecurities and loves, by presenting them
through animal metaphors. The books offer windows onto what he
called ``the soul.'' ``Little Blue and Little Yellow,'' ``Swimmy,''
``Frederick,'' ``Nicolas, Where Have You Been?'' and ``Matthew's
Dream,'' among his most popular and introspective books, are, on
one level, autobiographies.
</P>
<P>
   For his second book, Lionni did not resort to, as he said,
``Little Blue Goes to the Zoo.'' Instead, he wrote and illustrated
``On My Beach There Are Many Pebbles,'' a collection of drawings of
fish pebbles, people pebbles and so on, hidden among the real
pebbles, realistically rendered in pencil.
</P>
<P>
   In his third book, ``Inch by Inch,'' he developed the first of
his animal fables. ``Although it doesn't have an explicit moral, it
invites a search for meaning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Inch by Inch,'' a helpless inchworm uses ingenuity to
outwit a powerful bird. The story carries a recurring message: that
the imagination can transcend all obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   His best-known book, ``Swimmy,'' is about a diminutive fish
bamboozling its predator, a giant tuna, by organizing other smaller
fish into the shape of a large one. When Swimmy says, ``I will be
the eye,'' it is clear that this is also a portrait of the artist
as seer.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Foster, his editor for many years, said, ``I think
that's certainly the way Leo saw his role as an artist, seeing for
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tillie and the Wall,'' from 1989, a book about seeing beyond
impenetrable barriers, was published in Germany around the time
that the Berlin wall fell, and it sold well there. Lionni was so
excited by the potential of this book to impart more worldly ideas
that he decided that from then on, everything he did would have
some sort of social message.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt that the world was in such a state that he really
couldn't afford not to use the picture book as a kind of soapbox,''
Ms. Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, his critically praised memoir was published. Bruce
McCall wrote in The New York Times Book Review that it was the
story of ``a man with exquisitely fine-tuned creative imagination,
a clear mind, perfect taste and mercilessly high standards.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Parkinson's disease left him unable to type or
sketch, but he kept conceiving ideas for more stories and fables.
</P>
<P>
   Lionni once confessed in an interview that he had trouble with
children, even grandchildren, in small groups. ``I don't know how
to get to them,'' he said, ``and so I do banal things,'' like
making noises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could just read them something.''

ISSUE BY ISSUE, FIRST LADY SPELLS OUT DIFFERENCES WITH NEW YORK
CITY MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton moved to draw a series of
sharp differences with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Saturday,
attacking the legacy of Ronald Reagan's economic policies two weeks
after Giuliani celebrated them, and assailing Republicans for
blocking a minimum wage increase and promoting the use of school
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, in the course of a 20-minute speech and a news
conference, did not once mention the name of her likely opponent in
next year's race for the U.S. Senate. But her audience _ members of
District Council 37, the New York City workers union, which
supported Giuliani's mayoral bid in 1997 _ clearly understood her
meaning. They cheered boisterously as she methodically attacked
positions Giuliani has embraced while laying the groundwork for his
expected campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It was by any measure the closest that Mrs. Clinton has come to
engaging Giuliani. The litany of issues that she mentioned, and her
repeated allusions to Reagan, strongly suggested that Mrs. Clinton,
like most Democratic candidates running for statewide office in
this Democratic state over the last 20 years, would attempt to
frame the contest as a stark choice between Democratic and
Republican views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about what I believe and drawing a contrast with
others who don't believe as I do,'' the first lady said at a news
conference Saturday morning. ``I don't think that Reaganomics and
supply-side economics was the right direction for this country. I
don't think studying the minimum wage to death instead of raising
it is fair to working people. I don't think that turning back the
comprehensive test ban treaty was in our national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``So on this and many other issues, there is a clear contrast _
and there will be a very clear choice,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she never mentioned the mayor by name, the first lady,
who is in the midst of eight days of unbroken campaigning in New
York, responded: ``I am not a candidate yet. I am not engaged in
the campaign. But I am laying out the positions that I believe in,
that I think that most New Yorkers agree with. So as we move
forward into the year 2000 _ which is actually the election year,
as opposed to this year _ I think that those contrasts and choices
will become clearer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's remarks came at an event that demonstrated the
extent of her support among New York's labor unions. District
Council 37 supported Giuliani when he ran for mayor in 1997, in
what was a particularly unwelcome moment for Ruth Messinger, the
Democratic candidate. The union, though, is under new leadership,
and from the moment Mrs. Clinton walked in the door _ to shouts of
``Run, Hillary, Run'' _ it was clear that Giuliani could not rely
on its support this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say this: When you announce, District Council 37
endorses,'' the union's administrator, Lee Saunders, said as he
introduced Mrs. Clinton. ``Aren't I right? Stand up! Aren't I
right?'' The audience rose in cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders said afterward that there was a ``clear difference in
the positions that they take,'' referring to Giuliani and Mrs.
Clinton. Asked about the change since the union endorsed Giuliani
in 1997, the responded: ``The mayor's race was the mayor's race.
This is the Senate race.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, through a spokeswoman, declined to respond to the
specifics of Mrs. Clinton's remarks Saturday. ``She is right that
she not a candidate,'' the spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, said. ``She
is not a resident. So it is difficult to believe how she might be
able to speak for most New Yorkers, or for that matter any New
Yorkers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first lady's speech wove together issues that she and her
aides have raised piecemeal in recent weeks, in an attempt to prod
Giuliani to take the Republican side on legislation being debated
in Congress. The effort aspires to blunt what Mrs. Clinton's
advisers see as one of Giuliani's strengths _ that he is a moderate
Republican who can easily draw Democratic and independent votes.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Giuliani has aligned himself with Republicans
by opposing ratification of a nuclear test ban treaty and declining
to endorse legislation passed by the House to regulate health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has also declined to endorse an increase in the minimum
wage to $6.50 from $5.50, pending studies that he said were
necessary to make certain that a higher rate would not lead to the
elimination of many low-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton devoted much of her attention Saturday to attacking
the economic policies of Reagan, previewing a campaign strategy
that evoked Mario Cuomo's first successful campaign for governor in
1982. Her remarks came less than three weeks after Giuliani gave a
speech at the Reagan Library in California, paying warm tribute to
the former president and presenting himself as a Reagan Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure,'' Mrs. Clinton said in her speech
Saturday, ``that we have someone representing New York who will
stand up against any effort to go back, to make a U-turn to the
days of trickle-down, supply-side economics. Anybody who praises
Reaganomics and supply-side economics must not have a good memory
about what was happening in New York in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not let anyone take us back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also drew an unstated contrast with Giuliani in noting his
support for school vouchers, something that Mrs. Clinton and labor
leaders argue would harm the public school system. ``There are some
who would undermine and dismantle the public school system in our
country,'' she said. ``It is important that we stand behind our
public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the same lines, Mrs. Clinton was critical of Republicans
for passing legislation to use part of the nation's projected
surplus for cutting taxes, a position that Giuliani also said he
supported. Mrs. Clinton, like her husband and most Democrats, said
she supported smaller tax cuts, and using the money to shore up the
Social Security and Medicare systems. ``The Republicans in Congress
would instead spend $800 billion in exploding tax cuts,'' she said.
``That is wrong. It will not solve our problems.''

NEW JERSEY BROWNFIELDS ARE DRAWING DEVELOPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYONNE, N.J. _ Huge trucks rumble over uneven ground
overlooking Upper New York Bay, carrying loads of construction
debris and other fill that are reshaping a site that was the town
dump for most of the century. The old dump is to be capped with 4.5
million cubic yards of sediment dredged from nearby shipping
channels, and is then to be covered with several feet of clean dirt
to create Hudson County's first 18-hole golf course.
</P>
<P>
   The Bayonne site is a ``brownfield,'' contaminated land that has
sat unused because of the cost and risks of redevelopment. This
area, in the Constable Hook part of the city, was a part of the bay
until the early 1900s, when municipal garbage and industrial waste
began to be dumped.
</P>
<P>
   The site was closed to dumping in 1983 and has been vacant ever
since, despite being open land in a densely populated region. What
kept developers away was the stew of toxic substances beneath the
ground; in addition to garbage residue, the site contained dyes,
hydrocarbons and drums filled with unidentified materials.
</P>
<P>
   The long delay in cleaning up such neglected sites is coming to
an end in many locations, particularly in New Jersey. Over the last
few years an increase in land values, changes in legislation
regulating cleanups, the development of insurance policies that
limit liability and the success of some pioneering projects have
encouraged developers to pay more attention to brownfields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brownfield development in the state of New Jersey is off the
scale,'' said Richard Gimello, the assistant commissioner for
remediation in the state's Department of Environmental Protection.
He estimated that 1,000 to 1,200 of the state's more than 8,000
known contaminated sites are being worked on or are under active
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having trouble finding case managers to handle the
workload,'' he said. ``It's a boom.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's brownfield redevelopment is the most active in the
metropolitan area because the regulatory climate in the other
states is less certain. In Connecticut, efforts are under way to
clean up former industrial sites in the Housatonic and Naugatuck
River valleys.
</P>
<P>
   New York retains the strict cleanup laws adopted in the 1980s
after the discovery of extensive contamination in the Love Canal
area of Niagara falls, but state officials are reported by industry
executives to be closely studying developments in New Jersey, and
pressure is building to change the rules to permit economic
development in the low-income areas that are typically near tainted
land.
</P>
<P>
   Brownfield developers say the strict standards imposed by these
older laws are less of a problem than the uncertainty over how
government will act. The developers also argue that it makes
economic sense to impose lower cleanup standards on sites that will
be put to industrial or commercial use than those that will be used
for housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With some of this old legislation, you never knew what the
requirements were and how you could get out of a project,'' said
Ronald Bruder, president of Brookhill Group, which says it is the
oldest and largest redeveloper of brownfield sites in the country.
He said the company was doing business in more than 30 states where
legislation more friendly to brownfield development has been
adopted or the state environmental agency has taken a helpful
stance.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder said Brookhill was currently looking at four sites in New
Jersey and expected to close on at least one before the end of the
year. But he said he planned no projects in New York until laws and
regulations were changed.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder said brownfield redevelopment involves two main issues:
the cost of cleanup and the property's potential for reuse. ``We'll
drill a lot of wells and do a lot of investigating and develop a
number for the cost of clean-up. Then you have to figure the value
in an adaptive reuse to decide whether to do the project.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that because many sites can be capped and reused without
extensive cleaning, the environmental part of the equation is often
less important than the site's real-estate potential. This means
that an easily cleaned brownfield in a remote location may be less
valuable than a dirty one that's convenient to potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   Location meant a lot to the company that converted an old city
dump in Elizabeth to the site of the Jersey Gardens shopping mall,
which is due to open before the end of the month on the east side
of the New Jersey Turnpike within view of Newark International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Under a complicated arrangement with state officials and private
companies, the 255-store outlet mall is to have its own exit from
the Turnpike, where 180,000 cars carrying potential shoppers pass
by every day. The company, now known as OENJ-Cherokee, bought the
185-acre site land for $10 million in 1992, spent $12.5 million
remediating it and sold most of it to Glimcher Realty Trust in 1997
for $38 million to build Jersey Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   OENJ-Cherokee retained about 40 acres of land facing Newark Bay,
where it is planning a marina with ferry service to New York City
and retail, entertainment and hotel development. The same company
is also proceeding with the project in Bayonne and is seeking to
turn an abandoned railroad and dock site in Woodbridge to an
intermodal shipping center.
</P>
<P>
   The structure of the company is an indication of how the
brownfield cleanup business has developed in recent years. It was
originally started, to do the Elizabeth project, in the early 1990s
by two Danish businessmen, Peter Aargaard and Peter Pfeiffer. It
has since largely been taken over by Cherokee Investment Security,
a Denver-based company that manages funds raised from investors who
see bargains in environmentally impaired real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Cherokee formed Cherokee Investment Partners II,
to raise $250 million in equity from investors such as pension
funds. The fund's first investment was to acquire OENJ's three
waterfront sites for about $53 million.
</P>
<P>
   Local companies have seen opportunities in converting
contaminated sites as well. G. Heller Enterprises, of Edgewater
capped a site on Route 440 in Jersey City that contained toxic
chromium compounds in order to make it suitable as the location for
a Home Depot store.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the company, in combination with Starwood Capital
Group of Greenwich, Conn., bought a 63-acre site in Edison from
Revlon Corp. for remediation and redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   A major spur to the activity in New Jersey was the enacting in
early 1998 of the Brownfield and Contaminated Site Remediation Act.
The law protects buyers of contaminated sites _ called innocent
purchasers _ from private lawsuits related to past pollution by
other parties, as long as the land is cleaned up to state
standards.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The law establishes different standards of cleanliness, with the
highest for land to be used for residences and a lesser standard
for industrial and commercial uses. It also permits the use of
impermeable caps to prevent hazardous material from leaking out,
rather than a complete removal of industrial residues, a much more
costly undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Another important section is the provision of closure for
brownfield projects by authorizing the Department of Environmental
Protection to issue a covenant not to sue once a site has been
cleaned to the relevant standard. And ``innocent party'' developers
can receive tax breaks up to 75 percent of the cost of a project.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past you were never sure what the requirements were to
get out of a project,'' Bruder said. ``Now there is a lot more
certainty.'' And he said the recognition that all sites do not need
to be made utterly pristine was similarly helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to get everything out of the ground to guard
against health hazards,'' he said. ``You can cap a site and put a
covenant in the title that the property is never to be used as a
nursery.''
</P>
<P>
   But capping and covering leaves pollutants in place, and that
may pose a long-term threat to drinking water supplies, said Bill
Wolfe, policy director for the Sierra Club of New Jersey. ``The
problem is with technical standards,'' he said. ``The law now
allows a nonpermanent remedy where we prefer a permanent one.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources
Defense Council in New York, said economics have to be considered
along with environmental concerns. ``There are some pollutants _
such as lead and asbestos _ and some uses where capping and
covering makes sense. But if you are dealing with volatile
hydrocarbons, it has to be cleaned. We have to be sophisticated and
allow for a variety of approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   As helpful as the New Jersey law and similar legislation in
other states has been, some developers say the development of
insurance policies for brownfield projects has been more important
in limiting a developer's liability and ensuring nervous lenders
that they will not be stuck with a dirty tract of land if something
goes awry and they have to foreclose on the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the government giveth, the government can taketh away,''
said Christopher Daggett, a former New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection commissioner, who noted that companies who
disposed of wastes in what were considered acceptable ways were
branded as evil polluters once the Superfund Act was adopted by
Congress. Daggett is now president of Chadwick Partners of
Somerset, a brownfield developer.
</P>
<P>
   He said he viewed the availability of insurance as a far more
secure protection for developers than government regulations,
because an insurance policy is a legally enforceable contract that
is not as subject to changing political winds as environmental
rules. He said that with this protection now available and with the
price of land rising in many areas, developers are now more
interested in contaminated sites they previously avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Irving Cohen, president of OENJ-Cherokee, said insurance is part
of what the company brings to a transaction. ``We provide indemnity
for the seller of property,'' he said. ``We transfer the risk to
the balance sheet of an insurance company.''
</P>
<P>
   The company brought a double-barreled environmental approach to
both the Elizabeth and Bayonne projects. Both are former municipal
and industrial dumps that had to have the worst contaminants
removed and the rest stabilized and capped. Subsidence of the
surface can be a problem for old garbage dumps as organic material
decays, but the Elizabeth and Bayonne sites had been closed for so
long that little organic material was left.
</P>
<P>
   The capping material used in Elizabeth and planned at Bayonne is
the muck dredged out of New York Harbor to keep shipping lanes deep
enough for modern freighters. For decades the spoil was dumped at
sea. But the harbor is the recipient of the pollution that flows
down the region's rivers and falls from the air. It contains small,
but detectable, amounts of heavy metal compounds, PCBs and toxic
hydrocarbons.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have argued that when the dredged mud is
dumped at sea, these toxics disperse in the water, where they are
taken up by marine organisms and tend to accumulate in the flesh of
larger hunter species that become seafood for humans. In recent
years federal regulators have greatly restricted ocean dumping of
dredge material.
</P>
<P>
   Dredging is a fact of life in the port, where the Newark Bay
section is naturally only about 18 to 19 feet deep. The channels
leading to the container ports off the Kill Van Kull in Newark and
Elizabeth are currently dredged to a depth of 45 feet and there are
proposals pending to dig down to 50 feet, to accommodate a new
generation of larger ships.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition to digging deeper channels, dredging must be
performed to maintain existing depths in the face on an estimated 1
million metric tons of silt that flows downstream from the region's
rivers each year. The New Jersey side of the harbor produces, on
average, 1.82 million cubic yards of dredge material each year,
according to Frank McDonough, executive director of New Jersey's
Maritime Resources Agency.
</P>
<P>
   All that muck has to go someplace, and with ocean dumping
largely curtailed public officials and private developers have been
seeking land applications. This is an approach that has the
approval of environmentalists, if the material is treated to
prevent the spread of toxics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel there are a lot less pathways to humans with upland
disposal than with aquatic disposal,'' said Andrew Willner,
director of the New York-New Jersey Baykeeper program.
</P>
<P>
   OENJ's approach, developed after a year of testing, is to mix
the dredge material with binders such as Portland cement and
lime-kiln dust in a large cylindrical tank called a pug mill which
is located at the site. Once mixed, the material is dumped in piles
on the site and allowed to dry before being spread out over the
land.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting material is said to be resistant to penetration by
water and to have enough physical strength to hold up a shopping
center, as it has at the Elizabeth site.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cohen, the Bayonne site will be capped and
contoured according to the needs of the as-yet-unselected golf
course developer. It is to be covered with at least 2 feet of clean
fill so that grass and plants can be grown and golfers can be
protected from any contact with the dredged material. The course is
expected to open in the latter part of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   This dual approach, which is being employed by others, enables a
company to do well by doing good. In addition to improving the
value of the land, OENJ gets paid by the Port Authority for
accepting the dredge material and treating it.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wakeman, the Port Authority's dredging program manager, said
that demand for dredge material had increased as the Elizabeth
project has shown that is a good alternative to buying dirt to seal
sites like old dumps. That means the agency has been paying less to
get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   He said OENJ was paid $56 a cubic yard to accept and treat the
material used in Elizabeth, $40 to treat it and $16 as a tipping
fee to take off the agency's hands. Tipping fees are common in the
waste disposal business. And $56 a cubic yard was a huge saving
from the $118 a cubic yard the Port Authority had to pay to ship
dredge material from the Howland Hook marine terminal on Staten
Island, N.Y., to Utah when ocean dumping first became unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   But as dredge material has come to be regarded less as waste and
more as a useful raw material, the tipping fee has declined to $8 a
cubic yard in more recent transactions and is expected to go lower
still in negotiations now under way, Wakeman said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the agency still is paying developers to bring the
material up to environmental standards and is currently paying
about $35 a cubic yard, although other harbors have gotten that
down to $10 to $20 a cubic yard, according to Wakeman.
</P>
<P>
   This payment for treating dredge material appears to be behind
the proposed second phase of the Bayonne project, which would
involve filling 300 acres of open water between the upland part of
the site and the Military Ocean Terminal to the north. The filling
operation would consume as much as 10 million cubic yards of dredge
material over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said studies had shown that shallow water in the area was
not a habitat for marine organisms and said the site would be
developed into a park with ballfields, a marina and a
wetlands/wildlife refuge area that would be donated to Bayonne.
</P>
<P>
   But securing permits for the second phase may be far more
difficult than the first, given the reluctance of environmental
groups and government agencies to eliminate any wetlands areas.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Bayonne, Joseph Doria, who as a leader in the state
Assembly helped pass the brownfields legislation, said the public
golf course would be a welcome addition to the community. ``The
land had limited use as a brownfield,'' he said, ``but blending it
with the dredge creates 130 acres of needed open space.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it would neatly complement anticipated commercial
development on the 437-acre Military Ocean Terminal, which is
reverting to the city's control.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase, he said, ``is a much more difficult problem
and there is a question of whether it will come to pass.'' He noted
that no permits have been issued for the second phase and said that
filling in wetlands ``is a significant issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether particular wetlands should be filled aside,
finding a beneficial use for the dredge material is a ``triple
win'' for the port and the environment, according to McDonough of
N.J. Maritime Resources. ``We remove the material, use it to cap a
brownfield and we get a remediated site,'' he said.

CHARMED BY HIS PREY, EXTERMINATOR PLANS A BUG MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ Chris Koerner has been killing bugs for
more than a decade, but he bears his enemy no ill will. In fact,
Koerner, a professional exterminator, says he is going to build the
first museum in New Jersey dedicated solely to insects.
</P>
<P>
   The bug museum, tentatively named the Insectropolis, will be
built in a 7,000-square-foot building behind the offices of Ozane
Termite and Pest Control in Toms River, the exterminating company
that Koerner and his father, Thomas, have owned for nearly 35
years.
</P>
<P>
   Although a professional bug killer erecting a temple to his prey
might seem strange, Koerner said the Insectropolis would be a
natural extension of a life spent in the company of beetles,
bedbugs and other pests. The idea came to him three years ago, he
said, when he and his wife visited a rock museum erected by a
stonemason in Monroe Township.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both impressed by how these guys took what was
interesting about their business and put it on display,'' Koerner
said. ``Lots of kids out there enjoy bugs, and there's more and
more about bugs in the media these days, so I just thought we
should give it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is only in the planning stages, but Koerner said he
wanted to exhibit a wide range of bugs from unusual species to
common household nuisances like termites and roaches. He envisions
a pageant including giant millipedes, beetles, moths and water
bugs, and a display of live tarantulas, even though spiders are not
actually insects.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Dover Township Planning Board gave unanimous
approval to the bug museum, leaving Koerner free of obstacles
except for the question of where to find his specimens. ``We can
probably get most of them on the job,'' he said, ``but some of the
more exotic ones we'll have to purchase from biological
suppliers.''
</P>
<P>
   Building the bug museum will not be cheap. Construction,
scheduled to begin in the next two months, is expected to cost
between $350,000 and $500,000, Koerner said. He added that he and
his father have been saving for the project and planned to charge
$4 or $5 admission.
</P>
<P>
   Koerner said that he hoped Ocean County schools would make field
trips regularly to his museum and that he had talked with teachers
from a dozen county school districts about an entomological
curriculum for visiting students.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that bugs fascinated him. ``Being an exterminator,
you really have to understand insects,'' he said. ``And the more
you watch insects, the more you realize how much information you
can give to people. The problem is most people don't take time out
to appreciate them.''

 &HT;    Governors' races show party ties weakening
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Louisiana, Kentucky and Mississippi will elect
governors this fall, and the races reveal that party affiliation
doesn't matter like it used to.
</P>
<P>
   There are seven Republican governors in the South, a region
where not long ago, there were none. But Republicans are not
guaranteed to win in the way Democrats once were.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to who is the stronger candidate,'' said Merle
Black, a political science professor at Emory University. ``There's
no majority party anymore. These governorships could switch back
and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Foster, Louisiana's first Republican governor, expects to
trounce his competition in a primary Saturday. Because the state
has an open primary system instead of party primaries, any
candidate who gets more than 50 percent of the vote wins outright.
Foster is banking on that.
</P>
<P>
   His main advantage is not his party affiliation but a healthy
economy, which tends to breed a sense of satisfaction with the
status quo. It helps that his chief Democratic opponent, U.S. Rep.
William Jefferson (D-New Orleans), is relatively weak.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, in Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Paul Patton is
considered a shoo-in for re-election because his Republican
challenger, Peppy Martin, doesn't even have the full support of her
own party.
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, neither candidate is banking on his party to win
him the election. Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, a Democrat, and former
U.S. Rep. Mike Parker, a Republican, are competing to replace Gov.
Kirk Fordice, the state's first Republican governor since
Reconstruction. Fordice is barred by state law from running for a
third term.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mississippi, I'd say one-third of the voters are Democrats,
one-third are Republicans and one-third are independent, and they
are the swing voters,'' Parker said. ``That's the group that really
decides who the next governor will be.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say the South has gone to a simple system of
``may the best man (or woman) win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got two different ways of winning in the South today,
and both parties can win,'' Black said. ``Republicans can win if
they get a landslide of the white votes, and Democrats can win if
they put together a biracial coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   MAVERICK APPEAL
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, Foster is riding high on the strongest economy the
state has enjoyed in 30 years. He is a pro-business, pro-gun,
rough-talking duck hunter whose actions _ such as passing a law
allowing adults to ride motorcycles without helmets _ give him a
kind of maverick appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, the leading Democrat, has vast experience and solid
ideas for the state, but his message gets lost in his lack of
charisma, observers say. He also has image problems: He is black,
and he is from New Orleans, both of which lose him votes in rural
Louisiana. Many residents outside New Orleans perceive New
Orleanians as too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Jefferson is getting blacks excited, so their
turnout won't be great,'' said John Maginnis, publisher of the
Louisiana Political Fax Weekly. ``This race is really a referendum
on Foster, and he's already passed it.''
</P>
<P>
   The race is surprisingly scandal-free, for Louisiana. There was
a ripple of intrigue in May when it was revealed that in 1996,
Foster secretly paid former Ku Klux Klan leader and perennial
candidate David Duke $150,000 for his mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   The big scandals are happening on the sidelines: The insurance
commissioner and the elections commissioner have been indicted in
recent weeks, and both are running for re-election. That's legal in
Louisiana, unless they get convicted before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Improving education is a major issue in the Kentucky race for
governor, as is gambling. Patton wants to consider legalizing
casinos, whereas his Republican opponent, Martin, is opposed to
them. Meanwhile, a Reform Party candidate has attracted enough
attention to make Patton uncomfortable. Gatewood Galbraith, a
Lexington attorney and an advocate for legalizing marijuana, is
hoping for a Jesse Ventura-style victory. Ventura is the former pro
wrestler who won the Minnesota governor's race on the Reform Party
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know when there's ever been a credible third-party
candidate for governor here,'' said Nicki Patton, the state
Democratic Party chairwoman and the governor's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky Democrats are learning that their party doesn't hold
the same sway with the voters that it did in the past, Patton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are increasingly voting on the issue or the
individual,'' she said. ``More and more people are splitting their
ticket. We have a Democratic registration that is 2-to-1 in this
state, but there is no guarantee they're going to vote along party
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   CLOSE RACE IN MISSISSIPPI
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, voters are having a hard time distinguishing
between Parker and Musgrove. Both have had long political careers
and both are focusing on improving the state's dismal record on
education.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is as colorful as Gov. Kirk Fordice, and for many voters
that's probably a relief. Fordice, who made permanent enemies of
most of the legislators with his ornery nature, is now on the outs
with citizens. After years of rumor and innuendo, Fordice last
summer made public his extramarital affair with a Memphis woman and
said he was divorcing his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who left Congress after 10 years to run for the state's
top job, is not worried that he, like Fordice, is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fordice's problems transcend politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Musgrove are in a dead heat, but observers say
Musgrove will win if there is a large turnout of black voters, who
tend to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have used celebrities to attract attention in
the final weeks of their campaigns. Parker recently had a
$1,000-a-plate luncheon with Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the leading
candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Musgrove
hosted two events, each $100 a person, with popular author John
Grisham, an old friend of the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Who wins the race in Mississippi will have an effect on
congressional reapportionment, scheduled for 2000. There is a
chance Mississippi will lose a seat now held by a Democrat. A
Democrat in the governor's mansion could wield some influence over
that process.

TOWNS COLUMN: OH, THE TIMES THEY HAVE A-CHANGED

<P>
   FAIRFIELD, Conn. _ Melanie Lobue told her parents that she was
studying the 1960s in college and they laughed. ``What are we,''
they asked, ``ancient history?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Along with protest, commitment, Vietnam, nakedness, moral
anguish and guilt. These elements of the '60s have been taken up in
a semester-long, interdepartmental program at Fairfield University
taught by three professors who were there.
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone say ``generation gap''?
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing started when my friends and I were talking
about the fact that kids here don't get it about the '60s,'' said
Martha LoMonaco, a professor of visual and performing arts, who
created the course with colleagues in the history and sociology
departments. ``What the kids hear now about the '60s is basically
various sound bites that reduce it all to some crazed-out hippie
flashing a peace sign and holding a sign that says, `Make Love Not
War.'''
</P>
<P>
   What today's students think of the '60s, and of their own times,
depends of course on whom you ask. But it seems clear that when the
grown-ups hold up their younger days for study, the result is
likely to give some students, like Dante being led by Virgil, a
sense of their inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like it was an era of much greater social
consciousness,'' said Kathleen Moonie, a sophomore from Newton. ``I
think we've lost that to a certain extent _ I think kids are much
more conservative today.''
</P>
<P>
   And what do Fairfield students care passionately about today?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there's a large party scene, especially at the beach,''
said Jen Manaresi, a senior from Avon. ``I'm sure there's a
political scene going on somewhere, but I'm not involved in it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fairfield students are talking about ``the beach'' _
the area south of the campus where many off-campus students live _
in a way that illustrates how much, or how little, has changed
since their parents' generation.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, Fairfield students took over Canisius Hall,
forcing the president to climb out of his office window. This fall,
the administration started sending an official to ride with the
police on their weekend sweeps of unruly students at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``People stood up for what they believed then,'' Ms. Manaresi
said. ``From what I can tell, everything was more meaningful
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. LoMonaco's class is looking at the '60s through its
production of ``Hair,'' the Broadway rock musical chiefly
remembered for a few good tunes and its occasionally naked cast.
There will be no nakedness this time, but the students have used
the play's story of young people sorting out their loyalties over
the war in Vietnam to get a picture of what the war meant to their
parents, and by extension, to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Dorion's father was a medic in Vietnam, and the course
has awakened in him a vivid (perhaps exaggerated) sense of
differences in their lives. ``When my father was 19 he was
stitching people up on the battlefield,'' said Dorion, a junior
from Walpole, Mass. ``You know what I was doing last Friday?
Drinking!''
</P>
<P>
   Steve O'Connell, a senior from Erie, Pa., plays the part of
Claude, the boy who eventually dies in Vietnam. Would he go today
if he were called?
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell: ``I'm struggling with the idea of war, and what it
solves.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorion: ``If it was another Vietnam, no way I'd go.''
</P>
<P>
   So they would be happy to have mostly poor kids, without college
deferments, fight the war for them? ``I'm not happy about that
either,'' O'Connell said. ``Not a bit. I just don't know what I'd
do.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the Marines were recruiting down at the campus
center while this conversation was taking place, but they made
little impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked by a little faster,'' said Davis Wildman, a senior
who is part of the ``Hair'' production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oooh, men in uniform!''' Ms. Moonie cooed. ``But
maybe I shouldn't say that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marines reported not a hostile glance. ``This is a
military-friendly campus,'' said Lt. Robert Eric Carlson of the
Marines, himself a Fairfield University graduate.

 &HT;    Democrats draft fund-raisers for 2000 House races
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The challengers who are the Democrats' brightest
hopes for recapturing control of the House of Representatives in
2000 share a devotion to something higher than ideology in
turn-of-the-century politics.
</P>
<P>
   They can all raise big money, which confers instant credibility
in an era of million-dollar House campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans clinging to a majority so small that a shift of
five seats would bring the Democrats to power, both parties are
expecting fierce and costly campaigns in a couple of dozen
contested districts around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Although the vast majority of incumbents will cruise to
re-election, Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.), chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, likened the coming campaign to
``hand-to-hand combat'' in the contested districts.
</P>
<P>
   One of those districts runs east from the prosperous Charlotte
suburbs through some of the poorest rural counties in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Days after Democrat Mike Taylor narrowly lost his first race for
Congress last year, he received a call from the House Democratic
leadership, which had all but ignored his contest.
</P>
<P>
   Outspent 4-to-1 by Republican Robin Hayes, Taylor still came
within 3,400 votes of winning out of 133,000 votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   The sheepish message from Washington was, Please run again.
We'll help you this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden I had credibility,'' Taylor recalled,
chuckling at the irony of receiving an offer of help three days
after the voting.
</P>
<P>
   But, having come so close, Taylor is running again, and he is
finding it much easier to raise money for his rematch. On Saturday,
House Democratic Whip David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking
Democrat, headlined a fund-raising reception for Taylor in
Asheville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on money, which is not altogether new, can be heard
almost any time a Democrat introduces a highly rated contender for
a seat in the House.
</P>
<P>
   California state Sen. Adam Schiff receives applause merely for
having taken in half a million dollars for his run against Rep.
James Rogan (R-Calif.) in what is expected to be one of the
tightest and most expensive contests in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also are happy to have former Rep. Scotty Baesler seek
his old seat in Kentucky against freshman Rep. Ernie Fletcher
because Baesler is a known commodity with an extensive database of
contributors from his time in Congress and his failed U.S. Senate
campaign in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.), chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, bluntly said that one of his
goals next year is to reduce the Republican cash advantage to
2-to-1, ``which will give us enough money to get our message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are counting on winning some rematches, including Pat
Casey against Republican Rep. Don Sherwood in Pennsylvania and
Marjorie McKeithen against Republican Rep. Richard Baker in
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats enter the campaign season with one major advantage
_ they have fewer open seats to defend. Open seats are those in
which an incumbent is not seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans are counting on some breaks of their own.
The biggest one they envision is named George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the leading presidential candidate has voiced criticism
of Republicans in Congress recently, Davis called Bush ``the goose
that will lay the golden egg.''
</P>
<P>
   While Davis would not predict what might happen nearly 13 months
from now, he said that if Bush remains as strong as he now appears,
his coattails could provide the margin of difference in a handful
of congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential elections draw more voters, who are not as engaged
in politics as those who vote year in, year out. So in Davis' view,
these voters would be more likely to cast a Republican ballot in
their congressional race because they would be turning out to vote
for the GOP presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The big question for both parties is whether the 2000 election
will have a national, unifying theme. At one time, impeachment
seemed to be a galvanizing force.
</P>
<P>
   But while it may have led such candidates as Schiff and Georgia
Democrat Roger Kahn to run, impeachment has faded away as an issue.
Kahn, running against Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) talks more about Barr's
inability to serve his constituents than about his support for
Clinton's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina race is typical of the emerging campaign.
Hayes, an heir to the Cannon textile fortune, has spent his first
term in Congress tending to two vitally important constituencies in
his district, farmers and Fort Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   A former state lawmaker who lost a race for governor in 1996,
Hayes is a confident campaigner who said he has practically dared
Kennedy _ his colleague on the House Resources Committee _ to
campaign in the district on Taylor's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Tarring Southern Democrats with the Kennedy name and the liberal
politics that go with it is a tried and true Republican tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes tirelessly crisscrosses the district and has been given a
leading role in trying to secure flood relief funds for North
Carolina farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a Harvard-trained archaeologist who is a practicing
lawyer, said his politics are more in tune with the district than
are Hayes'.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor pointed to Hayes' vote against the managed care reform
bill co-authored by Rep. Charlie Norwood (R-Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor clearly is counting on being able to put himself on
television in the expensive Charlotte market.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hayes dominated the airwaves and won a resounding
victory in the populous Charlotte suburbs. ``Mike just didn't have
the money to compete on television,'' Taylor consultant Jim Duffy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Taylor promised, will be different.
</P>
<P>
   To which Hayes replied, ``Bring 'em on.''

FURORS ALL AROUND, BUT PATAKI LIES LOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY _ In the last month, deep in what is usually the snooze
season in state politics, there have been enough fires burning to
warm the heart of even the most jaded political junkie: Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's holy war against the Brooklyn Museum of Art and
its self-consciously shocking exhibition, President Clinton's
decision to offer clemency to imprisoned members of a Puerto Rican
nationalist group that carried out a bombing in New York City, and
the nascent Senate contest between Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   One voice has been notably quiet amid the noise, that of Gov.
George Pataki. When Pataki called a news conference on Thursday to
announce that he would impose new air pollution standards on power
plants, it was the first time in 17 days that he underwent
extensive questioning by reporters. In 14 of those 17 days, he made
no public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping a limited profile is nothing new for Pataki, whose
impressive record of winning battles on tax cuts, criminal justice,
the environment and other areas belies his image of genial
quietude. He long ago learned the political virtue of picking his
fights with care while saying as little as possible on most other
issues, a trait that helped him defeat the wearyingly voluble Mario
Cuomo in 1994. But even by the standards of this governor, he has
hunkered remarkably low in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The governor could be forgiven for not wanting to talk to
reporters lately. On Sept. 28, The New York Times reported that
Philip Morris had made large contributions to a private group, at
about the same time that the group paid for Pataki's trips to
Hungary in 1995 and 1996. Since then, it was reported that other
major companies that, like Philip Morris, have business interests
that are directly affected by state policies also supported the
trip's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference on Thursday, Pataki answered questions
for the first time about those trips, and if he had hoped that the
passage of more than two weeks would dim reporters' interest _
well, no such luck. The subject dominated the question-and-answer
session, and the governor, clearly exercised, dismissed the news
articles with a vulgarity, which practically qualifies as apoplexy
for a man so famously restrained in public.
</P>
<P>
   But Philip Morris is not the only subject Pataki has not
embraced. He has said little about Clinton's offer of conditional
clemency for members of the Puerto Rican group FALN, and then only
when asked. Some newspapers have reported that he never addressed
it at all. In fact, on Sept. 15, on Charlie Rose's interview
program on public television, he said of the offer of clemency,
``It was wrong,'' and added that it appeared that ``it was done
strictly for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, the governor was silent on the Brooklyn Museum
exhibition, which included a work that Giuliani called
anti-Catholic. On Sept. 27, Pataki said that he was glad no state
money was involved _ it turned out that the state had provided $2
million to the museum since 1995 _ and that he would not see the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Not until a week later, when campaigning with Gov. George W.
Bush, did Pataki say, ``When you use public money to denigrate
somebody's religion, I think that's wrong,'' and then only to echo
Bush's comment of a moment earlier. He has not weighed in on the
dispute since, and has not said whether he supported the mayor's
attempts to shut down the exhibit, cut off all city financing for
the museum and remove its board.
</P>
<P>
   Since the governor did not offer full-throated support of the
mayor, his longtime antagonist, in attacking the museum and
condemning the FALN clemency offer, many state Republicans have
grumbled that Pataki, despite his declarations to the contrary, is
still not committed to helping Giuliani get elected to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has also said nothing about the State University of New
York's $110 million deficit, which could reach $200 million before
the school year is over, and his administration has not commented
on some legislators' attempts to arrange a bailout for the system.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is expected to convene next month for a special
session to renew or replace the state's system for financing health
care for the poor and the education of new doctors, a topic that
has caused a fierce, yearlong lobbying war between the health care
industry and business groups. Again, the governor has taken no
position, and legislators in both parties who are immersed in the
issue say they have no idea where he will come down.
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, Pataki's communications director, angrily disputed
the suggestion that there was any need for him to be more vocal.
``The governor has and will continue to spend time communicating
with the people who elected him,'' she said. ``We have not and will
not rely on any press corps to disseminate our message or to learn
what the issues are. He's not going to be like Mario Cuomo, locked
in the Capitol and only talking to the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some obvious contrasts _ not just to Cuomo, but
to Giuliani, who takes reporters' questions every day and rarely
evades them, even when doing so might be to his benefit. Pataki's
longtime ally, former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, was also quick to offer
his views with little prompting.
</P>
<P>
   So what has Pataki done of late? He spent a few days in
California raising money for himself, a few days in New York
raising money for other Republicans, and a few more chaperoning
Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner, around the state.
Pataki would like to be considered as a possible running mate for
Bush next year, but even if he does not win that plum, being seen
at the Texas governor's side cannot hurt his stature.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, Pataki has been governing, Ms. Mucha said, even
if he has been largely invisible to the public. People close to him
said the governor had worked hard preparing his announcement of new
power plant emission standards, and on next year's state budget.
</P>
<P>
   After five years in office, being elusive has not hurt the
governor. His approval ratings in public opinion polls remain
comfortably high, above 50 percent, though they have fallen since
his re-election campaign last year. So far, New Yorkers seem not to
mind a governor who does not have an opinion for every moment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats _ and not a few Republicans _ keep predicting that
what they see as Pataki's detachment, even indifference, will
become the prevailing public image of him, to his harm.
</P>
<P>
   They're still waiting.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   KENANSVILLE, N.C. _ In the aftermath of Hurricane Floyd, loose
regulations that helped eastern North Carolina become the nation's
biggest producer of turkeys and the second biggest of hogs have
come back to haunt the state's public health and its environment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that the September storm that hit the region
harder than anywhere else, killing 48 people and leaving behind
more than $1 billion in largely inescapable damage, also left a
vast amount of damage that might have been averted: incalculable
and continuing hazards to ground water, wells and rivers from
animal waste, mostly from giant hog farms.
</P>
<P>
   For years, farmers had been free to build hog and poultry
operations as big as they wanted and where ever they liked. They
were allowed to dig huge pits for animal waste, without regard to
the water table or the health and sensibilities of neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In the hurricane, feces and urine soaked the terrain and flowed
into rivers from the overburdened waste pits the industry calls
lagoons. The storm killed more than 2 million turkeys, chickens and
livestock in the region, and waste from the farms is expected to
keep leaching into the water supply until next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a practical problem here,'' Gov. James B. Hunt Jr.
said. Normally by mid-October, Hunt said, farmers would have
reduced the levels of waste in the lagoons, where it evolves
naturally into nutrients that are sprayed on crops.
</P>
<P>
   But the lagoons are brimming with flood-bloated waste, and there
is less use for it now. The growth of crops slows in the fall, and
many fields have been saturated or rendered fallow by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ((On Thursday the State Department of Environment and Natural
Resources announced an ``emergency waste management strategy'' for
hog and poultry farms in an effort to keep waste out of the water
supply. The agency is easing restrictions on the spreading of waste
over fields, but it prohibited reconstruction of severely
hurricane-damaged waste lagoons in the flood plain.
</P>
<P>
   ((In the current soaked condition of the land, some waste
sprayed on the fields will spread. ``We recognize this policy could
contribute to water quality problems through the winter,'' said
Bill Holman, the state's assistant secretary for environmental
protection. ``There are so many swine operations we have a long way
to go.''))
</P>
<P>
   In Duplin County, of which Kenansville is the seat, and across
the rest of North Carolina east of Interstate 95, Hurricane Floyd
has exposed the hazards of one of farming's great innovations of
the 1980s and 1990s and the political liaisons that helped it
develop. That is the practice of industrial farming, or raising
livestock and poultry in close and confined quarters.
</P>
<P>
   It allows farmers to raise thousands of hogs on land where they
could once raise only scores and gives them tight and automated
control over their livestocks' diets, health and growth. The
farmers raise pigs under contract to major hog processors, known in
the business as integrators, like Murphy Family Farms of Duplin
County. The processor supervises the construction of barns,
supplies the pigs and their feed and medicine and hauls them off to
slaughter after the four or five months it takes for them to grow
to 250 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   For eastern North Carolina, this assembly-line production of
hogs and turkeys has come as a savior for tobacco farmers whose
incomes plunged with the decline in smoking. But Hurricane Floyd
has stirred controversy over a means of capturing the wastes of a
hog, which produces four times that of a human.
</P>
<P>
   Human waste in North Carolina and most of the nation must be
captured in public sewers and private septic systems to prevent the
spread of disease. But the state lets the waste of hogs, which
carries many human diseases, be captured by nothing more than a
cesspool. The poultry waste is far less of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The state had few rules for industrial farming until 1993, when
it enacted a law to prohibit livestock farms from intentionally
contaminating the public water supply. Then, two years ago, it put
a moratorium on hog farms.
</P>
<P>
   In Duplin County, 50 miles south of Raleigh, and the home of
42,000 people and 2.2 million hogs, Dr. Hervy Kornegay, a family
physician and chairman of the County Board of Health, said no
disease attributable to the flooding had developed. But as waste
seeps into the private wells that half the homes use for drinking
water, Kornegay said, ``the greatest potential for harm would be
severe gastroenteritis, with diarrhea and vomiting.''
</P>
<P>
   And the seepage is under way. Ronnie Kennedy, county director
for environmental health, said that of 310 private wells he had
tested for contamination since the storm, 9 percent, or three times
the average for eastern North Carolina, had fecal coliform
bacteria. Normally, tests showing any hint of feces in drinking
water, an indication that it can be carrying disease-causing
pathogens, are cause for immediate action.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even before the hurricane there had been flooding and ruptures
of the waste pits that contaminated rivers and killed millions of
fish. And with public fury rising over the acrid, ammonia-laden
odors from the waste lagoons, which carry for more than a mile,
Hunt had begun to call for restraints on an industry that he had
long allowed free rein.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, a Democrat, backs the Legislature's 1997 moratorium on
construction of new and expanded lagoons, which remains in effect
until July 2001. In April, the governor proposed a plan to phase
out the lagoon system over 10 years while engineers devise safer
methods for disposing of the hog waste. He also brought a former
Sierra Club lobbyist, Holman, the environmental protection
official, into his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``My views and most views have evolved to where we have to take
stronger action to clear up our water and rivers,'' Hunt said. ``We
need a strong economy for our people, but we cannot sacrifice the
environment for jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Molly Diggins, the North Carolina director for the Sierra Club,
said that the state had recently made progress in passing
environmental laws that would not have passed earlier, adding,
``But Floyd has set everyone back on their heels about how much
more has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Any legislation to tighten regulations on hog farms meets the
stiff resistance of companies like Murphy Family Farms, the
nation's biggest hog producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you do here,'' said Dennis McBride, the state
secretary for Health and Human Services, ``you're going to end up
in court. There's no question in my mind about that whatsoever.
We're not dealing with a group that's going to go without a
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry, whose North Carolina Pork Council vies with
tobacco as the state's mightiest lobby, contends that the lagoon
system held up well in the storm, that the bacteria in wells might
have come not from hogs but from people, factories, flooded water
treatment plants or migrating geese. The council said that only
three of some 4,000 waste lagoons had ruptured
</P>
<P>
   To protect the system, the council sent the state's
congressional delegation in Washington a document, dated Sept. 29
and entitled, ``Draft Legislation for Flood Relief for Farmers in
Eastern North Carolina.'' It seeks $1 billion in grants for farmers
in 41 counties to repair or replace storm-damaged facilities,
including waste lagoons, as they were originally built.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said of the document, ``It's `stunning and it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Anne Mumford, the council's spokeswoman, said the document,
disclosed on Oct. 8 by The News &AMP; Observer of Raleigh, had been
misunderstood. ``Its intent was to be sure assistance wasn't
prohibited,'' Ms. Mumford said. ``We're not illegal operations, so
we shouldn't be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the industry more entrenched, or its political power
stronger, or the hurricane's farm damage greater, than in Duplin
County. With 48 hogs for every one resident, the county has the
densest concentration of hogs in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The rectangular lagoons of reddish-brown waste, many of them
covering more than an acre, dot the flat countryside. Enclosed
within dikes, the lagoons sit behind rows of single-story,
gray-metal structures as large as football fields that house the
hogs. The hog waste flows through slotted boards in the barns to a
cellar, where plastic pipes carry it to a waste lagoon. The lagoons
now and then burp with the bubbles that mark the natural
transformation of feces and urine to the nutrients that farmers
spray over pastures and fields of corn, tobacco, soybeans and rye.
</P>
<P>
   In the hurricane, said Rick Shiver, regional supervisor for the
state Division of Water Quality, many of the lagoons flooded and
the three that ruptured were in Duplin County.
</P>
<P>
   The lagoon at Jesse Lanier's farm, with 1,200 hogs, was breached
when a stream rose and eroded the base of its dike. More than 2
million gallons of the lagoon's waste spilled into Rock Fish Creek,
which feeds the North East Cape Fear River.
</P>
<P>
   At Rabon Maready's farm, Shiver said, 1,000 of 1,600 hogs
drowned in the storm. Both lagoons there flooded and one ruptured
in five spots. Two lagoons at Joey Brinkley's 4,572-hog farm
flooded, and a 12-foot breach opened in one of them. Maready and
Brinkley are contract farmers for Murphy Family Farms of Rose Hill,
on the southern edge of the county.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Murphy, the company's founder and chief executive and a
major contributor to Hunt's campaigns, perfected the current system
of raising hogs for producers. It is the major reason the state's
hog population has grown to more than 9 million from less than 3
million a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was a state senator for 10 years, until 1992, and as a
legislator supported measures curbing counties' power to zone out
hog farms. Murphy would not comment for this article, said his
spokeswoman, Lois Britt.
</P>
<P>
   Britt said the company believed that counties should look within
for solutions to the environmental issues. ``It's easy to look from
outside and say what's wrong,'' she said. She said hog farming
provided jobs and tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hog lagoons,'' she added, ``held up fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, many farmers have mastered the intricate balance of
waste production, lagoon levels and spraying. The Division of Water
Quality said that it had never recorded a complaint against the hog
farm of Tony Jones, 30, of Mount Olive.
</P>
<P>
   Like nearly all hog farmers, Jones works under contract to a
producer. He raises 4,100 pigs in six barns and has two waste
lagoons.
</P>
<P>
   He said he constantly tests the lagoon waste. ``If it needs lime
to keep the odor down,'' he said, ``I add lime. If it needs
pumping, I pump on days that are optimum for pumping.''
</P>
<P>
   But other farms stir frequent complaints. Becky and Danny
Lancaster, who operate a rural welding supply business, live within
a mile of three farms they call offensive. Mrs. Lancaster, the
mother of two teen-agers, said: ``You don't plan birthday parties
outside. You no longer plan things. You plan around the odors and
flies.''
</P>
<P>
   She keeps a log of odors that waft her way. In September, she
made entries on six days. ``Nasty, musty, stifling odor in the
air,'' she wrote on Sept. 9, a humid and rainy day. ``Difficult to
breathe. Feel like suffocating. Like an old outhouse.'' On Sept.
23, she wrote, ``Smell of urine strong in air.''
</P>
<P>
   She produced another log she used to keep of the flies she
swatted in her office. She said that on May 22, 1996, ``I killed
1,192. The next day I killed 1,100. The next day it was 1,140.''
She added that flies appear in January, too.
</P>
<P>
   For years, said H.C. Powers, a 77-year-old retired school
principal and current chairman of the six-member Duplin County
Board of Commissioners, residents have been complaining of odors
and flies. But three board members always support the industry, so
attempts by Powers and two others to regulate the farms die in 3-3
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people here say more pollution control would only
imperil more farmers, who are already struggling. Pork prices have
been plunging for more than a year, so much so that Murphy has
agreed to sell out, for $450 million, to Smithfield Farms Inc. of
Virginia, the nation's leading slaughterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The county manager, James W. Barnhardt Jr., said farms in the
county that had $620 million in revenue two years ago are expected
to receive $170 million less this year. ``We are trying to
diversify,'' Barnhardt said. ``On the other hand, Duplin County is
a rural agricultural county. That's what we do.''

CAROL B. MANZONI, LAWYER WHO HELPED LEAD CHICAGO FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (js) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carol Berlin Manzoni, a Chicago lawyer whose knack for
recruiting clients propelled her rapid rise in the legal
profession, died on Oct. 9 at her home in Chicago. She was 52.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart disease, the Blake-Lamb Funeral Home said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manzoni was a leading player at Ross &AMP; Hardie, a
Chicago-based firm with about 180 lawyers and offices in Washington
and Manhattan. She specialized in cases involving labor and
employment, litigations and higher education law, and was known for
her energetic leadership style.
</P>
<P>
   She was a senior partner in the firm and served two consecutive
terms as co-chairwoman of its executive committee from 1995 to
1998. A colleague at Ross &AMP; Hardie, Richard E. Lieberman, said she
would probably have been in line for a third turn as co-chairwoman
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manzoni's swift professional rise began when few sizable law
firms counted women among their policy makers. She joined Ross &AMP;
Hardie in 1989, bringing with her enough clients to become an
instant equity partner.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manzoni, a native New Yorker, received a bachelor's degree
from Bucknell University in 1969 and a doctorate in law from
Catholic University of America in 1977. She recalled that when she
first presented herself at law firms, her interviewers usually
assumed she was applying for a secretary's job.
</P>
<P>
   She handled sexual discrimination suits for a Chicago firm for a
year, as she told The New York Times in 1996, ``writing briefs for
senior partners, and fuming a lot.'' Then, at a party, she met the
president of a local college who opened the way for her to give
labor seminars and thereby build her reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manzoni is survived by her husband, Michael G. Hron; two
stepsons, Benjamin and Jonathan, and a sister, Susan Klimpl, also
of Chicago.

BIRD RECALLS THE ONE BALL HE COVETED 
CRITICISM FOR SPREWELL VERDICT 
A KINDER, MORE SENSITIVE RILEY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 13 years ago, Larry Bird completed arguably his greatest
season by leading the Boston Celtics to a championship against the
Houston Rockets and being named the most valuable player of the
finals. He won a car for his efforts, but the only real possession
he valued was the basketball used in the clinching Game 6 at Boston
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   How it eluded his grasp and wound up collecting dust in a museum
may soon qualify as part of Bird lore.
</P>
<P>
   In his recent book, ``Bird Watching'' (Warner Books), written
with Sports Illustrated's Jackie MacMullan, Bird talks about how he
never realized the importance of memorabilia until later in his
career. He also has a photographic memory of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only ball I ever really wanted was in 1986, because we won
that championship by beating Bill Fitch and his Houston team, and
to me that really meant something,'' Bird wrote. ``When the game
ended, our backup center, Greg Kite, grabbed the ball, because he
was on the court and the closest one to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird went on to write that after the game he asked Kite for the
ball, but Kite would not give it to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was named the MVP of the playoffs, and I won a car for it,
and I was thinking about trading Kite the car I won for the ball,''
Bird wrote. ``But the more I thought about it, the more I felt Greg
should have just given it to me outright. I had just finished
playing a great series, and made sure he was going to have a ring.
Greg knew how much I wanted to beat Bill Fitch, because I respected
Fitch so much, and I feel he should have offered me that ball. I
never told him, but that's how I felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Kite, who has not played since 1996 and is now an assistant
coach at Seminole Community College in Orlando, said he had no idea
Bird wanted the ball that badly and could not even recall Bird's
asking him for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea he was that interested it,'' said Kite from his
Orlando home last week. ``In fact, I loaned it to Dave Cowens about
six years ago before he got back into coaching. He was working as
the curator of this sports museum and said he wanted it for
display. I don't know where it is now. It's probably on eBay
getting auctioned off or deflated in the back of someone's
closet.''
</P>
<P>
   A call placed to the Sports Museum of New England turned up the
ball. Richard Johnson, the curator, said it has recently been on
display in the Fleet Center branch of the museum, adjacent to the
Celtics' home for the last three years. ``It's a loan item, so we
intend to eventually give it back,'' Johnson said. ``But we're not
trading a car for it, no matter how much Larry wants it.''
</P>
<P>
   As proud as Bird is, he probably would not even accept the ball
today. ``But it doesn't matter now,'' he writes. ``It's done.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Kite jokingly says he regrets not making a deal at
the time with Bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would've taken a car for the thing,'' Kite said.
``My wife would. I know that. It's a great memento, but I'm not
that deeply attached to it. If Larry wants it, he can have it. If I
ever get it back, I'll trade it for one of those million-dollar,
veteran-minimum exceptions. Ask him if he needs a big-man coach.
I'll also trade it for that job.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism for Sprewell Verdict
</P>
<P>
   As the Knicks were wondering where Latrell Sprewell was and why
he did not call during his absence from training camp two weeks
ago, lawyers in his civil trial were congratulating each other over
a ``victory.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury in the Bay Area decided Sprewell's liability for causing
an auto accident that injured two people in March 1998 would cost
the Knicks guard $104,960 _ $40 less than the proposed $105,000
settlement put forth by Sprewell's lawyers before the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another side to that story, courtesy of a letter
written to The New York Times by Nancy Hurwitz Kors, who presided
as the jury forewoman in the case and has a Ph.D. in psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm writing to express my disgust with the verdict which
failed to penalize Sprewell for his conscious and willful disregard
for the safety of others,'' Hurwitz Kors wrote. ``Witnesses saw
Sprewell zigzag his Mercedes for 10 miles across four lanes at 90
miles an hour without signaling.''
</P>
<P>
   She goes on to explain how Sprewell ploughed into construction
barrels and a rail trying to get out of a right lane that became an
exit lane, eventually hitting the Toyota Corolla, which rolled over
three times.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, Irma Feliciano, 54, and Arnulfo Perlas, 55, were
not only seeking compensatory, but also punitive damages worth a
combined $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We failed to award punitive damages because the jurors did not
like one of the plaintiffs,'' Hurwitz Kors wrote, adding that if
punitive damages could have been awarded to charity or the jury
could have forced Sprewell to make a public-service, safe-driving
video, the jurors would have concluded Sprewell acted with malice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter whether he hit Mother Teresa or prisoners,''
Hurwitz Kors wrote. ``We wanted to send the message that ordinary
people will not tolerate such reckless disregard for others.
Woefully, we have a sent a message all too familiar _ if you are
rich and famous and can afford excellent attorneys, you don't have
to live by the same rules as everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Sprewell's agent, Robert Gist, for comment were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing Sprewell had driven cross-country immediately
after the verdict and missed training camp, Hurwitz Kors was even
more upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically gave him a license to whiz in and out of traffic
across America as soon as he left the courtroom,'' she said in a
telephone interview on Friday. ``That's sad.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   A Kinder, More Sensitive Riley
</P>
<P>
   Pat Riley is not reducing practice time or preparing any
differently than he has during his impressive coaching career. But
the Miami Heat president and coach has decided to take a more
sensitive approach to publicly and privately criticizing his
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always tried to deal with players on the basis of what
I think is the truth about the game and how it's played,'' he told
a group of Miami reporters last week. ``But sometimes the truth can
be a little bit too personal. If I were in that position, I may
feel offended. I respect these guys. I respect the veteran players
and the effort they put in.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments seemed to be an extension of an olive branch to Tim
Hardaway, the 33-year-old point guard, who has verbally sparred
with Riley the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway has been intimating that Riley sometimes pushes the
wrong buttons at the wrong time, taking unneeded shots and pushing
Heat players emotionally and physically to the brink. Hardaway has
also been upset that he had to settle for a mere $20-million
contract three years ago, shortly before re-establishing himself as
one of the top point guards in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway played with a sprained knee for much of last season and
was slowed in the first round of the playoffs against the Knicks.
His turbulent relationship with Riley seems to be mending, but it
could take a turn for the worse after Hardaway becomes a free agent
next summer. He is said to want a deal similar to Terrell Brandon's
six-year, $59 million pact, which may too rich for Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens with Hardaway, Riley says he is done
denigrating players for the sake of motivation. ``I want to yell
and scream as much as always,'' he said, ``but I won't say anything
personal.''

VOLUNTEERS BRIGHTEN CITY'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ian Sorkin dug a plastic knife into the brick wall,
chipping away at the cracked paint an inch at a time. All around
him, others were noisily scraping, sawing, even stabbing with their
knives because there were not enough paint scrapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only builds character,'' said Sorkin, 29, a Wall Street
trader, who was helping to repaint an outdoor mural at the Don
Pedro Albizu Campos School in Washington Heights. ``I think
everybody walks away feeling they've contributed.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 9,000 people took time away from work, sleep and their
own chores Saturday morning to spruce up 105 public schools around
New York City in what has become one of the largest volunteer days
in the region. They planted gardens and redrew lines on basketball
courts, dusted off library books, even installed Internet
connections.
</P>
<P>
   In just one day _ six hours to be exact _ they went through
11,941 paintbrushes, 5,464 gallons of paint, 3,500 pounds of rags,
10,000 pairs of latex gloves, 200 rakes, 757 hand trowels, 2,792
rolls of masking tape and 23,000 flower bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   The annual cleanup campaign was started in 1992 by New York
Cares, a nonprofit organization that recruits volunteers from
corporations, civic associations and high schools to help with
community projects. The volunteers then descend upon 100 or so
schools _ representing about 10 percent of the public school system
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York Cares organizes volunteer programs every day of the
year, but this one day is to highlight how easy it is to get
involved and make an impact,'' said Kathy Behrens, 35, executive
director of the group, which has a $2.6 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Behrens and her 30 staff members picked the schools based on
the type of work requested by each principal, the number of
volunteers needed and the location and accessibility to public
transportation. Last spring, she received about 300 applications
from principals.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer effort has received the endorsement of city
education officials: Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew sent a letter to
principals and superintendents last spring that included an
application for the cleanup campaign, and the Board of Education
donated $75,000 for the painting and cleaning supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a building looks like is very important to the children
and staff,'' said Terri Thomson, a Board of Education member who
visited several schools in Queens to thank the volunteers. ``With
limited capital dollars, it's often hard to do extras that go into
beautifying a building, and that's the role New York Cares plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's cleanup brought out teams of 10 or more volunteers
from 165 companies, including Internet firms, investment banks and
department stores.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 250 employees from Time Warner _ the most from any
single organization _ helped spread topsoil and plant shrubs and
flowers at the William H. Taft High School in the Bronx. Deutsche
Bank Americas sent 150 employees to the William Paca School in
Harlem. Several companies supplied lunches and transportation for
the cleanup day. ``There's a real sense of collective
accomplishment,'' said Rose Tobin, a Deutsche Bank executive.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the volunteers were parents or students who knew only
too well about the limited resources of some public schools. ``I've
got two kids, and they are fortunate enough to go to a school where
you don't see the litter and peeling paint,'' said Beverly
Fiorentino, 39, director of human resources for Spear, Leeds &AMP;
Kellogg, a financial services company.
</P>
<P>
   Daran Kaufman, 19, a sophomore at Barnard College, took time
away from studying for her midterms to plant flowers. ``It puts
everything in perspective when I can come and help out,'' she said.
``My life is so busy, and I basically forget about everyone else.
This makes me realize that other people need help and my problems
aren't the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their reasons, the volunteers have become part of a
beloved tradition at many public schools. At Halsey Middle School
in Brooklyn, they came last year and logged thousands of library
books into an electronic database. This year, they left behind a
mural with the school's logo _ a tiger and a locomotive _ and a
brand-new running track.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Faucetta, the school's principal, who helped serve coffee
and bagels to the volunteers, said, ``What they do in one day, I
can't do in four to six months because of the time constraints.''

RICHARD HOUGH, 77, BRITISH HISTORIAN, NOVELIST AND BIOGRAPHER OF
MOUNTBATTEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Hough, a historian and novelist whose prolific career
included books on Captain Bligh and a biography of the British war
hero Earl Mountbatten, died on Oct. 7. He was 77 and had homes in
London and Gloucestershire, England.
</P>
<P>
   Hough, the author of more than 90 books, built his reputation on
vivid retellings of naval incidents, among them the mutiny on the
Bounty, the death of Capt. James Cook and the Battle of Tsushima, a
pivotal triumph by the Japanese over the Russian fleet in 1905.
``Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian,'' his 1972 account of the Bounty
revolt, was the basis of the 1984 film ``The Bounty,'' starring
Anthony Hopkins and Mel Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   His best-known work, however, was probably the 1980 biography
``Mountbatten: Hero of Our Time,'' based on the many conversations
between Hough and Lord Mountbatten in the years before the earl was
killed in 1979 in a bombing attributed to the Irish Republican
Army.
</P>
<P>
   While researching his book on Captain Bligh, Hough traveled to
Pitcairn Island, where he met Lord Mountbatten, the beloved
great-uncle of Prince Charles. The men struck up a friendship,
which led Lord Mountbatten to commission Hough to write an
authorized biography of the lord's parents, a minor German prince,
Louis of Battenberg, and Princess Victoria, a granddaughter of
Queen Victoria. Eventually Hough asked to be considered as Lord
Mountbatten's biographer and was given his subject's approval,
although unofficially.
</P>
<P>
   A critical and popular success, the book was nonetheless
condemned by Lord Mountbatten's heirs, who took exception to the
author's declaration that his account was the book that Lord
Mountbatten ``had wanted him to write.'' Particularly unsettling to
the family, which sued to enjoin the book's publication, was
Hough's assertion that Lord Mountbatten, Britain's last viceroy of
India, knew of and condoned a ``serious relationship'' between his
wife, Edwina, and Jawaharlal Nehru, who was to become India's first
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Hough published a companion biography, ``Edwina:
Countess Mountbatten of Burma.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a banker, Hough was born in Brighton and educated at
Frensham Heights, a progressive coeducational school. His plans for
a naval career were thwarted by colorblindness; in 1941, he joined
the Royal Air Force and was assigned for training as a pilot.
Stationed in Los Angeles, he was given flying lessons by Mary
Pickford's brother, and he was soon spending weekends in the
Hollywood Hills with Ronald Colman, Joan Fontaine, Charles Boyer
and other celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   As a 21-year-old pilot, in 1943, he shot down two German fighter
bombers over the North Sea. In the autumn after the invasion of
Normandy, he flew Typhoon bombers on low-level maneuvers over the
Netherlands and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Hough began his career in publishing in 1947, writing numerous
books for boys under the pen name Bruce Carter. He also worked in

MALAYSIAN GRAND PRIX IS A MILESTONE FOR ASIA
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   First to arrive were the six jumbo jets carrying precious cargo:
the million-dollar cars, stacks of tires and digital television
equipment. Then, one by one, the big names landed: Hakkinen,
Schumacher, Coulthard, Irvine, Frentzen.
</P>
<P>
   The cast and props were all in place in Kuala Lumpur for the
Malaysian Grand Prix Sunday. And while the 350 million television
viewers might see the event as just 56 laps around a ring of black
tarmac, the race is a milestone for Malaysia, for Formula One and
for the Asian sports industry as a whole. Malaysia will become the
first country in Asia outside Japan to join the prestigious Formula
One circuit.
</P>
<P>
   For Malaysia, a successful race will be proof that a developing
nation can stage a major motor-racing event as competently as _ or
better than _ the big boys in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For Formula One, Sunday's race is a test case that may decide
the direction of the sport. Bernie Ecclestone, Formula One's chief
executive, has indicated that the Malaysian Grand Prix may be just
the beginning of other races in Asia, where countries are willing
to bend over backward to attract the millions of dollars that the
sport can pump into an economy.
</P>
<P>
   The region's trump card over Europe is clear, as Asia is
relatively free of the obstacles that frustrate Formula One
organizers in traditional markets: threats to ban tobacco
advertising, red tape and limits on noise.
</P>
<P>
   Formula One organizers have had nothing but praise for the $100
million track and facilities that Malaysia built for Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crews say they have never worked in conditions like
this,'' said a Formula One official last week amid hurried
preparations for the race. ``They've never had this much room.
Their first impressions are very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps unlikely that Formula One's foray into Southeast
Asia is taking place in a country with no strong racing culture.
But that is not really the point. Formula One is in Malaysia mostly
because the government made all the right moves to lure race
organizers, first building a world-class airport and then building
the state-of-the-art track a few miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Malaysia will be the first new country to hold a
race since Hungary in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaysian Grand Prix is the brainchild of Prime Minister
Mahathir bin Mohamad. He has been the driving force behind many of
the huge projects the country has undertaken _ the Petronas Towers,
the tallest building in the world; Malaysia's new administrative
capital, Putrajaya, one of the biggest construction projects in
Southeast Asia, and the stunning Kuala Lumpur International
Airport, the region's largest in terms of acreage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motor sports will help to put us on the world map and attract
commerce and tourists to Malaysia,'' Mahathir said Thursday at a
motor sports exhibition in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a recent study commissioned by the International
Automobile Federation, the sport's governing body, indicated that
nearly $500 million is spent each year by the spectators visiting
the 10 or 11 races in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaysian government made its first move into auto racing in
1995, when the country's national oil company, Petroliam Nasional
Bhd., or Petronas, took up sponsorship of the Sauber Formula One
team. A year later, Malaysia became the first government to sponsor
a Formula One team in a $10.7 million, two-year deal with Jackie
Stewart's new team. The sponsorship, which was canceled after one
year because of the regional economic crisis, included a ``Visit
Malaysia'' logo on the team car.
</P>
<P>
   But before the crisis set in, Malaysia had struck a deal with
Formula One to hold a race in Asia, beating out several other Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
   China was to be the first new Asian race, and was on the 1999
schedule until it was removed because of logistical problems.
Singapore and Indonesia bid for the race at the same time as
Malaysia. India and South Korea have recently shown interest.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir appointed Basir Ismail, the chairman of Malaysia
Airports Bhd., the company charged with managing the country's
airports, to carry out the negotiations with Formula One.
</P>
<P>
   The 5.542-kilometer Malaysian track, which features 15 turns and
eight straightaways, is the world's widest, at an average of 52.5
feet across. That design, race organizers say, promises an exciting
race with constant passing. Some 70 percent of the track is visible
to spectators in what is the sport's longest grandstand, a
structure seating 30,000. The grandstand's large roof canopies were
designed to block out the tropical sun.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's climate may pose an added challenge for drivers
Sunday. Mika Hakkinen of the McLaren team, who visited the track in
March, said the cars would suffer more and be more susceptible to
breakdowns. The Malaysian capital's frequent rain showers also
could be problematic. Races in Europe are rarely stopped for rain,
but, said Hermann Tilke, the track's German designer, ``if a
monsoon comes, the race has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilke designed the track to clear water within 25 minutes, but
some Malaysians think rain could wipe out the race entirely. While
the weather is out of their control, race organizers say they have
solved one potential problem: attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers had worried that the race could face the same woes as
a Grand Prix motorcycle event staged by Malaysia in April. Crowd
turnout was poor, and the series will not return next year. To
prevent those attendance problems, Ecclestone installed a Frenchman
with Formula One experience, Philippe Gurdjian, to promote the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, for his part, has been marketing the product locally.
Last week was declared National Motor Sports Week in Malaysia.
While there appeared to be relatively few spectators in the
grandstands during practice sessions Friday, organizers say they
have sold 65,000 tickets and are expecting crowds of 80,000 to
100,000 people Sunday. If the weather holds up, the fans may be in
for a good show: Sunday's race could decide who wins this year's
Formula One championship.
</P>
<P>
   While it did not rain during the Friday practice sessions, the
sky was cloudy and the track was wet for at least half of the two
one-hour sessions. Jacques Villeneuve set the fastest time in
practice. ``It's a very simple track to drive on,'' he said. ``It's
fun.'' &QL;

 WILLIAM GOTTLIEB, 64, INVESTOR IN REAL ESTATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Gottlieb, a real estate investor who was
believed to be one of the largest owners of property in the West
Village of Manhattan, died Oct. 5, according to The Villager, a
neighborhood newspaper. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
   He had recently suffered a stroke, said William Shutkind, an
engineer who worked with him.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three decades, Gottlieb bought more than 100
properties, many in the meat market area and in the far West
Village. They were worth $200 million to $300 million, Shutkind
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb also owned property on the Lower East Side and several
restaurants in Greenwich Village, Shutkind said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very mysterious person, very unusual,'' Shutkind
said. ``Nobody seemed to know him. He drove a car with the windows
knocked out. He dressed very casually. He was very wealthy, but you
would never know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among people in the real estate business, Gottlieb was unusual
because he apparently neither sold any of his properties nor
converted them into cooperative apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Warwick, a real estate agent in Greenwich Village, said
Gottlieb had a penchant for thrift. He was known for not
rehabilitating his properties beyond making them habitable and
applying a fresh coat of paint. He inadvertently became a leading
preservationist in the Village simply by not tearing down or
changing his buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Shutkind said Gottlieb recently bought an old meat factory
building on 10th Avenue, running from West 13th Street to West 14th
Street; he had planned to turn it into apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked into the future and figured it was a hot area, and
it is,'' Shutkind said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Gottlieb had the foresight to buy buildings in
the far West Village along Hudson Street and Eighth Avenue, then a
marginal area but now much more desirable, Shutkind said.
</P>
<P>
   His death has set off conjectures that many of his holdings may
now be sold. ``No one knows whether there is or isn't a will,''
Shutkind said. ``They are still looking for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Gottlieb's closest survivor was a sister. A phone call
to her was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Some preservationists say they fear that developers may buy the
properties, many of which are vacant, for demolition.

BUILDERS PRESS ON IN COW COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MITCH MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAUKESHA, Wis. _ John Gehl has begun doing something this fall
that hasn't been done in a long time in Waukesha County: He has his
cows producing milk on a new dairy farm.
</P>
<P>
   Gehl, who also owns a dairy, bought land for the farm in the
town of Merton over a period of several years, and this year it
went into operation. ``Everybody says it can't be done _ well,
that's nonsense,'' he said. ``We need to get smart about our
farmland. It's incredible that we are just chopping it all up like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gehl is going decidedly against the grain. The 580-square-mile
county, once called ``Cow County, U.S.A.'' because people traveled
here from across the nation to buy the finest blooded cow stock, it
has experienced rapid development that has left it with only 67
scattered dairy farms.
</P>
<P>
   The county lies directly in the path of growth west of
Milwaukee. Its 1999 estimated population of 353,000 compared with a
population of only 304,000 in 1990. About 5,000 people are moving
into the county every year, said Daniel Finley, the county
executive.
</P>
<P>
   In and around the city of Waukesha, the county seat, large new
homes that sell for about $275,000 to $400,000 line the glacial
ridges of the countryside. Within about two miles of Gehl's farm,
James Siepmann is building a subdivision and selling homes in that
price range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had about as strong a market as you could hope for since
1992,'' said Siepmann, who developed the land for a project called
Still Meadow, where home builders built and sold 85 houses over a
two-and-a-half-year period that ended last year. Now home builders
have started construction a new site called Summer Hill, which
Siepmann developed nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The growth rate has pushed up property values steadily in the
1990s. In 1986, the average selling price was $90,176. By 1996,
that number had risen to $178,508, according to the Milwaukee
Metropolitan Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   The county now has the second-highest property value total in
the state. With $27 billion in property values, it rivals Milwaukee
County's $36 billion with only a little more than a third of
Milwaukee County's population.
</P>
<P>
   Rising property values to a large extent have given the few
remaining dairy farmers a choice of paying higher taxes for the
marginal profits of the dairy business, or accepting a fat check to
hand the family farm over to developers. ``There's an old joke that
the best cash crop the farmers raise around here is the
subdivision,'' said Lindsey, the county executive.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, elsewhere in the county, some of the dairy farmers
are hanging on and adapting. West of Big Bend is a 400-acre farm
owned by the Bartholomew family.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bartholomew says he is one of only five dairy-farm
families left in Vernon Township. His son Dan recently agreed to
take over the family dairy herd of 130 cows, and another son,
David, helps with the field crops. But a third son, Mike, drives a
gravel truck because there is not enough farmland left to rent to
provide work for the four of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some really strong farm families around here, and
that family thing is the only thing that keeps it going,'' said
Robert Bartholomew.
</P>
<P>
   Bartholomew said many of the farmers who have hung on adapt
their operations. Some former dairymen have become dairy cow
breeders, raising cows that actually produce milk on larger farms
far from the Milwaukee metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Brown's farmhouse in the town of Merton is now completely
surrounded by development. From a long line of dairymen, he now
only raises beef cattle and runs a nursery.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I lose in farming, I make up for in selling silver maples
to the new subdivisions,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one dairy farmer has adapted completely, going from
farmer to developer. Robert Klein and his wife, Maria, survived
World War II and the Soviet occupation of German-speaking Poland
before immigrating first to West Germany and then to southeastern
Waukesha County. The Kleins tended a 160-acre dairy and beef herd
outside Big Bend for some 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now Klein has become the embodiment of the real estate trends in
the county as a former dairy farmer, current developer and
resident.
</P>
<P>
   His old barn and silo are on one of 20 lots he has subdivided
from his old pastureland. On one of the other five lots rests his
new three-bedroom home, nestled into the side of a hill. The Kleins
now live on the newly minted Kunzendorf Street, named after the
hamlet where the two met as children.
</P>
<P>
   The old barn remains because one of his customers decided he
needed something to house a collection of antique cars. Klein is as
good a real estate salesman as he was a farmer: Only four of the
available 20 lots remain.
</P>
<P>
   He is unromantic about his old occupation. ``I am too worn out.
That is a young man's job,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   Siepmann, the developer, said most typical new homes in Waukesha
County were being sold to business executives, medical
professionals and well-paid salespeople. Many of his new homes run
from 4,000 to even 6,000 square feet and sell for up to $700,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Siepmann is at the head of a development trend only now becoming
popular in Waukesha County in which the cookie-cutter subdivisions
are rejected in favor of cluster development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of the three- to five-acre estate, we put homes on a
half or three-quarters of an acre and then that added land is open
space such as a meadow or a recreational area,'' Siepmann said.
``It's good for the environment, it's good for the community and
anyway these are busy people. They don't want to spend all Saturday
on a lawn tractor.''
</P>
<P>
   Siepmann creates subdivisions made up of large homes nestled
into the tops of the glacial ridges overlooking large meadows and
ponds. He said five years ago it was difficult to overcome the
Midwestern predilection for flat, uniform subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now slopes are very big,'' he said. ``Nine out of the 10
people that come through my door want a slope.''
</P>
<P>
   The developer predicted that his new home sales in 1999 would
not quite meet 1998 figures, but that the market will remains very
active.
</P>
<P>
   He considers a 20 percent pre-construction sales rate to be
healthy and believes he will run at 50 percent for the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
   Siepmann said the real development challenges would begin in the
next decade, when he believes much of the best land will have been
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Before that happens the county board is trying to save some of
the land for future generations. One proposal that Lindsey believes
has broad support among county board members would have the county
spend $1 million a year to preserve parks and open land. Much of
the money would be raised through property taxes, but a fourth
would come from the county's three public golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a sizable portion of the land is reserved for open
space, Waukesha County will be a far different place from the dairy
land at the beginning of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Waukesha was called ``Cow County, U.S.A.'' because it was said
to have more purebred dairy cows per square mile than any other
county in the United States _ and more Guernsey cattle than the
island of Guernsey. A special 1915 edition of the local newspaper,
the Freeman, devoted a page to a national champion Ayrshire cow,
the Kilnfort Bell III, calling her ``Queen of All the Ayrshires,
Mistress of All Dairy Shows.''
</P>
<P>
   After the cow's 1914 victory at the International Dairy Show in
Chicago, the newspaper wrote, ``She stands today with the highest
honors possible for a cow to receive, from the most important
gathering of dairy animals in our history.''

 PENN STATE'S McCOO PLOWS DOWN OHIO STATE  
(lb) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ One quarterback was lost, two short field
goals were blocked and Penn State had to settle for three points
after pounding the ball inside the Ohio State 25-yard line on three
other occasions. But while it may have not been a great afternoon
for the unbeaten Nittany Lions, they escaped with a 23-10 victory
over the Buckeyes _ because Eric McCoo did have a terrific day.
</P>
<P>
   Time after time, McCoo, a sophomore tailback from Red Bank,
N.J., churned for tough Penn State yards that kept an exhausted but
still swarming Ohio State defense on the field for too long.
</P>
<P>
   McCoo gained 211 yards on 22 carries, including a 53-yard burn
up the middle of the field on the game's opening drive. But McCoo's
hardest-nosed running came in the fourth quarter when he turned a
desperate dump pass from Rashard Casey into a bruising and
improbable 16-yard first down.
</P>
<P>
   Clinging to a 20-10 lead and facing a third-down-and-15 at the
Ohio State 40-yard line, Casey sidestepped a blistering Buckeye
blitz and dumped the ball to McCoo just over the line of scrimmage.
He started left and eluded one defender with a hurdle kick, banged
through two more Buckeyes 5 yards later and carried another pair of
defenders on his back for the final 4 yards to the Ohio State 19
and a first down.
</P>
<P>
   The 97,007 at Beaver Stadium rose to roar for his effort. It
meant Travis Forney was close enough to kick his third field goal
of the afternoon, a 28-yarder. It meant Penn State, No. 3 in the
New York Times computer ranking, improved to 7-0. Ohio State fell
to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   McCoo's running also took the pressure off Casey, a junior
quarterback who led the Nittany Lions to 10 second-half points
after they lost the starter Kevin Thompson and, it appeared,
perhaps some momentum, on a painful sack and fumble near the end of
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   So with Thompson out for the second half with an injury to his
right shoulder, Casey was in total control of the offense. He
opened the half with a seven-play, 61-yard drive that he kept alive
with a 12-yard rocket to Bryant Johnson and a feathery swing pass
to Mike Cerimele that the big fullback took 20 yards down to the
Ohio State 5.
</P>
<P>
   Then he did what every one knows he can do: run. He took a
bootleg left and skittered in for a touchdown and Penn State's
20-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Each coach had brought his team into this Big Ten rivalry with
an agitated mind-set. Penn State's Joe Paterno isolated his players
from the news media, complained that they were getting too much
attention and declared them tired. Ohio State's John Cooper angered
his players by saying that the Nittany Lions were a superior squad
and the Buckeyes needed Penn State to play poorly to have the
slightest chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions hardly looked like a tired team, however, in
dominating the first half. Statistically, they outgained the
Buckeyes, 238 yards to 71, but Penn State clung to a 13-10 halftime
lead after having to settle for two field goals despite driving
inside the Buckeye 25.
</P>
<P>
   And late in the second quarter, after Thompson lost a fumble for
a touchdown when the Buckeyes sacked him and knocked him out of the
game with a shoulder injury, the Nittany Lions appeared to be in
the type of brawl they had lost four of the last six times they
faced Ohio State in Big Ten play.
</P>
<P>
   On the play in which he was hurt, Thompson took a quick drop
into his end zone on third down and 10 on the Penn State six, but
the Butkus Award candidate Na'il Diggs as the nation's best
linebacker got there quicker. He blindsided the quarterback _ one
of four first-half sacks for the Buckeyes _ and knocked the ball
loose, and safety Gary Berry pounced on it to cut the lead to
13-10.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State had started Saturday's game confidently, with McCoo
energized by the prospect of facing a Buckeye defense porous enough
to give up 398 yards a game. McCoo began on the opening series and
galloped for 126 first-half yards. On the game's first play, the
sophomore tailback took a swing pass from Thompson down the left
sideline for 20 yards before being tripped up.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays after McCoo's 53-yard gain, Thompson tossed a crossing
route to Cerimele on the goal line and the Nittany Lions were up,
7-0.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Cooper had warned his team that they couldn't make
mistakes against the Penn State defense, his offense lost the ball
three times in their first six plays. On first-and-10 at the Ohio
State 32, Courtney Brown chased Buckeye quarterback Steve Bellisari
from the pocket and knocked the ball loose for Nittany Lion
linebacker Brandon Short to smother on the 20-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes escaped a bigger early hole, however, when Jason
Ott blocked Forney's 39-yard field-goal attempt. But Bellisari, who
fumbled two more snaps, redeemed himself when he scrambled 44 yards
to the Nittany Lion 37. The run set up a 47-yard field goal by Dan
Stultz that barely cleared the cross bar to cut the Penn State lead
to 7-3.

PENN HAS THE TEAMS TO BEAT IN IVY LEAGUE PREDICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to news-media pundits, this will not be the year of
the Tigers. Try the season of the Quakers.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Pennsylvania's women's and men's basketball
teams, the Quakers, are the favorites to win the Ivy League
basketball championships this season, based on polls released last
week. The Princeton Tigers, the perennial penthouse dwellers among
the men's and women's teams in the last two seasons, were picked
second.
</P>
<P>
   The Penn men won the Ivy title last year with a 13-1 record and
finished 21-6 overall. Penn will be led by a talented backcourt of
Michael Jordan, a fourth-year starter and two-time first-team
all-Ivy selection, and Matt Langel, a senior and honorable-mention
all-Ivy selection last year. Returning at center is Geoff Owens,
who led the team in both blocked shots (2.8 a game) and rebounds
(7.8 a game).
</P>
<P>
   Coach Fran Dunphy, whose 173-97 career record is third-best in
Penn history, said that if his team is to live up to expectations,
it will have to overcome the loss of forward Paul Romanczuk, who
shot 60.1 percent last year, the third-highest single-season mark
in Quaker history, and forward Jed Ryan, who finished his career
with 152 three-point field goals, fourth-highest in Quaker history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two great players and two great leaders,'' said Dunphy during
the Ivy League media day at the New York Marriott Financial Center
last Wednesday. ``Although we have six freshmen, this is one of our
deepest teams ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn's women's team, which finished third in the league last
season, edged out the 1999 co-champion, Princeton, in the preseason
voting with 114 points to the Tiger's 113. Penn forward Diana
Caramanico, the Ivy League player of the year and the team's
leading scorer with an average of 22.7 points a game and rebounder
(12.2), will be playing under the new coach, Kelly Greenberg, who
seemed surprised that her team was picked No. 1 in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said to someone, `If we're picked first I think I'm
going to die,''' Greenberg said. ``I'm going to really think about
how this is going to affect our team. Just because we have a couple
of girls who can play returning doesn't mean we're going to win. We
had those two girls last year and we didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's and women's teams from Columbia were chosen to finish
last in the eight-team league after finishing sixth and eighth,
respectively, last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions' men's coach, Armond Hill, will start five
underclassmen and said his team will have to overcome ``youthful
inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Butler, coach of the Lions' women's team, will have three
senior starters, led by forward Catherine Tubridy, and a promising
third-year post player in Shawnee Pickney, who was an honorable
mention all-Ivy selection last season.
</P>
<P>
   Pickney did not seem phased by her team's last-place
designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let others dictate we're the worse,'' Pickney said.
``Just because we're overshadowed, doesn't mean we're not talented
or well-rounded players. Before, it was a joke to play Columbia.
Now, teams that play us, leave the court knowing we played a
heartfelt 40 minutes.''

REAL ESTATE: HOW TO COMBAT THE BAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Wis.)  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Are there bats in your belfry? Don't have a belfry?
Well, then, how about your attic?
</P>
<P>
   ``As the weather gets colder, many bats move south,'' said
Michael Deutsch, chief entomologist for Allied Pioneer Pest
Management, a pest control company in Manhattan. ``But there are
always going to be some bats that will stick around and take up
winter residence in a nice warm attic.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, having bats in one's attic is more common than
most people think. That is because bats themselves are more common
than most people think. According to Bat Conservation
International, a bat advocacy group in Austin, Texas, the 1,000 or
so different species of bats account for nearly one-quarter of
mammal species.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 1.5 million of them under a bridge here in Austin,''
said Bob Benson, public information manager for the conservation
organization. ``It's a big tourist attraction. And they come back
every year like clockwork.'' ``They,'' of course, are the bats, not
the tourists. ``They're incredibly intelligent animals,'' he said.
``They always come back to the same roost.''
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the problem if the roost is under your roof:
Bats that have taken up residence in your house are likely to
return there after heading south for the winter _ if, that is, they
decide to leave in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people who have bats in their homes right now
and don't even know it,'' Benson said, explaining that since bats
are quiet, spend most of the day sleeping upside down and have
about as much use for humans as we have for them, they are
generally rather inconspicuous house guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are even some people who know they have bats in the
attic or the soffits but don't mind that they're there,'' he said,
explaining that since small bats can consume 600 or more
mosquito-sized insects every hour, some homeowners consider the
nocturnal predators natural pest-control devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a difference between bats in an unused attic and
bats in the living quarters,'' Benson said. ``And we strongly
recommend that you safely exclude bats that get into the living
quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Most homeowners, of course, would rather avoid dealing with that
eventuality by keeping bats out of the house entirely. But how?
``Bat-proofing by exclusion is the only proper technique,'' Benson
said, explaining that the only way to keep them out of, say, your
bedroom, is to keep them out of the house in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to find the points of entry and then you have to
install a one-way valve so the bats inside can get out but the bats
outside can't get in,'' he said, adding that finding points of
entry could be difficult since bats can squeeze through openings as
small as 3/8 by 7/8 of an inch. ``That's a really tiny hole,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bishop, the owner of American Wildlife Control in
Evansville, Wis., and founder of Bat Busters, a fledgling
organization of pest-control experts who specialize in helping
homeowners keep bats at bay, said that to expertly bat-proof a
house, ``you have to think in terms of a matchbook'' to locate
every potential bat portal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to find every conceivable gap, separation, crack or
crevice that you can slip a matchbook into,'' Bishop said. ``And
then you have to determine where the primary exit points are.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that one way to identify primary exit points is to
look for ``elongated bat droppings stuck to the side of the
house.'' Another, he said, is to wait outside the house at dusk and
watch for bats to emerge, paying special attention to areas where
chimneys run along the side of the house or through roofs and
soffits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep thinking in terms of a matchbook,'' Bishop said, adding
that once the primary exit points have been identified, all other
openings should be permanently sealed. Then, he said, one-way
``bat-excluders'' should be affixed to the primary exit points.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can climb a ladder,'' he said, ``you can bat-proof your
house.'' And while most bat-exclusion experts have developed their
own custom-made one-way excluders (Bishop sells a bat-proofing kit
for $125 on his Internet Web site, www.batbusters.com), homeowners
can usually craft a perfectly serviceable exclusion device from
materials found at a local garden center.
</P>
<P>
   According to an article in Bat Conservation International's
monthly newsletter, Bats, a basic bat-exclusion device can be
constructed out of a piece of polypropylene bird netting and some
tape or staples.
</P>
<P>
   Once the primary exit points have been identified, the article
instructs, the netting _ which should be cut large enough to extend
several inches above, below and to each side of the bat hole _
should be secured with tape or staples above the top of the hole.
Affixed in this way, the article continues, the netting acts as a
one-way valve, allowing bats to exit but not enter.
</P>
<P>
   In a few days _ after the absence of activity makes it clear
that the bats have been evicted _ the netting can be removed and
the holes sealed permanently. (It is important, the article points
out, to avoid installing one-way bat valves in June or July, the
time of the year when flightless young may be present.)
</P>
<P>
   ``After you have successfully bat-proofed your home, we suggest
providing an alternative habitat for the bats,'' said Benson, Bat
Conservation's spokesman. ``If you offer them a house that meets
their requirements, there's less of a chance they'll try to get
back into your house.''
</P>
<P>
   (Do-it-yourself plans for simple bat houses and homemade one-way
bat valves can be obtained from the conservation organization at
(800) 538-2287. Other information is available on the group's Web
site, www.batcon.org.)
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, evicting bats is not necessarily the last step in
eliminating a bat problem. ``Getting rid of the bats is the easy
part,'' said Deutsch, the entomologist. ``But once the bats are out
and everything is sealed up, the cleanup that follows may not be
something you want to tackle yourself. Don't forget, these animals
eat hundreds and hundreds of insects every night.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Deutsch said, any sizable amount of bat guano left
behind by the departing critters should be cleaned by a
professional wearing a respirator with a HEPA filter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bat guano is not something you want to be breathing,'' he
said, explaining that ingesting or inhaling dried bat waste can
cause serious respiratory infections. Moreover, he said, anywhere
that bats were present should also be treated with pesticides after
the bats are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bats do carry fleas, ticks, lice and bedbugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Deutsch said, bats encountered in the living area of a
house should be dealt with cautiously. Generally speaking, he said,
opening a window or door to the outside should be enough to
encourage the bat to make a hasty exit. ``A bat isn't going to come
after you for no reason,'' Deutsch said. ``But if a bat gets
stressed enough, it could bite.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson said that while getting rabies from a bat bite is
possible, it is not likely. ``In a wild population of bats, less
than one-half of one percent contract the virus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Health Department, however, has found that 3
percent to 4 percent of the bats tested in the state have rabies.
Claire Pospisil, a department spokeswoman, said that anyone who has
had physical contact with a bat should try to capture the animal so
it can be tested for rabies. That can be done, she said, by closing
windows and doors and waiting for the bat to land.
</P>
<P>
   When it does, a person wearing gloves should cover the bat with
a coffee can, slide a piece of cardboard underneath and take the
bat to the local health department for testing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pospisil added that since it is possible for a person to be
bitten or scratched without knowing it, the same steps should be
taken if a bat is found in a room with a sleeping person, an
unattended child or a person with a mental impairment.
</P>
<P>
   If the bat cannot be captured, Ms. Pospisil said, the department
recommends rabies shots.

KILLING SAID TO BE REVENGE FOR DAUGHTER OF MOB FIGURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a September afternoon more than eight years ago,
Vincent Bickelman was found dead, shot six times while on the lawn
in front of his Bath Beach home, in what police described at the
time as a mysterious killing.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday law enforcement officials said they believed that
Bickelman's fatal mistake came a month earlier when he burglarized
the Brooklyn home of Jill Spero, the daughter of a man the
authorities say later became the leader of the Bonanno crime
family.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, her father, Anthony Spero, 70, was charged with
conspiracy to commit murder in the killing of Bickelman, whom the
police believed had taken jewelry and other valuables from Ms.
Spero's home.
</P>
<P>
   The federal indictment of Spero, two other alleged members of
the Bonanno crime family and 12 other people accused of being
associates of the organization, was announced on Friday by Loretta
E. Lynch, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment and another filed in May charged that members and
associates of the crime family, which operated primarily in the Bay
Ridge and Bensonhurst sections of Brooklyn, had orchestrated dozens
of robberies, arsons, murders and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's indictment also charged two men, James Calandra and
Thomas Reynolds, with the 1993 killing of a 46-year-old Staten
Island woman.
</P>
<P>
   On a cold February morning after the woman, Judith Shemtov, had
a cup of tea with her husband, she answered the front door of their
Staten Island home and was fatally shot in the head, law
enforcement officials said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman fired one bullet into Mrs. Shemtov's head and then
fled, said Detective Joe Pentangelo, a police spokesman. Mrs.
Shemtov was found by her husband, Sam, in the foyer of their home.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, detectives said they had no suspects or motives in
the slaying of Mrs. Shemtov, who lived in the cloistered Richmond
Valley neighborhood of $500,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Calandra, 29, and Reynolds, 69, were charged in the federal
indictment last week with shooting Mrs. Shemtov in a foiled robbery
attempt. The couple kept valuables in a safe within their home,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds was arrested in federal prison, where he was awaiting
trial on other charges, and Calandra was arrested at his Staten
Island home, officials said. Pentangelo said that the police were
still looking for additional suspects who may have taken part in
the robbery attempt.

A WORLD RECORD HOLDER OVERCOMES THE CHALLENGES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clarinda Brueck was told that when she was born without a left
forearm and hand, her mother went into mourning for three months.
Then she snapped out of it and took her infant daughter to Dr.
Henry H. Kessler, who founded the Kessler Institute for
Rehabilitation in West Orange, N.J., which specializes in the
treatment of people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Brueck, 44, is preparing to compete in her third
consecutive Ironman Triathlon on Saturday as the world record
holder in the physically challenged division.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, she became the first disabled woman to finish the
Ironman, which consists of 2.4 miles of swimming, 112 miles of
cycling and 26.2 miles of running. One year later, competing
alongside able-bodied athletes, she finished in a division-record
16 hours 36 minutes 16 seconds, 10 minutes faster than her previous
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Brueck, who founded the physically
challenged international division for triathletes, received the
Kessler Dignity award at a gala celebration at the Marriott Marquis
Hotel in Manhattan. Previous recipients have been actor Christopher
Reeve, who was treated at Kessler after he was paralyzed in a horse
riding accident in 1995, and entertainer Ben Vereen, who sought
treatment at the institute for head injuries suffered in 1996 when
he was struck by a car while walking near his Los Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   Brueck, a physical education teacher at a public school in her
hometown of Fairview, N.J., said last week that she was honored to
be given an award dedicated to ``the man who helped me become who I
am today.'' Dr. Kessler died in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived his beliefs and his vision,'' said Brueck. ``What's so
ironic is that when my mother was 17 she was hurt in a car accident
and went to Dr. Kessler for treatment. Fifteen years later, she
took me to him. And now, my cousin is being treated at the
institute. That's three generations.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brueck began competing nine years ago, the institute
developed a prosthetic arm for her to use during bicycle races.
``But it was clunky and hard to control,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the institute built a myo-electric arm, which relies on
electrical impulses from her muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped increase my speed, but it weighs five pounds and if
you use it a lot, the battery runs out,'' she explained. ``Still,
there are so many wonderful things happening out there and so much
more to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Brueck will begin this year's Ironman competition in Kona,
Hawaii, with visions from a dream dancing in her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last July, I dreamed I was running down Alii Drive in Kona
coming into the finish chute and I see the clock,'' she recalled.
``It said 15:27:21.''

 &HT;    School prayer taken to task
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that the
state cannot sponsor prayer at school.
</P>
<P>
   But what if school boards allow students to decide by majority
vote whether to have religious observances during graduation
ceremonies? Is that excessive, unconstitutional state involvement?
Or is it the proper separation of church and state that the
Constitution calls for?
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court in Atlanta will hear arguments on the
issue Tuesday. The court's decision, not expected for months, will
determine whether prayer can return to commencement ceremonies in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The case highlights the classic problem caused by two First
Amendment clauses: the clause that guarantees free speech and the
so-called establishment clause, which has been interpreted to set
up a wall of separation between church and state. The establishment
clause is a legal doctrine that the Supreme Court has found
increasingly difficult to define.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction
over Georgia, Alabama and Florida, will consider a policy adopted
by the Duval County, Fla., school district in 1993 that allows
students to elect from among their ranks a speaker to deliver a
two-minute commencement ``message.'' The message cannot be reviewed
or edited by school officials.
</P>
<P>
   At some schools, students have voted for a class ``chaplain'' to
deliver the message. Students seeking election as graduation
speakers were allowed to outline their topic, and some campaigned
to have prayer at graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Since the policy's adoption, religious observances have
dominated the messages in the form of prayers, invocations and
benedictions, according to court motions filed by opponents of the
policy. The plaintiffs include high school seniors and students who
have yet to reach high school age.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a three-judge panel of the court found the Duval policy
unconstitutional. But that decision was vacated and the entire
court now will hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   Emory University Professor Marci Hamilton said the Duval County
case gives the court a rare opportunity to better define the legal
boundaries for school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the mere intervention of student election satisfy the
establishment clause?'' she asked. ``Does the audience perceive
itself to be there involuntarily? Is this a sleight of hand by the
school board to gets its own religious message across? It's a close
case. It won't be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia school officials are eager for guidance. If the 11th
Circuit Court permits high school seniors to vote for prayer at
graduation, many school districts in the state are certain to allow
it, said Sam Harben, general counsel of the Georgia School Board
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The case is the latest in more than three decades of litigation
over public school prayer. Civil libertarians have consistently
asserted that prayer has no place in public schools. Supporters
have tried to introduce prayer at football games, over school
intercoms and during graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a
commencement program in Providence, R.I., in which a principal
invited clergy to deliver a nonsectarian benediction.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for a 5-4 majority,
was that the program was planned and directed by a state official.
Because attendance was ``in a fair and real sense'' compulsory,
Kennedy wrote, the state ``psychologically coerced'' graduates to
participate in a religious exercise.
</P>
<P>
   After the court's decision, Duval's school board ordered an end
to prayers at graduation. But the school system was soon bombarded
with proposals on how to continue prayer.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the school system circulated a memorandum entitled
``Graduation Prayers,'' laying out the current policy.
</P>
<P>
   It was soon challenged by a federal lawsuit in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Adler, whose daughter was the lead plaintiff, said the
board wanted to perpetuate majority rule on prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be about respecting everybody's beliefs, no matter
what you are,'' Adler said in a recent interview. ``This policy
doesn't do that. I am appalled it is so uninclusive. Here we are at
graduation to celebrate everyone's accomplishment, but some people
are completely excluded.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler said her daughter paid a price for joining the lawsuit: At
school, she was ridiculed, intimidated and shunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids actually think religious liberty can be put to a
vote,'' she added. ``How do they have the audacity? In your heart,
you think they would respect everyone, even the minority.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler said she and her family are fully supportive of prayer in
schools, provided that it's done by students privately. ``We're not
anti-prayer,'' she said. ``That's not it at all. It's just that
anybody would object to having a prayer forced upon them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jay Sekulow, counsel for the American Center for Law and
Justice, said students have religious speech rights just like
everyone else. The state cannot strip them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to conceive of a policy that more perfectly
achieves government neutrality toward religion than does the school
board's policy,'' said Sekulow, who filed friend-of-the-court
briefs in support of Duval County. ``This is a case where ... the
designated speakers of the class can talk about whatever they want.
It can be a word of protest on something. If the student wants to
pray, that's up to the student.''
</P>
<P>
   Sekulow dismisses arguments criticizing prayer by majority rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are students who are graduating high school, who are
going to invite or are going to experience speech they disagree
with,'' he said. ``That's the price of freedom. If they haven't
learned it by the time they're seniors in high school at 18 years
of age, then it's time that they do learn it.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, a panel of three judges on the 11th Circuit sided with
Adler. In a 2-1 decision, the court found Duval's policy
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state's control over nearly all aspects of the graduation
ceremony, and the choices of a student-elected representative,
subjects the ceremony to the limits of the Constitution,'' Judge
Joseph Hatchett wrote. He also suggested that ``reasonable''
students will not realize that student-elected prayer messages are
divorced from state sponsorship. Senior Judge Phyllis Kravitch
concurred. ``One need not be clairvoyant to predict that prayer is
the most natural `message' this format is likely to produce,'' she
said. ``A prayer from the lips of a popularly elected student
representative is far more likely to coerce audience participation
than one from a member of the clergy selected by the school
principal.'' In dissent, Judge Stanley Marcus said the court ``has
come perilously close to pronouncing an absolute rule that would
excise all private religious expression from a public graduation
ceremony, no matter how neutral the process of selecting the
speaker may have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus added that the court's duty is not to purge graduation
ceremonies of all prayer. Instead, it must protect a student's
private message, which may be religious in nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most notably for me, if the graduating class chooses to have a
message, the content of the message shall be prepared by the
student speaker alone and no one else,'' he said. ``I cannot
conceive of how a message delivered by a student under these
circumstances can be characterized as the state's message.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus' reasoning apparently persuaded others on the 12-member
court. A month later, the Duval County ruling was vacated. The
entire court will hear arguments on the issue Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of school prayer see this development as a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   They also can look to another 11th Circuit decision, issued in
July, to bolster their spirits. In an Alabama case, a separate
three-judge panel ruled unanimously that schools cannot prohibit
nonsectarian, nonproselytizing student prayer at school functions.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution ``probably does not require a `wall''' of
separation between church and state, the court said. ```Cleansing'
our public schools of all religious expression ... inevitably
results in the 'establishment' of disbelief _ atheism _ as the
state's religion.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Will justice ever come in the killing of JonBenet
Ramsey?
</P>
<P>
   After a three-year investigation that cost $2 million and a
13-month grand jury probe that came up empty-handed, is there even
hope?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not over,'' JonBenet's aunt, Pam Paugh, insisted late
last week. ``My niece lies in the ground in Marietta. This is not
over.''
</P>
<P>
   But as with everything else in the JonBenet mystery, opinions
differ, and some experts insist bringing the little girl's killer
to punishment remains a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Immediate prospects for a resolution were dashed last week when
a grand jury was dismissed without issuing indictments and
prosecutors said they lacked evidence strong enough to proceed
against anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end of the road,'' said William Pizzi, a
University of Colorado law professor who has watched the
investigation closely.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet's slaying may endure as a high-profile example of how
justice does not always prevail. Of homicides committed in 1997,
more than 6,000 _ a third of the national total _ have not resulted
in arrests, the FBI says.
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Gwinnett County, for example, 50 homicides since
1969 are still considered mysteries. Only one of those unsolved
killings brought an indictment, and the accused was acquitted in
1989 _ 15 years after the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``every case is solvable,'' said noted evidence expert
Dr. Henry Lee, a consultant in the JonBenet and O.J. Simpson cases.
</P>
<P>
   POLICE REMAIN OPTIMISTIC
</P>
<P>
   Lee and others see advancements in forensic science unlocking
the mysteries of evidence left at the murder scene. Or perhaps
somebody, years from now, will spill secrets in an unguarded
moment. A coin dropped in a pay phone, an anonymous tip, could lead
to an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was far from a perfect murder,'' said Craig Silverman, a
former Denver prosecutor. ``The killer left all sorts of clues.
They just need to put the pieces together.''
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-old JonBenet Ramsey was found dead in her family's
Boulder, Colo., home Dec. 26, 1996. Investigators identified her
parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, as being under suspicion, but no
arrest was ever made.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys now live in metro Atlanta, where JonBenet was born
and where she is buried.
</P>
<P>
   The police in Boulder have come under harsh criticism for
upsetting the crime scene when they allowed the girl's father to
search the home. But even though many crime scenes are compromised,
Silverman contends, that doesn't stand in the way of putting
someone behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paramedics rush in and perform procedures on a person to see
if they are completely dead,'' said Silverman, now a criminal
defense attorney. ``They cut open the person's shirt; they cut open
the person's chest. But that doesn't mean the crime scene is
irrevocably tainted.'' Fresh eyes may yet find what others might
have missed. Colorado Gov. Bill Owens said Thursday he might soon
appoint a special investigator to pursue the case.
</P>
<P>
   And Boulder Police Chief Mark Beckner said some evidence has yet
to be reviewed. ``This case is not dead in the water,'' Beckner
said. But, he acknowledged, ``there's not all that much to do.''
</P>
<P>
   `YOU JUST KEEP POKING AWAY'
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet's family is angry because of what it considers a
failure by investigators to pursue other possible suspects strongly
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very, very significant leads out there, and I'm
not convinced that they have been pursued,'' said Jeff Ramsey of
metro Atlanta, brother of JonBenet's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be investigated properly by people who know what
they're doing,'' said Paugh, a Dunwoody resident and Patsy Ramsey's
sister. ``It must be a full investigative process, inclusive of
family, the immediate circle of family and friends, the extended
community, known criminals and business associates.''
</P>
<P>
   But after three years of intense scrutiny, what more could be
found? Pizzi, who also is a former federal prosecutor, is
skeptical. ``I don't think it's solvable,'' he said. ``They've been
over and over and over the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if the crime is solved, it does not necessarily mean a
conviction. ``Time is always a defense ally,'' said Suzy
Ockleberry, a former Fulton County prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ramsey case, police officers' handling of the crime scene
would provide a good defense attorney the opportunity to serve
jurors ``reasonable doubt on a silver platter,'' Ockleberry said.
</P>
<P>
   Those doubts could also taint any newly discovered evidence,
said Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental problems was the inexperience of the officers
leading to the contamination of the scene, and that's why I exclude
technological breakthroughs,'' Porter said. ``The scene is so
screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, police and prosecutors were often at
odds, and investigators came and went. ``All of that might have
killed the case,'' Porter said. ``But murder cases are never
closed. You just keep poking away at them and poking away at
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gwinnett district attorney recalled a 1983 slaying that
produced no leads until almost a year later, when an accomplice
blurted the truth to his girlfriend. That led to the conviction and
life sentence of Hazel Short for the killing of Catherine Tucker
Whitehead, her ex-husband's fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on the Ramseys as potential suspects recalls another
slaying, unsolved for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 24, 1990, Monica DaSilva's mother, Julie DaSilva Crain,
and stepfather, Michael Crain, called Reno, Nev., police and told
them their daughter was missing. Police found scuff marks outside
the 7-year-old's bedroom window. The window screen had been pried
open.
</P>
<P>
   Monica's body was found a month later in the desert outside
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Monica's parents spoke with police at length, hoping to clear
themselves so the investigation could focus elsewhere. But the
focus never changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't ever be cleared unless someone comes forward and
confesses,'' said Julie DaSilva Crain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever did that to JonBenet is going to get away with it,
too,'' she said. ``Whoever killed her is still out there.''

But prayer is often the message and a lawsuit claims that the

NEW YORK CLUB WANTS THE CUP, NOT THE MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The small alcove known as Palm Court at the New York
Yacht Club's headquarters on West 44th Street may be the loneliest
space in Manhattan. For decades it was graced by the America's Cup,
yachting's grandest prize. But for most of the last 16 years, the
tiny room has harbored only memories.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in the waters outside the cup's present residence in
Auckland, New Zealand, sailors for the New York-backed Young
America syndicate will begin their quest to return the trophy to
its longtime lair. Before they get a chance to race for the cup,
they must first dispatch 10 other challengers in the Louis Vuitton
Cup series. The winner will earn a crack at the Kiwis in February.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1983, in the 132 years of New York stewardship, the cup
was an enduring West Side fixture. But that year, a renegade
Australian crew stormed the figurative gates and swooshed the cup
down under. In 1987 _ Dennis Conner's comeback year _ a deeply
flawed New York campaign bent on retribution received a resounding
defeat. On 44th Street, thoughts of the vanished silverware were
best left unspoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were upset and going after each other,'' Vice Commodore
Charlie Dana said last week. ``It wasn't the greatest time around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   All that has changed. After spending eight years in San Diego,
in 1995 the cup was again liberated from its U.S. defenders, this
time by Team New Zealand. With the chance to bring the cup home if
the American team could mount a winning effort, the New York club's
interest in pursuing another challenge was sufficiently piqued.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was apparent that they were going to win, the Kiwis
asked us to be the challenger of record for the next event,'' said
David Elwell, a New York Yacht Club member who is the chairman of
the America's Cup Challengers Association, via phone from Auckland.
``There was a lengthy discussion about whether to do it, because
losing it had brought a lot of energy to other on-the-water
activities. But the consensus, which was pretty strong, was that we
should. And I think we've got as good a chance as anybody to get it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's hopes are firmly hitched to a wagon pulled by the
president of the Young America syndicate, John Marshall. A primary
architect of Conner's 1987 victory, Marshall is now ensconced in
his ninth cup campaign. Marshall sought the club's support soon
after the conclusion of the '95 regatta, which he had contested
unsuccessfully in Young America's inaugural effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``An America's Cup campaign is a lot like a high-tech start-up
where you spend three or four years doing R&AMP;D before you have a
product you can take to market,'' Marshall said in a recent
interview, ``which in our case is a race boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``So our first challenge was securing a team of backers with a
long-term point of view,'' he said. ``I thought we'd find that kind
of mission-oriented attitude at the NYYC, so we sought an alliance
with them. If possible, we wanted to be their challenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's wish was granted, and Young America set forth on a
vast, full-scale technology program under the guidance of the
project manager Duncan MacLane and the designer Bruce Farr. They
examined hundreds of computer models, created and tank-tested
dozens of small-scale hull models, and ultimately produced two
impeccable carbon-fiber yachts from the Rhode Island builder Eric
Goetz.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a costly venture and Marshall admits that _ as is the
case with most syndicates on the eve of racing _ Young America's
projected $40 million budget has not yet been raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the possible exception of Prada and Team New Zealand,
anyone who says they're fully funded is stretching things a bit,''
he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Approximately three-quarters of the funding to date has come
from the syndicate's 2,500 private donors, most of whom are NYYC
members. Young America is also receiving support from six ``partner
yacht clubs.'' But corporate backing has been scarcer than
expected. Marshall did manage to secure a reported $2.5 million
deal with Fox Sports, but he was forced to renege after ESPN, the
cup broadcaster, balked at the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   In Auckland, where Young America's skipper, Ed Baird, is
commanding a sailing and support group of about 65 people,
financial matters are taking a back seat to the business finally at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a tremendous number of talented people here that are
trying to beat us,'' Baird said via telephone. ``That's all we're
thinking about. It's time to go racing.''
</P>
<P>
   If Baird and his crew do win the cup, there is a quiet spot
waiting for it in the heart of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is we wouldn't nail it down there in quite the
same way,'' said Dana. ``I assume it would travel to the partner
yacht clubs. It would be more mobile. But I've got to tell you, it
looked pretty good there.''

WITH DISAPPOINTMENT ON THE WANE, SPREWELL IS FINALLY SET TO MOVE
ON
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Finally the inexhaustible Latrell Sprewell came
to a stop, as abruptly as a windup toy. On a night in late June, as
the San Antonio Spurs spilled onto the court around him, Sprewell
could only stare at the pinwheel ceiling of Madison Square Garden
in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   It was really over.
</P>
<P>
   The season in which he transformed himself from league menace to
marketing dream, the season in which he became known as a leader of
a playoff team instead of a star for a losing franchise, was sealed
after his electric 35-point effort in Game 5 of the National
Basketball Association finals. Even so, he was a crestfallen sight
when his 27th shot attempt that night fell short at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had it in my head that we were going to go on,'' Sprewell
said Saturday. ``That was my mind-set. You couldn't have told me at
that point that we were going to lose. I guess that finally set in,
that I was wrong and that it was all over. There was just a lot of
disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sprewell started Saturday night's exhibition game against
Cleveland at the Carrier Dome, that was the last image anyone had
of the Knicks' frenetic star in competition. As he looked back on
it Saturday, he wondered what would have happened if the Knicks'
last play of the game _ a pass to Sprewell under the basket, where
he was pinned by two Spurs and forced into an errant shot at the
buzzer _ had been run for Allan Houston instead.
</P>
<P>
   During the fourth quarter, Sprewell had taken almost every shot
for the Knicks, while Houston, the Knick most likely to come
through at the buzzer, had put up just one attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should have run the play for Allan, to throw them
off,'' Sprewell said. ``I think they were expecting me to get the
ball. If we'd run the play for Allan, and had me coming up, then
they would have been focusing on me more as opposed to Allan, and
we probably could have gotten that shot off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think San Antonio's focus, looking back at it, would have
been on me. I was having such a good game, and they were expecting
me to get the ball. I've got to think they would have been
concentrating on me more.''
</P>
<P>
   The play is not burned on his memory. Not once during the
summer, he said, did he look back on a game that left everyone else
with one final glowing impression of the guard who arrived in New
York under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get into myself that much,'' Sprewell said.
``Obviously, I had people telling me that I did a great job and
that type of thing. I don't like looking at it or remembering it
personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I do know that it's something I could be proud of,
that I did get to the finals and did some good things. But we
didn't finish it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Just to get there seemed miraculous, especially for Sprewell,
the unlikely fit in the Knicks' improbable playoff run. At first,
he was the malcontent, the grumbler in the locker room unhappy with
his unglamorous bench role. Then, with the playoffs, everything
changed for a team and a player who had both come full circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy, either,'' said Sprewell, who formed a quick
bond with the New York fans despite a history that included the day
he choked his former coach with Golden State, P.J. Carlesimo. ``I
look at all the difficult times we had last year, like when we were
.500 and everyone's talking about we're done. There was a question
as to whether we were going to make it to the playoffs. We fought
through adversity as a team. And me, individually, it took me
awhile to come around as a player. It just didn't happen
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Sprewell would try to pick up where he left off.
In a return to the lineup that was delayed by his cross-country
road trip _ which caused him to miss training camp, and to be
suspended for the Knicks' first preseason game last Tuesday _
Sprewell was eager to see just where his game was at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to get back in, and get back on pace again and just see
how I feel out there,'' Sprewell said. ``I'm anxious to do that. I
think everything else will come with time, touch and everything.''

ORIOLES DENIED PERMISSION TO TALK TO YANKS' EXECUTIVE  
 WELLS INVITED 
TORRE ON HARGROVE 
THE NOMAR AND DEREK SHOW
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In their search for a general manager, the Baltimore
Orioles asked for permission in the last few days to interview
Gordon Blakeley, the Yankees' director of international and
professional scouting. But George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner,
rejected the request, according to a high-ranking baseball
official.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeley has been integral in the Yankees' efforts to add
players like Orlando Hernandez, Hideki Irabu and others, and with
the Yankees' farm system generally being considered one of the
best, Blakeley and other club officials have drawn interest from
other teams. The Colorado Rockies and Milwaukee Brewers asked for
permission to interview Mark Newman, who had been the Yankees' vice
president for player development and scouting, for general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner would not allow the Rockies and Brewers to speak
with Newman, and then Steinbrenner promoted Newman to be his
president of baseball operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles are seeking a general manager to replace Frank Wren,
who was fired last week.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Invited
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox invited former Yankees pitcher David Wells to be
their guest for Saturday's Game 3, according to a report published
here. The reasoning, a team spokesman said, was that the Red Sox
wanted to honor Wells for his perfect game last season. It is
specious timing, at best: Wells, of course, was traded for Roger
Clemens this past spring, and it would easy to perceive the Red Sox
were somehow trying to tweak the Yankees by inviting Wells, some 17
months after his perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, shrugged his shoulders at the
Red Sox invitation. ``I would imagine that Homer Bush and Graeme
Lloyd would be offended,'' he said dryly, mentioning the two other
players who went from the Yankees to Toronto in the Clemens trade.
</P>
<P>
   Bucky Dent, who hit the three-run homer in the 1978 one-game
playoff against the Red Sox, initially was on a list as a possible
player to throw out a first ball during the Boston series. But
Yankees officials deemed it would be in poor taste to use Dent in
this way.
</P>
<P>
   Torre on Hargrove
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, was displeased with the manner
in which Cleveland dismissed its manager, Mike Hargrove. John Hart,
the Indians' general manager, said that he was hoping to hire a
manager who would take the team to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothered me,'' said Torre, ``and I am speaking
from experience, I wish people would say, `We are going to make a
change, we are going to try something different.' Don't say that
`we are trying to get to the next level,' or `we want to get these
players to play harder,' or whatever it may be. Just make a change
and I think the managers understand that. It is just a little
insulting when some of the reasoning comes out that `we are going
to the next level.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Nomar and Derek Show
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra was jogging past third base and Derek Jeter
was tossing a baseball in foul territory during batting practice
Saturday. Garciaparra jokingly asked Jeter if he was going to
imitate Garciaparra's stance during the game, which is what Jeter
did during the All-Star Game at Fenway Park in July.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter smiled at the question and immediately widened his legs
and began to tap his left and right feet, just like the fidgety
Garciaparra, who loved the impromptu show. But earlier last week,
Jeter said that Garciaparra told him his imitation during the
All-Star Game had been faulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said I did it wrong,'' Jeter said. ``I struck out.''
</P>
<P>
   When Garciaparra was asked about Jeter's imitation at the
All-Star Game, he said, ``It's all about having fun and we had
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter had some more fun before Saturday's game when a girl
leaned over the railing behind third base and asked Jeter to marry
her. She had ``Jeter'' printed across her forehead, dyed blue hair
and blue and white hearts painted on her cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``How old are you?'' Jeter asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 14,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter replied, ``I'm too old for you.'' Jeter did agree to sign
a large picture of himself for the teen-ager. Her proposal
rebuffed, the girl said, ``Can you put `Love, Derek' on it?''

ARTAX RACES HIS WAY INTO BREEDERS' CUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Artax raced to a stunning victory in the Forest
Hills Handicap at Belmont Park Saturday, broke the track record for
six furlongs and earned a trip to the Breeders' Cup against the
world's best sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old son of Marquetry had never won a race at six
furlongs, mainly because he has been a notoriously bad gate horse
who customarily lost ground at the start, and his weakness was
heightened when he drew the inside post position on the rail. But
under Jorge Chavez, the colt broke sharply into the lead and held
it, kicking into a second gear when threatened in the homestretch
and flew home 6 1-2 lengths in front of Good and Tough.
</P>
<P>
   His winning time of 1:07 3/5 was one-fifth of a second better
than the Belmont Park record for 3/4 miles, set by Groovy in 1987.
And his performance won him a trip to the Breeders' Cup
championships at Gulfstream Park in Florida on Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a good horse to beat him'' said Louis
Albertrani, who trains Artax for Ernie Paragallo's Paraneck Stable.
``He's an amazing animal. He loves what he does.''
</P>
<P>
   And Frank Alexander, the trainer of Good and Tough, said the two
colts would meet again in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, and added: ``As
for Artax, he's just a bottomless pit. He just keeps running.''
</P>
<P>
   Artax, who had won only twice this year, both times at seven
furlongs, broke alertly this time and just kept running. He was
chased by Bet Me Best under Jerry Bailey, but in the homestretch it
was Artax opening his lead to four lengths as Bet Me Best faded to
sixth place. At the wire, Good and Tough had 1 1-2 lengths on
Intidab, who finished third.
</P>
<P>
   In the second of four stakes, the Kelso Handicap, another trip
to the Breeders' Cup was won by Middlesex Drive when he led almost
all the way and scored by a 1 1-2 lengths over Divide and Conquer.
The favorite, Vergennes, ran fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex Drive, a 4-year-old son of Pine Bluff, won for the
third time in seven starts this year. He ran the mile in 1:35 2/5
on the turf under Shane Sellers, and returned $8.80 for a $2 bet to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's proven he can handle soft turf,'' said Phil Hauswald, who
trains Middlesex Drive for C. Steven Duncker, ``And nobody really
challenged him today. Hopefully, he'll go next in the Breeders' Cup
Mile.''
</P>
<P>
   No Breeders' Cup implications were involved in the day's two
other stakes, the Cowdin and the Astarita for 2-year-old horses.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cowdin, a driving stretch run gave Twilight Time a
two-length victory over Sky Dweller. And in the Astarita, after an
awkward start and some bumping, Silentlea rallied in the final
furlongs and won by a neck over Valerie's Dream.

TEXAS A&AMP;M ROUGHS IT IN THUMPING KANSAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M doubled the score and the
total offense statistics yesterday on Kansas, but the 13th-ranked
Aggies walked away from a 34-17 triumph feeling unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely need to pick up our level of play,'' said punter
Shane Lechler, who figured prominently in a game-turning,
two-minute stretch that saw the Aggies strike for three touchdowns
to erase a 10-3 deficit and quiet the nervous chatter of 70,232
fans at Kyle Field. ``If we don't, we don't deserve to play for the
South Division championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies (5-1, 2-1) moved into a tie for first place in the
Big 12 South by handing the Jayhawks (2-5, 0-3) their fifth
consecutive loss in conference play. A&AMP;M rolled for 522 yards,
including a career-high 362 passing yards from quarterback Randy
McCown. The defense, after allowing 155 yards on Kansas' first
three drives, allowed just 91 yards on 39 snaps (2.3 per play) on
the Jayhawks' final 11 possessions.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aggies frustrated themselves by losing the turnover
battle, 3-1, and failing to stop the Kansas offense until they
faced a 10-0 deficit that could have been larger if not for a
missed 27-yard field goal by Jayhawks kicker Joe Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can dissect it any way you want. And there are a number of
things I wish we'd have done better, on offense and defense,'' A&AMP;M
coach R.C. Slocum said. ``The most important thing is we did win.
But we'll have to play a lot better than this to have a chance to
win next week \Rat Oklahoma\S.''
</P>
<P>
   The play that jump-started A&AMP;M's game-turning scoring spree was
an attempted punt.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies trailed, 10-3, when officials flagged Kansas' Matt
Jordan for roughing the punter, negating a short kick by Lechler.
Kansas coaches argued that no penalty should have been called
because Jordan was blocked into Lechler by A&AMP;M's Amon Simon.
Lechler said he felt contact from both players and ``would expect
to get that call every Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the 15-yard penalty allowed A&AMP;M to retain possession
with 1:30 remaining in the first half rather than giving Kansas the
ball at the Aggies' 34-yard line. The Aggies took advantage,
covering 68 yards in three plays to tie the game. McCown found
Chris Taylor for 41 yards on the first play, then hit Leroy Hodge
for a 15-yard touchdown strike with 52 seconds remaining in the
half, igniting a stretch when A&AMP;M scored 21 points in 1:50.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies took their first lead after recovering a fumble on
the ensuing kickoff by Kansas' Mitch Bowles. Three plays later,
McCown completed a 37-yard march with a 15-yard touchdown scramble.
It marked the Aggies' second touchdown in 29 seconds and provided a
17-10 halftime cushion.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M stretched the lead on the second play of the second half,
with McCown hitting Taylor (4 catches, 143 yards) for a 78-yard
touchdown strike to conclude the Aggies' 10.5 points-per-minute
outburst.
</P>
<P>
   Players from both sides pointed to the roughing call as pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A penalty like that can make or break a team. They had the
momentum going and that pretty much killed them,'' Lechler said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks took advantage of blown coverage by A&AMP;M linebacker
Cornelius Anthony to post a 26-yard touchdown pass from Dylen Smith
to Sean McDermott, cutting A&AMP;M's lead to 24-17. But the Jayhawks
managed just 37 yards on their final 29 plays against the A&AMP;M
defense.
</P>
<P>
   McCown, meanwhile, continued throwing strikes. He completed 21
of 30 passes and, aided by a fourth-quarter touchdown jaunt from
fullback Ja'Mar Toombs (10 carries, 52 yards), helped the Aggies
clinch the contest with two late scoring drives.
</P>
<P>
   McCown said he threw ``as well as I have all year,'' but
chastised himself for a fourth-quarter interception. It matched on
ongoing theme for A&AMP;M players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a comfortable win,'' offensive guard Chris Valletta said.
``But we're not satisfied.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Where is Roger? the Fenway Park patrons began asking
collectively in the seventh inning, with full-throated irony. They
knew Clemens was somewhere in the Yankees' clubhouse, having failed
miserably, a manner for which only the most vicious Red Sox fan
would have prayed.
</P>
<P>
   Boston battered Clemens, who lasted only one batter into the
third inning, and went on to destroy the Yankees, 13-1, to win Game
3 of the American League Championship Series, while Boston's Pedro
Martinez allowed two hits and struck out 12 in seven innings. Nomar
Garciaparra of the Red Sox had four of Boston's 21 hits, an ALCS
record.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees lead the four-of-seven-game series by two games to
one. A loss would have all but finished the Red Sox; the Yankees
would have led by three games to none and no team has ever come
back from that kind of deficit to win in baseball's post-season.
But the Red Sox are right back into the thick of the matter now,
with the veteran Bret Saberhagen pitching for Boston in Game 4
against Andy Pettitte. And the Red Sox will play with the knowledge
that if this series goes to a seventh game, Martinez will pitch
against Clemens again.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, watched the
demolition stoically from a private box behind home plate, shaking
his head slightly a couple of times. But after the Yankees were
retired in the fourth, Steinbrenner got up and went out of sight,
and didn't return to his seat until the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, players from both teams were introduced, the
national anthem was played by the Boston Symphony Orchestra and
then the position players from the Yankees and Red Sox began their
final pregame stretching. The scheduled starting time was only 10
minutes away, and Clemens had still not appeared on the field for
his pregame warm-up, for his first contemptuous greeting from the
Boston fans.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged from the Yankees' dugout at 4:05, his hair freshly
shorn to a length that would have satisfied a Marine drill
sergeant. The men, women and children who once regarded him the way
New York regarded Gehrig and DiMaggio and Mantle began to boo as
soon as they noticed Clemens. Eventually, their derision was
combined into the corrosive chorus of ``Roger, Roger.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens tapped Joe Girardi on the top of his head as he
completed his warm-ups and strolled from the Yankees' bullpen in
right-center field, all the way across the field to the visitors'
dugout along the third base line, the boos and the chorus following
him. Martinez retired the Yankees in the first inning, and when
Clemens headed toward the mound for the bottom of the first, he
walked into a wall of vocal ire again.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' first pitch was a fastball high and outside _ a
telltale sign when Clemens is anxious. On Friday, Martinez had said
of Clemens, ``I hope he puts a lot of pressure on himself and I
hope he gives it up soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman, the Boston lead-off batter, turned on Clemens'
second pitch and drove it deep to right field. Paul O'Neill,
manning that position for the Yankees, stared into the same
late-afternoon sun that Lou Piniella had in the ninth inning of the
one-game playoff in 1978, but unlike Piniella, O'Neill was unable
to find the ball. By the time he realized it was over his head and
skipping off the low wall behind him, Offerman was well on his way
to third for a lead-off triple.
</P>
<P>
   It would get much, much worse for Clemens, who was struggling to
command his split-fingered fastball. He tried zipping a fastball
past John Valentin, belly-button high, inside half of the plate,
and Valentin lifted a deep fly into the wind that was blowing hard
over the left-field fence; the ball dropped halfway up the screen
that stands above the 27-foot-high wall in left field. Two batters,
two runs. No one would know for sure, but the game was effectively
over, save for what remained of Clemens' humiliating afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   An error and a walk prolonged the first inning, in which Clemens
would be forced to throw 26 pitches. One out into the second, Trot
Nixon laced a split-fingered fastball into the left field corner
for a double, and Offerman, too, lined a single, Nixon stopping at
third.  &UR; Roger, Roger &LR; , they cried.
</P>
<P>
   A groundout scored a run, and Clemens threw nine pitches to
Jason Varitek before walking him. As Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees'
pitching coach, went to the mound _ probably to give Clemens a
rest, more than anything _ Clemens squatted behind the mound,
staring at the ground. Pitcher and coach spoke for about 30
seconds, and when Stottlemyre went back to the dugout to report to
Manager Joe Torre, the manager grimaced at what Stottlemyre told
him, and within seconds Hideki Irabu was warming up in the Yankees'
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra singled home another run, another ball hit hard; the
Red Sox led by 4-0 after two innings, and Clemens had thrown 58
pitches. Irabu kept throwing between innings and it appeared he
would begin the next inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens took the mound for the third, allowing a lead-off
single. After Brian Daubach fouled sharply, Torre went to relieve
Clemens. Before he asked for the ball, however, Torre reached both
hands and placed them at Clemens' side and spoke directly to
Clemens, as if to explain his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens then handed the ball to Torre, stepped off the mound,
and the fans who tormented him stood and roared: a conquering. All
that was needed was for Martinez to plant the final flag for Red
Sox fans on a glorious Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had an exceptional change-up, breaking late on its
journey homeward and breaking low; it so happened that the
change-up may have been the best possible pitch, given the
conditions. The sun, setting below the stands behind home plate,
cast shadows that covered the infield and reached halfway across
the outfield when the game began.
</P>
<P>
   As Torre explained before the game, the difficulty of hitting in
shadows isn't necessarily because the ball is obscured; it's just
that the stands in center field, covered in sunshine until dusk,
reflect a glare at the hitters, so that the face of the ball they
see is only a dark spot. Imagine trying to hit while staring into a
lunar eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez wasn't throwing nearly as hard as he usually does, 88
to 91 miles an hour, instead of the 94 to 97 mph he buried the
Yankees with last month. But the mere threat of his fastball,
complicated by the shadows, forced the Yankees to anticipate
fastballs, and Martinez kept flopping change-ups that were about 10
mph slower than his fastball. Tino Martinez swung and missed at a
change-up to strike out leading off the second, and so did Ricky
Ledee, to end the same inning.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out two more in the third, two more in the
fourth, the rout was on, and the Fenway chorus had time to clear
their minds of all the contempt they have for Clemens, and inquire
of his whereabouts.

WHAT WOES? RED SOX SET ALCS HIT MARK  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the midafternoon sunshine, amid the festive fans
outside Fenway Park, a tall man wearing a red, white and blue Uncle
Sam costume carried a sign that said ``This Yankee Loves the Red
Sox.'' A younger man in a gray Boston jersey walked up to him and
hugged him and said, ``It's a good day to be an American _ and a
Dominican.''
</P>
<P>
   The second reference applied to Pedro Martinez, Boston's
starting pitcher from the Dominican Republic. Martinez pitched
brilliantly in a 13-1 victory over the Yankees to cut the Yankees
lead to 2 games to 1 in the four-of-seven-game American League
Championship Series. Games 4 and 5 will be played here on Sunday
and Monday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the pitching of Martinez, it was a good day to be a
Boston Red Sox batter _ from New Jersey, like John Valentin; or
from Illinois, like Brian Daubach; or from the Dominican Republic,
like Jose Offerman; or from North Carolina, like Trot Nixon; or
from California, like Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's hit total, 21, set a record for the ALCS The previous
record was 19, by the Yankees, in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   They started hitting early against Yankees starter Roger
Clemens, who fell behind by 2-0 in a New York minute after a triple
by Offerman and a home run by Valentin, the first two batters he
faced. The Sox ended up with 21 hits off four Yankee pitchers.
Three hits were home runs, one was a triple, six were doubles and
11 were singles.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games at Yankee Stadium, the Red Sox had scored
a total of five runs; they exceeded that total before the end of
the third inning on Saturday. The scenario was strikingly similar
to that of the previous round. After losing the first two games to
the Indians at Jacobs Field, they returned to Fenway to score 32
runs in two games beneath the shadow of the Green Monster, the big
wall that dominates left field. They went on to clinch that series
in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's barrage was led by Valentin, who had a home run in
his first trip to the plate and ended up with three hits and five
runs batted in. He had a similar performance in Game 4 last Sunday
against Cleveland, with two home runs and seven r.b.i. Coming into
Saturday's game, Valentin led his team in post-season production
with 12 r.b.i. He is tied with Garciaparra for the home run lead
with four.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra had four hits and drove in three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Mineola, N.Y., Valentin is a graduate of St. Anthony's
high school in Jersey City, N.J. He attended Seton Hall University.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Boston Manager Jimy Williams was asked about
the concept of home-field advantage, particularly for his team.
Though every ball park is different, no park is more different than
this quirky fun house in Kenmore Square. It sometimes intimidates
pitchers, and scores in double figures are not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in baseball there is less of a home-field advantage
over all than other sports,'' Williams said. ``I don't know if
there is a home-field advantage stronger here than anywhere else I
have been. If the fans feel it creates enthusiasm and electricity
and they really get involved, then maybe it can, maybe it does.''

 &HT;    Yankees strong on Pettitte
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Andy Pettitte pitches New York's next most important
game tonight, which in itself represents something of an upset. It
seems to him once July comes around, the Yankees have tried to dump
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last couple of years, I have kind of been in that
same situation, where they seemed to talk about trading me every
year,'' said Pettitte (14-11), who faces Boston's Bret Saberhagen
(10-6). ``The only thing was, this year, it was intensified a
little bit more. I really did feel like I might be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' complaint about Pettitte through the years has not
changed: too inconsistent, too soft, too heavy-maintenance. Since a
sensational 21-8 season in 1996 in his first full season, Pettitte
since 1998 into the last All-Star break was 21-18 and while his
place in the rotation grew more significant _ the only left-hander
after the departure of David Wells _ so too grew New York's
concerns that he was dragging the staff down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I was asked for my opinion, we were strong in favor
of keeping Andy,'' said manager Joe Torre. ``That didn't mean we
were going to keep him, but it got to the point where (owner)
George Steinbrenner said, `Well, it's going to be your decision.'
We made it and we're glad we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the All-Star break, Pettitte was 9-4 with a 3.84 ERA,
lowest among the rotation. While he hardly has an overpowering
fastball, he has the ability to change speeds and hit his spots to
be effective. What he had lost was his aggressiveness, which
pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre began reconstructing after a
disastrous 11-3 loss at Chicago on July 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tough but I felt I was able to block that out and
continue to work on my pitching, try to figure out what I was doing
wrong,'' Pettitte said. ``And me and Mel continued to work hard. It
was very, very gratifying to turn the year around.''
</P>
<P>
   RE-ORDERING
</P>
<P>
   The Boston lineup reflected a considerable change. Brian
Daubach, who made 82 of his 95 starts this season batting third,
was dropped to seven in the order after hitting just .192 in six
playoff games. Catcher Jason Varitek, who hit in the seven and
eighth slots in 102 games, was moved up to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he hasn't been there,'' said manager Jimy
Williams, who used Varitek third in the Cleveland series.
</P>
<P>
   HARGROVE FALLOUT
</P>
<P>
   The fraternity of managers is stronger than most realize. Though
Torre helped contribute to the firing of Cleveland's Mike Hargrove
_ the Yankees ousted Cleveland from the 1998 ALCS _ Torre took
exception to how Hargrove was dismissed by general manager John
Hart on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish people would say, `We are going to make a change, we
are going to try something different, blah, blah, blah,' '' said
Torre, who has been fired in Atlanta and New York (Mets). ``Don't
say, `We are trying to get the next level, or we want these players
to play harder.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Because then you are telling me that somebody getting a base
hit with the bases loaded or getting a hitter to strike out would
have been enough to get him to the next level, that would have been
enough. Just make a change and I think the manager understands
that. It is just a little insulting when some of the reasoning
comes out, that we are going to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Martinez brothers, Pedro and Ramon, are the first
pair of brothers to appear in an LCS since Andy and Alan Benes both
appeared in the 1996 NLCS for St. Louis.

AS COMPETITION HEATS UP, BRADLEY STICKS TO RELAXED STYLE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ At a wind-whipped ceremony Saturday following a
race to benefit breast cancer research, Ernestine Bradley, the wife
of former Sen. Bill Bradley and a breast cancer survivor herself,
had just finished addressing a crowd of runners when the master of
ceremonies offered the microphone to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, who stood shivering in his pink ``Race for the
Cure'' T-shirt near the back of the stage, shook his head no.
``He's here for the cause, not to politic,'' the host, Jeanette
Trompeter, a local television anchorwoman, told the crowd of
several hundred runners, most of them women. ``We love that.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, a Democratic candidate for president, it was the
perfect campaign moment. Without looking like a stage-hogging
politician, he had managed to get a plug for his insurgent
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the moment underscored another aspect of Bradley's campaign
as well. At the end of a potentially discouraging week in which he
lost the endorsement of the powerful AFL-CIO to Vice President Al
Gore, his sole Democratic rival, Bradley is stubbornly trying to
demonstrate that he has not been knocked off his casual, almost
laid-back style of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   As he has throughout the campaign, Bradley met with small groups
of supporters and undecided Democrats in living rooms, in a
restaurant and a union hall. As usual, he was spare on policy
details and stuck closely to his standard stump speech, which
focuses on his Midwestern roots and his resume _ Rhodes scholar,
professional basketball player, three-term senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   And though Gore has been questioning Bradley's loyalty to the
Democratic Party in recent days, Bradley refused, again as usual,
to respond in kind to the vice president's attacks. ``I think the
American people are tired of negative politics,'' was his response
to reporters' questions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides also said they had no intention of speeding up
their schedule for running television commercials just because the
vice president began broadcasting his first spots this past week.
The aides said Bradley would probably not start running television
advertisements in Iowa, which kicks off the primary season on Jan.
24, until around Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Iowans who came to hear Bradley said they were not
surprised that he was hewing to his unhurried pace, since it seemed
to play well here. ``That's the Bradley lifestyle,'' said Harold
Wells, a Democrat in Des Moines who remains undecided. ``He seems
not to be affected by political strategies. I'm sure he is. But
that's what endears him to people.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is always a risk when a candidate fails to grab the
microphone to defend or promote himself at every opportunity. And
so a few Iowa Democrats said they were puzzled that the former
senator would continue with a low-keyed approach, saying they
wondered whether it would work well with large audiences, or help
him stave off aggressive attacks in the heat of a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm supporting him but I don't know how well he'll sell out
there,'' said Brent Rosenberg, 49, a Des Moines lawyer. ``I didn't
hear a single sound bite. That's fine, but he'll have to find a way
to sell himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's events here were clearly targeted to specific
Democratic constituent groups that his campaign considers vital to
winning the Iowa caucuses: women, gays and lesbians, and union
workers.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of about 30 homosexual Democrats in Des Moines,
Bradley said he would expand the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to cover
homosexuals, and supported allowing homosexuals to serve openly in
the military. He also said that if he faced Gov. George W. Bush, a
Republican, in the general election, he would make a campaign issue
of Bush's opposition to hate-crime legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply cannot have gays be treated as a different category
of person when it comes to violence,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bradley did not once mention Gore by name, he frequently
pointed out differences in their styles and background, calling the
vice president the candidate of ``entrenched power.''
</P>
<P>
   And in what seemed a response to Gore's first campaign
commercial _ which features the vice president speaking forcefully
about the need for a nuclear test ban treaty _ Bradley said his
18-year Senate career was good preparation for being president
because it had taught him about foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley concluded his day at a Democratic dinner held in a
United Auto Workers union hall in Newton, where he told the crowd
that he would support measures to make it easier for workers to
form unions. Though the UAW in Iowa endorsed Gore, Bradley's aides
said he is convinced he can still win over many union workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite what the union leadership has done, he's going to keep
talking to the rank and file,'' said Dan Lucas, Bradley's campaign
manager in Iowa. ``He's showing that he won't be intimidated about
going before groups that might not seem to be in his corner.''

 &HT;    Rams' upstart season has familiar ring to Falcons
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons' defense hasn't been this riled up all
season, several of the offensive players say.
</P>
<P>
   They probably need to be. Today, they play the equivalent of the
'98 Falcons _ but wearing the uniforms of the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between the 4-0 Rams and last year's NFC champion
Falcons are hard to miss.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, a long-downtrodden team was much better than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference is the Falcons did not have a quarterback
come completely out of nowhere, as Rams quarterback Kurt Warner
has.
</P>
<P>
   Warner has thrown 14 touchdown passes. Against Atlanta on Sept.
26 in St. Louis, he threw for three and ran for another as the Rams
beat the Falcons 35-7.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's very healthy confidence leads a team that began the
season battling the Bengals for most losses of the decade. The Rams
haven't had a winning season in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are acting like world-beaters. That and a generally
clean bill of health were perhaps the two most important keys to
success for the Falcons last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have got a lot of confidence,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves
said. ``They had a schedule that certainly has been favorable, but
they also took advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The game in Atlanta will be the second on the road for the Rams,
who won 38-10 at Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   But their confidence could be growing too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were giddy after last Sunday's 42-20 thrashing of the
49ers, who had beaten them 17 times in a row.
</P>
<P>
   After some of them commented after the game that they had just
beaten the team that was best in their division a year earlier, a
few Falcons did not take it too well.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta won the NFC West last year, beating the 49ers two of
three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to remember we were 14-2 last year,'' center Robbie
Tobeck said on his radio show on WGST.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons hold dear the memories of last year's Super Bowl
season, which might count for something today in a Georgia Dome
that will be about two-thirds full.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler is expected to start after missing
three of the last four games with a strained right hamstring. But
running back Jamal Anderson, weak-side linebacker Keith Brooking
and probably middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle are out with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating because we know we're a better football team
than the numbers show,'' Tobeck said. ``But that doesn't mean we
can't be a good football team.''

 &HT;    Pall over Isles deepens
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ There was a knock on the door and a
middle-aged woman carrying room service soon entered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look down,'' she said. ``What's wrong? You work for the
Islanders?''
</P>
<P>
   It is 1999. It's clear it's not 1980 or '81 or '82 or '83
because all of the banners at the Nassau Coliseum across the street
look old and tattered and the arena has all the warmth of a ghost
town like Tombstone, Ariz. Just as populated, too.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, the Thrashers played the New York Islanders.
The crowd was small, the kind players like to refer to as ``family
and friends night.'' The attendance was never announced. The
scoresheet later read: 5,219. The actual turnstile count, a club
official later confessed, probably was closer to 3,000. Connect the
dots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so sad,'' former Islanders Hall of Fame defenseman Denis
Potvin said by telephone from Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ``I watched the
game on television and the TV cameras were doing a good job trying
not to show the empty seats. I still go there sometimes and it's
not the same. The place is dingy. Sad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers won the game 2-0, their first victory in franchise
history. Potvin said, ``These current Islanders will do that.
They'll put you in the win column.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Simon sang, ``An island never cries.'' He never said
anything about rebelling. The team that became a model expansion
franchise, suffering pains while building through the draft, then
winning four consecutive Stanley Cups to start the 1980s, keeps
discovering new bottoms. There is some young talent on the roster,
but the team is not likely to amount to much for a variety reasons
_ most of them financial.
</P>
<P>
   Current ownership _ Howard and Ed Milstein and Steven Gluckstern
_ has so alienated fans that they won't show up. What used to be a
tough ticket to buy is now a tough one to sell. High-salaried
players have been shipped out. The top three point scorers from a
year ago are gone _ Ziggy Palffy (traded to Los Angeles), Trevor
Linden (traded to Montreal), Bryan Smolinski (also L.A.). The only
franchise with a lower payroll than New York ($17.734 million) is
first-year Atlanta ($17.057 million).
</P>
<P>
   Ownership further infuriated residents by moving the team out of
the Coliseum for roughly a week last year in the preseason,
claiming it was an unsafe venue, as if the scoreboard was going to
fall on Gino Odjick's head. The league, a lack of options and that
annoyance called a lease eventually forced the team back.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the midst of the Isles' 48-loss season (second only to
Tampa Bay), there was Ed Milstein's ill-fated pursuit of the
Washington Redskins. If only NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue
embraced Milstein as much as NHL commissioner Gary Bettman wanted
to get rid of him, Milstein might have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Milstein) went after the Redskins, the people kind of
felt like he was turning his back on the franchise,'' said
Thrashers defenseman David Harlock, who played with the Islanders
last season.
</P>
<P>
   It's a no-win situation for new coach Butch Goring, who
nonetheless has remained enthusiastic, and general manager Mike
Milbury, who actually has done a good job in adverse circumstances.
Milbury declined an interview request.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question the team needs a new building. But
politicians aren't going to push for a tax increase to fund an
arena if their constituents despise the owners. NHL officials
maintain three teams in the New York-New Jersey area also can
thrive but they are monitoring ownership's next move. The chances
of the franchise uprooting are slim, given the lease and the fact
the team has a lucrative $13 million TV deal with Cablevision.
</P>
<P>
   But that's about it for the positive financial report. There is
a certain symmetry to the fact one of the ads on the Coliseum
dasher boards is for ``Aeroflot,'' the financially strapped Russian
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is somebody like Ted Turner or (Washington owner)
Ted Leonsis,'' said Potvin, now a TV commentator for the Florida
Panthers. ``We need someone to say, `Yeah, hockey is a business,
but I want to take care of this team and make it better.' The
Islanders haven't had that.''

 &HT;    Still Phloundering in NHL Eastern Conference
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ed Snider never has been known as a patient man, and
the Philadelphia Flyers owner predictably didn't react well when
the Flyers had zero wins and nine goals through five games. The day
after a loss to Washington, Snider left his executive suite and
drove an hour to the team's practice facility to meet with maligned
general manager Bob Clarke. Snider chatted briefly with players and
coach Roger Neilson, but had a closed-door three-hour meeting with
Clarke, with Neilson not present. Clarke later gave his version of
a no comment, saying, ``We were just going over our scouting.''
Funny. Snider also divulged little, claiming, ``My coming over here
is not a major issue. I want everybody to know that I'm behind
them. When you lose a few games in the first week, are you going to
throw your arms up and say that everything you've worked at for
several years should suddenly go down the drain? No.'' Snider
referred questions about Neilson's status to Clarke, who, of
course, wasn't available. But this is an organization that fired
Wayne Cashman after a half-season after he led the Flyers to the
finals. If the losing continues with the league's second-highest
payroll, the silence won't last long.
</P>
<P>
   DOLLARS AND SENSE
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa owner Rod Bryden has reaffirmed his threats to sell
and/or move the team out of Canada if the government does not
create some tax breaks. Only this time, the threats are attached to
a date. He says he will put the team up for sale if progress is not
made by the league's Board of Governers meetings Dec. 7-8 in Boca
Raton, Fla. The government has rejected both a hockey lottery and a
break on a provincial amusement tax. ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's season-ticket base is up 1,000 to 9,300, not quite
the 12,000 new owner Mario Lemieux was looking for but not bad
considering the protracted off-season bankruptcy proceedings. Team
vice president Tom McMillan says a ``realistic goal'' for this year
is 10,000. ``We've come a long way, but we have a long way to
go.''... The NHL never questioned New Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur
about a slashing incident. But his 4-year-old son, Anthony, did.
``I was watching `NHL Tonight' to see if they were going to make a
big deal out of it. Anthony said, `Daddy, you got kicked out? Did
you slash somebody?' He asked me again at breakfast, so I said,
`They put me in timeout.'''... At least three teams appear to be
seriously considering signing Dmitri Khristich, who became a free
agent when Boston walked away from a $2.8 million arbitration
award. The most visible: Toronto, which has a good shot at the Cup
this season, and recently lost Mats Sundin for four to six weeks
because of a broken foot.

 &HT;    Faceoff with Kings' Robataille
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Update: Scored seven goals and three assists in Kings'
first five games, all on the road. His 524 assists rank fifth among
active NHLers and is tied with Brian Trottier for 21st on the
all-time list. Also 24 short 1,000 games played.
</P>
<P>
   _ On his career rejuvenation: ``When I came (back) to L.A., I
got on a new program, trying to get a lot stronger, and at the same
time gain some speed on my first three or four strides. I knew
everybody was a lot bigger, so I tried to gain weight also. It
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On the Kings' fast start: ``We have Ziggy (Palffy) and (Brian)
Smolinski (from the Islanders) on the other line, and it brings us
a lot more offense. We've got that much more talent up front when
we're on the power play. Our skill level is higher this year.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On the change from Larry Robinson to Andy Murray as coach:
``(GM) Dave Taylor met with a lot of veterans and asked every one
of us what we thought would help with the team. We all wanted the
same thing: more discipline, and just a little bit more drive on a
day-in and day-out basis. When Andy came here from the first day,
the get-go, that's what we had. We had a little bit more discipline
and more organization. We had a lot more communication, too. It's
been great so far.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On growing up in Montreal and being only 20 goals behind
Canadiens legend Maurice ``Rocket'' Richard: ``He was more than a
player to most of us back there. To be near him in any kind of
statistic is pretty special. If I would have told somebody that I
was going to be 20 goals from ``Rocket'' Richard, they would look
at me like, `Are you nuts?' That's how far it was from my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   GAINEY: DUMP FIGHTING
</P>
<P>
   Fighting penalties have been dropping in recent seasons, though
violent incidents like Mike Modano being run into the boards head
first appear on the rise. But Dallas GM Bob Gainey would like to
see the NHL eliminate fighting altogether: ``I don't know how you
can justify fighting. That's not to say fights won't happen, but we
seem to compete without them in the Olympics and in international
playoffs and in our own playoffs. What a circumstance like Modano's
does is bring me to the point where I say, `Why don't we find out?'
... We're predicting all these things would happen (if we took it
out) without really knowing. To say that we have to allow fighting
because there would be injustices, to me, is like saying the courts
didn't give someone a big enough fine so it's OK to go firebomb his
house.''

 &HT;    Shark bait in NHL Western Conference
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The San Jose Sharks might not hold off Dallas over 82
games for the Pacific Division title, but their fast start isn't a
fluke. Steve Shields developed as one of the league's top goalies
last season and would have been nabbed by the Thrashers had he been
made available in the expansion draft instead of high-salaried
veteran Mike Vernon (who has lost his starting job and was pulled
midway through a game the other night). The Sharks also have one of
the top forward lines around. Heading into Saturday's game at
Washington, Owen Nolan, Jeff Friesen and Vincent Damphousse
(re-signed after being acquired from Montreal late last season) had
combined for 13 goals and 17 assists for 30 points in seven games.
The Stars' found out about the Sharks' speed, losing to them at
home, 2-0. San Jose was slugging against Nashville, but Shields
made 51 saves en route to a 5-2 win. Good teams win on bad nights.
When Sharks coach Darryl Sutter was asked about Shields' dominance,
he invoked the name of Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez. ``Someone
asked me recently if Boston could beat Cleveland,'' Sutter said.
``I said, if they pitch Martinez every game, they can win. That's
how I am with Shields. I'm playing him every game because he's
red-hot.''
</P>
<P>
   NASTY INJURY Detroit forward Darren McCarty, who has had a
history of bizarre injuries, continued the trend when he lost a
chunk of forehead skin after being cut by the skate of teammate
Yuri Butsayev. The incident led to the Red Wings searching the ice
in St. Louis for the missing flap of skin. It was found, with a bit
of eyebrow attached.
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas forward Joe Nieuwendyk, who majored in business at
Cornell, acted as his own agent in negotiating a three-year, $15
million extension with the Stars. ``It wasn't that tough,'' he
said. ``I knew where I fit in the market place, I knew how many
years I wanted and where I fit into the team structure.''...
Detroit has made an offer of about $5 million annually to Brendan
Shanahan, who is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent
after the season.... Anaheim's Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya had 31
shots between them in the Mighty Ducks' first five games, but only
two goals.... Bill Guerin, Edmonton's unsigned restricted free
agent, has asked to be traded, not that it will do any good. He is
asking for $3 million a year, about $700,000 more than is being
offered. ``I don't get it,'' Oilers GM Glen Sather said,
``(Buffalo's Miroslav) Satan just signed a three-year contract for
$2 million, $2.25 million and $2.5 million and he got 40 goals last
year. Billy got 30. Is Billy better than Satan?''

 &HT;    Stewart bursts into NASCAR
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Joe Gibbs warned Tony Stewart to avoid doing anything
that would risk injury.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs, the race-team owner, doesn't want to take any chances
with the NASCAR driver who has the chance to be the most prolific
rookie in Winston Cup's modern era.
</P>
<P>
   But last month in Charlotte, N.C., the two were making an
appearance for the team's sponsor, Atlanta-based Home Depot, at a
Habitat for Humanity construction site.
</P>
<P>
   After Gibbs gave his warning and left, Stewart grinned and asked
a fellow volunteer to find him some work gloves and tools.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that was Stewart, the fastest-rising star in the sport,
climbing high atop a ladder to install siding. Yes, that was
Stewart, who already had pulled in a million dollars in earnings
just over halfway through his inaugural season, delicately framing
a window. And yes, that was Stewart, after four hours of intense
construction work, trading jokes and signing autographs for the
other volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was having fun,'' said Greg Zipadelli, Stewart's crew
chief. ``He has a great deal of pride in that project. He was
banging nails and everything. He spent a lot of time there, more
than he needed to. But that's Tony; he's very caring and easygoing
when you get him outside of racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty days later on Oct. 3, Stewart was in his racing gear and
in no mood to laugh or joke around. He had wrecked the No. 20
Pontiac after a steady exchange of bumps with longtime rival Kenny
Irwin during the NAPA AutoCare 500 in Martinsville, Va. Stewart
sent Irwin spinning on the first two taps between the two, and
Irwin retaliated on the third exchange by bumping Stewart into the
outside retainer wall.
</P>
<P>
   With a tow truck on the way to load the car, Stewart pounded the
steering wheel and climbed out. The angry rookie yanked the
heat-shield pads off his shoes and waited in the middle of the
track. When Irwin approached, Stewart clapped his hands in mock
applause and heaved the pads at the car's windshield. As Irwin
slowed, Stewart charged and threw a series of left-handed punches
toward the cockpit area, with the Martinsville crowd roaring in
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony can be like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,'' Zipadelli said.
``There are some big changes in him when he is at the track. He is
very focused, extremely dedicated and won't settle for second with
his performance or ours as a team. That is what has made him as
good as he is today.''
</P>
<P>
   SETTING ROOKIE STANDARD
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana native is not only good; by rookie standards, he's
great. By taking the checkered flag at Richmond, he became the
first rookie winner since Davey Allison in 1987. Stewart is fifth
in the Winston Cup point standings entering today's Winston 500 at
Talladega Superspeedway. It has been 33 years since a first-year
driver finished the season in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony has done an awesome job; just look at the results,'' Jeff
Gordon said. ``It's hard to consider him a rookie because he has
driven so many types of cars and won so many championships
(including the 1997 Indy Racing League). It's like a surprise, but
not really a surprise he has done so well this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart often has been compared to Gordon, especially in their
fast ascents in the sport. However, the pair of 28-year olds differ
in their approach to the public and media: Gordon always seems to
attempt to avoid controversy by saying all the right things, while
Stewart says exactly what is on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am what I am _ take me or leave,'' Stewart said at
Darlington. ``I always get in trouble when I lose, whether I blew
an engine, got crashed or whatever, and that is when I stick my
foot in my mouth. Then, everybody seems to be like a vulture flying
over my head.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I accepted losing, why would you want me to drive your race
car? There are times I get sick of being politically correct. I got
into Winston Cup because I wanted to be a race driver. If I wanted
to be a politician, I would be in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's straightforward style is refreshing, because many
drivers' every word seems to be influenced by public-relations
officials and assorted handlers. Stewart is adamant about
preserving his own identity, at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody expects us to smile all the time and be perfect
angels,'' he said. ``I'm not that way, and I don't plan on being
that way. I plan on being myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have a bad day, I show it. If I have a good day, I show
it. Like everybody else, I'm a human being, and along with that
comes emotion. But the nice thing is that you at least know what I
am thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   APOLOGIZING FOR MISTAKES
</P>
<P>
   As with any rookie, Stewart has made his share of rookie
mistakes. Most notable was the Martinsville incident, which drew a
$5,000 fine from NASCAR. Stewart accepted the penalty and
apologized to Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to do the right things,'' Stewart said. ``I don't know
anybody in there that has done the right thing every time. I'm
sorry for what I've done, and, hopefully, people can forgive me for
it. If they can't, I don't know what else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us,'' Gordon said, ``have been in situations we
weren't proud of. You learn from situations like that on maybe how
to handle it better the next time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that (Stewart) does not need to get himself
in situations like that in the future. One thing I've learned is
you can't blame other people. You got to say, `What can I do
different? What did I do wrong?' And then always try to take
control of situations like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt's hauler was parked next to Stewart's at
Charlotte, and ``The Intimidator'' walked over on two separate days
to offer the rookie encouragement. Other drivers, such as Dale
Jarrett, also have given Stewart support during the season.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Enterprises owns the No. 43 Pontiac of John Andretti, who
wrecked in two separate incidents after mixing it up with Stewart
at Martinsville and Pocono. Richard Petty accepted Stewart's
apologizes, but he remains baffled about the situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as driving, he is doing a great job,'' Petty said.
``But he needs to work on his PR and personality. He is so
competitive, and when things happen, he blames everybody but
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is gonna sit down one of these days and realize that it all
ain't somebody else's fault. Once he realizes that and says, `OK,
I'll take the blame for a lot of this stuff' _ when it happens and
not after the fact, he'll be good for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is still a young guy,'' Petty said, ``and as time goes by,
he'll learn to control his emotions, and he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, in the first year of a three-year sponsorship deal
with the No. 20 team of Joe Gibbs Racing, feels like a lottery
winner after landing such a promising star. The home-improvement
retailer has stood solidly by Stewart through all the ups and down
this season, even after Martinsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine with passion, because we're a company with passion,
but it always needs to be morally appropriate,'' said Dick
Sullivan, Home Depot's senior vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want someone who takes losing lightly. We want
someone out there who doesn't want to finish second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company is (made up of) leaders, and we want to be ahead
of the pack,'' Sullivan said. ``Tony wants the same thing, and that
is why he is a winner, because of that passion.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stewart had a meeting scheduled at Home Depot headquarters
before the season, he flew into Atlanta early for an autograph
session in the parking lot. When it was time for the meeting,
Stewart delayed two hours so he could finish signing his name for
every employee in line.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is so focused on racing that he often becomes irritated
when he is approached by autograph seekers in the garage area.
However, he also makes it a point to walk over to his souvenir
hauler at least once every race weekend for an impromptu signing
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am in the garage, I'm here to work,'' Stewart said.
``That is why I make special time to go outside of the track. It's
important for me to be around race fans, because they have made the
sport what it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Quality time with the No. 20 crew also is meaningful to Stewart.
He and the team members travel to the bowling alley on Monday
nights and go on fishing trips during the early part of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend 150 days a year with these guys, more time than I do
with my family, so they are like family,'' Stewart said. ``It's
nice to spend time with them and meet their wives and children and
not have to talk about racing.''

 &HT;    Jones gains Winston 500 entry
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ Buckshot Jones has had a season full of
Winston Cup frustration, but he finally had something to smile
about on Saturday at Talladega Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was able to take an owner's provisional and land the 42nd
spot in the 43-car field for today's Winston 500. It will be the
Tucker native's first race on the circuit since Daytona on July 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man, it was nerve-wracking,'' Jones said. ``I thought we
were going to go home there for a minute. Man, it is good to be
back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   At Talladega, Jones is fulfilling a one-race contract with Eel
River Racing to steer the No. 30 Pontiac. He just missed making the
field on his qualifying speed of 193.897 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Eel River was able to cash in points earned by
various drivers in the No. 30 car this season and secure Jones a
provisional. Jones didn't have the same luxury when he failed to
qualify for Irvan-Simo Racing at Charlotte last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate missing a race, no matter what the circumstances
are,'' Jones said. ``It is always frustrating to go home early.
After what happened last weekend, and then coming here and be in
the race ... it feels real good.''
</P>
<P>
   Other drivers taking provisionals were Bill Elliott, Jimmy
Spencer, Geoffrey Bodine, Rick Mast, Brett Bodine and Ed Berrier.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip was out of provisionals and today's race will be
the fourth of the past five that the three-time Winston Cup
champion has missed.
</P>
<P>
   Jones started the season as a full-time driver on the circuit,
but decided to cut back in June because of disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   Eel River called upon Jones because it needed a driver with
experience in restrictor-plate racing. Crew chief Barry Dodson was
impressed with Jones from the spring event at the 2.66-mile oval.
Jones ran in the top 10 for much of the event and finished 21st.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, I think we can run in the top 15 (today),''
Jones said. ``I think this is definitely a top 15 car. I've just
got to be in the right place at the right time for it to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Today's race will likely be the last time Jones will be in a
Winston Cup car until the season-ending Atlanta race, where he'll
drive for his own team. Jones said he has so far turned down
opportunities in other cars for the circuit's three other remaining
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am basically going to stick with the Busch Series,''
Jones said. ``It's kind of tough for me, to go back and forth,
driving a Busch and Winston Cup car the same weekend. With me
running a full Busch schedule next year, I will probably stay with
that for the rest of the year.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR CLEMENS, SIGNS ARE BAD  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for rewrite throughout)   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was a bad day at the office he used to call home.
That's how Roger Clemens has to rationalize what happened to him
here Saturday at Fenway Park. The Yankees, whose margin for error
exceeds that of most teams, are still ahead by 2-1 in the American
League Championship Series. There could be another day, another
chance, for Clemens in this series.
</P>
<P>
   He just has to hope that day doesn't come.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens can spare us the brave talk, because if Saturday's
unsettling 13-1 Boston blowout was a portent of anything, it is
that Game 7 at Yankee Stadium on Thursday night would likely be
worse for Clemens than a thousand Saturdays in Fenway Park. If it
comes to that, if the Yankees do not win two of the next three, it
would be Clemens, holding the fate of the Yankees' 25th
championship, against Pedro Martinez, who is currently holding the
Yankees and the rest of the hitters in major league baseball
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clemens might become a rare topic of discussion on which
Yankee and Red Sox fans agree.
</P>
<P>
   The agitation in Boston over Clemens, Saturday's impassioned
jeering, was entirely predictable, if not a ringing endorsement of
the American educational system. Clemens left the Red Sox for what
amounted to a better business deal. For what reason, exactly, did
Martinez wind up in Boston after making a name for himself in
Montreal?
</P>
<P>
   (Here's a hint: the man of the people pulled up to the park
Saturday, dropped off to the cheers of the masses on Yawkey Way, in
a shiny white Mercedes).
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox fans, it seems, have never paused to consider what
the consequences of Clemens' remaining in Boston would have been,
given the constraints of the team's closely guarded budget. In all
probability, an investment of $8 million to $10 million a year in
Clemens, now 37, would have meant no Martinez, who is a decade
younger. Would Boston _ after what these pitchers have done this
season and specifically how they fared Saturday _ make that deal
even-up?
</P>
<P>
   In a more sportsmanlike world, which we obviously don't live in,
the Fenway fans would have applauded Clemens for the 13 years he
gave them, understood why he ultimately preferred Mariano Rivera to
protect his legacy, instead of Calvin Schiraldi, or Derek Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't going to happen, Clemens knew it, and so he resolved
to make sure his own retaliatory emotions didn't undo him before he
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make people not boo, but I will have to curtail my
emotions somehow,'' he said. ``I don't think I am going to be
afforded too many mistakes against Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clemens warmed up for the bottom of the first, thousands of
fans stood and chanted ``Rah-ger ... Rah-ger.'' It sounded all too
familiar to Darryl Strawberry, this being the birthplace of the
rhythmic ``Dar-ryl'' serenade at the World Series in 1986. ``It
ticked me off, yeah,'' Strawberry said. ``Then I kind of thought
about it over the years. It became kind of fun. I thought, `If
they're going to chant at me, I might as well thrill 'em.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Clemens proceeded to do, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   He threw ball one to Jose Offerman, and then his second pitch
was pulled, deep toward the short wall in right. Twenty-one years
ago, Lou Piniella was blinded by the late afternoon sun out there,
recovering in the nick of time to barehand a base hit and save the
one-game playoff for the pennant. This time, O'Neill didn't move
until the ball was over his head. Offerman wound up on third.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens ran the count to 2-2 on John Valentin. The next pitch
landed in the screen, over the wall in left-center. Seven pitches,
and another pitching matchup for the ages was over. Clemens
surrendered three hits and two more runs in the second. Hideki
Irabu was warming up. Martinez was already rolling, in a league of
his own, on his way to a 12-strikeout, 2-hit, 7-inning gem.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley singled to open the Red Sox third. Clemens threw
strike one to Brian Daubach. Irabu was ready. There was no point in
Torre's subjecting Clemens to any more, not when he had Irabu to
throw to the Red Sox wolves. Torre took a slow walk to the mound,
said a few words to his pitcher, took the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens took the longest short walk of his pitching life.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, when Yankee-Red Sox confrontations were
limited to the regular season, Chris Chambliss stood on third base
in this antiquated bandbox, having just driven in the tying run in
the ninth inning of a September game for first place. This was 25
years ago, yet Chambliss said he still could feel the point of the
object that came flying out of the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look down, and there's a steel dart imbedded in my arm,
right through the shirt,'' said Chambliss, the Yankees' hitting
coach. ``I could have been hit right in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens did not look up Saturday as he left the field, made no
eye contact with those who delighted in his demise. If he is smart,
he will not look back on this game either. The problem is what
could come next.

MARTINEZ DOES THE JOB WITH EASE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez grinned when one of his curveballs caused Chuck
Knoblauch to flinch, he glared when one of his fastballs sailed by
Chili Davis like a missile and he had never even glanced to his
right when Roger Clemens trudged in from the bullpen across shallow
left field while Martinez was flipping warm-ups in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had an incredible calm about him against Clemens and
the Yankees in the most important game of the season for the Red
Sox, a game that could have ended up destroying their season if
they lost. No team has ever rebounded from a 3-0 deficit during the
post-season, not even a team with Martinez. To keep this series
breathing, the Red Sox needed Martinez to dominate. He did.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees should be worried after Martinez humbled them in
pitching the Red Sox to a 13-1 victory Saturday in Game 3 of the
American League Championship Series. They should be worried because
Clemens looked scared and was gone by the third, because Martinez
continued to treat the Yankees like tense Little Leaguers and
because the Yankees allowed a frustrated team to feel like World
Series champions for at least one night. That is very dangerous in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The fans chanted ``Pe-dro, Pe-dro'' before Martinez had even
tossed a pitch and unveiled placards with K's and the Dominican
Republic flag or K's and MVP emblazoned across them. Martinez was
masterly while striking out 12 and allowing two singles over seven
innings, giving the Red Sox a jolt that they desperately needed and
giving the Yankees reasons to be edgy.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees could see Martinez again in five days _ presumably
Game 7 _ and, quite simply, they cannot touch him. Of the last 61
at-bats the Yankees have had against Martinez, they have managed
five hits while striking out 35 times. If the Yankees want to
continue defending their World Series title, the best thing they
could do is not let this series go beyond Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already got some fire in here, but, if we win today, we
could get a little more fire,'' said John Valentin. ``That's what
we're hoping for.''
</P>
<P>
   It was almost monotonous to watch Martinez operate. He rarely
strayed from the pitcher's rubber and he raised his arms high to
settle himself before almost every pitch. Then Martinez would bring
his hands together in front of his chest, step back with his left
leg to begin his smooth motion, lift the leg, pivot and throw
pitches that baffled the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez did not have his best fastball, but he had enough of a
fastball at an average of 90 miles per hour that it helped make his
changeup look like a golf ball and it helped embellish the break on
his curveball. The Yankees had to think fastball and react to his
changeup or curveball and they never looked like a comfortable
bunch. Martinez struck out every starter at least once except Scott
Brosius and Knoblauch and has 40 strikeouts in 23 innings against
the Yanks this season.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Martinez did when he appeared in relief in Game 5 of the
Division Series against the Indians and unleashed six no-hit
innings, he experimented in the early innings Saturday. The
170-pound pitcher wanted to know if he would be hampered by the
strained muscle in his upper back and wanted to figure out which of
his pitches were working Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most amazing thing is that he was able to take a
step down,'' said catcher Jason Varitek. ``He took a step back
against the Indians because he didn't know how he would feel or
what he would have. He went out, he made those adjustments and he
pitched well.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez did that against the Yankees as Knoblauch forced him
uncork six pitches before flying out and Derek Jeter lined a
one-out single to left field. But, after Jeter's single and after
Boston erupted for six runs in the opening three innings, the
Yankees might as well have started focusing on Game 4. Pedro, who
retired 20 of the last 23 hitters he faced, said he was ``100 per
cent positive'' that the Red Sox could beat the Yankees, and they
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``As capable as I am of beating any team, I believe my team is
good, too,'' said Martinez. ``You guys got to start having some
respect for my teammates. They are good. They are really good and,
if you don't believe it, you can analyze where you are right now
and it wasn't just one single man.''
</P>
<P>
   It only felt that way to New York's hitters. Once Clemens
imploded, life at Fenway became much simpler for Martinez. There is
a psychological edge that the Red Sox have whenever Martinez gets a
lead because teams then know how many runs they have to score off
the best pitcher in the world and it makes that difficult chore
even more daunting.
</P>
<P>
   There is one more psychological edge the Red Sox could have
soon. If the Red Sox can stretch the ALCS to a seventh game, Pedro
and Roger would meet again in the decisive game at Yankee Stadium.
After what transpired Saturday and what has happened this season,
would anyone bet against Martinez? Not me.

DIAMONDBACKS WILL FEAST FIRST  
 BOUNTY FROM FARM SYSTEM NOT MEANT FOR MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's the farmer's mission statement: Grow the crop,
harvest it, take it to market and get as much in return as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Down on the baseball farm, at least on the Diamondbacks'
acreage, the objective is similar in many respects. The main
difference is that the club isn't necessarily intent on developing
players just to take them to market and trade them.
</P>
<P>
   From the time they took their first breath, the Diamondbacks
always said their main goal was to put together a solid
player-development system. They began to develop some good, young
players.
</P>
<P>
   After the team's inaugural season in 1998, the team signed
several veteran free agents and made trades for other veteran
players.
</P>
<P>
   One trade in particular, the July 9 transaction that brought
right-handed closer Matt Mantei here from Florida, seemed to be a
signal to some that the Diamondbacks were going to start
surrendering some of their top prospects in order to plug in a
missing piece of the puzzle whenever the need arose. In this case,
Arizona gave up two top young pitchers, right-handers Vladimir
Nunez and Brad Penny.
</P>
<P>
   According to Diamondbacks General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr.,
there should not be too much read into that maneuver in suggesting
a possible pattern. Although the club should be somewhat active
during the winter, he said the team isn't going to mortgage its
future in order to satisfy its needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy has not changed,'' he said. ``We have a number
of exciting young players throughout the system that are not far
off from being able to help us, guys like Rod Barajas (catcher),
John Patterson (right-handed starter) and Jack Cust (outfielder).
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the Mantei trade was concerned, age was one of the
critical factors in that. He turned 26 after we got him, while
`Vladie' will be 25 at the start of next season and Penny will be
22 shortly thereafter. Mantei is older, but not by much. We needed
a good, young closer and that's what we got.''
</P>
<P>
   Another trade sewn with similar thread was the Feb. 26 deal with
Pittsburgh that saw the Diamondbacks receive outfielder-infielder
Tony Womack in exchange for Paul Weichard, a minor-league
outfielder from Australia, and a player to be named that eventually
was right-hander Jason Boyd, who was selected in the expansion
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony is 30, but a very young 30. The way he keeps his body in
shape, he's capable of playing another 10 years. We just saw a
player like that in Rickey Henderson (New York Mets),'' Garagiola
said.
</P>
<P>
   Having several veteran players on the club allows a younger
player to work his way in, not feel the weight of the club is on
his shoulders, Garagiola said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Atlanta Braves are a good illustration of that,'' he said.
``They have veteran players, but they've been introducing younger
players in along the way, where there's a little less pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``With us, Erubiel Durazo was a good example. It was not, `Thank
God, he finally got here,' but, `Here's a good, solid player who
will be able to work his way in and learn from the veterans.' When
he saw four guys capable of driving in 100 runs and three or four
capable of hitting 30 home runs, he didn't feel like he had to do
more than he was capable of at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Among some of the other top prospects: outfielders Jason Conti,
Rob Ryan and Garry Maddox, infielders Jarrod Patterson, Danny
Klassen and Junior Spivey, left-handers Nick Bierbrodt and Ben
Norris and right-handers Jeremy Ward and Nelson Figueroa.
</P>
<P>
   Now Garagiola is involved with the budgeting process and keeping
track of those players involved in winter ball. He will attend
three games of the World Series and then begin evaluating possible
trades and free-agent signings. The free-agent parade begins 12
days after the conclusion of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be the annual general managers' meetings in
mid-November at Laguna Niguel, Calif., and the annual winter
meetings, which will be held in Anaheim, Calif., beginning Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   While the Diamondbacks probably won't be as active during the
off-season as they were a year go, they're not likely to stand pat,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we really need to do is get closure on this
season, look at what made it the year it was and be critical of
ourselves,'' said Managing General Partner Jerry Colangelo. ``We
left a lot on the table. With all due respect to what was
accomplished, no one should be satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said as important as making any deals is the signing
of four players eligible for salary arbitration: left-hander Brian
Anderson, infielder-outfielder Andy Fox, Mantei and Womack.
</P>
<P>
   He said any deals this winter probably will be more difficult
because there aren't as many positions to be filled and many of the
players signed a year ago are tied to long-term deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the pieces have to fit,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence in our baseball organization to do what is
necessary. We have had some internal conversations already.''
</P>
<P>
   The key spots that need attention, according to Colangelo, are
shortstop and right field, and middle relief.
</P>
<P>
   Womack likely will fill one of the former spots. Whichever spot
he does not play will have to be dealt with accordingly. If he
plays right field, Arizona perhaps will sign a free agent or make a
trade. If he plays shortstop, the options for right field include
some from within, such as David Dellucci or the move of Travis Lee
from first base. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. - If ever a team appeared not to need a makeover,
it was last season's Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Blazers were loaded with young players, talent at
virtually every position and depth greater than any team in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   They swept the Suns out of the first round of the NBA playoffs
so easily that the Suns went to work retooling with the additions
of Penny Hardaway, Rodney Rogers, Oliver Miller, Corie Blount and
first-round draft pick Shawn Marion.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as the Suns changed this off-season, the Blazers
have changed even more. Tonight, the new-look Blazers and Suns get
their first look at each other in a preseason game that tips off at
5:30 at McKale Center in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   How good were the Blazers last season?
</P>
<P>
   If not for Sean Elliott's tight-rope three-point shot in Game 2
of the Western Conference finals that gave host San Antonio a
one-point victory over Portland, who knows? The Blazers might have
made a serious run for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   But it became apparent during the playoffs that Coach Mike
Dunleavy had juggled egos and playing time just about as long as
possible. And despite their talent, the Blazers still were viewed
from afar as the ``Jail Blazers'' _ a collection of knuckleheads.
</P>
<P>
   That was especially true of guard Isaiah Rider, who continued
his tradition of missed practices, shoot-arounds and planes that he
started in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   So club President Bob Whitsitt, the NBA's Executive of the Year
in 1999, got a quick start on defending that award in a whirlwind
of off-season moves that not only remade the Blazers but perhaps
their image.
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt shipped Rider and Jimmy Jackson to Atlanta for veteran
guard Steve Smith and guard Ed Gray.
</P>
<P>
   From a basketball standpoint, it wasn't a great deal for
Portland. No player in the NBA is more difficult to defend than
Rider. He dominated the Suns in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is an All-Star, but questions remain about the durability
of his knees. And his best days may have come and gone. But there
are no questions about the durability of his character, and
Whitsitt was wise to unload Rider.
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt re-signed his best free agent, young center Jermaine
O'Neal. Arvydas Sabonis is still the club's man in the middle, but
the job is O'Neal's in the future.
</P>
<P>
   He signed free agent forward Detlef Schrempf after the Seattle
SuperSonics made a low-ball offer to the 6-foot-10 veteran.
</P>
<P>
   He added veteran Joe Kleine as insurance behind Sabonis and
O'Neal, as well as for locker room leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of want to pinch yourself at night and check to see
if you got five lottery numbers or something,'' Kleine said after
the Blazers signed him.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``coup de grace'' was Whitsitt's trade of six players _
Kelvin Cato, Stacey Augmon, Gray, Carlos Roger, Brian Shawn and
Walt Williams _ to acquire Houston forward Scottie Pippen, who many
believed would wind up in a Los Angeles Lakers uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Only Williams and Rogers had much value around the league. But
Pippen doesn't come cheap. While the Blazers gave up little to get
him, they absorb four years on his contract that pays $14 million
this season and next, $18 million in 2001-02 and $19 million in
2002-03. Of course, that's pocket change for Blazers owner Paul
Allen.
</P>
<P>
   The end product is a team that still has its share of young
talent, such as O'Neal, forwards Rasheed Wallace and Brian Grant
and point guard Damon Stoudamire, who will be playing before a home
crowd when he returns to McKale Center, where he starred for the
Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   But it also is a team that now has veteran leadership and
stability as well as more defined roles for players up and down the
roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of guys who know how to play,'' Dunleavy said.
``We just have to get them on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it's still a team that looks good on paper until the
Blazers prove themselves on the court.
</P>
<P>
   If Pippen doesn't fit in, Portland could be this season's
Rockets. Houston looked like a contender on paper a year ago after
adding Pippen to two other future Hall of Fame players, Charles
Barkley and Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   It was a short-lived marriage. &QL;

EVANS DOESN'T GO EASY ON DEVILS ON 1ST DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - There was no Midnight Madness, but Arizona
State's young basketball team had to deal with Coach Rob Evans'
madness Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Evans ran the Sun Devils through four hours, split into two
sessions, at Wells Fargo Arena in their first day of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an advantage over everybody else,'' 6-foot-7 freshman
forward Donnell Knight said. ``It's just a matter of learning
everything the first few weeks. Once we do that, we'll be on
track.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's cram, cram, cram and jam, jam, jam, as six true
freshmen try to mesh talents with the veteran backcourt of senior
Eddie House and junior Alton Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Evans lost his top two frontcourt players and the bulk of his
scoring in Mike Batiste and Bobby Lazor, but this is such an
athletic group that Evans will be able to increase the tempo and
play the kind of pressing defense he likes with enough talented
players on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   House, a great shooter on the move and in a crowd, sees the
potential, the building blocks in place with what he calls ``the
youngsters.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Pac-10's top returning scorer doesn't want to have to
read about them in the NCAA Tournament a couple of years from now,
while he's playing professionally somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on this year,'' House said. ``We're not going to
let this year pass. This being my last year, I don't have a lot of
time working with these guys. We've got to make it happen. Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Things already are happening.
</P>
<P>
   This talent level hasn't been at ASU since the Mario Bennett
days.
</P>
<P>
   And the freshmen possess a certain swagger on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Batiste was a great player and Lazor was a great player, so
you can't compare these youngsters right now with full mature
men,'' House said.
</P>
<P>
   Only Duke and Northwestern in Division I have as many true
scholarship freshmen as the Sun Devils, who could start as many as
two freshmen, Evans said. He'll have no choice but to start one
freshman with only four players back from last year's sub-.500
team.
</P>
<P>
   Vying for spots are Knight, forwards Shawn Redhage and Tommy
Smith and swingman Tanner Shell. Knight, Smith and Shell, all from
the Valley, have spent a lot of time together since the end of
their high school seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody had their little talk with Coach, going over what
every body is going to do, going over their roles,'' Knight said.
``Some guys can shoot. Some guys can dribble. We're going to mix it
up. Coach really believes that the freshmen are going to do some
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman point guard Kyle Dodd, a thin 6-footer, looks no more
imposing than a ballboy, but he has a 40-inch vertical that helped
him win three dunk contests during his high school years in the Los
Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   He could push Mason for minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll be able to push the ball up a lot,'' Dodd
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shell, who grew another inch to 6-6, showed no ill effects from
reconstructive surgery on his left ankle that kept him from having
full-speed workouts in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared quick, got into teammates' faces on defense and
showed an accurate jumper against pressure beyond the three-point
arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we keep going, I'll be able to get my legs more into the
shot,'' Shell said. ``The one thing I worked on was my quickness.
My foot speed will help on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the responsibility can fall on House's shoulders, Evans
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have any success, (the freshmen) have to step up,'' Evans
said. ``But I think that they will because they want to.'' &QL; 
Note &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Center/forward Derek Dawes, a 6-10, 225-pound center from Salt
Lake City Cottonwood High who averaged 18 points and 12 rebounds
last season, attended ASU's practice Saturday. He was making his
last recruiting trip. Dawes also has visited Brigham Young, Ohio
State and San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here,'' said Dawes, who added he'll likely make his
decision in two weeks. &QL;

LODUCA HOPES TO PICK UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Los Angeles Dodgers catcher Paul LoDuca is hoping to
begin next season the way he ended this one: healthy and hitting
well.
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca, the former Glendale Apollo High and Arizona State star
who is back home, playing for the Peoria Javelinas in the Arizona
Fall League, started last season 2 for 39 at the plate for the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was falling in,'' he said. ``I wasn't swinging the bat
too good.''
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca spent nearly two months on the disabled list, but came
back strong in August, hitting .360 the rest of the year upon his
return to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca had a home run and three RBIs and was hitting .667 in
three games in the Arizona Fall League.
</P>
<P>
   He said he figures the Dodgers, who underachieved in '99, will
be much better next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those years where a lot of stuff didn't go our
way,'' he said. ``I'm sure we'll be fine next year. A lot of fans
are down on us, but it happens that way. You have your good years
and bad years. We're just as good as anybody in baseball.'' &QL; 
Out of the papers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   San Diego Padres second baseman David Newhan, who is playing for
Peoria, understands the press. His father, Ross Newhan, is the
``Los'' ``Angeles Times''' national baseball writer.
</P>
<P>
   He never got any special pub from Dad, growing up in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes care of the big boys,'' said David, who hit a home
run against the Diamondbacks late in the season after being called
up a third time this year. &QL; 
Weekly honors &QL; 
Scottsdale Scorpions outfielder Jack Cust (property of the
Diamondbacks) and Mesa's Matt Miller (Rangers) were named Arizona
Fall League player and pitcher of the week for Oct.5-11.
</P>
<P>
   Cust, who is hitting better than .400, hit his first ever
inside-the-park home run at Mesa's HoHoKam Park on Tuesday. &QL; 
`D-Backs series' &QL; 
Third baseman Matt Williams will continue the ``Diamondbacks
Series'' by appearing at Scottsdale Stadium on Wednesday night at
7.
</P>
<P>
   Other Diamondbacks making special appearances during the Fall
League season are:
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Todd Stottlemyre (Oct.24 at Scottsdale at 1 p.m.),
infielder/outfielder Tony Womack (Oct.29 at Scottsdale at 7 p.m.)
and left fielder Luis Gonzalez (Oct.30 at Scottsdale at 1 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Former Chicago Cubs second baseman Ryne Sandberg, a Valley
resident, will appear Thursday night at 7 at Mesa HoHoKam Park.
</P>
<P>
   The guests will sign 100 baseballs that will be given away in
random drawings to fans in attendance. &QL; 
On the air &QL; 
Cox Channel 9 will broadcast games every Wednesday with George
Allen and D-Backs radio analyst Rod Allen providing the
description.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda spent an inning in the
broadcast booth with the Allens (no relation) last Wednesday from
Phoenix Municipal Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Around the league &QL; 
Pitcher Rick Heiserman of the Cardinals will file a weekly diary
for the Fall League Web site at www.majorleaguebaseball.com.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale second baseman Mo Bruce (Mets) hit fort the cycle on
Wednesday, going 4 for 6 with three runs scored and six RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Maryvale outfielder George Lombard (Braves) hammered three home
run on Wednesday. He was leading the league with four homers.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix first baseman Sean McNally (Royals) hit .500 with two
home runs during an eight-game hitting streak. &QL; 
D-Backs report &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A look at how the Diamondbacks prospects are doing after the
league's first two weeks:
</P>
<P>
   Cust was hitting .419.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Jeff Andrews had a 16.62 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Eric Knott pitched one inning in relief against Peoria
on Thursday, giving up three hits, three earned runs with one walk
and no strikeouts. His overall ERA was 8.31.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Ben Norris had 7.71 ERA. Right-hander Jeremy Ward was
0-0 with a 1.93 ERA in 4 innings. He had given up three hits, one
earned run, walked one and struck out four in four appearances. &QL;

6 TEAMS LOOKING TO HIRE MANAGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been quite a while since this many managerial jobs were
open at one time. Just as Detroit hired  &UR; Phil Garner, the job in
Cleveland became available after General Manager  &UR; John Hart finally
fired  &UR; Mike
 &UR; Hargrove, something he's been on the verge of doing several times
in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   As of this morning, there were openings in six cities.
Baltimore, Cleveland, Anaheim, Colorado, Milwaukee and the Chicago
Cubs are all without a manager. In some cases, it's understood that
change was necessary, even if the manager fired was truly not to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs appeared less than enthusiastic for most of the final
three months, winning less than one-third of their games while  &UR; Jim
 &UR; Riggleman was on his way to getting canned.
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore,  &UR; Ray Miller really never had control of what, by
all accounts, is the absolute worst clubhouse in the majors. In
Anaheim,
 &UR; Terry Collins met a similar fate.
</P>
<P>
   Managing a major league club is definitely one of the most
glamorous jobs that exist in professional sports. At the very
least, it's the only one where the head man gets to wear the same
uniform as his players.
</P>
<P>
   At its worst, though, the big league manager is the loneliest
job in the world. The old saying definitely applies to this job:
Every manager is hired, just so he can be fired. The 1999 season
has shown that to be truer than any in recent seasons. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who has the lowest ERA in League Championship Series history
(minimum of 15 innings pitched)? &QL; 
Reeling Rangers &QL; 
The Texas Rangers may have won a franchise-record 95 games in 1999,
but after being eliminated in the first round by the Yankees for
the third time in four years, it appears owner  &UR; Tom Hicks has seen
enough of this particular bunch of Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, as they have been known for the past few years,
appear ready to be broken up during the winter. The Rangers expect
to lose $15 million for the just-concluded season, and with a $76
million payroll, something has to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we're not going to be able to keep this team
together,'' General Manager  &UR; Doug Melvin said. ``I anticipate the
(payroll) will be cut, and that's fine. Somewhere along the line,
we have to break in some young kids. You are in a position now
where you have to listen if teams call on almost anybody. You have
to have an open ear for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, at the top of the Rangers' list of players
ready to be traded is two-time MVP  &UR; Juan Gonzalez, who is due to
become a free agent after the 2000 season. Third baseman  &UR; Todd
Zeile and second baseman  &UR; Mark McLemore are probably gone, as is
center fielder  &UR; Tom
 &UR; Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may come a time when you make some changes,'' Melvin
said. ``You just hope that you don't make emotional decisions that
end up hurting you long term. You don't want to over-exaggerate.'' &QL; 
The greatest of the greatest &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball's all-century team will be announced
before the start of Game 1 in the World Series next Saturday. The
promotion, being sponsored by MasterCard, was a huge hit among
fans, especially on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The write-in votes were led by  &UR; Ryne Sandberg's 18,170.  &UR; Sammy
Sosa (14,400) was next, and then came Diamondbacks starter and
possible Cy Young Award winner  &UR; Randy Johnson, who received 10,780
write-in votes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ken Shouler, the senior editor at Total Sports, the company
that publishes ``Total Baseball,'' the official encyclopedia of
Major League Baseball, thinks four names were left off the list of
the greatest 100 players of all time.
</P>
<P>
   He points to  &UR; Wade Boggs, who has the highest average ever at
his position;  &UR; Gaylord Perry, a two-time Cy Young winner;  &UR; Ferguson
Jenkins, who won 20 games in six straight seasons; and  &UR; Dave
Winfield, who has the highest home run total of anyone not on the
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any other sport could create this kind of
excitement,'' Shouler said. ``Baseball honors its past players in a
way others don't. The names just keep coming down and have momentum
of their own.'' &QL; 
It's only plastic &QL; 
The Cincinnati Reds appear headed for some serious sparring with
their in-town NFL brothers, the Cincinnati Bengals. The Reds want
to tear out the artificial turf at Cinergy Field after the current
football season and replace it with natural grass.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals should care less, considering they will move into a
new, football-only facility next door for the 2000 season.
Inexplicably, they are blocking the move, which the Reds are
willing to pay for and for which they have received permission from
both the city and county.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals General Manager  &UR; Mike Brown steadfastly says no to the
move, unless the Reds rearrange their 2000 schedule to be out of
town during home Bengals games in late August and all of September.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals and Reds each have a 50 percent say in anything that
happens at Cinergy Field, and since the Bengals don't technically
move into their new home until next August, they retain their say
until then. &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
Former Oakland pitcher  &UR; John ``Blue Moon'' Odom's 0.40 ERA in 22
innings is the lowest mark among pitchers since the League
Championship Series format was introduced in 1969. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; If he was checking for pastrami sandwiches, the K-9
 &UR; might have been busy: Before the start of Game 3 in the National
League Championship Series at Shea Stadium, a bomb-sniffing dog
made a sweep through the press box, checking out reporters' bags.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wonder if anyone explained to the kid what it's
 &UR; really like pitching in Coors Field?: The Colorado Rockies signed
18-year-old Taiwanese pitcher  &UR; Tsao Chin-Hui last week, giving him
a franchise-record $2.2 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Donn Clendenon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Seven definitely was not his lucky number: Former Cleveland
Manager  &UR; Mike Hargrove fell just seven victories short of becoming
the Indians' all-time winningest manager. Hargrove wound up with
721 wins, second to  &UR; Lou Boudreau's 728.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Something the Diamondbacks are very aware of: In their three
recent playoff series, Texas leadoff hitters _ which include  &UR; Mark
McLemore,  &UR; Darryl Hamilton,  &UR; Tom Goodwin and  &UR; Royce Clayton _ are a
combined 5 for 30. Worse yet, none of the Rangers leadoff hitters
scored a run in the club's 10 playoff games. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Just a few of the reasons the favored Cleveland Indians were
bounced from the playoffs last week by Boston: Indians relievers.
Here were the ERAs of Indians relievers:  &UR; Paul Assenmacher
(27.00), &UR; Steve Reed (30.86),  &UR; Ricardo Rincon (40.50),  &UR; Paul Shuey
(11.25),  &UR; Jaret
 &UR; Wright (22.50). How bad was it? The Red Sox, who won the series,
had a 6.02 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   If a money pitcher is truly defined by how well he performs in
the playoffs, then the Cuban tandem of  &UR; Orlando and  &UR; Livan
 &UR; Hernandez must be considered big-time pitchers. The half-brothers
are a combined 7-0 with a 2.04 ERA in 57 postseason innings.
</P>
<P>
   By hiring  &UR; Phil Garner as manager without opening the position
up to other potential candidates, the Detroit Tigers have risked a
six-figure fine from Commissioner  &UR; Bud Selig, who this year issued
an edict to interview minority candidates for all managerial
openings.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the club with the most victories in the 1990s
was the Atlanta Braves with 925 wins. The next two are also no
surprise, with the New York Yankees (851) and Cleveland (823) next
in line. The fourth-highest victory total for the decade, however,
belonged to the Chicago White Sox, who had 816 wins.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gary Sheffield joined  &UR; Duke Snider as the only Dodgers ever to
hit .300 with 30 home runs, 100 RBIs, 100 runs scored and 100
walks. Sheffield, who did not play in either of the final two
games, hit .301, 34 HR, 101 RBIs, 103 runs and 101 walks. Snider
hit .309 with 42 HR, 136 RBIs, 126 runs and 104 walks for the 1955
Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Philadelphia Phillies joined the '67 Braves, '74
Royals, '85 Athletics and '86 Orioles as the only clubs ever to
finish at least eight games under .500 after having been at least
10 games over .500 in August. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
Don't necessarily look for the Baltimore Orioles to hire a
traditional-type general manager. This is a club whose owner serves
as the end-all for every baseball decision. Expect special
assistant  &UR; Syd Thrift, whom many blame for GM  &UR; Frank Wren's firing,
to take over as  &UR; Peter Angelos' top man, which he's been anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Once Atlanta's season ends, and that could be another two weeks,
the Braves fully expect to lose hitting coach  &UR; Don
 &UR; Baylor, who is all but a lock to take over the managerial job on
Chicago's north side, where the Cubs are coming off an awful
season.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of last year's controversial and mostly successful
trip to Cuba by the Baltimore Orioles, it appears the Atlanta
Braves may follow suit next spring.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; David Justice, who backed out of Game 5 of the AL division
series against Boston last week because of a stiff neck, may be on
his way out of Cleveland if the Indians can find a taker for the
$21 million he is owed for the next three years. Supposedly there
is one club willing to take Justice, who often sparred with former
Cleveland Manager  &UR; Mike Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   The just-retired  &UR; Jim Leyland insists his days of managing are
over. Nonetheless, it hasn't stopped Baltimore owner Angelos from
making a run at trying to lure Leyland back in 2000. Angelos may
try to make one more run at Leyland, who turned the Orioles down
last winter before accepting Colorado's offer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Willie McGee hasn't made it official yet, but he's probably
played his final game, at least for St. Louis. A slight possibility
exists that McGee may give baseball one last season if good friend
and San Francisco Manager  &UR; Dusty Baker asks McGee, a Bay area
native and resident, to play for the Giants. &QL;

MOVE OVER, COMPUTER MOUSE, HERE COMES THE FOOTRAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PACIFIC, Mo. _ Mankind, perhaps with the exception of
misanthropic hermits, dreams of creating the proverbial better
mousetrap _ some simple innovation to simplify life, make it more
productive and, perhaps, bring the inventor riches.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Thompson's epiphany came a couple of years ago while
playing solitaire during slow time at his computer programming job.
Thompson's reverie, since childhood, has been to devise something
that ``would knock the world on its ear.''
</P>
<P>
   That day Thompson looked at his computer keyboard, then his
computer mouse, and concluded that the two were essentially
inefficient. While typing, a user might need to use the mouse. That
would mean taking his hands off the keys, reaching for the mouse,
leading the pointer in the right direction, clicking the mouse,
releasing the mouse and then reverting to the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   From that came Thompson's better mousetrap.
</P>
<P>
   He calls it the FootRat.
</P>
<P>
   The patented FootRat is a black polypropylene casing shaped like
a very large soap dish turned upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the FootRat is covered with a nonskid substance that
gives the foot a firm hold. A Velcro strap can be attached for
added stability. The mouse is wedged inside the front section of
the casing, ball down, and held in place by a spongelike material.
</P>
<P>
   The gizmo is placed in front of the operator's feet and moved
around. The mouse inside does what mouses do, except it moves on a
roughly foot-square nylon floor pad, named _ no surprise _ the Rat
Mat. Thompson has also come up with two foot pedals, so the other
foot can click the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using it, you don't have to take your hands or eyes off the
keyboard,'' said Thompson. ``People who've tested it for me say it
takes a little getting used to, but it makes them a lot faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is selling the apparatus _ FootRat, Rat Mat, and pedals
_ for $89.95. The FootRat alone goes for $29.95, he said, and is
actually all anyone needs. A piece of cardboard can substitute for
the nylon mat. He has also written a free software program that
converts an unused function key into what clicks the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   As for a market, Thompson sees no limits once he can overcome
the seeming oddity of his product. Although most people are now
used to the keyboard and mouse, Thompson pointed out that many of
the controls on early automobiles were on the steering column
rather than the floorboard.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is eschewing print and television advertising and
selling his product directly over the Internet, at
{www.touchtime.com}. Sales, he said, are steady _ several a month.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he does have an immediate market _ those with
repetitive strain injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome, people
who through injury have either diminished or no use of their arms
or hands, and people with birth defects such as phocomelia.
</P>
<P>
   Phocomelia is a word that has Greek roots. The first part means
seal; the last part means limbs. It is a condition that occurred in
the late 1950s when a drug called thalidomide, touted as a wonder
drug for morning sickness, was marketed in Western Europe and
Canada. Seventeen American infants were afflicted; because the drug
was never licensed in the United States, their mothers took
physician's samples of thalidomide.
</P>
<P>
   The thalidomide children were born with a variety of defects,
the majority having no arms or drastically shortened ones.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend at a conference in Ottawa, Canada, Thompson's
FootRat will be put to the test by the some members of the
Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we like about it so far is that it's simple,'' said
Randolph Warren, chief executive officer of the association.
``Simple is good. And it's cheap. What we'll do here is have people
strap it on and have at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren, whose legs end at his knees _ his mother took just two
thalidomide pills during her pregnancy _ said 75 percent of his
membership lacks normal arms. Something like the FootRat would be a
boon, he said, since they now operate their computers and mouses
with their feet anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said his product probably just skirts the edge of high
tech. And that's only because of the software program he's written
to improve its functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to these inventors get-togethers, and you see very little
technology stuff here in Missouri,'' he said. ``About as close as
you come is some guy who's figured out a way to tether a soccer
ball to his foot so he can practice his kicking without having to
chase the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Backyard inventors such as Thompson, creative as they are,
probably are far and few between, said Robert Jones, director of
engineering services at the University of Missouri-Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   But the region, he said, is pretty high-tech. Recent
developments include the creation of empty cells that will allow
cancer-fighting agents to be more precisely aimed at cancers,
electron beams that will kill E. coli bacteria and work on
detecting land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the studies now, he said, take place in university
settings as a collaboration between private industry and academic
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he thought the individual coming up with a
billion-dollar enterprise in his garage had been largely a media
creation, one fueled by the success of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates,
who, barely into their 20s, got in on the ground floor of the
computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Galas, a spokeswoman for the Information
Telecommunications Technology Center at the University of Kansas,
said the center was working to coax more information onto
fiberoptic lines, developing wireless communications and even
developing a virtual room controlled by computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All sorts of stuff is going on,'' she said. ``But it doesn't
get a lot of coverage. We're trying to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Thompson, he's had a nice blurb in the Circuits section
of The New York Times. The FootRat also has been reviewed in some
trade journals. One complained that the FootRat took too long to
get used to.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson shrugged off the critics, likening them to those who
grouse about how hard it is to learn to drive a stick shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the computer is so important that there have to be
better and better ways to use it,'' he said.

UCLA DEFENSE: 3 AND OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ UCLA cornerback Ryan Roques sat on the floor
in the middle of the Rose Bowl locker room, cutting the tape from
his ankles and wondering why, even when it feels like the Bruins
played well defensively, they still didn't get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   Cal ran 70 offensive plays and UCLA's defense was strong to
solid for the majority of them. The Bruins' defense was offensive
on three of them, however, and that helped the Bears beat the
Bruins 17-0 on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look and think you're playing a good game, doing your
assignments right, and next thing you know you see some guy running
down the field,'' Roques said. ``You play such a good game, but on
certain plays somebody botched their assignment. You look back and
see a couple of plays. It's never a good thing when you can look
back and think of those plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Exceptional defenses don't look back. Cal's defense is the best
in the Pacific-10, and it's not recounting what went wrong. That's
not the case with UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The blown coverages and atrocious breakdowns that eventually
destroyed UCLA's season a year ago are gone. Now, players are
usually in position, but fail to swat away the pass or make the
tackle. The defense, which allowed Cal one more point than it was
averaging, continues to falter in key situations.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago it was a wide-receiver screen in the last minute
against Arizona State in a one-point loss. Last week, if not for
the clock, the same fate would have been met. Instead, after nearly
blowing a 24-point lead, the Bruins won when Oregon was stopped on
the 1-yard line on the game's final play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you went back and sat down and dissected those games, and
you made two columns that said `The defense was good on that play,'
and `The defense broke down on that play,' it would be loaded to
the good side,'' UCLA defensive coordinator Bob Field said. ``Every
game comes down to three, four, five plays. That's what it came
down to against Arizona State and Oregon.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragic number against the Bears was three plays. Two of them
went for touchdowns. The other set up a score.
</P>
<P>
   The first came when Cal's receivers weren't jammed at the line
of scrimmage, which left safety Eric Whitfield to choose between a
pair of receivers to cover. It resulted in Kyle Boller's 27-yard
touchdown pass to Jay Echma in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The other two came during Cal's game-clinching touchdown drive
in the fourth. Boller, a freshman from Hart High, connected with
Sean Currin for 39 yards on a third-and-26 to the UCLA 18.
Penalties pushed Cal back to the 33, but on third-and-25 tailback
Saleem Muhammad broke two tackles and scored on a draw designed
merely to bring the Bears back within field-goal range.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plays here and there, you think you're getting things
done, and we don't get off the field,'' sophomore defensive tackle
Ken Kocher said. ``Maybe it's that we have to play harder on third
down.''

DROP THE PUCK AND LET THEM PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has any professional sport undergone more changes in the past
few years than the NHL?
</P>
<P>
   Every year, it's something new under the direction of
Commissioner  &UR; Gary Bettman and his staff, which seems intent on
Americanizing the game at every turn, in hopes of boosting hockey's
marketability.
</P>
<P>
   There was the crackdown on obstruction calls. The Olympics. The
introduction of the two-referee system. The in-the-crease rule has
changed umpteen times. Overtimes are now decided by four-on-four
play. Teams now get a point even if they lose in overtime. And
expansion teams are coming out the NHL's ears, left and right.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, the league has had more face lifts than  &UR; Phyllis
 &UR; Diller. But the biggest one might be just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   According to league sources, the NHL is tinkering with the idea
of banning fighting altogether. It could be on the agenda when the
league's Board of Governors meets in December in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's too early to know just how the NHL will address this
controversial subject, assuming it ever gets off the ice, players
no doubt will face automatic suspensions for dropping their gloves.
No more five minutes in the penalty box. Try five ``games'' without
a ``paycheck''.``''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the more urgent talk I've heard on this is taking
the instigator penalty out of the game, which would mean you could
start a fight and not be shorthanded,'' Coyotes General Manager
 &UR; Bobby
 &UR; Smith said. ``The fighter's ability to police attacks on the top
players is getting hampered by the fact that if you start a fight,
you get a two-minute penalty and a game misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in talking to general managers and a lot of players, my
feeling is they'd rather allow fights to start as opposed to
eliminating them completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in the view of  &UR; Bob Gainey, the general manager of the
Dallas Stars. He wants to see what the NHL would look like without
fisticuffs. Period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're predicting all these things would happen without
knowing,'' Gainey said. ``Why don't we find out? We can always put
it back in. To say that we have to allow fighting because there
would be injustices, to me is like the courts didn't give someone a
big enough fine so it's OK to go firebomb his house.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be asinine to eliminate fighting one year and then
allow it the next. The NHL must be careful here. Fighting has
dropped some 20 percent the past two years already, an encouraging
sign. But the threat of it keeps things in balance. Don't kid
yourself. Smith isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the college game today,'' he said. ``Guys play with
masks and there's no fighting. But the amount of chippiness after
the play and the time it takes between faceoffs, I don't like the
way that game looks.'' &QL; 
Cool Hand Luc &QL; 
When the Los Angeles Kings made him their ninth pick in the 1984
NHL draft, the 171st player selected overall, nobody could have
imagined where  &UR; Luc Robitaille would be today:
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal-born Robitaille is on the threshold of tying
 &UR; Maurice  &UR; ``Rocket'' Richard, one of the best players in the history
of the fabled Montreal Canadiens and the NHL, in career goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that,'' said Robitaille, whose seven goals in
six games for the Los Angeles Kings tied him for the NHL lead this
season. ``That certainly was the guy. He was a special player. He's
more than a player to most of us back there. To be near him in any
kind of statistic is pretty special. It certainly would be an honor
if I can pass him.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille had 524 career goals entering the weekend, 20 shy of
Richard, who ranks 17th on the NHL's all-time list. That's pretty
good company. And remember, last season the NHL created a new
trophy in Richard's honor, which is presented each year to the
league's goal-scoring champion. &QL; 
Three's the charm &QL; 
Another Kariya has made it to the NHL, and yet another is carrying
on the family legacy at the University of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Paul Kariya's little brother  &UR; Steve is a Vancouver Canucks
rookie who finished second in the league in scoring with two goals
and 10 assists in six preseason games. He captained Maine to the
NCAA championship last season, leading the team with 27 goals and
65 points in 41 games.
</P>
<P>
   Now,  &UR; Marty Kariya is set to begin his college career at Maine.
Maybe it won't be long before all three brothers are skating in the
NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Marty) sees the ice real well, and he's a great passer,''
Steve Kariya said. ``I'm sure the Maine fans are going to love his
style of play.'' &QL; 
Movers and shakers &QL; 
Ottawa Senators owner  &UR; Rod Bryden might put the team up for sale in
December if he can't get more financial assistance. There's also
talk he might relocate the franchise to a U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   NHL guidelines, however, stipulate that the league must be
notified in writing by Jan. 1 two full years before such a move can
take place.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes fans, take note. If the Los Arcos arena vote fails on
Nov. 2 and owner  &UR; Richard Burke decides he can no longer operate at
America West Arena, where his lease expires after next season, he
must inform the NHL within the next two months if he has any
intention to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   Burke has said he won't move the franchise, but he also said he
has no Plan B should the Los Arcos project get scrubbed. &QL; 
Around the league &QL; 
What's it take to be considered a great goal scorer in the NHL?
Used to be 50 goals. Then it was 40. Does 30 qualify now in the age
of dominant goalies and trapping defenses? ``I don't know,'' said
the Kings' Robitaille, ``you'd have to go to arbitration to find
out.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Coyotes center  &UR; Bob  &UR; Corkum, an unsigned restricted free
agent, might end up in either Boston or Los Angeles by the end of
the month.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Devils Coach  &UR; Robbie Ftorek isn't a big fan of the new overtime
setup. ``It's not a true exhibition of the game,'' he said. ``It
doesn't matter if you get scored upon, because you still have your
point. Nobody cares. They just want to score, so you get all sorts
of craziness.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta recently finished a quirky road trip that saw the
Thrashers play, in order, at the Islanders, Tampa Bay and back to
New York against the Rangers. Said forward  &UR; Ray Ferraro, ``Somebody
at the league has their head up their butt.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Calgary prospect  &UR; Robyn Regehr, whose career nearly ended in a
July car accident that claimed two lives, is playing again, months
ahead of schedule.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Detroit is offering $5 million a season to winger
 &UR; Brendan Shanahan, who is in the final year of his contract. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Coyote  &UR; Chad Kilger has one goal in 22 games for Edmonton
following his trade a year ago from Chicago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Tampa Bay's  &UR; Stan Drulia scored last week against Los
Angeles, it was his first NHL goal since Nov. 23, 1992 _ seven
years ago. ``Believe me,'' he said, ``I knew how long it had
been.'' &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP FIVE &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. Dallas Should pick up the pace with Mike Modano and Darryl Sydor
are back from injuries.  &QL; 
2. Detroit Old man Steve Duchesne has been the Red Wings' best
defenseman _ better that Nicklas Lidstrom.  &QL; 
3. New Jersey Rookie Scott Gomez isn't feeling the pressure of
replacing holdouts Patrik Elias and Brendan Morrison.  &QL; 
4. San Jose Entering the weekend, Sharks had scored three times as
many goals as five teams.  &QL; 
5. Toronto We told you they were ready to spend some more. A Dmitri
Khristich signing looks close. &UR; BOTTOM FIVE &QL; 
 &QL; 
28. Tampa BayAt least the Bolts got their first win before
Philadelphia, Buffalo, Boston and Chicago.  &QL; 
27. AtlantaThe Little Brown Songbirds, a k a the Thrashers, became
the second expansion team in the modern era to get first win via
shutout. Florida did it in '93.  &QL; 
26. IslandersCoach Butch Goring has been retired for a while. Maybe
he should think about lacing them up again.  &QL; 
25. ChicagoGoalie Jocelyn Thibault has been getting filleted in the
crease. Will Hawks bid for Boston's Byron Dafoe?  &QL; 
24. PhiladelphiaSorry, Flyers fans. Until they show us a pulse, the
Fly Boys are a bottom-five club. ON THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; New York Rangers: Expect the Blueshirts to win their fourth game in
five tries today against Atlanta after opening the season with no
fizzle in their first three showings. Rangers got even better news
when it was learned goalie Mike Richter's bad back isn't nearly as
bad as initially feared. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Philadelphia Flyers: Chairman Ed Snider met with GM Bobby Clarke
for more than three hours the other day after practice. The topic
of the conversation? You name it. No wins. No goals. Bad goalie. A
possible coaching change. Possible trades. And we thought the
Eagles were bad. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Coyotes Coach Bob Francis, surprised that the NHL suspended center
 &UR; Jeremy Roenick five games for his slash last week to the face of
 &UR; Chicago's Tony Amonte: ``If that's the precedent, that's a heck of
a precedent. I've got a face like a half-chewed caramel. I've got a
whole year's worth of suspension in this face. On the same note, JR
was a little careless with his stick.'' &QL; 
SLAP SHOTS &QL; 
Could be wrong, but I strongly suspect this will be Mark Messier's
last year in the NHL. The Capt'n is in the final year of his
three-year, $18 million contract with the Vancouver Canucks and
it's doubtful GM Brian Burke will exercise the club option to keep
``Mess'' for another two years at $6 million a pop.
</P>
<P>
   The team also has a buyout, whereby it can pay Messier $2
million to walk away from the deal after this season. He'll take
it. Don't think his heart is in it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nieuwendyk acted as his own agent last week when he agreed
to a new three-year deal worth $15 million.``It wasn't that
tough,'' he said. ``I knew where I fit into the market place. I
knew how many years I wanted. And I knew where I fit into the team
structure. I'm not Arliss or anything, but to tell you the truth,
it wasn't that hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Paul Coffey, one of the NHL's good guys, was benched for
the first four games of the season by Carolina Coach Paul Maurice.
Coffey's skills certainly have eroded some, but give him credit for
not causing a stink. The future Hall of Famer said he promised
himself he ``wouldn't be bitter'' when this time came along. ``The
game owes me nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is a guy supposed to be great until he's 60?'' Hurricanes GM
Jim Rutherford asked. ``Guys get old, don't they? The thing I've
really been sensitive to is this: How does a great player's career
end? Some teams would just say, `Look, we don't want to pay the guy
anymore.' So they put him on waivers. We would never do that. We
respect his career too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye on Florida rookie Ivan Novoseltsev, who scored 57
goals last season for Sarnia in the Ontario Hockey League. They're
calling him the next ``Russian Rocket,'' and with the real
``Russian Rocket'' _ Pavel Bure _ out of the Panthers' lineup with
a groin pull, Novoseltsev scored two goals in his NHL debut. That's
one goal short of the league record held by Alex Smart (1943) and
Real Cloutier (1979).
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton power forward Bill Guerin could be on the trading block
after reaching an impasse with Oilers GM Glen Sather on a new
contract. (P.S. He'd look great in a Coyotes' uniform.) ``I don't
get it,'' said Sather, who's offered Guerin $2.3 million, about
$700,000 less than Guerin wants. ``(Buffalo's Miroslav) Satan just
signed a three-year contract for $2 million, $2.25 million and $2.5
million and he got 40 goals last year. Billy got 30. Is Billy
better than Satan?'' &QL;

STATE TRIES TO LURE FAMILIES TO FISHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza, an avid hunter and fisherman, was the
first to receive the new family fishing license at the Mayor's
Octoberfish last weekend at Encanto Park.
</P>
<P>
   The license was presented by Duane Shroufe, Arizona Game and
Fish director, and was purchased by Wildlife for Tomorrow, a
non-profit conservation group.
</P>
<P>
   Shroufe said the license had been created because of public
demand. Public surveys reveal that family participation in outdoor
pursuits is shrinking, and the new license is an attempt to reverse
that trend.
</P>
<P>
   The family fishing license, which includes trout, is available
at all Game and Fish offices. It becomes valid in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The license costs full price for the first family member ($22),
80 percent for the second ($17.60) and $2 for each child.
</P>
<P>
   Each member of the family receives a license, so that family
members can fish individually without the others.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good deal for families. Even if it's just husband and
wife, the price is of one of the licenses is 20 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
   The new license is in keeping with the department's commitment
to increase youth participation in hunting and fishing. &QL; 
Fishing regulations &QL; 
A survey of anglers helped sample opinions on proposed fishing
changes that will be considered at next Saturday's Arizona Game and
Fish Commission public meeting in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting will be held at the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge,
12851 N. 19th Ave.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers were asked how they feel about closing three creeks that
have no sportfishing opportunities to fishing. The three are West
Turkey Creek in the Chiricahua Mountains, lower Sabino Canyon in
Pima County, and O'Donnel Canyon and its headwater tributaries in
Santa Cruz County. Seventy percent of those responding favored it.
</P>
<P>
   About 72 percent favored closing Dude Creek near Payson to
fishing. The endangered Gila trout was introduced to the creek in
late September. Gila trout can't be legally taken or possessed
until they are downlisted from endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists think that could happen in as little as five years,
unless some unanticipated disaster strikes populations in either
Arizona or New Mexico, where the recently stocked fish were taken.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers were asked about proposed regulation changes on upper
Silver Creek and on a two-mile stretch of Oak Creek that spans its
confluence with the West Fork of Oak Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would add specialized fishing in more remote
portions of Oak Creek Canyon, providing artificial lure and fly
restrictions plus catch-and-release fishing. The proposal has
received tremendous support from the Sedona and Flagstaff areas.
</P>
<P>
   Special regulations for Canero Lake near Greens Peak in the
White Mountains drew 64.5 percent support from anglers.
</P>
<P>
   The lake would be open only to artificial lure and fly-fishers
with a limit of two trout.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 67 percent of the respondents favored a change at Alamo
Lake that would lower the possession limit on largemouth bass to
six from 12 and change the slot limit to no more than three bass
between 13 and 16 inches long.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular proposal (77.6 percent) was to change bag
limits for striped bass at Lake Mohave on the Colorado River to
unlimited harvest under 20 inches long, and 20 for those 20 inches
or longer.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal with the least support (60.8 percent) would
restrict the use of live bait fish at Kearny Lake in Pinal County. &QL;

GEORGE W. BUSH'S APPEARANCE AT FUND-RAISER DRAWS MORE CRITICISM
FROM ENVIRONMENTALISTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Slade Gorton in paragraph 2 and `Today' in paragraph 20 are
cq. ) 
 
 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ George W. Bush, already under fire from
environmentalists in his own state, drew more criticism Saturday
for raising funds for a senator championing the development of a
polluted, open-pit gold mine in a scenic Northwest national forest.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential front-runner, on the final stop of a
two-day campaign trip to Washington state, spoke at a fund-raiser
for U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and the Washington Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have roundly criticized Gorton, who expects
strong opposition from Democrats when he runs for re-election next
year in one of the most environmentally conscious regions of the
country, for his record on such issues as salmon protection, forest
clear-cutting and other uses of wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he slipped a special provision into a Kosovo and
disaster relief bill to help Battle Mountain Gold Co. of Houston
dig the open pit Crown Jewel gold mine on a mountain near the
Canadian border. The proposal, awaiting final approval from state
officials, would use a cyanide solution to separate gold from tons
of crushed rock. Environmentalists say the cyanide would
permanently scar the countryside and pollute area streams and
groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   The Crown Jewel, the first open pit gold mine in Washington,
would produce a projected 1.6 million ounces of the mineral over
the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Several environmentalists passed out informational leaflets
outside Safeco Field, the new home for the Seattle Mariners'
baseball team, where the fund-raising luncheon was held on the
outfield grass. Overhead, a plane hired by the Sierra Club flew a
banner reading, ``Gorton Strikes Out on the Environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Young, a Sierra Club representative, said the luncheon
demonstrated a ``common link between Senator Gorton and Governor
Bush _ that both of them are bad for the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Bush) hasn't done anything to demonstrate for us that he's
a champion of the environment,'' Young added.
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon protest was the second hit Bush has taken on the
environment in as many weeks. Recently in New York, Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore delivered a speech blaming Bush's
environmental policies as Texas governor for Houston's new ranking
as the only U.S. city with air smoggier than Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters inside the stadium, Bush and Gorton
defended their environmental records. Bush indicated he was
unfamiliar with the proposed gold mine but said Gorton was a ``man
who has sensitivity toward the environment.``
</P>
<P>
   Gorton's rider to the Kosovo and disaster relief bill, which was
signed by President Clinton in May, reversed decisions by the
Interior Department and the U.S. Forest Service that had denied the
Houston company's plans for the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said the earlier decisions had unfairly changed previous
federal policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a mining group that spent seven years and $80 million
getting every permit required under every state and federal
environmental law . . . and then had one federal bureaucrat,
unelected, change 100 years of the interpretive law of the United
States. That's not fair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said the mine would provide much-needed jobs to people in
Okanogan County, one of Washington's poorest areas. But
environmentalists say the ecological risks far outweigh the
economic benefits of the 144 jobs that the mine would create.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that if elected president, he would work with Gorton
and other senators to ``do what's right'' for the environment.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I don't believe in the command and control
politics of Washington, D.C. I believe the next president ought to
set high standards when it comes to clean air and clean water and
preservation of land. But I know it's important to work with local
authorities.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been criticized by environmentalists in Texas for
proposing a policy, enacted into law by the Legislature last
spring, that allows many of the state's oldest industrial plants to
continue to dodge some government regulations for upgraded
equipment and reduced emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``grandfathered'' plants, built before the 1971
Clean Air Act, are encouraged, but not required, to improve their
pollution control systems. But those that do not face no penalties,
even though Houston and other major Texas cities face serious air
pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   Some local Texas officials have contended Bush's appointees to
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission have not
exercised strong leadership against polluters. And, during Bush's
tenure, the Legislature scrapped a tough auto emissions inspection
plan.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush was speaking at the Republican fund-raiser on
Saturday, Texas first lady Laura Bush addressed the National
Federation of Republican Women's convention, also meeting in
Seattle. Today, Republican presidential candidates Elizabeth Dole
and Steve Forbes speak to the group.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush said it has been ``a thrill'' to campaign throughout
the country with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone asks me about George W. Bush, I say marrying him
was apparently the smartest political move I've ever made,'' she
said. ``Not bad for someone who didn't know a thing about
politics.``

   UNDATED: others to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Besides spinning off the merged companies' Internet backbone,
observers expect the FCC to require the combined companies to,
among other things, ensure that rural areas and inner cities are
afforded the same communication advantages flowing to major cities
from broadband technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Already, stories about unequal access to the Internet and
broadband systems that carry voice, data and video have resulted in
what is now referred to as the ``digital divide.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this mollifies consumer advocates, who feel betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've watched him (Kennard), and we're not very happy with
him,'' said Mark Cooper, a spokesman for the Consumer Federation of
America. ``We're very disappointed with his decision to allow
overconcentration in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   How this all plays out is uncertain. But the debate has focused
more attention on the FCC than at any time in its history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC's role is to shepherd this process from regulation
driving competition to competition driving competition,'' said
Robert Norcross, a vice president and telecom analyst at Pat Mercer
Management Consulting in Washington. ``Now, all these companies are
competing for a piece of the market. You don't want a monopoly, but
if you have too many competitors, you're likely to default back to
a monopoly'' because small competitors fall out and one company
becomes dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, he said, can benefit from all the jockeying. Still,
he said, ``It's up to the government to make that happen.''

DESPITE INJURIES, CARDINALS' SECONDARY BECOMES PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - It wasn't so long ago that irritated Cardinals
fans were of a mind-set to hurl decaying fruit at their team's
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been bad. No one back there beyond Aeneas
Williams could have intercepted it.
</P>
<P>
   You know you have career problems if you're a defensive back and
your nickname around the league is ``Toast.'' Yet except for
Williams, a Pro Bowl corner, toast they were.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three seasons, the Cardinals wisely have drafted
two cover players, Tom Knight and Corey Chavous, and have gotten
lucky with a pair of undrafted safeties, Kwamie Lassiter and Tommy
Bennett, to complement Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Presto. The secondary has been upgraded from Public Enemy No. 1
to NFC Pass Defense No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals now can afford to play more aggressively up front
because of the emergence of Knight and Chavous as cover corners
opposite Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals (2-3) were primed to show off their lofty standing
tonight against the Washington Redskins (3-1), who bring the
league's highest-scoring passing offense to the 5:20 game at Sun
Devil Stadium. Some of the luster has been lost because of
widespread injuries in the Cardinals secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got the No. 1 secondary against the No. 1 scoring team,
a classic match-up in prime time that everybody on our defense was
looking forward to,'' a chagrined Bennett said. ``Now we've now got
to find a way to step up to the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the team's five best defensive backs, only Williams and
Lassiter are healthy. Chavous has a strained knee. Knight, who
appeared finally to have overcome a non-stop string of injuries and
who is coming off his best pro game against the New York Giants,
was carted off the practice field Thursday after turning an ankle.
Bennett is getting a second opinion on his strained knee. Their
availability will be game-time decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Backups Pat Tillman, J.J. McCleskey and rookie Coby Rhinehart
become important players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norv (Turner, Redskins coach) likes to run lots of motion,
lots of movement stuff anyway,'' said Dave McGinnis, Cardinals
defensive coordinator. ``He counts on confusing defenses. No matter
who we have out there, they have to be extremely intelligent,
extremely patient. We have to be as aggressive as we can and not
give up anything big. That's the key to this.''
</P>
<P>
   When whole, the Cardinals are the equal of the challenge, Turner
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 thing that jumps out is they've given up very few
big plays,'' Turner said. ``If you don't give up big plays, you're
going to be in close games and the score's not going to get out of
hand. One of the things we've done well is not turn the ball over.
We've got to be careful not to turn the ball over. Then if the
opportunity presents itself, we've got to take our shots and try to
make some big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   New Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson was the Minnesota Vikings
starter last year until he became injured. He then watched Randall
Cunningham step in and direct the team to a league scoring record.
The Vikings didn't want to mess with success. They wouldn't give
Johnson his job back, but they did give him his requested trade.
</P>
<P>
   Through four games, which include three wins following a
season-opening overtime loss to Dallas, Johnson has not suffered an
interception. It's a big play every time he connects with wide
receivers Michael Westbrook (21.0-yard average) or Albert Connell
(20.8) on play-action passes, the fake being made believable by
back Stephen Davis' powerful runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like to get everybody involved in their passing game,''
Bennett said. ``They can power run, they've got a great tight end
and three big-play wideouts. A safety has to be very disciplined
against a team like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins have been particularly adept at getting defensive
backs to bite on the play-action fake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norv always has done a great job of play action, and play
action is what's getting Albert Connell and Michael Westbrook open
deep,'' McGinnis said. ``Plus they have a tight end who gives them
the vertical stretch that Norv likes and a quarterback who has
thrown zero interceptions this year. It's going to be a heck of a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a five-time Pro Bowl player, no longer has to carry
the load alone. At the opposite corner, a troublesome spot for
years, Chavous emerged late last season as a physical cover man and
Knight has shown flashes through his seemingly endless string of
injuries. Whoever isn't starting becomes the nickel back against
the increasing use of three-receiver sets.
</P>
<P>
   Behind them, Lassiter and Bennett each won a conference
Defensive Player of the Week award last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of know each other, it's like a marriage now,''
Williams said. ``In the past we had different guys all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   What he politely did not say is that most of them stunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt we can do a lot more, we can take some chances
because they now know some of the things I can do, and I know them
and how they play the game,'' Williams said. ``Kwamie and Tommy are
doing a tremendous job. They study the game. You should see them in
one-on-one drills with receivers when they come down with us
corners. I wouldn't be afraid to line those guys up against a wide
receiver if there was a situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Corey, you start with his tenacity. He really has the
ability I like to see in corners to respond after something bad has
happened. I tell young guys all time they're going to give up some
catches. Being able to respond is the vital factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight has responded to public ridicule of his injuries and to
being picked on by foes who avoid Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy always has been a good athlete, an intelligent guy,''
McGinnis said. ``He got hurt as a rookie, people started coming
after him, and he had a couple of rough games. Once you get
sentiment down on you, especially as a corner, you've got to be
pretty tough to bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams hasn't exactly become the night watchman, even though
teams often throw away from him. McGinnis often puts Williams,
Knight and Chavous on the field together and sends Williams on
blitzes _ including one that might have ended the career of San
Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve Young three games ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really made a concerted effort to study guys who blitz,
like Cornell Lake and Darren Woodson,'' Williams said. ``I wanted
to see why they do so well when they get opportunities. I've picked
up a few things so that when our coaches call it, I get kind of
excited. It keeps me involved in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   When the secondary is coupled with a pass rush that has produced
eight sacks and 30 hurries in 149 opponent passing attempts, the
Cardinals have made life tough on foes who are intent on passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't overestimate the importance of having three cover
corners in a defensive scheme,'' McGinnis said. &QL;

MERGER FRENZY PUTS FCC IN SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL WENSKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: As it prepares to dial into the biggest merger ever
attempted, the Federal Communications Commission finds itself at
the center of a debate over whether it goes too far _ or not far
enough _ in pushing an activist agenda on the untamed telecom
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates accuse the FCC of allowing itself to be
steamrolled by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC is asleep at the wheel,'' said David Butler, spokesman
for Consumers Union, which opposes the $129 billion merger of
Sprint Corp. and MCI WorldCom, the latest coupling to test the
FCC's fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly vocal free-market groups view events differently.
They say the FCC is exceeding its mandate by trying to micromanage
the industry by attaching conditions to the recent spate of telecom
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC is practicing a crude form of industrial extortion,''
said Adam Thierer, an economics policy fellow at the Heritage
Foundation, a Washington think tank. ``It is dictating the rules of
the road for this industry on a piecemeal basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Thierer points out that since the 1996 Telecommunications Act,
which sought to spark competition, the FCC has issued more than 497
final rules. That is more than any other federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides see danger ahead. Consumer advocates say
overconcentration of control in the hands of fewer companies
threatens consumer choice and access. Free-market advocates say FCC
meddling will raise development costs and reduce the innovation
that fuels competition.
</P>
<P>
   The debate could grow in importance as it plays out against the
backdrop of the Sprint-MCI WorldCom megamerger.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy stems from differing interpretations of wording
in the 1996 Telecom Act. The act requires the FCC to consider the
``public interest'' when reviewing the transfer of licenses from
one company to another. The act, however, fails to define ``public
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Crandall, a specialist on regulatory issues at the
Brookings Institution, said the problem was that the FCC
traditionally had ``a vague public interest focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the FCC has embraced the wording to expand its
authority. It was no coincidence that Chairman William Kennard
warned Sprint and MCI WorldCom that they bore ``a heavy burden to
show how consumers would be better off'' if the merger was
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, chairman since 1997, declined to be interviewed about
the FCC's new activist role. His predecessor, Reed Hundt, who
presided over the 1996 regulatory act and who is now a Washington
management consultant, defended the approach, which he called the
New Antitrust.
</P>
<P>
   He called the new approach, a kind of benevolently guided
deregulation, ``practical, pragmatic and progressive.''
</P>
<P>
   It supports rough-and-tumble competition, even if it develops
monopolistic tendencies. But it exacts promises from companies _
enforceable by fines _ to promote competition.
</P>
<P>
   The New Antitrust, said Hundt, is not about breaking up
monopolies. ``It's about monopolistic competitors sharing their
network efficiencies with other entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Telecom Act, the FCC mainly was a benign regulator of
long distance monopoly AT&AMP;T and the seven Baby Bells. It passively
approved the transfer of licenses, signing off on antitrust
investigations conducted by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   That has changed significantly. The FCC is more active, even
after the Justice Department approves a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a more furious and deregulated environment, the FCC is
likely to allow a merger but attach conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Hundt said: ``In order to compensate for the reduction of
competition that comes from the merger, the merged company must
promise to take pro-competition somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   If the merged entity fails to live up to its promises, the FCC
can force it to pay more than $1 billion in ``voluntary incentive
payments'' to the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that industry representatives are fuming.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC is using the process ``to shake down these companies, in
order to impose conditions supposedly for the public good,'' said
David Wilson, a principal at New Frontiers Communications
Consulting in Washington. Wilson, a former adviser to U.S. Sen. Bob
Dole of Kansas, counts SBC as a client.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the hyperbole, the assessment is pretty close, say some
FCC supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the FCC legally would be unable to enforce the
conditions, short of the companies consenting to them
``voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Telecom companies are more or less going along, Wilson said,
because merger delays can cost billions. He makes this analogy:
``If you want to crawl through a barbed wire, you have to bleed a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the standard of approval also has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Telecom Act, the burden was on the FCC to prove a
merger was anti-competitive. The new standard forces companies to
prove the merger is ``pro-competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, a former antitrust lawyer, does not hide his activism.
In a September speech to the National Association of
Telecommunications Officers and Advisors, Kennard said he had
devoted his chairmanship ``to the principle that all Americans must
have access to telecommunications services. ...And so we have
reached out to constituencies that never had a voice before at the
FCC.''
</P>
<P>
   Those constituencies have included rural and minority consumers,
as well as inner-city students.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers say activism at the FCC will get more of the
spotlight as the Sprint-MCI WorldCom merger unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts say the merger will go through, mainly because the
FCC has allowed so many others to pass. MORE

EAGLES FANS LIVE DOWN TO REPUTATION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Offensive tackle  &UR; Jon Clark, a native of Philadelphia who is
expected to rejoin the Cardinals this week, refers to the fans in
his hometown who cheered Cowboys wide receiver  &UR; Michael Irvin's
neck and spinal injury last week as ``blood suckers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark's teammate,  &UR; Lester Holmes, who played his first four
seasons in Philadelphia, says he knew Eagles fans were rough, ``but
I didn't know they were that brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody should be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Stadium is where the fans threw snowballs at Santa
Claus, tossed batteries at St. Louis Cardinals outfielder  &UR; J.D.
Drew and launched a flare at seats across the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has great hatred for the Cowboys, and I do, too,''
Eagles owner  &UR; Jeffrey Lurie said. ``But this is a human being on
the turf, motionless.''
</P>
<P>
   The city of Philadelphia has taken a beating the past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unspeakable, even for us,'' said a headline in the
``Philadelphia Daily News''.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to root hard, but it's a game,'' Philadelphia
Mayor  &UR; Ed Rendell said. ``Christ, it's a game. It's not going to
change fans' lives. How important is a game that we would cheer
somebody that may be getting paralyzed? It's inconceivable to me.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Charles Pizzi, head of the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce,
acknowledges that the incident ``certainly doesn't add to the
appeal of the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Pizzi said he thinks the fans who cheered as Irvin was placed in
an ambulance were in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   Those who monitor calls to Philadelphia talk radio shows aren't
sure that's the case.
</P>
<P>
   One caller said, ``The only thing that would have made me
happier is if it would have been a coffin, not a stretcher, coming
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Another caller said, ``I've been going to Eagles games for 30
years. I'd never had problems with any of the fans. I took my
7-year-old to the game, and he's a Cowboys fan. And when Michael
Irvin gets hurt, the guy next to me says, `Get the crackhead off
the field. Give him a needle. He's used to it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm ever going back to the Vet.'' &QL; 
Playing with fire &QL; 
Giants Coach  &UR; Jim Fassel, the former Cardinals offensive
coordinator, has taken a big risk by benching $17 million
quarterback  &UR; Kerry Collins after only one start.
</P>
<P>
   Team management thinks Collins is the team's quarterback of the
future and that  &UR; Kent Graham, an ex-Cardinal, is a career backup.
</P>
<P>
   Giants defensive players are getting tired of the musical
quarterbacks. In fact, linebacker  &UR; Jessie Armstead has advice for
Fassel on how to handle the starting quarterback situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get your mind made up and say, `That's your quarterback, cut
the bull out,' because you don't win no championship with no two
quarterbacks,'' Armstead said. ``You get your starting quarterback.
It's your ship. Now you drive the ship. No matter if you hit some
bumps, it's yours. I don't care who's back there. But let's make a
decision, let's keep with that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we put one quarterback in, if he don't do the job,
everybody around here starts hollering, `Put the next quarterback
in.' You can't win a championship like that. Block out everybody
and just make your own decision and don't let no one influence you
either way.'' &QL; 
Rookie feud &QL; 
Bengals quarterback  &UR; Akili Smith incensed the Browns when he
pounded his chest like Tarzan after throwing the game-winning
touchdown pass in last week's victory at Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was madder than Browns quarterback  &UR; Tim Couch, the first
player picked in April's draft. He was chosen two spots ahead of
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely angered me,'' Couch said. ``I'll definitely
remember that. And the way he was taunting our crowd, I'm saying
they should have picked him. That will stick in my mind. I'll never
forget that little move there.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith doesn't care if the Browns think he was rubbing it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he remembers it for the rest of his career,'' Smith
said of Couch. ``It was a big win. I really believe in my heart
(the Browns) made a mistake (in not drafting Smith). But there's no
doubt in my mind who the better quarterback is. Period.'' &QL; 
Battling the band &QL; 
Browns punter  &UR; Chris Gardocki was limbering up on the field at
halftime of last week's game against the Bengals while Ohio State's
band was performing its ``Script Ohio'' formation.
</P>
<P>
   Gardocki became trapped inside the large `O' of the formation on
the field's north side.
</P>
<P>
   He then punted a ball while band members circled around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Clemson, if I got stuck in the big `C,' at least I had a
way out,'' Gardocki said. ``I couldn't get out of the `O.' They
were running me over because they didn't want to break their
formation. Then I punted out of there, and I was afraid I was going
to hit somebody.'' &QL; 
Backing up his word &QL; 
Rams wide receiver  &UR; Isaac Bruce proclaimed in the preseason that
``when I'm well, I'm hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce, bothered by sore hamstrings the previous two seasons, has
22 catches for 446 yards and six touchdowns in four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ike's had two years here where a lot of people doubted him,
second-guessed him, questioned whether the hamstring was as bad as
it was,'' said Rams Coach  &UR; Dick Vermeil, whose 4-0 team is the only
unbeaten club remaining. ``People wondered, `Was it chronic? Was
his career over?' And all that kind of thing.'' &QL; 
Stealing them blind &QL; 
Ten years ago this week, then-Vikings General Manager  &UR; Mike Lynn
made the worst trade in league history, sending five players and
seven draft picks to the Cowboys for running back  &UR; Herschel Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The deal helped the Cowboys acquire such players as running back
 &UR; Emmitt Smith, safety  &UR; Darren Woodson, defensive tackle  &UR; Russell
Maryland and cornerback  &UR; Kevin Smith, all of whom helped them win
three Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys Coach  &UR; Jimmy Johnson referred to the trade as
``The Great Train Robbery'' in his book, ``Turning the Thing
Around''.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his opinion of the deal, second-year Vikings owner  &UR; Red
 &UR; McCombs said: ``I remember what I thought. I thought it was a
typo.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick kicks &QL; 
Quarterback  &UR; Steve Young isn't the only member of the 49ers
battling concussions. Cornerback  &UR; Craig Newsome, a former Arizona
State star, has had two concussions the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins, who enter today's game against the Cardinals with
the league's worst defense, are on a pace to break the 1981
Baltimore Colts' single-season record of allowing 6,793 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars are leading the league in defense for the first time
in team history.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers running back  &UR; Jerome Bettis, on the team's 2-3 start:
`(Pittsburgh) is not the place you want to live if you're losing
football games. So we have to win some football games or else leave
town.''
</P>
<P>
   Saints Coach  &UR; Mike Ditka, on the nagging injuries suffered by
Heisman Trophy-winning running back  &UR; Ricky Williams: ``There's
going to be no great healing process unless we put him on a plane
and fly him to Lourdes and stick him in the water over there and
bring him back.'' &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; THE TOP FIVE &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. Green BayDon't ever bet against Brett Favre in the last few
seconds.  &QL; 
2. JacksonvilleFinally, the Jaguars have a defense that's worthy of
their offensive talent.  &QL; 
3. BuffaloDoug Flutie isn't a flake, and the defense has been
terrific. 4. St. LouisNow every team is going to get its QB from
the Iowa Barnstormers. 5. New EnglandExcept for a botched chip-shot
field goal, the Patriots would be unbeaten. &UR; THE BOTTOM FIVE &QL; 
 &QL; 
31. ClevelandFinally, the talk of a .500 season has subsided. 30.
CincinnatiDon't expect veteran QB Jeff Blake to get his job back.
29. PhiladelphiaThe fans threw snowballs at Santa Claus and booed a
seriously injured Michael Irvin of the Cowboys. 28. New
OrleansCoach Mike Ditka says he won't retire. Then, how about
playing a quarterback not named Billy Joe? 27. CarolinaThings won't
get better for Coach George Seifert this week when he returns to
the Bay area. ON THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; San Diego Chargers: All along, Chargers officials said the team
would get better when they had a veteran QB instead of Ryan Leaf. A
year ago, the Chargers had the best defense in the NFL but won only
five games because of committing 51 turnovers. QBs Jim Harbaugh and
Erik Kramer haven't been brilliant this season, but the offense
hasn't lost any games for the Chargers, who still have one of the
league's best defenses. They also have a popular first-year coach
in Mike Riley. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Detroit Lions: Minus All-Pro running back Barry Sanders, the Lions
fooled us early in the season. Now, they're coming back to reality.
The Lions have given up 19 sacks in four games, including 10 the
past two weeks. A week ago, the Chargers had six sacks after
getting only four in their first four games. QB Charlie Batch is on
a pace to get sacked 76 times, which would the third most in NFL
history. This week, the Lions get WR Herman Moore back from a knee
injury, but he can't help them protect the passer. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
Dolphins OL coach Paul Boudreau, on the advice he has for Patriots
DL Chad Eaton this week: ``Don't put your hand in (Dolphins guard)
Kevin Gogan's face. He'll bite it.'' &QL; 
ODD-SHAPED BALL &QL; 
Two weeks ago, the Atlanta Braves scored 18 runs in the last game
of the regular season. They outscored 13 NFL teams that day. Last
week, the Boston Red Sox scored 23 runs against the Cleveland
Indians. The Red Sox outscored 19 teams and scored more runs than
the Arizona Cardinals have scored points (21) the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The only game last week in which both teams outscored the Red
Sox was the Dolphins' 34-31 victory over the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen teams failed to score at least 20 points. &QL; 
SHORT SHOTS &QL; 
Ten days ago, a day after Houston was given an expansion team, the
new team's Web site got more than 200,000 hits per hour. ``Cripes,
we're averaging more hits than any porno site in America,'' said
Steve Patterson, executive director of the new Houston team.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, quarterbacks Brett Favre, Mark Brunell, Ty Detmer and
Kurt Warner were in Green Bay's camp. Warner, who was waived, has
14 touchdown passes for the Rams, compared to Favre's seven,
Brunell's three with Jacksonville and Detmer's none with Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   How bad are things going for the Vikings? They had a 300-yard
passer (Randall Cunningham), a 100-yard rusher (Robert Smith) and a
100-yard receiver (Randy Moss) but still lost to the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's loss to the Eagles was the first NFC East defeat for
second-year Cowboys Coach Chan Gailey, who had been 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are 0-6 against Dallas on Monday night and have been
outscored, 188-82.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens Coach Brian Billick, on ex-Cardinals quarterback Stoney
Case, who has thrown three interceptions and two touchdown passes
and been sacked 12 times: ``Stoney needs to slow his fundamentals
down . . . He rushes his mechanics, his drops and his throws.''
</P>
<P>
   Browns kicker Phil Dawson last week became the first NFL kicker
since 1985 to score a touchdown. ``We heard you lying in the locker
room that you used to be a football player, but we just didn't
believe you,'' said Dawson, a defensive end in high school. &QL;

BLEDSOE VIEW CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ After all the yards and all the touchdown passes
and all the victories, two incidents have defined Drew Bledsoe to
much of the public in New England.
</P>
<P>
   The first came two years ago in Pittsburgh when he threw an
interception while trying to drive his team downfield as time was
running out in an AFC divisional playoff game that the Patriots
lost, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   After that game it was reported that Bledsoe was laughing in the
corner of the locker room while talking to his agent, Leigh
Steinberg. Bledsoe was vilified by many for something he never did.
His eyesight was questioned, but, worse, his manhood was, too, in
some corners of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The second incident came less than a year later when he became
the only quarterback in NFL history to win back-to-back games by
throwing touchdown passes with less than 30 seconds to play while a
metal pin stuck out of his finger to hold it together.
</P>
<P>
   After those two games, it was reported that he was one of the
three most courageous people in the history of mankind, ranking up
there with Audie Murphy as a war hero and Hercules as a mythic one.
He was lionized by many, his heart praised and his manhood
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the athlete's life in New England, a place where
appearance means everything and reality often very little. It is a
place where dogs are not the only things that can be rabid. A place
where you either flourish in the brightest of lights or are wilted
by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely some validity to that,'' Bledsoe said last
week. ``I think I understand the deal here now. There's been a
clear change in perception out there when it comes to me after last
season. I recognize that's the way it works. You either have to win
championships, do something outlandish statistically or do
something dramatic. I guess I settled for the dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's a backhanded compliment because I feel I'd
accomplished a lot before those two passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Those two passes beat Miami and Buffalo at a time when Bledsoe
was in considerable pain from a broken finger that was being held
together by baling wire. A week later in St. Louis, those wires
fell apart and Bledsoe kept trying to push them back together until
good sense finally sent him to the sidelines for the season. Soon
thereafter, his team fell apart as well, losing badly in the first
round of the playoffs and reminding an often hard-to-argue-with
public that the quarterback they so often had questioned and
criticized was their best chance for victory each and every Sunday
he played.
</P>
<P>
   Even that Sunday back in Pittsburgh two years ago when he was
doing anything but laughing after it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was such crap,'' Bledsoe said, his voice rising for a
moment before he drew it back. ``I was a mess after that game. It
took longer for me to get over that game than any game I can
remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny because when we took over at the 1-yard line or
whatever I was smiling. I was totally relaxed. I knew we'd do it. I
didn't have a hint of nervousness. I feel comfortable in those kind
of two-minute situations and have had a lot of success in them. I
feel comfortable there and I look forward to those situations.''
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't look forward to was the situation that followed,
one in which he was criticized and his devotion to the game
questioned. It was a silly argument from the start, one the
quarterback never could win were it not for the dramatics of a year
later when his finger fell apart and he played on.
</P>
<P>
   It was a character assassination that grew from the experience
of another West Coast quarterback who had wilted under the same
lights that now shine on Bledsoe. A quarterback named Tony Eason,
who had some good years here and even took a team to the Super Bowl
as Bledsoe has.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that was it. Maybe it was all too familiar to everyone so
they lumped the two together because they both came from that
foreign place known in New England as the Left Coast. Once, you may
recall, it had been suggested by John Hannah that Eason wear a
dress when he played, a suggestion that his manhood was a point of
debate among his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   No one who knows Bledsoe would make such an assertion and no one
has, but when someone thought they saw a smile where they wasn't
one, a Pandora's box was opened that was slammed shut only when
Bledsoe played with a broken finger and delivered victory as well
as drama.
</P>
<P>
   Truth comes out
</P>
<P>
   Patriots coach Pete Carroll said recently about Bledsoe, ``I
think the truth has come out. The truth is better known about who
he is and what he's all about now. That's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's more confident. He's just more self-assured
because he understands and he commands the game better than he did
earlier. He realizes he's the leader. He knows he's the leader.
He's not hesitant to speak his mind or shoulder the responsibility
when things don't go well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe has always been willing to do the latter since the first
game he ever started in New England in 1993. But he has not always
been perceived by the public as being in charge of his team or the
situation, not until a year ago when he played two November games
looking more like Edward Scissorhands than Dan Marino.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the doctors said he was finished, cracks had begun
to appear in the argument of those who for so long had questioned
his toughness and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three weeks in a row he did things most people wouldn't
do,'' Carroll said. ``He wasn't thinking about himself one bit. He
was thinking about competing.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, as he always does. He just doesn't show it.
</P>
<P>
   Not, at least, the way they like to see it in New England. He is
ice but not fire, calm without chaos. He is the best quarterback in
the AFC today and perhaps the best in football but New Englanders
like their heroes gritty, like that guy up in Green Bay who runs
around and throws caution _ and his body _ to the wind every
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Brett,'' Bledsoe said of Packers quarterback Brett
Favre. ``I love to watch him play. He runs around like a guy with
his hair on fire, making plays. Who doesn't love to watch that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I play differently than he does. I'm a pocket
passer. But on the inside we're not that much different. The
competitiveness. The willingness to take risks. We have different
personalities but all the rest is the same for both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   So are the numbers, except that Bledsoe's are slightly better at
the moment. Favre is on pace to throw for more yards than any
quarterback in history. Yet it is Bledsoe who is the top-rated
passer in the AFC and on pace to eclipse every career passing
record there is if he plays long enough.
</P>
<P>
   But can anyone last that long here in New England, where the
winters are long and also hot if you're a professional football
player and the highest-profile athlete in town not named Pedro?
</P>
<P>
   That is a question not even Bledsoe knows the answer to, but as
his seventh year in the NFL unfolds he knows this: He doesn't want
to look up one day as he will today and see himself in the role
Marino now finds himself playing, still searching for that one
world championship to cap off an otherwise flawless career.
</P>
<P>
   Sense of urgency
</P>
<P>
   Said Bledsoe, ``I feel a great sense of urgency to win the Super
Bowl for two reasons. No. 1, you just don't know from year to year
what can happen. No. 2, I don't want to have to be in my 17th year
and still be hanging on hoping to win a championship. If I want to
hang it up, I'd like to do it with no regrets. Without a world
championship, how do you do that?''
</P>
<P>
   As first John Elway and now Marino have proven, you don't. You
hang on. You watch some of your skills fade and your team change
and your coaches begin to feel safe in criticizing you. You hang on
until you finally win that game or you know in your heart you never
will. But if the latter is what happens, you leave with numbers
after your name but not the one thing all quarterbacks are defined
by in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``A quarterback, like a coach, is judged by his jewelry,'' Bill
Parcells used to tell Bledsoe, and he is right. Phil Simms is great
because his team won two Super Bowls. Dan Fouts is a guy in a beer
commercial because he's just a guy with numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Two perceptions of reality, neither probably accurate, but
perceptions they must live with. Playing pro football in New
England has taught Drew Bledsoe a lot about that, both good and
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot better understanding of the people in New England
and how important their sports are to them now than I did when I
first got here,'' Bledsoe said. ``I understand some of the history
behind it. It's not better or worse than the West Coast, it's just
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way I can describe it is I flew into Seattle one day
recently and there's Junior Griffey standing in the airport waiting
for someone. People would look at him when they went by. They knew
who he was. But nobody bothered with him. It's just a different
feeling toward athletes out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't judge which is better but if you want to be
anonymous it's better. Then again, there's no better place to play
than here if we're winning. The fans are into it. If you can ride
out some of the storms and people here see you're not going to be
run away you get some credibility with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I won't get booed out of the stadium again but
because I've shown them I won't hide and I'll play through a lot of
things they look at me differently. I'm not different. They just
see me differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my rookie year after I threw five interceptions
against Pittsburgh I made a point of going to read the papers and
(the Herald's Kevin) Mannix said it was the worst performance by a
quarterback in the history of the Patriots. I got a taste of it
then and I figured I could only go up from there.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he has. All the way to the top of public opinion in a
most difficult town. But none of it, not the day after Pittsburgh
two years ago or the season after The Finger Chronicles, has
changed Drew Bledsoe. Not where it counts, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never taken the public side of this job too seriously,''
Bledsoe said. ``The public side of my life is secondary in
importance to me. Not on the field, but off the field. The Drew
Bledsoe in the media is of very little importance to me. It's
separate from my real life. I like my life now but I liked my life
before football, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have the right personality for this. You can't
challenge every negative comment that's said or written or you'd be
in a lot of fights around here. I think I have the personality to
let things slide. That's helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely it has. But not as much as a broken finger and two
touchdown passes did, which says more about the place where he
plays than the player Drew Bledsoe is.

DON'T SELL SWANN SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - It's only one game. Twenty-five plays. Hardly a
trend.
</P>
<P>
   But if you had doubted the constitution of Eric Swann, how would
you like to line up across from him now?
</P>
<P>
   For a perspective on what Swann means to the Cardinals' defense,
just look at those 25 snaps against the New York Giants last
Sunday. Swann hadn't been on the field in nearly a year. The first
time he assumed his three-point stance, the Giants double-teamed
him.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't know what level of condition he was in, how strong
he was, how his surgically repaired arthritic right knee might hold
up, where he was mentally.
</P>
<P>
   But they knew they didn't want to chance it.
</P>
<P>
   That's respect.
</P>
<P>
   More respect than he'd received from many people around here.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the Giants gambled and single-covered Swann. He knocked
the blocker into quarterback Kerry Collins. By the end of the
afternoon, the Giants had assigned not two but three players to
account for Swann.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Simeon Rice what that means. Ask Andre Wadsworth. The ends,
who were having a decent season, became even more effective with
Swann's push in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Ron McKinnon how much easier a linebacker's job is when he
is clean to make plays because Swann occupies so many blockers.
</P>
<P>
   When Swann ran onto the field, 10 other defenders immediately
became better.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the physical part of his game. He brought more
than that with him to the practice field when finally cleared
medically for his long-awaited return. Others in the Cardinals
defense were visibly lifted emotionally. That carried over on game
day, when the Giants' scoring was limited to a late field goal.
</P>
<P>
   This evening the challenge is far greater. The Washington
Redskins have the most successful offense in the NFL through the
opening five weeks. They have a quarterback who hasn't thrown an
interception, a powerful running back, a pass-catching fullback
intent on making a point in Sun Devil Stadium, a tight end to
vertically stretch the defense, and two wide receivers averaging 20
yards a catch on play-action passes.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it work for the Redskins is their revamped offensive
line that includes a longtime nemesis of Swann, Tre Johnson. Like
Swann, Johnson has returned from injuries _ shoulders, in his case
_ a slimmer, quicker player.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a better barometer of where Swann is.
</P>
<P>
   There still are questions. His debut was in limited situational
play. Can the knee hold up when Swann resumes work as an every-down
player in two weeks? For how long? Does the microfracture procedure
work for a 317-pound professional defensive tackle?
</P>
<P>
   Those are long-term questions. In the short term, Swann has
answered the most critical question of all, regarding heart.
</P>
<P>
   There were people who thought that Swann did not have what it
took to return to the field after two surgeries last autumn, the
second the controversial microfracture in December. Swann's manhood
was questioned, his toughness, his dedication.
</P>
<P>
   He was ripped for leaving his teammates during a playoff run,
for not trying to play through in pain, for just wanting to make
sure he could walk at age 35. Walk is exactly what some talk-show
hosts suggested he would do with the $25 million, including a $7.5
million bonus, that he'd signed for in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   His was a long, lonely road. Swann toiled in solitude during
much of his rehabilitation. He heard the critics. It hurt him, but
he has resisted the urge to go off on them. Even now he shrugs it
off, saying they have a right to express their opinion.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how naive. &QL;

MARMIE CARES FOR DETAILS  
 HARD WORK PRIMARY FOR SECONDARY COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Then-newly hired Cardinals defensive coordinator
Dave McGinnis knew very little about the bespectacled gentleman who
applied for the position of secondary coach four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He was aware that Larry Marmie had been head coach at Arizona
State and been an assistant at several places but never had met
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Vince and I were putting this (defensive) staff together,
one of our main criteria was we wanted people who were very good
teachers and technicians,'' McGinnis said. ``Larry Marmie's name
came up on every list.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the Cardinals' secondary leads the NFC in pass
defense and is second overall, and McGinnis and the players give
Marmie much of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is organized,'' McGinnis said. ``The guy is a
communicator. He's the best technician as a secondary coach I've
ever been around. His organization is incredible. And he has a very
good eye for talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting strong safety Tommy Bennett, who played for Marmie at
UCLA, and backup free safety/cornerback J.J. McCleskey, who played
for Marmie at Tennessee, weren't even drafted. But the Cardinals
took Marmie's advice and signed both of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows talent whether it's a first-rounder or a player who
isn't drafted at all,'' Bennett said. ``He does a good job of
finding guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Marmie appreciates the compliments but thinks his influence has
been overstated.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bennett would have been drafted in 1996 had UCLA not
moved him to linebacker his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And J.J. keeps proving everybody wrong,'' Marmie said of the 5
foot 8, 180-pound sixth-year pro. ``He was even a walk-on at
Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   McCleskey describes Marmie as an ``intense competitor'' who is a
tireless worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our drills before practice are intense for NFL warm-ups,''
McCleskey said. ``He drives us a lot. He's very thorough. If
something goes on in a game and we're not prepared for it, he'll
say, `This is my fault.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very good teacher. He explains things well. He goes
over them and over them until we know them, and as a result, since
I've been here, there haven't been a lot of mental errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said Marmie is almost obsessed with making sure the
defensive backs know the fundamentals of playing the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just making plays,'' Bennett said. ``He makes sure we
know our backpedals, alignments, reads.''
</P>
<P>
   The defensive backs are extremely close, even though they are
from vastly varied backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Tom Knight, who is expected to start today against
the Washington Redskins, was a top-10 pick in 1997. Starting free
safety Kwamie Lassiter wasn't even drafted.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Corey Chavous is a converted safety. Strong safety
Pat Tillman is a converted linebacker who was a seventh-round pick
a year ago from ASU.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's perennial All-Pro Aeneas Williams, whom Dallas
quarterback Troy Aikman recently called the ``best cornerback we
play year after year.''
</P>
<P>
   It's up to Marmie to get them to mesh.
</P>
<P>
   Marmie has been through this before. He coached two terrific
defensive back groups at ASU _ Eric Allen, Anthony Parker and David
Fulcher in 1985 and Phillippi Sparks, Darren Woodson, Kevin
Miniefield and Nathan LaDuke in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (Cardinals) group mixes together well,'' he said. ``They
like each other. They enjoy playing together. . . . I had never
coached in pro football until four years ago and didn't really know
what to expect. But I've been really fortunate that I've had such
good guys, good people.'' &QL;

CONDITIONS COULD REVIVE CUP INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some think America's Cup all but died in the minds of the
sporting public because every image of competition since 1987 came
from San Diego, where Southern California's laidback zephyrs make
paint drying look exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coma off Point Loma'' is how the Euro-wags described the
1992 and 1995 Cups.
</P>
<P>
   After Australia's windy mayhem _ snapped masts, blown-out sails,
and the boisterous Fremantle Doctor that shrieked in the rigging
every afternoon _ San Diego may have had a story to tell, but it
had no great video.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN, which had terrific success televising sailboat racing to a
weary American audience that stayed up until 4 a.m. to watch the
Australian races, tried everything it could to spice up San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   At one point it created Frogman Cam. At one of the turning
marks, a diver was to shoot pictures of the keels sharking through
the water. Alas, Frogman and Cam once drifted perilously close to
the path of an oncoming IACC 75-footer and nearly got run down by a
15-ton lead ball.
</P>
<P>
   But give ESPN high marks for trying. And it is back on the air
Sunday at 2 (on ESPN2, actually) to provide, from New Zealand, a
preview of the 11 challengers who will begin racing Monday in the
first America's Cup trials to be held in 4 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Jobson will hold his familiar spot as analyst, and report
from Auckland on the challengers about to begin a racing season
from which will emerge, next February, the team that will take on
New Zealand in the America's Cup final.
</P>
<P>
   Those optimists who believe Cup interest died only because of
the unexciting television from San Diego now are betting that
Auckland's more windy Hauraki Gulf will create a dramatic backdrop
for an event and restore the America's Cup to the following it had
in the Dennis Conner/Australia wars of the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The rueful joke around the New York Yacht Club _ holder of the
Cup since 1851 _ was that the skipper who lost it to a foreigner
would have his head placed on the empty pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   So when Conner did lose the Cup on Sept. 26, 1983, capping a
contentious summer of treachery and intrigue (remember Keelgate?)
in fabulous Newport, sailing had a hit movie on its hands. This,
despite the fact that televised coverage then was little more than
a static, distant helicopter shot.
</P>
<P>
   But the storyline got even better when the revenge motive was
added. Three years after losing the Cup, Big Bad Dennis waged his
crusade to win it back in an exotic Indian Ocean land. Pictures of
white sand, blue water, and splashing boats flickered in the living
rooms of winter-weary America.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN, on location in its funky, trailer-stack of a village, was
a kid with a new toy. Cockpit cams, sail cams, real live
news-conference bickering, and all the hilarity of a sleepy, remote
fishing port turned into a worldwide party town came home on the
tube.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, race fans used to half-mile shots of the
boats climbed aboard with Big Bad Dennis and watched the action as
monster bodies whirled on the coffee grinder winches.
</P>
<P>
   But then . . . it was over. Conner brought the Cup home to San
Diego where, despite continued ESPN commitment and creativity, it
just didn't play. The legal hassle over the catamaran _ as Conner
ducked a sucker-punch challenge from New Zealand in a 130-foot
monohull _ wound up in court for years.
</P>
<P>
   By 1992, when the next real Cup was raced in San Diego, it was a
matchup between a couple of billionaires _ Bill Koch and Italy's
Raul Gardini. The American spent $60 million, the Italian $100
million, and the public was turned off, widely believing that the
America's Cup could simply be bought by any rich eccentric.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Koch made a strong bid to revitalize the Cup in
1995 by creating the first all-woman team. The move drew genuine
interest through the trial season, as did the upstart Young America
team with the mermaid boat.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the end, things went bad. Koch and Conner rehashed the
rules to their advantage, and Conner advanced to the finals _ using
Young America's faster boat. But the public perception (and who
could blame them) was that the America's Cup was a sport in which
fatcats made up the rules as they went along, an ancient echo of
past years when the New York Yacht Club was perennially accused of
rigging the rules to shut out the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Team New Zealand dominated the 1995 Cup, and the already
turned-off fans were underwhelmed by a very much expected 5-0
wipeout of the Americans by the Kiwi All-Blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, though New Zealand's Sir Peter Blake made an emotional
dedication to fairness and evenhandedness in decisions involving
New Zealand and the challengers, the first act was to rig a pocket
challenge that stretched the time between Cups to 4 1/2 years.
Whatever fans were still hanging in there through the San Diego
shuffle may simply have dried up during the long wait.
</P>
<P>
   Will the wind blow hard Monday in the Hauraki Gulf? It's
supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Cup have a story to tell? Among other things, New
Englanders can lay claim to one of the strongest challengers in the
prerace oddsmaking in the New York Yacht Club's Young America bid.
This is the first time a chance has developed for the Cup to return
to Newport.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN is investing 70 hours in a bet that the spectacle that
brought the network fame, if not fortune, 13 years ago in
Australia, will have enough story left to win back a following.

COMMUNITY REACHES OUT TO FAMILY OF SLAIN GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ When his daughter was abducted Tuesday, Paul
Butler felt every person on earth was evil. But after receiving
condolences, gifts and cards from more than a hundred well-wishers
Saturday, he felt differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of good people out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Butler was abducted near her home Tuesday and found dead
27 miles away Friday, in a wooded area behind a church in Grain
Valley, Mo. The 10-year-old fifth-grader will be buried Wednesday
in Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``She won't laugh; she won't play; she won't have a birthday;
she won't get to graduate from high school,'' one visitor, Florida
Burrell, said Saturday outside the Butler home. ``It's
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith D. Nelson, the 24-year-old Kansas City, Kan., man who is
charged with kidnapping Pamela, remained in fair condition Saturday
evening at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City,
Kan. Authorities had planned to move him to the Wyandotte County
Jail, but a fever kept him at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has been in the hospital since he was captured Thursday.
Doctors operated Friday on his left knee, which police believe he
injured while fleeing Wednesday. Authorities plan to take him
before a federal magistrate Monday, FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about 40 investigators continued collecting evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the investigation, nearly every agent at the FBI's
Kansas City office _ about 100 of them _ plus dozens of
investigators from Wyandotte County, Grain Valley, Kansas City,
Kan., and police recruits from Kansas City, Mo., lent a hand. It
has been an especially draining experience for them, Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the tender age of the victim, it's very troubling
emotionally to a lot of the investigators, even the ones who have
seen very bad things over the years,'' Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators had planned to search Saturday through the Grain
Valley woods where Pamela's body and clothes were found, but they
finished the search about 7 p.m. Friday because of the threat of
rain, which could have washed away evidence. They carried out more
items Friday evening but would not discuss them.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy Friday told investigators how Pamela died and whether
she had been sexually assaulted, but Lanza would not talk about the
autopsy results. The body was released to Pamela's family.
</P>
<P>
   One or two agents will use a private airplane to carry all the
evidence to Washington, where the FBI has equipment to examine it
more thoroughly, Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
   That evidence will be presented to a federal grand jury, which
can decide whether Nelson should face additional charges.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit supporting the federal kidnapping charge, a
next-door neighbor of Nancy Nelson's, the suspect's mother,
mentioned seeing someone who looked like Nelson and another man
coming out of Nancy Nelson's basement about four hours after Pamela
was kidnapped. She also said she heard two men arguing in the house
about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Lanza said investigators did not think a second
person helped in the abduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't anticipate that another person is going to be charged
right now, at least in regards to the kidnapping,'' Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
   At Pamela's home Saturday, a stream of people delivered cards,
money, food, hugs, handshakes and words of comfort. Several handed
over $20 bills. One girl gave a doll still in its store wrapper. A
man offered to fix the family's roof and make other home repairs.
Others provided sacks of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very sorry,'' Donna Yadrich of Kansas City, Kan., said
as she handed Paul Butler helium-filled balloons and a black
marking pen. ``That's for Pamela. Write messages on those, and you
can send them to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Yadrich's 4-year-old daughter, Audrey, had followed the events
on television but did not understand that Pamela never would come
home.
</P>
<P>
   She looked at the front door and asked: ``Where's Pamela?''
</P>
<P>
   Her mom stroked her daughter's hair and did not answer.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela's mother, Cherri West, missed many of the visitors while
making funeral arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The family received multiple offers for free burial services.
</P>
<P>
   West accepted a casket from Joseph A. Butler's Sons Chapel in
Kansas City, Kan. Chapel Hill Memorial Gardens donated burial
services, Kansas City Wilbert Vault Co. gave the burial vault, and
Don Evans Florist is providing free flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela's living room has become a shrine. Dozens and dozens of
flowers surround a framed school photo of a smiling Pamela that was
taken last year. An upstairs bedroom is packed with stuffed
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors said little about the man accused of abducting Pamela.
But in one quiet moment, Butler summed up everyone's mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole family is pressing for the death penalty,'' he said.
``If we get up a petition, everybody who has come to this house
would sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonya McManus of Leavenworth, who took a stuffed puppy to Grain
Valley Christian Church on Saturday morning, later in the day gave
Butler a single rose.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she visited both places, McManus paused. Her chin
quivered. ``I have a daughter of my own, almost 6,'' she explained.

Three-touchdown blitz lifts Texas A&AMP;M
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
COLLEGE STATION _ With less than two minutes left in the first half
Saturday, Texas A&AMP;M was in trouble. Deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 10-3 to Kansas, a 31-point underdog, the Aggies were
forced to punt from deep in their own territory. All-American Shane
Lechler hit a weak kick, booting the ball a mere 17 yards to the
A&AMP;M 34-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   But in the time it takes to throw a penalty flag, things
changed. Referee Terry Turlington ruled Lechler had been roughed by
KU's Matt Jordan. It was a questionable call at best, but it
started the Aggies on their way to a 34-17 win.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty began an offensive onslaught by the Aggies, who
scored 21 points in less than two minutes at the end of the first
half and the start of the second half. Texas A&AMP;M (5-1, 1-1 Big 12)
wound up with 522 yards of offense, but the bulk of its scoring
came on the heels of the roughing penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could tell the momentum was shifting in our favor after
that penalty,'' said A&AMP;M quarterback Randy McCown, who passed for a
career-best 362 yards. ``When you sense that, you want to take
advantage of it, get every last bit of what you can.''
</P>
<P>
   After the penalty, McCown hit Chris Taylor for 41 yards to set
up a 15-yard touchdown pass to Leroy Hodge with 52 seconds left
before halftime. That tied the score at 10, and the Aggies weren't
finished.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas' Mitch Bowles fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and A&AMP;M's
Jason Webster recovered at the Jayhawks' 37-yard line. After two
completions, McCown ran 15 yards for another touchdown, putting the
Aggies ahead 17-10 with 23 seconds left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   On the second play of the second half, McCown found Taylor alone
at midfield and hit him with a perfect pass. Taylor raced untouched
into the end zone for a 78-yard touchdown, putting the Aggies in
command 24-10 and demoralizing the Jayhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they scored 14 points right before the half, that was
tough,'' said Kansas linebacker Andrew Leclair. ``We tried to keep
our heads up. But it's tough to beat a team like A&AMP;M when we make
those kinds of mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Was the call by Turlington a mistake? A case can be made the
referee was in error. TV replays indicated Texas A&AMP;M's Amon Simon,
not Jordan, actually plowed into Lechler. Jordan appeared to have
just missed blocking the punt, and his impetus knocked Simon into
Lechler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a low snap, and I could tell there was going to be
pressure,'' said Lechler. ``He (Jordan) came down and hit my right
leg. It was a huge penalty for us. That can make or break a team
sometimes, but we got the call on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   A 15-yard penalty for roughing the punter _ not a five-yard call
for running into the punter _ allowed the Aggies to maintain
possession and start their 21-point barrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pivotal play,'' said Kansas coach Terry Allen. ``It
was disappointing. I really can't talk about it. That's just the
way it goes sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Turlington was asked to explain his call after the game. His
explanation added only more confusion to the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw was a shank off the punter's foot, and the player
was blocked into the punter,'' said Turlington. ``I called roughing
the punter.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the interpretation, the Aggies took advantage of it.
McCown, who was 14-of-16 for 186 yards in the first half, moved the
ball 68 yards in four plays for the tying touchdown. After the
fumble on the kickoff, McCown needed only four plays and 22 seconds
for another score.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (the penalty) was a big play because it gave us another
set of downs,'' said Aggies coach R.C. Slocum. ``But we had to do
something with the opportunity, and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   McCown spent the afternoon taking advantage of a porous Kansas
pass defense. His 78-yard bomb to Taylor 58 seconds into the second
half was one reason McCown was able to amass the third-best passing
day by an Aggies quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to establish the long ball, because that's what they
were giving us,'' said McCown, who was passed for more than 1,500
yards in six games this season. ``We knew our guys were faster than
their guys, and we were able to go deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Of McCown's career-best 21 completions, 11 were for more than 10
yards, including bombs of 37, 41, 44 and 78 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew if we could get a feel for the game, our momentum
would carry us into the end zone,'' he said. ``We didn't get
flustered. We stayed relaxed.''

LEWIS GIVES HEADS-UP ON HOLYFIELD TACTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lennox Lewis agrees with Mike Tyson. The World Boxing Council
heavyweight champion believes Evander Holyfield is a bit too heady.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize he had such a good noggin,'' Lewis said last
week from his training camp in the Poconos, where he is preparing
for a Nov. 13 rematch of his controversial draw with Holyfield last
March. ``When he comes into me, he has his head down and he's
trying to butt me. We're working on a defense for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only concern with him is the head-butting. I'm not known as
a dirty fighter. I don't butt or throw elbows. Or bite anyone.
Against Tyson, I said maybe (Holyfield's) not a butter, but having
been in there (with him), he definitely practices that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a ring around his heavy bag (where his forehead hits
it). Why? He practices that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's charge echoes that of Tyson, who claimed that Holyfield
butted him in both of their matches. Those actions _ and the
referee's inaction _ led Tyson to twice bite Holyfield in the ears
during their rematch. That resulted in Tyson's disqualification, a
suspension of more than a year, and the growth of his reputation
for uncontrolled violence.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield denied all wrongdoing at the time, and a close review
of the tapes seemed to show that it was Tyson leading with his
head, not Holyfield. But now Lewis has leveled the same charge at
the three-time heavyweight champion after having been cut twice
from what he claims were head butts in their confrontation at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Does Lewis expect more of the same Nov. 13?
</P>
<P>
   ``His only positive attack was with his head,'' Lewis said. ``If
that's all he's got, he doesn't have enough for Lennox Lewis. He
still doesn't have a game plan for Lennox Lewis. This fight is
going to lead him into retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not, but according to Tyson and now Lewis, Holyfield's
still the head man.
</P>
<P>
   Short jabs
</P>
<P>
   Lewis must have picked up some extra pants, because he recently
accepted the International Boxing Organization heavyweight title
belt. What other reason does he have for wanting that belt? . . .
Holyfield seems to have sensed that he needs to make changes in his
approach if he is to defeat Lewis, and he is not missing any
details. For years, he has risen to train at 5:30 a.m., often at
the House of Pain gym in Houston. But for this fight he is not
beginning his day until his 11 a.m. weight training session, and is
doing his boxing from 9-11 p.m. Holyfield claims he wants to spar
around the same time of day that he will be fighting . . . Young
Floyd Mayweather appears to have overplayed his hand and cost
himself $12.5 million. Mayweather was offered a six-fight,
three-year contract from Home Box Office that would have paid him
an average of $2 million a fight and doubled his previous high of
$500,000 if he agreed to make a short-notice appearance Nov. 6 vs.
Smoke Gainer. Mayweather not only refused, he called the offer ``a
slave contract,'' thereby angering even his father, Floyd Sr., who
also trains him. That Mayweather is highly skilled is obvious. That
he is untested in the marketplace of public opinion is just as
obvious. Yet somehow he has concluded that he is already in the
same ticket-selling league with Oscar De La Hoya, his stablemate
under the promotional umbrella of Bob Arum. To compare the two as
drawing cards is like comparing the ace of hearts to the two of
clubs. HBO senior vice president for programming Lou DiBella says
the network will not distribute a planned Dec. 10 pay-per-view
fight, which forced Arum to cancel it. Now it appears Mayweather
may not fight again until late April, and then only because HBO
must give him the final fight of their present contract by then
(for $750,000). HBO also has first and last refusal rights on any
of his fights in 2000, even though their contract is up after his
next fight unless he can convince HBO to put their deal back on the
table. ``I like Floyd and respect his talent, but he's a misguided
young man,'' DiBella said from New York. ``I found his comments
insulting not only to Top Rank (Arum's company) and HBO but also to
99.9 percent of the fighters who would give anything for the
opportunity he's thumbing his nose at. He has a very inflated
opinion of his worth.'' Not in a few months he won't . . . Orlin
Norris got a surprise when he learned from a reporter that his Oct.
23 fight with Tyson had been cut from 12 rounds to 10. ``You'd
think they would give us the common courtesy of notifying us,''
said an angry Scott Woodwirth, Norris's manager. ``Orlin is being
treated like a preliminary guy.'' Wise guys in Las Vegas have Tyson
a 12-1 favorite, but Norris said, ``I'm confident in my ability.
There's really no need for me to be afraid or intimidated. I've
wanted this fight for a long time. I know what I'm facing. I know
what's in front of me. It's not a mystery.'' . . . To beef up the
Tyson-Norris card, International Boxing Federation junior
lightweight champion Roberto Garcia and two-time champion Luisito
Espinosa have been added to the show at the MGM Grand. Garcia will
defend his title for the third time against undefeated Diego
Corrales (28-0, 23 KOs) while Espinosa (44-8, 23 KOs) puts his No.
1 ranking on the line against young Las Vegas prospect Augie
Sanchez (22-1, 19 KOs) . . . British middleweight Adrian Dodson
ripped a page from Tyson's book when he was disqualified Tuesday
night for biting his opponent during a fight for the Commonwealth
middleweight title. Dodson was well ahead entering the final round
when he suddenly bit Canadian Alain Bonamie in the side. Said
Spencer Oliver, Dodson's trainer, ``Adrian was worn out at the end
but I still don't understand why he bit him.'' . . . British
promoter Jonathan Field claims to be in negotiations with the
handlers of Laila Ali to match the 21-year-old daughter of Muhammad
Ali against one of England's top female fighters in February. Jane
Couch won the first woman's professional fight in Great Britain
last year. The last time an Ali fought in England, Laila's father
stopped Brian London in three rounds in 1966 . . . Former New
Jersey Athletic Control board member Gary Shaw has been hired to
run Main Events for Kathy Duva, the widow of promoter Dan Duva who
bought out the Duva clan and took over the company her husband
founded. Shaw has been a member of the New Jersey Athletic
Commission since 1971. Dino and Donna Duva and their father, Lou,
have yet to decide whether they will form their own promotional
company, but Lou and partner Shelly Finkel will continue to work
with Shaw and Main Events for now.
</P>
<P>
   Around and around
</P>
<P>
   You can expect IBF middleweight champion Bernard Hopkins to sign
a three-fight deal with HBO possibly as early as this week and then
abdicate his throne to move down to 154 pounds in pursuit of cash
and another world title. Hopkins is set to fight Antwun Echols Dec.
4 underneath the Fernando Vargas-Winky Wright bout on HBO and word
is the 35-year-old champion is also ready to relinquish the
middleweight title to campaign at 154 pounds in pursuit of both
Vargas and World Boxing Association champion David Reid if HBO
agrees to guarantee him a three-fight deal that will bring him the
biggest purses of his career. Hopkins reportedly would have no
trouble making 154 pounds even though he has fought as a
middleweight since his pro debut in 1988 . . . Somebody needs to
tell the monarch of Buganda to get up a little earlier in the
morning. Despite the fact that the Lewis-Holyfield fight is set for
the Thomas and Mack Center Nov. 13 and sold out, Ronald Muwenda
Mutebi II, the monarch of Buganda (a kingdom in Uganda), offered to
pay $15 million to bring the fight to Kampala, the capital of the
East African nation. With the fight only four weeks away, not even
promoter Don King could find a way to opt out of Las Vegas for
bigger money in Africa. ``He missed the boat,'' said Panos Eliades,
Lewis's British promoter. ``He should get his order in beforehand.
The tickets have all been sold and he wants to make a deal?'' . . .
Speaking of Reid, his promoter, Dan Goossen, is also in a dispute
with HBO that could result in Reid moving over to Showtime next
year. HBO rejected two proposed opponents for a December fight in
which Reid would have fought on a double bill with Vargas to
increase interest in a planned summer 2000 showdown between the
two. But Goossen no longer has an interest in that as long as he
believes he can get Reid in with De La Hoya for bigger money. Hence
the rift . . . With Gainer-Mayweather dead, Nov. 6 now will be
filled with a heavyweight doubleheader matching Hasim Rahman vs.
Zeljko Mavrovich and Mount Whitaker vs. undefeated Derrick
Jefferson . . . WBC-WBO featherweight champion Naseem Hamed was
watching the De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad fight with trainer Emanuel
Steward at their training camp in the Poconos, where Hamed is
preparing for a unification fight Oct. 22 in Detroit with WBC
champion Cesar Soto, but he quickly lost interest. ``He told me,
`If we didn't know who these two boys were we would have shut this
off by now and gone off and played pool,' '' Steward said . . . HBO
will show the Hamed-Soto featherweight unification title fight Oct.
22 at 8 p.m. in an attempt to increase the audience among young
viewers. Junior featherweight champion Erik Morales (33-0, 27 KOs)
defends his title vs. former bantamweight titleholder Wayne
McCullough (23-2, 14 KOs) on the undercard . . . Lewis said of
Holyfield, ``He lives in a fallacy, not reality. He's not the Real
Deal any more. The only way I can lose this fight is if I stick my
chin out and say go hit it.'' King would like to match Trinidad
against WBA champion James Page but he admits that the WBC's No. 1
contender, Derrell Coley, ``has a legitimate case,'' to force a
fight with Trinidad. Coley has been waiting nearly two years for
his shot, and last week the WBC ordered the fight be held before
Trinidad faces anyone else. But will that mean the WBC might strip
Trinidad if he skips over Coley for a rematch with De La Hoya?
``Are you crazy?'' asked Arum, De La Hoya's promoter. ``They're not
going to pass up that sanction fee.'' . . . Roy Jones will be the
headliner in the first HBO fight of the new millennium if he
appears as scheduled Jan. 15, probably against Michael Nunn . . .
Razor Ruddock is now 8-0 in his latest comeback, and his crushing
first-round KO of journeyman Jose Ribalta boosts his stock a bit
more as promoter Mike Acri continues to try and pick a path to a
big-money fight for the 35-year-old Ruddock. ``We'd love to fight
Grant, Andrew Golota, or Wladimir Klitschko,'' Acri said. Acri
hopes to reunite Ruddock with top trainer Jess who split
with Ruddock recently . . . Legendary boxing writer Bert Sugar
reports he's not too happy about his new neighbors _ Bill and
Hillary Clinton. They will move in next door to Sugar's home in
Chappaqua, N.Y. ``I voted to send him to Washington, not to
Chappaqua,'' Sugar said . . . Some guys never learn. Larry Holmes
makes his second Legends of Boxing appearance Oct. 29 in Puerto
Rico vs. Mike Sedillo, with Hector Camacho the Elder squaring off
against Jorge Vaca. Why?

Pit road accident injures 12
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FORT WORTH _ A bizarre pit road crash caused 12 people to suffer
injuries Saturday at Texas Motor Speedway during the final practice
session for today's Mall.com 500 Indy Racing League event.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henry Bock, the medical director for the IRL, said none of
the injuries were life-threatening, but some of the injured were
transported by helicopter and ambulance to Fort Worth-area
hospitals. The names of the injured individuals were not
immediately released by IRL officials.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened when Swedish driver Niclas Jonsson, a
rookie whose first IRL race was three weeks ago in Las Vegas, lost
control of his car while exiting the pit lane near the end of the
practice session.
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson's car suddenly jerked to the left and slammed into the
car of Tyce Carlson, which was being worked on in the pit stall.
Members of Carlson's pit crew never had a chance to avoid Jonsson's
car. Men around Carlson's car and several people inside the pit
wall were injured. Neither driver was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no screeching at all _ just bam!'' said Jeff Ross, a
witness.
</P>
<P>
   The reason why Jonsson's car would take such a violent turn to
the left as he was leaving the pits was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am willing to bet money (Jonsson) pushed the wrong button
and deactivated (the car),'' said veteran driver Eddie Cheever, who
was standing three pit stalls away from the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson, 32, was the 27th and slowest qualifier for the race.
His team does not have a backup car and is not expected to compete
in today's race. Carlson does have a backup car, but the team has
not determined whether they will compete today because of the
injuries to crew members.

CRIMSON BARELY BEAT FORDHAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After two weeks of finding ways to squander
opportunities to win, Harvard employed a time-tested method of
conserving a lead in holding off Fordham, 37-30, Saturday in a
nonleague game.
</P>
<P>
   The Crimson took a 34-3 halftime advantage before Fordham (0-6)
rallied. But the purposeful running of Chris Menick on Harvard's
final possession consumed enough time for the Crimson to regain
their composure and preserve the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the last series I told the kids, `They know we are going to
run, and we are going to have to hammer out a couple of first
downs,' '' Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. ``I was disappointed we
didn't get another first down, but it was a good effort by our
offensive line on the last series.''
</P>
<P>
   Fordham pulled within 7 points on a 32-yard field goal by Brian
Colsant with 4:05 remaining. Then, Harvard went to Menick, who
gained 7, 2, and 7 yards before Fordham gained possession. The Rams
quickly moved to midfield before Ben Green intercepted a Mike
Georgia pass on the final significant play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our best first half and worst second half of the
season,'' Murphy said. ``But when you are up, 34-3, you can say
whatever you want, but you don't have the same mind-set. That's not
an excuse; it's a fact of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, they were playing us to run, the same as
in the first half, when we threw the ball up and down the field. We
were in the situation of still having to throw even though we were
up 30 points.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard (3-2) had lost to Colgate and Cornell by a total of 4
points in the last two weeks, and Fordham was coming off its
smallest losing margin of the season, a 35-18 setback to
Pennsylvania, the Crimson's opponent next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But after a dominating start, complacency set in for Harvard. In
the first half, Brad Wilford ran for a 19-yard touchdown and threw
touchdown passes of 21 yards to Andy Fried and 5 yards to Terence
Patterson. Patterson returned a punt 55 yards for a score, and
Menick ran 4 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Fordham retaliated behind Georgia, who passed for 382 yards but
was stymied by interceptions by Clint Kollar and Ben Green.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' final possession began at the 21-yard line with 58
seconds remaining. Georgia completed passes of 14, 19, and 5 yards.
But two plays later, Green intercepted at the 17-yard line and
returned to the 47 with six seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we were still good enough to run the ball in the second
half,'' Menick said. ``They were clogging up holes pretty good,
though. They played good defense and stiffened up.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the last possession, I just said to myself to run hard and
get as many yards as I can, take guys on and drive them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Menick gained 139 yards on 26 carries, increasing his career
total to 2,872 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows what we are capable of,'' Murphy said. ``But we
just have to make sure the Harvard of the first half shows up next
week and not the Harvard of the second half.''

CHAMPIONING THE CAUSE OF THE MIDWEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The West may be the best, as the late, lamented Jim Morrison
once cried. But the Midwest has been the best lately, producing the
last two non-Chicago champions (Houston, San Antonio) as well as
five of the last six Western Conference champions.
</P>
<P>
   The division also has the best player in the game in Tim Duncan,
who, scarily, is still getting better. That frightening development
means that the Spurs will be favored not only to win the division
again, but also to repeat as NBA champions.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Spurs stay in San Antonio, or Duncan stays with
them, may well be decided in 16 days when voters decide whether to
raise some tourist taxes to build an arena. (Houston has a similar
referendum.) The Spurs can't stay where they are and may have to
look elsewhere if the voters say no. Duncan, who will be a free
agent next summer, is keeping his options open, prompting at least
two teams (Orlando, Chicago) to blow up their rosters in the faint
hope that they can lure him.
</P>
<P>
   But that's for next summer's reading. Today, we present the
Midwest Division as the second-strongest in the NBA (slightly
behind the Pacific), with the best player and the best team. The
division also has two oldies but goodies in Utah and Houston, each
gearing up for a chance at (in the cases of Utah and Charles
Barkley) that elusive first title.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz lost Shandon Anderson, which isn't quite as calamitous
as it's being made out to be. Yes, he was a nice sub. But he didn't
play all that well last year and is hardly irreplaceable. The Jazz
signed Olden Polynice, an upgrade over Greg Ostertag in every
category except ``what qualifies as certifiable behavior?'' They
will still rely on their Hall of Famers to get them to the title
and, barring injuries, should be in the hunt again.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is a little harder to figure. The Rockets will have a
new backcourt in Steve Francis and Anderson, and may have more
depth thanks to the Portland package left on their doorstep for
Scottie Pippen. But that's a lot of new guys for a team that,
ultimately, will live or die with its actuarial wonders, Hakeem
Olajuwon and Barkley. This may indeed be the Chuckster's last call,
although we've suggested that before.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota could be very interesting, but still looks to be a
player short. Plus, Joe Smith is out for a while, and he was an
effective counter to Kevin Garnett. And can Terrell Brandon stay
healthy?
</P>
<P>
   Denver is a chic pick by some _ we kid you not _ to be the
conference dark horse. Black sheep is more appropriate. The Nuggets
have no size and a lot of uncertainty about the roster. Dallas will
continue to stink and Vancouver will remain a nice place to visit,
especially if you've got the Grizzlies on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a preview of the division, with the teams listed in
projected order of finish.
</P>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO SPURS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Last season: 37-13, tied for first place. Won the NBA
championship.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Terry Porter, Samaki Walker, Chucky Brown,
Felton Spencer, new arena (?).
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Will Perdue, new arena (?).
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key ``maybe'': Sean Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Hallelujah Chorus.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: The Spurs are the epitome of a 1990s champion:
They have a really, really good player (Duncan), a really good
accomplice (David Robinson), and a lot of average Joes who know
their roles and play them. That's how the Bulls won. That's how the
Rockets won. That's all you need now, and the Spurs have it. Of
course, they also have a gimpy Robinson, who, lest we forget, is
34. But if he stays healthy and continues to defer to Duncan, which
he now understands is the right thing to do, the Spurs should be
OK. The status of Elliott (kidney transplant) is a potential
problem; most figure he'll retire with his ring and his health, and
who could blame him? He already has lined up a broadcast gig for
the season. The additions of Brown and Walker will help up front;
Walker may be a real steal because he's now with a real NBA team,
not the Mavericks. The gentle Spencer replaces Perdue, who didn't
do much anyway. If the big guys stay healthy and on top of their
game, who's to bet against them going for No. 2?
</P>
<P>
   UTAH JAZZ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Last season: 37-13, tied for first place. Lost to Portland
in the second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Shandon Anderson, Greg Foster, GM Scott Layden.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Quincy Lewis, Olden Polynice, Pete Chilcutt.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Something In The Way.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: Dis these guys at your own peril. They'll still be
around in the end, but you have to wonder whether there's an
extraterrestrial force working against them. They are finally rid
of Michael Jordan, and now they have to deal with Duncan. Even
Layden got fed up and left for New York, of all places, where he
ran smack into Knicks 101, with Patrick Ewing not playing and
Latrell Sprewell not showing. Even Karl Malone's annual diatribes
pale in comparison. Malone and John Stockton will continue to be
the main men; what we don't know is whether Utah's playoff
blemishes were real or lockout-inspired. The Jazz should have lost
to the Kings and did lose to Portland, who out-everythinged them.
Anderson's loss is tough, but Lewis, a promising rookie, may be
able to take his spot. By season's end, he also may be taking
creaky Jeff Hornacek's position. The Jazz supposedly have been on
their last roundup for years. There's still horses here for
another.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON ROCKETS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Last season: 31-19, third place. Lost to the Lakers in the
first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Steve Francis, Kelvin Cato, Walt Williams,
Shandon Anderson, Tony Massenburg.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Scottie Pippen, Othella Harrington, Brent
Price, Antoine Carr, Michael Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Reclaim My Place.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: Well, the Pippen Plan really worked, eh? Now, the
Rockets have reloaded and rebuilt and, well, they've got a lot of
new people trying to prop up Hakeem and Charles for another title
run. On paper, they probably deserve better. Williams is a
sharpshooter who is a perfect outside complement to Olajuwon and
Barkley. Cato is a shot-blocker supreme who got lost in Portland's
depth chart. Anderson and Francis will likely be the starting
backcourt. But that's a lot of new bodies playing key roles, and a
couple weeks of training camp isn't going to be enough out of the
box. Plus, you have Chuck and Hakeem getting on, as they say. This
is Barkley's fourth year in Houston and it could well be his last _
anywhere. If Rudy T can get these guys to buy into his ``Heart of a
Champion'' stuff, he may have something by the spring. However,
Francis is a potential loose cannon _ ``You never know when he'll
go JUCO on you,'' said one scout _ and Anderson is not a prototype
shooting guard.

   MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Last season: 25-25, fourth place. Lost to San Antonio in
the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Wally Szczerbiak, William Avery, Radoslav
Nesterovic.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: None.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: Kevin McHale has weathered a couple of prominent
defections and lived to tell about it. Now, he has his two top
players, Kevin Garnett and Terrell Brandon, under wraps well into
the next century, and it's time. Garnett has a chance to be a
franchise player; he's already an All-Star. He's also scary in that
he knows who he is and what he needs to do. The Wolves, remember,
were the only Western Conference team to win a game against the
Spurs in the playoffs last year. They may start slow, with Joe
Smith on the sidelines, but they could be a real intriguing group
come spring. Szczerbiak has wowed his bosses, which means he must
be playing a lot better than he did at the Tournament of the
Americas in Puerto Rico. But is he quick enough to defend the
shooting guards and small forwards? Avery is an excellent addition
as Brandon's backup, and Nesterovic, who had a demitasse of coffee
at the end of the season, is backing up veteran Dean Garrett. They
also lost no one of consequence over the summer, but they deserved
a break after the Tom Gugliotta and Stephon Marbury departures.
</P>
<P>
   DENVER NUGGETS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Last year: 14-36, sixth place. Did not qualify for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Ron Mercer, Popeye Jones, James Posey,
George McCloud, Chris Herren.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Danny Fortson, Eric Williams, Eric Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Quicksand.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: There's a bit of a dropoff between No. 4 and No.
5. These guys aren't going to overpower anybody, but they have
firepower at almost every position. The big question: Can new
boss/old boss Dan Issel put it together even though Mercer and
Chauncey Billups are both free-agents-to-be? He brought in George
McCloud for extra zap and locker room smarts. The return of Raef
LaFrentz is huge; he was playing very well before he went down last
season. The team likes newcomer Posey and there's always the
possibility that Jones will rebound the way he once did. But the
linchpins are the same as last year: Antonio McDyess and Nick Van
Exel. Issel overpaid Van Exel by about $30 million and Nick the
Quick remains someone who's good enough to get you beat. Yet the
Lakers miss his toughness and his willingness to take the big shot.
If he can keep his head on straight, this team has a chance to make
a decent jump. Keeping the ex-Celtics happy may be an entirely
different matter.
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS MAVERICKS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Last season: 19-31, fifth place. Did not qualify for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: None.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Chris Anstey, A.C. Green.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Heavy Sedation.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: We neglected, by choice, not to include Sean Rooks
as a key addition because he's just an addition _ we think. There
also was no help in the draft, so we have a 19-31 team coming back
basically intact. The Mavs should be better. They may even be
better. Michael Finley, Gary Trent, and Steve Nash are more than
adequate starters. Cedric Ceballos came back. Swizzle stick Shawn
Bradley still has about 29 years left on his contract and, as we
know, coach/general manager Don Nelson is infatuated with big men
because the only ones he had in his previous coaching stints were
people like Paul Mokeski, Randy Breuer, an over-the-hill Bob
Lanier, and Manute Bol. People in Boston will be keeping an eye on
Dirk Nowitzki, to see if he blossoms as Rick Pitino (and a lot of
others) thinks he will. A full training camp won't hurt. The Mavs
haven't made the playoffs since 1990. That's unlikely to change.
But they are retiring Rolando Blackman's uniform.
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER GRIZZLIES &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Last season: 8-42, seventh place. Did not qualify for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Michael Dickerson, Othella Harrington, Brent
Price, Antoine Carr, Dennis Scott, Grant Long.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Steve Francis, Tony Massenburg.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Meet Me in St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: Let's face it: the Grizzlies never recovered from
their triple-overtime loss to the Celtics early last season. Or
from Bryant Reeves showing up at camp at about 600 pounds. Live and
learn, as they say. The Grizzlies have to be better than last year
_ they ended up with the worst record in the 50-game mini-season _
and may even be good enough to get out of the basement. Dickerson
is a nice addition at shooting guard, but they still need more
oomph up front, something they desperately tried to get on draft
day. As of now, Harrington and Long are the power forwards and it's
going to be hard to go to battle every night in a conference with a
lot of strong, smart, and good power forwards. Mike Bibby has a
year under his belt and Shareef Abdur-Rahim would be a household
name almost anywhere else. The big question hovering over the
franchise is whether it'll move to St. Louis in a couple years.
Another subpar season in GM Place would seem to ensure that.

Bold NFL expansion bid enhances Patterson's rise
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when the Rockets were in their infantile stages and
Steve Patterson was a wet-behind-the-ears middle schooler, kids
asked Young Steve what his father did for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``He runs the Houston Rockets,'' he would say. ``And they'd tell
me,'' Patterson says now, laughing, ```You mean he works for
NASA?'''
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, people would learn what Patterson's father did for
a living. From the struggling days in the early 1970s when the NBA
was an afterthought until the league enjoyed a wildly successful
growth spurt through the 1980s, Ray Patterson pushed the buttons as
Rockets general manager.
</P>
<P>
   And often, close to Ray Patterson's side was Young Steve. It has
been a blessing and a curse for Steve Patterson's executive career
to be so closely associated with his father's. He often sailed
along for the ride with his father, as the Rockets and the NBA
began to take off. He served as a Rockets summer intern, then an
assistant and then, fresh after earning a law degree from the
University of Texas, as counselor to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Never did he feel as if he didn't belong, or that he couldn't
handle the load, but others wondered. Never did he feel as if he
was in over his head, even if there were some who believed
Patterson was too young, too brash and too lucky to be in such a
powerful role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always realized I'm a lucky guy,'' Patterson said. ``But
that doesn't mean you don't work hard and have plenty of sleepless
nights thinking about getting things done. I don't worry about what
someone might say.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ray Patterson became club president in 1989 before retiring
a year later, some also said then-Rockets owner Charlie Thomas made
Steve Patterson the youngest general manager in the NBA at 32 only
because his longtime friend, Ray, requested it.
</P>
<P>
   But Young Steve pressed on, even as his talents and credentials
were questioned. There were sleepless nights, but not over what his
critics said.
</P>
<P>
   The perception was that it all was handed to him; that he rode
his father's coattails all the way to the front office and was
qualified to become Rockets general manager only because of his
last name.
</P>
<P>
   He often responded as he often answers critics now, curling his
bottom lip, raising an eyebrow and giving a look that says, ``Just
wait.'' He would pause, stare off into the distance and measure his
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are those that felt that way,'' he says. ``But I
felt I was fortunate to work with my father and learn a number of
things from him. Everybody needs a mentor. We worked well
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The wait is over. Today, Patterson is dancing among the most
recognizable front-office names in sports and he got there not
because of his last name but his confident determination.
</P>
<P>
   An NFL franchise is on its way to Houston and it is arriving in
no small part because Steve Patterson spent 2{ years grinding out
the details, negotiating the successful stadium effort, carrying
the bid over numerous political hurdles and refusing to waver under
the constant threat of the unorganized Los Angeles bid stealing
away the NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   When the NFL expansion franchise seemed to be slipping away last
spring, as owners conditionally awarded the franchise to Los
Angeles, Patterson stood outside commissioner Paul Tagliabue's news
conference and all but sneered when asked about Houston's hopes
being seemingly dashed. He raised an eyebrow and offered that look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's LA's time to put up or shut up,'' he said. ``We'll see if
they can pull it off now.''
</P>
<P>
   LA had to shut up. Clearly, Bob McNair with his cool
determination and $700 million was the biggest reason the NFL chose
Houston for its 32nd franchise. But perhaps never has there been a
better time to re-evaluate what this still young (at 42), still
determined and still often brash executive has become.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful professional sports executive in this city's
history? Probably. He has helped build two of the most successful
franchises in this city and now helped McNair join the most
exclusive ownership fraternity in sports.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the perception was when he took over the Rockets'
front office, Patterson helped build an NBA champion, refusing to
buckle as his every move was dissected. He took part in
often-criticized draft decisions and negotiated every contract for
the 1994 NBA champion Rockets, including those of coach Rudy
Tomjanovich and free-agent signees Mario Elie and Matt Bullard.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson also was at the helm when the Rockets drafted
Georgia's Alec Kessler instead of the popular Texas-ex Travis Mays
in 1990, refusing to crater under public pressure to draft Mays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some folks around town and the organization that were
big UT fans,'' Patterson said. ``They were aghast when we passed on
Mays.''
</P>
<P>
   After drafting Kessler, Patterson traded him for the rights to
Carl Herrera, who was a part of the 1994 championship run.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson again was criticized in 1992 when he drafted Alabama's
Robert Horry instead of the athletic Harold Miner out of USC, but
that, too, proved to be a smart move.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Mays, we didn't think he could play,'' Patterson said.
``And that proved to be the case. With Miner, we didn't think he
could play, either. And that was the case, too. We didn't make
willy-nilly decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson also negotiated trades for Kenny Smith, Vernon Maxwell
and Otis Thorpe, which brought the Rockets the final parts to their
1994 championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter was we had a plan and we stuck to it,''
Patterson said. ``Through times when we had problems, we stayed
with it. We thought we could get there in five years and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the fifth year after Patterson was named Rockets
general manager was that he no longer was general manager. When
Leslie Alexander bought the franchise in 1993, Patterson's close
association with the former regime and his strong personality
clashed with the new owner.
</P>
<P>
   After Alexander announced upon purchasing the team that he would
be a ``very, very, very hands-on owner,'' Patterson confided to
friends he knew his days with the franchise were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   After the expected falling-out with Alexander, Patterson watched
the Rockets' title run from a distance before joining Chuck Watson
in the long-shot effort to make minor-league hockey a success in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment in time it wasn't any fun watching the Rockets
and not being there,'' Patterson said. ``But it was the best thing
that ever happened to me because I had a chance to work with Chuck
Watson _ a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   It also separated Patterson from his father's shadow. The break
with the Rockets might have been painful, but it led to his
eventually joining McNair.
</P>
<P>
   With Patterson running the business, the Aeros became one of the
best-marketed and most successful International Hockey League
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson again set forth a five-year plan for the Aeros to win
the IHL title, and they did in 1999. But again, Patterson was not
there for the title season, this time because Watson had
recommended McNair hire him to join the NFL expansion effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``People might not have thought we had a chance of getting the
team, but I thought we had a fair chance,'' McNair said. ``I didn't
really know Steve, but Chuck recommended him to me and he made him
available. With Steve, there was an immediate feeling of, `Let's go
after this. We can do it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I developed a lot of confidence in Steve because I could see
how he handled himself and reacted well under pressure. He was a
good thinker on his feet. He had what we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, McNair and Patterson overcame the longest of odds on
the way to building the successful NFL bid for Houston. And the key
to it all was putting together an often touchy campaign to finance
a retractable-roof stadium, which proved to be the biggest chip on
Houston's side in getting the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL dream was going to have a chance, McNair and
Patterson had to get the stadium by joining together political
factions that often pulled in opposite directions. Yet the Harris
County-Houston Sports Authority, the Houston Livestock Show and
Rodeo, Metro and Harris County officials came together. Then,
Patterson and McNair had to sell the public on the deal. Somehow it
all came together.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had so many different parties with disparate interests,''
Patterson said. ``We had to try and get them to coalesce around one
vision. That was difficult. There were a lot of nights when we went
home not knowing if we ever were going to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people were willing to do something for someone like Bob,
someone who lives in the community and has chaired all the
charitable organizations, is honest, is a great person and has a
good reputation. It worked.''
</P>
<P>
   But McNair and Patterson only thought the hard part was over
when they had the stadium deal in hand. There still were 31 NFL
owners to win over.
</P>
<P>
   As much as NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue had a good
relationship with McNair, the league owners couldn't care less.
Houston was nice. But the owners wanted LA.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of doubting Thomases,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   There also were doubting Adamses, Davises and Modells. The
league not only tested McNair's and Patterson's mettle during
negotiations, but used it as a negotiating chip with LA. The NFL
wanted to do everything it could to make LA the choice for
expansion and make Houston a first runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to prove ourselves to the owners, and the community had
to prove itself to them,'' Patterson said. ``I had a decades-long
relationship with the NBA, but we had to start from scratch with
the NFL. There were a number of owners that felt that we might not
have understood the value of an NFL team.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Patterson and McNair huddled and hustled in
their lobbying, trying to formulate a plan too good for the NFL to
pass up. Perhaps the final stroke of brilliance came after the
NFL's Sept. 15 deadline for an expansion decision had passed and
none was made.
</P>
<P>
   A consultant to McNair and Patterson, Phillip Burguieres,
offered to come up with a letter of credit that would be good for
only a 48-hour time frame. McNair and Patterson took the letter to
the NFL meetings in Atlanta and said take it or leave it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them, this is a deal that's good right now,''
Patterson said. ``It's good for everyone, but it's good for 48
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL took the deal and even granted McNair and Patterson
their request to host a Super Bowl at the earliest possible date,
which should only make the deal more profitable for Houston. The
city rejoiced.
</P>
<P>
   McNair became a hero. And Patterson, who will direct business
operations for the new franchise, might have redefined his legacy
as a sports executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve has earned his spurs,'' McNair said. ``I don't know how
I could have done it without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Steve is looking all grown up. He is leading efforts to
organize a campaign to come up with a nickname. He is involved in
stadium construction efforts, front-office hiring decisions, suite
and ticket campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The night we got the franchise, I woke up at 4 a.m. and it was
the same feeling I had when we had our first child,'' Patterson
said. ``It was like, `Oh my God, we're parents.' But I don't make
decisions in my life thinking I'm going to fail. This is going to
be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a feeling of vindication with all this because
there's a long way to go. But when we win the Super Bowl and we
have the most successful business operation in sports, maybe then
I'll answer that question.''

Ray gets motor running, earns Mall.com 500 pole spot
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FORT WORTH _ After having three engines blow up in practice
sessions this weekend, Greg Ray was just hoping to make the top
half of the field on his qualifying attempt Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Glidden/Menard car went on the track at Texas Motor Speedway
with an untested power-plant, but left the 1.5-mile oval two laps
later with the pole for today's Mall.com 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had motor problems all weekend long and haven't had a
chance to get into a rhythm,'' Ray said. ``We said we could give up
or we could dig down deep. We had the motor we are going to use in
the race. That's the call we made and we went with it. I'm
ecstatic. I think we have both barrels loaded and we're ready to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray's 216.107-mph lap in the Dallara/Aurora was 1.2 mph faster
than his best practice lap earlier in the day. Mark Dismore, who
won the pole at TMS in June, will start on the front row with Ray
after qualifying at 216.071 mph in the MCI Dallara/Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll gladly start second if I can get a win in the race,''
Dismore said. ``I'm going to go like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The best news for Ray is the three championship points he earns
for winning the pole, placing the Plano resident a little closer to
his first Pep Boys Indy Racing League championship.
</P>
<P>
   Ray has a 16-point lead over Houston's Kenny Brack entering
today's final race of the season. Sam Schmidt, who will start on
the outside of row 2, is 33 points behind Ray and also has a
mathematical shot at the title, which is worth a $1 million bonus
to the championship team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no telling how the race will play itself out, so those
three points could be huge,'' Ray said. ``The scenarios are
endless, but I'm not the kind of guy who dwells on it. We have guys
with calculators and their job is to keep up with that. But I can't
think about those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack, the defending IRL champion, will start the race on the
inside of row 3 in the Power Team G-Force/Aurora for the A.J. Foyt
team. Brack's lap of 214.593 mph was 1.4 mph faster than his best
practice lap. Brack had his tires in the grass on two turns of his
qualifying run.
</P>
<P>
   ``In qualifying you do whatever you can to help you get
around,'' Brack said. ``If it means going in the grass a little
bit, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he plans to go for it today and not take the cautious
approach, even if Brack and Schmidt are behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think you can go out there and cruise you are going to
be a lap down pretty quick,'' Ray said. ``The bottom line is you
have to be happy in the car, drive hard and not worry about
everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Team owner John Menard said he will do most of the worrying
while watching the race from the pits. Menard is looking to win his
second IRL title in the past three years. Tony Stewart, who Ray
replaced when Stewart moved to Winston Cup, won the championship in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably won't have any fingernails left at the end of the
race,'' Menard said. ``If we get a couple of breaks, we will be
there at the end, but it's easier said than done. I've been at this
long enough to know that so many things can go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   One factor that could change things dramatically for the race is
the cold front that is expected to drop the temperature to the low
60s for the start of today's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colder weather probably is going to help the Goodyear
teams,'' said Ray, who uses Firestone tires. ``All the cars are
going to be faster and it should make the racing incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the teams that use Goodyear tires have struggled in the
last two TMS races because hot conditions caused the tires to
blister or explode. Of the three contenders for the title, Brack is
the only one who uses Goodyear tires.
</P>
<P>
   So the cold conditions could help Brack in his quest to defeat
the hometown hero. Ray said he doesn't feel any added pressure to
try to win the championship in front of the home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in the car sweating, that's when I'm the most
comfortable,'' Ray said. ``It's the waiting that has been the
hardest. These three weeks (since the last race in Las Vegas) have
been agony for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was a day of agony for Brack's teammate, Billy Boat.
The man who won the June race at TMS in 1998 was one of the slowest
qualifiers. Boat will start on the inside of row 13 after posting a
lap at 209.881 mph in the Harrah's Dallara/Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   It seems odd that the two Foyt cars would be so far apart, but
Brack is using a G-Force chassis and Boat is using a Dallara.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating for the whole team,'' Boat said. ``We
have struggled to find speed all weekend. You run flat out all the
way around here, so it isn't rocket science. If we don't get this
corrected, it could be a long race for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Fisher, a 19-year-old Ohio native, will become the
youngest competitor in IRL history and only the second female.
Fisher qualified 17th at 213.074 mph.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM _ No one was happier to see Vitaly Potapenko come to
town last season than Tony Battie. Well, maybe the local Ukrainian
Society.
</P>
<P>
   But from a pure basketball standpoint, Battie was ready to offer
his services as cook, chauffeur, dog walker _ anything to keep the
beefy Potapenko around.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Battie was tired of having his 6-foot-11-inch,
240-pound frame rubbed out by bigger, stronger, meaner guys in the
post. He may be as tall as a center should be, but Battie is no
banger, and that's where Potapenko came to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough last year, me being undersized, underweight,
playing against the Shawn Kemps and Alonzo Mournings,'' Battie
said. ``There were guys who outweighed me by 40 pounds. Don't get
me wrong, I can hold my own, but we needed a true center. I'm
lacking in the weight. But V can hold his own. Now, if V beats 'em
down a little, I can take the fight from there.''
</P>
<P>
   He may have more fights than he'd like, but that's the nature of
the business and the new rules changes. Battie started at center
for the Celtics Friday night against the Dikembe Mutomobo-less
Atlanta Hawks and undoubtedly will see more of the middle than he
might otherwise like, given Potapenko's tendency to accumulate
fouls.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics want to keep him around wherever he might play and
signaled that affection with a six-year contract extension Friday.
The man once labeled ``El Busto'' in Denver (by now Nuggets coach
Dan Issel) is laughing all the way to El Banco in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a winner in basketball,'' he said,
temporarily forgetting last season's 19-31 submission by the
Celtics. ``The situation in Denver was just hard. I was going to
work my way through it either way, either to turn that team around
or be a more positive player myself and not let what was going on
with the wins and losses get me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Battie earned points for being a summer stalwart, first in the
California Summer Pro League and then in Boston at the Shaw's Pro
Summer League. Over 11 games, all Boston wins, he averaged 17.6
points, 5.6 rebounds, and 1.4 blocks. He averaged 27.9 minutes a
game, most of any Celtic in the two leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I thought I needed to play just to stay in shape
and work on my game,'' Battie said with a shrug. ``And the club
wanted me to stay, help them out, polish off my skills. I thought
that was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what Rick Pitino and general manager Chris
Wallace wanted to see. Pitino's only beef with the lanky Battie is
consistency. He'd like to see the good stuff more often. Bill Fitch
saw the same flaws in a young Robert Parish, wondering why the
Chief could do it in some games and disappear in others. The
Celtics believe Battie, while still a work in progress, is on the
right track and will be around for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pleased to acquire Tony, encouraged by his
development, and now comforted by the fact that he's going to be in
the fold,'' Wallace said Saturday. ``The comforting fact also comes
from looking over the list of potential free agents next summer. If
his development continues through this season, it was obvious Tony
could become a prime target of many teams throughout the league.
There's a shortage, leaguewide and in the college pipeline, of
players with that size, athleticism, and upside.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dana Barros, who missed the first two exhibition games because
of an illness in his family, was back at practice . . . The team
worked out for more than 2 1/2 hours, although Pitino said a large
part was watching film . . . Eric Williams may emerge as the
starting small forward, which is what he was two years ago before
Pitino dumped him to Denver. Said the coach, ``The big question
mark is, should we start Eric or bring him off the bench and help
the second unit because he's instant offense? Or make that first
unit really powerful? That's a big decision we have to make. When
you come off the bench with an Eric Williams, you've got a guy who
can really help your second unit. But Walter McCarty is playing
really well, also. It's a nice dilemma to have at this point.'' . .
. The Celtics will hold a public practice Sunday night in Portland,
Maine, something the NBA is ``asking'' all teams to do. They leave
for Charlotte and a weeklong road trip Monday night.

JUNIORS CAN STUMBLE WHEN MAKING JUMP

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is 29 years old now and is hoping the Long Island Ice Dogs
are the first stop on the comeback trail.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Wes Walz, who broke into the NHL with the Bruins after
being taken with Boston's third pick (No. 57 overall) in the 1989
draft, played a total of 73 games for Boston over three seasons
before going to the Flyers briefly in 1991-92. From there, he went
to the Calgary Flames for two years.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three seasons, Walz has been toiling in the Swiss
National League for EV Zug. In 1996-97, he had 24 goals and 46
points in 41 games. He had 52 points in 38 games in 1997-98, then
28 points in 20 playoff games, earning league MVP honors. Last
year, Walz had 22 goals and 49 points in 42 games and 12 points in
10 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   This tryout in the International Hockey League might lead to a
job elsewhere or it might not. When Walz came to the Bruins, he was
a highly touted youngster with a high-scoring resume as a junior
player in Lethbridge. He fought the Bruins on a contract, demanding
a one-way deal _ meaning he'd be paid the same if he played in the
NHL or was sent to the minors. Eventually, the Bruins gave in but
Walz wasn't ever the player they hoped for. President/general
manager Harry Sinden said at the time, and in retrospect, it was
the dumbest move he ever made.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a learning experience for me as a manager,'' said
Sinden. ``I still have them. Here was a kid we knew couldn't play
defense and because he couldn't, we knew he couldn't make the team
at the beginning, he'd have to go to the minors and learn. I ended
up giving him a one-way contract even knowing he couldn't make the
team and, sure enough, he couldn't make the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing if you think he's going to make the team and
he's good enough and you're wrong, then you're wrong. But if you
know and then you still do it, then you're stupid. With him, that
was the stupidest deal I ever made in my life. It was unbelievably
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches have forever preached that defense is a combination of
hard work and commitment. By and large, Sinden said, that's true.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little courage involved, but work hard and don't be
lazy and you'll be a pretty good defensive player,'' he said. ``He
was a good skater and a pretty good scorer but he let his coach
down and let his team down all the time defensively. Maybe he's
learned, maybe he understands the reality of it now. I hope he has;
he's a nice kid.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can understand the pressure of being a high-scoring
junior player expected to make an impact in the NHL, it's Bruins
forward Cameron Mann. Mann, taken No. 99 overall in the 1995 draft,
was a prolific playoff scorer in Peterborough of the Ontario
League. Mann had 46 points in 43 regular-season games for
Providence last season and added 14 points in 11 games during the
Baby B's run to the Calder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   At 22, he's having mixed results trying to break into the Boston
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw (Walz) play or anything, but there are a lot of
players coming out of juniors who are goal scorers,'' said Mann.
``There are certain players who come into this league and play a
totally different role. It's a matter of finding a niche and doing
what it takes to play here, finding what you can do to help the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some teams put a little more pressure on them because they've
had a lot of points and they think they're supposed to be able to
score points and do it right away, but it's not the way it goes.
You have to prove yourself every year and in every league. With
time, it could happen, but it may not. A goal scorer in junior
could become a checker.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Mann hasn't proven that he can play consistently in the
NHL, but that remains his objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I signed with the Bruins, they said I was going to score
20 goals and all this,'' he said. ``Maybe it was a little too much
pressure but it was all a learning experience. I definitely think I
can score 20 goals in this league someday, whether it be this year,
next year, or the year after.''
</P>
<P>
   Demographic check
</P>
<P>
   Fascinating statistics coming out of the league. Canadian
players make up just 56 percent of the NHL, down from 61 percent
last season, an all-time low. Europeans make up 28 percent,
Americans 16 percent. ``The perception will always be that it's a
Canadian game,'' said New Jersey Devils GM Lou Lamoriello, ``but
it's a worldly game right now.'' When you think about it, the
players most dominant in the league now all hail from somewhere
other than North America. Pittsburgh forward Jaromir Jagr (Czech
Republic) captured the Hart Trophy last season as the MVP and was
the scoring champ as well. Dominik Hasek (Czech Republic) has been
the top goalie in the league the last few seasons. Then there are
other big names such as Anaheim's Teemu Selanne (Finland) and
Colorado's Peter Forsberg (Sweden). Things have changed from when
Slava Fetisov, now an assistant coach with the Devils, first came
over from Russia. ``When I was in Russia fighting for my rights and
freedom against the most powerful anti-human rights system, I got
big support from Lou Lamoriello and (owner John McMullen),'' said
Fetisov. ``If they didn't support me, it would have been much
tougher. Ten years ago, when I came here, they didn't like us here.
I had a tough time when I came here. They didn't like us in the
dressing room. It's tough to play a team game when you feel like an
enemy in your own dressing room.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Ironed out
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Dessart, a member of the PR staff in New Jersey, is
scheduled to compete in the grueling Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii,
which includes a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and full
marathon (26.2 miles) . . . Former Islanders prospect Jeff Libby,
who lost his right eye in an accident during a minor league game
and who played one shift in the NHL in March 1998, was honored by
the team last week. Libby, who played for Lowell, was presented a
jersey with his name and No. 37 on it. ``The way the Islanders
treated myself and my family throughout this whole ordeal was
great,'' said the 25-year-old Libby, who is close to completing a
degree in finance at Southern Maine . . . There's plenty of head
scratching going on in Philadelphia. After the Flyers' loss Tuesday
to Washington, goalie John Vanbiesbrouck shouldered the blame after
giving up two goals to Peter Bondra in a span of 58 seconds. ``I'll
take a lot of the responsibility for it,'' said the Beezer. ``We
played a great game, definitely good enough to win.'' The Flyers
are a strange team indeed. Forward Mark Recchi, the team's only
standout in the early going, said it's a tough time but the club
will rally. ``There's alwayspressure when you don't get off to a
good start,'' said Recchi. ``Everybody starts to feel it every
night. The longer it drags on, the worse it gets.'' It doesn't help
that the Flyers received bad news last week about injured forward
Rod Brind'Amour. Brind'Amour underwent surgery on his broken left
foot and is expected to be out 6-8 weeks . . . In addition to
Jagr's new short haircut, he has also changed his way of
celebrating goals. Used to be Jagr would salute after a tally but
now he is tapping his chest with his right hand and then gesturing
the way Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa does after a home run. Jagr, who
unveiled the new move after scoring against Colorado's Patrick Roy,
said he wasn't sure why he did it. ``I don't control it,'' he said,
``it just comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Piling on Pilon
</P>
<P>
   Nice to see there's still no love lost between the Rangers and
Islanders. After Monday's 4-2 win over the Isles, Rangers coach
John Muckler didn't have much nice to say about defenseman Rich
Pilon, who cross-checked rookie Mike York and then was tossed out
of the game for giving referee Bill McCreary too much attitude.
``Pilon took some stupid penalties and finally got himself thrown
out of the game, so that's to our advantage,'' said Muckler. ``I
wouldn't want one of our guys to play as stupid as he did. I think
Pilon cross-checked a few guys and got in their faces a little bit
but if I was his coach, I would have been upset. I thought he hurt
his team.'' . . . Penguins wing Alexei Kovalev, a former Ranger,
said he's not exactly pining away for his ex-employer or ex-city.
``I don't really care how they do as long as we do good,'' said
Kovalev. ``I'm here now. The good things I have left about New York
are just my house, my big-screen TV. That's it. And my friends.
(The Rangers) gave me a chance, what else can you say? You can't
say, `Oh, they're really bad because they traded me.' This is just
part of the business. I don't really care what they do. I don't
have to live with them anymore.'' . . . The Ottawa Senators are
expected to set a deadline _ likely the end of November _ for
forward Alexei Yashin to return to the club and honor the final
year of his contract or be bound for another season. The NHL has
said the Senators have the right to declare that the year has
progressed too far for him to be able to fufill his obligations.
Yashin, currently under suspension, is skating in Switzerland . . .
Don't be surprised to see the Senators go up for sale. Owner Rod
Bryden has said that if the club doesn't receive government
assistance _ or the assurance of same _ by early December, he will
put the team on the block . . . Scott Mellanby, who slammed
head-first into the boards at the Molson Centre last week,
considered himself very fortunate. He suffered a slight concussion,
and despite losing consciousness briefly, he maintained his sense
of humor. ``That's the first time I've ever received a standing
ovation in Montreal,'' joked Mellanby, a Montreal native. Mellanby
felt well enough to go to Toronto Wednesday to present his father,
Ralph, with a SportsMedia Canada lifetime achievement award. The
senior Mellanby was executive producer for ``Hockey Night in
Canada'' for many years. The flight made Mellanby's already-bad
headache worse: He whacked his head on the overhead bin when he
stood up. ``But it's great to be standing,'' he cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Slush fun
</P>
<P>
   As hard as the league has worked to try to standardize the ice
in all arenas, there are obviously still some problems. Last
Wednesday, Lightning coach Steve Ludzik canceled part of his
practice because of ice conditions. ``Somebody was going to get
hurt,'' said Ludzik. ``The place was so feathered up we couldn't
use it.'' A Tuesday night workout for the benefit of season
ticket-holders, followed by a morning practice Wednesday, was too
much for the surface to handle . . . The struggling Blackhawks have
brought in world-famous Vladislav Tretiak, a three-time Olympic
gold medalist, to tutor goalie Jocelyn Thibault. Among other
things, Tretiak and Thibault studied videos of the young goalie's
8-1-1 run at the end of last year. ``I tell him he has to work hard
and be better mentally, be better on rebounds, concentrate more on
the puck,'' said Tretiak. ``I tell him, `You have been in the
league now four years. You are one of the best goalies. And you
must show everyone that every game.' '' . . . With an assist
against Vancouver Friday, Ron Francis tied former teammate Mario
Lemieux for sixth place on the all-time NHL points list. Asked if
he thought he would get a congratulatory telegram from Lemieux,
Francis joked: ``I'd rather he sent me a check for the deferred
money the Penguins owe me.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlie Casserly is looking for a job but he doesn't have to
send out his resume. It's on public display every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My resume is on the field,'' the former general manager of the
Washington Redskins said half-jokingly last week when asked how he
plans to go about finding a new home in football after 23 years in
the Redskins' front office. ``One thing about this job, it's out
there for everyone to see. Your sins and your good deeds are there
for everyone to see every day.''
</P>
<P>
   That Casserly is in this predicament is absurd on its face
because of what he has done in the past and what he pulled off over
the last year, but it is a sign of the times. It's a grim reminder
of reality in a world in which rich men with little to show for
their accomplishments but money buy what they want and discard whom
they want regardless of anyone's loyalty or productivity.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened to Casserly after a 35-year-old kid with a
Napoleonic complex named Daniel Snyder bought the Redskins from the
trust of the late Jack Kent Cooke for a spare $800 million this
spring and immediately announced that no one had to fear for their
job.
</P>
<P>
   About an eye blink later, 25 people were fired.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes, as Casserly understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the team went up for sale I felt all along if John (Kent
Cooke, the son of the longtime Redskins owner) didn't get it I
wouldn't be there,'' Casserly said. ``I was very strong in my
feeling that the Cooke family should retain the team. When it
became clear they wouldn't, I settled it in my mind pretty early
about what was likely to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened is what has happened in every franchise shift but
two over the past 15 years. The people in charge got fired. Fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dan Snyder took over, we agreed to disagree and focus on
the future,'' Casserly said. ``I had no time limit on what would
happen but I understood the situation and what the future was.''
</P>
<P>
   The future for the Redskins is bright because of a series of
moves Casserly made in the offseason while the franchise and his
own future were in flux. This counted for nothing with Snyder, who
brought in a former bag carrier in San Francisco named Vinny
Cerrato to run the football operation and kept Casserly around as a
``consultant'' until he could figure out a way to get rid of him
after training camp.
</P>
<P>
   This came after Casserly already had been thrown out once,
denied even an office by the trust running the team's sale. That
situation was resolved only when the commissioner's office stepped
in Feb. 11 and said someone had to run the place until it was sold,
so why not a guy who knew what he was doing?
</P>
<P>
   Re-enter Casserly. Yet as the free agency period approached,
Casserly didn't know who would buy the team, whom he would be
working (or not working) for, and what he would be allowed to do in
the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   There was a fear that the trustees would prevent him from
re-signing his own free agents or bringing in new ones because of
the cost, but that was resolved and he not only brought somebody
in, he began a process of rebuilding that has turned the 'Skins
into playoff contenders.
</P>
<P>
   First he convinced Vikings quarterback Brad Johnson that it
would be in his best interest to allow Minnesota to trade him to a
team that hadn't been to the playoffs since 1992 rather than to one
with his former offensive coordinator, Brian Billick, as the new
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly also had to convince Redskins coach Norv Turner that
even though Johnson had yet to heal from the injuries that had
ended his season prematurely in 1998, he was their quarterback of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   After succeeding on both fronts, Casserly then paid a ransom to
get him, sending a first- and second-round choice in the draft,
plus another second-rounder in the 2000 draft, to Minnesota. It was
all done four days after he'd been re-installed in charge.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, conspiracy-minded folks theorized that he was
destroying from within a franchise that soon would give him the
boot because Johnson had a shaky injury history and a contract that
ran out at the end of this season. In reality, he was bringing in a
quarterback who is now the second-rated passer in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approach I took was to do what's best for the franchise,''
Casserly said. ``I always felt we were caretakers for the fans of
the Redskins. That was the guiding light for me and the Cooke
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were criticized for the Brad Johnson trade. People said it
was a short-term move, but there was a method to the madness. We
felt we could get everything back with the fifth pick in the
draft.''
</P>
<P>
   On draft day, Casserly got more than that, shipping that fifth
pick to a desperate New Orleans team for its first (12th overall),
third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh picks this year and New
Orleans's first and third choices next April. He then traded three
of those choices plus next year's third to Chicago to move back up
to the seventh spot to take the guy he wanted all along, Georgia
cornerback Champ Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Casserly ended up providing a team he knew would soon fire
him with a hot young quarterback on the rise, potentially the
game's next great corner, and three No. 1 picks in the 2000 draft.
That left Snyder's team with a lot more flexibility than he left
Casserly with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the quarterback situation covered in all three areas,''
Casserly said. ``There's a quality starter, a quality backup in
Rodney Peete, and enough high picks to make a deal to get them a
highly rated one next year to assure the future if that's how they
want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   After accomplishing all that, Snyder knew only one thing for
sure. Charlie Casserly had to go.
</P>
<P>
   And so he did, working for a time as a consultant to Snyder
during training camp because, as Casserly put it, ``He made me an
offer I couldn't refuse,'' before returning to his home in suburban
Virginia to watch his daughter's volleyball team, work for ESPN
Radio, and notice for the first time in years that the leaves
change color in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the first time since I was 10 I haven't been
involved in football,'' said Casserly, who played at Springfield
College before he moved first into coaching and then management.
``It's been fun to do some things I've never had a chance to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get back into the game next year and I believe I
will, but I've kept busy. I'm not sitting around in depression.
ESPN Radio keeps me involved some and I've spent a few days
consulting with the people who are making a movie based on our 1987
replacement team that went 3-0. That's been fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been fun to have time to watch my daughter's volleyball
team and I took her and her girlfriends to a rock concert at RFK.
That was reason enough to get back into football.''
</P>
<P>
   What he also has done is spend a lot of time reviewing game
tapes to keep up to date. He gets those tapes from friends on many
teams but he doesn't get a one from the Redskins, his employer of
23 years. He asked once and somebody told him they were kind of
busy at the moment. He didn't ask again.
</P>
<P>
   So for the time being one of the game's best minds is planning
for a future that if new Houston owner Bob McNair is smart will
include a Texas accent. Casserly reviews film of the present, plans
for the future, and occasionally thinks about the past if someone
asks. When he does, he remembers not the end of his time at Redskin
Park but all the years before, the ones in which he was part of
Super Bowl teams run by George Allen and Joe Gibbs and where he
built one on his own after he took over from Bobby Beathard.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, he thinks about the Cooke family and how they ran
things in a different time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day so many people were fired was very emotional,''
Casserly said. ``I'd been with those people for an awfully long
time. Many were my friends, not just co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cookes ran it like a family. George Allen ran it like a
family before Jack Kent Cooke came back East. Everyone cared for
each other and helped each other when there were problems. That
characterized the organization then.''
</P>
<P>
   Then is not now, as Casserly knows but refuses to say. He is
still a Redskin fan, still watches on Sundays, still cheers for a
victory. But he watches from a different seat now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go over to the stadium,'' Casserly said. ``It would be
kind of awkward to sit in the stands, I think. So I watch on TV. I
still want to see the Redskins do well. It's my team. The only
difference now is when the game's over, I change the channel and
watch another game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the bearer of bad news many, many times to players. I
always marveled at how they handled it and I hoped if my time came
I would do it right. I think I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Workout video
</P>
<P>
   Whoever said winning cures everything could find no better proof
of that than in St. Louis. For the past two years wide receiver
Isaac Bruce has been hobbled with hamstring problems and coach Dick
Vermeil has been less than complimentary about Bruce's work habits.
Bruce was not a part of the team's offseason workout program and
was critical of the length and intensity of Vermeil's 2 1/2- to
3-hour in-season practices, as were many other veterans. This year,
St. Louis is 4-0, Bruce has 22 catches for 466 yards and six
touchdowns, and is on a pace to exceed his 1995 Pro Bowl year, when
he caught 119 passes for 1,781 yards, so no one is complaining. But
it is more than that. Vermeil has gone so far as to show tapes of
Bruce's practice habits to his teammates as a lesson in how things
should be done . . . Bruce, by the way, intends to appeal a $2,500
fine for throwing a ball into the stands after scoring his fourth
touchdown last Sunday. Bruce believed it was within the rules
because he was off the field when he did it. The league claims that
had he handed the ball to a fan or tossed it into the stands, there
would have been no fine. So what's the fine for? He threw it too
hard. Give me a break. The ball went more than 100 feet up into the
stands at the TWA Dome, so he got fined for distance? The reason he
was fined is that the toss was all over the highlight shows the
next two nights. If that wasn't the case, why didn't he get fined
double for the ball he punted into the same stands in the same game
after his second touchdown? They don't call this the No Fun League
for nothing . . . As with any team coming out of obscurity, the
Rams have some unexpected stars. The biggest is former Arena League
quarterback Kurt Warner. He's so big there's a jersey crisis in St.
Louis. NFL Properties had not made a deal to produce a Warner shirt
with his No. 13 on it, so when he took the league by storm, it
could not get shirts to stores. It couldn't just order Puma to
print them, either, because nothing is that simple anymore. First
the league needed permission from the players' union, which took
nearly a week. Puma then had to get blank Rams jerseys and get them
to its factory in Indianapolis, which didn't happen until last
week. Now the process of printing up the hottest number in St.
Louis this side of Mark McGwire has begun, but the shipping of
replica jerseys won't begin for another week. The fastest way to
get a Warner jersey is to log on to NFL.Com and order an authentic
one custom-made for $200, but even that takes three weeks because
of the backlog . . . How much has the absence of Mark Chmura hurt
the Packers? No Packer tight end has a reception since Chmura was
forced out after the season's second game, perhaps for his career .
. . A familiar problem has resurfaced in Tampa Bay, where the Bucs'
lack of offense continues to hold back one of the NFL's best
defenses. Tampa had promised to throw deeper this year to loosen up
opposing defenses and give its running game some room. But even
though Trent Dilfer has completed more than 60 percent of his
throws, the Bucs are averaging only 6.3 yards per pass, the same
problem that haunted them a year ago . . . There have been many
plans proposed for the league's realignment to four divisions of
four teams each. Almost all involve moving the Seattle Seahawks out
of the AFC and into the NFC West. Here's another suggestion. Why
not shift Baltimore to the NFC East to form a natural rivalry with
the Redskins and send Dallas elsewhere? Here's one possibility:
</P>
<P>
   AFC East: Jets, Patriots, Dolphins, Bills.
</P>
<P>
   AFC Central: Browns, Steelers, Bengals, Colts.
</P>
<P>
   AFC South: Houston, Titans, Buccaneers, Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   AFC West: Raiders, Chiefs, Broncos, Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   NFC East: Giants, Eagles, Redskins, Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   NFC Central: Bears, Lions, Packers, Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   NFC South: Falcons, Panthers, Saints, Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   NFC West: 49ers, Rams, Cardinals, Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock mystery
</P>
<P>
   Old friend Jimmy Hitchcock had seven interceptions last year for
the Vikings but things have been kind of slow this year for him and
his team. Hitchcock played in a unit that made 18 picks a year ago,
but this year after five games the Vikings have but one
interception, a sign that all their problems are not centered
around their offense. Still, because Minnesota is scoring so
infrequently when compared with a year ago, Hitchcock and the rest
of the secondary are not seeing as many passes and hence not as
many opportunities to grab them. ``I got my hand on the ball 30
times last year,'' Hitchcock said. ``I had three, four, five passes
defensed a game. Not this year.'' Thus far, he's had six, which
leads the team and is another point of view on the Vikings' odd
problems . . . Not everyone is happy about the Redskins' offensive
explosion this year. The owners of Domino's pizza franchises around
Washington have lost more than $2 million because of the unexpected
offensive fireworks. Before the season, Domino's announced a
promotion designed to increase business on traditionally slow
Monday nights. They would take $1 off for every touchdown the
'Skins scored the day before. That seemed safe enough since a year
ago Washington scored only 40 touchdowns all season, an average of
a $2.50 discount per pizza. So what has happened? Washington has
scored 19 touchdowns entering Sunday's game with the Cardinals to
lead the league and on the day after it scored seven touchdowns,
people were ordering the $6.99 pizza all over town and eating for
free. Although Monday sales are up considerably, the 143 Domino's
around Washington are rooting for a defensive struggle . . . Word
is that before the Redskins brought in 71-year-old defensive guru
Bill Arnsparger at midweek to help coordinator Mike Nolan shore up
the worst defense in the league, they explored importing former
coach Richie Petitbon. Petitbon was approached by a third party and
declined the offer. Washington is giving up 433 yards a game . . .
If you don't think Redskin running back Larry Centers will be fired
up to play his former employers, the Cardinals, guess again. ``I
need to do about $1 million worth of damage,'' Centers said. ``Then
next game I'll do another $1 million. You know what I'm saying?'' .
. . No one is happier about the recent $700 million price tag on
the new Houston franchise than the estate of Leon Hess, which is
selling the Jets. Although the Jets have no stadium (they play in
Giants Stadium), their value will skyrocket now, or so the people
handling the sale at Goldman Sachs say . . . As for Los Angeles,
the NFL still intends to have a franchise there, it just won't be
an expansion one. The plan is to finance a stadium through the
league and then let one of the present teams with stadium problems
move out there if Al Davis doesn't find a way to beat everyone to
it. The hope among the owners had been to retain a lease on the
Hollywood Park property but that fell through in part out of fear
that Davis might challenge such a move.

MILLOY A SMASH IN THE SECONDARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ His name is Lawyer, but his teammates call him
Leader.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Milloy's crashing hits and aggressive style have earned
him the respect of teammates and opponents that an All-Pro strong
safety should get.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who take on the Miami Dolphins Sunday in a huge
divisional game, all are trying to be more like Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the defense really rallies around him,'' said
defensive tackle Chad Eaton. ``We know that every time he goes out
there he's going to put his body on the line. He's going to hit
somebody so hard that something good is going to happen for us,
whether it's a turnover or just an attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy is to this year's team what Ty Law was to last year's.
He's a star defender in the final year of his contract, and before
long Milloy will cash in here or be playing in another locale.
</P>
<P>
   Playing for $490,000 this season, he may be one of the NFL's
biggest bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Milloy, who plays like a linebacker, would be devastating
to this defense, just as the no-holds-barred mentality of Ted
Johnson has been sorely missed since the linebacker tore his left
biceps in a training camp intrasquad game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing the same thing I've been doing,'' said Milloy. ``I
lead by example. I'm still the same. But I know my effort
definitely can't slack off because we don't have Willie (Clay) or
Ted. You have to do a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week against Kansas City, Milloy took on the big bruising
backs of the Chiefs, Bam Morris and Donnell Bennett. After the
game, he iced his right shoulder, an indication that even though he
gave, he also received.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I play,'' said Milloy. ``Somebody has to do it. You
have to have at least one or two people on the defense who are
willing to sacrifice, and I'm one of those guys. I do a little of
everything. I'm glad people are starting to notice it. I really
love the game and I show that when I line up.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy does not appreciate having his style of play termed
``reckless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a smart player also,'' he said. ``I pick and chose when
I'm gonna throw my body in there or not. I know when to take angles
when angles are needed. Preparation puts me in the right position.
I'm around the ball a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   With Chris Carter taking the spot of Milloy's mentor, Clay, at
free safety, Milloy has had to do more. He started the season
calling most of the signals in the secondary, but he's been able to
give some of those duties to Carter in recent weeks. Clay wasn't a
big hitter and neither is Carter. Law and Steve Israel are good
cover corners, so Milloy's biggest job is to provide the
intimidation factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I make a big hit, it sets the tempo, not for the whole
game, but for that series or for a quarter or a half,'' he said.
``You can't dictate the game as an individual, but you can hope to
boost other individuals. If I make a big hit or big play, people
feed off that. I like to take it to the game and not let the game
take it to me. Don't let the game get you first, or you'll end up
on your back injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his style, Milloy has remained injury-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you start worrying about getting hurt, you'll probably
get hurt,'' said Milloy. ``I think I tackle properly. There's a
proper way to go about it. I know how to tackle correctly and I
know when to hit somebody hard and when to lay off a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have more than 150 tackles, not everything is going
to look picture-perfect. I see the ball. I have a knack for finding
the ball. I can be up like a linebacker and be effective or I can
be in the middle and knock people's heads off. I don't want to be a
one-dimensional player. This defense has allowed me to expand my
skills and my awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy hasn't been around as long as, say, Henry Thomas, who is
sought out by teammates for advice. Players go to Milloy and shake
their heads in respect for what he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the guys say, `How do you do it? How do you keep that
level of intensity?' '' said Milloy. ``I don't brag. I don't want
to bring attention to myself. I'm starting to get recognized around
the league, and going to the Pro Bowl was attention enough for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   With Pro Bowl appearances comes the pressure of having to live
up to that standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about that stuff,'' said Milloy. ``The way I
attack the game is strictly to get to the Super Bowl. Individual
accolades come with success. I can't control Pro Bowl votes, and
I'm happy about that, because I don't want to play that game. If we
won the Super Bowl and I didn't go to the Pro Bowl, I'd be happy.''

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ kidnap a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Condras, upon learning of the information accompanying the
charge, cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, our minds are just racing,'' said Shirley Condra. ``What
difference would this have made to little Pamela if we would had
found a police officer that night? But we didn't know about the
abduction. We wonder now if the man was hiding in the bushes,
watching us walk around his truck. And why did he pick our
church?''
</P>
<P>
   By 4:30 p.m. police officers and dogs were well into their
search for Pamela Butler along the Kansas River.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 p.m. darkness signaled a close to the day for most of the
30 officers who had descended upon the rail yard. Headlights and
dust filled the horizon, carrying detectives, dogs and equipment
back to the police station. A few officers remained to guard the
area overnight.
Friday
</P>
<P>
   While hundreds of officers searched near Grain Valley Christian
Church, authorities also were searching a wooded area behind
Pitcher Cemetery in Independence, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters and photo teams gathered in a rutted, dirt parking lot
just to the south.
</P>
<P>
   As FBI spokesman Lanza sat in his car with his door open and
talked to a reporter, these words came across his police radio:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a body.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about 12:45 p.m. Lanza immediately shut his car door.
Soon, he and nearly a dozen news vehicles were headed to Grain
Valley, 14 miles to the east.
</P>
<P>
   In Grain Valley more than 100 officers had walked shoulder to
shoulder through the woods, hoping to literally stumble across
evidence of Pamela's whereabouts. They found her body, covered by
sticks, about 12:30 p.m. and soon after that found her clothes.
About 4:25 p.m. a white coroner van carried her body away.
</P>
<P>
   When the news arrived at Pamela's home, Cherri West was
nervously smoking a Marlboro, talking about the worst week of her
life.
</P>
<P>
   Strangers had spent the last three days decorating the front of
the house with teddy bears, filling the kitchen counters with
casseroles.
</P>
<P>
   For three days people had cried with her, prayed with her, tried
to comfort her.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could ease the pain, or prepare Cherri West for that
moment, some 67 hours after her daughter disappeared. The moment
when she learned her daughter was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope no one else in this community has to go through this,''
West said.

   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ stolen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They tried to find a police officer and report the truck. But
after driving around for a while in downtown Grain Valley without
seeing an officer, they decided to go home.
</P>
<P>
   By 8:30 p.m. Nelson had arrived at his mother's home in Kansas
City, Mo. They spoke briefly, talking about work and the weather.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 p.m. Nelson was seen coming out of the basement of the
house with another white male. When confronted by a neighbor,
Nelson said he'd been working on the plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Condras were watching the late news and
heard about a little girl who had been abducted by someone in a
white Ford.
</P>
<P>
   They called police immediately.
</P>
<P>
   By now, about five hours later, Pamela's family and friends had
printed and distributed hundreds of fliers bearing her name and
description.
</P>
<P>
   Around 11:30 p.m., police said, neighbors noticed Nelson again
outside his mother's house, this time washing the white Ford and
cleaning the interior, pausing frequently to rub his hands and
glance up and down the street.
Wednesday
</P>
<P>
   In the early morning hours, Jackson County sheriff's officers
and Grain Valley police searched the fields and woods near Grain
Valley Christian Church but found nothing suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the day had begun at a feverish pace.
</P>
<P>
   About 9 a.m. residents in Kansas City, Mo., alerted police to
the location of an abandoned white Ford.
</P>
<P>
   It had been thoroughly cleaned. Still, police discovered several
strands of hair matching Pamela's under the seat.
</P>
<P>
   By 10:30 a.m. people had started to attach themselves to the
story. Worried parents stopped by to comfort Pamela's mother, to
share their sympathy, and reporters had started camping out at the
family house.
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning police were back in Grain Valley, searching now in
greater numbers, walking the fields and the woods with specially
trained dogs.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, news had leaked out that police had traced the license
number to a foundation business and had learned that Nelson had
been in possession of the white Ford. So they'd put a name to their
search, although officially he was wanted just for questioning, not
as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson had a history of burglary and an outstanding assault
warrant.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 p.m. Nelson was seen walking near the home he shared
with a girlfriend. Within minutes more than 100 police were
scouring the area.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Pamela's house, the search was wearing on Cherri West,
the mother: ``Time is getting longer,'' she said wearily. ``I
figured they'd at least find her today.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 p.m. Nancy Nelson, the mother of Keith D. Nelson, called
The Kansas City Star to complain about the treatment her son was
receiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is awful,'' the 43-year-old woman said. ``It's like
vigilante time, you know? Keith has always stuck up for
people....When he was in jail in Butler (Mo.), his cellmate was a
child molester. When that guy started bragging about what he had
done, Keith put him in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after 9 p.m. at Grain Valley Christian Church, a husband
and a wife locked up. The day's searches had turned up nothing;
still, they were horrified to think their little church had become
a focal point in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   As they left, a tearful woman drove into the church's parking
lot. Gone were the police and crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here because God told me that little girl is out there
somewhere,'' said Rebecka Bell, peering out into the scrub brush.
``I'm not crazy, but this has affected me so much. I've been
shaking and trembling all day about it. My church held a prayer
vigil for Pamela.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us with children are hugging them a little closer
tonight.''
Thursday
</P>
<P>
   Stuffed animals, flowers and posters from Pamela's classmates
were stacked on the front porch of Pamela's home. Young children
played in the cluttered area, oblivious to the tense situation
surrounding them. A pastor told the family he would be around if
they needed him on such a tough day.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in midmorning FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza reflected on the
search.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing has been mind-boggling. It's been an
extraordinary set of events.''
</P>
<P>
   Police were following leads, Lanza said, but not doing big
searches, nothing like Wednesday. He believed Nelson was still
nearby, because he had family and friends in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not accusing anyone of harboring him, but there's the
possibility that his whereabouts are being kept a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the intensity of the search, and the media spotlight on
it, hopes for a resolution were fading fast. Among themselves, many
police were wondering whether they would ever find a body, the
notion of finding Pamela alive having all but vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on Nelson suddenly intensified when a call came in
that he had been spotted in a white van. It led to a police chase
that was broadcast live on local television. A passenger in the van
was wanted for outstanding traffic tickets. However, he was not
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch a new lead emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Torrez, a Kansas City, Kan., Police Department employee,
had a hunch Nelson might be hiding along a stretch of the Kansas
River, near the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad tracks where
her husband was working. Driving slowly, she spotted a man under a
bridge. He got up and tried to flee by entering the river and
swimming away, but an injured leg slowed him down. Railway workers
were pulled the man to shore and held him for police.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 p.m. the United States officially filed kidnapping charges
against Nelson. In the accompanying affidavit, two FBI agents
recounted an interview with a day laborer who had worked with
Nelson on Sept. 29. The man said Nelson told him he ``would like to
kidnap a girl.'' MORE

KIDNAPPING TRIGGERED INTENSE SEARCH, ENDING WITH DISCOVERY OF
BODY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ For a little girl, the weather Monday was
too good to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old Pamela Butler and her best friend, 11-year-old
Holly Woods, rode with Holly's mom and brother out to an old rail
bridge over the Kansas River.
</P>
<P>
   The girls had the day off from school, and the plan was to spend
it outside, playing, enjoying every minute.
</P>
<P>
   They hugged and laughed and joked. Holly's brother, Timothy
Woods, wanted to take pictures of the girls at the bridge, so they
mugged for the camera. At one point he lifted a bicycle out of the
back of his pickup and let Pamela ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think you could go a little bit faster than that,''
Holly's mom, Teresa Woods, teased as the 65-pounder poked along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could if my legs were longer,'' Pamela answered, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``So sweet,'' Teresa Woods thought. ``This is a good day for the
girls, the sort of day they'll remember for years.''
</P>
<P>
   As they played by the river, an employee at a shop near Pamela's
house in Kansas City, Kan., noticed a white Ford F-250 pickup
crawling past the modest homes, the Mexican restaurants, the
markets and the industrial buildings. The driver looked to be a
brown-haired white man, 20 to 30 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's suspicious,'' the employee thought. ``Is he casing
us?''
Tuesday
</P>
<P>
   Early in the afternoon, construction workers near Grain Valley
(Mo.) Christian Church _ about 25 miles from Pamela's house _ saw a
white pickup driving along the hedgerows of a wooded area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that odd? Why is that guy driving back here?'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must be a hunter looking for a good spot,'' another replied.
</P>
<P>
   The white Ford and its driver _ wearing a red T-shirt and blue
jeans _arrived back at Kansas City, Kan., between 4 and 5 p.m.
Tuesday. The driver apparently stopped at an area salvage yard.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, Pamela _ wearing a white sports bra and tan
pants _ grabbed her school math book and skipped next door,
searching for Holly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wondering if Holly could help me with my homework?'' she
asked. It was a common request, a common occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   But this day Holly was not around, so Pamela went back home.
Half an hour later, Tim Woods stopped by Pamela's house and noticed
her lacing up her roller skates.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes she was scooting up and down the block.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, the white truck pulled up to a salvage yard
about three blocks from Pamela's home. An employee leaving the yard
for the night stopped to talk with the truck's driver _ who later
would be identified in court documents as 24-year-old Keith Nelson.
Nelson told him he was waiting there to buy a Dodge Colt from his
uncle.
</P>
<P>
   As the employee left, Nelson three times offered to lock up the
salvage yard, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes Pamela's neighbors noticed a white Ford pickup on
their street. The driver, wearing a red T-shirt and blue jeans, was
lying on the seat.
</P>
<P>
   As Pamela, clutching a soft drink and cookies in her hand,
skated toward the back of the pickup, her sister Penny, 11, watched
from the front porch of their house. Penny noticed that the
driver's side door was opened slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the driver leaped from the white Ford and snatched
Pamela around the waist.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela screamed.
</P>
<P>
   Penny screamed.
</P>
<P>
   The man shoved Pamela into the truck through the driver's door.
Pamela kicked and fought. He shoved her across the seat. Still, she
fought. Still the sisters screamed.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few seconds, and the pickup truck was tearing off
down the street. Penny, still screaming for help, saw Pamela
continuing to fight her attacker inside the white Ford. Later she
would say that as the kidnapper sped past her, he smiled at her and
made an obscene gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wilt, a neighbor, heard the screaming and raced after the
vehicle in his own car. He got close enough to write down the
Missouri license plate number but lost contact.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Pamela's house an older sister called police to report
the kidnapping. It was about 5:45.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City area police had spent the last month discussing how
to react to just such a crisis. The consensus was that it would be
impossible to overreact.
</P>
<P>
   Children are not often abducted by strangers, they knew. But
very few times when strangers had snatched children did those
stories have happy endings. Usually the children had been injured
within three hours of the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   So they had decided on a plan to get the word out, quickly, to
television and radio stations, hoping that flooding the airwaves
would alert people to the urgency of the message and create fast
leads. It was a plan that had gotten results in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan was not quite ready for use Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And so, at 6 p.m., the tail end of Tuesday rush hour, the white
Ford anonymously passed thousands of motorists as it made its way
from Kansas City, Kan., through downtown to the eastern edge of the
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. in Grain Valley, Shirley and Carl Condra noticed a
white Ford parked behind their church _ a truck that did not belong
there.
</P>
<P>
   The white pickup was a Ford F-250. There was no driver. No keys
were in the ignition switch. They jotted down the license plate
number.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Condra noticed that there were black garbage bags tied
up with yellow ties in the back of the truck. She cupped her hands
to the glass to see what was in the interior: a brown plaid afghan
was draped in the front seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an odd thing to have in a work truck,'' she said to her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truck is probably stolen,'' he said. MORE

Friends recall Chamberlain's love of life
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LOS ANGELES _ It was almost as if they had to come to see for
themselves if the unimaginable was true.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of the 800-plus who attended the memorial service
Saturday at City of Angels Church of Religious Science could fathom
the fact Wilt Chamberlain was actually dead.
</P>
<P>
   It never occurred to them Chamberlain was mortal. Everyone
seemed to think that like the mind-boggling records he amassed over
the course of his 14-year NBA career, Chamberlain would live
forever.
</P>
<P>
   That tells you all you need to know about Chamberlain, whom many
call the greatest basketball player _ and some say the greatest
athlete _ of all time.
</P>
<P>
   It might sound absurd, but everyone seemed to assume
Chamberlain, whose recorded feats bordered on the mythological,
could not be touched by death.
</P>
<P>
   That changed Tuesday, when it was learned Chamberlain had died
at his Bel-Air, Calif., home from congestive heart failure at age
63. He was cremated.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates, opponents and admirers _ Bill Russell, Jerry West,
Elgin Baylor, Nate Thurmond, Chet Walker, Bill Walton, Connie
Hawkins, Billy Cunningham, Alex Hannum, Bob Lanier and Walt
Hazzard, along with friends such as Jim Brown and actor Bernie
Casey, all came to pay their respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt Chamberlain was one of the greatest athletes who ever
lived,'' Brown said. ``He was a beautiful human being. He was very
independent and was a great friend of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the sea of flowers and photos from his career, speaker
after speaker took the microphone and began to tell Chamberlain
stories, few involving basketball. Those stories brought knowing
nods and bursts of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   But that was Chamberlain's style. Nothing was by the book, not
even this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to see all those smiles,'' said former Globetrotter
Meadowlark Lemon, one of Chamberlain's closest friends, ``because
`Dippy' (a shortened version of `The Big Dipper,' Chamberlain's
preferred nickname) always had a smile on his face. We want to keep
a smile on our faces when we think about The Big Dipper because
that's how he was.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that only late in his life did Chamberlain receive
the praise from his contemporaries that he so desperately sought
for so long. And news of his death seemed to have softened many who
resented Chamberlain's dominance of the sport, either on the court
or in the public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain was recognized simply by his name _ Wilt. Years
later, the name, ``Michael,'' would evoke a similar response, but
Chamberlain didn't have Michael Jordan's exposure on ESPN, CNN or
NBA.com.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the NBA was more of a regional sport, but the name
``Wilt'' was recognized everywhere. That led to petty jealousies
that have only recently been set aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel unspeakably injured by what happened,'' said Russell,
once a good friend who only in the past few years had reconciled a
long-standing rift between himself and Chamberlain. ``He was an
integral part of my life and a good friend. My memories of him are,
first of all, he sent me through hell on so many nights. But it was
not a rivalry, it was a competition. And in an odd way, we both
came from the same place. We were very tall at a very young age,
and people always approached us from a different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to be honest with ourselves, we had to be how we are. And
the things I remember the most are his unbridled, unrestrained
curiosity. Curiosity is intelligence with inquisitiveness. Once you
talked to him on the phone, you know you spent most of your time
listening. And as we got older, the more we liked each other
because we knew that basically we were joined at the hips.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so I'll just say that as far as I'm concerned, he and I
will be friends for all of eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, the basketball star who refused to allow himself to
be defined in such narrow terms, was a giant in more ways than just
his 7-1, 300-pound physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   Following his retirement in 1973, Chamberlain devoted himself to
what he called ``my charities,'' using his fame to collect money
for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, Operation Smiles, the Maurice
Stokes Foundation, youth sports and _ to the surprise of many who
remember Chamberlain for his claim he had sex with 20,000 women _
women's athletics.
</P>
<P>
   It was, all pointed out Saturday, a full life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so busy doing, that I'm not surprised he had a tired
heart,'' said Chamberlain's sister, Barbara Lewis. ``He gave so
much of it to others. We had such a gift of love and that gift
spread right through him. He ended up being a giving, loving and a
big-mouthed person _ but a loving person.''

Williams, Texas Tech rock Colorado 31-10
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LUBBOCK _ There are more than 20 flags flying in the West Texas
breeze above Jones Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Texas Tech doesn't know that six flags are standard for an
amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the Red Raiders welcomed 46,424 into their home
stadium Saturday to watch their version of a roller-coaster ride.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time this season, Tech followed a disappointing
loss with an inspired victory, making Colorado this week's victim
by knocking off the Buffaloes 31-10 in a Big 12 Conference game on
homecoming weekend. It was the Red Raiders' eighth consecutive
homecoming-day victory.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman tailback Shaud Williams led the way Saturday, rushing
for 230 yards and two touchdowns on 21 carries, as Tech improved to
3-3 overall and 2-1 in conference play to tie Texas and Texas A&AMP;M
atop the Big 12 South standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we preach (to our players), if they don't learn
anything else playing football, is don't quit,'' Tech coach Spike
Dykes said. ``So, the season starts and we don't quit when we lose
a game. We don't quit when we stink it up. I think people expect
everybody to quit. We're not going to quit. We might stink it up,
but we're not going to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I love these guys so much. They don't have any quit
in them. They don't care what anybody says.''
</P>
<P>
   It has to be tough to quit when you are leading the pack as Tech
is. As poorly as the Red Raiders have looked at times, it is almost
a wonder they are in as good a position to win the Big 12 South as
anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's up in a season of ups and downs, started out as if it
would be another down. It looked bad enough for Dykes to describe
his team's play early on as ``buzzard puke.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams' play was a far prettier sight.
</P>
<P>
   The first-year player from Andrews, who entered the game with
218 yards rushing this season, had his biggest day as a collegian
and the most yards for a freshman in school history, accounting for
exactly half of Tech's 460 yards of offense.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' day included runs of 35, 61 and 66 yards, all on
touchdown drives. Tech's fourth touchdown march was only 27 yards
and Williams did the honors by scoring from three yards out to cap
that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about what Shaud was able to do,'' Tech
fullback Sammy Morris said. ``It's amazing to see him hit full
speed in two steps. He was just breezing by them. We were blocking
for him, but he was running hard and with a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' 61-yard run around the left side led to Tech's first
seven points and after a fumbled kickoff, he side-stepped
linebacker Fred Jones in the backfield to get free for his
three-yard score, as Tech built a 17-0 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had them sold on the pass and it just split like
the Red Sea. I just put a move on one guy, and it was off to the
races,'' Williams said of the 61-yarder that came on a draw play.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Red Raiders' spunk early in the third period that
kept Colorado at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Tech chose not to rest on its second-quarter laurels, coming out
with a long pass on its first play after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   On first down from the 20-yard line, quarterback Rob Peters
threw deep over the middle to Tim Baker, who went airborne to catch
the ball 50 yards downfield, but he had it knocked away just as one
foot hit the turf. The officials ruled the loose ball a fumble, and
Robbie Robinson scooped it up for Colorado and returned it 23 yards
to the Tech 47.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Mike Moschetti hit John Minardi on a fly
pattern down the right sideline and the Buffs were back in the game
at 17-7.
</P>
<P>
   No problem for the Red Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Williams went to work on the next play from scrimmage, following
a block from Morris to go 66 yards around left end to the Colorado
14. Peters threw a strike to Darrell Jones two plays later for a
13-yard touchdown and Tech had responded in barely more than a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I though that it was critical when they came out and answered
a score with a score,'' said Colorado coach Gary Barnett, whose
team turned the ball over six times in falling to 3-3, 2-1 in the
Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real important that we scored there because for a
second, they took the momentum away from us,'' Williams said. ``We
went back out there and got us a score. I think that was the
difference in the game right there, the fact that we took the
momentum back from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech had one more answer in it before this one was over.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado cut the lead to 24-14 with a field goal early in the
fourth quarter, but Williams again ignited a touchdown drive with
his running to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   Two carries, one for 11 yards and another for 35, moved the Red
Raiders to the Buffs' 20. After Peters hit Baker on a slant to the
six-yard line, Williams finished off the march with a run around
left end.
</P>
<P>
   Williams took the ball around the corner and appeared to be
stopped at the one when a Colorado player slammed into him,
apparently forcing the 5-8, 175-pound Williams out of bounds.
Williams managed to reach out with his left hand and place the ball
just inside the pylon for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy always tells me, when you get the ball down there, there
shouldn't be anything to keep you from scoring,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, can Tech do something to keep its pattern of up-and-down
play from showing up with a downer next week?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the team you saw today, that's the real Tech
team,'' Williams said. ``Hopefully, this is the team that will
finish the season.''

New Rockets jump on chance to showcase talents
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Carlos Rogers had waited for an opportunity to show what he could
do. He never doubted that chance would come. He never questioned
his ability.
</P>
<P>
   He likely played out the situation in his mind as he bided time
in Portland waiting for his deliverance. A trade. A new team. A new
career. All he needed was a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you,'' he said as word began to spread that this
lesser-known part of the six-player package that came to the
Rockets for Scottie Pippen could play. ``Didn't I tell you? All I
needed was a chance. Now, I've got my chance. I knew what I could
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Cato always knew he could block shots, if given playing
time. There was so much more Walt Williams could do besides shoot,
if only someone would ask. Even Shandon Anderson, though an
important part of the Jazz's success and a coveted free agent,
imagined himself with the role and responsibility of a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what every player wants, an opportunity,'' Anderson said.
``You just want to go out and do the best you can, not put any undo
pressure on yourself. But you also know, `I have my shot. I want to
make the best of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The retooled Rockets have changed more than their velocity. They
still have the customary frontcourt Hall of Famers, Hakeem Olajuwon
and Charles Barkley. They have a foursome of young players drafted
in the past two seasons _ Steve Francis, Kenny Thomas, Bryce Drew
and Cuttino Mobley _ carving their niches in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But with the summer overhaul, the Rockets also have a group of
veterans that find themselves with much larger roles, and often the
best opportunities of their careers to play and perform. And if the
first two preseason games are any indication, they bring a hunger
to achieve enhanced by their wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good situation,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said. ``We've had success with guys that had been in the CBA
before. Now they're up in the big league and they want to take
advantage of that. Now we have a lot of guys that have been in the
league, but haven't had the opportunities, or the opportunities
didn't work out well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cato and Carlos Rogers are both guys really jumping at the
(new opportunity) and making the best of it. Whenever you see
someone doing that, it's good. If Cato didn't inspire you, with the
intensity level and hustle and the energy he expended, you're
probably in the wrong business.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 12-blocks triple double Friday, Cato stole the scene. But
he is typical of the influx of Rockets players who have approached
the preseason as if making a statement with every new opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you have something you have to prove to yourself,''
said Williams, who has started both preseason games. ``You don't
want to think about trying to make a impression, but there are some
feelings like that. You really aren't there so much to prove
yourself, but to help the team win. But it's hard to help the team
win when you're not playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Increased playing time, he said, can do more than just offer
more chances to shoot. It offers a chance to get a feel for the
game that is more difficult when coming in for short stints. With
more time, one play can lead to another as players adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get more time, you get involved in different
situations and get a chance to do more things,'' Williams said.
``Shandon can show all the different things he can do. Carlos
Rogers can show he can do more things than he has showed in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Anderson, who had gotten playing time before joining the
Rockets, said the feeling is different as a starter. It is a role
that he said he sought when he was a free agent to measure himself
by how well he responds to the greater stake in a team's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to question yourself,'' he said. ``You're always
asking yourself, `Can I be a starter in the NBA, can I be a starter
on a winning team?' I don't think it's a doubt. It's wanting to
prove it to yourself that you can go out there night in, night out
and be a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can come off the bench and some nights make a difference.
But when you start, you feel the responsibility to be there all the
time.''
   But with that said, Anderson said the Rockets can benefit from
their collection of professional role players. If the wait for this
chance served one purpose, it humbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, after one or two years in the league, you get used
to playing a role,'' Anderson said. ``All athletes are going to say
they want to play. Every guy on this team can put the ball in the
basket. But because of where we've been, you're not going to have
any selfishness. If a guy doesn't touch the ball every other play,
he will still concentrate on contributing any way he can.''
</P>
<P>
   They never could get used to not playing. But with those dues
paid, the Rockets find themselves with a group of players ready to
cash in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun knowing you're going to have an opportunity to go out
there,'' Cato said. ``You always want to do your best. You want to
showcase your talents. It takes talent to get to this level. You
can't get here with just talk.''
</P>
<P>
   It almost makes the wait worth it, if not just to make one
appreciate the opportunity, but to inspire the effort to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to get the chance, it's huge,'' Williams said. ``It's
what you always wanted.''

KNIGHT TAKES ONE STEP BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Travis Knight seemed this incompatible oddity of a
tender giant, a 7-foot man who walked so softly he seemed fearful
of crushing egg shells with each step. Yet it was only the latest
setback in Knight's second life as a Los Angeles Laker that caused
him to walk so very carefully around the L.A. Southwest gym
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Knight severely sprained his right ankle in the Lakers' first
exhibition game and is expected to be out for three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A career that could use a jump start was suffering from a false
step.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly the fairy-tale ending, but it's all right,''
Knight said. ``What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight should be threatening Mr. Universe by now. His second
coming as a Laker has been anything but smooth. Last year he was
traded back to the Lakers from the Boston Celtics and expected to
get time at power forward and as center Shaquille O'Neal's backup.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Lakers went into their mad scientist phase,
experimenting with the volatile addition of Dennis Rodman. The
ensuing explosion hovered over their entire season. Then there was
the midseason trade for power forward J.R. Reid. Knight all but
disappeared at the end of the bench.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged a career-low 4.2 points per game, appearing in just
37 of their 50 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of things going on last year that I didn't
understand, but that's last year,'' Knight said. ``I really
couldn't do nothing about it, so I'm moving on this year. I'm
excited and hoping to play.''
</P>
<P>
   A new season brought a new coach, Phil Jackson, a new offense,
the triangle, and new hope.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual for a veteran, Knight joined the Lakers' summer-league
team and started learning the triangle under assistant Jim
Cleamons. Knight was a guy who needed to make an impression, who
needed to make the most of his preseason opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the preseason is about, trying to define your
role,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An opportunity now lost to a tender ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, but Phil's a smart guy and if he wants to use me,
he'll find a way,'' Knight said. ``If he doesn't, then he doesn't.
He's the coach and they're paying him a lot of money for that
ability and I'm sure he'll do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are also going without the injured Kobe Bryant, but
Jackson and his staff know exactly what the highlight-reel Bryant
can do. Knight, though, needed the opportunity to impress.
</P>
<P>
   And there are lots of new bodies, including Benoit Benjamin, who
may have supplanted Knight as O'Neal's backup. Knight is still
without a defined role, save for forward-center.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping Spree?: In something less than a shocking development,
the New York Knicks are unhappy with the tardy Latrell Sprewell and
are reportedly listening to offers. One report has them interested
in talking to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt Sprewell has the ability to fit into the
triangle, but that is hardly the primary concern with the 6-foot-5
guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latrell really hasn't wanted to fit in anywhere,'' Jackson
said. ``One of the things we've tried to do is try to have people
who want to be part of what we're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the perfect kind of offensive player to have in this
system as far as his speed, his running, his ability to create, his
ability to move quickly without the ball. He can definitely play in
this system and definitely play for us, but we want players that
want to be here and be compliant, and he has never shown that.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: Jackson today gave the Lakers their first day off since
camp opened: ``We need a day off. This is a good opportunity for us
to take a deep breath, relax and step back. There's diminishing
returns on how hard they can go, and then come back and learn some
things.'' Forward A.C. Green said the day off was welcomed: ``I'm
tired of beating up on these guys, and I'm tired of them beating up
on me. I want to go beat up on my pillow now.'' ... The Lakers cut
free-agent guard Donald Williams to get down to 18 players. Jackson
said there likely would be three more cuts next week.

Sanford, Green help Houston KO North Carolina
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Offensive guard Greg Brown was right on target
when he promised the night before that Houston running backs Ketric
Sanford and Mike Green each would rush for more than 100 yards
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With Sanford and Green pounding North Carolina's defense all day
and the Cougars' defense limiting the Tar Heels to 126 total yards
and eight first downs, the result was a 20-12 victory for the
Cougars that somehow came down to the last play.
</P>
<P>
   It took linebacker Wayne Rogers' deflection in the end zone of
North Carolina's final pass to enable Houston to come away with its
first non-conference road victory since a 45-43 decision over
Minnesota in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Brown had predicted, Sanford and Green turned out to be
the dominant forces. Sanford finished with 157 yards on 21 carries
and scored on a 61-yard run, and Green added 130 yards on 24
carries and had a one-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our team meeting at the hotel (Friday night), big Greg
stood up and said the offensive line was going to do the job, and
they lived up to it,'' said Green, who missed the Cincinnati game
the previous week with a sprained ankle. ``We had the running
lanes, and I just did all I could to run hard and get that extra
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Sanford, who moved to No. 2 on UH's career rushing list
ahead of Robert Newhouse: ``We knew we had to run the ball well and
put it on our backs. That's what coach (Kim Helton) wants us to do,
make the big plays in the running game and keep our offense on the
field. We wanted to come in and show people we're no joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars' defense was no laughing matter for Tar Heels
redshirt freshman quarterback Luke Huard, who was harassed all day.
Houston (4-2) limited North Carolina (1-5) to 39 net yards rushing
after sacking Huard four times for minus-31 yards. Huard was making
his first start in place of sophomore Ronald Curry, who ruptured
his Achilles' tendon a week ago in an overtime loss at Georgia
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we saw of him (Huard), we felt we could come at him
hard with the blitz,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing the ground game early resulted in a 14-0
first-quarter lead and allowed UH to control the tempo of the game.
The Cougars ran 74 offensive plays to 47 for the Tar Heels and led
in time of possession 37:04 to 22:56.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in planning to run 45 or 48 times and throw it about
25, and then we were able to control the clock like we did,''
Helton said. ``We were very fortunate to win. We caught them at the
right time. We made some plays early and they hung in and with four
seconds left, it's anybody's game.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Sanford and Green, Helton said, ``We have two pro runners
who are going to make those kind of plays. Mike's ankle was better
and Leif Penn was a little banged up (sprained thumb), so today it
was Ket and Mike getting the carries. A week ago, it was Leif (with
96 yards against Cincinnati to go with Sanford's 134).
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, we have a tough blitz package for anybody, let
alone a kid coming off the bench without a lot of reps.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Hill's fumbled punt return, a fumbled snap in the end zone
by punter UH Jeff Patterson that led to a safety, and two other
fumbles in scoring territory helped keep the Tar Heels within
range.
</P>
<P>
   Green's one-yard TD run with 7:40 remaining in the first quarter
ended a 15-play, 80-yard opening drive that was kept alive by a
pair of third-down passes to Brandon Middleton by quarterback Jason
McKinley (11-of-19, 119 yards, one interception).
</P>
<P>
   UH made it 14-0 on its second series as Sanford accounted for
all 80 yards on four carries. Sanford's big gainer was a 61-yarder
down the sideline after he found an opening and outran the UNC
pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   A safety made it 14-2 and then UH failed to move the ball after
being backed up by Brian Schmitz's 51-yard punt, North Carolina
started from the Cougars' 44. One play after a UH offsides penalty,
Huard's first collegiate scoring pass _ a 39-yard connection to
Kory Bailey _ looked easy after Houston botched its coverage.
</P>
<P>
   After Hill fumbled a Schmitz punt away at the Cougars' 25, Josh
McGee kicked a 38-yard field goal with 4:19 remaining in the half
to narrow Houston's lead to 14-12.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cougars' defense never permitted the semblance of a
threat in a scoreless third quarter, keeping the Tar Heels pinned
down at their end of the field and limiting them to one first down
and five net yards. For the second half, North Carolina totaled
three first downs and 35 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took two fourth-quarter field goals _ 37 and 30 yards
_ in the fourth quarter to put some distance between the teams. All
18 plays of the two 44-yard drives were on the ground. After all,
that was the theme of the day.

USC INSPIRED BY VISIT WITH ALI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ USC players were stunned to get an impromptu
visit from boxing legend Muhammad Ali on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ali spent more than three hours at the team hotel, where he
performed magic tricks, told jokes and signed autographs. Ali also
viewed the Oscar-winning documentary ``When We Were Kings'' with
the team, which focused on his mid-70's title fight with George
Foreman in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ali lives on a farm formerly owned by gangster Al Capone near
Michigan City, Ind., which is where the Trojans stayed and is about
30 minutes from South Bend.
</P>
<P>
   The Ali visit was set up by USC security chief Xavier Suazo, who
is friends with the police chief in Michigan City, who is a friend
of Ali.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredible. It was really inspirational,'' USC free
safety David Gibson said. ``We need to play and have fun. Kind of
what Ali did.''
</P>
<P>
   While USC met ``The Greatest,'' Notre Dame was addressed by
``The Great One,'' former hockey star Wayne Gretzky, at its pregame
rally Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Strong as Steele: Overshadowed by the loss was a terrific
performance from USC linebacker Markus Steele, who had 12 tackles,
a sack, a fumble and two tackles-for-loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a normal typical game. I was just trying to be
around the ball,'' Steele said. ``You never know what's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury report: USC offensive linemen Donta Kendrick (ankle),
Eric Denmon (knee) and Matt Welch (shoulder) all re-aggravated
nagging injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Denmon started before being hurt on the first possession of the
second half. Another injured starter, Brent McCaffrey (ankle)
played behind Trevor Roberts at left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Record receptions: USC wide receiver R. Jay Soward caught 10
passes for 101 yards and set a Notre Dame-opponent record with 23
career catches. The previous record of 22 receptions was shared by
former USC receiver John Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Soward finished his career with 296 yards receiving against the
Irish.
</P>
<P>
   Fast starters: With its 24-3 halftime lead, USC has outscored
opponents 122-37 in the first half this season. But the Trojans
have been outscored 109-79 in the second half and 71-41 in the
fourth quarter and overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Shutout span: When Notre Dame kicked a field goal with 1:17
remaining in the first half, it ended a seven-plus quarter
scoreless streak against the Trojans. Notre Dame had not scored in
119 minutes, 20 seconds. USC shut out the Irish in the final two
quarters in 1997 and in all four quarters last season.
</P>
<P>
   Good hands: USC recovered its 12th and 13th fumbles of the
season, which leads the nation.

SPORTS COLUMN: VALENTINE JUST NEEDS TO MANAGE HIMSELF BETTER 
(HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Win, lose or rainout, Bobby Valentine is always a
lightning rod for the second guess. Whatever happens, there's
always something he didn't do that he should have done. But now
that the Mets have stayed alive in the National League Championship
Series with a 3-2 victory over the Braves, maybe Friday night's
second-guessers will stop hounding him.
</P>
<P>
   The situation: ninth inning of Game 3, Mets trailing by 1-0,
Benny Agbayani on first base after a walk, none out and New York's
latest public enemy No. 1, the left-hander John Rocker, on the
mound for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of bunting to get the tying run to second base with one
out, Valentine sent up last weekend's hero, Todd Pratt, to hit for
Robin Ventura. But Pratt fanned. Melvin Mora flied out. Rey
Ordonez's grounder forced Agbayani at second and the Braves had
taken a 3-0 lead in the four-of-seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Why hadn't Valentine inserted a pinch-runner for Agbayani, then
had Ventura or somebody else bunt?
</P>
<P>
   ``Benny is one of our faster guys,'' the Mets' manager said,
``and I didn't have anybody that could bunt Rocker. He's tough to
hit. I think he's tougher to bunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's answer fit every manager's hole card: he knows his
players better than any of the second-guessers do.
</P>
<P>
   And for the Mets, he's the ideal manager, as feisty as this
often frustrated franchise wants to be. He deserves a substantial
contract extension beyond next season. In guiding the Mets into the
NLCS despite that seven-game losing streak in September, he has
shown he can manage a team and manage a game.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, who is smart but not as smart as he thinks he is,
just needs to learn how to manage himself better.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games of this NLCS with the Braves, he has
sometimes appeared to have been trapped a move or two behind Bobby
Cox, but the Braves' boss minimized his strategic genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've outfoxed anybody,'' Cox said. ``Both of us
are going to make moves, and some of them are going to work and
some of them don't. If they didn't work for us, I would've been the
dumb guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Good managers come not only in all shapes and sizes, but also in
all psyches. Joe Torre and Cox, to name two, know how to talk to
their players and to the news media always trailing them.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine doesn't always know how. His high-strung personality
will always clash with high-strung players, as it did with Pete
Harnisch (now in Cincinnati), Todd Hundley (now in Los Angeles) and
Bobby Bonilla (now on the Mets' bench as an occasional
pinch-hitter).
</P>
<P>
   His high-strung personality will always react to reporters' hard
questions as uncomfortably as if he were facing a firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him what sounds like a simple question and he often will
pause, momentarily, as if trying to figure out if the questioner is
trying to trap him, then he will answer. So his answer is often
more complex than the question. And sometimes more
self-incriminating.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, he just blurts something out, as he did in
Philadelphia three weeks ago. While answering reporters' questions
after the fifth of seven straight losses, he suddenly offered that
he should be dismissed as manager if the Mets didn't qualify for
the NL wild card.
</P>
<P>
   And for most of the following week, most fans agreed he was to
blame. But when the Mets salvaged the wild card, he never got much
credit.
</P>
<P>
   As Valentinestruts and chews gum and flashes signs in the
dugout, his managerial image suffers from having to compete with
Torre, the manager across the Triborough Bridge who always seems to
be sitting serenely in the Yankee dugout, who always seems to be
loved by everybody, even by his players. Even by his principal
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Torre's success has made it more difficult for Valentine to be
accepted. Torre took over the Yankees in 1996, Valentine succeeded
Dallas Green as the Mets' manager late that same season. Torre has
led the Yankees to two World Series titles with an opportunity for
a third. Valentine finally led the Mets into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine is a throwback to other managers who, for whatever
reason, created more headlines than their players. In his own way,
Valentine is Billy Martin without the barroom brawls. He's Leo
Durocher without Laraine Day and Frank Sinatra. He's Casey Stengel
without the triple talk. He's Earl Weaver without the
umpire-baiting. He's Tommy Lasorda without the Hollywood pals.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Bobby Valentine has been anywhere near as successful,
at least not yet, as those managers were, but he's the same breed.
All he has to do is learn how to manage himself better.

DEVILS BEAT ISLANDERS, 4-1  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Sheldon Souray of the Devils and Brad
Isbister of the Islanders dropped the gloves before the game was
three minutes old. But it was the Devils who played with more
aggression and purpose the rest of the way and skated away with a
4-1 victory Saturday night at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Gomez scored his first goal in the National Hockey League,
in the second period, and also set up goals by Krzyzstof Oliwa and
Bobby Holik in the third. The captain Scott Stevens iced the
victory with an empty-net goal after the Islanders had pulled Felix
Potvin, who faced 41 shots in his fifth start in as many games for
the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, before a crowd of 15,017, extended the Devils'
unbeaten streak to four and improved their record to 4-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ferraro scored the lone goal for the Islanders (1-4-0),
who have lost three in a row. Ferraro's goal came against Martin
Brodeur, who has started all six games for the Devils. Brodeur
faced 30 shots Saturday night and looked just as sharp as he had in
the late stages of the victory over Anaheim two nights ago.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders Coach Butch Goring reprimanded his players in Friday's
practice for their lackadaisical play in their previous appearance,
a 2-0 loss to Atlanta, and said poor effort by his players would
not be tolerated. Isbister was one of Goring's players who paid
attention to the speech and he battled with Souray just 2 minutes
25 seconds into the game during a scramble near Brodeur, a fight
that set the tone for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   All the Islanders came out with plenty of enthusiasm and
aggression early in the game. Less than a minute after the
Isbister-Souray fight, the Islanders opened the scoring. Tony Hrkac
intercepted a lazy pass by Lyle Odelein in the Devils' zone.
Ferraro took Hrkac's pass and beat Brodeur over the glove from high
in the slot for his first goal in his second appearance of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro's debut with the Islanders came four days ago against
the Rangers, making him only the second native of Long Island to
play for the Islanders. Richie Hansen, in 1976, was the first.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur's and Potvin's sharpness thwarted the shooters from both
teams for the rest of the first period, but there wasn't much
Potvin could do on Gomez's goal. Potvin squared himself at Sergei
Nemchinov with the puck and had little time to turn around to face
Gomez when Nemchinov got the pass across with a backhander to tie
the score at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez's goal came 1:35 after the first intermission during the
first manpower advantage for the Devils. The power play started 27
seconds into the period when Claude Lapointe tripped Randy McKay.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils applied plenty of pressure for the rest of the
period, but were unable to capitalize even though they took 16
shots in the period. One of the best chances for the Devils came at
9:26 when Potvin denied Bobby Holik at his right doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders also had their share of chances in the period.
Their best opportunity came during a penalty to Nemchinov late in
the period, but Brodeur gloved Mariusz Czerkawski's shot from the
low slot to keep the teams tied going into the third period.

Brees, Purdue pass Michigan State silly
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. _ For two weeks, the coming-out party had been
something of a dud. If any statements were made, they were old,
familiar ones.
</P>
<P>
   That tricked-up offense? Never make it with that stuff in the
Big Ten, kids. And that undersized quarterback from Texas with all
the gaudy numbers? Wait until he comes up against the big boys of
the league, the ones the schedule-maker had spared him up until now
</P>
<P>
   ``People were saying we'd lose four straight after we lost to
Michigan and Ohio State,'' Drew Brees, the junior from Austin
Westlake, said in sizing up his team's image.
</P>
<P>
   So what did Saturday's 52-28 rout of No. 5 Michigan State say
about Purdue?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we ain't that bad,'' Boilermakers coach Joe Tiller said
with an aw-shucks smile.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently. This time, Tiller's 20th-ranked team made its case
with a vengeance before a sellout crowd at Ross-Ade Stadium, making
its presence felt in the Big Ten race in the process.
</P>
<P>
   That wide-open offense that has drawn snickers from Midwestern
purists rolled up 568 yards, with Brees completing 40 of 57 passes
for 509 yards and five touchdowns. Wide receiver Chris Daniels set
conference records with 21 catches and 301 yards receiving, scoring
three times.
</P>
<P>
   Even the defense _ something of an afterthought in Tiller's
flying circus _ got into the act, limiting the Spartans to 278
yards, forcing six turnovers and bailing out Brees after two of his
four interceptions were returned for Michigan State scores.
</P>
<P>
   So much then for the Spartans, who were coming off an emotional
win over Michigan a week earlier. MSU scored first, then watched as
Purdue responded with four unanswered touchdowns. Aric Morris'
76-yard interception return got Nick Saban's team (6-1) back within
a touchdown at 35-28 late in the third quarter, but the rally
fizzled after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very humbling game, and we've realized vanity can be
dangerous,'' Saban said. ``This game can slam you in a hurry, and
it did to us today.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue (5-2) had something to do with the slamming, of course,
and cornerback Michael Hawthorne said the chatty visitors _
particularly wide receiver Plaxico Burress _ helped keep the fire
burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burress is big,'' Hawthorne said. ``And a lot of talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans' hero against Michigan wasn't so big in this one,
finishing with three catches for 50 yards and one touchdown. And
while he was critiquing the losers, Hawthorne added that he hadn't
been particularly impressed with MSU quarterback Bill Burke, who
completed 21 of 33 passes for 234 yards but was intercepted four
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't like to be pressured,'' Hawthorne said.
``Sometimes, when you do things people don't like, they fold. I
think he folded.''
</P>
<P>
   MSU's opening drive suggested the Spartans had come ready for
better things. Burke moved his team 91 yards, getting the last 18
on a pass to Burress.
</P>
<P>
   Then the extra point hit the right upright, and things went
downhill quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Brees found Daniels for a 51-yard score, then hooked up with
Vinny Sutherland for a 27-yarder after a Michigan State turnover. A
10-yard pass to Daniels made it 21-6, and a seven-yarder to Randall
Lane ran the count to 28-6 early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers nearly extended the margin, but a 37-yard
scoring pass to Sutherland was called back by a penalty that soon
become a 14-point swing. After moving the ball to the Michigan
State 15, Brees was hit on a blitz and fluttered a ball to
linebacker T.J. Turner, who returned it 88 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans pulled within 14 on a two-point conversion before
Brees found Daniels with a four-yard touchdown pass with 1:46 left
in the half. It was 35-14 at the break, with Brees (344 yards, five
touchdowns) and Daniels (12 catches, 200 yards, three touchdowns)
already having turned in a nice day's work.
</P>
<P>
   That work wasn't quite over.
</P>
<P>
   A one-yard run by T.J. Duckett narrowed the gap to 35-21 midway
through the third period, and Morris' interception return made it
35-28 a few minutes later. A 37-yard pass from Brees to Daniels set
up a one-yard scoring run by Brees with 1:28 left in the period,
and the Boilermakers closed the deal in the fourth quarter with a
23-yard Travis Dorsch field goal and a 12-yard return of a Burke
fumble by David Nugent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense really played well, and it was fitting that the
last touchdown was scored by them,'' Tiller said.
</P>
<P>
   Next up: No. 2 Penn State, the last Big Ten unbeaten, comes to
West Lafayette next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like there's going to be a Big Ten team
without a loss this year,'' said Brees, whose big day may have
breathed new life into his Heisman Trophy hopes. ``I guess Penn
State is the only one left with a chance to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   After bringing Michigan State's run to an emphatic end, the
Boilermakers wouldn't mind playing a similar role here next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this offense, and the way this defense played today, we
have a chance against anybody,'' Tiller said.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans will help spread the word. Big Ten purists may
still hold their noses, but no one is laughing at Purdue anymore.

Rice rushes for 413 yards, rolls to 49-7 win
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEAL FARMER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
There had been some running commentary about the ineffectiveness of
Rice's triple-option offense this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The offense finally threw a knockout punch, slipping in a 49-7
haymaker against San Jose State on Saturday at Rice Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls gained 413 rushing yards on a school-record 81 carries
in the Western Athletic Conference mismatch. Halfback Anthony
Griffin scored three touchdowns, quarterback Chad Richardson scored
two, and backup fullback Derek Gary showed excellent speed to gain
101 yards and one TD.
</P>
<P>
   Another measuring stick of the offense's effectiveness was that
punter Travis Hale never kicked.
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to say the offense has caught up to the level the
defense has played at this season. Rice had the ball for 10
possessions, scored touchdowns on seven, lost a fumble on one,
missed a fourth-down run on another and had the ball as the clock
ran out.
</P>
<P>
   The Rice offense dominated with 18- and 15-play scoring drives
among its Saturday work schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense kept the ball for so long that it kept us on the
sidelines and rested,'' said Rice safety Jason Hebert, who returned
two interceptions against the Spartans for a total of 66 yards.
``Sometimes we had to stretch (leg muscles) on the sidelines
because they kept the ball for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first quarter, we had 11 plays on defense. I felt like I
was barely in the game. The offense is playing real strong, and we
have been playing tough all year (on defense). That's a tough
combination to have.''
</P>
<P>
   One microcosm of the offense was Griffin. On the first four
times Griffin touched the ball, he scored three touchdowns and was
not touched by a Spartan on any of them. He was all alone when he
caught a 31-yard pass from Richardson up the middle early in the
second quarter for a 14-0 lead. Griffin went around the right side
for a 13-yard scoring run later in the period on which he started
right, juked defenders and then walked into the end zone to the
left. He then showed his 4.29 speed on a 43-yard touchdown run
early in the third quarter for a 35-0 lead. His long run looked as
effortless as the SJSU defense looked listless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great blocking and great play-calling by the coaches,''
Griffin said. ``I feel like I will get more playing time. I just
have to get the practice time. I've had injuries (groin). A lot of
backs got to do some things, but it all goes back to great
blocking.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory gives the Owls (4-3) a four-game winning streak,
with a grudge match next week at home against TCU. The Owls now are
12-1 in all WAC games played at Rice Stadium. Saturday's victory
also gives Rice something it has craved for years _ the Owls are
3-0 in league play and are alone in first place, one game ahead of
five teams in the loss column.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes back to spring,'' Gary said. ``We knew we had a good
team coming into the season, even though we started 0-3. We still
believed and focused and knew that everything would start to click.
The defense has been playing great the whole time. We just had to
wait on the offense, and now it is finally coming together. We look
forward to the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense continues to be a strong point for the Owls,
inducing four Spartan turnovers _ two interceptions and two fumble
recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls almost pitched a shutout. But on fourth-and-two from
the Rice three, San Jose flanker Casey LeBlanc fought his way up
the middle for a three-yard touchdown late in the third quarter and
salvage something for San Jose State (3-4, 1-2).
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans gave up 91 points in their Texas two-step, dropping
a 42-0 decision at TCU last week. SJSU yielded more than 800 yards
combined in Houston and Fort Worth. It's enough to make a fan
wonder how in the world the Spartans defeated Stanford 44-39 and
almost got by LSU before falling 29-21.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose State coach Dave Baldwin credited Rice fullback Jamie
Tyler for helping blow the game open early.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans had tried to minimize the quarterback's impact in
the Rice offense, after Richardson had gained 168 yards and scored
three rushing touchdowns last week in Hawaii. But Tyler ran wild,
finishing the game with 83 yards and a two-yard touchdown run. And
that's despite playing sparingly in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we were going to take away their quarterback,''
Baldwin said. ``Then they gave the ball to the fullback on first
down (five of six first-down plays in the opening drive). But the
way the fullback was running, it was second-and-six,
second-and-five and second-and-four.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice coach Ken Hatfield was pleased with the intensity the Owls
showed, especially since there was no practice last Monday after
returning from Hawaii on an eight-hour plane ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming off the Hawaii week, people have always told me the
toughest game is not Hawaii but the week afterward when your body
has to recover,'' Hatfield said. ``(But) I think when I looked
before the game, I saw about four of their players were hurt and
could not play. I watched them in warmup and thought they would
have a difficult time, and they did.''

SPORTS COLUMN: ROCKER GETS ANOTHER NIGHT IN FUN CITY 
(HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Rocker had to duck from a plastic water bottle
heaved at him by one of the lunatic fringe in Shea Stadium Saturday
night but he could not dodge trouble on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' relief pitcher had proved his impetuosity by
strutting into the Mets' homey little delicatessen in Flushing,
N.Y., and criticizing the fans, and then personally bolting down
the Mets' dessert.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday night Rocker raced into the game in the eighth
inning, had a double steal committed behind him, and then
surrendered a ground-ball single by John Olerud worth two runs as
the Mets rebounded to beat the Braves, 3-2, and keep their season
alive.
</P>
<P>
   The game turned around after Bobby Cox pulled a double switch
when Rocker came in the game. Cox sent in Ozzie Guillen to replace
Walt Weiss, the better defensive shortstop, and Guillen could not
stop Olerud's single up the middle, as the tying and winning runs
scored.
</P>
<P>
   The best National League team of the decade still holds a 3-1
lead in this four-of-seven-game series, courtesy of the 1-0
thriller Friday night, in which Rocker shut down the Mets in the
ninth. ``You can't say the things I said and then blow the game,''
Rocker admitted Friday in a moment of deep reflection.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, trying to win a second World Series in their
glorious run of eight straight post-season appearances, keep coming
up with talent.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have produced this 6-foot-4-inch left-handed brute, who
has the gall to come sprinting in from the bullpen, and also the
chutzpah, as we say in New York, to stand up to the louts who chant
ugly things at him and his teammates like Chipper (he'll always be
``Lar-ree'' in Flushing) Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't appreciate the vulgarities, the sexually
explicit language, our mothers and our sisters,'' Rocker said after
Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The same chants Rocker hears were echoing around Yankee Stadium
during the Fisk-Munson hostilities of the mid-'70s, but very few
athletes have come into New York and made a public issue of the
crude language and abusive taunts.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher jawed with fans during the last week of the regular
season, and he kept it up through the press, calling the fans ``a
tired act.''
</P>
<P>
   This did not sit well with his manager, Bobby Cox, who played
for the Yankees in 1968-69, and loves walking around the city and
chatting with the knowledgeable and respectful fans. ``I'm still
going to work on his relations with people and fans,'' Cox said
Friday. ``We've done that all season. And I really don't condone
the words in the papers and things like that. He really does have a
problem with fans when they're yelling at him up close.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker said it is not just a matter of words. ``Quarters, water
bottles; I didn't see any batteries this time,'' Rocker said.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker did go into Cox's office Friday and apologize for
escalating the tension. ``I'm just 23 years old,'' he said,
apparently forgetting he turns 25 Sunday. ``I'm a young guy,
immature. I'll learn my lesson. I don't want to be a pain and a
bother to my teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't regret anything I said,'' he added. ``It's a shame
you need armed police officers out there. We're playing our
national pastime.''
</P>
<P>
   He speaks with a raw form of idealism that has not been totally
tarnished by his nearly two seasons playing a billion-dollar game
in huge stadiums. He is six years out of Presbyterian Day High
School in Macon, Ga., and he attended Mercer University there for a
while, majoring in political science.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be little political or scientific about his
approach to life, but he admits he uses the grossness of the fans
to pump himself up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys would lose focus, but John seems to feed off it,''
said Mike Remlinger, another talented reliever, out of Dartmouth
College. ``The guy is fearless. He combines a great attitude with
great stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, even as a phalanx of police officers infiltrated the
ball park, Rocker was seen pointing an index finger at the fans:
``I was telling them I was getting into their heads, pushing their
buttons,'' he said later.
</P>
<P>
   Then he decided to be a little political: ``Look, the Mets have
great fans. They had 50,000 people out here cheering for them.
Ninety-eight percent of them are great. They have a great team,
perennial All-Stars like Piazza, guys like Olerud and Ventura.''
</P>
<P>
   After stopping the Mets Friday, he disappeared for half an hour,
exercising to disperse all that adrenaline coursing around in his
system.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of energy, he could soon be matched up with the most
inflamed fans of all, the vein-distended, eye-bulging,
oath-chanting Bleacher Creatures, who easily surpass their Shea
Stadium brethren in ugly chants and ripping ball caps off the heads
of naive visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody told Rocker that the Shea Stadium werewolves are just a
lounge act for the denizens of the deep at Yankee Stadium. Rocker
smiled, as if to say, ``No biggie.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly if the Yankees can somehow bypass Roger Clemens,
the Braves could indeed be back in Verbal Abuse City by the middle
of next week, playing in Yankee Stadium, where the Bleacher
Creatures have been intentionally partitioned into a lethal
diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played in Yankee Stadium,'' Rocker said, referring to the
three interleague games last July. ``It's a great place, full of
great history.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to form, the big lug from Macon may be
part of Yankee history _ the first visiting ballplayer to stride
into Yankee Stadium and lecture the Bleacher Creatures on their
manners. Talk about your Fall Classic.

 &HT;    Sweep slips away from Braves
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It couldn't have been any sweeter for the Mets and
their raucous fans.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud was at the plate in the eighth inning with runners
on second and third and the Mets' season on the line. He had two
strikes against him, and Braves' closer John Rocker, the most hated
man in New York City, was on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud, 0-for-9 in his career against Rocker, chopped a single
just off the glove of shortstop Ozzie Guillen to drive in two runs
and give the Mets a 3-2 victory, their first of the National League
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olerud got a hit against the unhittable,'' Mets manager Bobby
Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux and Mosato Yoshii will face off today in Game 5. The
Braves, now leading three games to one, will take another shot at
advancing to their fifth World Series of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets put on the tying run in the eighth when Roger Cedeno
singled up the middle off John Smoltz. Rey Ordonez popped up a bunt
attempt for the first out, but the Mets kept coming. Cedeno stole
second and Melvin Mora drew a walk from Mike Remlinger. So Bobby
Cox went back to Rocker, who had shut down the Mets in Games 1-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta reliever was greeted by a bottle and a cup thrown
from the stands as he burst out of the bullpen. This time he was
unable to retire Olerud, whose sixth inning home run had given the
Mets a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   As Olerud's hit bounded past Guillen, Cedeno and Mora scored
easily. Mora leaped into the air as he crossed the plate with the
winning run. He also scored the winning run on a wild pitch to give
the Mets a 2-1 victory over Pittsburgh on the final day of the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves spent the first seven innings of Saturday night's
game taking a little pitching payback. Rick Reed blanked them on
one hit through seven innings as he outdueled Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   But in three pitches in the eighth inning, the Braves reclaimed
the lead. Brian Jordan and Ryan Klesko each homered, knocking out
Reed with one blow to left field and one blow to right.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, the only member of the Mets' NLCS rotation who hadn't lost
to the Braves this season, held the Braves to nothing but a Bret
Boone single through the first seven innings. The Mets promptly
dismissed Boone's single when Mike Piazza nailed him trying to
steal second.
</P>
<P>
   Reed had the Braves bouncing into eight groundouts, and they hit
only four balls beyond the infield. He struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   New York fans had waited all series for the Mets to stand up and
do something against the Braves. The first blow came from Olerud,
who was 2-for-13 in this series before he stroked a Smoltz 1-1
fastball over the right field fence.

 &HT;    Red Sox hammer Clemens, Yankees
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A blue ring of 13 Boston police officers _ who knows
how many plainclothes men _ encircled New York's bullpen late
Saturday afternoon, preserving Roger Clemens' peace to warm up.
</P>
<P>
   Those measures were as successful as they were misplaced. For no
one would protect Clemens from Boston's angry Red Sox, an oversight
that by the third inning made corned bee hash of the most
anticipated game in this town in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   After savaging the Yankees 13-1 in Game 3 behind Pedro
Martinez's 12-strikeout performance, the Red Sox can even the ALCS
tonight against New York's wobbly Andy Pettitte. The loss was the
worst ever absorbed by the Yankees in a postseason game, the 12-run
margin of victory an ALCS record as were Boston's 21 hits. This
series is not over, but just beginning to bubble. In 28 innings of
this series, New York has led for just four.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still down,'' said shortstop Nomar Garciaparra. ``We
have to keep playing''
</P>
<P>
   With just two singles allowed over seven innings and just one to
the last 23 batters he faced, Martinez appeared the master but
confessed later to having little. Still feeling the effects of of a
back strain, Martinez insisted he was able only to spot his
fastball and that his limited velocity made him far less than the
game's only 24-game winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first inning, I had the same thing I had all game _
nothing,'' said Martinez, who nevertheless extended his postseason
scoreless streak to 17 innings. ``The guys were grinding out there,
picking me up. Thank God for making me able to throw the ball
tonight. I didn't feel good at all.''
</P>
<P>
   That will do nothing for Clemens, who was hooted off the field
in the third. John Valentin, who finished with five RBIs, smacked a
two-run homer in the first off a high fastball, which had Clemens
backpedaling from the start. Nine of the 15 men he faced reached
base, four on extra-base hits. He allowed five runs on six hits and
a pair of walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Val hit the homer, you take a couple steps back and
realized you got to throw some crisper pitches,'' Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't happen. Manager Joe Torre pulled him with no one out in
the third, after a hard Mike Stanley single and a pulled foul by
rookie Brian Daubach. Fenway turned on its former hero, burying him
under an avalanche of taunts and boos. As one placard read: Roger.
``Thanks for the memories, especially this one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what I was up against,'' said Clemens, whose postseason
record dropped to 2-3 (4.04). ``Obviously, I'd love to make a
better showing than that. Everything happens for a reason. I can't
question (this).''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, Daubach and Nomar Garciaparra all homered. Hidecki
Irabu, who relieved Clemens, was pummeled even worse, tagged for
eight runs on another 13 hits. Only a Scott Brosius home run in the
eighth averted the shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Clemens) just didn't have the command that we would like to
see him have or that he would like to have,'' said Torre. ``That's
basically it. It is tough, especially in this ballpark. With our
ballclub, we just don't do well when it is a high-scoring game.
When Pedro is on the mound, it makes it that much tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Red Sox averaging 15 runs in their three home games
during the postseason, the Yankees' momentum has been effected. And
with Pettitte, a left-hander pitching in a right-handed batters
paradise, working tonight's Game 4, Fenway has changed the
complexion of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just nice to be home,'' said Garciaparra, ``to feel the
positive on your side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The score (tonight) when we start is nothing-to-nothing,''
Boston manager Jimy Williams said. ``So we start over. This is a
great game, isn't it?''

 &HT;    Rocker still rattling
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Braves manager Bobby Cox said he talked to John
Rocker about his comments against Mets fans, but the talk
apparently didn't sink in with the young reliever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with him (Friday) night before the game, but apparently
it didn't do a lot of good, because after the game I said we're
going to meet again this afternoon,'' said Cox.
</P>
<P>
   How did Rocker view the meeting with his manager?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just apologized to him for the way stuff with the fans has
gotten out of hand,'' Rocker said. ``He said he appreciated my
apology. It was maybe about a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was back at it for the media on Saturday, commenting on
how bad he thought it was that an extra 500 police officers had to
be brought into Shea Stadium for this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to play a baseball game and to have SWAT team snipers
up there, what kind of place is this?'' Rocker said. ``When wives
and girlfriends have beer spilled on them and get spit on and
they've got to have snipers, I don't know what this world is coming
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker had heard about enough from one fan at the end of batting
practice and turned to argue back with him from above the Braves
dugout. Braves GM John Schuerholz saw what was going on and asked
for security to come to the Braves dugout. As for Rocker's
comments, Schuerholz defended the closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think too much has been made of it,'' Schuerholz said. ``In
this environment, a young guy who may be vulnerable to a knee-jerk
reaction can be taken advantage of in the paper. He's a young,
excitable guy with a lot of energy. I don't think it's a big
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander made a point to stop on the top step of the
dugout after batting practice Saturday, even though New York fans
were shouting obscenities at him. Rocker pointed his glove at one
man and said, ``You can't ... beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as he walked up the ramp toward the clubhouse, a reporter
asked if he planned to tone down his antics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? It's working, ain't it,'' said Rocker. ``The only thing
I'm changing is my clothes after I get champagne all over them.''
</P>
<P>
   QUIET, BUT EFFECTIVE
</P>
<P>
   Braves reliever Mike Remlinger has conducted business more
quietly than Rocker in the series, and has proven to be equally as
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger worked through the heart of the Mets order in the
eighth inning of Game 3 and set them down in order to preserve Tom
Glavine's 1-0 lead. John Olerud lined a ball hard but right at Bret
Boone for the first out and that would be the best shot the Mets
got. Remlinger struck out Edgardo Alfonzo, the Mets' hottest hitter
this postseason, on nothing but fastballs. He then got Mike Piazza
to fly out to Brian Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' said Remlinger, who signed a two-year contract
extension with the Braves. ``My approach was the same as it's been
all year, try not to overexert.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Remlinger's first time playing in the postseason. His
first appearance was in Game 1 of the Division Series when a 2-1
Astros lead turned to 6-1 in the ninth, the most bothersome of
which was a single he gave up to Stan Javier. Since then, Remlinger
has pitched twice. He walked the leadoff man in Game 2 of the NLCS
to put Rocker in a tough position but he got out of it. Remlinger
was determined not to do the same on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a real effort before each pitch to take a second,''
Remlinger said. ``I sat there and looked down and took a deep
breath and made sure of what I wanted to do with each pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   FIRST PITCH CONTROVERSY?
</P>
<P>
   Gary Carter, a member of the Mets' 1986 world championship team,
threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 4. The former
catcher wanted to throw from behind the plate down to second, but
decided against it in light of the throwing error by Mets catcher
Mike Piazza that led to the Braves' lone run in Game 3. Instead,
Carter fired a strike from the pitcher's mound to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   CHIPPER STRUGGLES
</P>
<P>
   The postseason problems at the plate continued for Chipper
Jones. He got his first hit of the NLCS on a sharp single to left
in the fourth inning of Game 3, but got thrown out by Rickey
Henderson trying to stretch it to a double. Otherwise he struck out
twice and popped up on the infield in the first inning with runners
at first and second.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pressing,'' Braves hitting coach Don Baylor said. ``He's
missing balls he should hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who was hitting .143 (1 for 7) for the series entering
Game 4 after hitting .231 (3 for 13) in the Division Series, agrees
with the latter part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought after the hit I got last night, maybe I'd turned the
corner, but two pitchers made two pretty good pitches to get me,''
Jones said. ``It's not going to turn around in one at-bat ... I'm
not pressing. It's just a situation where I'm not swinging the bat
as well as I was three weeks ago. I feel great at the plate. I feel
like I'm on a lot of pitches, the results just haven't been
there.''

 &HT;    Fans ride wave of emotions
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The elements that make up the Mets' fans at Shea
Stadium _ energy, enthusiasm and vulgarness _ were decidedly
tempered Saturday night in Game 4 of the NLCS as compared to Game
3. They were still loud and rowdy at times, but overall their
relative calm epitomized the team's plight.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of elimination hung over the Queens structure like
a the smog over Manhattan, and the crowd was more into celebrating
something good happening rather than helping make something good
happen.
</P>
<P>
   And for a long while, there was little to cheer, only Chipper
Jones to jeer.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until first baseman John Olerud smoked a 1-1 John
Smoltz pitch in the sixth inning before the fans released unabashed
support. Olerud's home run _ a 405-foot shot over the rightfield
fence _ not only put the Mets at a 1-0 lead. It also put a charge
in their fans, who experienced a night of fluctuating emotions,
especially in the last three innings.
</P>
<P>
   With Olerud's home run, the Mets were in the lead, and the way
Rick Reed was pitching, there was optimism that their team could
live for another day. And so, they got loud. The noise level
reached a crescendo in the seventh when Reed struck out Jones to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was all the fun the Mets' fans had. The next inning, a sense
of normalcy returned to the proceedings, which means the Braves got
serious and the Mets _ and their fans _ got sad.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the feel-good quality of the night was drained from the
partisans when Brian Jordan nailed Reed's first pitch of the eighth
for a home run to left-centerfield. A stony silence fell over the
building. The expletives could be heard from every which way. And
the queasy aura of ``Here we go again'' began to surface.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the feel-good quality of the evening was
drained three pitches later, when Ryan Klesko blasted Reed's pitch
into the Mets' bullpen beyond right field. Just like that, the Mets
lead and feeling of survival was all but gone. It was 2-1, Braves.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, neither the Mets nor their fans quit. They were
desperate for a rally against cruising John Smoltz. Roger Cedeno
led off the eighth with a single up the middle, sparking a loud
roar from the crowd. Mike Remlinger recorded two outs before Cedeno
stole second.
</P>
<P>
   The fans got loud and hopeful again. Promising rookie Melvin
Mora drew a walk, bringing up Olerud. Bobby Cox countered with ace
reliever John Rocker. Cedeno and Mora stole third and second,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker then gave up his first run of the postseason when
Olerud's bouncer bounded out of Ozzie Guillen's outstretched glove
an into short center field, scoring two. The Mets led 3-2, and
after a 1-2-3 ninth, the fans _ all 55,872 _ loudly rejoiced in a
3-2 victory.

METS BEAT BRAVES, 3-2  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The hammer hung just above the Mets' heads Saturday
night, waiting ominously as Game 4 of the National League
Championship Series began to clobber them once and for all and send
them away, quietly and quickly, into the off season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had endured all manner of absurdity in the last three
weeks _ a precipitous losing streak that nearly cost them the
playoffs, a manager suggesting he should be fired and later saying
he didn't think most of his players were very smart, lineup changes
and team meetings and a mind-boggling sprint into the league
championship. But now it seemed that, in a 3-0 hole to the mighty
Atlanta Braves, a rapid conclusion to this series might almost be
merciful, a way to put the Mets out of the misery the Braves seemed
to inflict on them with almost every meeting this season.
</P>
<P>
   But John Olerud, who has been convinced for a week that the Mets
were just inches away from overtaking the Braves, would have none
of it. With two at-bats, he shoved the hammer away, driving in all
three of the Mets' runs for a thrilling 3-2 victory that, at least
for one day, keeps their gasping season breathing. The Mets have a
tremendously steep hill to climb _ they must win three in a row to
advance _ and they will attempt to continue their ascent Sunday in
Game 5, when Masato Yoshii faces the Braves' ace, Greg Maddux, who
beat the Mets in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud slugged a solo home run on a belt-high fastball from
Atlanta's starter, John Smoltz, in the sixth inning to give the
Mets a 1-0 lead. But when the Braves clubbed back-to-back home runs
off Rick Reed in the eighth inning to take a 2-1 lead, it appeared
the end would come brutally.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets, who in being shut out in Game 3 had strung
together two straight hits only once, finally broke through in the
eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno led off with a single, his third hit of the night.
Rey Ordonez tried to sacrifice, but popped his bunt up for the
first out. The left-handed-batting Matt Franco was announced as the
pinch-hitter for reliever Turk Wendell, but Atlanta Manager Bobby
Cox pulled Smoltz for the lefty Mike Remlinger. That resulted in
Mets Manager Bobby Valentine having Benny Agbayani hit for Franco.
Agbayani struck out, but then, with Melvin Mora, who had been
inserted into left field for Rickey Henderson in the top of the
inning, at the plate, Cedeno stole second. Mora walked and Cox went
for the jugular. He brought in the closer John Rocker, who barely
dodged a bottle tossed at him as he sprinted in from the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud, the only batter in the Mets' top six of the starting
lineup who had a hit, was up and he fouled off Rocker's first
pitch. The second pitch was a ball and the Mets pulled a double
steal on ball two, to put the tying and go-ahead runs in scoring
position. On the next pitch, Olerud smacked a grounder up the
middle and Ozzie Guillen, who entered the game to replace Walt
Weiss as part of the double switch that included Rocker, lunged for
it. But the ball ticked off his glove and went into center field.
As Cedeno and Mora sped home, Shea Stadium trembled with the sudden
resurgence of life.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez came in to close out the Braves in the ninth,
and the Mets, for the first time in this series, could leave the
field smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Reed had faced the minimum number of batters in what had been a
masterpiece of controlled pitching, outdueling Smoltz, one of the
finest post-season pitchers in history, and riding a 1-0 lead from
Olerud's home run.
</P>
<P>
   But in the eighth, Brian Jordan, the Braves' hottest hitter in
the post-season, smacked the first pitch from Reed over the
left-center-field wall to tie the game. Ryan Klesko came to the
plate next. He took one pitch for a ball and then belted a home run
to right field. The second game of this series, a 4-3 Braves'
victory, had turned on five pitches by Kenny Rogers. This one made
a screeching U-turn on just three pitches.
</P>
<P>
   This series has been defined by pitching _ the Braves' superb
staff sending the Mets' offense into a dismal slump, the Mets'
hurlers pitching well enough to keep every game respectable.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night was the pinnacle. While the Mets have been
tortured by their inability to produce a timely hit _ they were
shut out for 15 consecutive innings over three games _ the Braves
had managed just enough offense to keep the Mets at bay and push
them to the brink of elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz came in with a 12-3 post-season record, giving him the
most playoff victories in history, and an earned run average of
2.53.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz endured a difficult regular season, which included a
career-high nine-game strech without a victory and two stints on
the disabled list with a strained right elbow. But since turning to
a low three-quarter pitching motion in early August, Smoltz had
gone 3-3 with five no-decisions and an earned run average of 2.63
in 11 starts. In Atlanta in Game 2, he flummoxed the Mets in the
ninth inning, the first relief appearance of his major league
career.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, allowed just two hits _ both to Cedeno _ through
five innings. Cedeno led off the third inning with a full-count
single to left but was stranded on second. In the fifth, with two
out, Cedeno hit a grounder that took a bad hop in front of third
baseman Chipper Jones and bounced into left field. But Ordonez
flied out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, the Mets appeared headed to be going down quietly
again. With two out, Olerud stepped in. He was just 2 for 11
entering this game, but Olerud had remained convinced that the Mets
were just moments away from turning around their recent bad fortune
against the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played them tough,'' Olerud said after the loss in Game
3. ``We feel like we can beat them, even though we haven't been
able to get over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud finally put the Mets there. On a 1-1 count, he slammed a
belt-high fastball over the right-field fence to give the Mets a
1-0 lead, the first lead they had held since the fifth inning of
Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed was even more impressive. He, too, struggled for much
of the season, but he had success against the Braves this season,
with a 1-0 record and a 1.46 earned run average in two games before
this one.
</P>
<P>
   And his two starts prior to this one were gems, a result,
perhaps, of the fact that Reed _ after spending parts of the season
on the disabled list _ was more rested than anyone else on the
staff.
</P>
<P>
   He defeated Arizona in Game 3 of the division series, allowing
two runs on four hits in six innings, and he threw a three-hit
shutout in the next-to-last game of the regular season against the
Pirates to keep the Mets in the playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Reed allowed just one hit _ a single over the mound by Bret
Boone in the fourth inning _ through six innings last night, and he
allowed no walks in that span.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

   &UR; SCORPION TONGUES: The Irresistible History of Gossip in
American Politics &LR;  By Gail Collins. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $14.
This compendium of political gossip includes both famous rumors
from the 19th and 20th centuries and others that were long
forgotten. Not surprisingly, there's a fat chapter on the Clinton
years, pre- and post-Monica. The result is ``a breezy, timely
history,'' Wendy Kaminer wrote in The New York Times Book Review
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OPENED GROUND: Selected Poems, 1966-1996 &LR;  By Seamus Heaney.
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $15. This generous selection, which
includes works from the poet's 12 previous volumes, a few
uncollected poems and his 1995 Nobel Prize address, digs deep in
the ground of memory and is dense with the bodies of the ancient
and recent dead. Much of the verse is suffused with domestic detail
but is shadowed by the Troubles in Northern Ireland. ``Heaney has
assembled a collection with a satisfying heft and more than enough
variety of subject and style to delineate the shape of a long and
constantly evolving career,'' Edward Mendelson wrote in 1998. ``It
eloquently confirms his status as the most skillful and profound
poet writing in English today.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GRAND CENTRAL WINTER: Stories From the Street &LR;  By Lee Stringer.
Washington Square/Pocket Books, $12.95. The author is a former
crack addict and homeless man who started writing after he found a
pencil in a crawl space beneath Grand Central Terminal in New York.
His unflinching memoir gives readers ``the long view of New York's
underbelly, born of pain but delivered with style and heart,'' John
Jiler wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; SLEEPING WITH THE MAYOR: A True Story &LR;  (Hungry Mind, $15),
John Jiler chronicles New York's attempts to deal with the homeless
issue during the last decade, and his own interaction with a ragtag
group of protesters camped in City Hall Park during the
administration of Mayor Edward Koch. He ``offers a persuasive
portrait not only of a tough problem but of the larger society
surrounding it,'' Joyce Purnick wrote in 1997. ``He humanizes, but
refuses to romanticize, the characters he came to know.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION &LR;  By Gore Vidal. Harvest/Harcourt
Brace, $13. This novel about a young science prodigy summoned to
the Smithsonian to help a coven of physicists tinker with nuclear
fission and the space-time continuum is really an excuse to play
with the what-ifs of American history. Last year the reviewer
Christopher Benfey praised Vidal's ``eye for the freaks and foibles
of Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HERSELF SURPRISED &LR;  By Joyce Cary. New York Review, $12.95. The
robust heroine of this English novel, the first of a trilogy being
reissued by the publisher, is Sara Monday, a former housekeeper who
marries a rich gentleman and eventually winds up in prison. She is
``warm and real, and twice as natural as most women in fiction,''
Helen B. Parker wrote in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TO BE A PILGRIM &LR;  ($14.95) is narrated by one of Sara's lovers,
a pious, tight-fisted lawyer who reflects on his long life and lost
opportunities as he approaches death. In 1949 the reviewer George
D. Painter found the novel to have ``actuality like Defoe, humor
and energy like Dickens, hand-made prose and improvisation like
both these great writers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HORSE'S MOUTH &LR;  ($12.95) is the picaresque autobiography of
another of Sara's lovers, the irrepressible Gulley Jimson, a
raucous, bandy-legged artist who thumbs his nose at society in
grand style. ``Cary is a careful, even a profound, thinker'' whose
deeply moral tales are layered by the common themes of Protestant
grace and the conflict between individual freedom and authority,
Donald Barr wrote in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A MARITIME ALBUM: 100 Photographs and Their Stories &LR;  By John
Szarkowski and Richard Benson. Mariners' Museum and Yale
University, $24.95. This collection of images from 1859 to 1956 is
less a book about maritime history than a book that uses
photographs of shipyards, harbors and cockpits to fire the
imagination. The result is ``a moving testimonial to the exaltation
and apprehension of human interaction with the sea,'' W. Jeffrey
Bolster wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BIG GIRLS DON'T CRY &LR;  By Fay Weldon. Atlantic Monthly, $13. This
wry novel about a circle of women who start a feminist publishing
company in 1970s London follows their quest for happiness and asks
the question: Was the women's movement worth all the fuss? ``Though
Weldon's satirical breeziness can be infuriating, it's always
entertaining,'' Elizabeth Gleick wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KING LEOPOLD'S GHOST: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in
Colonial Africa &LR;  By Adam Hochschild. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $15.
From 1885 to 1908, King Leopold II of Belgium directed a brutal
campaign of forced labor to plunder what is now the Democratic
Republic of Congo. This account of the frenzy of murder and
profiteering _ and of the figures, white and black, who rose up
against it _ is ``a superb synoptic history of European misdemeanor
in central Africa,'' Jeremy Harding wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A LEXICON OF TERROR: Argentina and the Legacies of Torture &LR;  By
Marguerite Feitlowitz. Oxford University, $16.95. This grim book
focuses on the victims and crimes of the ``dirty war'' waged by the
military junta in Argentina. The result is ``a well-researched,
intimate and perceptive portrait'' of a nation still struggling
with its past, Tina Rosenberg wrote in 1998.

COWBOYS' LOSS TO EAGLES A VICTORY FOR NFL PARITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big mistake. My blunder. Unlike Nine-Toed Deion on those punt
returns, there will be no worthless dancing around on the issue.
Got to go north-south. Got to be manly and take the hit on this
one.
</P>
<P>
   A column from two weeks ago mentioned Super Bowl and Cowboys in
the same sentence. Job-wise, it wasn't a good week. I had also used
Rangers and runs in a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the Cowboys' visit to the lovely city of
Philadelphia, where they cheer spine injuries and boo safe landings
at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Disgraceful stuff happened in Philly, and that doesn't mean the
antics of The Vet fandom. There can be only one thing worse in the
NFL than losing to the Eagles _ well, actually, I can't think of
anything worse, except losing to Cleveland, who the Cowboys don't
play, and maybe it's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey could not be accused of being conservative, at least
with his comments, once he sized up local displeasure following the
Philly thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Philadelphia, everybody had us in the Super Bowl,'' he
said. ``After Philadelphia, everybody has us not winning another
game.''
</P>
<P>
   So...
</P>
<P>
   Finish your point, Chan. What's wrong with that assessment,
anyway?
</P>
<P>
   The problem here was not overrating the Cowboys, and then
suddenly looking dumb because of it. It's the NFL as a whole that
causes the confusion. Mediocrity is rampant from top to bottom, I
double dare you to pick this season's eventual Super Bowl winner.
Or name the quarterback of the unbeaten St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Valley Ranch, the screw-up in Philadelphia received the
spin-doctor treatment of the league being equal. How scary is that
_ the Eagles as the Cowboys' equal. But since Philly won, maybe the
teams weren't after all.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones is an elder statesman among NFL owners, and not
exactly a disciple of on-or-off-the-field parity. Remember, it was
Jones who challenged and eventually broke up the one-for-all
marketing payment plan the league had used for decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the famous words of Jerry, ``the teams that work the hardest,
and are the most creative, should benefit the most.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the football product, parity works against
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have to do, almost daily, is step back and look at it
from a league perspective,'' Jones said Friday. ``What do we need?
Entertainment. That is the bottom line for the league. And you do
have entertainment when every team can compete.''
</P>
<P>
   How does the NFL measure ``entertainment?''
</P>
<P>
   Only one way. ``The TV ratings are up this season, so that shows
we are putting the right product on the field,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Does Jerry ``really'' believe that? Of course not. But with
billions of dollars worth of network money involved, he can say it
publicly and keep a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   When asked his current opinion of the quality of play in the
NFL, Jones paused, then answered, ``well, it's interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also added, ``for me, I'd like to see the teams that work
the hardest in all areas, end up with the advantages. But we've had
a system in place for many years in the NFL which promotes the
concept of parity. What that does is challenge people like me to
earn their keep by continually trying to find ways to separate from
the others. There are six or seven clubs in the league who are
dedicated to that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Six or seven? Out of 31? If Jones is right, the vast majority
hopes to prosper as the NFL sinks to a lower level through parity.
Just hang around long enough and a club is bound to get better as
the NFL evens out in talent distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us attempting to beat the system, it's like
trying to land the 10-pound bass on a 2-pound test line,'' said
Jones. ``But I think it can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Up until last week, it appeared the Cowboys were a notch above
most NFL clubs. They do have offensive promise, which is the main
key to success in today's NFL. Being a notch above on offense can
get you to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But while remarkable upsets are part of football, the stinker in
Philadelphia left the Cowboys in a state of shock and confusion.
``Offensive promise'' amounted to 10 lousy points on the
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow night, however, comes a carbon copy of last week. It's
a road game against a Giants outfit that is offensively inept but
plays pretty good defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what happened, there's no shortage of believers out here
\RValley Ranch\S when you say the league is basically even,'' said
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   As long as TV ratings are up, that's not the indictment it
should be.

RAMS QB KURT WARNER SPINS UNLIKELY TALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kurt Warner put off a 1997 tryout with the Chicago Bears to get
married. The Bears canceled the workout when Warner's elbow swelled
up after a spider bit him during his Jamaica honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   And so he was schooling at-risk boys from an Iowa-area YMCA a
year later when another team, the St. Louis Rams, gave him the
chance to jump-start a football career losing momentum in the
million-to-one-chance known as the Arena League, where it is eight
against eight on a 50-yard field.
</P>
<P>
   Now Warner is schooling NFL defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's rags-to-riches tale is part luck, part perseverance,
and all things heartwarming. Exposed on the Rams' expansion list
last February, and then forced into a starter's role when the No. 1
quarterback went down with a season-ending knee injury in the
preseason, Warner, 28, has become the biggest celebrity in St.
Louis this side of Mark McGwire. ``Sports Illustrated'' has done a
big spread on him. David Letterman wants him as a guest. And the
Rev. Billy Graham talked about him during a crusade in St. Louis
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``How Kurt was passed over is one of the strange stories in
sports,'' said Charlie Armey, the Rams' player personnel director.
``But scouting \Rtalent\S is still a people business. It's not an
exact science. Johnny Unitas got cut five times. If it was easy,
everybody would be doing it, and nobody would pass on good
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are glad they didn't pass on Warner. With a strong arm
and uncanny accuracy, Warner has thrown for 1,217 yards, 14
touchdowns, and three interceptions for a league-best passer rating
of 136.0. The Rams, annually one of the worst franchises in the
league, will begin play today in Atlanta as the only undefeated
team left, at 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Warner is the only quarterback in league history to throw at
least three touchdowns passes in each of his first four starts. So
with his annual salary of $254,000, Warner has become the best
bargain since the Louisiana Purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just football to me,'' Warner said last week after his
club ended a 17-game losing streak to the 49ers with a 42-20
whipping. ``I say this over and over. I've played a lot of
football. To go out and play the way I've played doesn't surprise
me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is surprising for Warner's coach, Dick Vermeil. He admits
that he isn't too sure how long Warner's hot streak will continue,
or if Warner will one day slip back into mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with him for a while,'' Vermeil said after the 49ers
game, ``and I said, `I don't know how long this can keep going,
but, boy, I'm enjoying it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil almost didn't get that chance. Warner had been signed to
a free-agent contract by the Green Bay Packers in 1994 after
leading the Gateway Conference in passing efficiency and total
yards in his only year as a starter while a senior at Northern Iowa
the previous fall. The Packers, though, already had Brett Favre,
Mark Brunell and Ty Detmer. They released Warner in training camp
and he retreated to his Cedar Falls, Iowa, home and worked nights
at a local grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   To drum up interest for himself, he staged his own workouts for
scouts, but neither the NFL nor the Canadian Football League would
bite. So Warner took his talents to the Arena League's Iowa
Barnstormers, where he passed for 10,164 yards and 183 touchdowns
from 1995-97 and earned $65,000 during his best season.
</P>
<P>
   Armey and the Rams found Warner when Al Luginbill, coach of the
Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe, wanted an NFL team to sponsor
Warner for a job overseas. Luginbill had heard of Warner's success
in the Arena League. In 1998, after working out for Armey and
Vermeil, the Rams gave Warner a minimum wage NFL free-agent
contract and he was sent to Amsterdam. He promptly went out and led
NFL Europe in passing yards and touchdown passes in 1998. He
reported to the Rams' training camp that summer and barely beat out
journeyman Will Furrer for the third-string job behind Tony Banks
and Steve Bono.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Vermeil wanted to keep Furrer at first because Furrer
knew the system,'' Armey said. ``I pushed hard on keeping Kurt
because I really liked him. The defensive coaches _ and that's the
thing about Dick, he let's everybody have input _ also liked Kurt.
Everybody felt so strongly about him that Dick decided to keep Kurt
Warner instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner appeared in just one game in 1998, completing four passes
for 39 yards against San Francisco in the regular-season finale.
Still unsure of Warner's talents, Vermeil made him available to the
Cleveland Browns for the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Browns were going to draft a No. 1 quarterback and it
would have been very hard for them to bring in a 28-year-old free
agent,'' Vermeil claims. ``Now, we would have looked like fools if
they had taken him.''
</P>
<P>
   For once, the joke wasn't on the Rams. When Trent Green tore up
his knee in the next-to-last preseason game, Vermeil, who had
traded Banks and did not re-sign Bono, made Warner his starting
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``From his workouts, you knew he had talent,'' Armey said. ``But
no one could answer the story of whether he could play with poise
or manage a football team. Well, he's answered those questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphatically.

TEXAN GREG RAY CAPTURES POLE TO ENHANCE TITLE QUEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A points race that started with six was
reduced by half during qualifying for the Mall.com 500 yesterday.
And the driver who emerged with the pole in search of his first
Indy Racing League championship was happy to recite the updated
math.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is three points,'' said Texan Greg Ray, after qualifying
No. 1 at an event-record 216.107 mph. ``There's no telling how the
race is going to play itself out. Every single point is crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Forced to qualify with his race engine after blowing three
powerplants during practice, Ray increased his points total to 258.
He leads reigning series champion Kenny Brack by 16 and third-place
Sam Schmidt by 33 heading into 500 kilometers/312 miles/208 laps
around Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled all weekend long,'' said Ray, 33, of Plano. ``We
had motor problems and never found ourselves in a rhythm. We went
to our old notes and said we can either give up or dig down deep.
Even though we're not in Las Vegas, we picked up the biggest pair
of dice we could find and threw 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   With 52 points available under the league's point system today,
Ray, Brack and Schmidt are the only drivers eligible to win the Pep
Boys Million, a $1 million bonus split evenly between the
championship driver and his car owner.
</P>
<P>
   Six points were available during qualifying around the 1.5-mile,
high-banked quadoval. Mark Dismore, the pole sitter here in June,
qualified second at 216.071 mph in the No. 28 MCI WorldCom
Dallara/Aurora to earn two points.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Goodyear, who began the day fifth in points, earned one
marker for qualifying third at 216.036 mph. But not even that could
keep Goodyear's No. 4 Pennzoil Panther G Force/Aurora alive during
a session that also eliminated Scott Sharp and Buddy Lazier from
contention.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, winner of the most-recent race at Las Vegas Motor
Speedway on Sept. 26, qualified fourth at 215.662 mph. He and
Goodyear will occupy Row 2 when the green flag falls shortly after
1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Brack, the reigning Indianapolis 500 champion, will start fifth
after a lap at 214.593 mph in his quest to become the league's
first back-to-back champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very happy yesterday \RFriday\S with the handling of the
race car. I'm ecstatic over qualifying,'' said Ray, who earned his
series-leading fourth pole by 0.004-seconds in the No. 2
Glidden-Menards Dallara/Aurora on Firestone Firehawk tires. ``We
have both our barrels loaded, and we'll go for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scenarios are endless _ they go on and on and on. I'm not
going to dwell on that. If you do, your heart starts going a
mile-a-minute. I have to go out there and be happy in the race car.
We need a good, solid race.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack would love to do likewise in what could be his final
appearance in the No. 14 Power Team G Force/Aurora owned by A.J.
Foyt of Houston. Brack reportedly has signed to drive for Bobby
Rahal in the rival Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series
beginning in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Brack's two-lap session featured a moment when he put the
left-side tires onto the infield grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, in qualifying, you do whatever you can to get the
fastest way around the track,'' said Brack, who finished second at
Las Vegas after switching from the Dallara to G Force chassis on
Goodyear Eagle tires. ``The car felt good, so we just have to do
the best we can to try and win the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, who had his Elvis Presley-style sideburns shaved for
charity yesterday, indicated he will not be so gracious today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not anything conservative about our race approach,''
said Schmidt, driver of the No. 99 Sprint PCS-Mall.com G
Force/Aurora. ``We've got a good race setup, and I'm looking
forward to being a major factor in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who wants to give team owner John Menard his second IRL
championship in three years, said he also was ready to stand on it
before his hometown fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt very seriously you're going to hear anybody from my
pits say, `Slow down,' '' Ray said. ``If I get in a rhythm, they
all know it's better to leave me in it.''

DALLAS BURN PUTS DOWN CHICAGO FIRE IN MLS PLAYOFF OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The record alone between the Burn and the Chicago Fire
_ 2-2 this season, including three games decided by a shootout _
promised a tight battle in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's first game in the best-of-three Major Soccer League
Western Conference semifinals series more than held up to that
assessment, as No. 2 Dallas held on for a foul-ridden 2-1 victory
against No. 3 seed Chicago on goals from forward Ariel Graziani and
midfielder Mark Santel.
</P>
<P>
   Home-field advantage shifts to Chicago on Saturday, with Game 2
scheduled at 7 p.m. at Soldier Field. But the Burn seemed to have
gathered further momentum from their current hot streak, extending
their winning stretch to six consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge,'' Burn forward Jason Kreis said. ``There's no way
to say how important the first game in the playoffs is. \RYou
lose\S and your backs are up against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fire _ the defending Major League Soccer champion in the
team's first year of play _ entered the game with a 5-0 postseason
record and seemed adamant about keeping that mark perfect. A 79th
minute goal from midfielder John Ball cut the lead to 2-1, but
Chicago's constant press came up short on several more late-game
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Exciting as it was for the 10,980 fans at the Cotton Bowl, Burn
coach Dave Dir would have liked his team capitalize better on its
own chances, especially two late-game plays that appeared to have
been sure goals if not for hesitation from Graziani on one and
Jorge Rodriguez on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to have the win and beating Chicago is a good
start,'' Dir said. ``But I felt we could have played better. We can
play a lot better as far as putting the game away.''
</P>
<P>
   The two teams battled to a 0-0 draw at halftime. The Burn had
the crossbar to thank in the 10th minute, as a hard-struck blast
from Chicago midfielder Paul Dougherty was inches away from giving
the Fire an early lead.
</P>
<P>
   The level of intensity rose dramatically after intermission, and
by the end of the game, a combined 29 fouls had been called. Plenty
more pushing and shoving went uncalled, as both teams seemed to be
sending a message about the level of physical play yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani, who along with Kreis was marked closely all game,
broke the tie in the 52nd minute. He appeared to have made a bad
judgment call by dishing to Oscar Pareja in scoring range when a
shot seemed the logical choice. But Pareja immediately passed back
to a streaking Graziani, who easily put home the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was definitely some extracurricular activity going on
between me and their defense,'' Graziani said through a translator.
``But the important thing was keeping a level head and thinking
about the game and soccer. I was just there at the right time to
get the ball in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziani also collected an assist on Santel's goal, giving him
two goals and two assists in two games against Chicago.
 &LR; subheds:Briefly Burn goalkeeper Matt Jordan was selected tough
defender of the year for the Burn, finishing his first year as a
starter with a Burn-record low 1.08 goals-against average and a
league-high 11 shutouts in the regular season. Kreis, who finished
the season as the league's scoring champion with 18 goals and 15
assists, was selected the team's most valuable player and scoring
champion. Chicago defender Francis Okaroh, who got into a shoving
match early with Graziani, left the game early in the first half
with a pulled groin muscle. He is listed as questionable for the
remaining games.

FRESHMAN RUNNING BACK IGNITES TEXAS TECH PAST COLORADO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ Texas Tech found a simple solution for most
everything that ailed on a bright, brisk afternoon that foretold
the end of summer on the South Plains
</P>
<P>
   Give the ball to Shaud Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect a lot out of Shaud,'' quarterback Rob Peters said.
``He delivered today.''
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive rookie running back delivered a school
freshman-record 230 yards rushing on 21 carries and scored two
touchdowns to lead the Red Raiders to a 31-10 victory against
Colorado. Tech's homecoming victory before a Jones Stadium crowd of
46,242 brought the up-and-down Raiders record back even at 3-3 and
bumped them to 2-1 in the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the team you saw today is the team that will finish
the season,'' Williams said. ``We're tired of coming out and
playing good one game and then playing like we did at Oklahoma
State \Ra 41-21 loss\S.''
</P>
<P>
   If the 5-foot-7, 175-pound freshman runs like he did yesterday,
the schizoid Raiders might be able to stay competitive in the
tightly-bunched South Division. By accounting for exactly half of
Tech's offense yesterday, Williams more than doubled his season
output. At kickoff, he had gained 218 yards on 37 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about what Shaud was able to do,'' said
fullback Sammy Morris, whose lead blocks were key to Williams'
production. ``It's amazing to see him hit full speed in two steps.
He was just blowing by them today.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' 61-yard run on a draw play in the second quarter
kick-started a Raiders offense that produced only 34 first-quarter
yards and had to that point in coach Spike Dykes' estimation looked
like ``buzzard puke.'' Williams' scamper down the left sideline led
to Tech's initial touchdown, a 13-yard pass from Rob Peters to
split end Darrell Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had them sold on the pass,'' Williams said. ``I got a great
block from Sammy, and it split like the Red Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado threatened to get back into the game early in the
second half by capitalizing on a Tech fumble. Mike Moschetti threw
a 37-yard touchdown pass to John Minardi to make the score 17-7
with less than a minute into the half.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Raiders' ensuing possession, Williams struck again
with a 66-yard dash, moving the ball from the Tech 20 to the
Colorado 14.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays after Williams' run, Peters and Jones combined on
another 13-yard scoring play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a delay,'' Williams said. ``I cut outside off another
great block from Sammy and hit the sideline and that was about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   have been Williams' biggest run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real important that we scored there,'' Williams said.
``Because for a moment, they had taken away the momentum from us.
The fact that we took the momentum back from them right there was
the difference in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ] Williams scored Tech's second touchdown by following Morris'
lead block into the end zone from 3 yards. The touchdown was set up
by a 23-yard pass from Peters to Tim Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Williams scored his fifth touchdown of the season on a 6-yard
sweep. Williams gained 66 yards on the drive, including 46 on two
carries, as Tech again fought back the Buffaloes, who got to 24-10
on Jeremy Aldrich's 45-yard field goal three minutes into the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Williams stunned the Buffaloes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All week long we thought Sammy Morris was going to be the
guy,'' Colorado linebacker Ty Gregorak said. ``They changed up
their offense in that respect. It was really weird to see another
Williams \Rrather than the injured Ricky\S back there. \RShaud\S is
going to be a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech also reversed a season turnover trend by benefiting from
four fumble recoveries and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense made big play after big play,'' Dykes said. ``This
is the kind of thing that used to happen all the time. And we
really forced some of those turnovers today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really proud of the way we responded after last week. No
excuses, but we are really hurting in some areas without /Rtight
end/fullback/S Kyle Allamon, \Rreceiver\S Derek Dorris and Ricky
Williams. I don't know why some people think that just because you
lose a game, these kids are going to quit. We may stink it up, but
we're not going to quit.''

INDY-CAR CREW CHIEF CHEATS DEATH AND COMES BACK TO RACING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When Robbie McGehee saw Steve Fried at a
racetrack for the first time in three months, the first thing
McGehee noticed was Fried's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``His hands were clean,'' said McGehee, a rookie on the Indy
Racing League circuit. ``The thing I remember most about Steve was
that no matter how many times he washed his hands they were just
dirty and greasy. And he said he Could not wait to get them greasy
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's the little things that people remember about a
person. But most remember Fried, McGehee's crew chief, as part of a
horrifying accident on pit road in late May at the Indianapolis
500.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought Fried would not survive the accident]. But by late
August at Pikes Peak International Raceway in Fountain, Colo.,
Fried had returned to the racetrack as a spectator. Then last month
at Las Vegas, he was back working on the Dale Conti-engineered cars
driven by McGehee.
</P>
<P>
   After a long, sometimes painful summer for Fried, he still has a
sense of humor but knows that someone was watching out for him that
day in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I wake up, and I know I should not be here,'' said
Fried, whose middle name is Lazarus. ``I am so lucky. With all the
best of care that I had, I still should not be here. Somebody up
there was watching over me that is for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The events of May 30 will forever be ingrained in the minds of
Conti, McGehee and Fried's wife, Jennifer.
</P>
<P>
   McGehee started well back in the 33-car field, and Conti told
him to pit during an early caution. McGehee stalled the car during
the pit stop and was bumped from behind by Jimmy Kite while
McGehee's crew] were restarting the car.
</P>
<P>
   After the bump, Kite's front tire slammed into Fried and flipped
him into the air. Fried landed head first on the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the back of my mind I am thinking that is the last time I
am going to see Steve,'' Conti said. ``That was an unsurvivable
incident. Everyone was just stunned. But actually, it was the best
facility in the world for it to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fried was transported to Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis.
Shortly after he reached the hospitalthe doctors on duty thought
Fried would not survive. But Jennifer refused to believe that;
Fried was an accomplished swimmer on a team near their Ohio home,
and she said she knew his heart and lungs were strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the doctors if anybody could survive it he can survive
it because he is in the best physical shape of anybody in this
hospital,'' Jennifer said.
</P>
<P>
   And he did. During a tenuous few weeks, Fried's condition
steadily improved. Some of his injuries included paralysis on the
right side of his face, problems with double vision and a broken
collarbone that required surgery to repair.
</P>
<P>
   Fried said the double vision has improved _ he no longer wears
an eye patch _ and doctors have told him that it may take anywhere
from six months to a year for the paralysis to heal. But he will
not be required to have surgery on his face, something his doctors
thought would be needed to fix the paralysis. He said surgery to
remove a portion of collarbone at the end of July set his recovery
back a bit, but he was still able to swim, albeit with one arm,
shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month after the surgery I asked \Ra doctor\S if I could
start swimming again, and he said absolutely not,'' Fried said. ``I
said I could swim with my right arm, and he said you can't do that;
you'll go around in circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left his office and I went and got my suit. I went to a pool
and swam with one arm that day. I swam for about a month with one
arm and I am now slowly beginning to use both arms.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that determination that amazes Conti and McGehee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest fear was brain injury, and I figured this could be
a three-year recovery deal,'' Conti said. ``I don't know when it
was, but the first time he could actually talk, they had him
sedated pretty well, and he gave his thumbs up. I knew his brain
was not injured because he was himself.''
</P>
<P>
   He made his return to Conti's shop about a month after the
accident and started working shortly after the race at Pikes Peak
in August. And with each race his role has increased, with Mike
Buscher handling most of the crew-chief duties after his accident.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Fried will attempt to go ``over the wall'' for the first
time since his accident. He will work with the team during morning
practices as a front-tire changer. He will make his decision on
whether to continue that duty after those practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been playing with some tires, and I would like to get
back over the wall again,'' he said. ``But I am going to have to
feel that I am absolutely 100 percent for doing the job. If Robbie
did not get rookie of the year because of something I did, I would
never forgive myself. If there is a feeling that I am not 100
percent, I am not going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   His presence at the track may be enough to propel McGehee to the
rookie title.

PEOPLE THRONG TO MANHATTAN CHURCH AS RELICS OF `THE LITTLE FLOWER'
ARRIVE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The relics of St. Therese of Lisieux, the Emily
Dickinson of Roman Catholic sainthood, arrived Saturday at Our Lady
of the Scapular Church on East 28th Street to begin a four-day stay
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   They are on a world-encircling tour of Europe, Russia, Brazil
and Argentina and dozens of cities in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, at 4:30 p.m., the relics are to be brought to St.
Patrick's Cathedral. Later in the week, they will be taken to
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   As the plexiglass-covered box of polished jacaranda wood, carved
roses and filigreed silver was removed from a black van dubbed the
Therese-mobile and carried up the steps of the church, the crowds
filling the residential street applauded vigorously. They craned
their necks to see. A few wept. Many carried a red rose _ St.
Therese is called The Little Flower and roses are her signature.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pomp of the reception _ the berobed priests, the
Knights of Columbus in bushy headdresses, the little girls in white
dresses spreading rose petals before the procession _ people spoke
of St. Therese with familiarity, like an especially close family
member and trusted confidante who had unexpectedly become famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's there for me,'' said Anne Schaentzler, 49, a supervisor
at a brokerage company. ``The other great saints and mystics _ I
could never live up to that. She's like me _ plain, ordinary. She's
there when I need her. And since she hasn't said she's gotten tired
of hearing from me, I'll keep talking to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Volpe, a computer network administrator, and his wife,
Christine, brought their four children from Copiague, N.Y. ``I want
them to see that being a saint is real,'' he said. ``Sometimes
saints seem so far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the uneventful, confined life of St. Therese, a
Carmelite nun who died of tuberculosis in 1897, at the age of 24,
clearly has inspired far more affection and devotion among many
faithful Catholics than the heroics of martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   ``She lived a quiet little life in her convent,'' said the Rev.
Robert Colaresi, director of the Society of the Little Flower in
Darien, Ill., one of the organizers of the tour. ``But she was a
bright light ahead of her time. She believed in a God of love and
thought she should just do simple things with love. Period. If she
had to attend to a cranky nun, do it with a smile.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, he said, she was a ``spoiled brat.'' Her sufferings
were the common sort _ irritation, depression, frustration. She
never faced, for example, being burned at a stake. At one point in
the convent, when another nun's constant clacking noises infuriated
her, she prayed and managed to hear the annoying sounds as a
concert of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual pilgrimage of saints' relics _ in this case, small
pieces of Therese's bones retrieved from her grave during the
investigatory process that preceded her canonization in 1925 _ had
its start in 1997, when Pope John Paul II declared her a Doctor of
the Church, a promotion to a kind of super-saint. She is the
youngest of the 33 saints with the rank of Doctor in the Roman
Catholic church and one of only three women. She is, the Pope
remarked at the time, the saint for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea of venerating relics might strike some as curious or
superstitious, those crowding the church aisles Saturday seemed to
consider it natural. Two or three at a time, people kneeled in
front of the reliquary and pressed their palms or lips to the
plexiglass. Mary Iacono, a special education teacher, said it was
not bone shards that made her weep, but ``her presence _ so special
it radiates.''
</P>
<P>
   To Jo McLaughlin, 76, of Lakewood, N.J., St. Therese is
practically as accessible as a daughter. ``If I ask her for a
favor, I say, `Are you listening to me, Therese?' And if she is, I
see a blue rose.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McLaughlin's family is carrying on her tradition -- of
praying to the saint and coincidentally finding blue roses that,
for them, are signs the wish has been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Gail Cook, 35, a non-Catholic film student at
New York University, included the White Rose Bar in a film she was
making. But for some reason, she changed its name to Blue Rose Bar.
Shortly afterward, she met and married Mrs. McLaughlin's son, John.
And just the other day, she bought pajamas for their baby printed
with blue roses. ``I didn't notice,'' she said. ``But a couple of
days later, John got a good job he didn't expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Pure happenstance? Perhaps. But Ms. Cook is not taking any
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really religious,'' she said. ``But when I think of
it, I pray to St. Therese. She's someone I can relate to.''

Martinez, bats help Yankees look lopsided
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BOSTON _ Luckily, they still use a manual scoreboard at Fenway
Park.
</P>
<P>
   The rate the Boston Red Sox have been scoring runs is enough to
blow out a few bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   The most highly anticipated pitching matchup in this historic
ballpark turned into a slugfest Saturday as the Boston Red Sox
handed the New York Yankees their most lopsided loss in postseason
history 13-1 in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez, despite soreness in his back, dominated with
seven shutout innings. Roger Clemens well, he was gone before you
could say, ``Get your peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches into the game, Jose Offerman hit a triple and John
Valentin followed with a two-run homer off Clemens into the screen
above the Green Monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never let up against the Yankees,'' Boston manager Jimy
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox kept pouring it on.
</P>
<P>
   After the second inning: Boston 4, Yankees 0.
</P>
<P>
   After the third inning: Boston 6, Yankees 0.
</P>
<P>
   After the sixth inning: Boston 9, Yankees 0.
</P>
<P>
   After the seventh inning: Boston 13, Yankees 0.
</P>
<P>
   Looking nothing like the team beaten in two one-run decisions
earlier this week at Yankee Stadium, the Red Sox gave a sellout
crowd of 33,190 plenty to cheer for in cutting New York's lead in
the best-of-seven series to 2-1. Game 4 is scheduled for tonight at
Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Yankees' most lopsided in postseason play,
topping the 12-1 rout to Atlanta in Game 1 of the 1996 World
Series. New York avoided the shutout when Scott Brosius homered off
Tom Gordon in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Boston ended its 10-game ALCS losing streak, while New York had
its record-tying 12-game postseason winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez didn't need much help Saturday, setting a Boston
postseason record with 12 strikeouts. He allowed just two singles
and did not permit a runner to advance past first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an artist out there,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
``He has a baseball instead of a paint brush.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox fans harassed Clemens from the start, serenading him
with chants of ``Ro-ger, Ro-ger'' as he warmed up in the bullpen
area. It was nothing compared to the treatment he received from the
Boston batting order, which finished with an ALCS-record 21 hits,
10 for extra bases.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin homered and drove in five runs, and Nomar Garciaparra
went 4-for-5 with a home run, double and three RBIs. Eight
different Red Sox had at least two hits.
</P>
<P>
   Just six days earlier, the Red Sox set a postseason record for
runs in beating Cleveland 23-7 in Game 4 of the AL Division Series.
Boston has scored 45 runs in its last three playoff games at
Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no doubt we would shift and have a carry-over coming
back here,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   While Martinez was in control, Clemens' postseason struggles
continued as he dropped to 2-3 lifetime in 11 career starts.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up a two-run homer to Valentin in the first inning,
Trot Nixon doubled, Jose Offerman singled and Valentin drove in his
third run of the game with an infield grounder. By then, the
Yankees had Hideki Irabu warming up in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Following a walk to Jason Varitek, Garciaparra doubled into the
left-field corner for a 4-0 lead. Stanley singled in the third and
Clemens was pulled after one pitch to Brian Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach sent Irabu's fourth pitch over the right-field fence for
a 6-0 lead. Clemens was charged with five runs, six hits and two
walks in two-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what I was up against. I'm disappointed,'' said
Clemens, who pitched for the Red Sox from 1984-96. ``Obviously, I
hoped for a better performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't continue to give up runs and have a chance when
you're facing Pedro. I felt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing it was nothing personal against Clemens, the Red Sox
continued their punishment against Irabu. They added two more runs
in the fifth, one in the sixth and four in the seventh, highlighted
by a two-run homer by Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu's line: eight runs and 13 hits in 4 innings.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the crowd began with a chorus of, ``Where's Roger?''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who would later admit not having his best fastball,
instead relied on a mix of off-speed pitches to puzzle the Yankees.
He struck out Tino Martinez, Chili Davis and Ricky Ledee on 15
pitches in the second and fanned seven of nine batters during one
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who was forced to leave Game 1 of the Division Series
against Cleveland because of a strained muscle in the shoulder area
but came back to pitch six hitless innings in the clinching Game 5,
has not allowed a run in 17 consecutive postseason innings.
</P>
<P>
   The margin of victory helped ease the pain Martinez felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hurting. I'm hurting on every pitch I throw,'' he said.
``But I managed to do it somehow.''
