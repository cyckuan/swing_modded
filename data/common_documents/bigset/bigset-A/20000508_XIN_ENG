<HEADLINE> Iraq Appreciates Stand of Arab Parliamentary Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq appreciates the stand of the
visiting Arab parliamentary delegation which is against the decade-
long U.N. sanctions on Iraq, said Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq
Aziz while meeting the delegation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Aziz expressed his appreciation of the
delegation's stand against the "unjust" embargo and his gratitude
for its solidarity with the Iraqi people, the official Iraqi News
Agency(INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which arrived in the Iraqi capital Baghdad on
Sunday evening, appealed to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan for
an immediate lifting of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also acquainted the delegation of Iraq's position on the U.
N. Security Council Resolution 1284, describing it as one that
neither fulfills Iraq's legitimate rights, nor leads to the lifting
of the embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz is just one of the senior Iraqi leaders who have repeatedly
rejected the U.N. resolution, which created a new arms inspection
body, the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Arab parliamentary delegation, Sheikh Al-Zanati,
along with other delegation members, expressed their rejection of
the continued embargo and their solidarity with the Iraqi
government and people, said the INA.
</P>
<P>
They asserted that they are trying to convey a message to the
Iraqi people that Arab nations stands with Iraq against the
embargo, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab parliamentary delegation groups parliamentary
representatives from nine Arab countries that include Morocco,
Yemen, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Algeria, Libya, Egypt and Tunis.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is headed by Sheikh Al-Zanati, secretary-general
of the Libyan People's Congress (parliament).

<HEADLINE> No Change in Venue for Cyprus Talks: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government spokesman Michalis
Papapetrou said here on Monday that so far there is no issue of
changing the venue for the third round of Cyprus talks and that
what is pending is the time for holding the talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, now hospitalized after
undergoing an operation last Friday to remove a polyp from his
large intestine, was originally scheduled to meet with Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on May 23 in New York.
</P>
<P>
Due to Clerides' poor health, the spokesman recommended at a
press conference a few days' patience until doctors are in a
position to say when Clerides will be able to travel.
</P>
<P>
According to the doctors treating the 81-year-old president, his
recovery is "excellent," but he will not be in a position to travel
in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of hosting the third round of talks
in Nicosia instead of New York, Papapetrou said "the government is
not aware of any such discussion," adding, however, that if the
issue is raised in the future, it will be considered.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed suggestions about a possible replacement of the
president at the talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern part of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup in
Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash have held two rounds of proximity talks,
under U.N. auspices, in an effort to prepare the ground for
substantive talks which may lead to a comprehensive settlement of
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the third round of talks will start on May 23
in New York.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Cypriot Politicians Meet in Buffer Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Leaders or representatives of Greek
Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot political parties met in the U.N.-
controlled buffer zone in Nicosia over issues concerning contact
between the two communities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, General Secretary of Greek Cypriot
left-wing AKEL party Demetris Christofias said political party
leaders of the two communities decided that such meetings will be
held once a month.
</P>
<P>
He added that party leaders "concentrated their attention on the
issue of contact and trust among people of the two communities,"
which he described as "positive and somehow promising."
</P>
<P>
On his part, the leader of the Turkish Cypriot Democratic Party,
Serdar Denktash, referring to the two rounds of the U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks between Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, claimed that the Turkish
Cypriot side has acted "in a very constructive manner."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his backing for talks in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot political
parties was organized by the Slovak Embassy in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting has been set for June 6 to discuss "practical
measures of rapprochement," said a joint communique issued at the
end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Evacuates 266 Civilian Staff from Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday authorized the evacuation of 266 U.N. civilian staff
from Sierra Leone, where tensions between U.N. peacekeepers and
rebels remain high, U.N. officials announced.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 U.N. peacekeepers are missing or have been taken
hostage by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF). On Monday,
at least four people were reported dead in a shootout around the
home of the RUF leader, Foday Sankoh, in the nation's capital of
Freetown. The U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, blamed on RUF fighters
firing at demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Annan called on the Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) and its leader "to cease immediately any hostile action,"
and appealed to the leaders of the region to "re-double their
efforts to bring the situation under control and restore normalcy"
in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued here by his spokesman, said, Annan "once
again urges the RUF and its leader, Mr. Foday Sankoh, to cease
immediately any hostile action" in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The statement came amid reports of continuing military movement
by the RUF and shooting in Freetown, capital of the West African
country.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is "extremely concerned about the rapidly
deteriorating situation in Sierra Leone," called on "all parties
to do their utmost to defuse the situation," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General has appealed to the leaders of the
region to re-double their efforts to bring the situation under
control and restore normalcy," the statement said. "He also calls
on the Governments of neighboring States to do everything possible
to prevent the reported movement of rebels from the territory of
their countries to Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
"In the circumstances, the Secretary-General continues to
stress that, in addition to U.N. efforts, a rapid reaction force
may be needed in Sierra Leone as soon as possible to assist in
restoring conditions conducive to the resumption of the peace
process," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said there were unconfirmed reports of rebels moving
to Guinea and Liberia, which had supported them during the Sierra
Leone's eight-year-old civil war that was to have ended last
summer with a power-sharing agreement, known as the Lome Peace
Agreement signed in July last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that leaders from four West African countries -- Mali,
Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea -- were meeting Monday in the
Guinean capital of Conakry, along with the U.N. special
representative in Sierra Leone, Oluyemi Adeniji of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo plans a meeting in Abuja,
the Nigerian capital, Tuesday that may include nine West African
nations.
</P>
<P>
The capture of 500 U.N. peacekeepers began last Monday in
small groups. In addition to 400 Zambians, those taken hostage are
from India, Kenya and Nigeria. One Kenyan has been killed and
another is missing.

BOGOTA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A bomb-car explosion and a rebel
attack on a bus in Colombia left 9 dead and 6 wounded, authorities
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Three civilians died in the explosion of a bomb-car at Cerrito,

<P>
At the town of Gigante, in the province of Huila, south of
Colombia, a rebellious group attacked a bus leaving six dead and
six wounded.
</P>
<P>
The police blamed the guerrilla group Revolutionary Armed

the negative of the company owning the bus to pay the so-called "
revolutionary tax" to the rebel organization.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Still Confident of Israeli-Palestinian Framework Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said on
Monday that he was still confident of a framework agreement to be
reached between Israel and the Palestinians despite possible slip
away of the targeted date of mid-May the two sides set for that
deal.
</P>
<P>
"I think we will get a framework agreement," Clinton told
reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe not by the deadline, but they thought they might trip
the deadline a little bit," he said. "But I think we'll get an
agreement, an overall agreement, by September."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed to
reach a framework agreement in mid-May to pave the way for a final
agreement by September 13.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians opened this year's third round of
talks on April 30 in the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat, the
first two rounds were held in Washington. But the talks again
balked as the two sides could not narrow the gaps between them.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said the two sides differed over the pace
of transferring to Palestinian rule three villages near Jerusalem.
They said any delays would jeopardize the September deadline.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat met for the first time since mid-March to
try to revive the stalked talks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said there were substantial gaps existing between the
two sides, "but if they want to do it bad enough, they'll do it."

<HEADLINE> Possible Interest Rates Hike Causes Nervousness in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Letters of National Treasury,
prefixed bonds, will be auctioned off Tuesday by Central Bank of
Brazil, in midst of a nervousness due to predictions of an
increase of interest rates in the United States.
</P>
<P>
In the last four auctions of letters, interests jumped from 18.
28 percent to 20.31 percent. And the result of this auctioning
will prove existing expectations with regard to Brazil's economy.
</P>
<P>
Besides, interests to be defined will also indicate influence
in Brazil of the current instability of America's economy,
according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Indications of Brazil's economy are good up to date. In April,
inflation in Sao Paulo was 0.09 percent, very inferior to what
experts had expected. Public deficit is under control, tax taking
were at a record, the trade balance is in equilibrium and
expectations are the country will receive close to 30 million
dollars in foreign investments this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Brazil's financial market is nervous and fears the
rise in interest rates in United States, which is already placing
pressure on rates in Brazil.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Says 85 Million Newborns Protected From Iodine Deficiency Every Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Salt iodization protects 85
million new-borns every year from a ten percent loss in learning
ability, the United Nations Children's Fund(UNICEF) said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of Salt 2000, the 8th World
Salt Symposium held in The Hague, Carol Bellamy, Executive
Director of UNICEF said "This is a tremendous accomplishment. It
means that children are smarter. It means that they are finishing
school. It means that a world of new opportunities is open to them.
"
</P>
<P>
Iodine deficiency affects intelligence and the ability to learn.
It is the world's single greatest cause of preventable severe
mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
"Where population are suffering from iodine deficiency, average
intelligence can spiral downwards by approximately ten IQ points,"
Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
"This has serious implications, not only for individuals, but
also for the social and economic development of entire nations,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy told the meeting that two major tasks remain to be
accomplished: The first is to reach the 30 percent of the world's
population that does not have access to iodized salt. The second
is to sustain the progress already achieved.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy called on the salt industry to support implementation
of the iodization legislation -- now on the books in many
countries.
</P>
<P>
She urged all producers to help improve the production,
quality and availability of iodized salt in the developing world,
through such initiatives as encouraging salt production in
developing countries.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has intensified its efforts in
 search for more than 200 soldiers who have been taken hostage by
Sierra Leone rebels.
</P>
<P>
Defence Minister Chitalu Sampa said in an interview here on
Monday that he could not comment on the latest situation in
Sierra Leone concerning the Zambian soldiers because the
government had not yet received any fresh information on that.

<P>
"We have not received any fresh information from that country

out what the situation is," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sampa confirmed Sunday night in a national broadcast both on
television and radio that more than 300 U.N. troops including
those from Zambia are being held by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian troops were dispatched to re-enforce the Kenyan
peacekeepers who were reported to have been engaged with the
rebels at a place called Makeni on May 3, where they were
surrounded, outnumbered and captured, he said.

<HEADLINE> One More White Farmer Killed in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean police Monday confirmed
the death of a Beatrice commercial farmer who was attacked at his
farm by about five assailants on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman, Chief Superintendent Wayne Bvudzijena said
that the farmer, 47 years old, was identified as Dan Alan Stuart
of Maasplein farm.
</P>
<P>
Police investigations are continuing, he said, refusing to give
 immediate comment on the motive of the attack.
</P>
<P>
A security guard at the farm told the Zimbabwe News Agency that
Stuart was attacked by about six men using timber bricks and
chairs to batter his head.
</P>
<P>
The death of Stuart brings to three the number of white
commercial farmers killed since last month.
</P>
<P>
The other two commercial farmers, David Stevens of Macheke and
Martin Olds of Nyamandlovu, were killed last month by suspected
war veterans during farm invasions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ugandan, Rwandan Presidents to Meet on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
reaffirmed on Monday that he will meet his Rwandan counterpart
Paul Kagame on Sunday at a location to be agreed on.
</P>
<P>
Museveni told the press after a meeting with a U.N. Security
Council delegation headed by U.S. Representative to U.N. Richard
Holbrooke that he and Kagame have agreed to establish contact.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came two days after a one-day clash between Ugandan
and Rwandan troops at Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) which broke out last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda had been close allies in the DRC conflict.
Tensions between the two countries have steadily increased since
March 1999 when they are embarked on backing rival rebel forces in
the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Museveni assured the region and the international community
that what happened in Kisangani should not derail the efforts of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke told the press after the meeting that he had come to
meet Museveni to seek his advice and views on how to proceed on
the deployment of a U.N. peace keeping force in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The discussions were centered on the implementation of the
Lusaka cease- fire agreement signed by all belligerents in last
July, on how the United Nations can effect emergency deployment in
the DRC and on the recent clashes in Kisangani, he said.
</P>
<P>
Constant telephone contact was maintained with Kigali during
Monday's meeting, Holbrooke said, adding that the Ugandan and
Rwandan leaders have agreed to jointly solve the problem of
Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the most urgent activity of the U.N. Security
Council in the DRC is to ensure that an emergency force is in
place in that country as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Host Emergency Mini-Summit on S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- An emergency Mini-Summit of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) on Sierra Leone
is scheduled to be held in Nigeria's capital Abuja on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The summit will discuss ways and means to consolidate the Lome
Peace Accord following the recent violations of the peace
agreement by the rebels of the war-torn west African country, said
a press release issued by the ECOWAS Secretariat on Monday in
Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state of Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea,
Liberia, Mali, Togo, Sierra Leone and the host Nigeria are
expected to attend the summit sponsored by the ECOWAS's Joint
Implementation Committee on the Lome Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Peace Accord was signed last July by the Sierra
Leonean government led by President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and the
Revolutionary United Front led by Foday Sankoh under the auspices
of Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, who was then ECOWAS
Chairman.
</P>
<P>
The present tense situation in Sierra Leone was attributed to
the abduction of about 70 United Nations peacekeepers by the
Sankoh-led rebels in the past few days.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Blames Military Rule for Economic Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has attributed the socio-economic setbacks in the west and central
 African sub-region to the "unnecessary and incessant military
interventions" .
</P>
<P>
Opening a council meeting of the Port Management Association of
West and Central Africa in Lagos on Monday, Obasanjo, who was
represented by Minister of Transport Kema Chikwe, said it was of
no doubt that the sub- region had suffered drastic set-back as a
result of unnecessary and incessant military interventions.
</P>
<P>
"It is gratifying, however, that today, even though we are
still grappling with some problems here and there, we are
beginning to reap the fruits of democracy over military rule which
has become unfashionable and unacceptable the world over," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with globalization and trade liberalization,
governments are now de-emphasizing excessive control of the port
industry and encouraging private-sector participation and
initiative.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Amasses Troops Along Border With Rwanda: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 8 (xINHUA) -- Heavy military deployment of Uganda
People's Defense Force (UPDF) has been amassed along the
Uganda-Rwanda border, Rwanda News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Ugandan soldiers have been heavily deployed in the areas of
Kamwezi and Mirama hills, all bordering Rwanda," Major Emmanuel
Ndahiro, spokesman for the Rwandan army, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Sources from the Ugandan Presidency say that it's routine
deployment of soldiers," Ndahiro said, adding that "Uganda denies
the allegations that the intention of heavy deployment is to
attack Rwanda."
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the border, over 1,500 troops are
already deployed in Gafunzo, six kilometers from Rwanda frontier
(Kagitumba border post). More deployments in the areas of Ntungamo
moving towards the border are underway, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sources from Uganda were quoted as saying that
"movements of Ugandan troops were seen one week ago, but the
situation seems to be intensifying along Uganda-Rwanda border."
</P>
<P>
"Between six and nine battalions are already in the area", the
same sources confirmed.
</P>
<P>
"The deployment in the area is rather unusual. Rwanda has not
taken any measure but only takes note of the situation,", Ndahiro
stressed.
</P>
<P>
But sources from Umutara region (bordering Uganda) told Rwanda
News Agency that Rwanda has also reinforced troops in the border
area since last weekend.
</P>
<P>
This amassing of troops came after clashes between Uganda and
Rwandan army in Kisangani, the Democratic Republic of the Congo
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The same clashes also occurred in last year. Since then,
mistrust has been going on between the two neighboring states and
former friends.

NAIROBI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda to to carry out its national
population census starting from this August an estimated cost of 6
million U.S. dollars, Rwanda News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Donald Kaberuka, Minister of Finance and Economic
Planning who chaired the national census commission, the pilot
study will commence August this year and the preliminary results
is expected to be published August next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, "knowledge about our population is
limited, thus making it difficult for resource utilization and
planning."
</P>
<P>
The national census will to some extent establish the number
of genocide victims, the minister said, adding that a specific
study to establish the actual number of the victims will be
carried out by the Ministry of Local Government.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the success of this census will depend on the
participation of the population which must give all the required
information in collaboration with administrative authorities.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Meets U.N. Envoy on Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein met
here on Monday with visiting U.N. Secretary General's special envoy
for Middle East affairs Terje Roed-Larsen over the latest
developments of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Jordanian monarch stressed that all
parties concerned should make efforts to remove obstacles standing
in the way for a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the
region, Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
During a separate meeting with Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel
Ilah al-Khatib, Larsen said his just-concluded talks with Syrian
and Lebanese leaders are satisfactory and will create an
appropriate atmosphere for the Israeli troop withdrawal from
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Khatib reaffirmed Jordan's support for Lebanon
during the upcoming Israeli troop pullout from south Lebanon, and
stressed the kingdom is keen to see full and accurate
implementation of U.N. resolutions 425 and 426 on the Lebanon
issue.
</P>
<P>
Khatib also expressed the hope that the Israeli pullout will
contribute to improving the atmosphere for realizing a peaceful
settlement on both the Syrian and Lebanese tracks of the peace
process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the fourth leg of Larsen's five-nation tour of the
region, which has taken him to Israel, Lebanon and Syria and will
take him to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Larsen's regional tour comes at a time when it is increasingly
likely that Israel will unilaterally pull out its troops by July
from south Lebanon which it had occupied for 22 years, due to
mounting casualties among Israeli soldiers and less chances for
Israel to reach a peace deal with Syria, a major power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which resumed last December
after a hiatus of almost four years, broke off in January after two
rounds of talks in the U.S. over the return of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Syria demands for a full Israeli pullout from Golan, which it
captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war, but the demand was
rejected by the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Both Syrian and Lebanese officials hinted that any unilateral
Israeli troop withdrawal from south Lebanon will trigger
uncontrollable guerrilla attacks on Israeli soldiers and cross-
border attacks on Israeli targets.

<HEADLINE> Israel May Withdraw Earlier From South Lebanon: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel may withdraw from south
Lebanon ahead of its self-imposed July 7 deadline, Prime Minister
Ehud Barak said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Army Radio, Barak said the Israeli army
is preparing for the withdrawal from south Lebanon, but has not yet
decided when to complete it.
</P>
<P>
Asked about whether the withdrawal could take place earlier than
the target date, Barak said "By July 7 means not after and does not
rule out having it before."
</P>
<P>
In preparations for the upcoming withdrawal, the Israeli
military has begun erecting a new fence along the Israeli-Lebanese
border while military leaders have instructed various branches to
speed up preparations for the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which is
made up of 4,500 troops from nine countries, has reportedly
formulated several options on how the international peacekeeping
force can fulfill responsibilities in south Lebanon under U.N.
Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The options are primarily based on the expansion of the U.N.
forces from its present level of 4,500 troops.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has yet met to decide on this issue,
but Israel has asked it to send an international peacekeeping force
to south Lebanon to maintain security there after Israel's pullout.
</P>
<P>
Barak shared the worries expressed by Israeli military leaders
that Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah will try to step up their
attacks on Israeli soldiers ahead of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
But, Barak said anyone who tries to harm Israel will get what he
deserves, meaning Israel will retaliate.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief of General Staff Maj.-Gen. Uzi Dayan told the
Israeli television Channel 1 Sunday night that Israel's planned
withdrawal from south Lebanon can take place before the July 7
deadline set by Barak.

<HEADLINE> Arab Parliamentary Delegation Calls For Lifting of Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 8 (Xinhua) -- An Arab parliamentary delegation,
currently on a visit to Iraq, has appealed to U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan for immediate lifting of the decade-long U.N.
sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA),
Sheikh Al-Zanati, head of the delegation, said the U.N. embargo,
imposed on Iraq since August 2, 1990, is "unprecedented in the
history of international relations" and "has brought about
catastrophic consequences to the life of Iraqi population as a
whole."
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that the embargo has already resulted in
the deaths of more than one million innocent people, of whom a
majority are children, adding that Iraqi people have been subjected
to the dangers of starvation, malnutrition and other adverse impact
caused by the embargo.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the U.N., the principles of the U.N. Charter,
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as the
International Humanitarian Law, "reject outright the perpetuation
of such tragic conditions in human life in Iraq as has been brought
about by the continued embargo," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement called upon the U.N. secretary-general to exert
his utmost efforts for immediate lifting of the embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Arab parliamentary delegation, which arrived in the Iraqi
capital Baghdad on Sunday evening, groups parliamentary
representatives from nine Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was headed by Sheikh Al-Zanati, secretary-general
of the Libyan People's Congress (parliament).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Airlines in A Push for Shorter Lines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the end of the year, for instance, Continental Airlines
plans to have 300 ATM-like computers across the country that allow
people to print their own boarding passes and baggage tags.
</P>
<P>
Delta Air Lines has spent 750 million U.S. dollars over the
last two years wiring airports and preparing to introduce similar
gadgets. Northwest Airlines responds to canceled flights at its
hubs by rolling out banks of wireless phones with direct
connections to its reservation desk.
</P>
<P>
And Alaska Airlines, has begun to allow people with electronic
tickets to print boarding passes from home or office computers. It
has also scanned the driver's licenses of about 500 frequent
fliers into its computers system. The bar code on the boarding
pass retrieves both their drivers' license and a larger photo so
travelers never have to reach into their wallets before boarding
the plane.
</P>
<P>
Delta and other carriers are putting up computer screens near
gate counters in an attempt to answer easy questions, such as the
reason for a delay, that often clog up lines. Northwest's agents
in Detroit and Minneapolis are using hand-held computers to print
boarding passes for passengers waiting in long lines.
</P>
<P>
The initiative that is the furthest along is the installation
of the ticket kiosks that print boarding passes. Alaska,
Continental and Northwest have put them in dozens of airports.
Delta has installed them in Boston, New York and Washington for
shuttle flights, and United is now testing a version in Aspen,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
Airline executives say they have not cut any jobs because of
the machines but likely would have had to hire more agents without
the kiosks.
</P>
<P>
For now, there is rarely a line, and almost never a long one,
at the kiosks. Mary Anne Smith of Metuchen, A New Jersey passenger
told The New York Times that she used one of them last week at
Newark International Airport before boarding a Continental flight
on a business trip. "They're quicker even than when there are no
lines" at the counters, she said. "I don't have to talk to anyone.
"
</P>
<P>
They are mainly useful, however, for passengers who have no
bags to check and no questions to ask.
</P>
<P>
Only Alaska, in Anchorage and Portland, now permits passengers
to print their own tags and then drop them onto a conveyer belt
from which the luggage is X-rayed and put on the plane.

<HEADLINE> Six Killed When Air Conditioner Recycles Carbon Monoxide in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed when an
air conditioner absorbed carbon monoxide from a nearby furnace and
pumped it throughout the house while they slept in Roslyn Heights
of New York State, the United States, said reports reaching here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted police as saying that Andrei Kranz, 46,
discovered the bodies of his parents, his 2-year-old daughter, two
house guests and a baby sitter on Sunday. Kranz's wife and 17-year-
old daughter were visiting relatives in Romania.
</P>
<P>
Police said an alarm that could have detected the poisonous gas
had been turned off in the house.
</P>
<P>
Kranz later said he had disconnected his home's carbon-monoxide
alarm because it buzzed repeatedly and he thought it was
malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
The air conditioner had one intake vent closed and another
clogged with leaves, so it could draw air only from the room it
shared with the natural-gas furnace, investigators said.

<HEADLINE> WTO Members Agree to Confidence-Building Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The ruling General Council of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) has approved a series of measures
designed to raise confidence in the multilateral trading system by
addressing the needs of developing countries, including the world'
s poorest.
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangements agreed by the General Council on May 3
and May 8, WTO members will begin in June a series of special
session of the General Council dedicated to tackle the thorniest
implementation issues and concerns, WTO Director-General Mike
Moore told reporters at the end of Monday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Those meetings will focus on finding mutually-acceptable
solutions to address the issue of implementation which many of WTO
's 136 members believe is the most pressing matter before the
organization. They have pledged to complete this process by the
Fourth Ministerial Conference which will be held before the end of
year 2001.
</P>
<P>
"The decisions taken in recent days, and progress we have made
in other areas, set us very much in the right direction," Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
The General Council also agreed Monday on a method for
addressing requests by several members for extending the
transition period for implementation of the Agreement on Trade-
Related Investment Measures(TRIMs). The General Council directed
the Council for Trade in Goods"to give positive consideration to
individual requests" to extend the transition period, which
expired on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The WTO chief also praised 13 of the WTO members for taking "a
significant step in a continuing process" of further opening their
markets to products from the Least-Developed Countries (LDCs).
</P>
<P>
"Collectively, these measures are beginning to add up to
tangible and meaningful market access improvements in favor of
LDCs," Moore said. "There is, of course, more that can and should
be done in improving LDCs' market access, but this is a good
starting point."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the work by the General Council in recent days,
Moore said that it had been of great importance to the future of
the global trading system and marked a significant step in raising
confidence among members that WTO and the multilateral trading
system can offer important contributions in promoting economic
growth and development.
</P>
<P>
In another arrangement, WTO members have agreed that Ambassador
Jorge Voto-Bernales of Peru will chair the Committee on
Agriculture, which is holding special sessions to take up new
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in Switzerland Lowest in Eight Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Switzerland has
fallen to its lowest level in eight years, dropping to 2.1 percent
in April, down from 2.3 per cent in March, Swiss Radio
International reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Economics Ministry was quoted as saying that just
over 75,000 people were registered as unemployed last month. That'
s nearly 6,000 fewer than in March, or a fall of 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Boris Zurcher, chief economist at the Federal Office for
Employment, said that the downward trend in jobless figures was
expected to last.
</P>
<P>
"Growth is going to continue, the unemployment rate will
further decline, so the prospects of the Swiss economy appear at
the moment to be very bright," he added.
</P>
<P>
Expectations are that unemployment could fall below the 2 per
cent level by the end of the year as the Swiss economy continues
to expand. However this could lead to Labour shortages in certain
sectors of the economy, which might in time lead to inflationary
pressures.
</P>
<P>
"For certain sectors, particularly information technology, they
are already lacking workers, and this might give rise to wage
pressure in the longer term," Zurcher explained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts pointed out that the official unemployment
figures, although highlighting the strength of the economy, do not
include everyone who is out of work. The real number, which
includes the long-term unemployed, those on training schemes and
those not claiming benefits, is thought to be much larger.

<HEADLINE> Russian Military Plane Missing in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A Russian military plane Su-24MR was
missing during reconnaissance a mission over the republic of
Chechnya on Sunday, reported Russian news agencies Monday.
</P>
<P>
The plane disappeared from radar screens of the ground service
while flying over a Chechen district. It is unknown what happened
to the crew of the lost Su-24MR plane. Maybe Chechen rebels have
shot it down, said an official of the Russian Air Force
headquarters, cited by Interfax.
</P>
<P>
Search for the plane and its crew is underway despite bad
weather conditions, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Su-24 bombers and Su-25 attack planes flew 16 combat missions
on Sunday, attacking rebel targets in southern and southeastern
Chechnya, mainly in southern parts of Argun and Vedeno gorges, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, the Russian military
declined to name the area where the plane disappeared, saying it
would complicate the search and rescue of the crew.

<HEADLINE> WIPO to Hold Diplomatic Conference Finalizing Patent Law Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) will hold a diplomatic conference here from
May 11 to June 2 to finalize the Patent Law Treaty (PLT) that will
simplify national and regional patent procedures, WIPO announced
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The harmonization of patent procedures made possible by the
PLT will benefit all users of the patent system," said WIPO
Director-Genral Kamil Idris.
</P>
<P>
The PLT promises to reduce the cost of patent protection and
make the process more user-friendly and widely accessible. Idris
said, "A streamlined and user-friendly application system will
translate into lower costs for users, making the industrial
property system even more accessible to nationals of developing
countries, small and medium-sized enterprises and individual
inventors."
</P>
<P>
Inventors seeking patent protection must as a first step meet
certain formality requirements in order to avoid rejection and a
consequent loss of rights. Those formalities currently vary from
one country to another. In standardizing them the PLT offers both
inventors and national and regional patent offices a number of
advantages:
</P>
<P>
-- Use of standardized forms and simplified procedures that
reduce the risk of error;
</P>
<P>
-- Cost reductions for inventors, applicants and patent
attorneys;
</P>
<P>
-- Elimination of cumbersome and complicated procedures;
</P>
<P>
-- Improved operational efficiency of patent offices and lower
operating costs;
</P>
<P>
-- Possibility to introduce electronic filling of patent
applications and related communications.

<HEADLINE> Salt Iodization Protects 85 Million Newborns Every Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- 85 million newborns are protected
from iodine deficiency every year from a ten-percent loss in
learning ability, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a tremendous accomplishment. It means that children
are smarter. It means they are finishing school. It means a world
of new opportunities is open to them," UNICEF Executive Director
Carol Bellamy told participants at the Eighth World Salt Symposium,
which began in the Hague Monday.
</P>
<P>
Iodine deficiency affects intelligence and the ability to learn,
according to UNICEF. It is the world's single greatest cause of
preventable severe mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
"Where population are suffering from iodine deficiency, average
intelligence can spiral downwards by approximately ten IQ points,"
Bellamy said. "This has serious implications, not only for
individuals, but also for the social and economic development of
entire nations."
</P>
<P>
She told the meeting that two major tasks remain to be
accomplished: the first is to reach the 30 percent of the world's
population that dose not have access to iodized salt; the second
is to sustain the progress already achieved.
</P>
<P>
"In many countries of Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of
Independent States, iodization rates have dropped dramatically in
recent years. This experience has taught us that we cannot be
complacent. Iodine deficiency is an ever-present threat to the
development of children."
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF chief called on the salt industry to support
implementation of the iodization legislation, now on the books in
most countries. She urged all producers to help improve the
production, quality and availability of iodized salt in the
developing world, through such initiatives such as encouraging
salt production in developing countries.

MOSCOW, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Air Force commander
Anatoly Kornukov late Monday confirmed reports that a Russian
reconnaissance airplane Su-24MR has disappeared in the republic of
Chechnya.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Monday it had started
implementing the evacuation of British nationals from the Western
African nation of Sierra Leone because of the deteriorating
security situation.
</P>
<P>
"This afternoon the (British) High Commission (in Sierra Leone)
has activated its evacuation plan and is contacting British
residents through the local warden network to give them the
necessary instructions," Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The move comes hours after a contingent of 250 British
paratroopers landed in Freetown, the capital city of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Cook said the troops will ensure the security of the airport in
that country.
</P>
<P>
A larger British force in Senegal, a neighboring country of
Sierra Leone, are expected to join the advance group to protect
British, Commonwealth and European Union nationals, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Britain sent a battalion of paratroops and five
warships to Sierra Leone to help Britons who may need to be
airlifted from violence there.
</P>
<P>
About 700-800 soldiers including support staff, as well as a
helicopter carrier, a frigate and three support ships were
deployed to that region.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Hijack Victims Appeal Again For Asylum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-two Afghans who were aboard an
airliner hijacked to Britain earlier this year on Monday began an
appeal against the British government's refusal to grant them
political asylum.
</P>
<P>
Legal officials said the hearings are expected to last three to
four weeks.
</P>
<P>
The passengers were among more than 170 people on board an
Ariana Airlines Boeing 727, which was hijacked to Stansted Airport
near London last February.
</P>
<P>
The four-day drama ended without violence after a tense
standoff on the airport with the British police.
</P>
<P>
About half of the passengers have returned to Afghanistan
shortly after the hijack ended.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen Afghans have been charged with offenses relating to
the hijack.
</P>
<P>
Six have been allowed to stay in Britain and the remainder are
waiting for their cases to be decided.
</P>
<P>
The Labour government has been criticized over the length of
time it has taken to resolve the cases of the Afghans.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Focuses on Detonator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Court attention was
trained Monday upon resumption of the Lockerbie trial at a circuit
board believed to belong to the detonator of the bomb that blew
Pan Am Flight 103 out of the sky, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Police witnesses testified on the fourth day of the long-
awaited trial that debris including a circuit board was found at
the site of the crash.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution introduced as key evidence the circuit board,
part of a brown suitcase and charred clothing believed to have
been with the bomb in the suitcase.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution intended to prove that one of the 20 bomb
detonators bought by Libya from a Swiss firm was used to trigger
the explosive device planted on board Pan Am Flight 103 and to
also prove that one of the accused bought the clothing that was
put in the suitcase together with the bomb.
</P>
<P>
Testimony focused on police search and evidence collection and
labeling. Police officers described to the court their exhaustive
process of collection and labeling via the use of log books,
pictures and video recordings.
</P>
<P>
The defense counsel, however, attempted to point out loops that
might have led to mislabeling of evidence or even unauthorized
removal of evidence.
</P>
<P>
Police officer Douglas Roxburgh, the acting deputy chief of
police search and collection of evidence after the Lockerbie
tragedy, told the court that anything with marks of an explosion
was logged as evidence and sent to experts for analysis.
</P>
<P>
But the Scottish police officer admitted that he had raised
concerns at a management meeting with superiors about the removal
of a piece of the aircraft that had marks of an explosion.
</P>
<P>
Roxburgh later said that he had ascertained that the one who
had taken away the evidence had been from a legitimate
investigating authority in Britain.
</P>
<P>
But he said that he had no knowledge of removal of evidence by
British or foreign intelligence agencies from the crash spot.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen al-Amin Khalifa Fahima
were accused of conspiracy to murder, murder and breaching of the
international aircraft safety act. They were standing trial at
Camp Zeist, a former United States air force base which was later
turned into a court with all necessary facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie trial is expected to last at least a year,
costing the British authorities an estimated 3 million U.S.
dollars a month.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Propose Establishment of Peace-Building Office in Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Monday said that he would shortly recommend the
establishment of a post-conflict peace-building office in
Tajikistan after the current U.N. mission finishes its mandate.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Annan said the office
would be with the function of addressing institutional, social and
economic development in an integrated manner so as to consolidate
peace and promote democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the United Nations Mission of Observers to
Tajikistan (UNMOT),established in 1994, was to promote peace and
national reconciliation in the country, and the reintegration of
the opposition into the political life of the country was a big
step along that path.
</P>
<P>
"The recent parliamentary elections, while advancing the
democratic process in Tajikistan, were, in the view of
international observers, seriously flawed, " Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Armed elements continue to operate outside the control of the
government, contributing to insecurity," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"Daunting economic and social problems must also be addressed
as a priority," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Tajikistan is entering into a new phase of nation building,
based on national reconciliation. While the United Nations
involvement can be rated a success, it was not without its price,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The achievements of the past years will be consolidated in the
further strengthening of the institutions in the country in
accordance with accepted democratic standards and the economic and
social development of Tajik society," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
UNMOT was set up to assist the Joint Commission, composed of
representatives of the Tajik Government and of the Tajik
Opposition, to monitoring the implementation of the Agreement on a
Temporary Ceasefire and the Cessation of Other Hostile Acts on the
Tajik-Afghan Border and within the Country for the Duration of the
Talks.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Security Council expanded its mandate to assist
the implementation of the 27 June 1997 General Agreement on the
Establishment of Peace and National Accord in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The mission is proceeding now with preparations for its
eventual withdrawal. All fields stations have been closed. As at
April 30, there were 17 military observers in UNMOT.

<HEADLINE> No Intervention to See Euro Dropping Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- European Union finance ministers
did not decide on Monday to intervene with the plummeting single
currency, triggering yet another round of falls of the euro.
</P>
<P>
The euro fell more than a cent from last weekend's climb after
the finance ministers of the 11 euro zone countries only expressed
their shared concerns about the weakness of the euro but failed to
meet market expectations of showing willingness to intervene.
</P>
<P>
The single currency started to climb back after hints that the
European Central Bank and the governments of the 11 euro nations
were to intervene by either raising the benchmark lending
interests or through buying the weakening currency.
</P>
<P>
The euro zone finance ministers only stated that the present
level of the euro does not reflect the strong economic
fundamentals of the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
"The growth is very robust in the euro area and an increasing
number of jobs is being created and the European Central Bank is
committed to ensure that this growth will remain non-inflationary,
" said a written statement issued after their meeting in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, however, vowed at their one-day council meeting
to speed up the ongoing fiscal consolidation and structural
reforms toward a knowledge-based, full-employment economy to
further increase the potential of the EU and euro zone economy.
</P>
<P>
They met after the single currency fell to another record low
last Thursday of 0.8845 against the United States dollar.
</P>
<P>
The single currency lost nearly 25 percent in value against the
dollar since its introduction 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The head of Germany's Wholesale and Foreign Trade Association
Michael Fuchs said on Monday that the European Central Bank should
intervene if the euro drops to 85 cents, well below its peak at 1.
18 dollars just after its inauguration.

<HEADLINE> Putin Advocates Patriotism at Victory Day Celebrations in Kursk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin on
Monday called on Russians to carry forward their fathers'
patriotism in the World War II and to revive the nation's
prosperity and pride by every effort.
</P>
<P>
"Pride in our country and patriotism do not emerge by
themselves. They live in our memory, live in such places as Kursk,
" Putin said at a meeting in the central Russian city of Kursk,
where he made his first trip after his Sunday's inauguration as
head of state to attend Victory Day celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was timed for the 55th anniversary of victory over
fascist Germany and the opening of the Kursk Bulge Memorial,
erected in honor of the Soviet soldiers killed in the bloodiest
Kursk battle during the World War II.
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of unsolved problems, but there is nothing we
cherish more than our mother or father, there is nothing that we
cherish more than our family, the memory of what our mothers and
fathers have done," Putin stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Today we are looking for the footing of our society, but we do
not need to go far in this search -- it is next to us, in the fate
of our fathers, in the way they managed to work and live, to
defend their homes, their native land." These moral standards of
the World War II veterans "should be seen by us as yardsticks,"
said the president.
</P>
<P>
He said it is inadmissible to save money on the memory of World
War II heroes.
</P>
<P>
He thanked every one who contributed to the war against fascism,
and urged all Russian citizens to work hard to make their
motherland rich and strong.
</P>
<P>
Putin, accompanied by Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, deputy
chiefs of the presidential headquarters and Labor and Social
Development Minister Sergei Kalashnikov, arrived in Kursk on
Monday morning, where he made a speech near the monument to
Marshal Georgy Zhukov and visited the Drama Theater for a meeting
with war veterans.
</P>
<P>
He returned to Moscow in the evening.

<HEADLINE> Three Civilians Killed by S. Leonean Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Three Freetown residents have
reportedly been killed by the guards of Sierra Leone's former
rebel leader Foday Sankoh on Monday.
</P>
<P>
They were killed when the armed rebel guards fired at thousands
of civilian demonstrators marching by the Freetown home of Sankoh,
leader of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone,
quoted witnesses as saying that the RUF guards fired into the
crowd using automatic weapons and a rocket-propelled grenade.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh's home has been heavily guarded by RUF fighters and U.N.
troops after last Tuesday's hostage drama.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were reportedly passing by Sankoh's home to
denounce the RUF's recent kidnapping and attacks on the U.N.
personnel in the country.
</P>
<P>
The armed clashes between the U.N. troops and the RUF fighters
greatly frightened the city's residents and reminded them of the
bloody battle when the rebels fought into the capital last
January, when 5,000 people died and many mutilated by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had nearly taken the city before the Nigeria-led
West African Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG) drove them out after
hard fighting.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Resettle 70,000 Black Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
has worked out a program to resettle about 70,000 black commercial
farmers on nearly two million hectares of state land over the next
15 years.
</P>
<P>
The major land resettlement initiative will cost the government
an estimated 5 billion rand (735 million U.S. dollars) in grants
and other administrative costs to aspiring, formerly disadvantaged
farmers.
</P>
<P>
An annual amount of about 300 million rand (44 million U.S.
dollars) for the 15-year period has been budgeted for the program.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Agricultural Minister Dirk du Toit Monday confirmed that
about 700,000 hectares of land is immediately available to start
resettling farmers.
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about substantial state assets here. About 15
percent of state owned land suitable for commercial farming will
be redistributed to the formerly disadvantaged," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the scheme would greatly enhance the land resettlement
and agricultural performance in the country.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement scheme comes amid mounting pressure on the
government to speed up its land resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
The land issue has been highlighted recently by the invasion of
private, commercial farms in Zimbabwe by thousands of war
veterans.

<HEADLINE> SADC-US Forum to Discuss Zimbabwean Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Discussions at the second
annual South African Development Community (SADC)-United States
forum are likely to be overshadowed by the escalating crisis in
Zimbabwe, Botswana President Festus Mogae said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The forum will be opened on Wednesday in Maputo by Mozambican
President Joaquim Chissano, who is the current chairman of the
SADC.
</P>
<P>
Although the Zimbabwean land crisis will not be on the forum's
formal agenda, Mogae, who has just returned to Gaborone after a
10-day trip to Nigeria, Germany and the United States, indicated
that the situation in that country is likely to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state of the SADC member countries and U.S. policy
makers will find it hard to talk about trade and investment
without taking account of the political violence in Zimbabwe, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"During my trip, it was all people wanted to talk about. We
know what is happening will adversely affect the region and the
perception the world has of us," Mogae said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Special Representative to SADC and ambassador to Botswana
John Lange said the United States is also closely monitoring the
events in Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda to Withdraw Forces From Kisangani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Rwanda have agreed to
withdraw their forces currently deployed in and around the city
of Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to a
distance to be agreed between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a joint declaration on the
demilitarization of Kisangani issued on Monday in Rwakitura,
Mbarara district after a meeting between Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and a United Nations Security Council delegation headed
by U.S. Representative to U.N. Richard Holbrooke, a press release
from the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration noted that the two countries will hold
comprehensive negotiations without delay under the U.N auspices
and the Joint Military Commission to agree upon the
demilitarization of Kisangani, the third largest city in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The seven-member U.N. Security Council delegation is touring
the region to look into the prevailing conditions for the
deployment of a 5,000-strong U.N. peace-keeping force to monitor
the cease-fire in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration, the delegation recommended that
the United Nations should deploy forces to Kisangani at the
earliest possible opportunity so as to exercise control over the
demilitarized zone around the city and its airports once the
parties concerned have withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
The delegation reaffirmed its strong support for the entire
Lusaka cease- fire agreement signed by all belligerents in last
July and called on all the signatories to ensure the
implementation of the agreement in all its aspects, the
declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration came out after a one-day clash between the
Ugandan and Rwandan armies which broke out Last Friday and ended
Last Saturday.

<HEADLINE> British Paratroops Arrive in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 250 British paratroops Monday
arrived in Sierra Leone's capital Freetown, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
These are half of a battalion of the British paratroops to be
deployed in areas near the airports in Freetown to help the
evacuation of British and other countries' nationals if necessary.
</P>
<P>
But "at the moment, we're not evacuating," Lieutenant Commander
Tony Cramp was quoted as saying in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the West African country deteriorated quickly
when clashes broke out last week not far from the capital between
the U.N. peacekeepers and the Revolutionary United Front rebels.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and countries like the United States and
Britain have ordered non-essential personnel with their missions
and other organizations to withdraw from the country.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Sierra Leonean Trade Minister Mike
Lamine and several RUF officials had been reportedly detained for
questioning by the Sierra Leonean government-controlled military
police in connection with an alleged plot to overthrow President
Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Lamine was one of the RUF members who gained cabinet seats in
exchange for a rebel cease-fire as part of the peace accord
signed by the government and the RUF in Lome last year.
</P>
<P>
The arrest was ordered by Johnny Paul Koroma, former army
commander who himself staged a coup against President Kabbah in
1997 but declared his loyalty to the president following the
restoration of civilian rule.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urged to Deploy Peacekeeping Forces in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's First Merchant Bank Monday
said that a speed deployment of United Nations peacekeepers to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) would enhance the success
of Zimbabwe's Millennium Recovery program as the government would
be able to divert the much-needed foreign currency to local needs.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in its weekly magazine that Zimbabwe's
participation in the nearly 21-month war in the DRC is too costly
for the country, which is facing its worst economic crisis since
independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the Millennium Recovery Program will be
enhanced if the proposed U.N. peacekeeping force is soon deployed
in the DRC," it said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has indicated that it would speed up the
deployment of 5,000 troops to the DRC, a move which will enable
Zimbabwe to start withdrawing its troops from that country.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, one of the challenges faced by the
Zimbabwean government is for its Millennium Economic Recovery
Program to be implemented in such a way that not only the present
and short-term problems can be resolved, but also a foundation for
sustainable and self propelling economic growth can be laid.
</P>
<P>
This is a pre-condition for any successful redistribution of
wealth or poverty alleviation policy, the bank stressed.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Promises to Continue Peace Efforts in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has promised
to continue to play an instrumental role in supporting regional as
well as international peace efforts in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs minister Peter Machungwa made the assurance here
on Monday in meeting with DRC Katanga Province Governor Augustian
Mwanke, who is in Zambia to visit some of the refugee centers.
</P>
<P>
Any rupture of peace in the DRC compromised the security of
both countries thereby provoking the influx of refugees into
Zambia, Machungwa said.
</P>
<P>
"The Zambian government, through President Frederick Chiluba,
will continue playing an instrumental role in supporting both
regional and international efforts in search of solutions to
restore and consolidate peace in the DRC," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed his optimism that peace would soon
return to the DRC and pave way for increased economic activity and
in return accelerate development in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mwanke thanked the Zambian government for receiving
DRC refugees.
</P>
<P>
Mwanke later held closed door meeting with Zambian Defence
Minister Chitalu Sampa.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (
MILF)declared in the southern Philippine island of Mindanao a holy
war effective 8 p.m. Monday, the ABS-CBN news channel said.
</P>
<P>
MILF technical committee chairman Ed Kabalu has confirmed the
declaration through a local radio station, the nation's leading
news channel said.
</P>
<P>
The war declaration came merely one day after the secessionist
rebels ended a 48-our unilateral ceasefire at 6 a.m. the same day.
</P>
<P>
Kabalu said the MILF was retaliating against the military
landing bombs near the residence of MILF chairman Salamat Hashim
inside Camp Abubakar, the main rebel camp, in Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
Sources inside Camp Abubakar were quoted as saying that MILF
leaders are now in a top-level meeting to discuss rebel offensives.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the just-concluded MILF ceasfire was only a "
propaganda ploy", the military also downplayed the latest news of
MILF's holy war declaratrion, saying that the rebels have long
been at war with the government.

<HEADLINE> Assad Leaves Cairo After Talks with Mubarak on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad left
here on Monday after holding two hours of talks with his Egyptian
counterpart Hosni Mubarak over the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders held one-on-one talks before being joined by
senior officials of the two sides, including Egyptian Prime Minster
Atef Obeid and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh.
</P>
<P>
In a joint news conference with Shareh after the summit,
Egyptian Foreign Minster Amr Moussa disclosed that Egypt and Syria
share identical views on ways to push forward the Middle East peace
process on the Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed the hope that Israel will withdraw from Lebanon
swiftly, noting that the pullout should be "complete" and include
all Lebanese territorial land, air and waters.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the withdrawal will be complete and comprehensive and
without delay and hesitation or problems over a water tank or a
farm or anything else,"said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"Such a withdrawal will be a prelude for replacing tension with
a normal situation," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped Israel will carry out all United Nations
resolutions regarding its conflict with Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Israel formally informed the U.N. last month that it will
withdraw troops from south Lebanon by July, ending its 22-year
occupation of the area. But a dispute over Shabaa farms, which
Lebanon claims as its territory but Israel rejects the claim,
threatens to ruin the effort.
</P>
<P>
If the dispute is not resolved, the Israeli withdrawal will be
viewed as incomplete by Lebanese resistance group Hezbollah, which
says military operations against Israel will go on if Israel
continues to occupy any part of the Lebanese lands.
</P>
<P>
Shareh said the Syrian-Israeli track of peace process is "going
through a very complicated stage."
</P>
<P>
It is very clear that Israel has been raising obstacles so that
the Syrian-Israeli talks cannot be resumed yet, the Syrian minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Syria demands Israel return in full the Golan Heights it
captured from Syria in 1967 war while Israel wants to maintain
occupation of a strip of the eastern shore of Lake Tiberias or Sea
of Galilee, the source of 42 percent of Israel's drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Shareh noted that contact between Syria and the United States
has been continuous and active, hoping that the U.S. will play a "
real" role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Assad and U.S. President Bill Clinton met late March in Geneva
to discuss ways to revive the Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which has
been stalled since January due to Israel's refusal to pledge a
complete withdrawal from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Syria's perspective as to widening U.N. peacekeeping
force to fill the vacuum in south Lebanon after the Israeli
withdrawal, Shareh said his country "resolutely" supports any U.N.
resolutions as well as their implementation.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the Israeli withdrawal from
south Lebanon will be complete.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mubarak and Assad agreed to the holding of a
foreign ministerial meeting of the signatory countries of the
Damascus Declaration in Cairo in June to coordinate Arab stance in
face of Israel.
</P>
<P>
In March 1991, foreign ministers of Syria, Egypt and six Gulf
Arab states, namely Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar, signed the Damascus Declaration to
strengthen their cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Global Habitat Meeting Opens in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Over 700 ministers, mayors and
representatives of non-governmental organizations across the world
met in Kenya's capital Nairobi Monday to discuss urban governance,
housing rights and poverty eradication in urban areas, among other
issues.
</P>
<P>
The delegates attending the five-day meeting, organized by the
Nairobi- based United Nations Centre for Human Settlements
(Habitat), will also review the progress made in urban governance
and management since the second Habitat meeting held in Istanbul,
Turkey, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the Istanbul meeting, the global action plan, the Habitat
Agenda, was adopted by 171 governments, involving six main areas
-- shelter, social development and eradication of poverty,
environmental management, economic development, governance and
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Habitat estimates that over 3 billion people in the world now
live in urban areas with the bulk of new urban population in
Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Habitat Acting Executive Director Klaus
Toepfer noted that "in this era of globalization, the urbanization
of poverty is a sad reality which must be confronted. We need to
ensure better urban governance and ensure that the poor are given
security of tenure." He said Habitat's work now follows a
strategic vision, adequate shelter for all and sustainable urban
development.
</P>
<P>
The Habitat will launch two advocacy campaigns, with one
designed to support the universal right to adequate housing by
providing the poor with security of tenure, and the other on good
urban governance, Toepfer said.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Li Xiankui, head of the Chinese
delegation, briefed the participants on the achievements the
Chinese government has made in housing construction and reform,
infrastructural improvement, urban governance and development in
the implementation of the Habitat Agenda since 1996.
</P>

behalf of Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, made a welcome speech

Belgrade and commemorating the martyrs who died in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed that the bombing, resulting in the death of
three Chinese journalists, injuring more than 20 diplomats and
journalists, and damaging the Chinese embassy, is an extremely
serious and unlawful act, which grossly violated China's
sovereignty and greatly hurt the feelings of Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The US again provided an explanation of the events on April 8,
this year, stating as they did last June that eight employees from
the Central Intelligence Agency would be punished. The scholars
urged the U.S. government to conduct a thorough and comprehensive
investigation into the incident and give the Chinese government
and people a satisfactory explanation.
</P>
<P>
Hua Junduo, acting president of the Chinese People's Institute
of Foreign Affairs, said that NATO's invasion of Yugoslavia
violated the UN Charter and international law, creating an
extremely dangerous precedent of armed interference in the
internal affairs of other countries.

human rights issue at all, but merely complicates the situation.

Ethnic problem in a country should be properly solved by its

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Bred New Strain of Anti-Insect Trans-Genetic Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have recently
bred a new strain of anti-insect trans-genetic rape. This is
expected to increase rape yield, minimize consumption of chemical
pesticide and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
Led by professor Guan Chunyun, a research group in the Hunan
Agricultural University in central China spent four years in
breeding the trans-genetic rape, according to a report in "Science
Times".
</P>
<P>
China has the largest rape growing area and output in the world.
However, insects are the major restriction to the increase of rape
seed yield in China. In the middle reaches of the Yangtze River
pests seriously damage the rape crop every year.
</P>
<P>
Chemical pesticides will easily cause drug resistance among the
worms and contaminate the environment, said experts.
</P>
<P>
Tests showed that the new strain of trans-genetic rape can
effectively resist worms and cause no pollution to the environment.
</P>
<P>
Scientists will further study the safety and stability of the
new rape strain and its influence to bees and pollination,
according to Guan Chunyun.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Scientist Gives Speech on Nobel Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- An improved educational system is
the key to promoting the development of science and technology,
said a renowned Swedish scientist in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Erling Norrby, Secretary General of the Royal Swedish Academy
of Sciences, gave a speech on the history of the Nobel Prize at
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
He said during an interview with a reporter of Xinhua News
Agency that it is very important to have a sound educational
system, which can select outstanding young people through
competition and then encourage them to create new knowledge
through scientific research.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Norrby is a doctor in medical science, and member of the
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the European Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"I have found the scientific research a satisfactory job,"
Norrby said, adding that he cherishes the positive opinions from
his counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"Scientists may not enjoy such popularity as film stars, but
they have their own place in the scientific establishment," he
said. "I feel overjoyed and I hope that other people can share my
feelings."
</P>
<P>
The world will celebrate the 100th birthday of the Nobel Prize
this year. Prof. Norrby's speech is one of a series of activities
which the CAS will hold to mark the event.
</P>
<P>
China has a good educational system, especially for such a
populous country, said Prof. Norrby. "I am very positive that
there will be some young Chinese scientists to receive the Nobel
Prizes in the not faroff future."

<HEADLINE> Remittance for Yuanmingyuan Relics Made Today: Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Poly Art Museum said today it made
the remittance this afternoon for the payment of rare Chinese
relics it has recently bought from auction houses in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A museum official, who declined to give his name, told Xinhua
exclusively that it remitted 1,109,607.97 US dollars and 7,743,750
HK dollars to Christie's and 2,098,135 HK dollars to Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
The official refuted some media reports at home and abroad
about whether the museum is able to make the payment, since the
seven May Day holidays made it possible to remit the money through
local banks.
</P>
<P>
According to previous reports, the two auction companies held
respective auctions on April 30 and May 2, as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
At one auction four items including a bronze tiger, a bronze
monkey head, a bronze ox head, and a hexagonal porcelain vase went
under the hammer. They were looted by the British and French
invading troops from Yuanmingyuan in northwestern suburbs of
Beijing during the Second Opium War in 1860.
</P>
<P>
Poly Art Museum bought the three bronze animal heads, while the
hexagonal porcelain vase went to the Beijing Municipal
Administration for Culture Relics.
</P>
<P>
Relics experts believed the three bronze animal heads were
taken from the same water clock in the imperial garden.
</P>
<P>
Auctions of looted Chinese antiques not only stirred rage among
Chinese relics experts and Hong Kong residents, but also prompted
laws over relics protection measures. However, the two firms
claimed the antique sales did not violate any laws in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
China joined an international convention on cultural relics in
1995, which supports countries across the globe to recover relics
looted or lost in wars, regardless of when the war took place or
when the request was made to return the relics.

<P>
SINGAPORE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF),
together with the United States and Thailand armed forces will
stage a joint exercise in southern Thailand from May 9 to 23, 2000,
Singapore Ministry for Defense (MinDef) announced in a press
release Monday.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, code-named Exercise Cobra Gold 2000 and being
the 19th in its series, is a joint-combined exercise designed to
enhance interoperability among the three armed forces, according
to the MinDef.
</P>
<P>
MinDef said "This year's exercises will focus on enhancing
interoperability in the planning and conduct of peace support
operations, including the planning and execution of a noncombatant
evacuation operation."
</P>
<P>
"As in previous Cobra Gold exercises, this year's exercise
will include joint-combined land and air operations, combined
naval operations, amphibious operations and special operations,"
MinDef added.
</P>
<P>
MinDef said that a 37-member SAF delegation will participate
as staff planners during the command post exercises and the SAF
participants will be deployed at various joint-command
headquarters in Nakhorn Si Thammarat, Songkhla, Sattahip, Korat
and aboard the USS Juneau and USS Fort McHenry.
</P>
<P>
MinDef gave no word if the upcoming exercise will involve U.S.
aircraft carrier the USS Kitty Hawk which has anchored on waters
off Singapore island.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, a public affairs officer on Kitty Hawk told
visiting journalists that the battle group led by Kitty Hawk will
set sail again after the end of Singapore liberty for its sailors
around the weekend and travel to Thailand to join Exercise Cobra
2000.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Vows to Promote Small Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- South African Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin Monday pledged his government's
continuous support for the growth of small and medium enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates at a national legislative conference in
Cape Town on small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) in
Parliament, Erwin confessed that the government has underestimated
the structural obstacles impeding the growth of small business and
misjudged the ability of the banking sector to promote SMMEs.
</P>
<P>
"The whole process of industrialization in South Africa has
been a process of under development of SMMEs. We have moved
towards the big and crushed the small," he said.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said that the financial sector as a whole has not made a
sufficient contribution to SMMEs and the banks are not familiar
with the sociology and economics of black business and therefore
can not evaluate risks for black-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
He said the South African government's policies on SMMEs are
correct, but implementation is wrong in many areas.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be more detailed in our implementation and
monitoring of the support of SMMEs. The Department of Trade and
Industry has to increase its capacity to do this, but we need to
develop a clear monitoring and leadership capacity at the
interdepartmental or presidency level," he added.

<HEADLINE> Two Roads Opened in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A road linking four districts in
Lower Shabelle region and another road connecting the Somali
capital of Mogadishu with the central regions through Middle
Shabelle region have been opened.
</P>
<P>
The former 28-kilometer road joining Shalambod, Qoryoley,
Kurtunwarrey and Merca districts was built by the Italian aid
agency, CEFA, with funds from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other roads, this economically important road has
no checkpoints where the traffic or the pedestrians pay money in
return for their safety.
</P>
<P>
The area has been controlled by the Islamic courts since
October last year.
</P>
<P>
But contrary to what used to happen, the other road in Middle
Shabelle region has been rehabilitated and secured by warlord Muse
Sudi Yalahow in collaboration with the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
The 70-kilometer-long road was previously impassable as bandits
robbed and killed whoever they wanted.
</P>
<P>
The commercial vehicles have to pay some money for what is
called the contribution to the improvement of the security.
</P>
<P>
Ali Sheikh Hassan, who is in charge of the security of the
road, told reporters that each of the big lorries should pay
180,000 Somali shillings (18 U.S. dollars) for back and forth.
</P>
<P>
The public transport buses have also started operation on this
road and only 30 cents worth of Somali money is charged for the
person heading for Balad town.
</P>
<P>
But in the past, one person needed to pay for same destination
as much as two U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two roads were opened respectively on Friday and Saturday.

<HEADLINE> EU Condemns Hostage Taking in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
condemned the hostage taking on the Philippine island of Jolo and
expressed concerns about the safety of the 21 hostages including
10 westerners.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement available in Brussels on Monday, the 15-
nation bloc said it strongly condemns the kidnapping and called on
those responsible to release the 21 hostages immediately.
</P>
<P>
"The EU will spare no efforts to secure their safety and early
release," said Portugal, which is serving the six-month rotating
EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
The EU supports all the efforts of the Philippine government to
secure the safety of the hostages and expressed its gratitude for
all the humanitarian help so far given to the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"The EU trusts that the government of the Philippines will
explore all possible avenues in order to resolve the matter
peacefully and to avoid harm to the victims," said the EU
statement.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers decided on Sunday to send Javier Solana,
the high representative of the common foreign and defense policy
of the EU, to Manila as a special envoy to express EU's concerns
to Manila.
</P>
<P>
Solana departed on Monday afternoon and is expected to arrive
in Manila early on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Solana said shortly before departure that he was not planned to
meet those who are holding the hostages on the Jolo island, 965
kilometers south of Manila.
</P>
<P>
A group of 21 people, seven of whom are from EU countries, were
taken hostage by the Abu Sayyaf (Father of the Sword) rebels from
a dive resort in Malaysia two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
They include three Germans, two French nationals, two Finnish
citizens, two South Africans, a Lebanese, two Filipinos and nine
Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
There were growing concerns about the health of the hostages,
especially a German woman who is suffering from high blood
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese hostage Marie Moarbes was seen speaking to television
reporters that the German woman needed a doctor badly in that she
had had three strokes in four days and was in a critical condition.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Kills Cattle to Contain Foot-and-Mouth Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian government Monday
decided to kill in the next seven days all the 17,785 head of
livestock infected with the deadly foot-and-mouth disease to stop
the spread of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
All livestock likely to be infected will be vaccinated in 10
days, the government's information office said.
</P>
<P>
The government has sent troops to seal off the border of the
southeastern province of Dornogobi, where the disease outbroke,
the office said.
</P>
<P>
More than 170 animals were reported dead since the disease was
first detected in the province on April 30. Another 17,785 animals
were infected with the disease, which is deadly to cloven-hoofed
animals but not people.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak was a further blow to Mongolian herders already
devastated by a massive cold that have killed more than 2.2
million head of livestock since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The quarantine control in Dornogobi led to the suspension of
local transport services but not international rail service.

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Vladimir Putin took the presidential oath of office in
Moscow Sunday and pledged to build a powerful and democratic
nation, completing Russia's first transfer of power from one
elected head of state to another in a solemn ceremony at the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. government will propose legislation this week to
explore ways to entice banks to offer checking accounts and other
basic services to low-income consumers.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>

rebel forces fought each other in a town not too far from the
capital, Freetown, and the United Nations force that is supposed
to keep peace between them sank deeper into disarray.
</P>
<P>
-- At odds with U.S. Vice President Al Gore, two Democratic
senators and a Republican colleague said Sunday that a portion of
Social Security taxes should be invested in private markets to

<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The computer virus that infected more than a million
computers last week was traced to a 23-year-old in the Philippines.
No arrest has been made yet, partly because no law specifically

time since January 1970, economists warned that the turbo-charged
U.S. economy has finally reached a pace bound to revive long-

<HEADLINE> China's Steel Industry Preparing for WTO Entry (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's steel industry still lags behind developed countries in
terms of technology, equipment, product quality, productivity, and
services.
</P>
<P>
The huge potential in China's steel market has attracted the
attention of many steel producers around the world, said Liu
Jinghai, deputy director of the Metallurgical Industry Economic R&AMP;
D Center under SAMI.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that huge supply of steel products from foreign
countries may cut down the market share of China-made products in
the short term.
</P>
<P>
Dong Yizheng, who has played an active role in helping Chinese
loss-making metallurgical enterprises out of difficulties, firmly
believes in the huge potential of Chinese steel producers.
</P>
<P>
"The underlying factor in reforms is to make them self-
motivated, and prompt them to reduce costs and enhance the quality
of their products."
</P>
<P>
Smaller producers should focus on ordinary products such as
steel for construction within the domestic market, said Dong.
</P>
<P>
Baoshan, China's largest steel producer, has pledged to produce
more high quality and high value-added products.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest steel producer, but it still has
to import seven million tons of steel products each year.
</P>
<P>
China's metallurgical industry will focus on developing and
producing more quality steel products in the next several years.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xichun, chairman of China Iron and Steel Association, said
China's industrialization process will fuel its steel industry,
which is instrumental to the country's development.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese entrepreneurs and analysts
attending an ongoing steel congress agree that China's entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO) will help improve the
efficiency of domestic metallurgical plants.
</P>
<P>
Dong Yizheng, senior advisor to the State Administration of
Metallurgical Industry (SAMI), said at "Steel 2000" that China's
WTO entry may not bring about too much impact on the domestic
steel market, as most of the world's leading steel exporters focus
on high value-added products while China still needs a large
amount of ordinary steel products.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's top steel producers such as Shanghai Baoshan
Steel Group Corp. and Capital Steel Group Co. have already entered
the global steel market. WTO entry will bring both challenges and
opportunities for steel producers.
</P>
<P>
Xie Qihua, president of Baoshan Steel, said China's entry into
WTO will facilitate his firm's reforms, which will narrow the gap
between the company and international giants.
</P>
<P>
Costs of imported materials will be reduced and international
operations will be improved for the Chinese producer, Xie added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- For the first time the Iranian navigation fleet will
be equipped with two giant 73,000-ton cargo vessels, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The vessels are among those previously ordered by the Iranian
government from the South Korean Hyundai company to be manufactured
under the supervision of Iranian engineers, according to the Public
Relations Office of Iran's Shipping Lines.
</P>
<P>
The vessels are scheduled for delivery on Thursday at the
southern Bandar Abbas port. A third vessel is expected to join
Iran's fleet in June, the report said.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey lost 345 million U.S. dollars in export
proceeds in the first two months of this year due to a weakening of
the euro against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Trade Undersecretariat in a report said that the
euro's 10 percent depreciation against the U.S. dollar in January
and February of this year caused a contraction of Turkish exports
to Europe in U.S. dollar terms and weakened the competitiveness of
Turkish export goods in European markets, especially textile goods.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that a weaker euro would harm Turkish
export revenues in the coming period as well, calculated at 10
percent of total export revenues.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish workers abroad have sent back home a total of
35.9 billion U.S. dollars since 1990, local reports said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank data show that workers' remittances increased from
3.25 billion dollars in 1990 to 3.54 billion in 1996, to 4.12
billion in 1997 and to 5.36 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, such remittances declined by 15.4 percent to 4.53
billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey ranked 21st on the list of countries attracting
large number of foreign tourists in the world in 1999, local
reports said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey generated 5.2 billion U.S. dollars in tourism sector last
year, hosting a number of 6.8 million foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
According to World Tourism Organization figures, 656.9 million
people visited countries other than their own as tourists and spent
455 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
France attracted 71.4 million, the largest number of tourists
last year and was followed by Spain, the United States, Italy,
China and Britain. But the United States became the first in the
list in terms of revenues in the sector and it was followed by
Spain, France, Italy and Britain in this respect.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Syrian Presidents Meet on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
Monday met here with his Syrian counterpart Hafez Al-Assad over the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders first held one-on-one talks before they were
joined by senior officials of the two sides, including Egyptian
Prime Minster Atef Obeid and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh.
</P>
<P>
In a joint news conference with Shareh after the summit,
Egyptian Foreign Minster Amr Moussa disclosed that Egypt and Syria
share identical views on ways to push ahead the Middle East peace
process on the Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed the hope that Israel would withdraw from
Lebanon swiftly, noting that the pullout should be "complete" and
include all Lebanese territorial land, air and waters.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped Israel will carry out all United Nations
resolutions regarding its conflict with Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Israel has told the U.N. that it will withdrawal troops from
south Lebanon by July, ending its 22 occupation of the area. But a
dispute over Shabaa farms, which Lebanon claims as its territory
but Israel rejects the claim, threatens to ruin the effort.
</P>
<P>
If the dispute is not resolved and the Israeli withdrawal will
be viewed as incomplete by Lebanese resistance group Hezbollah, who
says military operations against Israel will go on if Israel
continues to occupy any part of the Lebanese lands.
</P>
<P>
Shareh said the Syrian-Israel track of peace process is now in
a "very complicated" stage.
</P>
<P>
It is very clear that Israel has been raising obstacles so that
the Syrian-Israel talks cannot be resumed yet, the Syrian minister
said. Syria demands Israel return in full the Golan Heights it
captured in 1967 war while Israel wants to maintain occupation of
the strip of eastern shore of Lake Tiberias or Sea of Galilee, a
source of 42 percent of Israel's drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Shareh noted that the contacts between Syria and the United
States have been continuous and active, hoping that the U.S. will
play a "real" role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Assad and U.S. President Bill Clinton met late March in Geneva
to discuss ways to revive the Syrian-Israeli peace talks, stalled
since January due to Israel's refusal to make a pledge to a
complete withdrawal from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Syria's opinion as to widening U.N. peacekeeping
force to fill the vacuum in south Lebanon after the Israeli
withdrawal, Shareh said his country "resolutely" supports any U.N.
resolutions as well as their implementation.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the Israeli withdrawal from
south Lebanon would be complete.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mubarak and Assad agreed to the holding of a
foreign ministerial meeting of the signatory countries of the
Damascus Declaration in Cairo in June to coordinate Arab stance in
face of Israel.
</P>
<P>
In March 1991, foreign ministers of Syria, Egypt and six Gulf
Arab states, namely Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar, signed the Damascus Declaration to
strengthen their cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Denies Philippine Senator's Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday rejected the
accusation by a Philippine senator that Malaysia is cooperating
with Muslim extremist groups and is responsible for helping,
training and protecting them.
</P>
<P>
It also denies the claim by the senator that Malaysia did not
treat illegal immigrants in Sabah well and that Kuala Lumpur
planned to free the Sipadan abduction captives on its own.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Philippine Senator Rodalfo Biazon's statement
reported in the Philippine press Sunday, Foreign Minister Syed
Hamid Albar told a press conference here "On behalf of the
government,I wish to strongly deny accusations of this nature
which we regard as wild and baseless.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Malaysia is "not a place that provides
training or protection to terrorist groups whether they are Muslim
extremists or other terrorists or separatists."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has never cooperated with such groups and the
accusation made by Biazon did not help in efforts to reach an
understanding in resolving the Sipadan abduction problem, Syed
Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia had never planned any separate action to
secure the release of the 21 people who were abducted from Sipadan
island off Sabah, East Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia gave its support to the efforts being carried out by
the Philippine government for the safe release of the 21 captives
including Malaysians and foreign tourists, he said.
</P>
<P>
On treatment of illegal immigrants, he said Malaysia has always
given fair consideration to illegal immigrants in the country and
would have to take into account humanitarian factors when dealing
with illegal immigrants in Sabah because of the large number
involved.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid hoped Senator Biazon will have a better
understanding of the situation and not make wild allegations
against a friendly neighboring country with good bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Euro Level Not Reflecting True Value: EU Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers of the European
Union (EU) Monday shrugged off the low level of the European
single currency euro, saying it does not reflect its true value or
the economic fundamentals of the region.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a meeting, the finance ministers of
the 15-nation bloc agreed that they shared a common concern about
the present level of the euro which does not reflect the strong
economic fundamentals of the euro area.
</P>
<P>
The ministers as well as the EU commissioner for finance and
the governor of the European Central Bank (ECB) "share the view
that growth is very robust in the euro area" which includes 11 of
the 15 EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
"An increasing number of jobs are being created and the ECB is
committed to ensuring that this growth will remain non-
inflationary," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The ministers vowed to speed up the ongoing fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms toward a knowledge-based and
full-employment economy to further increase the potential of the
economy in the EU and the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
The ministers met at their scheduled meeting after the single
currency fell to another record low of 0.8845 against the U.S.
dollar on May 4.
</P>
<P>
The single currency has seen a steady decline after peaking at
1.18 U.S. dollars just after the euro inauguration on January 1,
1999, and it has since devaluated by 23 percent.

<HEADLINE> EU Sends Solana to Philippines on Hostage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on Monday
sent its representative to the Philippines in the hope of ending
the hostage crisis on a remote island of the Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Javier Solana, former NATO chief and now EU's high
representative of common foreign and defense policy, told
reporters before departing for Manila that he is only going to
meet Philippine officials including the president, foreign and
defense ministers to express the common concerns about the safety
of the hostages, of whom seven are from EU countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time that the European Union has decided to
construct a common policy concerning the interests of EU citizens,
" said the Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
Solana got the go-ahead on Sunday from the EU foreign ministers
who met in Portugal for an informal meeting discussing various
issues including the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Solana said there is no plan for him to meet the rebels who are
holding 21 mostly foreign hostages on the Jolo island, 965
kilometers south of Manila.
</P>
<P>
The group of foreigners were taken hostage by the Abu Sayyaf (
Father of the Sword) rebels from a dive resort in Malaysia two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The hostages included three Germans, two French nationals, two
Finnish citizens, two South Africans, a Lebanese, two Filipinos
and nine Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
There are growing concerns about the health of the hostages,
especially a German woman who is suffering from high blood
pressure and is reportedly confined to a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
The German woman was badly in need of a doctor because she had
three strokes in four days, according to Lebanese hostage Marie
Moarbes, who was seen speaking to television reporters.

<HEADLINE> EU Grants Aid to Montenegro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on Monday
decided to grant 20 million euro (about 18.6 million U.S. dollars)
in financial aid to the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Javier Solana, former NATO chief and now EU's high
representative of common foreign and defense policy, described the
decision as "very, very good news."
</P>
<P>
The decision to aid Montenegro was made at a meeting of the EU
finance ministers in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Solana said the aid, aimed at helping Montenegro deal with its
increasing difficulties, will be delivered within the next few
weeks as part of the stability pact concerning the southeast
Europe as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The aid, yet to be approved by the European Parliament this
week, will also be used to facilitate the coming elections in
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Solana, however, stressed the EU will not support a move toward
independence by Montenegro. "We are not in favor of things of that
nature," he said before departing for Manila to meet Filipino
leaders on the current hostage crisis on the Jolo island.
</P>
<P>
President of Montenegro Milo Djukanovic is scheduled to visit
the EU headquarters in Brussels on May 17.

cooperation at UN, WTO, APEC, ASEM, ASEAN, ARF, the Informal
Leadership Meeting between ASEAN and the People's Republic of

organizations on regional and international political, economic,
security and other issues of common interest, thus promoting peace
and development in the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
8. The two sides reiterate their commitment to the principles
of mutual respect for independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity. The Chinese side holds that Indonesia's stability,
integrity and prosperity are conducive to peace and development in
the region, and supports the Indonesian Government in its efforts
to maintain national unity and territorial integrity and to
facilitate ethnic reconciliation and promote harmony in the
country on the basis of equality. The Indonesian side reiterates

11. The two sides believe that in face of the risks and
challenges, to seek peace, security, stability, prosperity and

Nations Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, the
Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference and the universally
recognized basic norms governing international relations should
continue to be the basis of a just and more balanced new

interfere in the internal affairs of other sovereign states under
any pretext.
</P>
<P>
12. The two sides reaffirm their position that both the
principle of universality of human rights and the national
particularities of each country, including its cultural background,
should be respected. They consider it essential to exchange views
on the promotion of human rights at the international level in the
spirit of cooperation, dialogue and non-confrontation as well as
respect for the principles of state sovereignty and non-
interference in each other's internal affairs. They maintain that

principles of state sovereignty and sovereign equality among
nations or in contravention or violation of the principles on
which the United Nations itself was founded.
</P>
<P>
13. The two sides reaffirm the importance of resolving
international disputes by peaceful means and call on the Asian-
Pacific countries and the rest of the world to take cooperative
measures to build up confidence and trust. The two sides agree
that the Anti-Ballistic Missiles (ABM) Treaty and the Treaty on
the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone play an important role
in maintaining international peace, security and strategic
stability. The two sides support the endeavors of forging a
universal and effective compliance with the implementation of the
provisions of bilateral as well as multilateral agreements on
disarmament, disarmament of weapons of mass destruction in
particular. Failure to comply with these treaties will only
threaten regional and global peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> May Deadline for Framework Accord Cannot Be Met: Levy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Due to the slow progress in the
Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks, it is impossible for the
two sides to finalize a framework agreement by May 30, Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Levy made this remark in a cabinet meeting called by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, in which Barak briefed several cabinet
ministers about his talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat met for two hours Sunday night in the West Bank
city of Ramallah to discuss ways to advance the peace process so as
to reach the framework agreement on final-status issues.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Barak's office said the two leaders
exchanged ideas about a variety of matters, including the next
Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank and the final-status
issues.
</P>
<P>
Levy did not give a date as to when the two sides could strike
this framework agreement. It was reported earlier that Israel has
suggested the two sides reach the framework accord in June or July.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the meeting, Israeli Communications Minister
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer went to Ramallah to hold talks with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Barak phoned Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and briefed him about the ongoing final-status talks and his Sunday
meeting with Arafat, Barak's office said.
</P>
<P>
Barak also informed Mubarak that Israel will transfer three
Palestinian villages near Jerusalem, namely Abu Dis, Eizariya and
Suwahara, to the Palestinians in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was announced that the Israeli and Palestinian
negotiating teams are to meet again later Monday in an undisclosed
location near Jerusalem to continue their talks.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Policy of Detente Successful: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran's foreign policy of detente and
confidence building has been successful, as proved by the
increasing number of visits exchanged with its Gulf neighbors, said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Asefi was referring to recent visits to Saudi Arabia and Qatar
by Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani and Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi respectively.
</P>
<P>
He said the visits were successful and helped reach
understandings between Iran and its neighbors, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani's visit to Riyadh earlier this month was the prelude
to a security pact between the two countries, while Kharrazi's
visit to Doha paved the way for an imminent visit to Tehran by
Qatari Emir Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The status of the region is such that closer cooperation among
regional states is a must, Asefi said, adding that Iran's policy of
detente, as advocated by President Mohammad Khatami, is approved by
regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
Regional countries welcomed Khatami's policies and believe they
will help restore peace and tranquility to the entire region, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and its Gulf neighbors, for a long time in hostility and
mutual suspicion after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, have been
improving relations since Khatami took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Khatami himself paid ground-breaking visits to Saudi Arabia and
Qatar in May 1999.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Air Links With Europe to Promote Nepal's Tourism by Zhuang Meijie, Song Dejun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The increasing number of foreign
airlines shuttling between Nepal and different European
destinations has provided the country's tourism industry with
greater direct access to the much-coveted western market.
</P>
<P>
The opening of Lauda Air's service in Kathmandu earlier this
month increased to three the number of airlines operating from
Kathmandu to European cities, heralding a surge in tourists from
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Operating directly from the Austrian capital of Vienna to
Kathmandu, Lauda Air started its once-a-week inbound flight on May
4 and will increase its flights to three times a week from October.
</P>
<P>
"After the operation of Lauda Air, the number of inbound
tourists is expected to grow by 20 percent," said Bharat Basnet,
managing director of Explore Nepal, the authorized representative
of Lauda Air.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Transavia Airlines, a Dutch company that began its
once-a-week service in 1997, has decided to fly in twice a week
beginning this September, thus bringing more European tourists to
the country.
</P>
<P>
What's more, Qatar Airlines, an international airlines from the
Middle East, is also operating flights from Kathmandu to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Around 45 percent of the inbound tourists are from western
countries -- the major chunk being from Western Europe (33 percent)
and the United States (9 percent).
</P>
<P>
More direct air-links with western countries are certainly of
great importance for tapping the great potentials of this huge
market.
</P>
<P>
However, Nepal had mainly depended on Indian tour operators
till a couple of years ago when Nepalese travel traders had to pin
their hopes on Indian travel agents selling Nepal as their
extension package to the westerners touring India.
</P>
<P>
This dependency syndrome has greatly hindered the development
of the tourism industry in a country which has unique attractions
for tourists thanks to its geographical location, natural beauty,
bio-diversity, cultural heritage and lively arts and culture.
</P>
<P>
Although Nepal has sufficient facilities to accommodate more
than 1.2 million tourists, only some 500,000 foreigners visited
the country in 1999, bringing in an income of around 160 million U.
S. dollars in the year. This accounted for only 4 percent of the
country's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Direct air access to western countries will change the scenario
and bring more benefits to local travel agents.
</P>
<P>
"There is a big difference between dealing with European tour
operators directly and having middlemen in the business," said
Shashi Ram Bhandari, general secretary of the Nepal Association of
Travel Agents.
</P>
<P>
"There have been many cases when we had a tough time getting
our payments because we did not have direct access to the western
travel agents," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tourism experts argued that now that the dependency on Indian
travel agents has begun to fade, Nepalese travel traders need to
build a network to tap the western markets' potentials.
</P>
<P>
They said that what could back the move is a marketing strategy
like that of Transavia selling Nepal as a destination in different
European countries.
</P>
<P>
If the local travel agents can cash in on the encouraging
situation, there will be a great leap for Nepal's tourism industry,
the experts believed.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Detains Suspect of Virus Creator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine investigators searching
for the creator of last week's "Love Bug" computer virus raided
the home of a suspect here Monday and detained a man who may have
some connection to the case, officials said.
</P>
<P>
National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) officers detained the
man after obtaining a search warrant earlier as the target area
for investigation into the "Iloveyou" virus has been pinpointed at
an apartment in the Pandacan area of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they had not arrested the man because they did
not have an arrest warrant. Officers were reportedly waiting at
the home for a woman who also lives there.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports said the Philippines' NBI was receiving
assistance from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in
its search for the creator of the most damaging computer virus
ever.
</P>
<P>
The joint operation is expected to yield a positive result soon
in identifying the culprit, NBI chief Federico Opinion was quoted
by the reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said NBI agents were following leads that the virus maker
was a 23-year-old man who lives in Manila's lower middle-class
district of Pandacan.
</P>
<P>
The virus caused a flood of e-mails with the alluring subject
line"Iloveyou" to course through computer systems in more than 20
countries on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. security experts said clues in the virus code pointed to a
student at a computer college in the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Welcomes Investment From Zimbabwean White Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government has
invited white commercial farmers facing an uncertain future in
Zimbabwe to invest in Tanzania where almost half of arable land is
idle, the Guardian newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
As the Tanzanian government moves towards revamping the
agriculture sector, which is the backbone of its economy, foreign
investors are welcome, a high ranking official with the Ministry
of Agriculture and Cooperatives was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on press reports that Zimbabwean white
commercial farmers are considering the possibility to migrate to
other southern and eastern African countries to invest as the
occupation of their farms by war veterans continues, and
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe refused to evict the liberation
war veterans from over 1,000 white farms.
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that so
far the ministry has not received any formal request from the
white farmers or their agents in the country to seek information
on the investment.
</P>
<P>
But if they want any information on Tanzania, they can contact
the Tanzania Investment Center or the Parastatal Sector Reform
Commission, he said.

MOSCOW, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chairpersons of nine committees of
Georgia's parliament announced their resignation at a meeting of

Zhang earned his pilot's license from the Xinjin Branch of the
China Civil Aviation College in the city of Guanghan in southwest
China's Sichuan Province. China's only higher-learning institute
for professional pilots, the college began to train paying
students like Zhang in 1996.
</P>
<P>
His flight courses cost about 60,000 yuan (7,229 U.S. dollars),
and included 45 days of classes and about 40 hours of flight time.
Qualified students receive licenses authorized by the General
Administration of Civil Aviation of China, said Tan Dongchun, dean
of the college in Xinjin.
</P>
<P>
So far, 43 people in China have private pilot licenses.
</P>
<P>
Despite the high tuition costs, the number of people who want
to learn to fly is on the rise, Tan said, adding that not all of
the students are rich businessmen, entrepreneurs, or employees of
foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Bai Zihong, who had worked in a grain depot in Beijing,
enrolled in the Xinjin flight school with money borrowed from
relatives. After graduation, the 42-year-old became a pilot for a
collectively-owned airline in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Liao Xuefeng, a sales representative of Raytheon, believes that
China is one of the largest potential markets for private planes.
</P>
<P>
He said that many of China's business elites are in the 30 to
40-year-old age bracket. "They are rich and willing to keep up
with the latest international trends and fashions."
</P>
<P>
Domestic aircraft companies have taken note of this cultural
phenomenon. The Nanjing Aeronautical Institute in Jiangsu Province
in east China has designed a two-seat plane which will be put into
production soon.

<P>
Raytheon sources said the company may give Li a sizable

Li now owns a flourishing business in Shanghai. She believes

piloting a plane needs ground navigation backup," said Zhang.

<P>
Zhang Yue, general manager of the Yuanda Group, a giant air-
conditioner producer in China, is the first private plane owner in
China. He now owns four aircraft: one jet, and three Bell

inform aviation authorities of my flight route three hours prior
to takeoff."

<HEADLINE> Vice President Urges the Study of Jiang Zemin's Remarks on Party Roles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Vice President Hu Jintao has urged
the study of President Jiang Zemin's recent remarks on the leading
role of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in all fields and at
different periods of time.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remark during his just-concluded inspection tour in
the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, a predominately Muslim region
of northwest China.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, the vice president, who is a member of the
Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee Political Bureau, talked with local people on various
issues including enterprise reform, fighting corruption, the rural
economy, and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
In his talks, Hu reiterated the importance of studying the
essence of Jiang's remarks on the CPC, who has always met the
requirements for the development of China's advanced productivity,
led the orientation of the development of advanced culture, and
represented the fundamental interests of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The study of Jiang's remarks, which was made during a south
China tour, should be integrated with the study of Deng Xiaoping
Theory, Hu noted. The ongoing ideological education drive within
the Party should be regarded as a long-term task, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu urged that great importance be given to strengthening Party
organizations in state-owned enterprises that have been closed or
have gone bankrupt, so as to ensure smooth closure and bankruptcy
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the current anti-corruption campaign, Hu said that
an effective supervisory and control system must be created in
order to eliminate the soil and conditions out of which corruption
grows.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Red Cross organizations have become
a key force in China, providing aid to disaster victims and
promoting non-governmental exchanges, according to Peng Peiyun,
chairwoman of the China Red Cross Society (CRCS).
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross organizations play an increasingly important role
not only in disaster relief, first-aid training, and the promotion
of blood donations, but also in non-governmental exchanges, Peng
noted at a forum here today marking World Red Cross Day, which is
celebrated every year on May 8.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 82,000 grassroots Red Cross
organizations had been established in China with more than 20
million members. The CRCS collected and allocated 121.28 million
yuan (about 14.6 million US dollars) in disaster-relief funds and
materials last year.
</P>
<P>
World Red Cross Day commemorates the contributions of Henry
Dunant, founder of the Red Cross movement and the first Nobel
Peace Prize laureate.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding 137 years ago, the Red Cross movement has
experienced great development, and Red Cross organizations have
formed the world's largest and most united network for aiding
humanity.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony for the issuing of a photo collection featuring 25
Chinese winners of the Nightingale Award, the top honor in
international nursing, was also held here as part of the
commemorations.
</P>
<P>
Florence Nightingale, a military nurse in the United Kingdom,
was the pioneer of modern nursing, and the Nightingale Award,
established at the Ninth International Red Cross Conference in
Washington in 1912, is presented every two years.

Governors here Monday, with a pledge to make the Asia-Pacific a
region free of poverty.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day meeting, governors form the bank's 58
members considered developments in the Asia and Pacific Region and
the performance of the bank in the past year, with poverty
reduction as a dominant topic.
</P>
<P>
"The overarching goal for Asia and the Pacific and for ADB
should be to reduce poverty," said Tadao Chino, president of the
bank, at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
According to the Asian Development Outlook 2000, Asia's poor
account for two-thirds of the total in the developing world, with
about 900 million people living on a mere dollar-a-day income.
</P>
<P>
Since the financial crisis hit East and Southeast Asia in 1997,
poverty in this region has jumped by at least 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the governors strongly endorsed the ADB's
poverty reduction strategy that the bank adopted last November.
</P>
<P>
The strategy stipulates the need for pro-poor, sustainable
economic growth which is essential to poverty reduction and social
development including basic education and primary health care and
improved governance in the public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
To generate growth and fight poverty, the governors also noted
a need for taking advantage of globalization and information
technology while minimizing associated risks, improving
productivity in the rural sector, undertaking sound environmental
management and addressing the increasing threat of communicable
diseases such as HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the governors also discussed how to sustain the
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The Asian recovery has turned out to be more robust than
expected. The five most crisis-affected countries staged a
remarkable turnaround by growing at an average of 6.4 percent in
1999 following a decline of 7.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
With an overall growth of above 6 percent in 1999, Asia's
developing economies have once again become major contributors to
global growth.
</P>
<P>
However, the governors noted that while the region showed
strong signs of recovery, there are still many challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that it is essential that this economic recovery be
sustained. They encouraged countries in the region to continue
their reform efforts and establish an enabling environment for
private sector development.
</P>
<P>
They also observed that the strong rebound in economic
performance is the outcome of the concerted efforts of governments
and people in the region to undertake reforms and the timely
assistance provided by the international community including the
ADB.
</P>
<P>
The governors noted that the ADB has played an important role
in assisting the developing member countries (DMCs) emerge from
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
They urged the ADB to continue promoting inclusive economic
development, supporting good governance and achieving social
progress in the DMCs.
</P>
<P>
The ADB also pledged to improve its corporate governance,
saying it will strive to be "a premier development institution and
an example of international best practice for the region."
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to be more helpful to the Asian poor countries,"
Chino said at the final news conference.
</P>
<P>
Though facing opposition from the United States and some
European members, the bank won broad support from the governors
to initiate a study of its resource requirements, which, it said,
will provide useful information for considering its long-term fund
needs.
</P>
<P>
The United States opposes the bank's idea of increasing its
fund base while Japan stands for it.
</P>
<P>
"In order to fight poverty across developing Asia and to
achieve progress toward the international development goals, ADB
needs adequate resources," Chino said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa announced at the
meeting that his government will contribute 10 billion yen (92.5
million U.S. dollars) to set up a fund within the ADB for poverty
reduction.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the meeting, finance ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Japan and
South Korea agreed on a bilateral currency swap to strengthen
regional capacity to counter future financial crises.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, dubbed as the Chiang Mai Initiative, involves an
expanded ASEAN Swap Arrangement that would include the ASEAN and a
network of bilateral swap and repurchase agreement facilities
among ASEAN countries, China, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Analysts view the initiative as a symbol of a new stage of the
regional economic and financial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting, like the World Trade Organization meeting
in Seattle, the United States, and the U.N. Conference on Trade
and Development in Bangkok, was also marred by protests.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the meeting venue
for three consecutive days, demanding that the bank withdraw some
projects and loans that, they argued, would hinder rather than
improve the quality of life in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government deployed about 2,000 riot police to block
the protesters from the meeting venue.
</P>
<P>
Chino announced that the bank's next annual meeting will be
held in Honolulu, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was convened Saturday in this mountainous city,
some 1,000 kilometers north of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 representatives from most of the bank's 58 members,
including finance ministers, central bank governors and officials
from banks and international financial institutions, attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Governors, the ADB's highest policy-making body,
comprises one representative from each member and meets annually.
</P>
<P>
The board elects the Board of Directors every two years.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the bank also holds seminars on issues
ranging from poverty reduction and the international financial
architecture to the global networked economy.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1966, the ADB is a multinational finance
institution. With 42 of its members from the Asian and Pacific
region, the bank engages in a wide range of social and economic
development activities aimed at improving the welfare of the
people in the region.

<HEADLINE> Indian Air Force Chief Visits Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Indian Air Force chief Marshal Anil
Yaswant Tipnis  officially began a five-day visit to Sri Lanka
Monday after reviewing a guard of honor at the tightly-guarded Sri
Lankan Air Force headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
Tipnis, who arrived here Sunday evening, is accompanied by his
wife and his personal staff.
</P>
<P>
His visit coincided with heavy fighting between Sri Lankan
government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels in the island's northern
Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
However, officials here and in New Delhi have stressed that the
visit is a routine, scheduled one, unconnected to the latest
fighting in Sri Lanka and the Colombo's appeal for foreign help to
fight against rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
.
</P>
<P>
They said Tipnis would meet senior officials of the Sri Lankan
Air Force and visit Sri Lankan Air Force facilities in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Tipnis is also due to visit the Sri Lankan air base of
Anuradhapura outside the island's northeastern areas where the
LTTE rebels have been fighting a 17-year war for a separate
homeland for minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
Tipnis' visit began as Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee Monday was prepared to meet heads of all political
parties in the country in a bid to formulate a response to the
escalating military conflict in neighboring Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Indian defense officials said Sunday that New Delhi was gearing
up to help Sri Lanka with humanitarian aid but no military
preparations were being made.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, who captured the Elephant Pass army garrison
at the entrance to Jaffna peninsula on April 22, have pledged to
capture their former stronghold of Jaffna town.

<HEADLINE> Sandstorms Bring Serious Damage to Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Recent frequent sandstorms in north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have resulted in
devastation of farmland as well as losses of tens of millions of
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The storms from April 12 to 16 buried nearly 10 hectares of
wheat fields in the Alxa Left Banner in the northwestern part of
the region, resulted in deaths or injuries of over 2,000 livestock,
and produced direct economic loss of 1.2 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yun Cuirong, an official with the local civil affairs
department, said that over 2,000 head of livestock were either
dead or injured in the powerful storm on April 24-25 in the Otog
Banner.
</P>
<P>
Among all the areas hit, the Alxa Left Banner and the Ejin
Banner suffered financial loss of 11 million yuan (about 1.32
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the two banners, a total 376 wells were buried in sand, 800,
000 kg of fodder was blown away, and over 4,000 livestock were

<HEADLINE> World's Thinnest River Identified in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese environmental scientists
recently identified the thinnest river in the world, only a dozen
centimeters at its widest, on the Inner Mongolia Plateau in north
China.
</P>
<P>
As one of four branches entering Dalai Nur Lake in the Hexigten
Grasslands nature reserve, this is the 17-km-long Haolai River.
The word "Haolai" in the Mongolian language means the entrance to
the throat.
</P>
<P>
The depth of the river is about 50 cm, while the width is from a
dozen to a few centimeters, and a notebook can serve as a bridge
over this river.
</P>
<P>
Experts have found that the source of the river is an
underground spring, and the water flow is steady with a wide
expanse of land flanking it.
</P>
<P>
The experts say they are surprised to see that this narrow river
has all the conditions common to any natural river.
</P>
<P>
They also proved that the Haolai River has been flowing for more
than 10,000 years.

<HEADLINE> Thriving Campus Condom Sales Upset Parents, Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Within days, boxes of vending
machine condoms were sold out at Nankai University in Tianjin. Now
some parents and teachers say the school is sending out the wrong
message about premarital sex.
</P>
<P>
Available in a coin-operated machine near a student dining hall
were two styles of condoms, in five yuan (60 US cents) and ten-
yuan (1.2 US dollars) boxes, labeled with the eye-catching Chinese
characters for "condom."
</P>
<P>
While the university's recent condom sales have generated
disagreements among students, dads and moms are voicing the
strongest objections.
</P>
<P>
One parent observed that most of the condom buyers are
undergraduates who are too young to have sex. He was also angry
that his child lives in an environment where condoms are so
readily available.
</P>
<P>
He said he had no problem with a university offering sex
education classes, but that offering condoms in vending machines
is too liberal-minded.
</P>
<P>
The students who favor the condom sales point out that the
university wouldn't have put the vending machine on campus if
there weren't a need for it.
</P>
<P>
But others said its presence suggests that the school
administration condones students having sex.
</P>
<P>
The majority of teachers said condom vending machines have no
place at a college, while a few argued that college students are
old enough to make their own decisions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, condom vending machines appear at colleges and the
same debate has raged at schools in Beijing, Shanghai, Harbin and
Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Condoms are available in many drugstores, but a lot of Chinese
are embarrassed about buying birth control products in public.

<HEADLINE> HK, U.S. Firms Join Hands in Developing China's Telecom Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong-based CCT Telecom
Holdings Ltd. and the U.S. Lucent Technologies Co. Ltd. announced
Monday that they jointly launched a strategic alliance to provide
marketing, staging and integration services for value-added,
integrated optical networking solutions to their customers in
China.
</P>
<P>
The projects to be undertaken by the coalition are expected to
represent an estimated market value of several hundred million U.S.
dollars in additional sales for the two companies over the coming
three years.
</P>
<P>
The alliance will serve customers in China's mainland and Hong
Kong, focusing on applications related to Lucent's expertise in
product areas such as optical networking, dense wavelength
division multiplexing and related network integration.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom, one of the largest Internet and value-added
service providers in Hong Kong, brings to the alliance its
experience as an integrator and operator of data and
telecommunications networks, with an emphasis on systems
integration, Internet service provider services, Internet protocol
applications and intelligent buildings.
</P>
<P>
"We are proud to be working with Lucent, one of the leading
international telecommunications companies, to develop their
business in China," Chairman of CCT Telecom Clement Mak said at a
media briefing Monday morning. "We look forward to growing this
new business together with Lucent."
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom, with its strong connections and experience in
China's market, has become the partner of choice for many foreign
companies looking for a bridge into the mainland market, Mak said.
</P>
<P>
Harry Bosco, president of Lucent's Optical Networking Group,
said that by entering into this relationship with CCT Telecom,
Lucent will be more competitively positioned to serve its
customers in China.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom established its hi-tech businesses long ago and
these assets now include data centers, broadband access,
multimedia content, VSAT systems, fiber optic networks and telecom
product manufacturing, Bosco said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe our coalition with CCT Telecom will offer both
Lucent and CCT Telecom the opportunity to be more successful by
dovetailing our strength, which will make our customers more
successful," Bosco noted.
</P>
<P>
Lucent has so far seven regional offices, eight joint ventures
and three wholly-owned companies, with more than 3,500 employees

<HEADLINE> Manila Jail Warden Dismissed for Jail Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Interior and Local
Government Secretary Alfredo Lim ordered Monday the dismissal of
Manila City Jail Warden George Talania following a series of riots
last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lim also directed Aquilino Jacob, director of the Bureau of
Jail Management and Penology to conduct an investigation into the
incident which left 12 inmates injured and resulted in the escape
of two prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The two escapees, identified as Rolando Canio and Johndee Dizon,
were facing charges of illegal possession of firearms and highway
robbery, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Lim designated Chief Inspector Romeo Elisan of the Valenzuela
City Jail in Metro Manila as the new head of the Manila City Jail.
</P>
<P>
Lim expressed surprise at the fact that riots occurred three
times since Saturday evening without the warden and other jail
officials having taken the necessary steps to prevent them.
</P>
<P>
The riots, which went on till Sunday afternoon, were reportedly
triggered by the attempt of one group of prisoners to stop their
rival gang from escaping.
</P>
<P>
"Investigate immediately the incident and file administrative
charges against responsible jail officials," Lim said.
</P>
<P>
Lim also instructed Jacob to look into the possibility of
decongesting the Manila City Jail to prevent similar occurrence in
the future.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Symposium on Water Resources Opens in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Water shortages are severely
restricting the development of human society, and people must
become more aware of the water crisis and enhance cooperation to
maintain safe and sustainable water supplies.
</P>
<P>
An international symposium on the guarantee of water resources
for the sustainable development of big cities in the early 21st
century opened today in Tianjin, neighboring Beijing in north
China.
</P>
<P>
How to manage, develop, and make good use of water resources
has become an important topic drawing the concern of all counties
around the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the symposium, water consumed by world industry
and agriculture increased 20-fold over the past century, and
people today use 10 times more water than their ancestors in the
last century.
</P>
<P>
Water resources also have become severely polluted. The United
Nations has warned that without forceful action, one-third of the
world's population will not have access to safe drinking water by
the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
China, with more than 1.2 billion people, is facing the same
problem. About half of its some 600 cities are short of water, and
100 are mired in a water crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Minister of Water Resources Zhou Wenzhi, Tianjin
Mayor Li Shenglin, Beijing Vice Mayor Yue Fuhong, and H.O.
Braeutigam, a special envoy of the government of Germany, all
urged protection of water resources for the future of humanity.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will close May 10. The Tianjin Municipal
Government, one of the sponsors, also invited four well-known
Chinese and foreign water resources experts to serve as
consultants.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Following are the major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers on Monday:
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The headquarters of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon has formulated several options on how to fulfill its
responsibilities in south lebanon after the Israeli withdrawal,
under the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The draft plans envisage several possible scenarios, but they
are primarily based on the prospect of the expansion of the U.N.
force from its present level of 4,500 troops so that it can be
deployed in a much larger area.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israel Defense Force (IDF) stepped up its preparations
this week for its withdrawal from south Lebanon, readying itself
for the possibility that the government will move up the date for
the pullout, now set for July 7.
</P>
<P>
In General Staff discussions held over the past few days,
various IDF branches involved were instructed to accelerate their
preparations for a unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli cabinet approved on Sunday in principle the tax
reform plan, but Prime Minister Ehud Barak agreed to discuss
changes following complaints from several ministers.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen ministers supported the reform plan. The cabinet named
a ministerial committee to be headed by Justice Minister Yossi
Beilin to examine the different elements of reform.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Two brothers, aged 18 and nine, suffered light to moderate
wounds on Sunday after an assailant entered their apartment in
Jerusalem's east Talpiot neighborhood and stabbed them in the back,
chest and hand before fleeing to the nearby Arab neighborhood of
Sur Naher.
</P>
<P>
Police said the attack may have had nationalist motives but they
have not yet ruled out the possibility that it was a criminal act.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Increase Aquaculture Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is aiming to increase
aquaculture production to 48,000 tons this year, the Ministry of
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that the government has
undertaken a program to develop the inland fisheries industry and
increase the country's annual aquaculture production up to 60,000
tons by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Sri Lanka's aquaculture production was 32,000 tons, a
5-percent increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The government established the National Aquaculture Development
Authority in January 1999 to tap the potential of the inland
fisheries and aquaculture sector.
</P>
<P>
More than 3 million fingerlings were produced under aquaculture
development and community-based programs and released to 80 rural
tanks during 1999, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said the government plans to extend aquaculture farming in
rural areas to another 300 tanks by December this year.
</P>
<P>
There are 25,000 tanks in Sri Lanka, of which 10,000 tanks have
been identified as suitable for aquaculture farming.

<HEADLINE> Manila Expands Task Force on Urban Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
expanded the membership of a task force charged with the
investigation of the collapse of Urban Bank last month in a bid to
pinpoint the culprits behind the bank's fall, a senior official
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Justice Secretary Artemio Tuquero said in a radio speech that
the membership of the task force has been increased from six to 10
and is now mandated to receive complaints from agencies other than
the Central Bank of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"We restructured it so it can receive complaints from the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Central Bank, the
Department of Finance and other financial and banking institutions,
" Tuquero said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he expects government prosecutors to complete
their probe into the Urban Bank case in 45 days.
</P>
<P>
Tuquero said the membership and powers of the task force have
been expanded to anticipate the filing of cases before the
Department of Justice by the Securities and Exchange Commission
and other agencies on the same incident.
</P>
<P>
Urban Bank declared a bank holiday on April 27, prompting the
Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. to take over its operations
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada earlier ordered the Justice Department
to create the task force to look into Urban Bank's collapse.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Participation in ADB-Funded Projects Low: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's participation in
projects funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is relatively
low, International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The low participation is due to Malaysian companies being
preoccupied with domestic projects and to the lack of awareness of
ADB projects and familiarization of the procedures and guidelines
for applications, she said at a seminar here on ADB's business
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged Malaysian companies to be more aware of new
projects funded by the ADB.
</P>
<P>
She said some of the new projects funded by the ADB that
Malaysian companies should take note of are a water resource
management project in Sri Lanka with a loan of 21 million U.S.
dollars, a road improvement project in Bhutan amounting to 75
million dollars,the north-northeast region roads in Thailand
totaling 162 million dollars and a housing finance scheme in India
with a loan of 300 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
She said that if Malaysian contractors and consultants relied
on the local market in the past for business operations, now they
must aggressively promote their products and services
internationally to seek new markets in view of the excess capacity
in the domestic construction sector.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, keeping abreast of activities of agencies such as
ADB will enable Malaysian service providers to avail themselves of
whatever support and facilities offered and facilitate their
venture into the export market," she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister told a press conference later that Malaysian
companies in the past did not utilize much of ADB facilities as
they could secure their own financing and sought for overseas
contracts by themselves.
</P>
<P>
It is about time that Malaysian companies look at regional and
global markets after having relied much on the local market in the
past, she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that what is important is that the
companies in the services sector cooperate and form consortiums to
be in a better position to secure big contracts overseas.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Malaysia's participation in the ADB
procurement of goods, civil works and consulting services amounted
to 589.3 million dollars or about 2.8 percent of the total ADB
procurement during the period from January 1995 to December 1999.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is ranked as the 13th largest supplier with goods,
civil works and related services worth 665.3 million dollars
supplied by Malaysian companies or sourced from Malaysia for
contracts and procurements awarded to non-Malaysian contractors.

<HEADLINE> 10 Sri Lankan Rebels Killed in Jaffna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka said Monday that
government troops killed 10 Tamil Tiger rebels in separate clashes
in the northern Jaffna peninsula over the weekend as the air force
continued bombing rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
"Sri Lankan Air Force aircraft continued to attack terrorist
concentrations at Elephant Pass," the government said in a
situation report.
</P>
<P>
Elephant Pass is the Jaffna peninsula's southern gateway which
was overrun by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) on
April 22.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, who have been fighting for a separate homeland
for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, have
pledged to retake Jaffna town, their former stronghold they lost
to the government in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government has mobilized the whole country on a war footing
to fight the LTTE rebels in fear of losing Jaffna town, the
cultural capital of Sri Lanka's minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
The situation report said troops operating in the Pallai area
Sunday attacked a rebel bunker and killed three rebels.
</P>
<P>
Government troops observed a rebel movement in general area
Ariyalai and directed artillery fire on them, the report said,
adding that six rebels were killed.
</P>

<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 8 (Xinhua) --The new computer virus "I Love You"
bug has been found in Guangzhou, capital of south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Computer Management and Supervision Section of
the Public Security Bureau of Guangzhou said they received

<HEADLINE> Old River Provides Evidence That China Ruled Over Xinjiang 2,000 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists said that the
Konqi River in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
provides ample evidence that the Muslim-inhabited area was under
Chinese rule more than 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Wang Binghua, a researcher with the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Regional Cultural Relics and Archaeological Research Institute,
said that many historical sites belonging to the Han (204 B.C-220
A.D.) and Jin (265-420) dynasties have been discovered along both
sides of the Konqi River.
</P>
<P>
These historical sites include ruins of beacon fires, ancient
tombs, barracks and ancient towns, and the famous Loulan city,
located in the delta area of the Konqi River.
</P>
<P>
Wang cited historical sites and cultural relics as evidence
that the region was ruled by authorities of the Han and Jin
dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The 730-km-long Konqi River originates from the Bosten Lake,
runs eastward along the northern foot of the Tianshan Mountain and
flows into the Lop Nur. A 500-km-long section of the river dried
up after 1976 due to water levels receding in the Bosten Lake and
construction of dams on the upper reaches of the Konqi River.
</P>
<P>
General Li Guangli of the Western Han used this road to march
westward and set up military stations along the old course of the
Konqi River. At present, 11 beacon towers built at that time still
stand along the Silk Road, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Barracks had been used until the fourth century, and
archaeological excavation in 1994 found large number of silk,
embroidery and brocade products, as well as bronze mirrors used by
Han people.
</P>
<P>
Wang explained that Loulan used to be a very important base.
Documents inscribed on wooden slips unearthed in the city record
that during the Han and Jin dynasties, troops were stationed in
the region.

<HEADLINE> Central China City Attracts French Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan, capital of central China's
Hubei Province, has become a popular investment site among French
investors.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Wuhan City Office for Overseas Investment
disclosed that French investment in Wuhan now totals 1.5 billion U.
S. dollars, accounting for 30 percent of France's total investment
in China, and 13 percent of Wuhan's total volume of overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
French investment in Wuhan is concentrated in the automobile
industry, with six French enterprises, including French automakers
PSA Peugeot-Citroen and Renault, having joint ventures or
components factories in Wuhan environs.
</P>
<P>
Four other service companies including Carrefour, Societe
Generale, and the Total-Elf Group also have joint ventures or have
opened branch stores in this central Chinese city. A dozen other
major French corporations have representative offices in Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
While French automaker PSA Peugeot-Citroen has announced it
will add one billion yuan (about 121 million U.S. dollars) to its
successful joint venture of the Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Co.,
Ltd. in Hubei Province, representatives for a number of other
companies including Alsthom and Total have been negotiating with
local officials for projects in electricity generation, the
production of lubricants, and operating schools cooperatively.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-French economic cooperation has also led to increased
cultural exchanges between Wuhan and French cities. Wuhan
University, for instance, has forged cooperative ties with more
than 30 French universities and organizations, carried out more
than 30 cooperative research programs, and held 11 international
academic meetings in cooperation with French partners.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan University has also made active contributions to
spreading French culture and technology in China. In addition to
creating a French-language department and three centers for French
studies, and offering more than 40 courses in French studies, it
has also sent 270 people to study in France, 100 of whom have
returned to China.

<P>
Though expecting a bright future, Chinese experts warn that e-
commerce is still at the very preliminary stages and still face
bottlenecks, such as authentication, payment, delivery and related
laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
"It needs the cooperation of all parts of society to promote
the rapid development of the e-commerce," said Wu Jichuan,
Minister of Information Industry.
</P>
<P>
A survey made by Computer and Microelectronics Industry
Development Research Center and CCIDNET Consulting shows that only
20.3 percent of Internet users have on-line shopping experience,
and only 40 percent of them are satisfied with on-line
transactions.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of Chinese Internet users worry about the
security of on-line transactions.
</P>
<P>
"I have visited more than one-tenth of these websites, but so
far, I have not spent a nickel on-line," said Chen Xiaoxing, an
Internet surfer.
</P>
<P>
This attitude indicates that making money through Internet
retail sales is still difficult. As one website owner said,
websites are spending rather than making money right now.
</P>
<P>
But the situation is improving, and the Ministry of Information
Industry is now busy promulgating the basic framework for the
development of e-commerce and related laws and regulations. Its
latest idea is a forum on e-commerce beginning on May 25 in 10
major cities including Shanghai and Guangzhou.

<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- In the past several years, e-
commerce in China was just a beautiful picture, but now it has
become a reality.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide survey found that China had more than 1,100
consumer related e-commerce websites by the end of the first
quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
Though China's e-retailing sales volume totaled 55 million yuan
last year, accounting for merely 0.018 per thousand of the country
's total retail sales, the survey predicted a 500 percent growth
this year.
</P>
<P>
What you can see with your eyes confirms this. Every day there
are two or three new websites conducting e-commerce, extending the
scope of their services, from economically developed south and
coastal China to the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The payment system, which used to be considered as one of the
fatal factors hindering e-commerce development in the country, is
now improved. On-line payment has become reality for banks
including the Bank of China, the Merchants Bank, and the
Construction Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Among all the e-retailing websites, 8848.net is the most
popular among Chinese Internet users, and more than 300,000
varieties of commodities are available at the site. Its sales
volume last November was 12.5 million yuan, and the figure was
increasing month by month.
</P>
<P>
"China now has nearly 10 million Internet users, which means we
have nearly 10 million potential buyers across the country," said
Wang Juntao, founder of the website.
</P>
<P>
Many computer and software manufacturers are also taking the
opportunity to present their latest e-commerce products in China.
</P>
<P>
Since last September when Microsoft unveiled its e-commerce
strategy in China, it has launched a series of promotional
activities here.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
urged an early conclusion of Sino-EU agreement on China's entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
During his talks with visiting Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen, Zhu said that negotiations concerning China's WTO entry
have entered the final stage, and that Trade Commissioner of the
European Commission Pascal Lamy has decided to come to China on
May 15 for a new round of talks.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to finish all the negotiations and relevant procedures
as soon as possible, and we would not like to see that the
European Union (EU) will be the last to reach an agreement with
China in this regard," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen said that Denmark firmly supports China's entry into
the WTO at an early date, and would like to continue our efforts
within the EU to promote EU to reach an agreement with China.
</P>
<P>
China and the EU held three rounds of talks earlier this year,
one in Brussels and two in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
EU was China's third largest trading partner last year. Two-way
trade volume hit 55.7 billion US dollars in 1999, up 14 percent
from a year ago. China was the fourth largest trading partner of
the EU.

<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China will build the world's largest
environment-friendly power plant, one that will create no acid
rain despite the fact that it will use poor-quality coal with high
sulfur content, the Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 250 million U.S. dollar plant, to be installed in the
southwest China city of Neijiang in Sichuan Province, about 150 km
west of Chongqing, will be equipped with a large imported boiler
using clean combustion technology, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
With an evaporating capacity of 1,025 tons per hour, the
desulfuration boiler is believed to be the biggest of its kind in
the world, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
This project, which was approved recently by the State
Development Planning Commission, is designed to produce energy
through burning poor-quality coal produced in the region, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China, which is rich in this poor-quality coal, has
been suffering from acid rain caused by the burning of the coal
containing large quantities of sulphur.

ANKARA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- The pro-Islamic opposition Virtue Party will hold its general
congress next week to elect its new chairman for which incumbent
leader Recai Kutan and the party's reformist wing leader Abdullah
Gul will compete.
</P>
<P>
The Virtue Party has been divided into two factions, the
conservatives and reformists. The latter is reportedly considered "
moderates" who support strengthening inter-party democracy and
playing down the Islamic color of the party.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said on Sunday that small
steps on common points are preferable in the relations between
Turkey and Greece instead of trying to solve bigger problems at
impasse.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have launched a dialog on the Aegean issue,
one of the main disputes which have made the two sides rivals for
decades.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Commercial relations between Turkey and Syria, which have
been frozen for 12 years, will be revived with the visit of an
economic delegation headed by Undersecretary of Turkish Foreign
Ministry Kursad Tuzmen to Damascus.

<P>
The visit signaled that Turkey and Syria are entering into a
period of normalizing their relations.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Overwhelming Support for Turkey's President-Elect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- An opinion poll showed that Turkey's
President-elect Ahmet Sezer has won overwhelming support from the
public, Turkish Daily News reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Turkey's prominent polling agency Polar
on 1,220 people in 10 representative cities, showed that 81 percent
of those interviewed expressed support for the president-elect,
while 13.9 percent disapproved of him and 5.1 percent had no
opinion.
</P>
<P>
The reformist-minded presiding judge of the Constitution Court
was elected to presidency by the Grand National Assembly
(parliament) on Friday as an outside-of-parliament candidate
sponsored by the leaders of all five parties within the legislative
body.
</P>
<P>
The career lawyer made headlines last year for speeches calling
for a revision of Turkey's Constitution, drawn up under the
scrutiny of the generals during the 1980-1983 military rule, which
Sezer said restricts basic rights and freedoms.
</P>
<P>
Such views have made him a hope of reforms in Turkey, which are
seen as essential to the country's bid for the European Union's
membership. The EU insists that Turkey carry out sweeping reforms
before being admitted.
</P>
<P>
"In society and in politics, democracy is not sufficiently
developed. A tradition of democracy has not been established,"
Sezer told reporters in his first comments after his election.
</P>
<P>
He pledged not to make concessions in the country's founding
principle of secularism to the Islamic forces in politics, and not
to yield any ground to Kurdish separatists.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that 75.4 percent of the interviewed
believed that he will be a successful president.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has nurtured Sezer's candidacy,
rallying an unprecedented cross-party consensus to avoid any
division that might jeopardize his government's 4-billion-U.S.-
dollar International Monetary Fund-backed economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit was upbeat about the future of his one-year-old coalition
government following the vote. "There is nothing we can't overcome
by choosing compromise on the basic issue," Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that consensus politics is an unusual phenomenon
in Turkey, where party leaders traditionally feud and plot against
each other.

<HEADLINE> Local Kidnap Victim Released in South Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- After more than two months in
captivity, the son of a businessman in the southern Philippines
was released by a group of kidnapers Sunday night, Philippine News
Agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Sulu provincial authority was quoted as saying Patrick
Viray, of legal age, was released after a reported ransom payment
of 200,000 pesos (5,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The kidnap victim, who was abducted by armed men while biking
in Jolo on February 25, has been reunited with his family in the
capital town of Sulu following his release.
</P>
<P>
Viray's kidnapping also took place in the southern Philippine
island province of Sulu, a fresh world focus for the ongoing
foreign hostage crisis there.
</P>
<P>
But the separate incident obviously had nothing to do with the
21 hostages who were abducted on April 23 from eastern Malaysia
and are still in the hands of their captors.

<HEADLINE> About 2,000 Illegal Imported Chickens Destroyed in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian veterinary department has
burnt about 2,000 illegally imported chickens in Ndola, Copperbelt
Province, Times of Zambia newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The dressed chickens, destined for the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) via Zambia, were seized Sunday from a congolese
national for failure to produce veterinary documents from Belgium,
where the birds were imported from, state veterinary inspector
Almond Sitima was quoted as saying by the paper.
</P>
<P>
Sitima said it was unfortunate that the owner had lost a
considerable amount of business but the veterinary department had
a duty to protect lives from agro diseases.
</P>
<P>
He said unchecked imported livestock or poultry could
complicate veterinary work as more diseases could enter the
country. There was no better way to resolve such a case than to
destroy the chickens because ignoring consequences of illegal
importation of products could be fatal, he said.
</P>
<P>
He advised businessmen to ensure they adhered to legal channels
whenever they wanted to import livestock or poultry to avoid
losing money.
</P>
<P>
On April 21, the veterinary department burnt more than 3,000
one-day-old chicks which were seized from another Congolese
national at the Ndola Airport.
</P>
<P>
The chicks were destroyed after the importer failed to produce
documents authorizing him to use Zambia as a transit route to DRC.

<P>
CHONGQING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality has introduced bio-technology in cleaning the Xihe
River which runs through its downtown area.
</P>
<P>
Trial use of the technology has produced encouraging results.

A total of 60,000 tons of waste water are discharged into the
river everyday by nearby industrial enterprises and residents.
</P>
<P>
The local government plans to invest 470 million yuan (about 56.
62 million U.S. dollars) to tackle the environment in the Xihe
River valley. Related projects include laying pipelines for
discharging waste water, dredging river course, construction of
urban flood-control facilities and scenic resorts.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Inorganic Anti-Bacteria Material </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Institute of Chemical Industry
and Metallurgy with the Chinese Academy of Sciences has
successfully developed an inorganic anti-bacteria material in
cooperation with a local company from Shimen County in central
China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The material has passed an appraisal by the Science and
Technology Commission of Hunan Province. Chen Yunfa, a doctoral
advisor at the Institute of Chemical Industry and Metallurgy,
spent three years developing the super-thin anti-bacteria power
based on zeolite, phosphate, and compound ceramics.
</P>
<P>
The newly developed inorganic anti-bacteria material is more
advanced in craftwork, costing lower, having stronger anti-
bacteria capacity, and finer stability in heat when compared to
organic anti-bacteria or natural anti-bacteria agents.
</P>
<P>
The inorganic anti-bacteria agents now in circulation in China'
s market are mostly imported from Japan.
</P>
<P>
The newly developed inorganic anti-bacteria material can be
conducive to creating a hygienic living environment when applied
to various other materials, including home appliances, daily
necessities, building materials, fiber products, stationery, toys,
and medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
The inorganic anti-bacteria material has been put into trial
production in Shimen County. The annual production output is
estimated at 100 tons, and the annual output value is said to be
30 million yuan.

<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Favorable economic conditions will
continue to boost the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in
China, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a nationwide survey recently
conducted by the NBS, the index of this industry will double the
level of the first quarter by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The health of the pharmaceutical industry has been improving
continuously since the first quarter, reversing a declining trend
in the previous three quarters.
</P>
<P>
The NBS predicts that the indicator of the health of the drug
industry will grow to 0.25 by the end of the second quarter,
compared with 0.12 in the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Establishment of Bio-medical Info Center Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scholar has urged the
government to establish a national center of biological and
medical information for life sciences research.
</P>
<P>
Hao Bolin, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS), pointed out that bio-medical information such as the
genetic data relating to humans and other species has been
profoundly influencing bio-technology, medicine, agriculture, and
other fields worldwide.
</P>
<P>
This information will become increasingly important for the
treatment of disease, agricultural production, and other human
activities in the future.
</P>
<P>
Although some small information centers exist in China, there
is no national database providing free access to this information,
Hao was quoted in today's Shanghai-based Wen Hui Bao daily.
</P>
<P>
The scholar suggested that, instead of the duplication of small
and separate centers, governmental organs and academies of
medicine and science and technology should join hands to launch a
national database and make the information accessible through
Internet technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China will build the world's largest
environment-friendly power plant, one that will create no acid
rain despite the fact that it will use poor-quality coal with high
sulfur content, the Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two billion U.S. dollar plant, to be installed in the
southwest China city of Neijiang in Sichuan Province, about 150 km
west of Chongqing, will be equipped with a large imported boiler
using clean combustion technology, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
With an evaporating capacity of 1,025 tons per hour, the
desulfuration boiler is believed to be the biggest of its kind in
the world, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
This project, which was approved recently by the State
Development Planning Commission, is designed to produce energy
through burning poor-quality coal produced in the region, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China, which is rich in this poor-quality coal, has
been suffering from acid rain caused by the burning of the coal
containing large quantities of sulphur.

<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- An old aircraft carrier from the
former Soviet Union navy has been turned into a military theme
park and will be stationed at Dapeng Bay in Shenzhen, south China'
s Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The 40,000-ton ship, known as the Minsk, first arrived at the
Wenchong Shipyard in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, in

reported today.
</P>
<P>
It is about triple the size of a standard football field, 18
stories high, and has more than 2,000 cabins, the paper said.

The carrier, which was poorly maintained by the Russian navy
after the collapse of the Soviet Union, retired in 1993 and was
initially sold to a South Korean businessman as scrap steel after
key military components were removed, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Minsk was later resold to an undisclosed Chinese business.

<HEADLINE> NZ Government to Set Up E-Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government is
moving fast to set up an infrastructure to encourage the public
sector to make more use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The plan to transform the public sector into a "true e-
government"was raised last week by New Zealand State Services
Minister Trevor Mallard.
</P>
<P>
According to the New Zealand Infotech Weekly, which came out
Monday, the e-government unit, announced by Minister Mallard, will
have overarching responsibility for coordinating e-government
initiatives across all government agencies. The appointments to
the e-government unit are likely within the next two months.
</P>
<P>
The latest-released e-government vision statement said New
Zealanders will be able to register information, access all
government forms and conduct financial dealings with government
and notify a change of address, electronically, "within the next
five years or so."In two or three years, New Zealand people will
be able to "pay their tax online, register a car and check out the
latest piece of legislation."
</P>
<P>
The weekly quoted the deputy commissioner of the State Services
as saying people's experience of dealing with commercial
organizations through the Internet has raised their expectations
of government service delivery levels.
</P>
<P>
According to the weekly, the cost for the project can be
between 125 million and 250 million U.S. dollars over the next
seven years. By then the public can expect 80 to 90 percent of all
government services to be delivered electronically.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Information technology experts in
New Zealand began relaxing Monday as it turned out that the Love
Bug computer virus had done its worst.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued Monday by the New Zealand
government, State Services Minister Trevor Mallard said New
Zealand government departments have fared well following the
invasion of the Love Bug computer virus.
</P>
<P>
He said there are no abnormalities in most government
departments and the few that have been affected are reporting no
major after-effects.
</P>
<P>
"I have not asked for a 'guesstimate' on how much the Love Bug
has cost the state sector. I am more interested in using the
experience of the last few days to make sure we keep on top of
developments to prevent the spread of future viruses," Mallard
said.
</P>
<P>
The Love Bug computer virus Friday hit New Zealand ministries
of education and fisheries. The Department of New Zealand
Statistics had to close down its external e-mail systems as a
precaution.
</P>
<P>
The affected organizations also included Wellington Newspapers
Ltd., the Ministry of Defense and the State Insurance.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Love Bug has cost New Zealand
businesses a few million U.S. dollars.

MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The southern Philippine city of
General Santos and nearby province of South Cotabato plunged into
darkness as electricity in the area was cut off Monday morning,
Philippine News Agency (PNA) said.
</P>
<P>
Local officials refused to give details of the outage but said
they are trying to locate the fault. Several areas in Mindanao
have had no electricity since early last night, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
Last week about a third of the city suffered a total blackout
when suspected Moro rebels bombed a 20-megawatt sub-station of the
local power plant.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, four bombs that exploded almost simultaneously
in General Santos killed 15 people and wounded several others.
</P>
<P>
The latest outage came as residents were gripped with fear amid
continued hostilities between government troops and Moro Islamic
Liberation Front guerrillas in the southern island of Mindanao.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Security has been tightened at all
key institutions following a bomb blast here last month, a
cabinet minister has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Herald newspaper on Sunday, Minister
of Home Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa said the police were on full
alert, particularly in those areas under its sphere of duty.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blast destroyed an art gallery and part of the
distribution offices of The Daily News on April 22 in downtown
Harare.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "On our part as the police, we have
certainly tightened our security measures."
</P>
<P>
He said the bomb explosion revealed loopholes within the
private security agencies.
</P>
<P>
None of the guards who were in the vicinity of the blast site
had observed the events leading to the explosion, he said.
</P>
<P>
The police had to be fed information by a passer-by, leading to
the arrest of a South African journalist who was later released.
</P>

A white person is understood to have phoned the police,
claiming responsibility for the bomb blast and threatening to use
force to rescue the South African journalist who had been picked

<HEADLINE> Team NZ's Star Helmsman Barker Turns down U.S. Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Team New Zealand's star helmsman
Dean Barker said on Monday he was offered a huge pay cheque to
jump ship to a Seattle syndicate for the next America's Cup but
turned down the offer.
</P>
<P>
Barker said many of the 80-strong Team New Zealand squad of
sailing crew, designers, shore support and sailmakers had also
received lucrative offers but most would not be tempted into
switching national allegiances.
</P>
<P>
26-year-old Barker said: "I won't consider it, no. I owe a lot
to Team New Zealand and it's the same for everyone else."
</P>
<P>
Team New Zealand completely outsailed the accident-prone Prada
Challenge of Italy to win the America's Cup 5-0 in March to become
the first non-American boat to defend the trophy successfully in
the 149-year history of the event.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealanders have since been swamped by offers from
international syndicates to jump ship for the next America's Cup,
to be sailed off Auckland in 2002/03, Barker said.
</P>
<P>
Barker revealed no details about the U.S. offer.
</P>
<P>
Elastic eligibility rules have allowed sailors to compete for
syndicates outside their country of birth in recent America's Cup
campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Review of Top Legal News Events in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are top legal news
events that took place in China last week.
</P>
<P>
No.1 Son Given 15-year Sentence for Killing Mother
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old student who killed his mother because he couldn't
cope with pressure from school was found guilty of homicide and
sentenced to 15 years in prison in the first ruling on the case.
</P>
<P>
Court reports said that on January 17, Xu Li, a second-year
senior high school student from the Fourth Middle School in the
city of Jinhua, in east China's Zhejiang Province, was in a bitter
argument with his mother when he threw a hammer at her head,
killing her.
</P>
<P>
The shocking news has been reverberating throughout the country
and re-ignited controversies about China's current education
system, which puts enormous pressure on students to get high
scores on college entry tests.
</P>
<P>
No.2 Divorce Rate Rising
</P>
<P>
New statistics show that China has entered its third divorce
wave since 1949, with 13 percent of all couples divorcing in 1999,
compared with three percent in 1979.
</P>
<P>
No.3 Love Bug Hit Chinese Computers
</P>
<P>
The software virus identified as "I Love You" has hit Chinese
computers as it did in other parts of the world but caused minor
damages as the country has been immersing in the week-long holiday
vacation.
</P>
<P>
Beijing-based Ruixing Computer Company received reports of
computer paralysation from domestic PC users just in hours of the
spread of the virus infection. Computer engineers of the company
cleaned out the virus in 40 minutes.

No.4 Chinese Paying More Attention to Domestic Violence
</P>
<P>
The Chinese public is paying more attention to the problem of
domestic violence today. Though a unified national law against it
may still take some time, legislation has already started in some
provinces and cities.
</P>
<P>
In Liaoning and Hunan provinces, local people's congresses have
passed regulations to curb domestic violence, and Shaanxi Province
is expected to follow suit shortly. And 13 provinces, regions,
cities and counties in China have passed local administrative
regulations to prevent domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
No.5 Murderers of Prosecutor Sentenced to Death in Hainan
</P>
<P>
Four convicted murderers who conspired to kill a prosecutor in
retaliation for putting them in prison, were given death sentences
last week by the Intermediate Court of Haikou, in the capital of
southernmost China's island province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
The victim, Huang Chonghua, was a prosecutor with the Hainan
Procuratorate, who handled a 1998 bribery case involving a local
tax official, Meng Wenteng.
</P>
<P>
Meng harbored a grudge against Huang, and murdered Huang on
March 16 last year.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were soon apprehended one after another, and Meng
was eventually arrested last November in neighboring Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Meng and the three men, Shi Zesheng, Pu Anjun and Wang Zhenhua,
were sentenced to death, according to the court verdict.
</P>
<P>
No. 6 China Develops Economical Fingerprint Identification
System
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists say they have developed the world's most
economical fingerprint identification system.
</P>
<P>
The new system, just half the size of a business card, was
created by scientists in a high-tech development zone in Hangzhou,
capital of east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The new system can memorize up to 3,500 fingerprints and costs
less than 500 yuan (about 60.2 US dollars), and a traditional
fingerprint recognition system costs at least 6,000 yuan (about
722.8 dollars) as it heavily depends on advanced computer
technology.
</P>
<P>
The system can be widely used in security systems, including
those in computers, car and door locks, and electronic commerce
systems.

<HEADLINE> 1stlead: Australian FM Confirms Ties With DPRK: AAP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Australia and the DPRK have agreed
to resume diplomatic ties after almost 25 years, the Australian
Associated Press (AAP) quoted Foreign Minister Alexander Downer as
saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Australia and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
have agreed to resume diplomatic representation on a non-
residential basis ending, from today, nearly 25 years of
interrupted relations," Downer was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Downer will hold a news conference at 0300 GMT (1:30 p.m. local
time).
</P>
<P>
Australia has become the second country this year to normalize
ties with Pyongyang after Italy established relations with the
DPRK in January, the AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Downer was quoted as saying that "both Australia and DPRK will
move soon to appoint ambassadors in accordance with normal
international practice."
</P>
<P>
"I trust it will also add impetus to the spirit of dialogue and
compromise on the Korean Peninsula," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK radio Monday reported that the resumption of ties was
for the development of friendly and cooperative relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries first established ties in 1974 but were
suspended a year later.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of relations followed a round of senior
officials' talks in Pyongyang on February 23-25, 2000, after
Downer's meeting with DPRK Foreign Minister Paek Nam-Sun at the
United Nations General Assembly in New York last September.

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf Wants to Negotiate Safe Release of hostages in Basilan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Muslim group Abu Sayyaf was
putting out feelers to the local government in Basilan in the
southern Philippines expressing their desire to negotiate for the
safe release of the remaining 9 hostages in Basilan, Philippine
News Agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the Abu Sayyaf's offer had been confirmed by
Basilan Governor Wahab Akbar on Sunday. "Personally, I will accept
their offer for negotiation now that they are at the losing end,"
Akbar was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Akar added: "It is not for me to decide on whether to
accept Sayyaf's proposal or not," as the military is presently
conducting extensive operations which the provincial government
and its constituency support.
</P>
<P>
He said the Abu Sayyaf, through its spokesman Abu Sabaya, sent
a note to him about the supposed negotiation that the extremist
group had decided upon, for the safe release of the remaining
hostages.
</P>
<P>
The hostages, all Filipinos and mostly teachers and school
children, were taken by the Abu Sayyaf on March 20 in Basilan as
human shields when retreating from a clash with government troops.
</P>
<P>
Most of the hostages, originally more than 50 in all, have been
freed while at least six were killed either by the extremist
Muslim group or in the group's encountering with government troops.
</P>
<P>
However, Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said two conditions have
to be considered before any negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf could
start -- the release of the hostages and the laying down of their
arms.
</P>
<P>
Puno, who is also the presidential spokesman, stressed that if
these conditions are not met, the government will continue the
military's extensive rescue operation for the remaining captives
and no negotiations could be held.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Police Chiefs' Conference Opens in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The 20th conference of police chiefs
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) opened here
Monday to seek ways of combating organized crimes across national
boundaries in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the three-day ASEAN Police Chiefs'
Conference, which is also being attended by representatives of the

Organized crimes include drug trafficking, arms and human

Profits made in committing these crimes, also known as

way to counter these problems effectively is for nations of the
world to collaborate, based on mutual understanding and balanced
approach.

organized crimes across national boundaries.

He expressed Myanmar's belief that only when there are
cooperating bodies organized in respective regions, it is possible
to effectively eliminate these transnational crimes, stressing the
significant role of the ASEAN police chiefs in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He called for exchange of information, expertise and
experiences to expeditiously cooperate with one another.
</P>

warning that the weakness in doing so may result in the region and
their neighbors being threatened and endangered.

productivity in the rural sector on which most of the region's
poor depend, undertaking sound environmental management and
addressing the increasing threat of communicable diseases such as
HIV/AIDS, Chino said.

as ADB dedicates itself to achieving its vision: a region free of

implementation," Chino said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that while the region shows signs of a robust
recovery, there are still many challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
They also observed that the strong rebound in economic
performance is the outcome of the concerted efforts of governments
and people in the region to undertake reforms, as well as the
timely assistance provided by the international community
including the ADB.
</P>
<P>
They agreed it is essential that this economic recovery be
sustained. They encouraged countries in the region to continue
their reform efforts and to establish an enabling environment for

<HEADLINE> "Love Bug" Sent to 61,500 Users in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- About 61,500 cases of the destructive
"I Love You" computer virus, which has caused havoc around the
world, were detected in Japan as of Monday, leading anti-virus
software provider Trend Micro Inc. said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) issued
a letter Monday calling on firms to be careful when handling e-
mail after the Golden Week holiday period.
</P>
<P>
MITI warned that computers in many companies may be affected by
the virus Monday when staff return to work.
</P>
<P>
The virus is carried by e-mail sent under the title " I Love
You" with a message saying, "Kindly check the attached love letter
coming from me."
</P>
<P>
The letter said computers are often affected by the virus when
users download visual basic script files, or "vbs" files, that are
attached to e-mail. The letter urged users not to open e-mail with
such files.
</P>
<P>
If they do so with the "I Love You" e-mail, the virus sets out
to destroy graphic, sound and other files stored in their
computers.
</P>
<P>
The virus, suspected to have originated in the Philippines, has
reportedly infected an estimated 45 million computers in more than
20 countries since Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Austria Marks 55th Anniversary of Liberation of Nazi Death Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Austrians and
representatives from some other European countries gathered in
Mauthausen concentration camp in Upper Austria on Sunday to mark
the 55th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp.
</P>
<P>
After a joint religious ceremony held at 9:00 local time by the
country's Greek Orthodox, Christian and Catholic churches and
simultaneous prayers in front of the Jewish and other countries'
monuments outside the camp, over 14,000 foreign representatives
and Austrians from all walks of life participated in a traditional
assembly on the camp's playground.
</P>
<P>
Before U.S. troops liberated in May 1945 the Mauthausen
concentration camp, some 170 kilometers west of Vienna, about 100,
000 people, who were forced into slavery by Adolf Hitler's Third
Reich, perished in the camp.
</P>
<P>
Several Austrian and foreign representatives spoke at the
assembly.
</P>
<P>
FritzVerzet Nitsch, president of the Federation of Trade Unions
in Austria, condemned those who have attempted to let the people
forget the past and seek political dividends by exploiting racism
and xenophobia, implying the inclusion of the far-right Freedom
Party into Austria's coalition government at the beginning of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Austria is under political sanctions imposed by other European
Union countries in February when the Freedom Party, whose former
head Jorg Haider was notorious for remarks praising Nazi policies,
entered the government and formed a coalition with the People's
Party.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that discrimination, which is the hotbed of fascism,
should not be connived.
</P>
<P>
Maximilian Aichern, bishop of the Linz parish, admitted in his
written speech that Austria's church did not take any actions
against the Nazis during World War II, saying that bringing the
past to account will alert people at present.
</P>
<P>
At night, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra performed Ludwig
van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and "Ode to Joy" in the
Mauthausen's granite quarry in honor of the innocent victims
slaughtered by the Nazis. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is the EU's
anthem today.
</P>
<P>
Austrian President Thomas Klestil and Austria's EU Commissioner
Franz Fishchler attended the concert. Klestil has publicly
declared his disapproval of the new government, while Fischler was
present on behalf of the European Union. The new government was
excluded from the yearly memorial concert.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the concert, Klestil described the Mauthausen
camp as a symbol of inhuman atrocities and expressed shame and
anger that some Austrians took part in the atrocities.
</P>
<P>
He echoed Aichern by urging Austrians to discuss frankly
Austria's dark period of history and pay off what should be
answered for.
</P>
<P>
Klestil took other EU countries' political isolation against
his country as an opportunity for Austria to rethink over its past.

<HEADLINE> Bondi Protesters Dragged off by Australian Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian Police removed some 20
protesters trying to block construction of the Olympic beach
volleyball stadium at Bondi Beach on Monday to allow a bulldozer
onto Sydney's world-famous strip of sand.
</P>
<P>
The protesters had staged a sit-in in front of the bulldozer
since the early hours of Monday to head off what they say will be
an environmental disaster for the surf beach.
</P>
<P>
But when their numbers dwindled from 100 to around 20, police
moved in and dragged them off, allowing the bulldozer to drive
into a fenced-off area on the beach.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, mostly Bondi residents angered at the
disruption to their community, had joined in the protest after
construction workers fenced off a large section at the center of
the beach to accommodate the Olympics' newest glamour sport.
</P>
<P>
There were brief scuffles early in the morning as the
demonstrators climbed on top of a bulldozer and two trucks, before
the sit-in began and the demonstrators started to chant and sing "
Don't Fence Me In".
</P>
<P>
Police commander Dick Adams said the protesters were generally
well behaved and had had little effect.
</P>
<P>
Sydney Olympic organizers have already delayed construction
work on the temporary stadium because of local hostility and
scaled back the construction design. The stadium will cut off the
central part of the surf beach for the next six months for the
sport's Olympic debut.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 37 in Ferry Incident in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from a ferry incident
which occurred in the waters off Ambon island in Maluku of
Indonesia on Sunday rose to 37, national newspapers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 37 bodies found by Sunday evening, 18 have been
identified, the newspapers quoted local officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations concluded that the ill-fated ferry
might have been overloaded as there were at least 125 people on
board.
</P>
<P>
Besides the passengers, the ship was also loaded with 40 tons
of cement, 20 tons of fertilizer, two buses and two trucks.
</P>
<P>
According to Maluku's sea transportation chief M.J. Manuputti
and head of the provincial office of the communication ministry
Suwandi, the listed people on board were only 62 passengers and 12
crew members.
</P>
<P>
"The ship had been checked and it was in a decent condition to
sail. But it is very likely that the vessel was carrying many more
unlisted travelers and that this was what caused it to sink when
it was hit by high waves," Manuputti was quoted by the Jakarta
Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ship sank while sailing on the Tanjung Tial waters,
Salahutu subdistrict, some 40 kilometers east of Ambon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Overloading ships is a chronic problem in Indonesia's shipping
industry, and maritime disasters are frequent in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has launched a malaria
control week to combat the disease as a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, which started Sunday, involves the country's
health departments and non-governmental health organizations, the
New Light of Myanmar reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the launch of the campaign, Myanmar Minister of Health Major-
General Ket Sein said it was decided at a meeting of Southeast
Asian health ministers and the World Health Organization (WHO) in
Yangon last October that the malaria problem in border areas,
especially in the Myanmar-Thai border areas, must be solved.
</P>
<P>
He said that a Central Committee for Prevention and Control of
Malaria has been formed in the country.
</P>
<P>
In February, Myanmar and Thai health ministries agreed to set
up a joint task force to fight malaria and HIV cases with
assistance rendered under the technical and economic cooperation
program of the two nations initiated in 1992.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Malaria and HIV cases have increased
substantially in about two to three years along the Myanmar-Thai
border from Chiangrai, Tak, Maesot to Ranong.

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Austria issue became a focus
again at the informal European Union (EU) ministerial meeting
held in Portugal's Azores islands over the weekend although it was
not on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Austrian Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-
Waldner asked the other European Union members to discuss the
lifting of the sanctions on cultural and sports exchanges with
Austria and proposed the establishment of an "observation period,"
but the proposal failed to gain support from the 14 EU partners.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero-Waldner said if there was no progress, Austria would
consider the holding of a referendum to show the will of the
Austrian people to the EU, but she said it did not mean an "
ultimatum."
</P>
<P>
Italy, Finland, Spain and Ireland indicated at the meeting that
there was the possibility of a resolution, which, Ferrero-Waldner
believed, signified the first step toward the normalization of
relations between the EU and Austria.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said earlier that the
Austrian issue would not be discussed at the two-day meeting and
the agenda would not be changed. After the meeting, Gama, whose
country holds the EU presidency, said no decision on Austria was
adopted by EU foreign ministers and the meeting did not mean that
the 14 EU member countries have a new posture on the Austria issue.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the sanctions were a bilateral issue between
the 14 countries and Austria.
</P>
<P>
The 14 EU member countries decided to sever their diplomatic
relations with Austria after the far-right Freedom Party joined
the coalition government on February 4.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Soccer Body to Question Suspected Drug Users </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The disciplinary commission of the
Indonesian Soccer Association (PSSI) will invite three players who
are allegedly consuming shabu-shabu (crystal methamphetamine) for
verification next Saturday in Malang, East Java.
</P>
<P>
Commission chairman Andi Darussalam Tabusalla said that his
commission was seeking confirmation from Kurniawan Dwi Yulianto
and Kuncoro, both from PSM Makassar soccer club, and Mursyid
Effendi from Persebaya Surabaya on their activities at Wetan hotel
in Surabaya on April 11.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to delay the verification from May 8 to May 13 due
to a technical problem. There is no special reason," he was quoted
by the Jakarta Post Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The verification is needed because the players gave different
accounts of their activities at the hotel prior to the match
between PSM against Petrokimia Gresik club.
</P>
<P>
Darussalam said that he was sure that his commission would find
the player who took illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
"To find the person is not easy, yet it's not so difficult. We
have Yuniarto Budi as our key witness. We will find the other
witness after we list the activities of the players
chronologically," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Yuniarto, another PSM player, who shared
the same room with Kurniawan on April 11. Both players allegedly
consumed shabu-shabu that day.
</P>
<P>
Kuncoro said in a written statement earlier that he was
persuaded by Mursyid to take shabu-shabu but Mursyid said it was
Kurniawan who encouraged him to take the drug. Kurniawan has
refuted Mursyid's statement.
</P>
<P>
Kuncoro reportedly admitted during a questioning by the
commission in Jakarta last Wednesday that he also took the illegal
drugs, but he refused to implicate Kurniawan and Mursyid.
</P>
<P>
PSSI questioned Kurniawan and Yuniarto in Makassar, capital of
South Sulawesi, last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kurniawan reportedly denied that he asked Mursyid to come to
the hotel, and he said he had no idea what Mursyid, Kuncoro and
another unidentified person were doing in his room while he was in
the restroom. After he finished taking a bath, the three players
had left.
</P>
<P>
Yuniarto said he did not know what the three players were doing
in the room because he left when they had just arrived at the
hotel. He said they had gone when he returned.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The momentum the Los Angeles
Lakers picked up in last Friday's Game 5 with Sacramento Kings
obviously carried over into Sunday's Game 1 with Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
Shaquille O'Neal overcame a slow start to score 37 points, grab
14 rebounds and block four shots as the Lakers trounced the Suns
105-77 in the opener of their Western Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Kobe Bryant added 25 points for the Lakers. Anfernee Hardaway
led the Suns with 25 points, while Cliff Robinson, who battled
foul problems, added 13 and rookie Shawn Marion had 12.
</P>
<P>
Jason Kidd, playing just his second game since breaking his
left ankle March 22, was held to three points, seven rebounds and
seven assists. Rodney Rogers, voted the NBA's Sixth Man of the
Year, was only 3-of-13 from the field and scored seven points.
</P>
<P>
Game 2 will be played Wednesday night again at Los Angeles
Staples Center before the best-of-seven series moves to Phoenix
for Games 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal's dominance was never more evident than one sequence
early in the third quarter. He missed from close range, got the
rebound over Longley, missed again, got the rebound again, and
scored.
</P>
<P>
NBA analysts say that when O'Neal shot close 60 percent in the
field, as he did during the past two games, the Lakers are almost
unbeatable in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Other analysts say the Suns, who hurt themselves by committing
23 turnovers to 12 for the Lakers, entered the game rested, having
eliminated the defending NBA champion San Antonio Spurs last
Tuesday night.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Thursday's
powerful earthquake that caused extensive damage in Central
Sulawesi, Indonesia, rose to 38, according to reports reaching
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The latest death toll was expected to rise further as an
extensive search for more bodies continued in more isolated areas,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Antara News Agency quoted local rescuers as saying that at
least 44 people were seriously injured and 115 others sustained
slight injuries in the earthquake, measuring 6.5 on the Richter
scale, that rocked the eastern tip of Sulawesi. The epicenter of
the quake was in Peleng strait, some 2,000 kilometers northeast of
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that hundreds of victims being sheltered at the
Trikora soccer field in Salakan town in Peleng island are
suffering from various diseases. Their health condition is getting
worse following heavy rains in three consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of the Banggai regency administration, M. Saleh
Akum, said he feared the number of casualties would increase,
particularly as a result of illnesses resulting from poor
sanitation in the shelters and a lack of doctors and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Further complicating matters, the Banggai island has been
blacked out since the earthquake hit.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the government to pay serious attention in handling
this matter, because the number of deceased is growing. We also
call on the International Committee of the Red Cross to help us,"
Akum was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.

Zhang, who suffered from heart problems since birth, underwent
the operation because his present medication would only guarantee
the normal function of his heart and lungs for another two years.
</P>
<P>
The operation lasted for four and a half hours in the No.1
Hospital attached to the Medical School at Zhejiang University.
Zhang got rid of the respirator 36 hours after the operation, and
had liquid food 48 hours later. He is now able to walk around in
the ward in good spirits.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons said that when Zhang came to the hospital, he could
hardly pass a two-minute jogging test. Even lifting a chair is no
easy task for him.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's blood pressure and heart rate are normal, and
comprehensive examinations indicate well-functioning of the
transplanted lungs and heart.
</P>
<P>
Yu Guowei, the surgeon, is optimistic about Zhang's recovery,
saying that Zhang will probably live on and return to work one day.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that first operation of this kind was performed in

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Pay to Irrigate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Farmers along the Yellow River will
pay 0.053 yuan per cubic meter to irrigate their crops with water
from China's second-longest river.
</P>
<P>
The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China worked out
the new fee rule in order to stop what is called "the excessive
flood irrigation" in the area.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers formerly paid water fees based on the amount of
land they planned to irrigate.
</P>
<P>
One hundred cubic meters of Yellow River water costs less than
a bottle of mineral water. Wasting water resources caused by the
flood irrigation has become a serious problem in the area which
has been diverting water from Yellow River for more than 2,000
years.
</P>
<P>
Hebei Province, which surrounds Beijing, has been mired in a
water crisis for four consecutive years due to longtime drought
and overuse of water. Farmers of the province will have to pay the
water they use like the people in the cities.
</P>
<P>
Charges will be worked out first in pilot areas this year and
the next year and then the prices for use of water for various
purposes will be decided and executed in the whole of the
province.
</P>
<P>
Water used for agricultural purposes accounts for 70 to 80
percent of the 22 billion cubic meters of water consumed annually
in the province, according to local officials.

</P>
<P>
The 648-km route starts in Hunchun of northeast China's Jilin
Province and ends at Sogcho of ROK, passing through the Russian
city of Zarubino. A one-way trip takes 17 hours.

dollars last October to run the route. It has prepared a passenger/
cargo ship which can accommodate 500 people and 100 TEUs.
</P>
<P>
The land-water route is expected to promote exchanges among

<HEADLINE> Three More Ibis Habitats Found in NW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts said that three more
habitats for the crested ibis have been found in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Nine ibis have been reportedly located by local farmers at
Caomiao village in Yangxian County, Heping village in Xixiang
County, and in Xujiamiao Town in Chenggu County since last October,
bringing the number of natural habitats for the crested bird to
five.
</P>
<P>
The bird, which is distinguished by its red crest, gray plumage
and hooked beak, is on the verge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
The crested ibis population has grown from merely seven in 1981,
when it was first found in China, to the present 200 as a result
of environmental protection measures adopted by the local
government, including a ban on fertilizers and lumbering in areas
close to the species' natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
The number of wild ibis has grown from 94 to 103.
</P>
<P>
To give local residents a better understanding of this rare
species and enhance their awareness of wildlife protection, Xi'an,
the capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, hosted its
first ibis show during the week-long holidays around the Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
The origin of the endangered species has been traced back 60
million years, with large flocks formerly existing in most of
China, Japan and Germany. But now the species is found only in
China.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Disabled Education as Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- More learning programs, ranging from
primary to vocational education, will be offered to children with
physical or mental difficulties, an official from the Ministry of
Education said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has signed contracts with regional educational
administrations to spread the word about special education
programs for physically disabled and mentally retarded children,
according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
To ensure more job opportunities for mentally or physically
disabled children, regional education administrations and labor
departments will issue regulations to help disabled youths find
jobs after they receive special education.
</P>
<P>
Before the establishment of the People's Republic of China in
1949, the nation had only 42 special schools for the blind and
deaf.
</P>
<P>
Today, China has 1,535 special schools in which 358,400
youngsters and adults who have physical or mental problems are
enrolled.
</P>
<P>
In China, special education targets physically disabled and
mentally retarded children.
</P>
<P>
If measured by international norms, China has a total of 20
million children who need special education, says the paper.
</P>
<P>
Training a physically disabled or mentally retarded teenager
costs an average of 4,000 yuan (about 482 U.S. dollars) a year,
while training a non-disabled teenager costs 1,200 yuan (about 145
U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Insufficient funds for special education have hindered the
construction of more schools, says the paper.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, U.S. Search for "Love Bug" Creator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' National Bureau of
Investigation (NBI) was receiving assistance from the U.S. Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in its search for the creator of the
most damaging computer virus ever, known as the "Love Bug."
</P>
<P>
The Manila Time newspaper reported Monday that NBI chief
Federico Opinion said the joint operation is expected to yield a
positive result soon, as probers are "near in identifying the
culprit."
</P>
<P>
He said NBI agents were following leads that the virus maker
was a 23-year-old man who lives in Manila's lower middle-class
district of Pandacan.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the NBI and the FBI will disclose the identity of
the suspect this week.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that agents could not obtain search or arrest
warrants because courts were closed for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The virus caused a flood of e-mails with the alluring subject
line "ILoveyou" to course through computer systems in more than 20
countries on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. security experts said that clues in the virus code pointed
to a student at a computer college in the Philippines.

LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool gave a disappointing
performance at home when they were held to 0-0 draw by Southampton
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the result, Liverpool left a space to Leeds United to
chase for a place in next season's Champions League.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool, who have now drawn two and lost two of their last
four games, all without scoring, were again toothless in attack
and lucky not to lose to the 15th-placed Saints.
</P>
<P>
The result means that Arsenal, who beat Chelsea 2-1 on Saturday,
are assured of finishing in the top three and earning a berth in
the Champions League.
</P>
<P>
Champions Manchester United have 88 points from 37 games with
Arsenal second on 72 from 36. Liverpool are third on 67 with one
game remaining but ahead of Leeds United only on goal difference.
</P>

Leeds, who host Everton on Monday, have two games left.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The assistant coach of the German
national football team Uli Stielike was fired on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the German Football Federation head coach Erich
Ribbeck had called Stielike earlier Sunday and told him that he
was not kept on.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the football federation said that because of
differing views Ribbeck saw no further basis for the constructive
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
After the 1-1 draw of the German national team with Switzerland
on April 26, the national team and Ribbeck were put under high
pressure.
</P>
<P>
The fans protested about lack of commitment. Some of fans and
football experts requested Ribbeck's resignation.
</P>
<P>
But Ribbeck rejected to resign and has got the support from the
leading figures in the German circle including Franz Beckenbauer
and the chairman of the German Football Federation Egidius Braun.
</P>
<P>
Uli Stielike, 46, served as a sweeper in the World Cup in 1982
in Spain where Germany finished runner-up.

<HEADLINE> Keane Rejects Price Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Roy Keane has branded Manchester
United's decision to blame his wage increase for the hike in
season ticket prices as "a stupid mistake".
</P>
<P>
The club sent a letter to fans claiming one of the reasons for
the ticket increase was the United captain's wage rise - to 52,000
pounds a week - which made sure he stayed at Old Trafford and did
not leave under the Bosman ruling.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not one for holding grudges but this was a stupid mistake,
a bad public relations exercise and something that should never
have happened," Keane is quoted as saying in The Sunday People.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still waiting for my apology but I could be waiting a long
time. The board have tried to explain what they meant, that it was
part of a wider picture of trying to keep the fans informed,
telling them the club wanted to rebuild and strengthen, which is
why prices were going up," said the captain.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is nobody should be singled out in a letter. It wasn'
t right. I felt everything was being laid at my door," he added.
</P>
<P>
United fans were also given a boost on Sunday, however, with
the news that manager Alex Ferguson is reportedly keen to stay on
at the English champions when his contract expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
It was previously thought Ferguson - who arrived at Old
Trafford in 1986 - would walk away from the club to make way for a
new man.
</P>
<P>
But, according to the News of the World newspaper, Ferguson is
far from keen to end his United career.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to stay here after my current two years are up," he
is quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If it is time to move on I have no problem with that. But it
would be nice to play some part and to remain attached to this
club," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said at the beginning of the year he planned to remain
active in the game after his time as United coach and could take
up some consultancy work.
</P>

<P>
CANBERRA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The start of the Olympic beach
volleyball stadium construction suffered a setback on Monday as
more than 100 protesters frustrated police and disrupted work on
Bondi Beach.
</P>
<P>
Around 100 police were at the site as the protest began with
scuffles when demonstrators tried to scale building equipment,
including a bulldozer and two trucks.
</P>
<P>
Police apprehended two protesters who were hindering the
erection of temporary fencing around the proposed construction
site.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, led by the residents group Bondi Olympic Watch,
vowed to continue hindering work until the Sept. 15 Olympic
opening ceremony if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Protesters are demonstrating against possible environmental
damage to the beach, lack of access plus public safety concerns
during construction.
</P>
<P>
The construction on the 10,000 seat temporary stadium was
scheduled on May 1 but delayed to avoid clashes with protesters.

<HEADLINE> China Wins Mixed Doubles in Asian Table Tennis (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- With its top players staying at home,
China failed to prove its domination in table tennis on Sunday as
its players won only one out of the three doubles finals in the
Asian Table Tennis tournament which opened here last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the mixed doubles final, which was followed by the women's
and men's doubles finals, China's Yan Sen, world No. 22 men player,
and Yang Ying, who is ranked the 11th in women's world list, had
almost lost the match to South Korea's Kim Taek Soo and Lee Eun
Sil before they staged a comeback in the last moment to collect
the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
The two pairs finished their first two sets in a draw. But a 20-
18 advantage in Korea's favor in the third set offered the Chinese
duo no choice but fighting decisively.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese players were lucky enough to score four straight
points to defeat their Korean counterparts 22-20 in the last set.
</P>
<P>
But South Korea actually secured the women's doubles title
after its two pairs -- Ryu Ji Hye, world No. 6, and Kim Moo Kyo,
world No. 30, and Lee Eun Sil and Suk Eun Mi-- eliminated in the
semifinals respectively China's Yang Ying and Sun Jin, and Song Ah
Sim and Kwok Fong Fong of Hong Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
Lee Eun Sil and Suk Eun Mi beat Ryu and Kim 2-1 to retain the
gold medal for South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Peng-Lung and Chang Yuan-Su from Chinese Taipei proved
themselves the best men's duo in this tournament after they took
an easy victory in the doubles final against Cheung Yuk and Leung
Chu Yan of Hong Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
Men's and women's singles finals, the last two events of the
championships, are scheduled on Monday evening before the closing
of the six-day Asian tournament.

<HEADLINE> Dead Shark Found in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A nine-meter-long dead shark, the
largest of its kind ever found in China, was recently spotted at
the Yantian Harbor in Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
When the three-ton shark was dragged into Yantian Harbor by a
cargo ship registered in Panama on Friday, it was already dead. A
post-mortem examination showed it was a whale shark, the largest
fish species in the world.
</P>
<P>
As the shark's lower back was wounded with a broken lower jaw,
a marine expert estimated that the shark suffered a serious injury
before it was spotted by the cargo ship.
</P>
<P>
The shark will be on display at the Shenzhen Ocean World.

<HEADLINE> Hope Project to Aid Children of Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hope Project, a national
charity that helps young dropouts in poor areas return to school,
is now shifting its focus from villages to cities as more children
of laid-off workers have had to abandon their studies.
</P>
<P>
Anshan City in northeast China's Liaoning Province, home to
China's steel giant Anshan Iron and Steel Co., has successfully
launched a project targeting children of local laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The Hope Project in Anshan has built 73 primary schools, 50
libraries and helped over 6,500 children return school with
donations of more than 10 million yuan in recent years, said Wang
Anping, head of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) Anshan
Branch.
</P>
<P>
"The Hope Project now will focus on school-age children of laid-
off workers who are forced to drop out because of their parents'
poor economic condition," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this new focus will help the children
return to school and allow parents to turn their full attention to
finding employment.
</P>
<P>
The Hope Project was initiated in 1990 by the China Youth
Development Fund under the CYLC. It has received over 1.78 billion
yuan (about 214 million U.S. dollars) in donations and sent 2.29
million children back to school over the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Nantes Edges Calais in French Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Titleholders Nantes converted a
controversial last minute penalty to beat fourth division side
Calais 2-1 in the final of the French Cup on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Playmaker Antoine Sibierski scored the winner from the spot
after substitute Alain Caveglia went down theatrically in a
counter-attack that brought the penalty.
</P>
<P>
Calais, who beat two first division sides including 1999 league
champions Girondins Bordeaux on their way to the final, went ahead
through winger Jerome Dutitre on 34th minute.
</P>
<P>
Sibierski brought the first division side back into the game
five minutes after the interval when the playmaker shot home from
close to the penalty spot.
</P>
<P>
It was Nantes' third victory in eight Cup finals, all against
teams from lower divisions. It followed their 1-0 win over Sedan
last year, also settled with a penalty, and a triumph over AJ
Auxerre 20 years earlier.

DeHaven, 33, won in 2 hours 15 minutes 30 seconds but failed to
reach the Olympic qualifying standard of 2:14.

The failure means he will be the only runner to represent the

Moroccan-born Khalid Khannouchi, holder of the world best

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has
sacked State Minister Sadi Somuncuoglu for defying a party decision
on presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the request of Prime minister Bulent
Ecevit, reported the Anatolia News Agency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Somuncuoglu is the second state minister to be out of the
cabinet within a week. State Minister Mehmet Ali Irtemcelik, from
the Motherland Party, resigned from his post Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Somuncuoglu of the Nationalist Movement
Party (MHP) created anxiety by defying a party decision which
required him not to field a presidential candidate. But at midnight
on April 25, just minutes before the time for nominating candidates
ran out, he submitted his candidacy application.
</P>
<P>
The move has triggered assaults from other MHP deputies.
</P>
<P>
Since April 26, Delvet Bahceli, MHP chairman and deputy prime
minister of the tripartite coalition government, has repeatedly
asked Somuncuoglu to resign from his ministerial post. But as the
veteran politician showed no such an intention, Bahceli decided to
ask the prime minister to kick out Somuncuoglu.

JERUSALEM -- Due to the slow progress in the Israeli-Palestinian
final-status talks, it is impossible for the two sides to finalize
a framework agreement by May 30, Israeli Foreign Minister David

Levy made this remark in a cabinet meeting called by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, in which Barak briefed several cabinet

</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat met for two hours Sunday night in the West Bank
city of Ramallah to discuss ways to advance the peace process so as

BEIRUT -- Commander of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA)
Antoine Lahd has asked Lebanese President Emile Lahoud to grant a
general amnesty to all SLA members and asked for leniency on
himself.
</P>
<P>
Lahd made the appeal at a press conference Monday at the SLA
headquarters in Marge'youn, inside Israel's self-styled security
zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli withdrawal to the international borders will become
a definite reality whether through a peace deal or not, whether
through the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 or unilaterally,
Lahd said.
</P>
<P>
Under such a situation, the residents of the security zone find
themselves faced with three options, emigrate via Israel or stay as
refugees, surrender themselves to the Lebanese judiciary, or carry
weapons in defense of themselves, he pointed out, noting that the
majority prefers the latter option. (Lebanon-SLA-Pardon)

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) Antoine Lahd has asked Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud to grant a general amnesty to all SLA members and asked for
leniency on himself.
</P>
<P>
Lahd made the appeal at a press conference Monday at the SLA
headquarters in Marge'youn, inside Israel's self-styled security
zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli withdrawal to the international borders will become
a definite reality whether through a peace deal or not, whether
through the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 or unilaterally,
Lahd said.
</P>
<P>
Under such a situation, the residents of the security zone find
themselves faced with three options, emigrate via Israel or stay as
refugees, surrender themselves to the Lebanese judiciary, or carry
weapons in defense of themselves, he pointed out, noting that the
majority prefers the latter option.
</P>
<P>
"The best solution for all parties is to issue a general amnesty
on the lines of the 1991 pardon as the winner-loser formula is
unbearable in Lebanon," Lahd suggested.
</P>
<P>
"If it is necessary to please the malicious (Hezbollah
guerrillas) who issue certificates of patriotism and treason, the
President of the Republic can except from the amnesty the top of
pyramid in south Lebanon (Lahd himself) and charge him personally
responsible for the conflict," the SLA leader concluded.
</P>
<P>
On its part, Hezbollah group responded quickly to Lahd's appeal,
saying it is "a message written by Israeli fingers."
</P>
<P>
"It is an attempt to throw the south Lebanon file at the face of
the Lebanese state," said Hezbollah, or Party of God, which has
been spearheading a guerrilla war in south Lebanon to oust Israeli
troops from the country.
</P>
<P>
President Lahoud will never pardon the SLA, parliament member
from the al-Wafaa Resistance Bloc Ammar Mousawi told the Lebanese
Central News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The president has spelled out three possible fates for the SLA
members, expulsion together with Israeli troops, surrender to the
Lebanese authorities, or the same fate as their colleagues who were
killed by the Lebanese resistance groups, Mousawi underscored.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli state television announced Sunday evening
that the SLA will willingly disband itself against Israeli security
guarantees such as political asylum.
</P>
<P>
The SLA, armed and funded by Israel, has been helping Israeli
troops patrol a 15-kilometer-deep zone which Israeli carved out in
south Lebanon in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Under Lebanese law, SLA members could face death penalties for
treason and collaborating with Israel, although no one caught so
far has been executed.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Restore N.Irish Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary
Peter Mandelson said on Monday that the government will begin
moves to restore the Northern Ireland Assembly in the wake of the
IRA's statement offering to put its weapons beyond use.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the House of Commons, Mandelson said he was
preparing to move an order to restore the suspended assembly and
its executive by May 22.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson also said the two independent observers in the
decommissioning process, Cyril Ramaphosa, the former secretary
general of South Africa's African National Congress and the former
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, will visit Belfast next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The British government suspended the power-sharing Northern
Irish Assembly in February, saying the Irish Republican Army
showed no sign of arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
But in moving towards a return of its powers, Mandelson said he
was "hopeful and confident" that the "ultimate prize" of stable
government and unbreakable peace was within grasp.
</P>
<P>
The success of moves to restore the locally elected assembly by
May 22 will however depend heavily on the attitude of the Ulster
Unionist Party, which will meet to discuss the proposal before
that date.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson told MPs that he believed the statement released by
the IRA at the weekend was "reliable".
</P>
<P>
"I regard the IRA statement as a very significant development,"
he said. "For the first time there is a commitment to put weapons
completely and verifiably beyond use."
</P>
<P>
"There is a more clear cut assurance of IRA's peaceful
intentions that we have ever heard before," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government now hoped to take "substantial measures" to
normalize security arrangements by June 2001, the new deadline by
which both London and Dublin aim to secure full implementation of
the Good Friday Agreement signed on April 10,1998.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists ruling council is expected to discuss the
IRA offer at a special meeting on May 20, just two days before the
government plans to lift the suspension and re-establish the power-
sharing executive and assembly at Stormont.
</P>
<P>
The impasse between the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein over the
IRA's refusal to disarm led the government to suspend the
political institutions set up under the Good Friday Agreement.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition "Jews in Berlin" Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The exhibition of Berlin's Jews
during the Holocaust period from 1938 to 1945 opened Monday in
Berlin's new restored Synagogue.
</P>
<P>
Today is the 55th anniversary of the unconditional surrender
of Nazi Germany in World War II. A new exhibition about Berlin's
Jews will help German people to remember the painful lessons of
the wars.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder made a speech at the
opening ceremony of the exhibition: "The terrible legacy of Nazi
barbarity, rather than repressed or forgotten, must be remembered
and understood."
</P>
<P>
About the responsibility of the war, Schroeder said: "On May 8
we don't speak of a collective guilt of the German people, but we
must speak of its responsibility... for humanity and tolerance and
the responsibility for freedom."
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will be showed by filmed and taped oral
histories of Holocaust survivors. And the exhibition will continue
until August 20.
</P>
<P>
In September 1938 there were some 50 active synagogues in
Berlin, but during the Night of Broken Glass on November 9, 1938
Nazis burned and destroyed most of them.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80,000 of Berlin's Jews wanted to flee Germany before
the Second World War in September 1939, more than 55,000 Berlin's
Jews were killed by the Nazis during the wartime.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder stressed the importance of the exhibition by saying:
"It is a particularly appropriate way to preserve the historical
memory for those who have no personal recollection of it. As many
school-children as possible should visit it."
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's appeal came just in time because, according to a
new study by researchers of Cologne University, there are half of
all Germans aged between 14 and 18 who know nothing about
Auschwitz's concentration and extermination camp.
</P>
<P>
Scroeder also said that Germany will improve the relations
with the Jews. The German government and industry are ready to
begin compensation payments from a 10 billion mark (4.6 billion
dollar) fund to former slave and forced laborers in Nazi-occupied
Europe.

<HEADLINE> Drug Dealers in Colombia Earn a Lot: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, may 8 (Xinhua) -- Colombian drug dealers got, between
1982 and 1998, 2.29 billion U.S. dollars per year for the drug
they delivered abroad, according to a university's study center.
</P>
<P>
The amount is roughly equal to 6 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) of 1990, and 2.3 percent of the 1998s, said the
Economic Development Studies Center (EDSC) of the University of
the Andes in a report released Monday by the press.
</P>
<P>
According to the text, yearly income got from 1996 to 1998 by
the four main economic groups in the country amounting to 1.6
billion U.S. dollars was far inferior to the earnings of the drug
dealers.
</P>
<P>
Drug dealing income during the studied period is almost double
the amount of the whole coffee industry.
</P>
<P>
According to specialists, drug exterior deliveries have
negative effects in the economy, as contraband, land concentration,
destimulation of investments and alteration in the dollar price.
</P>
<P>
Contraband for money laundering, amounted to 1.40 billion U.S.
dollars a year, about 10.7 percent of all imports and 1.6 percent
of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is the strength of Colombian peso due to the
great supply of drug dollars. During the last decade the
revaluation affected industry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it brought an artificial and temporary growth in such
sectors as construction, stuck in serious crisis.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture was affected due to land property concentration.
The EDSC calculates that drug dealers own about 1 million hectares,
equal to 2.8 percent of the national territory and 5 percent of
all the land suitable for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The institution said that there are some 300,000 peasants
growing illegal crops, something negative, for this takes place
with violence and constant violations.
</P>
<P>
The government destines an elevate percentage of its budget to
fight drug dealing, something that affects finances and distracts
the attention on social obligations. The study points out that the
internal conflict costs the state 6 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Drugs have turned the country into one of the most violent in
the world, where corruption abounds and justice works precariously,
the EDSC said.

<HEADLINE> UK WPP To Purchase US Advertising Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- UK advertising company WPP Group has
announced plans to buy its U.S. rival Young &AMP;Rubicam for more than
5.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The move announced Monday would create the world's largest
advertising company and would see the takeover of one of the last
few remaining independent agencies.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said Young &AMP; Rubicam's board had agreed to the
deal in principle at a meeting on Sunday.The agreement will marry
the two companies' advertising,public relations and direct
marketing interests.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said that final details still needed to be
ironed out and the final agreement would be announced later in the
week.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the deal, WPP shareholders would get about
two-thirds of the combined company's equity, with Young &AMP; Rubicam
investors receiving the rest.
</P>
<P>
Although the deal still requires board approvals, James
Dougherty, an analyst from Prudential Securities, said:"It's a
perfectly natural deal for these two companies."
</P>
<P>
"WPP wants to be the biggest marketing and advertising agency
in the world, so from their perspective, it's a natural deal by a
lot," he added.

UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and the European Commission have
launched two new publications produced under the auspices of their
joint Poverty and Environment Initiative, the UNDP said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The publications, "Attacking Poverty While Improving the
Environment: Towards Win-Win Policy Options" and "Attacking
Poverty While Improving the Environment: Practical Recommendations,
" summarize the findings of a meeting of the Forum of Ministers on
Poverty and Environment held last September in New York.
</P>
<P>
The two publications highlight six strategies for promoting "
win-win" outcome when addressing poverty and environment
challenges.
</P>
<P>
These includes: protecting and expanding the current asset
base of the poor; co-managing and co-investing resources with the
poor; promoting infrastructure and technology development that
meets the needs of the poor; compensating the poor for
environmental improvements; and reforming markets and planning.
</P>
<P>
The international community has long recognized that problems
related to poverty and the environment are inextricably linked.

</P>
<P>
"The agreement to bring China into the WTO is the product of
more than 13 years of tough negotiations conducted by four
administrations, Democratic and Republican," Ford, Carter and Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
"We urge Congress to embrace this agreement and to bring its
benefits home by voting for PNTR," they said.
</P>
<P>
The former presidents warned that failure to grant China
permanent normal trade relations status would "squander" the best
opportunity the United States has had in a generation to address
long-standing concerns about China's trading practices.
</P>
<P>
They also said it would improve U.S.-China relations, make
positive change within China more likely by opening doors to the
information revolution and speeding up reforms.
</P>
<P>
"A vote against PNTR will make it far more difficult to attain
these critical goals," the presidents said. "It would encourage
deeper tensions between Beijing and Taiwan and diminish our
ability to work for Asian stability."
</P>
<P>
Their letter is expected to give a boost to Clinton
administration's effort to lobby for passage of PNTR bill ahead of
a Congress vote in the week of May 22.
</P>
<P>
"The endorsement of three former presidents should have a
significant impact on members who are trying to make up their mind,
" White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Presidents Ford and Carter will visit the White House Tuesday
with former secretaries of state and national security advisers to
rally support for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in a letter
to House Banking and Financial Services Chairman James Leach, a
Republican from Iowa, also endorsed the passage of the legislation,
saying that it was "in the interests of the United States."
</P>
<P>
"Our markets are already generally open to China and that will
not be altered (by the China trade bill)," Greenspan wrote.
</P>
<P>
He said passage of the bill to normalize trade relations with
China "will facilitate a further opening of China's markets to U.S.
producers."

<HEADLINE> OPEC Improves Enforcement of Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The enforcement of the agreement
signed by the OPEC to balance the market "has improved" since last
March, said the president of the organization, Venezuelan Minister
of Energy Ali Rodriguez, Monday.
</P>
<P>
The execution fell during the first three months of the year,
Rodriguez said, calculating that the market received 1.2 billion
additional barrels of oil during this period.
</P>
<P>
"When there is an offer excess, obviously prices fall," the
president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (
OPEC) told the press.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that "any non-fulfilment is dangerous" because
problems can result for every party.
</P>
<P>
"This has improved according to market indicators."
</P>
<P>
The OPEC decided in March to increase its oil production by 1.7
million oil barrels per day (bpd) with the aim of generating a
price decrease, whose high levels threatened to shatter the world
economy, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The decision to increase oil supply took place before the
application, between the end of 1998 and march 2000, of a strategy
of production reduction by the OPEC to strengthen prices, which
had reached a historical low in almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC president said that one of his tasks is to follow up
the market to, in case any member does not abide by what was
agreed, proceed to call its attention.
</P>
<P>
The minister also defended the step taken by the OPEC in March
to set a range of prices with a minimum of 22 dollars per barrel
and a maximum of 28 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The scheme allows for Rodriguez, according to the tendency of
the market, to authorize a increase or a reduction of oil supply
in 500,000 barrels a day.

<HEADLINE> Germany Says Europe Needs Unifying Stand on U.S. NMD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Obviously, this national decision of the United States will
have a strong impact on the interests, security of all Europeans,"
Fisher told reporters after meeting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Fisher said the European allies of the United States are "
working very hard to coordinate" with both the U.S. and themselves
on the NMD issues.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration will decide whether to deploy an
anti-missile defense system later this year, a move which violates
the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty signed by Washington and
Moscow in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Washington needs to persuade Moscow to change the treaty. The
Russian government, strongly opposing to the deployment of NMD,
has rejected changes to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Some European allies are also critical of the NMD.
</P>
<P>
Albright said Clinton has not yet made a decision as to whether
to deploy NMD and will continue discussions with allies and Russia.
"He is going to be doing it according to four criteria, which is
the threat, the feasibility of the system, the cost and its effect
on the arms control regimes generally."
</P>
<P>
Albright reiterated that the purpose of NMD is to protect the
United States from any missile attack from "rogue" states. The
Europeans believe that they also face the same threat.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there is a discussion everywhere in Europe about
that, and we are looking forward in unifying the position," Fisher
said.

<HEADLINE> Greek Military Chief Opposes Economic Pressure on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos Monday expressed his opposition to the use of
Balkan reconstruction as a weapon of political pressure on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable to use the policy of Balkan reconstruction
in order to solve a country's internal problems," Tsohatzopoulos
said in an address to the Balkan Business Forum in the northern
Greek city of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
He stated that Yugoslavia's internal problem was a problem of
democratization and it concerned the Yugoslavs themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Balkan Stability Pact's Coordinator Bodo Hombach said at
the forum that Serbs should get rid of President Slobodan
Milosevic if they wanted to enjoy the fruits of reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Hombach's such statement, the Greek minister
said that it was inconceivable for anyone to consider holding
security and development in the Balkans hostage in an attempt to
single Yugoslavia out.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Minimum Wage Increase to be Positive to Stock Market: Analyst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian stockbrokers have commended
the federal government for paying workers in the country a "living
wage", saying it will facilitate the rapid growth of the economy
if other macro- economic variables are fine-tuned.
</P>
<P>
The brokers, in separate interviews, told reporters Monday in
Lagos that the variables included good governance, conclusive
privatization of state- owned companies, support for the organized
private sector and diversification of the economy.
</P>
<P>
An African analyst of the Japan-based Sito securities explained
that with the increase of national minimum wage, announced by
President Olusegun Obasanjo last week, workers would now have more
disposable income which they could buy shares of listed companies.
</P>
<P>
However, the delay in the implementation of budget 2000 was
affecting stock market activities, he said, adding the stock
market could not grow above the current limit as robust stock
market activities were a function of economic policies and
direction.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the federal government's continued control of
more than 90 percent of the economy and the privatization of
state-owned companies outside the stock market had made it
difficult for the market to grow.
</P>
<P>
The poor savings habit of the people would change if the
government patronized the stock market and made investment returns
on its bonds competitive and attractive, added the analyst.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Libya has pledged to cancel
part of Tanzania's 46 million U.S. dollar debt and change the
remaining amount for investment in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Finance Daniel Yona said here on Monday
that the decision was made during the first meeting of a permanent
joint commission established in Tripoli, Libya early this month.
</P>
<P>
"The principal amount was 46 million U.S. dollars which was
borrowed in 1983," the minister said, adding that "the accumulated
interest amount which Libya said might be frozen would be sorted
out later by the two parties."
</P>
<P>
According to Yona, who had just returned from a visit to Europe
and northern Africa with a delegation led by Tanzanian Minister
for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Jakaya Kikwete,
the cooperation in other sectors was also identified during the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
These include agriculture, industries, tourism, education,
culture and transport, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan government also pledged to fund the construction of
a 350- kilometer all weather road linking southern Lindi region to
Dar es Salaam and offer 25 scholarships to help train Tanzanians
in various skills, Yona said.
</P>
<P>
"A team of experts are expected to arrive in Dar es Salaam this
month from Libya to finalize the terms and conditions for the
Lindi-Kibiti road loan," he added.

<HEADLINE> IMF Completes Final Review of Thai Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (
IMF) on Monday completed the ninth, and final review under
Thailand's Stand-By Arrangement, which expires on June 19, 2000.
</P>
<P>
After Thailand was hit by the Asian financial crisis nearly
three years ago, the IMF approved a financing package totaling 17.
2 billion U.S. dollars to help the government to deal with
difficulties in repaying external debts. Of the amount, 14.3
billion dollars were drawn by the Thai government.
</P>
<P>
Given the improved balance of payments position, the Thai
authorities have not drawn under the arrangement since June 1999,
the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
"Executive directors commended the Thai authorities on the
considerable achievements they have made under the Fund-supported
program," said Stanley Fischer, IMF's first deputy managing
director.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the objectives of the program have by now been met
to a considerable extent, noting that economic recovery is
underway and an on-going reform strategy is in place to address
weaknesses in the institutional framework and facilitate corporate
debt and bank restructuring.
</P>
<P>
However, Fischer said the Thai government's macroeconomic
policy should continue to be set to support economic recovery for
the near term.
</P>
<P>
Over the medium term, the key challenge will be to sustain
economic recovery in the context of a heavily indebted corporate
sector and continued weaknesses in Thailand's financial system,
Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF will continue to monitor developments in Thailand in
the post-program phase," he said.

<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Slovak President Rudolf Schuster
said here Monday that he was in favor of lifting the sanctions
imposed on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his separate talks with his Greek counterpart,
Costis Stephanopoulos, and Prime Minister Costas Simitis, Schuster
said that he favored the lifting of sanctions because they had
produced the opposite results of those desired.
</P>
<P>
As for the Slovak-Greek ties, Schuster said that the relations
between the two countries were on the path of development.
</P>
<P>
He said that the exchange of views with Greek leaders was a
valuable source of learning for the Slovak people in their country
's construction.
</P>
<P>
The Slovak president also praised Greece for its contribution

<HEADLINE> WFP Suspends Food Aid Operations in Parts of Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) Monday announced that it had suspended emergency
humanitarian assistance to needy people in most parts of Sierra
Leone where the security situation has considerably deteriorated
in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Due to the hostage-taking situation and subsequent fighting,
WFP was forced to halt food deliveries and distributions to more
than 43,000 internally displaced people, orphans and hospital
patients in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
It has suspended food deliveries to 26,000 school children and
some 40,000 hungry people in Kambia, Lunsar, Makeni and Magburaka.
</P>
<P>
The aid agency has also postponed food distributions to
farmers in the districts of Bombali, Tonkolili and Kailahun. The
food was destined to feed 110,000 people during the rainy season,
known as the "hungry season," which is about to start in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
"We had to curtail some of our most vital operations in those
areas due to the high security risk our staff are facing there,"
said Paul Ares, WFP's regional manager for West African coastal
countries. "As a precaution, we have also redeployed most of our
staff in Conakry, in neighboring Guinea."
</P>
<P>
However, WFP is still continuing food aid distributions in
areas where security conditions are relatively stable.
</P>
<P>
As the food aid arm of the United Nations system, WFP is the
largest multinational food aid organization in the world,
responsible for handling around 3 million tons food aid.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1963, WFP's mandate is to help poor people in
developing countries by combating world hunger and poverty.

<HEADLINE> Germany Says Europe Needs Unifying Stand on U.S. NMD (with corrected name spelling) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Obviously, this national decision of the United States will
have a strong impact on the interests, security of all Europeans,"
Fischer told reporters after meeting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the European allies of the United States are "
working very hard to coordinate" with both the U.S. and themselves
on the NMD issues.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration will decide whether to deploy an
anti-missile defense system later this year, a move which violates
the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty signed by Washington and
Moscow in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Washington needs to persuade Moscow to change the treaty. The
Russian government, strongly opposing to the deployment of NMD,
has rejected changes to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Some European allies are also critical of the NMD.
</P>
<P>
Albright said Clinton has not yet made a decision as to whether
to deploy NMD and will continue discussions with allies and Russia.
"He is going to be doing it according to four criteria, which is
the threat, the feasibility of the system, the cost and its effect
on the arms control regimes generally."
</P>
<P>
Albright reiterated that the purpose of NMD is to protect the
United States from any missile attack from "rogue" states. The
Europeans believe that they also face the same threat.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there is a discussion everywhere in Europe about
that, and we are looking forward in unifying the position,"
Fischer said.
