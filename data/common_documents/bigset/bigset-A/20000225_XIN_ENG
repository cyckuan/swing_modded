<HEADLINE> Former UK PM Foresees Changes in World Trade Pattern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Former British Prime
Minister John Major said here Thursday that the world's trade
patterns may undergo dramatic changes in about 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech entitled "The Changing World" at the Third
Presidents Forum organized by the Business Week, Major said Russia,
Brazil, Indonesia, India and China -- the five countries owning
one half of the labor force of the entire world -- currently have
only one-third of the world trade that the European Union (EU) has.
</P>
<P>
Within 25 years, however, those five countries will double at
least their share of the world trade, "not double the share of the
world trade they have now, but double their share of enhanced
world trade,"he stressed.
</P>
<P>
And the five countries will have one and a half times as much
of their share of the world trade as the EU has, Major added.
</P>
<P>
"That will change trade patterns quite dramatically," he said,
noting that trade patterns may be very different in 25 years' time
from those people are familiar with today.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Major also said the World Trade Organization,
with the possible inclusion of more countries like China and Saudi
Arabia, will continue to liberalize trade and remove trade
barriers.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the next few years policy-makers may look at
the possibility of linking or merging the great free trade area of
western Europe and the great free trade area of NAFTA (North
America Free Trade Agreement).
</P>
<P>
The Presidents Forum has brought together about 200 business
leaders from Southeast Asia to examine growth strategies for
companies as the region begins its recovery process.
</P>
<P>
The forum, which opened here on Wednesday, is scheduled to
close on Friday.

<HEADLINE> HK to Activate Government Center to Monitor Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will activate the Y2K
Central Coordinating Center (CCC) to monitor the territory-wide
situation during the rollover to February 29, which is a Y2K
critical date.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting
Jessie Ting, who is also the controller of the CCC, said Thursday
that the government would adopt the same territory-wide
coordinating and emergency response mechanism as the rollover to
January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The CCC will be activated from the evening on February 28,"
Ting said. "It will closely monitor the rollover situation in the
territory and will, if necessary, coordinate responses to any
unforeseen Y2K induced incidents with cross-sector implications."
</P>
<P>
The center will be manned by officers from the concerned
bureaux and departments, including the Information Technology and
Broadcasting Bureau, the Security Bureau, the Information
Technology Services Department, the Office of the
Telecommunications Authority and the Electrical and Mechanical
Services Department.
</P>
<P>
To coincide with the activation of the CCC, the 13 sector-wide
coordinating centers covering various essential services will also
come into operation. They cover aviation, border control,
broadcasting, energy supply, environment, fire and emergency
services, financial services, food supply, port management, public
health, public order, telecommunications and transport.
</P>
<P>
These sector-wide centers are responsible for coordinating
emergency responses to Y2K-induced incidents within their
respective sectors.
</P>
<P>
They will also maintain close contact with the CCC and report
to it on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
Ting noted that both the government and the essential service
providers had made comprehensive preparations to ensure a smooth
rollover to Y2K critical dates.
</P>
<P>
"The public have reacted sensibly to the challenge posed by the
Y2K problem during the rollover to January 1. I appeal to the
public to adopt the same attitude for the upcoming rollover to
February 29," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ting also urged businesses to make necessary preparations to
ensure a smooth rollover to February 29.
</P>
<P>
The Marine Department has asked ship masters, owners agents and
vessel operators to pay special attention to the Y2K problem and
to take heed of the special port operations procedures to be
implemented on the coming two Y2K high-risk days of February 29
and March 1.
</P>
<P>
On February 28 and 29, from 20:00 to 01:00 the following day,
and on February 29 and March 1, from 07:00 to 09:00, all vessels
must carry out proper tests before entering Hong Kong waters or
getting under way within port to ensure normal functioning of
their ship-board equipment and report their situation to the
Vessel Traffic Center, said a spokesman for the Marine Department
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The computer systems with Y2K problems may take the year of
2000, a leap year, as the year of 1900, thus ignoring the date of
February 29 and causing malfunction.
</P>
<P>
Y2K critical dates include March 31, October 10 and December 31
of this year and January 1 and December 31 of next year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Lights Fuse of Decisive War  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda, an East African
country where AIDS has since 1982 claimed as many as 500,000
lives, has lit the fuse of a decisive battle against the killer
disease on Thursday by mapping out a five-year anti-AIDS strategy.
</P>
<P>
The release of the National Strategic Framework for HIV/AIDS
Activities in Uganda 2000-2005 in Entebbe marks another monument
in the country's painstaking crusade against the so-called "skin
disease".
</P>
<P>
It will serve as a guiding document in its final blows to knock
the disease down and out.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks of a two-day workshop in the Imperial
Botanical Hotel, Uganda AIDS Commission (UAC) Director Kihumuro
Apuuli said the document had identified the top priority areas in
the field and come up with valuable recommendation.
</P>
<P>
In the document, prevention, mitigation, capacity building,
harmonized coordination and information sharing are listed as key
measures to be taken to reduce by 25 percent the already declining
national infection rate, to expand voluntary counseling and
testing services nationwide and to boost economic development by
relieving the most productive group of the labor force of the
pains inflicted by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
At the function, Apuuli acknowledged that the country has paid
a dear price for AIDS.
</P>
<P>
One decade ago, more than 25 percent of Ugandan adults were
living with HIV/AIDS, leading to untimely death of young
bread-earners in many poor families. High prevalence of HIV/AIDS
has become one of the key causes for widespread poverty.
</P>
<P>
Children are the most innocent group to suffer from AIDS. As
of now, 1. 9 million Ugandan children have been orphaned by AIDS.
Most of these kids, with no access to education and labor skills,
have turned into street kids and may constitute the biggest
potential threat to social stability.
</P>
<P>
Army is another suffering group, Apuuli said. Although the
number of AIDS victims in the army is not available at the
workshop, he said, but one thing is sure: AIDS has killed more
Ugandan soldiers than war itself.
</P>
<P>
He said that soldiers, who constitute the most sexually active
age group, are most likely to fall prey to the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
It is against this bleak background that the Ugandan government
has designed the five-year plan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has scored commendable achievements in fighting against
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Among the many factors contributing to the dramatic decline of
HIV/AIDS prevalence in the country over the past few years, the
openness policy pursued by the government has played a central
role.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to raise public awareness, the government has
resorted to all kinds of ways and means to address the serious
AIDS situation the country faces.
</P>
<P>
It has promulgated some 50 relevant laws and regulations to
curb the spreading of the disease and opened dozens of counseling
centers at district level.
</P>
<P>
These efforts paid off at last. The national HIV infection rate
has dropped from over 25 percent in 1992 to the present 10
percent, making it the sole sub-Sahara country with the declining
HIV trend.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Uganda has often been cited as a success story in
the region in combating HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
However, Apuuli said, although Uganda has covered most of the
uphill trek of fighting AIDS, it still has a long way to go. The
newly released 69- page framework would guarantee their final
success, he said.

<HEADLINE> Germany Hopes Koch-Weser will be New IMF Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The German government said
Thursday it hopes its candidate Caio Koch-Weser will succeed in
getting the position of the managing director of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) despite the candidates from Japan and the
United States compete with him for the job.
</P>
<P>
A Finance Ministry spokeswoman said that Germany hoped Deputy
Finance Minister Caio Koch-Weser would get the formal support from
the European Union finance ministers at their meeting next Monday.
</P>
<P>
There was a conflict between Germany and France about the
nomination of the managing director of IMF. The United States has
pledged to support the European candidate and Germany hoped the U.
S. would insist on supporting the German candidate.
</P>
<P>
55-year-old Caio Koch-Weser had been a top official at the
World Bank for many years, but the U.S. has questioned his
qualification for the job as head of the IMF and some Washington
officials were questioning whether Koch-Weser was able to lead
much larger IMF.
</P>
<P>
During the World Economic Forum from January 27 to February 1
in Davos, Switzerland, Caio Koch-Weser indicated in interviews
that he was expecting to gain the post.
</P>
<P>
Besides Koch-Weser and Stanley Fischer, Japan has nominated
its former Deputy Finance Minister Eisuke Sakakibar for the IMF
top position, but he has little chance, according to Financial
Times Deutschland.
</P>
<P>
European Union finance ministers also showed their approval to
Caio Koch-Weser for the managing director of the IMF, according to
sources from EU on Friday.The EU finance ministers will meet on
Monday in Brussels and give approval at the meeting. The EU
foreign ministers had already fundamentally supported Koch-Weser
at their meeting on February 14.

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemns U.S. Non-Proliferation Bill on Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bill stipulates U.S. financial and economic sanctions
against foreign citizens and organizations, including Russian, if
there is "trustworthy information" that they are violating the
regime of non-proliferation of missile and nuclear technologies to
Iran. The U.S. House of Representatives had passed a very similar
bill last September.
</P>
<P>
Such law-making "delivers a serious blow to bilateral and
international cooperation in nonproliferation and export control
and the enforcement of such legislation and especially any steps
to apply it in practice will undermine the legal foundation of
such cooperation, complicate Russian-American relations and
international relations as a whole," the Russian Foreign Ministry
said in a Friday statement.
</P>
<P>
It described the bill as an attempt to pressure Russia and
other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it should be recognized that American
legislators again artificially exacerbate the situation, try to
give an extraterritorial nature to an act of domestic legislation
and exert pressure on foreign countries on a clearly invented
pretext," it reads.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's principled stance on the matter remains unchanged --
such a pseudo- imperial approach is impermissible and will not be
accepted," the statement says.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov also expressed disapproval
of the U.S. bill. He told a Friday press conference in Moscow that
the U.S. Senate's passage of this bill "could complicate even
further the solution of a whole host of issues in Russian-U.S.
bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
"In all likelihood, we will discuss this with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright at a meeting in Lisbon (Portuguese
capital) in early March, even though we had planned a somewhat
different agenda," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov expressed his
doubts Friday that the U.S. bill to impose sanctions on a third
country for sales of military technology to Iran would ever become
law, even though the U.S. Congress passed it on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the bill owed its existence primarily to the
current presidential election campaign in the United States,
saying "this decision by the U.S. Congress is unlikely to have any
practical effect on Russia."

<HEADLINE> Russia to Set Up Administration, Revive Economy in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Security Council,
the country's top security policy agency, Friday made a decision
to establish interim administration in coming days and to restore
economy in the liberated parts of the rebel republic of Chechnya
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Russian Central Election Commission Chairman Alexander
Veshnyakov plans to visit Chechnya to acquaint himself with the
preparations for the March 26 Russian presidential elections in
the republic, Security Council Secretary Sergei Ivanov said after
Friday's council session chaired by Acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
In coming two weeks the government will complete the
preparation for a measure program on restoring the power
structures and the social and economic sectors in Chechnya, Ivanov
predicted.
</P>
<P>
To organize new power structures, "a transitional period will
be required, since now it is unrealistic to set up in Chechnya
republican power similar to that in other federal territories,"
Ivanov said, noting that he regards this as "an issue for long-
term discussion."
</P>
<P>
According to Ivanov, the power bodies existing in Chechnya in
the latest nine years were "absolutely illegal" and "there can be
no talk of any specific zones or closed territories" in Chechnya.
The interim administration to be formed in the republic soon "will
in many ways take upon itself the functions of a federal center."
</P>
<P>
It is expected that "as an interim body of power, a three-way
structure will be established to provide the republic's
administration, appointed by the federal center," Russian Deputy
Prime Minister Nikolai Koshman told the press following the Friday
session.
</P>
<P>
A decision has been adopted to deliver Chechen oil to Russia
for sale and to return the earnings to Chechnya for its social and
economic restoration, said Ivanov.

member since the country's independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
When he was National Housing and Construction Minister, he was
embroiled in a housing scandal which involved diverting money
meant for developing low-income houses to extending the houses of
his political cronies, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
His resignation came soon after Mugabe said any of his
relatives who might be implicated in the National Oil Company of
Zimbabwe scandal would have to face the wrath of the law.
</P>
<P>
The oil company is chocking from a nine billion Zimbabwean
dollars (236 million U.S. dollars) debt accrued through the
under-pricing of fuel and the corruption of top company and
government officials.

<HEADLINE> PNA Official: Prospects of Peace Talks Resumption to be Determined Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
GAZA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- It is to be decided next Sunday
whether the stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace talks will be resumed
or not, said Nabil Abu-Rodinah, adviser to Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side received some U.S. and Israeli suggestions
on the resumption of the peace talks and will respond within the
coming 72 hours, Abu-Rodinah told reporters on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The results of the U.S. efforts and contacts will be declared
by Sunday, he added.
</P>
<P>
The PNA's senior official was quoted on Friday by Al-Ayam daily
as saying Arafat will meet U.S. coordinator of the Middle East
peace process Dennis Ross on Sunday for the third time in one week
after the former's return from Egypt on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Abu-Rodinah added after Arafat's meeting with Ross last
midnight the continuous U.S. effort has failed so far to yield
positive results.
</P>
<P>
Ross did not bring anything new to Arafat, Abu-Rodina said,
pointing out that without effective U.S. pressure, the peace talks
will never get out of their crisis. He deemed the remaining 72
hours of Ross's tour of the region "crucial."
</P>
<P>
The coming hours will determine the fate of Ross's mission, he
asserted.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side is, according to Abu-Rodinah, waiting for
a clear-cut Israeli position on the redeployment issues and the
talks on a permanent peace treaty before September, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ross said after his meeting with Arafat that
Washington will intensify its efforts to overcome the three-week
stalemate of the Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat is scheduled to continue his consultations
with the Palestinians and Israelis separately on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Liberals Sustain Political Damage: Pollsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Liberal government
appears to have sustained a month-long barrage about mismanagement
of job-creation programs, the Ottawa Citizen reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing the country's Ekos poll conducted in November, the
report said that the Transitional Jobs Fund (TJF) and other
government job-creation projects remained "a strong first choice"
among the 1,505 respondents.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent approved of extra funds going to job creation,
compared with 59 percent for health care and education, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Results of an Angus Reid poll conducted in January pegged the
Liberals with 46 percent support, ahead of the Tories at 15
percent and Reform at 12 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian pollsters say they are conducting a new round of
survey to
find if the Liberals have lost support as a result of the latest
development of what opposition parties call "Shovelgate scandal".
</P>
<P>
Oppositions are accusing the Human Resources Department of
creating"billion-dollar boondoggle" in distributing employment
expansion grants without supervision. They also charged the
government with misusing the grants to woo voters.
</P>
<P>
Canadian police were recently called in to investigate an
alleged"fraud" involving 100,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,740 U.
S. dollars)in federal grants at a government-funded project in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal government has denied the charges, saying that the
issue is limited to a small sum of money which is not missing and
that any over-granting can be retrieved.

</P>
<P>
He appealed to the churches and to the public to "win back the

<HEADLINE> Russia Cancels Planned FM Visit to Poland, Recalls Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov on Friday canceled his visit to Poland planned for March 3
and announced that the Russian ambassador to the country will be
recalled for consultations shortly.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a news conference in Moscow following
his talks with Alvaro Gil-Robles, the Council of Europe's human
rights commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov blamed the Polish leaders for the incident in Poznan,
Poland where Pro- Chechen protesters broke into the Russian consul
general's office and tore down and burned a Russian flag Wednesday.
They raised a Chechen flag over the consulate building,drew a
swastika on the wall of the consulate, claiming they are members
of the "Free Caucasus Committee". It was reported that Polish
police did not intervene.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Russian rallies were also held Wednesday before the
buildings of the Russian embassy in Warsaw and the Russian
consulates in Krakow and Gdansk.
</P>
<P>
What happened "could not but damage Russian-Polish bilateral
relations, in particular political contacts," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Europe has failed to respond to the thuggish
attack on the Russian consul general in Poznan, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on Gil-Robles to take a look at the human
rights violations against Russians in some European countries and
render his verdict.
</P>
<P>
The Russian State Duma, the lower house of the parliament on
Friday passed a statement demanding that the Polish authorities
thoroughly investigate the attack on the Russian consul general's
office in Poznan and bring the culprits to justice.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The UK economy will grow
robustly this year before slowing slightly next year, according to
the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
In its latest quarterly forecast, the CBI revised upwards its
previous estimates for economic growth, citing improved exports
for British companies helped by improved global demand.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said it had underestimated the growth in household
consumption, which would help drive total GDP growth to 3.1
percent this year, a revision of 0.2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
In a separate survey, the CBI said manufacturers' order books
were in their healthiest state for almost two years and there were
signs that firms would soon put up their prices.
</P>
<P>
The CBI expected interest rates, currently at 6 percent,to peak
at 6.25 percent rather than the 5.75 percent in its November
forecast.
</P>
<P>
Household consumption will grow 3.5 percent rather than 2.7
percent and underlying inflation will come in at 2.2 percent
rather than 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The CBI also revised its forecast for sterling, saying it would
be some 6 percent stronger by the end of this year than previously
thought.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing Home Sales Drop Sharply in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The existing home sales in
the United States dropped sharply in January, dragged lower by
rising mortgage rates, the National Association of Realtors
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Existing homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 4.59 million units in January, 10.7 percent below December's
rate of 5.14 million units. January's sales pace was the lowest
since a 4.39 million unit pace in November 1997 and marked the
largest plunge since a 12.5 percent drop in April 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Higher rates have caused the market to settle to a less hectic
pace," said Dennis Cronk, president of the National Association of
Realtors.
</P>
<P>
January's slower sales pace was 10 percent below the year-
earlier pace of 5.1 million units. The slower sales came as the
average commitment rate for the 30-year fixed rate mortgage rose
to 8.21 percent in January from 7.91 percent in December. It was 6.
79 percent in January of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The inventory of homes available dropped to 1.15 million units,
down a sharp 23 percent from December's 1.5 million units. At the
current sales pace, there was 3.0 months supply of homes available
on the market, a record low.
</P>
<P>
Despite the record low inventory levels, the median home price
fell in January to 132,200 U.S. dollars from 133,700 dollars in
the previous month. The mean home sales price remained steady at
168,800 dollars.

UNITED NATIONS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The improvement of

steady, a U.N. report said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report, submitted by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
said since January 1, 1999, the percentage of women on appointed
subject to geographical distribution increased from 37.7 percent

as compared to 905 women out of a total of 2,401 staff on
geographical appointments on December 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Although the rate of progress in improving women's overall
representation remains slow, headway has been made in improving
the representation of women at the senior and policy-making level,
the report said.
</P>

During 2000, priority will be assigned to the further
elaboration and implementation of gender action plans in

<HEADLINE> Italy to Allocate Aid to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Italy has allocated ten billion
lire (about 5.12 million U.S. dollars) for emergency aid for
Mozambique, half of which will be used immediately, and is working
for a meeting of the African nation's donor countries to be
scheduled for some time in March in Rome.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the Foreign Minister said Italy acted
quickly on a request for aid from Mozambique authorities and an
appeal delivered by the United Nations for the country's stricken
population.
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini decided on an
allocation of ten billion lire for the African country. Half of
these funds will be used for immediate emergency aid projects to
benefit the most vulnerable sectors of the population.
</P>
<P>
"Non-governmental agencies and Italian religious missions
operating in Mozambique will be involved in carrying out these
programs," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also reported that a plane with a cargo of
emergency relief items valued at 450 million lire ( about 231,000
U.S. dollars) has already reached the country and another flight
has been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The second plane will also carry an Italian Cooperation
Department expert who will direct the distribution and handling of
the relief items arriving.
</P>
<P>
The communique recalled that the new funds were earmarked in
the framework of a vast foreign aid program for Mozambique which
includes allocations for the current year of some 39 billion lire
(about 20 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> WHO Study on Heart Attack Shows Prevention, Treatment Both Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The latest results from a study
by the World Health Organization (WHO) show that heart disease
rates are related to changes in major coronary risk factors and to
the introduction of new medical treatments.
</P>
<P>
The results from the WHO MONICA Project, the largest community-
based study on heart disease ever undertaken, are published in the
United Kingdom medical journal, The Lancet, on February 26, WHO
said in a press release here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The project, an international collaboration of researchers from
21 countries, studied more than 30 populations, mainly from Europe,
over a period of ten years, from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
More than seven million men and women aged between 35 and 64
years of age were monitored to examine if and how certain coronary
risk factors and new treatments for heart disease contribute to
the decline or rise of heart disease rates in these communities.
</P>
<P>
The risk factors studied by the MONICA project included
cigarette smoking, blood pressure, blood cholesterol and body
weight. Treatments taken into consideration included aspirin, beta
blockers,ACE-inhibitors, thrombolytics (clot-busters) and coronary
artery surgery. All of these are known from other research studies
to determine risk or survival from heart disease in individuals.
</P>
<P>
Heart disease rates fell in most of the populations studied, as
did cigarette smoking in men, blood pressure and blood cholesterol.
Smoking in women showed a mixed picture and weight rose in both
men and women in most populations.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, most of the trends are moving in the right
direction. However, the increase in obesity, and in smoking among
women, requires immediate public health action.
</P>
<P>
Taking all populations as a whole, decline in smoking seems to
have contributed most to the reduction in the risk of heart
disease in men.In women, decrease in blood pressure emerged as the
strongest determinant.
</P>
<P>
As for medical treatment in the 1980s and in the 1990s, the
study shows that advances in medical treatment were also related
to heart disease rates and survival. However, improvements in
heart disease rates and treatment varied greatly across countries.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, the study clearly demonstrates that many of
the countries involved are approaching the problem appropriately
by combining strong preventive efforts with provision of essential
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
"In the light of shrinking resources for health care worldwide,
the preventive approach is the only way to stop the growing
epidemic and deal with the problem in future generations," said Dr
Ingrid Martin,head of the WHO Cardiovascular Diseases Program that
coordinates the MONICA project.
</P>
<P>
"This has implications especially in developing countries where
heart disease and stroke epidemics are rapidly advancing," she
added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Wants End to Diamond Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- South African Minerals and
Energy Minister Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said here on Friday that
her country wanted to see an end to the international boycott of
diamonds from war-torn areas, including some in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure we'll win this battle," she told a Mining Summit,
while calling on those who supported the boycott to help South
Africa and other developing diamond-producing countries.
</P>
<P>
International pressure groups have called for an embargo of
diamonds from war-ravaged countries such as Angola and Sierra
Leone to prevent rebels from running their war machine by
exporting diamonds.
</P>
<P>
Various options were being considered to enforce compliance
with the proposed boycott, including requiring certificates of
origin for all diamonds.
</P>
<P>
The South African diamond giant De Beers not only complied with
the United Nations' ban on diamonds from the rebel movement in
Angola, but decided not to buy any diamonds from Angola at all,
except for one contract it had to honor, De Beers officials
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Those stones were guaranteed to have been legitimately
produced, they said, adding that De Beers had also closed its
buying operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have buying operations anywhere in Africa," said
one official of De Beers.

<P>
MAPUTO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- As the level of the flood
waters in the Incomati Valley in Maputo Province drops, it has
been possible to star work on repairing Mozambique's main
north-south highway.
</P>
<P>
The flood cut the road in five separate places in Manhica
district, some 90 kilometers north of Maputo, Mozambique's
capital. Equipment from the Maputo, Gaza and Inhambane Road and
Bridge Construction and Maintenance Companies (ECMEPs) has been
moved into position. And the most northerly of the breaks in the
road has already been repaired, Mozambique News Agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Assuming that the flood waters continue to subside, emergency
repairs to the road, allowing traffic to resume, could be
concluded within a week.
</P>
<P>
The main road is also cut at Chicumbane, just outside Xai-Xai,
capital of Gaza Province.
</P>
<P>
There are also fears that the road will become impassable at
Vulanjane in Inhambane Province, because of heavy rains that have
been falling there, worsening by last Tuesday's passage of cyclone
Eline.
</P>
<P>
In the north of Inhambane, floods in the Save Valley have
isolated the town of Nova Mambone and the locality of Jofane from
the rest of the country.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The mining industry must
reinvent itself in terms of diversity, South African Minerals and
Energy Minister Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Despite big challenges, South Africa still has a world-class
mining industry and there are a lot of mineral resources such as
platinum and chrome to be exploited, she said.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa has to adopt new measures to attract
investors to exploit the mineral resource, both locally and
internationally.
</P>
<P>
"Diamonds and gold will still play a very important role in
export. Meanwhile, a dedicated strategy is needed for coal, which
had underperformed, especially in terms of export markets," the
minister said.

<P>
HARARE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Lands and
Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai said on Friday the government
needs to acquire at least five million hectares to resettle people
displaced by white settlers.
</P>
<P>
Kangai told participants to a one-day conference organized by
the Development Aid for People to People in Harare that the
objectives of the government were to distribute land equitably.
</P>
<P>
"The government alone can not resolve the land issue," he said.
"There is need for partners to assist if the resettlement program
is to improve the living standards of rural people."
</P>
<P>
"We value a number of contributions rendered by other
non-governmental organizations in this land re-distribution
program," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Danish-sponsored Development Aid for People to People

<HEADLINE> Cholera Outbreak Feared in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A major outbreak of cholera is
feared as a result of difficulties in obtaining clean drinking
water following the torrential rains and flooding that hit the
southern region of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Ten deaths from cholera have been reported in Beira, the
capital of the central province of Sofala, and at least three
cases of cholera have been diagnosed in the Mozambican capital
Maputo, Mozambique News Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Maputo city health director Olivia Perreira said that all three
 cases of cholera confirmed so far occurred outside the centers
where thousands of people rendered homeless by the floods have
been accommodated. They were reported from two suburbs that have
been inundated and where wells have been contaminated.
</P>
<P>
"For us to prevent a disastrous situation, similar to that of
two years ago, we are to start disinfecting the wells with
chlorine on Friday in all areas that we can reach," said Perreira.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of malaria and diarrhoea, Perreira said that the
number of cases is growing alarmingly, and the health authorities
are preparing to open a special ward for malaria in the Infulene
psychiatric hospital, on the outskirts of maputo.
</P>
<P>
She explained that the idea is to relieve the pressure on the
other health units, posed by the growing number of cases of this
disease.
</P>
<P>
"To this end, we are working with the Health Ministry to
strengthen the staff for that ward, because, besides the problem
of space, we are also facing difficulties of human resources,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
As for the necessary medicines, she said that there are enough
stocks both for cholera and for malaria.

<HEADLINE> Iran Slams U.S. for "Carrot and Stick" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani on Friday strongly slammed the United States for
adopting a "carrot and stick" policy toward Iran after the U.S.
Senate passed a bill to intensify sanctions on Iran.
</P>
<P>
The American officials are following the "dirty policy of the
carrot and the stick toward Iran," Rafsanjani said at a Friday
prayers congregation in response to the approved bill.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate on Thursday unanimously passed the bill designed
to punish Russia and any other countries if they supply nuclear,
biological or chemical weapon equipment or technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
But at the meantime, the U.S. Secretary of State Mandelaine
Albright renewed an offer to hold direct talks with Iran over U.S.
concerns with Iranian policies in order to improve the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
"We have been prepared for direct dialogue (with Iran),"
Albright said in her comments on the possible impact of the recent
Iranian parliamentary election on Washington-Tehran ties.
</P>
<P>
Iranian reformists, the main supporters of Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami, won a landslide victory in the polling last
Friday, giving hope for a rapprochement between the two arch foes.
</P>
<P>
As far as the Iranian policy is concerned, nothing will change
after the parliamentary polling, said Rafsanjani, the chairman of
Iran's powerful arbitrate and advisory State Expediency Council.
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, they say they want talks with Iran and on the
other hand they threaten us with their vote," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran sticks to its policy of detente, but will never
kneel down before the U.S., underling the U.S. must accept it has
made mistakes in its policies toward Iran and prove its good-will
toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. severed its diplomatic relations with Iran after
fervent Iranian students took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran in
the heydays of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Washington has repeatedly called for direct talks with Iran to
normalize relations between the two countries after President
Khatami adopted a detente foreign policy to improve Tehran's ties
with the outside world.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Angered by French PM's Remark Over Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss on Friday summoned the French ambassador in Beirut to complain
remarks by French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin who branded
Lebanon's anti-Israeli Hezbollah guerrillas as "terrorists."
</P>
<P>
Hoss, who is also foreign minister, compared the Iranian and
Syrian-backed Hezbollah, which is leading a guerrilla war against
Israeli occupation of South Lebanon, to the French resistance
movement against the Nazi occupation in World War II.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hezbollah called Jospin a "racist" whose position "
puts France in contradiction with its interests in Lebanon and the
Arab world."
</P>
<P>
Jospin, on the second day of his four-day visit in Jerusalem,
said Thursday "France condemns Hezbollah's attacks, and all types
of terrorist attacks which may be carried out against soldiers or
possibly Israel's civilian population."
</P>
<P>
In an early statement, Hoss expressed hope that France, "the
friend with which we have historic links," will renew its support
for Lebanon's resistance against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
"International laws and agreements have sanctioned the right of
people to resist occupation," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"If the aim is to preserve Israeli soldiers' lives, they have
only to leave Lebanon," it added.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese prime minister condemned as terrorism Israel's
occupation of Lebanese land and its bombing of civilian and
infrastructure targets in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jets destroyed three Lebanese power stations on February
8.
</P>
<P>
Terrorism is also embodied in "the persistent threats by
(Israeli) officials to burn Lebanese earth," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy made a controversial warning
Wednesday that Lebanese soil will "burn" if Hezbollah attacks
northern Israel and that Israel would retaliate "blood for blood...
child for child".
</P>
<P>
Hoss said in Beirut Thursday that "a minister like Levy is evil
and thoughts such as the ones he expressed Wednesday night prove he
is afflicted by racism and arrogance."

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Lashes Remarks of French PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's anti-Israeli guerrilla
group Hezbollah, which was termed by French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin as "terrorists," on Friday condemned Jospin's remarks as "
hostile and racist."
</P>
<P>
The remarks "went against the French principles as well as the
French interests in the Middle East," Hezbollah said.
</P>
<P>
Jospin, on the second day of his four-day visit in Jerusalem,
said Thursday "France condemns Hezbollah's attacks, and all types
of terrorist attacks which may be carried out against soldiers or
possibly Israel's civilian population."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said in statement that Jospin put France against its
own interests in Lebanon and the Arab world. Jospin's remarks go
against the French attempt to work out an unbiased Arab policy
independent from that of the United States, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Jospin's position breached the principles of an understanding
reached between Israel and Hezbollah in April 1996, which prohibits
attacks on or from civilian areas, it added.
</P>
<P>
France is a member of the committee monitoring the
implementation of the document. The committee also groups
representatives from the U.S., Syria, Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Jospin's immoral remarks undermine the French policy and
constitute a grave crime against the Arab-French ties," the
statement condemned, saying the remarks "proved Jospin's Jewish
origin."
</P>
<P>
France must correct the shameful remarks of its prime minister
who harmed seriously the Arab-French ties as well as the ethical
and humanitarian values, according to Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lebanese government has lodged an official
protest to France against Jospin's remarks.

<HEADLINE> European Commission President to Visit Israel on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Romano Prodi, president of
European Commission, is scheduled to arrive here on Sunday to hold
talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on the Mideast peace
process and EU-Israeli relations, Israeli Foreign Ministry
announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
As head of the top executive body of the European Union(EU),
Prodi will also, during his two-day visit, meet with President Ezer
Weizman, Foreign Minister David Levy and Regional Cooperation
Minister Shimon Peres, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
Prodi is expected to seek a bigger EU role in the Mideast peace
process and reiterate the EU's view that it has the right to play a
greater role in the process because its direct interests are linked
to Mideast peace, and it has considerable investment in the region,
diplomatic sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, a former Italian prime minister, will also discuss with
Israeli leaders ways to strengthen EU-Israeli relations, both
bilateral and in the framework of the EU-Mediterranean cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the last several years, the EU influence on the Mideast
peace process has been overshadowed by the chief Mideast peace
broker, the United States.
</P>
<P>
But it has recently tried to play a more active role in the
process, with the consideration that Israel is geographically
closer to Europe than to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Both the Israeli-Palestinian and Israeli-Syrian peace talks have
been stalled since January and the U.S., the EU and other peace-
makers are trying to help persuade the parties concerned to return
to the negotiating tables.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who is currently on a four-
day visit to the region, said here Thursday his country would do
whatever it can to ensure the success of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
France is ready to send peacekeeping forces to Lebanon in the
event of an Israeli-Syrian peace accord.
</P>
<P>
This will be Prodi's first visit to the region as the commission
president.

<HEADLINE> Flood Traps Residents in Australia's NSW State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Residents in flood-affected
areas of New South Wales (NSW) in southeast Australia could be
trapped on their properties for up to six weeks because of unsafe
roads, emergency authorities said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
As flood waters subsided with Friday's fine weather, a picture
of devastation spanning thousands of kilometers emerged over the
landscape.
</P>
<P>
State Emergency Services (SES) spokesman Rick Stone said the
freak weekend downpour which triggered the flood had damaged
unsealed roads, ripped up fences and caused the deaths of
thousands of stock.
</P>
<P>
The flooding was made worse by large volumes of water flowing
into the Paroo River system from the Queensland state in east
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Stone said 11 people who were evacuated at the height of the
emergency had returned home but many others were trapped on their
properties.
</P>
<P>
Emergency crews were focused on organizing food drops by air.
</P>
<P>
The SES had chartered a second helicopter from the National
Parks and Wildlife Service to speed up the distribution of
supplies, Stone said.
</P>
<P>
He said local crews estimated it would be six weeks before
flood waters had completely subsided and roads had been graded to
make travel possible.
</P>
<P>
NSW Premier Bob Carr said affected families would receive
natural disaster relief money from the government.
</P>
<P>
Assistance would be provided in various forms including low
interest loans and subsidies, grants to local councils, loan
assistance to restore damaged facilities and personal hardship and
distress assistance, he said.

ripped through a passenger bus aboard a barge ferrying between two
islands in the southern Philippines, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The local ABS-CBN TV station quoted military sources as saying

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemns U.S. Non-Proliferation Bill on Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday strongly
condemned a non- proliferation bill passed Thursday by the United
States' Senate against Iran.
</P>
<P>
The bill stipulates U.S. financial and economic sanctions
against foreign citizens and organizations, including Russians, if
there is "trustworthy information" that they are violating the
regime of non-proliferation of missile and nuclear technologies to
Iran. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a very similar bill
last September.
</P>
<P>
Such law-making "delivers a serious blow to bilateral and
international cooperation in nonproliferation and export control
and the enforcement of such legislation and especially any steps
to apply it in practice will undermine the legal foundation of
such cooperation, complicate Russian-American relations and
international relations as a whole," the Russian Foreign Ministry
said in a Friday statement.
</P>
<P>
It described the bill as an attempt to pressure Russia and
other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it should be recognized that American
legislators again artificially exacerbate the situation, try to
give an extraterritorial nature to an act of domestic legislation
and exert pressure on foreign countries on a clearly invented
pretext," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's principled stance on the matter remains unchanged --
such a pseudo- imperial approach is impermissible and will not be
accepted," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov also expressed disapproval
of the U.S. bill. He told a Friday press conference in Moscow that
the U.S. Senate's passage of this bill "could complicate even
further the solution of a whole host of issues in Russian-U.S.
bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
"In all likelihood, we will discuss this with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright at a meeting in Lisbon (Portuguese
capital) in early March, even though we had planned a somewhat
different agenda," Ivanov said.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov expressed his

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows by 6.9 Percent in Fourth Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy, propelled
by hardy consumer spending, increased at an annual rate of 6.9
percent in the fourth quarter of 1999, the strongest pace in more
than three years, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The revised estimate was much stronger than the 5.8 percent
fourth-quarter rate the government previously estimated one month
ago, and matched a 6.9 percent growth spurt posted in the second
quarter of 1996. The economy increased by 5.7 percent in third
quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 1999, the real gross domestic product (
GDP) increased 4.1 percent, higher than the government's advance
estimate of 4 percent, but lower the 4.3 percent recorded in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report shows the U.S. economy growing at a more robust pace
than many analysts were predicting. They estimated that the
economy could grow at rates anywhere from 6.3 percent to 6.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has bumped up interest rates four times
since June to slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
Many economists widely expect the central bank will boost rates
again on March 21 given that the economy continues to grow faster
than the Fed's preferred speed limit in the 3 percent range. That'
s believed to be the growth rate that can be sustained without
sparking inflation.
</P>
<P>
A number of factors contributed to the fourth-quarter's
performance: robust consumer and government spending and a strong
buildup in inventories held by businesses added to growth, while
the swelling U.S. trade deficit continued to subtract from it.
</P>
<P>
The government said that consumer spending rose at an annual
rate of 5.9 percent in the fourth quarter, stronger than
previously thought and more brisk than the 4.9 percent rate posted
in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
All that spending pulled the nation's savings rate, savings as
a percentage of disposable income, to a record quarterly low of 1.
8 percent in the fourth quarter, slightly lower than previously
estimated and a worse showing on savings than the 2.1 percent rate
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Businesses, confident that consumers will keep spending,
increased their stockpiles 68.7 billion U.S. dollars, higher than
originally estimated and up from 38 billion dollars in the third
quarter. Business investment, spending on new equipment and plants,
rose at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, the same as previously
thought, but down from the 10.9 percent rate in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Government spending grew by a brisk 9.2 percent in the fourth
quarter, slightly larger than first estimated and higher than the
4.5 percent rate in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit continued to be a drag on economic
growth. Imports grew at a 10 percent rate in the fourth quarter,
down from a 14.9 percent rate in the third quarter. Exports rose
at a 8.7 percent rate, stronger than previously estimated, but
down from a 11.5 percent rate posted in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
An inflation gauge tied to GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.5
percent in the fourth quarter, the same as previously estimated
and slightly higher than the 1.8 percent rate in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
All the changes show the economy growing at an annual rate of
150.3 billion dollars in the fourth quarter of 1999, pushing the
country's total output of goods and services to 9.05 trillion
dollars, after adjusting for inflation.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Foreign Reserves Lowest in 10 Months: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The foreign reserves of
Zambia's central bank declined to an all time low in January of
only 77.65 million U.S. dollars since March last year, according
to a newsletter of the commercial Citibank.
</P>
<P>
The inflow for the month was 5.4 million dollars from donors
and the total outflow was 13.4 million dollars, leading to a
deficit of eight million dollars, the Citibank said in its latest
Treasury Letter.
</P>
<P>
The letter attributed the deficit to the debt service
obligation and other government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The debt service obligation stood at 7.1 million dollars,
accounting for 53 percent of the outflow.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, foreign inflow and outflow through the country's
commercial banks also recorded a deficit, leading to a 2.7 percent
reduction last month.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that "as a consequence of the drop in inflows
in January in the face of high demand, the (Zambian currency)
kwacha lost more value, depreciating by an estimated 3.4 percent
during the month in inter-bank foreign exchange market."

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Says Kosovo Needs More Police Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General George
Robertson said Friday that there is an urgent need to increase the
quantity of police force and to strengthen judicial system in
Kosovo, particularly in Kosovska-Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
After the North Atlantic Council, NATO's decision-making body,
held a meeting to assess the current situation in Kosovo,
Robertson said the 19 NATO allies reaffirmed "willingness to act
collectively and firmly against anyone who attempts to disturb the
peace in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"As last week's events showed, we were able to send
reinforcements to Mitrovica immediately. Those troops had the
training, equipment and leadership to restore order quickly," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson also said NATO will keep the peacekeeping force in
Kosovo "at the right strength to allow it to carry out all its
security tasks in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"Work is in hand urgently to review what more we need to do.
Some additional forces have already been offered and force levels
are under constant review," Robertson said.

<HEADLINE> WHO Launches Vision 2020 in 18 African states </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (
WHO) launched Vision 2020 in 18 French-speaking African countries
Friday as part of a global initiative to eliminate avoidable
blindness by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
Collectively, WHO said, the 18 countries account for around 30
percent of all the blind and visually disabled who live in sub-
Saharan Africa. More than 2 million blind and 6 million visually
impaired people live in the French-speaking African countries.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that up to 80 percent of this blindness and
visual impairment is avoidable. they can be treated or could have
been prevented.
</P>
<P>
However, WHO warned that the number of blind people in Africa
may double by 2020 if no urgent preventive measures were taken.
Major reasons for such an increase include rapid population growth
and aging, appalling living conditions, the severe shortage of
adequately trained ophthalmologists, and the limited supply of
essential eye drugs and modern technologies to prevent and treat
blindness.
</P>
<P>
Launched globally from Geneva in February 1999, Vision 2020 is
based on the concept of a broad coalition of all international,
non-governmental and private organizations, which collaborate with
WHO for blindness prevention and eye care delivery.
</P>
<P>
The initiative launched Friday covers the 18 French-speaking
countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, the Central
African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali,
Niger, Rwanda, Senegal and Togo.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Defending world champion
China won their 13th title when they edged Chinese Taipei 3-1 to
retain the women's title in the 45th World Team Table Tennis
Championships at the Putra Stadium here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women, led by their top paddler Wang Nan, won the
championship despite a strong challenge from Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Chinese paddlers Wang Nan, Li Ju and Zhang Yining only took
about 110 minutes to end Chinese Taipei's challenge in the
competition here.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women, who defeated Chinese Taipei 3-0 in the
preliminary round group's match, dropped one game today when Zhang
Yining lost to Xu Jing in the third rubber.
</P>
<P>
"They are a strong team and gave us a good fight today. But,
our women quickly found their rhythm.
</P>
<P>
"Wang Nan played very well today but Zhang Yining was not at
her best. She made a lot of errors especially in the smashes,
which gave easy points to Xu Jing," said China's deputy head coach
Lu Yuansheng.
</P>
<P>
World number two Li Ju had no trouble delivering China's
opening point after an easy 21-10, 21-11 victory over Tsui Hsui-Li,
which lasted about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The second single match between Wang Nan and Chen Jing, who
ranked fifth in the world, which was expected to be an interesting
affair however turned to be a one-sided game when the off-form
Chen could not match Wang Nan's fast game.
</P>
<P>
Wang Nan, who collected 675 points to win the inaugural "Dawei
Most Valuable Player" award and 3,000 U.S. dollars in the world
championship, won the match 21-7, 21-11 to wrap China's victory.

However, China's hopes of capturing the title earlier were
dented when Zhang Yining lost to Xu Jing in straight sets 19-21,

by beating Hsui-li 21-8, 21-19.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese Taipei's coach Hsu Long-chien was rather
disappointed at Chen's defeat because he expected Chen to deliver
a point.
</P>
<P>
"We changed the strategy, but it did not work out. Chen, who
was expected to give two points, failed to match Wang Nan's game.
Wang Nan was extremely good tonight.
</P>
<P>
"However, overall I'm very happy with the team's performance
because we did not really expect to play in the final," said Long-

<HEADLINE> China Sail into Final, Sweden Struggle Through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Three-time champions
Sweden and hot favorites China have qualified for the men's final
of the 45th World Team Table Tennis Championships in contrasting
styles at the Putra Stadium on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-finals today, China trounced Japan 3-0 while Sweden
had to rely on their most experienced paddler Jan-Ove Waldner to
edge Italy 3-1.
</P>
<P>
China and Sweden have met seven times in the world team
championships final, with China winning four of the encounters.
China also lead 12-3 in meetings between the two countries since
1953.
</P>
<P>
Sweden suffered an early setback when 1991 world champion and
current world number nine Jorgen Persson lost to Italy's
Massimiliano Mondello, ranked 110th, 21-9, 15-21, 18-21 in the
first singles.
</P>
<P>
Two-time world champion Waldner, however, eased the tension in
the Swedish camp when he played steadily to level the score by
beating China-born Italian Yang Min 18-21, 21-14, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
Peter Karlsson then made it 2-1 for Sweden when he disposed of
Valentino Piacentini 21-19, 21-17 before Waldner clinched the
winner with a 21-16, 21-14 victory over Montello.
</P>
<P>
"It will be the right final between the two countries that
dominated the table tennis world since 20 years ago. We will try
our best to stop the Chinese this time around," said Swedish head
coach Ulf Carlsson.
</P>
<P>
Carlsson said he was proud of his charges' performance for the
past six days as they have remained unbeaten in seven matches.
</P>
<P>
China easily wrapped up their match in one-and-a-half hours
although world champion Liu Guoliang dropped a game against Toshio
Tasaki, winning 21-13, 17-21, 21-11 for their opening point.
</P>
<P>
World number two Kong Linghui then made it 2-0 with a stunning
21-12, 21-9 triumph over Japan's defensive player Koji Matsushita
while last year's ITTF Pro Tour champion Liu Guozheng defeated
Seiko Iseki 21-14, 21-12 for the winning point.
</P>
<P>
"It will be an interesting final between Sweden and us tomorrow.
They have several experienced players but our young and energetic
players may turn the tables on them," said China's head coach Cai
Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
Cai said they have no secret weapons for tomorrow's final but
would be cautious.
</P>
<P>
For the record, Sweden won the world title three times in a row
in 1989, 1991 and 1993 with Waldner and Persson being part of the
winning team. Sweden also finished runners-up five times in 33
appearances.
</P>
<P>
China will be gunning for a hat-trick of victories after
Tianjin in 1995 where they defeated Sweden 3-2 and Manchester in
1997 when they beat France in the final.
</P>
<P>
If China win, it will be their 13th world title since making
their debut in 1953.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
has called for earnestly conducting the "Three Emphases" education
among county officials and strengthening ideological work among
youth.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (
CPC), made the call during his five-day inspection tour in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province, which began on February 21 and
ended today.
</P>
<P>
His tour is part of the a recent program of the CPC Central
Committee to promote the "Three Emphasizes" education which
stresses theoretical study, political awareness, and good conduct
among city and county officials across the nation.
</P>
<P>
Li made his first stop in Jingyang County where he asked local
government and party officials to work hard to improve their work
and serve the people wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
He urged them to make every effort to prepare for the national
drive to develop western China.

College students, no matter what their major, should study
dialectic materialism and historical materialism to form the
correct philosophy of life and world outlook.
</P>
<P>
Li said that education is a systemic process involving the
combined efforts of the school, family, and the society, and local

efforts to push for the industrialization of scientific
achievements, and urged local officials to make further efforts to

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's exports and
imports showed further robust growth last month, according to the
external trade figures released Friday by the Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports, comprising re-exports and domestic
exports, grew by 14.1 percent in January over a year earlier to
121.9 billion HK dollars (15.6 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Within the total, the value of re-exports rose by 14.9 percent
to 106.7 billion HK dollars (13.7 billion U.S. dollars), and that
of domestic exports grew by 8.8 percent to 15.2 billion HK dollars
(1.9 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the value of imports increased by 16.4 percent in

HK dollars (89.7 million U.S. dollars), equivalent to 0.6 percent
of the value of imports, recorded in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman said the growth impetus came
mainly from the continued surge in regional demand, as well as the
sustained strong import absorption in the conventional overseas
markets.

<HEADLINE> China to Produce Two Million Motor Vehicles in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China plans to produce two
million motor vehicles this year, including 700,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
To meet this target, the country will reform taxes and levies
on purchases of motor vehicles, and adopt measures to support
manufacturers to produce economy cars, said an official with the
State Administration of Machinery.
</P>
<P>
During the 1994-1998 period, the country's auto industry
entered a period of readjustment, with an annual growth rate of
between three and five percent.
</P>
<P>
Organizational restructuring of the firms, as well as changes
in the product mix and the nature of the market were brought about
during that period, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the central government has supported three
major automakers, the Shanghai Auto Group Corp, Dongfeng Auto, and
Number 1 Auto.
</P>
<P>
With improved living standards, millions of Chinese families
now have their own cars, and the numbers are increasing daily.
Statistics show that of all the cars sold in the country nearly a
half are bought by families.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the country produced 1.8 million motor vehicles, up
ten percent over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Mayon Volcano Evacuees Increase to 30,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that the number of Mayon evacuees has reached 30,418 after
the country' most active volcano erupted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cedric Daep, chief of the Provincial Disaster Management Office,
said the evacuees have been housed in 34 evacuation centers
throughout Albay province where the volcano is located.
</P>
<P>
He said the increasing number of evacuees from different towns
led to greater demand for relief assistance from the government
and the private sectors.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada flew to the provincial
capital of Legaspi City Friday afternoon to comfort thousands of
residents displaced by the eruption.
</P>
<P>
Estrada gave 20 million pesos (500,000 U.S. dollars) in check
to cover the food requirements of evacuees after he was told by
Albay Governor Al Francis Bichara that 13.4 million pesos (335,000
dollars) is needed to feed the people in evacuation centers.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the government will spare no time and resources to
address health problems that may arise due to congestion, as well
as concerns of shortage of relief goods and medicines.
</P>
<P>
An update report of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and
Seismology (Phivolcs) showed that lava effusion, pyroclastic flows,
ash ejection, which have occurred during previous observations,
continue to be emitted.
</P>
<P>
The institute said Alert Level 5 was still being maintained
since "the occurrence of more hazardous eruptions can not be
discounted."
</P>
<P>
The Phivolcs noted that the 6-kilometer Permanent Danger Zone
around Mayon and the 8-kilometer extension of the danger zone in
the southeast sector of the volcano should be strictly observed.
</P>
<P>
Volcanologists warned that based on Mayon's eruption records,
after a series of explosions, the volcano may rest for a while and
a second round of eruption could be expected to resume.
</P>
<P>
The 2,462-meter Mayon Volcano has erupted at least 40 times
since 1616 and its last major eruption was in 1993, which killed
some 70 people.

<HEADLINE> Daya Bay Nuke Plant Operates Smoothly in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Daya Bay Nuclear Power
Plant in south China's Guangdong Province operated quite well in
1999 with its nuclear safety up to world standard and power output
reaching a historic high, authorities of the plant said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the plant, Chow Haiyoong,
executive deputy general manager of Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint
Venture Co. LTD, said that the plant's No.1 and No.2 generating
units had set a new record of non-stop safe operation for 307 days
and 318 days respectively in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Other criteria of the plant, such as nuclear safety,
radioactive protection and industry safety also reached the world'
s advanced level, Chow said, adding that the plant had won first
place in a "safe, stable operation" competition held in France
among the same kind of generating units.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the latest 10 performance indices released by the
World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), all of the Daya Bay
plant's 10 indices were above the world's average, and six of them
reached an advanced level, Chow said.
</P>
<P>
The plant last year generated 13.46 billion kwh of electricity
for the Guangdong and Hong Kong grid, earning 560 million U.S.
dollars in hard currency. Now the plant has paid off 61.6 percent
of its bank loans, according to Chow.
</P>
<P>
The plant's environmental protection measures also proved
efficient, with its emission of waste gas and water way below the
standards set by the government, Chow said.
</P>
<P>
The Daya Bay plant, operated by the Guangdong Nuclear
Investment Co. Ltd. and Hong Kong Nuclear Investment Co. Ltd, can
generate 13.5 billion kwh of electricity annually. It began
operation in 1994 under an agreement that 30 percent of its
electricity would go to Guangdong and the remainder to Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> HK's Exchange Fund 1.25 Percent Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) announced Friday that the assets of the exchange
fund totaled 990.2 billion HK dollars (126.9 billion U.S. dollars)
on January 31, down 1.25 percent from the amount at the end of
last December.
</P>
<P>
The figure is included in the Exchange Fund Abridged Balance
Sheet, which is released on a monthly basis together with the
Currency Board Account.
</P>
<P>
The foreign currency assets shrank by 2.3 billion HK dollars (
295 million U.S. dollars), mainly due to a reduction in currency
notes outstanding and the sale of foreign currencies for Hong Kong
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong dollar assets decreased by 10.2 billion HK
dollars (1.3 billion U.S. dollars) largely as a result of the
decline in the market value of Hong Kong equities held by the
Exchange Fund, which was partially offset by an increase in net
placements by government funds and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
Figures in the Currency Board Account show that the monetary
base at the end of January was 223.7 billion HK dollars (28.7
billion U.S. dollars), down 4.56 percent from the end of December
1999.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was attributable to reductions in Certificates of
Indebtedness and the Aggregate Balance, by 5.7 billion HK dollars
(731 million U.S. dollars) and 5.5 billion HK dollars (705 million
U.S. dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
These changes reflected a reversal of the high demand for bank
notes and inter-bank liquidity associated with seasonal and Year
2000 related factors.
</P>
<P>
The backing assets decreased by 3.88 percent to 247 billion HK
dollars (31.7 billion U.S. dollars). The decline was mainly driven
by the corresponding decreases in Certificates of Indebtedness and
the Aggregate Balance in the monetary base, which were partly
offset by net income and revaluation gains of 1.1 billion HK
dollars (141 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Reflecting this, the backing ratio increased from 109.64
percent at the end of December to 110.43 percent at the end of
January.

Chinese Premier Meets Vietnamese Foreign Minister
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji told visiting Vietnamese Foreign Minister
Nguyen Dy Nien here today that Sino-Vietnamese relations have been
progressing steadily thanks to efforts made by both countries in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Zhu appreciated Nien's selection of China as the destination of
his first overseas trip after assuming the post of foreign
minister, which itself shows the importance the Communist Party of
Vietnam (CPV) and the Vietnamese government attach to Sino-Vietnam
ties.
</P>
<P>
Zhu gave a positive appraisal of the growth momentum of
bilateral ties over recent years, noting that both countries have
had regular high-level visits, kept improving economic cooperation
and gradually resolved problems between the two countries that
have left over from history.
</P>
<P>
China, Vietnam Vow to Push Sea Border Demarcation
</P>
<P>
China will work together with Vietnam to accelerate
negotiations on the demarcation of the Beibu Gulf in order to
complete as scheduled the task assigned them by leaders of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan made the remarks today
during an afternoon meeting with his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen
Dy Nien, who arrived here last evening for a four-day official
visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the two countries should push forward the follow-up
to the bilateral land border treaty signed at the end of last year,
adding that this treaty, concluded through joint efforts, is
conducive to the long-standing stability along the border, and
accords with the fundamental interests and common aspiration of
the peoples of both countries.

<P>
 School in Gansu Gets Japanese Aid

<P>
The Japanese government donated 81,908 U.S. dollars to a
primary school in northwest China's Gansu province today.
</P>
<P>
The tuition-free "Project Hope" Xiepo Primary School was
established in 1996 by a devoted young man called Hou Xinmin.
</P>
<P>
Before the school enrolled students, only 14 percent of
children in his neighborhood were able to attend school. Eighty
percent of villagers were illiterate.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Jets Strike Hezbollah Targets in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes early
Friday struck Hezbollah targets in south Lebanon in retaliation for
the guerrilla group's shelling of the outposts of the Israel
Defense Forces (IDF) there, the IDF said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Air Forces conducted several air raids on Hezbollah
targets in the western sector of the security zone and all planes
returned to their bases safely, the IDF said, adding that there
were no reports of casualties on the Hezbollah side.
</P>
<P>
The airstrikes were ordered after Hezbollah shelled several
outposts of the IDF and the South Lebanon Army (SLA) in the western
sector of the security zone, but there were no casualties reported
among IDF and SLA soldiers, the IDF added.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
self-proclaimed purpose of protecting its northern security. The
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been spearheading a resistance
movement to oust Israeli troops and its ally SLA from the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the situation in south Lebanon
has been worsening as the two sides intensified their military
operations. So far, seven IDF soldiers have been killed inside the
security zone.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Israeli fighter jets hit three Lebanese
power stations and other civilian facilities, saying the strikes
could send a clear message to both Lebanese and Syrian governments
that they must rein in the military activities of Hezbollah in the
security zone.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the Knesset (parliament) on Wednesday, Foreign
Minister David Levy warned that Lebanese soil will "burn" if
Hezbollah attacks northern Israel and that Israel would retaliate "
blood for blood...child for child" if Hezbollah fires on northern
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has defended Levy's warning, a move
which triggered widespread criticism from the United States, Syria,
Lebanon and other countries.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of comment is inappropriate. We don not need rhetoric
from anybody that inflames the situation," U.S. State Department
spokesman James Rubin said in Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss said in Beirut Thursday
that "a minister like Levy is evil and thoughts such as the ones he
expressed Wednesday night prove he is afflicted by racism and
arrogance."
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who is here on a visit to
Israel, Thursday urged Hezbollah to stop its military operations
against the IDF in the security zone and called on Israel to
withdraw from south Lebanon within the framework of an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said after meeting with Barak that a pullback from
Lebanon in the context of an agreement is preferable to a
unilateral pullback, but even that is better than continuing the
occupation.
</P>
<P>
"For the stability of Lebanon, for the sake of Syria's presence
in Lebanon, and for Israeli security, an Israeli withdrawal from
Lebanon would be preferable under conditions of an agreement,"
Jospin said.
</P>
<P>
He also said France will play a more active role in the Mideast
peace process if it has been asked for.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Approves Amnesty Prolongation for Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma, the
lower house of the parliament, Friday passed a motion to extend
amnesty deadline for Chechen rebels till May 15, by a vote of 361
for, six against, with two abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the amnesty approved by the Duma on December 13
declared that those Chechen rebels who committed no serious crime
and would lay down their weapons before February 1 would be
regarded as guiltless. But it excluded the rebel leaders,
important criminals and terrorists with foreign or no nationality.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Gurov, chairman of the Security Committee of the Duma,
who submitted the draft resolution, said that the effectiveness of
the amnesty "is quite evident" but admitted that "rebel leaders
conceal the amnesty from members of their formations in every way.
"
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the prolongation initiative had come from
acting Russian President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Ilyukhin, member of the committee (Communist), spoke
against the prolongation and suggested a return to the issue when
law enforcement bodies have collected enough materials about the
participation and non-participation of specific militants in acts
of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, Alexander Kotenkov, Putin's envoy in the Duma, said he
talked to the defense and interior ministers on Thursday and both
strongly supported the prolongation.
</P>
<P>
Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov announced that the amnesty will
come into force as of the date of its official publication.

<HEADLINE> "One China Principle" Hailed in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- People from various circles in
east China's Fujian and Zhejiang provinces expressed their firm
support for the "One China Principle" and opposed any activity
aimed at separating Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
A forum to mark the 53rd anniversary of the Taiwan "February 28
Uprising" was held Friday in Fuzhou, the provincial capital of
Fujian Province, and a symposium was held in Hangzhou, Zhejiang's
provincial capital, Thursday on the recently released white paper
entitled "The One China Principle and the Taiwan Issue."
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Taiwan compatriots attending the forum said
the purpose of commemorating the uprising is to promote the
glorious tradition of patriotism, put into practice the eight-
point proposition made by President Jiang Zemin on China's
reunification, and stick to the "One China Principle."
</P>
<P>
The uprising of February 28, 1947 was an armed struggle in
Taiwan Province against the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
At the Zhejiang symposium Hu Guohua, director of the Zhejiang
University Research Institute on the Taiwan Issue, said the white
paper was to the point and very convincing.
</P>
<P>
The process for the complete reunification of China has reached
a new stage since the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the
motherland, and the development of the relationship across the
Taiwan Straits now faces new opportunities and challenges, said
representatives to the symposium.
</P>
<P>
The representatives said they will further study the white
paper and make their own contributions to the reunification of
China.

Tang noted the smooth development of relations between the two
countries and parties since the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese
relations more than eight years ago, and said that exchanges and
cooperation in all areas have been strengthened.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to the Beijing summit meeting of General
Secretary Jiang Zemin of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee and his Vietnamese counterpart Le Kha Phieu in
February last year, saying that during that meeting, the two
leaders set a framework for relations oriented toward the 21st
century and characterized by stability, good-neighborliness, and
all-around cooperation, thus marking a new era for bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Nien, who is on his first visit to China since assuming his
post last month, told Tang that the two countries are friendly
socialist neighbors, and the peoples of the two countries have
supported each other for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese Communist Party, government, and people will not
forget China's enormous support and help, he said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Tang's remarks, the Vietnamese foreign minister said
that the framework set by Jiang and Phieu can serve as a strategic
guide for advancing bilateral ties in the new century.
</P>
<P>
He said that Vietnam will join hands with China to attempt to
settle the Beibu Gulf demarcation issue this year, as planned.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also discussed other international
issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> China Releases Report on Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China this week published its
first book introducing and analyzing the current situation of its
children, raising the advantages and problems in child development.
</P>
<P>
"New Discovery -- Report on the Current Development of Chinese
Children," edited by the Chinese Juvenile Research Center,
summarized the achievements in this field in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The book points out that today's Chinese children pay more
attention to self development, have a strong sense of equality,
and are fond of taking part in collective activities.
</P>
<P>
However, they face some problems. Some urban children have
little time to do household chores, over half of them get an
insufficient time for rest, while others have little opportunity
to participate in organized activities.
</P>
<P>
The team began its research last May among some 4000 children
in 45 counties in ten provinces.
</P>
<P>
They also asked that the society pay attention to the health of
children, especially their physiological well-being, and provide
more opportunities for them to exercise, as well as reduce their
homework load.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Ruling Coalition Agrees on Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said that the three leaders of ruling coalition reached "
full consensus" over the formula of "5+5" constitutional amendment
on presidency, the Anatolia News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that the draft will soon be offered for the
signature of deputies from the three coalition parties, adding that
he is confident that the amendment will easily be legislated with
the support of over 367 deputies and without the need to go to a
referendum.
</P>
<P>
The amendment sponsored by Ecevit would reduce the presidential
term to five years from the current seven years but allow a second
term, namely "5+5" formula, aiming at paving the way for incumbent
President Suleyman Demirel to extend his term in office.
</P>
<P>
According to existing Turkish Constitution, Demirel, whose term
will expire in May, has no right to run for second presidency.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers of the Motherland Party led by Mesut Yilmaz, a partner
of the coalition government, had opposed reelection of Demirel.
Ecevit had made efforts to convince Yilmaz to control his deputies,
in order to ensure the required minimum votes to legislate the "5+
5" formula in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Tansu Ciller, leader of the True Path Party
who ever objected to Ecevit's version with another main opposition
Virtue Party, has changed mind following meeting with Ecevit.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Assures Foreign Investors of Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has assured foreign investors of the safety of both their
lives and investment in the country by saying that his government
can contain any violence.
</P>
<P>
During meeting with a visiting French trade mission in the
capital Abuja Thursday, Obasanjo said his government is aware of
the importance of a conducive atmosphere in investment and is
doing everything possible to create the good environment that
foreign investors require.
</P>
<P>
"We are not yet perfect, but we are doing our best to improve
rapidly and offer better conditions than others," the Punch
newspaper Friday quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria would offer abundant opportunities for investors, not
only in oil and gas, but also in manufacturing, trade and
commerce, Obasanjo said.
</P>
<P>
The most populous African country has been taking every
painstaking effort to attract foreign investment in a bid to
revitalize its ailing economy since Obasanjo took office last May
after long military rule.
</P>
<P>
The clashes, which broke out Monday between Christians and
Moslems in the northern Kaduna city over the proposed Islamic
Sharia law, is sure to take its toll economically in a country
direly need foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"The international community is beginning to regain its
confidence in our nation. We cannot afford to lose the
considerable amount of goodwill that has greeted our transition to
the democratic governance," Obasanjo told the nation in a
televised address Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We need that goodwill to sustain our efforts at reconstructing
the country and improving the economic prosperity of every man,
woman and child in this country," the president said.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, Nigeria
ranked the first among the African countries in attracting foreign
investors.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Tea Prices Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenya tea prices are higher
again this week at the auction in the port city Mombasa as most
exporters bought forward to protect themselves against a possible
fall in supply, local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Brighter Broken Pekoe ones (BP1s) were up to 0.12 dollars
higher at Thursday trading, with the best BP1s selling between
2.64 to 2.73 U.S. dollars per kilogram, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Brokers forecast prices would continue to rise as the tea
production suffered from searing temperature in the growing areas
in eastern Kenya while plantations in western Kenya are
struggling to recover from record frost outbreak.
</P>
<P>
A freak frost in late January hit the major tea-growing areas
in the west of the country and between 26,000 to 49,000 acres of
tea had been destroyed. Reports said that small-scale growers in
number of frost-hit districts incurred 100 percent loss.
</P>
<P>
The auction this week saw 104,00 bags (some 60 kgs per bag)
sold. "Next week there are only 95,000 bags on the catalogue and
the week after it is only 83,000," said James Miyano of Anjeli
Tea Broker.
</P>
<P>
An official of one leading tea brokerage house predicted prices
could rise "by 10 percent or more" at the next two auctions.

<HEADLINE> Britain Concerned Over Nigeria's Sharia Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The British government expressed
deep concern over the clashes between Christians and Moslems in
Nigeria's northern city of Kaduna over the proposed implementation
of the Islamic Sharia law in Kaduna State.
</P>
<P>
The former suzerain of Nigeria was "deeply concerned at the
situation in Kaduna and condemn the violence of the past few days"
which has caused some 300 deaths, British Minister for Foreign
Affairs Peter Hain said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Friday quoted Hain
as saying that he was saddened at the reports of deaths.
</P>
<P>
However, the British official said that "I'm encouraged that
calm has now returned to the city, and I support the Nigerian
government's attempt to engage both sides and reduce tension."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Administrator in Kosovo Says Conflict With Serbia Unlikely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Civil
Administrator in Kosovo Bernard Kouchner said on Friday that a new
conflict between NATO and Serbia in Kosovo is unlikely, despite
the tension prevailing in Kosovo since early this month.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Radio Europe 1, Kouchner also called for
the deployment of more international police force in the Yugoslav
province to reinforce the means to guarantee security for the two
ethnic communities there.
</P>
<P>
He said there were probably "infiltrations" by Serbs into
northern Kosovo, particularly the city of Kosovska Mitrovica, but
now it is very difficult for the Serbs to enter Kosovo as all the
entries into the city are strictly controlled by the NATO-led
multinational peacekeeping force, the KFOR.
</P>
<P>
On an eventual conflict between NATO and Serbia, Kouchner said
he does not expect it to take place.
</P>
<P>
"First, the KFOR supervises very closely the movement of the (
Serb) troops... Secondly, the KFOR has the necessary forces to
make such a confrontation impossible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been high since early February in northern Kosovo
after some clashes took place between the Serbs and Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The KFOR has been searching for arms in both the Serb and
Albanian areas of Kosovska Mitrovica after the clashes took place,
in which at least nine people were killed.
</P>
<P>
A plan to reinforce the KFOR is also under discussion among
NATO countries.

<HEADLINE> CBI raises Growth Forecast For Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The economy of the United
Kingdom will grow robustly this year before slowing slightly next
year, according to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
In its latest quarterly forecast, the CBI revised upwards its
previous estimates for economic growth, citing improved exports
for British companies helped by improved global demand.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said it had underestimated the growth in household
consumption, which would help drive total GDP growth to 3.1
percent this year, a revision of 0.2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
In a separate survey, the CBI said manufacturers' order books
were in their healthiest state for almost two years and there were
signs that firms would soon put up their prices.
</P>
<P>
The CBI expected interest rates, currently at 6 percent, to
peak at 6.25 percent rather than the 5.75 percent in its November
forecast.
</P>
<P>
Household consumption will grow 3.5 percent rather than 2.7
percent and underlying inflation will come in at 2.2 percent
rather than 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The CBI also revised its forecast for sterling, saying it would
be some 6 percent stronger by the end of this year than previously
thought.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Financial Reconstruction Commission Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Michio Ochi, chairman of Japan's
Financial Reconstruction Commission (FRC), resigned Friday over
his recent remarks suggesting that he would use his influence to
soften inspections on financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi appointed Sadakazu
Tanigaki,former Science and Technology Agency chief and member of
his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), as the new FRC chairman.
</P>
<P>
"My careless remarks have created a stir, and I believe my
resignation would solve the problem," Ochi told reporters after
submitting a letter of resignation to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Ochi's resignation was widely expected following the revelation
of the taped remarks at a gathering last Saturday of local bankers.
</P>
<P>
According to the tape, Ochi told the gathering that the "utmost
consideration" would be given to financial institutions that
believe that financial inspections are too strict.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were considered to have damaged public trust in the
government's financial inspections.
</P>
<P>
Japan's opposition parties had been calling for Ochi's
resignation from Thursday. The calls were also echoed by some
members of the LDP, to which Ochi belongs.

<HEADLINE> One China Principle Forms Basis For Peaceful Reunification: Experts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The one China principle is a
prerequisite for the peaceful reunification of the motherland,
experts and scholars of the Taiwan issue said here today at a
forum on the white paper China issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
They noted the white paper, titled "The One China Principle and
the Taiwan Issue", has sent a clear message to the international
community and Taiwan that the Chinese government will not sit idle
as separatist forces attempt to separate the island from the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
"Peaceful reunification conforms to the best interests of
Chinese compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits," said
Prof. Su Ge of the Foreign Affairs College.
</P>
<P>
Upholding the One China principle and recognizing that China's
sovereignty and territory cannot be divided form the basis of
negotiations on an equal footing between the two sides of the
Straits, Su said.
</P>
<P>
To deviate from the principle and attempt to divide the island
from the motherland undermines the prerequisite for peaceful
reunification, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
It is widely recognized by the international community that
there is only one China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China,
said Jiang Dianming, vice president of the Taiwan Studies Society.
That is a view once shared by both the Chinese Communist Party and
the Chinese Kuomintang, Jiang noted.

<HEADLINE> China to Strictly Curb Intellectual Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China has vowed to strictly
curb rampant audio-visual piracy this year and cultivate
legitimate production and trade.
</P>
<P>
"A severe crackdown on piracy is the most important job this
year," Tuo Zuhai, an official with the Ministry of Culture, told
Xinhua on Friday.
</P>
<P>
China is now carrying out a three-month sting operation on
smuggling and pirated publications, and so far over 700,000 VCDs
have been confiscated, Tuo said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry continues to confiscate other illegal
publications disseminated by the Falungong cult containing
superstitious or erotic content.
</P>
<P>
Tuo also said that in April authorities will strike out against
illegal DVDs, which are now rampant on the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The ministry urged localities to curtail half of the existing
162 audio-visual markets nationwide, and the government also
suggested establishing chain stores for these products.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the regulation of audio-visual
publications will be revised soon, and the administration might,
for the first time, allow private businesses into this trade.
</P>
<P>
Smuggling and the illegal production of VCDs have seriously
endangered the state's publication industry, Tuo said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, law enforcement teams have ferreted out more than
80 illegal production lines.
</P>
<P>
Professionals estimate the total yearly consumption of audio-
visual products to be valued at between 15 and 20 billion yuan (
about 2 billion U.S. dollars). However, sales of legal products
only reached 1.4 billion yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Protecting this market is a long-term job for us," Tuo said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese top leaders have often stressed the importance of
safeguarding intellectual property.

<HEADLINE> Choosing "Taiwan Independence" Means Choosing War: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The white paper "The One-China
Principle and the Taiwan Issue" shows the strong determination of
the Chinese government and people to oppose separatism and "Taiwan
independence". Choosing "Taiwan independence" means choosing war,
and certain number of people on the island should have a clear
understanding of this.
</P>
<P>
This is the unanimous view of the participants attending a
forum held here today by the China Council for the Promotion of
Peaceful Reunification (CCPPR).
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress and president of the CCPPR, spoke at
the forum, reiterating that "peaceful reunification" and the "one
country, two systems" principle is China's basic policy. "We know
that Taiwan compatriots are longing for peace," but separatist
activities and "Taiwan independence" will make it impossible to
realize peace across the Taiwan Straits, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang criticized some people in Taiwan who are advocating "
Taiwan independence" on the one hand, and on the other, are
spreading rumors on so-called "good-will reconciliation, lasting
peace" to cheat Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
"We must be on high alert and firmly destroy 'Taiwan
independence' and separatist forces who are attempting to separate
Taiwan from China", he said.
</P>
<P>
The CCPPR, a non-government organization, will continue to
promote and develop exchanges across the Taiwan Straits to push
forward reunification at an earlier date in line with the "one
country, two systems" principle and President Jiang Zemin's eight-
point proposition, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> China Outlines Long-Term Heritage Protection Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to use its
treasured ancient heritage sites and cultural ruins as a way of
exhibiting its unique tradition.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture and the State Administration of
Cultural Relics (SACH) today released the outline for an overall
relics protection program for the next 15 years, aimed at
strenthening the national pride of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The terra cotta warriors guarding the tomb of Qinshihuang,
China's first emperor, and the ruins of the ancient capital of the
Shang Dynasty (16th Century B.C.-- 11the Century B.C.) are already
the pride of the nation, and the government will establish four
reserves for these historical ruins in five years, focusing on
research into the origin of Chinese civilization.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2015, China expects to have 25 World Cultural
Heritage sites listed, which are honored by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). At
present, 14 sites including the Great Wall and the Palace Museum
are on the heritage list.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China wishes to set up a nationwide computerized
database for its cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
SACH also plans to increase the total number of museums from 1,
800 to 3,000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state authorities will initiate about 100 major
projects for relics repairs.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the country's westward development will bring new
challenges for relics protection in China. The ongoing
construction for the Three Gorges Dam and the oil fields in the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region might well result in new
archeological finds, experts say.
</P>
<P>
The government is also preparing to establish a National
Heritage Day.

<P>
History has shown that the One China principle constitutes the
foundation of peace between the two sides of the Straits, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
The white paper was issued at a crucial time of the development
of cross-Straits relations, and it unequivocally states the
Chinese government stance on the Taiwan issue, said Researcher Xin
Qi at the Peace and Development Studies Center.
</P>
<P>
The white paper again demonstrates the Chinese government's
position on the Taiwan issue and its determination to safeguard
national sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs, Xin
said.
</P>
<P>
The mainland will not await peaceful reunification indefinitely
and "peaceful separation" is intolerable, Xin noted, adding that
the white paper will help promote the development of cross-Straits
relations.
</P>
<P>
Upholding the One China principle conforms with the interests
of the people of Taiwan, said Su Minsheng, vice president of the
All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people on both sides of the Straits share the same
blood. The majority of Taiwan compatriots wish for stability,
peace and development and do not want see a cross-Straits tension,
Su said.
</P>
<P>
However, Taiwan authorities have deviated further from the One
China Principle, and seriously undermined cross-Straits relations
and the interests of Taiwan compatriots.

Xu Bodong of the Taiwan Studies Society pointed out that some U.

Taiwan Security Enhancement Act and sell weapons to the island on
various pretext.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has encouraged separatist forces on the island and
brazenly interferred in China's internal affairs, Xu stressed.
</P>
<P>
The experts noted that the "three ifs" and "three nevers"
mentioned in the white paper are the conditions for settling the
Taiwan issue by non-peaceful means, expounded for the first time
by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
They said the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland
has urgently brought the issue of reunification with the mainland
to the foreground and the cross-Straits relations have come to a
critical juncture, offering both opportunities and challenges.
</P>
<P>
Experts expressed the hope that Taiwan compatriots will make a
clear distinction between right and wrong, oppose any forms of
separatist activities and continue to strive for the healthy
growth of cross-Straits relations, the peaceful reunification of
the motherland, and the revitalization of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The forum was sponsored by the Taiwan Studies Society. More

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Says to Respect People's Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here on Friday that he respects people's vote in
the 6th Majlis (parliament) elections although his own fate is
still in suspense.
</P>
<P>
The senior politician, currently heading the Expediency Council,
is one of the 866 candidates in Tehran contesting the
constituency's 30 seats in the expanded 290-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
"I thank those who voted for me and respect all those who did
not want to vote for me and voted for others instead. We must also
respect the repercussions of the people's vote as well," Rafsanjani
was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's fate depends on the announcement of the final
election results for Tehran constituency.
</P>
<P>
Final election results, due to be announced Thursday, are
expected Friday because related bodies in the Interior Ministry
were recounting the votes of some 105 ballot boxes "to remove all
doubt."
</P>
<P>
Most of the Tehran seats have been won by the reformist group
the Islamic Iran Participation Front headed by President Mohammed
Khatami's younger brother.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest results in Tehran issued by the Interior
Ministry, Rafsanjani is in the 28th place with 693,606 or 24.86
percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The centrist candidates, who are supported by the conservatives,
will need at least 25 percent of the votes to be elected in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, a total of 191 seats have been confirmed across the
country with reformists winning 137, the conservatives taking only
39, and the rest going to independents. And 69 seats have to be
decided in a run-off to be held in April because the candidates
involved failed to get 25 percent of the total votes.
</P>
<P>
The sweeping victory of the reformists are expected to help push
through President Khatami's reform policies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a large group of Muslim worshipers gathered for the
Friday mass prayer, Rafsanjani said that the presence of about 27
million people at last Friday's polls shows their interest in and
allegiance to the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The official also indirectly slammed Turkish Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit for his comment on the Iranian Majlis elections.
</P>
<P>
Following the victory of reformers in Iran's parliamentary
elections, Ecevit said now that Iran had elected a pro-reform
parliament he hoped it would stop exporting its brand of hard-line
Islam.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the "impudent propaganda" by those who imagine that
this election means the end of the Islamic revolution, Rafsanjani
said, "Do not repeat the past mistakes. You do not know the people
of Iran. You do not know Islam. You have no idea about the people's
love for the revolution."
</P>
<P>
He said what had happened in Iran was only "a competition within
a single family." This sort of rivalry, he said, would never be a
threat to the Islamic system.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military to Reduce Political Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking during a hearing with the Ad Hoc committee I of the
People's Consultative Assembly's (MPR) working committee, TNI
Commander Adm. Widodo AS said that such relinquishment will be
reflected in TNI's neutrality in general elections and the
termination of its presence in the House of Representatives (DPR)
by 2004.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, it should be noted that TNI members have
equal political rights to those of other citizens, namely to vote
and to be elected," Widodo sad.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the presence of TNI representatives in the MPR
body, Widodo said,"We just want all parties to be represented in
the highest state body of MPR. On this matter we leave it up to
the ad hoc committee members to decide whether or not the TNI will
have its representatives in the MPR," he said.
</P>
<P>
The TNI, along with the National Police (Polri), has 38 seats
in the House. Those who hold the House seats are also members of
the MPR.
</P>
<P>
Widodo reiterated the TNI commitment to support democratization
process which has been taking place in Indonesia, adding that the
TNI will support the legitimate government under president
Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
"The TNI is committed, in line with its new paradigm, to reduce
its political role. Culturally, such a change is not easy, and it
will take time, but with the support of the House and the MPR, we
are confident that we will succeed in dealing with such a change,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"And all TNI chiefs of staff have committed to proceed with
internal reform, particularly in connection with the cultural
aspect," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Supports Constitution Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Military (TNI)
Friday voiced its appreciation and support for the efforts made by
the Peoples Consultatives Assembly (MPR) ad hoc committee I to
amend the country's 1945 constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The TNI appreciates and supports the change of the 1945
constitution (which will be done) by the MPR which now have been
deliberated by the ad hoc committee I," TNI Chief Adm. Widodo said
in a hearing with the committee.
</P>
<P>
But Widodo cautioned that such a change should take into
consideration the interest of the nation in the future, saying
that the change will be really fundamental.
</P>
<P>
Based on its mandate given in October general session last year,
the MPR will change or delete some articles of the 1945
constitution in a bid to adapt with the new conditions and
paradigm of Indonesia and the development of international
community.
</P>
<P>
The ad hoc committee was also given a deadline by the MPR
general session to complete the amendment by August 2000, when the
amendment will be validated by the MPR members in a plenary
session.
</P>
<P>
But such a change will not cover the preamble of 1945
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The constitution amendment will likely influence the TNI's role
in political practices as some of the constitution articles
stipulating the TNI's political role will be revised or deleted.

Jeter was ambassador to Botswana from 1993 to 1996 and had
worked in many other African nations as U.S. diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The post of ambassador to Nigeria is very important in the U.S.
 diplomacy in Africa as President Bill Clinton's administration
has repeatedly pledged its commitment to ensuring the success of
Nigeria's nascent democracy and improving the relationship with
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is one of so-called four key U.S. foreign policy
priorities for the year 2000 and Washington has proposed large aid
increase for the most populous African country in the hope that
its democratic transition can serve as a regional model.

<HEADLINE> NPC Standing Committee Makes Headway in Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), has improved legislative
procedures and supervision over government and judicial
organizations in the second term of office.
</P>
<P>
The NPC has heard 30 draft laws and adopted 19 of them after
the NPC plenum in March last year fulfilling its legislative plan
for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Some of the new laws are crucial for the development of the
market economy, the protection of human rights and maintaining
social stability.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Enterprises under Sole Individual Proprietorship was
implemented last year together with laws on corporations and
partnership businesses.
</P>
<P>
Laws on administrative appeals, compensation and supervision
have greatly improved supervisory mechanisms in the government.
</P>
<P>
And the NPC's decision to outlaw, prevent and eliminate cults
is of major significance in maintaining social stability in China.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee made amendments to laws concerning
income tax, highways tolls and corporate law.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the NPC Standing Committee adopted a
decision on tightening its supervision over the central government
budget and discussed legislation on the supervision over judicial
departments.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee conducted inspections on air
pollution prevention laws, forestry, product quality and
compulsory education. It also heard and examined reports from the
State Council on the living conditions of laid-off workers, relief
work in rural areas and the improvement of public security
departments.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee had conducted extensive surveys and
studies. For example, the chairman of the NPC committee visited
several provinces to solicit ideas and suggestions on drafting
laws.
</P>
<P>
Various special committees of the NPC and other departments
have also work hard to solicit advice from many experts, scholars
and the people while drafting laws.
</P>
<P>
Standing committees of the people's congresses at provincial
and other levels have made concerted efforts to improve the
supervision over their departments and take concrete measures to
improve morale and enthusiasm of China's three million deputies
who work for people's congresses.

<HEADLINE> Non-Communist Party Figures Appointed "Special Prosecutors" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme People's
Procuratorate (SPP) appointed 20 non-Communist Party "special
prosecutors" today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhubin, procurator-general of the SPP, said at the
ceremony that "the decision to appoint non-communist party members
as prosecutors reflects multi-party cooperation and political
consultation under the Communist Party of China leadership."
</P>
<P>
The twenty economic and legal experts and government officials
come from eight non-Communist political parties and the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce,. One government official
belongs to no party.
</P>
<P>
The "special prosecutors" would also serve as a bridge between
procuratorial bodies and the public, Han said.
</P>
<P>
The SPP began appointing "special prosecutors" in 1990. Today'
s new appointees make up the fourth group. "Special prosecutors"
have been invited to attend important policy-making procuratorate
meetings and participate in prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorates have handled a large number of complaints,
appeals on the recommendation of these "special prosecutors," Han
said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Israel Seek Compromise: Ross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S Middle East Peace Envoy Denis
Ross said he sensed a Palestinian and Israeli willingness for
breaking the current deadlock in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Voice of Palestine quoted Ross as saying late last night after
his meeting with Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat in the West Bank city of Ramallah. This was the second
meeting between Arafat and Ross in less than three days.
</P>
<P>
The two sides want not only to solve the ongoing crisis also to
reach a compromise on the final status issues, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli marathon talks to conclude a framework
agreement by February 13 on thorniest issues such as the fate of
Jerusalem, the Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees and
borders, hit a snag early this month following an unsuccessful
meeting between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are stumbled over land transfer. Under a September
interim peace deal, Israel should have handed over another 6.1
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian rule on January 20.
</P>
<P>
But Israel's failure to respect a compromise deal to let the
Palestinian side have a say in deciding the maps on targeted land
angered the Palestinians, who rejected the maps.
</P>
<P>
Ross who arrived in the region to give the sluggish peace talks
a push, promised the U.S will continue its role as a mediator in
the peace process to thaw a three-week ice between the Palestinians
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat said the
stands between both sides over the troops redeployment and the
final issues such as the prisoners and the settlements are still
far apart.
</P>
<P>
The rift on such issues should not be played down, he warned,
adding that a final solution has to be reached by September 13, a
date by which the Palestinians and Israel should conclude a
permanent peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Fresh Raids on South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel launched the first air
raid in south Lebanon early Friday in a week, but there was no
immediate report on damage or casualties.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli warplanes fired two air-to-surface missiles on a
mountainous area just north of the Israeli self-styled security
zone in an apparent retaliation for an earlier guerrilla attack on
an Israeli outpost, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes, backed by artillery shelling on the ground,
have been intensively flying over the area and the western Bekaa
Valley in scouting sorties since Friday dawn, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
After several days of calm, Friday's air raid came less than two
hours after Hezbollah guerrillas fired rockets at an Israeli Radar
outpost about two kilometers north of the Israeli border near the
Mediterranean coast, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has confirmed the
exchange of fires with Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
The violence marked a renewal of hostilities that had subsided
in recent days as Israel and Hezbollah traded threats of massive
retaliatory attacks against each other's positions.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied parts of south Lebanon in 1978 and carved out a
security zone in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north
from cross-border attacks by Hezbollah, which has been spearheading
resistance movement to oust Israeli troops from the country.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Abolish Executive Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Justice, Constitutional Affairs and National
Integration G.L. Peiris told the Parliament that the post of prime
minister with executive power will be created under the new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
However, "during the period of transition, the executive
presidency system will be further implemented," he was quoted by
the state radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said neither president nor prime minister will be
provided with extra power during the transition period.
</P>
<P>
The post of president and prime minister will remain under the
new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Peiris added that both positions will not be given to a single
person.
</P>
<P>
The ruling People's Alliance government has been trying to
gather support for its constitutional reform proposals since late
last month.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional reform is needed to devolve powers to
regional councils in a bid to end Tamil Tiger rebels' separatist
war which has plagued Sri Lanka since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition United National Party is expected to
deliver its own proposals on the constitutional reform on Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will significantly
increase its total expenditure to target a 7.6 percent GDP growth
in FY2000 on a knowledge-based economy after it enjoyed a strong
and firm recovery in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The total expenditure is estimated to increase by 12.5 percent
over revised FY1999 to 28.99 billion Singapore dollars (about 17.1
billion U.S. dollars) with development expenditure increasing at a
faster rate than operating expenditure, Minister for Finance
Richard Hu told the parliament Friday in his budget statement for
FY2000.
</P>
<P>
The minister said total expenditure constitutes 17.5 percent of
the GDP with operating expenditure at 9.7 percent of GDP and
development expenditure at 7.8 percent of the GDP, adding the GDP
percentage for total expenditure is higher than the revised FY1999
figure of 16.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
While the operating revenue is estimated at 31.45 billion
Singapore dollars (about 18.56 billion U.S. dollars), an increase
of 8.6 percent over revised FY1999, a budget surplus of 2.45
billion Singapore dollars (about 1.48 billion U.S. dollars) or 1.5
percent of GDP is anticipated, Hu noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, The largest share (39.6 percent) of
the total expenditure will go to the social &AMP; community services
sector while the second largest share (33 percent) is given to the
security sector. The economic and infrastructural development
sector enjoys 20.2 percent of the total expenditure and the
general services sector takes up the remaining 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hu said development expenditure is projected to grow at a rate
of 21.1 percent to reach 12.90 billion Singapore dollars (about 7.
6 billion U.S. dollars) while operating expenditure estimated to
increase by 6.4 percent to 16.09 billion Singapore dollars (about
9.5 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that the budget for FY2000 continued to focus
on capabilities building and infrastructure for a knowledge-based
economy as the increases in expenditure are mainly for manpower,
defense,
finance and information technology &AMP; communications. The
expenditures for development of these sectors will increase by 684
percent, 38.9 percent, 63 percent and 117 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the economic and infrastructure development
sector is mainly for development expenditure -- for the
construction of Mass Rail Transport (MRT) lines, reclamation works
and increased funding for R&AMP;D while that in the social &AMP; community
services sector is mainly for education and training.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the government's budget policy continues to be
characterized by careful control over growth in the size of
government expenditure with the total expenditure being kept at a
level that can be sustained by operating revenue.
</P>
<P>
The medium term target is to achieve a balanced or moderately
surplus budget, he added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP Growth Forecast at 5.8 Pct in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's gross domestic
product (GDP) for 2000 has been revised upwards to 5.8 percent
from an earlier forecast of 5.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The higher forecast was attributed to the rapid expansion in
output and export of manufactured goods, the recovery in the
construction sector, and the rising domestic demand supported by
both public and private expenditure, Finance Minister Tun Daim
Zainuddin said Friday when re-tabling the 2000 Budget in
Parliament here.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the economy has recovered and the financial crisis
has ended," he told the Parliament which was unable to pass the
budget when it was first tabled on October 29 last year as it was
dissolved to pave the way for the new general election in last
November.
</P>
<P>
Daim said that the GDP in the fourth quarter of last year
expanded by a significant 10.6 percent against 8.2 percent in the
third quarter and 4.1 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
"This represents a significant recovery given the five
consecutive quarters of contractions, beginning in the first
quarter of 1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the rapid pace of economic growth was supported by
stronger economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
Daim announced that the GDP growth for the whole year of 1999
was at 5.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supports Nigeria in Handling Sharia Violence: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States government has
 expressed support for the Nigerian government in its efforts to
end a riot in the country's northern Kaduna city, the Guardian
newspaper reported Friday
</P>
<P>
"We support his (Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo's)
overall approach to how he is dealing with the problems in
Nigeria," U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was quoted as
saying in Washington Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The clashes, which broke out Monday between Christians and
Moslems over the proposed implementation of the Islamic Sharia law
in the Kaduna State, had killed some 300 people.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to be very concerned about what is going on and
believe that this kind of violence is counter to what President
Obasanjo needs to do in order to be able to take his country
through this important transition," said the U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
Noting that peace had returned to the northern city, she said:
"I'm just glad that it's quieted down some."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is one of the four key U.S. foreign policy priorities
for the year 2000 and Washington has proposed large aid increase
for the country in the hope that its democratic transition can
serve as a regional model.

<HEADLINE> China: Nobody Can Block Work on Outer Space Arms Race Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- No country should use any
excuse to prevent the Conference on Disarmament (CD) from
conducting substantive work on the prevention of an arms race in
outer space (PAROS) and prohibition of the weaponization of outer
space, a Chinese diplomat said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the CD's plenary session here, Ambassador Hu Xiaodi
said as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, the
CD should take concrete measures without any delay to prevent
effectively the weaponization of outer space, prohibit the test,
deployment and use of any weapon systems and their components in
outer space, stop any country from using outer space as a
battlefield and prohibit the use of outer space to strike ground
targets and seek strategic superiority on the ground.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a United States representative's remarks
at the last plenum on February 17 that "there is a broad
understanding" in the CD that the two topics of nuclear
disarmament and PAROS "are not ripe for treaty negotiations in the
CD". The Chinese ambassador said, "I am afraid the majority of the
member states of the conference, including China, will not agree
to this assertion."
</P>
<P>
"As we all recall, the resolution on Prevention of an Arms Race
in Outer Space, adopted again by the United Nations General
Assembly last year, reiterates explicitly that the conference has
the primary role in the negotiation of a multilateral agreement or
agreements on the prevention of an arms race in outer space in all
its aspects and invites the conference to establish an ad hoc
committee as early as possible during the 2000 session of the
conference," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the conference that 87 percent of the U.N. member
states (162 seats) voted for the above-mentioned resolution,
saying only two states abstained, and no state voted against it.
</P>
<P>
"The current reality in this conference is that only a few
countries, even only one country, due to its own outer-space
weapon development program, insists that it is 'not ripe' to
negotiate on prevention of an arms race in outer space in the CD,"
he said. "It is the delegation of this only country that vetoes,
year after year and one after another, all the reasonable
suggestions about carrying out substantive work with regard to the
outer space issue."
</P>
<P>
In this connection, Hu stressed that most countries have their
own impartial opinions and this should be viewed as a kind of "
broad understanding".
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Chinese ambassador said that some U.N.
resolutions had called upon the CD to establish, on a priority
basis, an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament early in 2000 to
start negotiations on a phased program of nuclear disarmament and
for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, other U.N. resolutions also request the conference
to start negotiations on fissile material production cut-off
treaty and other issues," Hu said. "Is there any difference in
terms of priority and importance on the political and legal status
of the above-mentioned U.N. resolutions?"

<HEADLINE> Putin Publishes Election Program in Open Letter to Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin said here Friday that Russia needed a tougher
struggle against crime and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Putin made the remarks in an open letter to the voters about
his program for the upcoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"As we have been talking for years about fighting crime, that
evil was continuing to entrench itself everywhere. A whole
republic, a Russian region, Chechnya, was taken over by the
criminal world and turned into a terrorism fortress. But we
attacked the gangsters and defeated them. This was the first step
towards the preeminence of the law, to the dictatorship of a law
that treats everybody equally," he wrote in a letter which was
published in the Friday issue of Russian newspaper Izvestiya.
</P>
<P>
"Wherever the terrorist and criminal is now hiding, he cannot
hope to find refuge in Chechnya. A terrible blow has been dealt at
the gangster world," Putin adds.
</P>
<P>
The letter consists of two parts: "Our Problems" and "Our
Priorities".
</P>
<P>
Russia's greatest problems are the loss of will power, the
state's loss of will to bring to completion what it has started,
hesitation and the habit to put off the most difficult activities,
Putin writes.
</P>
<P>
This results "in the ancient evil -- crime -- being driven deep
into Russia." "It has gone so far that a whole republic, namely
Chechnya, succumbed to the criminal world," Putin says.
</P>
<P>
He is sure that "it was necessary to meet the challenge on the
enemy's field and to rout him there."
</P>
<P>
Russia's second "big problem", Putin believes, "is lack of firm
and universally recognized rules."
</P>
<P>
"Order requires rules. And it is best for those who are now
busy juggling concepts, claiming that lack of order means genuine
democracy, to stop seeking dirty tricks and scaring us with the
past," it says.
</P>
<P>
The state must set firm and generally accepted rules to ensure
legality and democracy in all spheres including the economy, Putin
says.
</P>
<P>
"The state must begin with itself. It must set equal rules and
comply with them," he stressed. "Only an efficient and strong
state can afford to live by the rule of law, and individual is
freer in a stronger country," he says.
</P>
<P>
The third problem is that the state is insufficiently aware of
its resources, Putin notes.
</P>
<P>
Putin prioritized "the fight against our own poverty."
</P>
<P>
The debt to the elderly should be reimbursed. "It's not just a
social but a political and moral task," he says.
</P>
<P>
Putin admitted that money is needed to "do away with
humiliation by poverty," but "a further ballooning of our already
large social security budget is not the right method."
</P>
<P>
On Russia's foreign policy, Putin emphasizes that "the external
policy should be shaped in the national interests of our own
country."
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the priority of domestic goals over foreign goals
should be recognized, he writes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Vietnamese Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji told
visiting Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien here today
that Sino-Vietnamese relations have been progressing steadily
thanks to efforts made by both countries in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Zhu appreciated Nien's selection of China as the destination of
his first overseas trip after assuming the post of foreign
minister, which itself shows the importance the Communist Party of
Vietnam (CPV) and the Vietnamese government attach to Sino-Vietnam
ties.
</P>
<P>
Zhu gave a positive appraisal of the growth momentum of
bilateral ties over recent years, noting that both countries have
had regular high-level visits, kept improving economic cooperation
and gradually resolved problems between the two countries that
have left over from history.
</P>
<P>
In particular, he added, China and Vietnam officially signed an
agreement on land borders at the end of last year, and bilateral
relations are advancing steadily along the direction as defined by
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (
CPC), and Le Kha Phieu, CPV general secretary.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed the conviction that the two countries would
certainly fulfill the task of demarcating the Beibu Gulf within
the year as long as that both sides work hard in the spirit of
mutual understanding and accommodation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also spoke on the issue of bilateral economic and trade
cooperation, stressing that China will continue to make active
efforts for the promotion of mutually-beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nien expressed his thanks to Zhu's meeting and held that
bilateral ties are developing both "in-depth and width." The CPV
and Vietnamese government, and he himself will spare no effort to
promote the good neighborliness and all-round bilateral
cooperative relations, Nien noted.

Minister Phan Van Khai.

children in his neighborhood were able to attend school. Eighty
percent of villagers were illiterate.
</P>
<P>
Along with a few volunteers, Hou has so far managed to house
135 students in three classrooms, and reduced the illiteracy rate
of the village to 32 percent. 96.5 percent of children are now
receiving free education. Hou was named one of the nation's Ten
Most Outstanding Youths last year.
</P>
<P>
Poor teaching conditions, however, have been a major obstacle.
The school only offers classes up to the fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
Japanese aid will help the school renovate its classrooms and
build six new ones and employ four more teachers. "It will greatly
improve the conditions of our school," Hou said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Registers 5.4 Pct GDP Growth in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economy grew
by a higher-than-projected 5.4 percent in 1999 against a
contraction of 7.5 percent in 1998, Finance Minister Tun Daim
Zainuddin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth was revised upwards
from the forecast 4.3 percent made when Budget 2000 was first
unveiled on October 29, 1999 without passing following the
dissolution of Parliament for new general elections in last
November.
</P>
<P>
This clearly showed that the economy has recovered and that the

financial crisis has ended, thanks largely to stronger economic
fundamentals, Daim said when re-tabling the 2000 Budget in
Parliament here.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the GDP grew by a significant 10.6
percent in the fourth quarter of 1999 in comparison to a marked
contraction of 10.3 percent in the same quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The country's trade surplus in 1999 was 72.3 billion ringgit (
about 19.026 billion U.S. dollars), the largest ever recorded,
said Daim, who is also the executive director of the National
Economic Action Council(NEAC) which spearheaded the economic
recovery measures to haul the country out of recession.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the country's current account of balance of
payment is now estimated at a surplus of 47.4 billion ringgit (
about 12.473 billion dollars), he said, adding this surplus has
enabled the external reserves to increase to 33.8 billion dollars
on February 24, 2000 from 20.2 billion U.S. dollars at end-August
1998, sufficient to finance 6.4 months of retained imports.
</P>
<P>
Daim said that price stability continued to prevail with the
rate of inflation for the whole of 1999 declining to 2.8 percent
from 4.3 percent in 1998.

government is confident about enhancing bilateral economic
relations with Malaysia as both countries had come out of the
crisis, visiting South Korean Foreign Trade Minister Kang Jong Mo
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"In the past several years, Malaysia had been affected by the
crisis and (South) Korea had been affected too. Now, the time has
come. Malaysia has started its economic recovery and we have built
our foundation for the economic revitalization. And by this
situation,we can import necessary items from your country and in
return, we can export our goods to Malaysia," Kang told reporters
through an interpreter after meeting his Malaysian counterpart
International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz here.
</P>
<P>
The total trade between Malaysia and South Korea grew to 29.65
million ringgit (about 7.802 million U.S. dollars) in 1999 from 9.
66 million ringgit (about 2.542 million U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Exports to South Korea amounted to 20.55 million ringgit (about
5.407 million U.S. dollars), up from 5.59 million ringgit (about 1.
471 million U.S. dollars) while imports rose to 9.10 million
ringgit (about 2.394 million U.S. dollars) from 4.07 million
ringgit(about 1.071 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's exports to South Korea in 1999 were mainly palm oil,
natural rubber and animal or vegetable oil or fats while its
imports from South Korea, among other things, were semiconductor
devices and integrated circuits, carboxylic acids, anhydrides,
halides, peroxides and flat-rolled products of non-alloy steel.
</P>
<P>
Various potential sectors such as cement, metal products and
machinery could be offered to Malaysia, Kong who is here on a four-
day visit said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Seal Off All Refugee Camps in West Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 25 (Xinhua) (C All nine camps hosting
some half a million Burundian and Congolese refugees in Tanzania's
western Kigoma Region have reached saturation point and will be
immediately sealed off, the Guardian newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
No more refugees can be accommodated in these camps, the
Kigoma Regional Commissioner Abubakar Mgumia was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the commissioner, three camps, Lugufu I, Lugufu II
and Karago, which the region had set up as part of contingency
plans in case of congestion at other camps, has already been
filled to capacity.
</P>
<P>
However, in the meantime, new refugees kept flooding in every
day due to the worsening security situation in neighboring Burundi
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Excess refugees will have to go to abandoned camps in the
neighboring Kagera Region, said Mgumia.
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday afternoon, 468,000 refugees were registered on
record in Kigoma Region, while another 200,000 undeclared refugees
were also estimated to be present, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the 1.2 million residents of Kigoma region, the
figure of refugees is a little too high for comfort, said Mgumia.
</P>
<P>
He complained the problem of refugees has had a negative impact
on development in Kigoma Region ever since their troubled
neighbors started producing refugees in the 1950s, citing
environmental damage and criminal cases as examples.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sharia Conflicts Put Nigerian Govt. in Dilemma  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Song Li
</P>
<P>
LAGOS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Uneasy peace Thursday finally
descended upon the tarred streets of Kaduna, the capital city of
Nigeria's northern Kaduna State, after clashes between Christians
and Moslems over the proposed implementation of the Islamic Sharia
law had taken away some 300 lives.
</P>
<P>
However, the conflicts around Sharia will continue for a long
time, putting the Nigerian government in a dilemma of trying to
prevent further turmoil but avoid addressing causes.
</P>
<P>
Sharia, mainly implemented in Islamic countries, is a code of
living for Moslems. Apart form its religious contents, the code
is known for its regulations that women must cover themselves, as
well as different sexes must be segregated on public occasions.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of Sharia in northern Nigeria may, to some
extent, be attributed to the wish to correct the widespread social
evils resulted by decades of military misrule.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts around Sharia surfaced in the west Africa country
last October, when Kaduna's neighbor Zamfara State, in which the
Moslem population overwhelms, declared that it would apply the
Islamic Sharia law as state law.
</P>
<P>
"There'll be no stealing or corruption, and people's mental and
 spiritual well-being is going to be encouraged (under the rule of
Sharia)," promised Ahmed Sani, Governor of Zamfara on a recent
occasion.
</P>
<P>
With Zamfara's Sharia legal system officially launched last
month, other northern states, where Moslem population usually
dominates, seemed eager to join the domino game.
</P>
<P>
By the Kaduna accident, Niger and Sokoto States have legally
resolved to implement the Islamic law, while states like Kaduna,
Kano and Yobe were actively considering to adopt it.
</P>
<P>
Despite that the governors of these states repeatedly assured
that Sharia will not apply to the Christian communities within the
states' boundaries, the Christians still felt threatened and
staged severe protests, together with the Christian-dominated
southern states.
</P>
<P>
Sensing the impending dangers, President Olusegun Obasanjo, who
is a devout Christian, had to refrain from acting for fear of
being accused of biasing in a religiously divisive country.
</P>
<P>
Even when challenged to make clear the government's stands on
the validity of Sharia as state law amid the Kaduna bloodshed, the
Federal Executive Council, the country's top decision-making body,
watered down a statement by pushing the responsibility to some
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Nigerians, the bar association and the Christian associations
should initiate legal challenge to Sharia's implementation in a
country, which is secular by constitution," Information Minister
Dapo Sarumi said on behalf of the council Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The clashes around Sharia is sure to take its toll economically
in a country direly need foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"The international community is beginning to regain its
confidence in our nation. We cannot afford to lose the
considerable amount of goodwill that has greeted our transition to
the democratic governance," the president said in a nationwide
televised address Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We need that goodwill to sustain our efforts at reconstructing
the country and improving the economic prosperity of every man,
woman and child in this country," said Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
"What have we really gained from the horror of Kaduna?
Absolutely nothing, except wanton destruction, loss of mutual
trust and belief in the merits of tolerance", the president
decried in his speech.
</P>
<P>
In the three-day orgy of violence that followed, the biggest
market of the city, buildings including churches and mosques, and
several dozens of automobiles were burnt in fire, with some
charred bodies on the streets.
</P>
<P>
In frantic attempts to control the situation, police fired at
rioters building roadblocks on streets of the capital city of the
Kaduna State where the population is almost evenly divided between
Moslems and Christians.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the beginning of the riot Monday, Kaduna
state government declared a "dusk-to-down" curfew, which
stretched, on the following day, into an all-day-long movement
restriction.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops intervened from Tuesday on to help guard the
strategic targets in Kaduna, one of the largest and most important
city in the north of the most populous African country.

Speaking on his first presidential media chat this year on

infrastructure in almost every sector of the economy had been run
aground and needed revitalization to guarantee the welfare of the
people, reported a local newspaper the post express Friday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said the present price of the crude oil, about 30 U.S.
dollars per barrel, was in the best interest of oil producing
nations of the world, though the president expressed his concern
that it might create some problems if allowed to continue rising.
</P>
<P>
"If the price of oil is too high, chances are that the users of
oil will tend to look cheaper alternative to sustain their
supplies, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The continued high price would allure those countries with
marginal oil fields regarded as uneconomical to produce oil and
bring their products into the market to depress the situation, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the biggest oil producing country in Africa with a
daily output of more than two million barrels.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Foreign Reserves Lowest in 10 Months: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The foreign reserves of
Zambia's central bank declined to an all time low in January of
only 77.65 million U.S. dollars since March last year, according
to a newsletter of the commercial Citibank.
</P>
<P>
The inflow for the month was 5.4 million dollars from donors
and the total outflow was 13.4 million dollars, leading to a
deficit of eight million dollars, the Citibank said in its latest
Treasury Letter.
</P>
<P>
The letter attributed the deficit to the debt service
obligation and other government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The debt service obligation stood at 7.1 million dollars,
accounting for 53 percent of the outflow.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, foreign inflow and outflow through the country's
commercial banks also recorded a deficit, leading to a 2.7 percent
reduction last month.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that "as a consequence of the drop in inflows
in January in the face of high demand, the (Zambian currency)
kwacha lost more value, depreciating by an estimated 3.4 percent
during the month in inter-bank foreign exchange market."

 maneuvering space at the regional political, diplomatic level for
the defense of the interests of the Angolan state and security of
the population," the president said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Ignores Death Threats, Vows Criminal Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he will do his work regardless
of any threats to his life.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Putin has received a death threat during
his trip to St. Petersburg on Thursday and the Russian secret
services have information about a possible attempt on his life.
</P>
<P>
"I shall continue to work regardless of any threats, ... I will
tame the criminal community like a dog," Putin told the "Baltika"
(Baltic) radio station in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
However, "I do not like to speak on this subject," he said. "
Everyone should do their own job. If one is not prepared to do it,
they had better not accept it," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He compared the crime in Russia with a dog. "If you are afraid,
it may bite you. But if the dog feels its master nearby, it wags
its tail. That's the way we shall act with the criminal community,
" Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Asked why the Russian military lost the previous war in
Chechnya, Putin said, "the army fulfilled its mission no worse
than it did this time. But we failed to show society what tasks
the army had there and what ideas it protected."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Russian Security Council secretary Sergei Ivanov
said he has no information about a concrete plan of assassinating
acting President Putin but finds such plans possible.
</P>
<P>
"There is general information that Chechen rebels are preparing
such an attempt," he told Russian ORT TV channel Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
He said chances are real and that Russian security services are
taking the necessary steps to prevent an attempt on Putin's life.

<HEADLINE> Deforestation Poses Serious Threat to Africa: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Deforestation has become
a serious threat for most African countries, the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a report.
</P>
<P>
Africa's forests are seriously threatened by civil unrest,
rapid conversion into agricultural land, over-grazing, wild fires,
over-logging and excess cutting for fuel wood and charcoal
production, according to the report available here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, several countries on the continent are involved in
military conflicts, which has made their forests unsafe to manage.
 The growing number of displaced people also ravage forest
resources beyond national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, many forests have been land-mined, preventing
sustainable forest management, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the development of national forest programs has
been hampered by political turmoil, lack of international support,
weak political commitment and the poor integration of forestry
policies into the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Compared to other parts of the world, plantations in Africa are
small and in many cases suffer from poor survival and lack of
management.
</P>
<P>
According to the FAO, many African countries have initiated
policy reforms. In Cameroun, Ghana, Senegal, Tanzania, national
forestry programs have been successful.
</P>
<P>
However, some other countries have been hampered by lack of
political and institutional instability, inadequate technical
expertise and lack of financial resources. Between 1990
and 1995, Africa lost 3.7 million hectares of forests every year,
a deforestation rate of 0.7 percent, more than twice the world
average of 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that Africa lost 10.5 percent (approximately
60 million hectares) of its forests between 1980 and 1995," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
FAO called for a better management of plantations, increased
attention to social aspects and involvement of local communities.
</P>
<P>
Forest plantations are an important element in the sustainable
development of forests and can be complementary to natural
forests, the U.N. agency said.
</P>
<P>
Forests cover 520 million hectares in Africa. The continent
contains the world's second largest reservoir of tropical forests,
after Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africans are relying more than ever on fuel wood to
meet their domestic energy needs, particularly for food
preparation and preservation.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 70 percent to 90 percent of total energy
consumption is coming from wood, and this dependence on the
forests is likely to increase because of low incomes and poverty.
</P>
<P>
Of the almost 570 million cubic meters of round wood produced
in 1994, 84 percent was used as fuel wood. With a growing
population, this trend will continue, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Steps up Efforts to Curb Graft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Any public servant in Kenya
charged in court with corruption should be interdicted immediately
and his or her salary stopped forthwith,  Kenya's head of civil
service said.
</P>
<P>
Richard Leakey, who is also secretary to the Cabinet, made the
remarks at a seminar on prevention of corruption in the public
sector, media here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing top anti-corruption officials, security and judicial
 personnel, Leakey spelt out stern measures such as the immediate
sacking of corrupt public servants and the seizure of private
assets acquired irregularly to deter the prevalent corrupt
malpractice within the civic service.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority
arraigned in court four senior government officials implicated in
defrauding the government of 32.8 million shillings (around
450,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new practice will be different from the old system in which
civil servants implicated in corrupt dealings and subsequently
taken to court were only interdicted but continued to receive half
salaries, Leakey was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to recoup funds lost through shoddy tendering,
especially in the road repair sector, the government plans to
confiscate the assets of culprits, apart from using the courts to
pursue them, Leakey added.

NAIROBI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The HIV/AIDS scourge has cost

<HEADLINE> Cyclone Death Toll Rises to 12 in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the effects
of Cyclone Eline Thursday rose to 12 in Zimbabwe, the Herald daily
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
More than 250,000 people were left homeless and without food
after heavy rains and high winds pounded the eastern and southern
districts of the country.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe Thursday declared a state of disaster
in three provinces that have been ravaged by heavy rains and
strong winds, caused by the tropical cyclone.
</P>
<P>
The three provinces - Manicaland, Masvingo and Matabeleland
South - will have resources in the form of food, shelter and
clothing channeled to them as a matter of priority.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Red Cross has sourced over two million Zimbabwean
dollars (53,000 U.S. dollars) which will be used to assist
thousands of people whose homes were destroyed by the the cyclone.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-general of the Zimbabwe Red Cross Bongai Mundeta said
 distribution of money and foodstuffs will start as soon as
transport modalities have been put in place.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross volunteers had by Thursday been dispatched to the
worst affected areas to assess how relief aid would be
distributed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce said in a
statement Thursday night that "business will soon get to a total
standstill if nothing very drastic is done within the next few
days."
</P>
<P>
The business body added that some sectors of the economy were
already operating below capacity as a result of the fuel shortage,
which has gripped the country for the past three months and has
now been worsened by Cyclone Eline which has cut supply routes
from Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The cyclone, which has been described as the worst in 30 years,
is making it impossible for oil tankers to offload into the 33
kilometers pipeline to Mutare in east Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for South Africa's Unicorn Shipping, which operates
the only feeder station to the depot, said, "our ship is riding
out the storm offshore and there is no hope of anything docking
for the moment."
</P>
<P>
The unusually high water levels in South Africa, resulting in
floods, are also affecting the smooth flow of fuel by rail from
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Up to 70 percent of Zimbabwe's fuel comes through the Port of
Beira in Mozambique, and the remainder by rail from South Africa.

SEOUL, February 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Prime Minister Park

unqualified list for the April 13 parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
Park agreed during a meeting with President Kim Dae-jung Friday
morning to continue cooperation for "steady and smooth operations
of state affairs, standing firm at the center of politics,"
presidential spokesman Park Joon-young said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement confirms Park's decision to stay in the post
despite his party's breakaway from the government.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference to declare the ULD's withdrawal from the
ruling coalition, ULD President Lee Han-dong asked the party's
cabinet members, including Park, to resign or surrender ULD
membership.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition was formed on an agreement between
President Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-pil, who is ULD founder and
honorary chairman, before the 1997 presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Klitschko to Defend WBO Title in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- WBO heavyweight champion Vitali
Klitschko of Ukraine will defend his title belt when facing
Donovan Ruddock on April 1 in Berlin, fight promotors announced
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Klitshko, 28, will take on Jamaician-born Canadian Ruddock, 36,
at the Estrel Convention Center here, according to officials of
the Universum Boxing Promotions.
</P>
<P>
Klitschko has won all his 26 previous fights.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock has won 36 of his 42 fights, 28 by knock out. He has
been once defeated by former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in
1991 and by the current champion Lennox Lewis in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock stopped his boxing career for three years after his
surprise defeat by former WBO champion Tommy Morrison in 1995. He
returned to the boxing ring in 1998 and won all his eight fights.
</P>
<P>
Now Ruddock seemed confident of a victory. "I am strong today
as ever before. The break from the ring was good for me," said "
Razor" Ruddock.
</P>
<P>
"Klitschko is way too slow for me. This fight will not last
the distance. I will finally fulfill my dream and take a world
championship belt home with me from Berlin."
</P>
<P>
Klitschko, however, expressed respect for his challenger. "He
has a fantastic punch and is very experienced. But boxing fans
will see how good I am. My answer will come in the ring," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Private Purchase Spurs Auto Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Beijing-based China Mainland Marketing Research Company and
other research agencies suggested that after a survey of 14 major
Chinese cities at the end of last year that urban residents would
buy some 910,000 automobiles this year, estimated to be worth some
58.8 billion yuan (about US $6.8 billion ).
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the latest survey of Guangzhou, Shanghai and
Beijing revealed that some 70 percent of local families plan to
buy a car within the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
The reform of government organizations and the economic
depression felt by many large State-owned enterprises last year
were the major reasons behind the decline in the wholesale auto
market.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that with the growth of individual bank savings to
5340 billion yuan (more than US $643 billion) in 1998 from 21.1
billion yuan (about US $2.54 billion) twenty years earlier, when
China opened its market to the outer world, there is strong
consumer potential for automobile purchases.
</P>
<P>
State-owned banks proposed private auto loans for the first
time in 1998. Since then, China has also launched an installment
payment method to further spur private purchase of cars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, when China ratified the Traffic Law in 1999 it marked
the beginning of auto toll reform, a step which could ensure
effective control of the toll system.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai and Beijing will take further measures to remove
constraints on private cars in order to stimulate the auto-market.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the auto-industry predict a positive market
development after China enters the World Trade Organization, a
step which would encourage the domestic auto-producers to reduce
their product cost and promote after-sales service. They predict
that China's private purchase of automobiles will enter a
prosperous stage in the coming years given these favorable
conditions.

<P>
CHONGQING, February 25 (Xinhua)-- Private car ownership, which
in the past has seemed little more than a dream, has long been the
goal of many Chinese consumers.
</P>
<P>
Now that the family budget is under control for most people,
many are considering how best to improve their quality of life.
</P>
<P>
"Individuals continue to be the major force behind China's
automobile market", officials with the Chongqing municipal
committee of trade, impressed by the large number of automobiles
in a recent exhibition here, revealed recently.
</P>
<P>
During the latest three-day-long Exhibition of Household
Automobiles, 309 cars and minibuses worth 45 million yuan (about
US $5.42 million) were snapped up by individual buyers. Low-cost
minicars were the most popular choice.
</P>
<P>
"This is in sharp contrast to the stagnant auto-market of last
year when the wholesale market declined," organizers of the
exhibition noted.
</P>
<P>
As an automobile production base in southwest China, Chongqing
can produce about 250,000 automobiles of all types annually,
amounting to 14.3 percent of China's total output.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, over 7,000 were purchased by local
families, growing to 49 percent over the period from 1996 and 1997,
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
"Over ninety percent of our products are driven home by local
residents," said Huang Xiaohua, executive of Chang'an Automobile
Sales Ltd., China's giant producer of minicars.
</P>
<P>
This trend is not only in Chongqing. Guangzhou, the capital
city of south China's Guangdong Province, also reported a new
record number of car owners, 147,200, by local residents in 1998,
up 43.34 over 1997, according to the Guangzhou Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the North Auto Market and the Asian Games Village Auto
Market, the two largest in Beijing, over 80 percent cars were
bought by private consumers, officials of the two markets said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing ranked as the nation's first city for private ownership
with nearly 400,000 automobiles in 1999, the Beijing Traffic and
Engineering Academy said last year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Medical Body Calls for More Hospital  Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The 2000/01 federal budget
should concentrate on funding for public hospitals, the Australian
Medical Association (AMA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
AMA President David Brand said funding for hospitals was
increasing at barely four percent a year while the annual increase
needed to provide the expected level of care was eight percent.
</P>
<P>
"Public hospital funding has been growing at about four percent
a year," Brand told journalists.
</P>
<P>
"The trouble is that with inflation, the aging of the
population and the increase in costs of technology, the actual
costs should be delivering about eight percent extra funding a
year," he said.
</P>
<P>
In its 2000/01 budget submission, the AMA said a better
financing system for public hospitals needed to be worked out with
the key players, namely the state and federal governments.
</P>
<P>
"No specific recommendation is made as to additional funding,"
the AMA said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the AMA demands that the federal government consider
appropriate options for improved funding outcomes for public
hospitals," it said.

<HEADLINE> English in New Zealand Dumped for "Career Subjects" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand pupils are
dropping English in favor of subjects they think will help them
get jobs.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the New Zealand Education Ministry here
recently showed the number of senior secondary school pupils
studying English has fallen from 96.3 percent in 1990 to 92.8
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Association of Teaching of English President Phil Coogan was
quoted Friday by local media as saying the decline raises
questions about the attitudes of employers and tertiary
institutions to the importance of English and communications
skills.
</P>
<P>
Students feel they can get high marks by taking fact-based
subjects, and that these will serve their career aspirations
better, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the time New Zealand pupils reach the last year of the
senior secondary school, they are focusing on their intended
career path, said Frances Kelly, a learning policy and evaluation
manager of the Education Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"We still would want to emphasize that leaving school with the
highest possible level of literacy is one of the best ways that
students can ensure their later success," she added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Monica Seles
recovered from an injured foot and advanced into the semi-finals
of the 170,000 U.S. dollars IGA Superthrift Tennis Classic in
Oklahoma City Thursday with an easy straight-set win over Sarah
Pitkowski of France.
</P>
<P>
It took the 14th-ranked Seles just 42 minutes to eliminate the
eighth-seeded Pitkowski 6-0, 6-0 and gain a spot in Saturday's
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Seles had three service breaks in each set and just three aces.
Her first match in the tournament on Tuesday -- a 6-3 6-2 win over
Francesca Lubiani of Italy -- lasted 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Seles is playing in her first tournament since last September
after suffering a stress fracture in her right foot during a
competition in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Seles had beaten 35th-ranked Pitkowski twice previously -- in
the 1997 French Open and in the 1999 Pan Pacific in Tokyo.
</P>

In the three other second-round matches on Thursday, third-
seeded Amanda Coetzer of South Africa beat Tamarine Tanasugarn of

<HEADLINE> U.S. Steel Group to Conduct Full Range Business Via Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Steel Group, the
nation's largest steel producer, said Thursday that it would sell
a full range of its products through the e-STEEL.com website.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Steel President Paul Wilhelm said he resented the previous
implications that U.S. Steel was "behind the times" in
implementing an Internet commerce strategy, pointing out that some
business has already been conducted via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"It will make sales available to the folks we don't do business
with and easier to those we do business with," Wilhelm said,
meaning there are so many customers who "maybe want to buy through
the Internet."
</P>
<P>
In 1999, U.S. Steel generated revenues in excess of 5.3 billion
dollars, primarily from sales of 10.6 million tons of steel
products.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are forecasting that within the next three years as
much as 40 percent of the steel markets in North America, Japan
and Europe will be conducted via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Currently the e-STEEL Exchange has 1,300 member companies from
65 countries.

transaction involving one player, matching the lowest deadline-day
total of the salary cap era in NBA.
</P>
<P>
All but two teams were dormant and reserve guard Anthony
Johnson was the only player to change uniforms.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Hawks were expected to make headlines today but not
with the trade of the little-used Johnson to the Orlando Magic for
a conditional second-round pick. That was the only deal of the day.
</P>
<P>
The Hawks reportedly were contemplating moving shot-blocking
center Dikembe Mutombo and talented but troublesome guard Isaiah
Rider. Instead, the only move they made involved Johnson, a point
guard who was buried behind Bimbo Coles and Jason Terry.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Mutombo, the Hawks may have felt they could not
get enough in return. In the case of Rider, he may have hurt his
chances of going elsewhere with his repeated trangressions.
</P>
<P>
For many teams, the specter of a 100 percent escrow tax taking
effect after the 2000-01 season may have been enough reason not to
acquire a player with a long, lucrative contract.
</P>
<P>
Players falling into that category who had been mentioned as
possibly headed elsewhere were Juwan Howard, Mitch Richmond and
Rod Strickland of the Washington Wizards, Shawn Kemp of the
Cleveland Cavaliers, and Glen Rice of the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
Beginning after the 2000-01 season, teams are subject to the
escrow tax if total salaries and benefits exceed a predetermined
limit of basketball-related income.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka To Facilitate Foreign Ownership Of New Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Monetary Board
is to effect six amendments to the Banking Act, which will
facilitate the foreign ownership of new banks to be established in
the country up to 60 percent of their equities, Bank sources here
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Central Bank A.S. Jayawardena was quoted as
saying that the amendments will enable foreign banks to
collectively own up to 60 percent but no investor will be allowed
to own the full amount singularly.
</P>
<P>
Jayawardena told the sources Thursday that this move will be
the start of a series of moves which will spur the growth of
financial markets in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
There will also be other moves such as the liberalization of
the Capital Account and the establishment of arbitration centers.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to ensure that foreign investors are
motivated to invest in Sri Lanka's financial sector, he said,
adding that the domestic banking sector could also effect foreign
collaboration with respect to joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The laws relating to banking and finance in Sri Lanka have
undergone many changes within the last few decades and needed
consolidation. It will also ensure greater transparency in
financial transactions of the government and other financial
institutions, he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Hosts Dinner on Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid hosted a private dinner for German Islamic
expert Anna Marie Schimmel on Thursday night, hours after his
medical team advised him to rest and cancel all official
engagements due to influenza.
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing... I am just fine," the president said before the
dinner.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said he realized that he had caught a "cold" after a walk
around the state palace gardens in the morning.
</P>
<P>
"I had a slight fever. Then I had my breakfast and took a
shower. But I still felt feverish. Then I called my doctors," the
president was quoted by national newspapers Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Citing his doctor's diagnosis, the president said he was
suffering from slight influenza.
</P>
<P>
"I then slept till 5 (p.m.)," he remarked with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Moh. Tony Soufyan, head of the president's medical team,
said he advised the president to rest for several days.
</P>
<P>
"According to checks by the clinic and laboratory, the
president had a fever, with a high temperature, but otherwise his
general health was good, with no complications," he said.
</P>
<P>
State Secretary Marsilam Simanjutak said Wahid will cancel his
planned visits to West and Central Java on Friday and to Brunei
Darussalam on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old president was hospitalized for two months after
a stroke in January 1998. He then underwent brain surgery at state
Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital.
</P>
<P>
He was also treated for hypertension in July 1997. High blood
pressure caused severe nose bleeding at the time.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office in October last year, the president has
often subjected himself to a punishing daily schedule and long
hours in his attempts to introduce democratic reforms, fix the
battered economy and end several bloody communal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
As well as extensive tours of many islands across the country,
he's also visited a long list of countries on several whirlwind
diplomatic tours.

<HEADLINE> Mayon Volcano Simmers Down, Alert Level 5 Kept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- After the more vigorous series
of events occurred Thursday morning, Mayon Volcano in the Central
Philippines began to simmer down, the Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Phivolcs said the volcano's activity is now mainly lava
extrusion, compared with Thursday's eruption which composed of
lava effusion, pyroclastic flows and ash ejections.
</P>
<P>
However, the institute still maintained Alert Level 5 since the
occurrence of more hazardous eruption events can not be discounted.
</P>
<P>
The institute said the 6-kilometer Permanent Danger Zone around
Mayon and the 8-kilometer extension of the danger zone in the
southeast sector of the volcano should be strictly observed.
</P>
<P>
According to the institute, airport and aircraft authorities
should exercise caution and avoid the Mayon region if pyroclastic
flow and ashfall occurrences continue.
</P>
<P>
Mayon Volcano erupted Thursday morning, sending lava fountains
and huge columns of smoke to the sky as local residents fled their
homes.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Social Welfare and Development,
more than 18,000 people have been housed in different government
evacuation centers in Albay province where the volcano is located.
</P>
<P>
The Albay provincial board declared the province in a state of
calamity on Thursday to pave the way for the usage of the calamity
fund.
</P>
<P>
The 2,462-meter Mayon Volcano has erupted at least 40 times
since 1616 and its last major eruption was in 1993, which killed
some 70 persons.

<HEADLINE> EU, Rio Group Vow to Pursue Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VILAMOURA, Portugal, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union
(EU) and the Rio Group ended a three-day meeting of foreign and
trade ministers in the Portuguese resort of Vilamoura on Thursday,
vowing to forge closer economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
The 19-member Rio Group consists of Mexico and 18 Latin
American countries.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, whose country is
holding the EU's rotating presidency, described the meeting as "
fruitful" in furthering the relationship between the two blocs.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto, the
present rotating general secretary of the Rio Group, said the
meeting was in line with the objectives of the Latin American
nations and embodied "political maturity" of the relationship
between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
Apart from vowing closer economic cooperation, the participants
agreed to consult on global trade issues and to enhance
cooperation in organizations such as the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese media reported that EU's main goal was to continue
political talks and consultations with the Rio Group on trade and
economic principles hammered out at the Rio de Janeiro summit last
June, while the Rio Group was keen to seek support from the
European group in issues such as environment and human rights.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the EU and Mexico put finishing touches to
a free trade deal expected to be signed by Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo on the sidelines of a March 23-24 EU summit in
Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which will slice tariffs on 95 percent of the
two-way trade by 2007, is believed to allow the EU in a better
position to compete with the United States and Canada which will
implement the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico in
2003.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the EU and the South American Common Market (
Mercosur), which groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay
plus Bolivia and Chile as associate partners, agreed to start
talks in April which also envisage a free trade deal.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the EU has also concluded a free trade deal with
South Africa which foresees duty-free trade between the two sides
in 12 years.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Support for China's Permanent NTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday pledged to do his best to enlist Congressional support
for China's permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR) status, a
decision "once in a generation" his country has to make in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
"We have first got to sell this agreement to the Congress, and
we can't underestimate how hard it will be. I want you to know
that I will push as hard as I can to secure agreement, as quickly
as possible," Clinton said in a speech to the Business Council
here at Park Hyatt.
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of opportunity that comes along once in a
generation," he told the meeting of executives of major American
companies. The decision "will affect our grandchildren's lives.
And we dare not make the wrong decision."
</P>
<P>
Clinton warned that if the U.S. Congress fails to approve
permanent Normal Trading Relations for China, the United States
will risk "losing the full benefits of China's WTO membership."
</P>
<P>
"In a global market economy, your companies will be shut off
from a fifth of the world while your European, Japanese and other
competitors will take advantage of the benefits we went to the
trouble to negotiate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Failure would also send a signal to the world that America is
turning inward. It would be, I believe, a devastating setback to
our vision for the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached between Washington and Beijing on China's
accession to the World Trade Organization is "in America's
economic interests" and vital to the U.S. national security,
Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
With remarkable reductions in China's tariffs, he added, U.S.
agricultural products can get full access to a fifth of the world'
s population, and so will the U.S. telecom firms and automakers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called it "a false choice" that is set up between
economic rights and human rights, or economic security and
national security.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said his experience indicates that "this is time for
the outstretched hand and constructive partnership" in dealing
with China, which has in the past 20 years made progress in
building a new economy and lifted more than 200 million people out
of absolute poverty.
</P>
<P>
"If we pass this up, we will regret it for a generation. All of
out successes and interests will be paying a price far greater
than economic because of our rejection. We cannot allow this
effort to fail," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that it would be a "terrible mistake" for the
United States to totally reject "the profound decision and choice"
made by the Chinese leaders. "We need to embrace their decision.
Not only for our own interests, but for the long-term interests of
the world," he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Propose 11 Sports For 2001 SEA Games  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) will propose 11 sports to feature in the 2001
Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
KONI Secretary-general Rudolf S. Warouw named the 11 sports as
wrestling, Judo, fencing, rowing and canoeing, softball, table
tennis, archery, soft tennis, equestrian events, water skiing and
beach volleyball.
</P>
<P>
Warouw said host Malaysia would likely name 25 sports to
feature in the biennial event. The sports are track and field,
swimming, gymnastics, shooting, indoor volleyball, basketball,
hockey, soccer, sepak takraw, cycling, weightlifting, windsurfing,
karate, pencak silat, boxing, wushu, taekwondo, badminton, tennis,
squash, billiard and snooker, golf, bowling, net ball and lawn
ball.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposal would be discussed in the SEA Games
Federation council meeting in Kuala Lumpur from March 9 to 12,
which he will attend.
</P>
<P>
"We will also hear other countries' proposals to know which
countries want the same sports that we do featured in the event,"
he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
KONI called sports organization officials to attend a meeting
early this week to discuss the country's preparation for the Games.
</P>
<P>
Warouw said KONI aimed to win the overall title after Indonesia
was relegated to third place in the 1999 Games in Brunei
Darussalam.
</P>
<P>
He said KONI would have to lobby other participating countries
so that the sports in which Indonesia had a strong possibility of
winning medals were included in the event.
</P>
<P>
"We have to learn from our experience in Chiang Mai (Thailand)
where there were some sports featured despite their absence from
international sports federation rules," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Warouw was surprise that the council meeting was held
before the federation sports committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Usually, the SEA Games Federation stages the sports committee
meeting first before the council meeting. I will have to call the
federation official on the matter," he said.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia's International Payments Deficit Down in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia's international
payments deficit fell in 1999 to 5.6 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) from 10.1 percent a year earlier, said reports
reaching here Thursday from Slovak capital Bratislava.
</P>
<P>
The Slovak state bank said the result, the best in three years,
would be followed by further declines in the payments deficit,
which is expected to account for 5.3 percent of the GDP this year
and 2.8 percent in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 improvement in the Slovak balance of payments was
attributed mainly to booming exports, which were up 11.8 percent
from 1998, bringing the foreign trade deficit down to 45.7 billion
korunas (1.1 billion U.S. dollars), 45 percent less than in the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala to Appeal to OAS Over Territorial Dispute With Belize </HEADLINE>

<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala will resort to
the Organization of American States (OAS) for the solution of its
territorial dispute with Belize if the meeting starting in Miami,
the U.S., on Thursday does not protect its interests, the
Guatemalan Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
A Guatemalan Foreign Ministry communique received here said
that this meeting "is part of the Guatemalan effort to arrive at a
peaceful solution favorable to its national interests in the
solution of the territorial conflict."
</P>
<P>
The Guatemala-Belize meeting is scheduled to prepare an agenda
and date for a meeting of the two countries' foreign ministers,
and to be possibly followed by a meeting between Belizean Prime
Minister Said Musa and Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo.
</P>
<P>
The communique stressed that Guatemala seeks to strike an
accord on the peaceful settlement of the territorial conflict in
line with international laws.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan authorities have proposed an international
arbitration over their claim to more than 12,000 square kilometers
of land, half of the territory of Belize, which was rejected by
Belize.
</P>
<P>
The land dispute, dating back to more than a century ago, has
caused a series of border clashes between the two countries, said
the communique.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Leader Urges Sino-U.S. Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 24 (Xinhua) -- An American business
leader said here Thursday that trade with China only helps the U.S.
economy and "with China playing by the rules of the WTO, the world
itself will benefit from the leveling effect."
</P>
<P>
Jim Kelly, chairman and CEO of the United Parcel Service (UPS),
the world's largest express carrier and package delivery company,
said at the Town Hall Los Angeles that UPS has waged a campaign to
win the right to fly directly into China.
</P>
<P>
Under the bilateral agreement between China and the United
States, one additional U.S. carrier will begin serving China in
April 2001. Competing with UPS are several U.S. airlines and Polar
Air Cargo.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua after his speech, Kelly said that
China is a good market now and it also has an enormous potential
for going forward. UPS has been operating in China since 1988,
with its services reaching 108 Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
UPS has been arguing that adding another express cargo carrier
into the U.S.-China market which is already well served by
passenger carriers would inject real competition and therefore
help build a sustained economic bridge between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
An advocate of globalization and free trade, Kelly said that "
globalization is not only good, it is inevitable."
</P>
<P>
Globalization is combining with an equally inevitable trend --
the rise of the Internet -- to create a "once-in-ten-lifetimes
revolution" that will turn practically every rule of business
upside down, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that as products today are routinely assembled
with parts from all over the world, businesses must perform a
precise choreography to bring each piece together at the right
place and time.
</P>
<P>
That process is supply chain management, and it might well be
the single most important productivity factor behind the current U.
S. economic expansion, Kelly said, quoting the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
Kelly said that globalization and the rise of the Internet are
good news for small businesses as well as consumers.
</P>
<P>
He also said anyone with a computer, an Internet connection and
an innovative product, can compete for their share of the world
market, adding that the Internet shifts the balance of power in
consumers' favor, at the expense of manufacturers.

SHIJIAZHUANG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The site of the nearly
700-year-old Zhongdu (Central Capital) city was recently unearthed
here, in north China, after two years of excavations.
</P>
<P>
The construction of Zhongdu began in 1307 and was completed

Dynasty (1271--1368), this is the only one that is still well

</P>
<P>
Archeologists have unearthed several palace foundations, city
walls, roads, and a number of art works including a jade dragon at
the site.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the cultural relics discovered represent
characteristics of both the Han and Mongolia nationalities.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Cut Grain, Cotton Production Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Adjusting grain production to
local conditions is at the core of China's strategy to restructure
its agriculture sector, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State
Development Planning Commission (SDPC), have said.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC was quoted by today's China Daily as saying that "
China's crop-growing mix will highlight regional disparities to
ensure a stable supply of major farm produce, while increasing the
marketability and quality of agricultural products."
</P>
<P>
China will continue to support superior agricultural production
in the central regions by stabilizing crop-growing acreage and
raising per-unit yields.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers in the central parts of the country should focus on
improving the output of the lower-yielding fields," Liu Jian, vice-
minister of agriculture, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
China's grain growing area is expected to reach 110 million
hectares in 2000, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The area reserved for grain production will shrink this year in
the eastern coastal regions and the suburbs of large cities, where
more farmland will be devoted to cash crops and export-oriented
farm produce.
</P>
<P>
In regions where the ecological environment is fragile, the
reclaimed farmland should be returned to forests, grasslands or
lakes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will cap its cotton planting area at 3.33
million hectares, and the country's major cotton producer --
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region -- will give up the cotton area
plagued by plant diseases and dramatically cut the acreage for
lower-yielding cottons.
</P>
<P>
The cotton planting area will also be reduced in the Yangtze
and Yellow River valleys, said Liu Jian.

<HEADLINE> China to Limit Saccharin Market to Five Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to limit its
saccharin market to five companies that will control the
production and sale of the non-fattening substitute for sugar this
year.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission has said that nine
other saccharin plants have been shut down or diverted to other
industries, according to China Daily report today.
</P>
<P>
The moves are part of an effort to curb saccharin production to
help China's slumping sugar industry, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, China's sugar industry lost ten
billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) because of price dropping
on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders attribute the price fall in part to mounting
production and the widening use of saccharin in food and beverages
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To help sugar producers, less than 3,000 tons of saccharin will
be allowed onto the domestic market this year, said officials with
the State Administration of Petroleum and Chemical Industries,
which oversees saccharin production.
</P>
<P>
Chinese saccharin producers will be urged to look more at
overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
The five companies that will control the saccharin market will
produce less than 16,000 tons of saccharin this year, compared
with more than 20,000 tons in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sugar industry is seeking to keep production
under 7.5 million tons this year to stabilize prices on the
domestic market. Sugar producers plan to close 143 small plants
this year to meet the target.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay's Economy Down 3 Percent Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay's economy dropped
by 3 percent in 1999, a little worse than what the government had
foreseen, Economy Minister Luis Mosca said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said Uruguay had a difficult year in 1999, with a 3 percent
drop in the gross domestic product (GDP) and a reduction in the
state income of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mosca told the "Busqueda" weekly that the budget deficit made
up about 3.5 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The government had foreseen at the start of last year, when
Uruguay was hit by the Brazil's currency devaluation, that the
economy would drop 2 percent, the budget deficit would rise to 2
percent of the GDP and inflation would remain at between 4 to 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Only inflation answered to the government expectation with a 4.
17 percent rise, against the 8.6 percent of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new government of Jorge Batllethe is negotiating
this year's economic program with an International Monetary Fund (
IMF) technical mission to get a stand-by loan.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said the government would commit itself to
achieving an economic growth of 2.5 percent, a budged deficit of 1.
5 to 1.8 percent and an inflation of between 3.5 and 4.5 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
It also announced big cuts in public spending that will be
around 330 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Italian Think-Tank Predicts 2.5 Percent Growth in Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 24 (Xinhua) -- One of Italy's leading think-
tanks Thursday forecast a growth of 2.5 percent in the Italian
economy this year and 2.8 percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The European Research Center (CER) put inflation at 2.1 percent
this year and said domestic demand would grow by 2.4 percent,
while investments will rise by 5.3 percent and exports by 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the four years to 2003, the country's employment will rise
by 1.3 percent, or 300,000 new jobs, with unemployment falling to
10 percent from its present level of 11.2 percent, the CER said.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that the government deficit will fall to 1.7
percent this year and be wiped out by the end of 2003. As a result,
public debts will drop from 111.6 percent of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) this year to 97.9 percent in 2003.
</P>
<P>
But the CER did not have good news for taxpayers: the tax
burden will stay at around 42.7 percent of the GDP over the next
four years.
</P>
<P>
The CER's forecasts were more prudent than the Italian
government's recent targets, which see higher growth, lower debts
and lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government expects to get its deficit down to 1.5
percent of the GDP this year, compared to the CER's estimate of 1.
7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Enterprises 20 Years Old In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China has now become one of
the world's most attractive markets and overseas investment
destinations since China's first overseas-invested enterprise was
established in Beijing 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Now, the country has a total of 340,000 such enterprises
involving a total overseas funds of 300 billion U.S. dollars,
according to the latest official figures.
</P>
<P>
On May 1,1980, A Hong Kong businessman was allowed to set up an
airline food catering joint venture in Beijing, and since then an
increasing number of overseas funded enterprises have come to
China to become an important part of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Xie Shusheng, president of the China Association
of Overseas Invested Enterprises, overseas-funded enterprises now
make up half of China's total import and export volume. They also
employ some 10 percent of China's entire non-agricultural workers,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, multinational corporations in Beijing increased
their investments in the city's 58 major overseas funded projects
by 1.01 billion U.S. dollars, an official source noted.
</P>
<P>
Besides money, overseas funds have also brought about new
business concepts and management methods to China," trade experts
here believe.

<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Education

the quality of education and deepening education reform.
</P>
<P>
An official with the education ministry said the new reform

encourages the spirit of innovation among college students, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the education ministry said the new reform will
comprehensively alter China's higher education training, courses
of study, and teaching methods.
</P>
<P>
Over 6.2 million college students in China will benefit from
the new project.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education will secure funds from World Bank
loans or other sources to support the implementation of programs
linked to the reform project, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Cities Applying to Host Olympic Games Ought to Pass Examinations First  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Cities applying to host 2008
Olympic Games should first pass a qualification examination by
answering 22 questions raised by the International Olympic
Committee (IOC).
</P>
<P>
During the initial meeting here today between the IOC and the
ten cities interested in hosting the 2008 Olympic games, IOC
Director General Francois Carrard and Sports Director Gilbert
Felli distributed the representatives from the cities the
questionnaire includes 22 questions along six themes:
</P>
<P>
- Motivation and concept, e.g., what is your city's principle
motivation and objectives for hosting the Olympic Games?
</P>
<P>
- Political and public support, e.g., are there laws or other
means in your country to combat doping in sport?
</P>
<P>
- General infrastructure, e.g., what types of infrastructure
are existing, planned, or would be required as a result of hosting
the Games?
</P>
<P>
- Sports infrastructure, e.g., what environmental impact do you
foresee by staging the Olympic Games?
</P>
<P>
- Logistics and experience, e.g., what is the existing and
planned capacity of accommodation in your city?
</P>
<P>
- Financing, e.g., how would the city fund its candidature
activities?
</P>
<P>
The applicant cities have to complete their answers by June 20,
2000. They have also received a 42-page document, including the
IOC Code of Ethics and the procedure guiding the bid acceptance
phase.
</P>
<P>
Through the questionnaire, the IOC will assess each city's
capacity to organize the Olympic Games, the world's largest
sporting event. The IOC administration will collect the completed
questionnaires, analyze them, and report to the IOC Executive
Board, who will meet on August 28-29 to make a final decision as
to which applicants will be accepted as bid cities. The
announcement will be made by August 31.
</P>
<P>
Among the innovations to the process is a candidature
acceptance phase, the enhanced power of the IOC Executive Board to
select which candidates go before the Session for election, the
increased responsibility of the respective National Olympic
Committee (NOC) throughout the candidature period, and the
elimination of gifts and member visits to the candidate cities.
</P>
<P>
Along with the prohibitions against visits and gifts, no
presentations to the IOC or international promotion will be
allowed during this phase. Any breach of these and other rules can
be reported to the IOC Ethics Commission by either a city or the
IOC. Sanctions as severe as exclusion of the city's application
will be handed down by the IOC Executive Board.
</P>
<P>
"The new procedure is concrete evidence our reforms are in
place and working. The rules and procedures are clear and
transparent. This benefits both the cities and the IOC," said
Francois Carrard, IOC director general.
</P>
<P>
"Bidding to host the Olympic Games requires a major commitment
by each city and its National Olympic Committee," said Gilbert
Felli, IOC sports director. "Today we did two things to help. We
highlighted several areas the cities need to focus on early in the
process, and we gave the IOC a mechanism by which to measure each
city's capacity to host the Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
The ten cities interested in hosting the 29th Olympiad in 2008
are: Bangkok of Thailand, Beijing of China, Cairo of Egypt, Havana
of Cuba, Istanbul of Turkey, Kuala Lumpur of Malaysia, Osaka of
Japan, Paris of France, Seville of Spain, and Toronto of Canada.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Could Be Focus of Today's NBA Trading Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Dikembe Mutombo and Isaiah
Rider of the Atlanta Hawks and John Starks of the Chicago Bulls
are among those who may have new addresses after today's NBA
trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
The Hawks, who have not missed the playoffs since 1992, are
struggling at 20-30 and reportedly are listening to offers for
several of their players, including the shot-blocking Mutombo and
the talented but troubled Rider.
</P>
<P>
One report had the Hawks turning down an offer of forwards Tom
Gugliotta and Shawn Marion and center Luc Longley from the Phoenix
Suns for Mutombo, who leads the NBA with 14.7 rebounds per game,
is second in field-goal shooting at 53.3 percent and second in
blocks at 3.4 per contest.
</P>
<P>
Rider is 17th league in scoring at 21.5 points per game but has
needed less than five months to wear out his welcome in Atlanta.
The guard has been late for practices and team flights and was
suspended earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
A free agent at the end of the season, Rider could be waived by
the Hawks, which would allow a contender to get him for nothing.
</P>
<P>
Staks was part of last week's three-team trade among Chicago,
Golden State and Philadelphia in which he was sent to the Bulls,
Larry Hughes was shipped to the Warriors and Toni Kukoc was dealt
to the 76ers.
</P>
<P>
While with Golden State, Starks let it be known that he wanted
to be traded to a contender, but Chicago is the worst team in the
Eastern Conference. He has repeated his desire to Bulls general
manager Jerry Kraus and said he will ask for his release if he is
not moved to a winning team.
</P>
<P>
Starks is making $4 million this season, the final year of his
contract. Kraus may want to keep him for his salary cap slot,
which he can apply toward the pursuit of free agents after July 1.
</P>
<P>
One name that has disappeared from the rumor mill is Los
Angeles forward Glen Rice. Also a free agent at the end of the
season, Rice had been prominently mentioned in trade talks. But
the sharpshooter has regained his stroke and the Lakers are
playing very well of late.
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were five trades at the deadline, including a
nine-player, three-team swap that sent star point guard Stephon
Marbury from the Minnesota Timberwolves to the New Jersey Nets.
The trade deadline is at 6 p.m. EST. The league has been very
quiet since last week's three-team deal.

<HEADLINE> Damascus Radio: Levy Burns Nothing but Peace Chances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy who threatened to "burn Lebanese soil" will only burn the
opportunities to achieve peace in the Middle East, a mouth-piece of
the Syrian government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leaders undermined their credibility as they reached
power under a pledge to establish peace in the region, the Damascus
Radio said in its political comment.
</P>
<P>
It was referring to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's approval
of Levy's recent threats to burn Lebanon and "kill a child for a
child" if the Iranian and Syrian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas, who
are fighting to end Israeli occupation of South Lebanon, continue
to attack Israeli soldiers in the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
The radio said "this means that scourge and devastation have
become the fundamentals of the policy of the Israeli Labor Party
rather than the peace cause."
</P>
<P>
Those who threaten to set fire, kill children, turn life into
ruins and put off the light, are the real enemies of peace,
according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Arabs to support Lebanon to face up to Israeli
aggression.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League will hold a foreign ministerial meeting in the
Lebanese capital of Beirut in mid-March over the recent flare-up of
fightings between Israel and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Report: Israel Consumes 90 Percent of West Bank Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- In its recent report, the World
Bank said Israel and Jewish settlers consume up to 90 percent of
the water resource in the West Bank while the Palestinians consume
the remaining part.
</P>
<P>
The per capita share of water in the Jewish settlements ranges
between 640 and 1,480 cubic meters annually while the Palestinian
per capita does not exceed 156 cubic meters, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The statistics issued by the Information Ministry of the
Palestinian National Authority showed the Palestinians in the West
Bank need 850 million cubic meters of water, 600 million of which
could be extracted from subterranean water.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian population in the area reached 2 million while
the Jewish settlers are estimated at just 160,000, according to the
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report said Israel gets 22 percent of its water
from the Golan Heights which it seized from Syria in 1967 and a
large amount from South Lebanon where it is occupying a buffer zone
carved out in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The water dispute between the Middle East countries started to
take the form of verbal and political confrontations as 77 percent
of the region are desert areas and the water resources hardly meet
the needs of the growing population, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Send Water to Syria During Upcoming Islamic Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Contrary to its previous
practice, Turkey has decided to allow water to flow to Syria from
the Euphrates River during the upcoming Islamic Feast of the
Sacrifice holiday this year, reported the Anatolia News Agency on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey generally shuts down the electric turbines on the dams in
the upper reach of the Euphrates River to save energy during long
holidays. But during this year's religious holiday, the turbines
that generate electricity will not be shut down.
</P>
<P>
In so doing, the authorities intend to make it possible for the
private sector to work during that part of the break which does not
cover the religious holiday, which lasts only four days.
</P>
<P>
In line with a government decision, the usual four-day religious
holiday is to be joined to the previous weekend. Thus the total
holiday period will start on March 11 and end on March 19.
</P>
<P>
Another factor prompting the government's decision is that the
recent heavy snow in southeast Turkey did not necessitate the
closure of the turbines to allow water to fill up, thus permitting
water to flow to Syria during the holiday.
</P>
<P>
Syria used to complain to Turkey during religious holidays about
the closure of turbines which prevents water from running down to
Syria at those times.
</P>
<P>
Two Islamic neighbors, Turkey and Syria have been at odds for
years over water sharing of cross-border rivers.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Senators Repudiate U.S. Ambassador Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Mexican senators Friday
rejected statements made by U.S. ambassador to Mexico Jeffrey
Davidow, who said that Mexico has become the international
headquarters of drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The legislators demanded the Foreign Ministry to present a
diplomatic note of protest before the U.S. government for what
their representative in Mexico said.
</P>
<P>
Davidow said Thursday that the seats of the international drug
trafficking are in Mexico. "In the same way as the seat, the
headquarters of the mafia was in Sicilia, the general headquarters
of drug traffickers is now in other countries, and one of them is
Mexico," said the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican senators said that Davidow's declarations are
completely offensive to the Mexican people dignity, with a clear
interventionist hew, that violates the spirit of binational
understanding that must prevail in the war against drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
It is in U.S. territory where more than half of all the drugs
produced in all the world is sold, since there are 20 million
consumers. "What Davidow said, besides being offensive, untimely,
and with a clear interventionist hue, gives arguments to increase
the anti-Mexican campaign promoted by some U.S. sectors, added the
senators in their communication to the SRE.
</P>
<P>
The senators agreed that the rejection to the certification
process imposed by the United States must be renewed and not
permit, in any way, any pressure coming from that unilateral
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Preventive Federal Police Wilfrido Robledo commented that the
drug trafficking problem "is on both sides of the border," because
there is organized crime in Mexico, "as undoubtedly there is in
the United States."
</P>
<P>
He added that Mexico has a border with the country "that has
the biggest market for drugs."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador Jeffrey Davidow said on Friday
in Houston that Mexico is only one of the places in world having
drug-trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Denounces Honduran Armed Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua on Friday denounced
the armed incursion of Honduras in its waters.
</P>
<P>
 Nicaraguan Army Commander in Chief General Javier Carrion
said Friday that a Honduran Naval Force boat shot at a boat of the
Nicaraguan Naval Force in the Gulf of Fonseca, in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Carrion explained that the incident occurred at 08:50 local
time Friday when the Nicaraguan Army Naval Force boats were
patrolling the line of the first buoy in the Gulf, which is the
only one that marks the imaginary line of the border between
Nicaragua and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
 "The Nicaraguan Army patrol was on a mission of routine
vigilance to prevent illegal fishing in the Nicaraguan waters of
the Gulf" when the Honduran boat made the shot without entering
Nicaraguan territory, said the Nicaraguan officer.
</P>
<P>
Carrion called the shot made by the Honduran Army "an open
provocation," saying there was not a similar response from the
Nicaraguan Naval Force, since the mission of the Nicaraguan Army
is to defend the sovereignty without provocations.
</P>
<P>
This is the second armed incident between the naval forces of
the two countries during the last week. Honduras and Nicaragua
accused each other last Saturday of provoking a shoot-out in that
same area.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman said that Nicaragua will
follow the diplomatic line and international law to face any
Honduran provocation.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan Vice Foreign Minister Jose Adan Guerra said that the
Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry will send in the next hours a formal
protest note to the Honduran Foreign Ministry and will also inform
about the incident to Organization of American States (OAS)
special envoy Luigi Einaudi.
</P>
<P>
"Although we come to affirm and fulfill international
commitments, our neighbor continues provoking us in a dangerous
way," commented the diplomat to the press.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Nicaragua and Honduras are tense after
Tegucigalpa ratified in November a maritime limits treaty with
Colombia, that according to Managua, divests Nicaragua of 130,000
square kilometers of its continental platform in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the two countries agreed on February 8,
with the OAS mediation, to establish a buffer zone in the
Caribbean Sea.

BRUSSELS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Belgium is making efforts to
implement the European Union (EU)'s guidelines in which most of
them have not been put in place, said local media reports Friday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 181 European guidelines, only 20 have now been
implemented by Belgium. The EU has complained about Belgium's slow
pace in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, the government appointed Freddy Willockx to
reduce the Belgian backlog as quickly as possible. His evaluation

others are being contested by Belgium.
</P>
<P>
According to the urgent cases, the most difficult problems are
those in the areas of traffic, public health and agriculture.
Willockx has said this is not due to inefficiency at the
ministries but is caused by the contents of the guidelines.

Willockx has proposed a concrete plan to deal with the issue.
At the same time, he has called for a change in political and

<HEADLINE> WTO Holds Special Session on Services Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Trade envoys from members of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) held a special session here
Friday to try to draw up a framework for further liberalizing
trade in services.
</P>
<P>
The launching of negotiations in services is not only
significant in trade but also important for WTO itself, Director
of WTO's Trade in Services Division David Hartdridge told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that it showed that WTO was back to normal work after
the failure of its ministerial conference in Seattle of the United
States last December. All participants at the session were "
positive and enthusiastic", he added.
</P>
<P>
There is no specific time table yet, but talks are expected to
initially focus on guidelines and rule-making.
</P>
<P>
After the Uruguay Round, WTO completed negotiations on movement
of natural persons in July, 1995, basic telecommunications in
February, 1997 and financial services in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Talks on maritime transport were originally scheduled to end in
June 1996, but participants failed to agree on a package of
commitments so the talks were suspended.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are expected to focus on further liberalizing
those sectors of trade in services and negotiations on air
transport services are also expected to be included in the new
round.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The British Petroleum Company
(BP) has agreed to supply the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe
(Noczim) with fuel.
</P>
<P>
The move may soon alleviate the fuel shortage Zimbabwe is
facing, BP Zimbabwe Chief Executive Officer Peter Theron said in
a statement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that both BP Africa Managing Director Stephen
Beesley and BP Southern Africa head of supply Tim Bullock visited
the country on Monday and Tuesday to finalize the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
They held meetings with Zimbabwean Transport and Energy
Ministry officials, Noczim officials, commercial bank
representatives and donor representatives.
</P>
<P>
However, Theron said that the fuel shortage in the country will
not end immediately because the situation has been made worse by
the Cyclone Eline hitting Mozambique this week, blocking passages
for ships carrying fuel destined for Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the shortage of both diesel and petrol continued to
haunt the country with no immediate solution in sight.
</P>
<P>
At most filling stations around Harare, queues stretching more
than 200 meters could be seen with some stations running out of
the commodities.
</P>
<P>
The fuel shortage problem started late last year and worsened
into 2000 with the government failing to raise foreign currency to
purchase more fuel.

He said the people should complement government efforts in

shelter, blankets and clothing. They have been in the cold for

"We cannot sit and watch while our fellow Zimbabweans suffering
like this. We have to help where we can. We appeal to companies
and individuals to donate generously to this worthy cause," he
said.

dollars
(over 50,000 U.S. dollars) to assist the cyclone victims.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A major outbreak of cholera is
feared as a result of difficulties in obtaining clean drinking
water following the torrential rains and flooding that hit the
southern region of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Ten deaths from cholera have been reported in Beira, the
capital of the central province of Sofala, and at least three
cases of cholera have been diagnosed in the Mozambican capital
Maputo, Mozambique News Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Maputo city health director Olivia Perreira said that all three
 cases of cholera confirmed so far occurred outside the centers
where thousands of people rendered homeless by the floods have
been accommodated. They were reported from two suburbs that have
been inundated and where wells have been contaminated.
</P>
<P>
"For us to prevent a disastrous situation, similar to that of
two years ago, we are to start disinfecting the wells with
chlorine on Friday in all areas that we can reach," said Perreira.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of malaria and diarrhoea, Perreira said that the
number of cases is growing alarmingly, and the health authorities
are preparing to open a special ward for malaria in the Infulene
psychiatric hospital, on the outskirts of maputo.
</P>
<P>
She explained that the idea is to relieve the pressure on the
other health units, posed by the growing number of cases of this
disease.
</P>
<P>
"To this end, we are working with the Health Ministry to
strengthen the staff for that ward, because, besides the problem
of space, we are also facing difficulties of human resources,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
As for the necessary medicines, she said that there are enough
stocks both for cholera and for malaria.

The Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation quoted him as saying that

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Scientists Continue to Search for AIDS vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the Department
of Microbiology at the University of Nairobi are now gearing up
for the crucial stage to test AIDS vaccine on humans, media
reports said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that medical research on AIDS vaccine is not
exclusive to the developed countries. The research by the Kenyan
scientists has already passed the first stage, which involves
animals including mice and monkeys with positive results.
</P>
<P>
The initial stage to vaccine test will begin in December and
involve between 20 and 40 individuals.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said they need the support of all Kenyans,
particularly the government, as the scientists have already placed
the country on the global map of science.
</P>
<P>
The scientists noted that the positive results being witnessed
at the first stages of the research involving animals should not
make the government and experts relax in the AIDS campaign.
</P>
<P>
They also make it clear that they are very far from the final
product and insist that it may take seven to eight years for the
research to be completed.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS disease has taken about one million Kenyans over the
past 15 years.

<HEADLINE> British Petroleum Company To Supply Fuel To Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The British Petroleum Company
(BP) has agreed to supply the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe
(Noczim) with fuel.
</P>
<P>
The move may soon alleviate the fuel shortage Zimbabwe is
facing, BP Zimbabwe Chief Executive Officer Peter Theron said in
a statement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that both BP Africa Managing Director Stephen
Beesley and BP Southern Africa head of supply Tim Bullock visited
the country on Monday and Tuesday to finalize the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
They held meetings with Zimbabwean Transport and Energy
Ministry officials, Noczim officials, commercial bank
representatives and donor representatives.
</P>
<P>
However, Theron said that the fuel shortage in the country will
not end immediately because the situation has been made worse by
the Cyclone Eline hitting Mozambique this week, blocking passages
for ships carrying fuel destined for Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the shortage of both diesel and petrol continued to
haunt the country with no immediate solution in sight.
</P>
<P>
At most filling stations around Harare, queues stretching more
than 200 meters could be seen with some stations running out of
the commodities.
</P>
<P>
The fuel shortage problem started late last year and worsened
into 2000 with the government failing to raise foreign currency to
purchase more fuel.

<HEADLINE> E-Commerce Concentrates in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 25 (Xinhua) -- E-commerce in the regions
of North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific will make up 94 percent
of all worldwide e-commerce in 2000, according to a report
released Friday by the U.S. research firm Computer Economics.
</P>
<P>
Over the next three years, the report said, the worldwide e-
commerce market will open up in North America, Europe and Asia-
Pacific and grow to 9.5 trillion U.S. dollars in transactions by
2003, or about 93 percent of the worldwide total. It will take
another decade or more as well as a lot of funding to grow the Web
globally, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to Computer Economics, online marketers looking to
target their products to individual consumers, rather than
business, should be particularly wary of attempting to build
market share in regions other than North America, Europe and Asia-
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
By 2003, business-to-consumer transactions in North America,
Europe and Asia-Pacific combined will have multiplied by over
seven times the 2000 amount, the report predicted.
</P>
<P>
Business-to-consumer transactions will become increasingly
based in these three major regions over the next four years, so
that by 2003, about 99.9 percent of all B2C transactions will take
place in these regions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The B2B market is more open to regions outside North America,
Europe and Asia-Pacific than the B2C sector, the research firm
said, but companies looking to develop new markets must still use
caution.
</P>
<P>
Companies should not expect to establish many new B2B
relationships in the less technologically advanced areas anytime
soon, the report said, as the major regions will clearly dominate
the B2B global economy with nearly 2.9 trillion U.S. dollars in
2000, and that figure will grow steadily to 9.2 trillion dollars
by 2003.

<HEADLINE> Canada's BCE Offers 2.3 Bln Canadian Drls in Bid for CTV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada's telecommunications
giant BCE Inc. offered 2.3 billion Canadian dollars (about 1.6
billion U.S. dollars) Friday to buy CTV, the country's largest
private broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
The offer amounts to 38 Canadian dollars (about 26.11 U.S.
dollars) per share as compared with Canadian 31.25 dollars (about
21.47 U.S. dollars) a share for CTV's stock at Thursday's close of
the Toronto Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
CTV has said that its board "will be meeting shortly" to
discuss the BCE bid.
</P>
<P>
Other powerful bidders include Rogers Communications Inc.,
Quebecor Inc. and Shaw-controlled Corus, which already owns 10
percent of CTV.
</P>
<P>
But BCE is confident of what it terms as "a very friendly offer,
" saying the two companies have had "a couple of discussions
already" and "management's reaction was very professional."
</P>
<P>
BEC President Jean Monty said Friday morning that CTV would
play an important part in his company's strategic convergence of
the broadcasting, telecommunications and Internet industries.
</P>
<P>
CTV, which owns and operates 25 stations, would be used to
provide content for BCE's Sympatico-Lycos Web portal and its
satellite television service.
</P>
<P>
BCE expects the deal to provide Canadian content "that will
give television viewers and Internet visitors a window on their
communities, their country and the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
Monty said "the convergence of TV and the Web also opens up
unlimited opportunities for e-commerce."
</P>
<P>
BCE is Canada's most widely held company with about 500,000
shareholders.

<HEADLINE> Italy Uses Nine Crystals to Detect Dark Matter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Italian scientists used nine
enormous sodium iodide crystals to detect mysterious particles
believed to constitute the dark matter of the universe.
</P>
<P>
The results of their research, presented Friday at an
international congress held in Marina del Rey, California in the
United States, could represent a historic breakthrough for both
physics and astrophysics, The Italian news agency Ansa reported.
</P>
<P>
It looks like the Italians may be the first to have found the
way to reveal not only the nature of dark matter but a new class
of subatomic particles.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, science has failed to directly detect these
theoretical particles because it is believed that swarms of them
can pass through other matter without a trace due to their
extremely weak ability to interact with this ordinary matter.
</P>
<P>
As a result, these particles have been referred to as WIMPS (
weakly interacting massive particles) or, less jocularly, as
neutralinos.
</P>
<P>
It is believed they are very heavy, weighing 50 times as much
as a proton, and that they could account for the dark matter
astronomers believe might make up 80 percent of all the mass in
the universe.
</P>
<P>
A team of physicists from the University of Rome are making use
of the Gran Sasso National Laboratory inside the mountains east of
Rome for their experiments.
</P>
<P>
The nine crystals used for detection are contained in a
hermetically-sealed copper box because they are pressurized with
nitrogen and to keep out any radon infiltration which might
falsify the measurements.
</P>
<P>
An additional lead shield keeps out cosmic radiation which has,
in any case, already been cut down to virtually zero because the
underground laboratory at Gran Sasso is buried under 1,200 meters
of rock.
</P>
<P>
When a neutralino travels through the detector and hits an
iodide atom, the nucleus recoils and emits a light signal. These
signals are recorded by an electronic device.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, over 1,000 events have been recorded,
according to Rita Bernabei, a member of the Italian team.
</P>
<P>
Each thallium-activated crystal weighs 9.7 kilos and was
especially made by a French firm at a cost of around 40 million
lire (about 20,000 U.S. dollars) apiece.
</P>
<P>
Bernabei said the team expects to get even more precise
measurements over coming months with new instruments and more
sensitive crystals.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Enjoy Internet Boom by 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Italy is enjoying an Internet
boom sure to be consolidated in coming years, but the country took
to the net later than many other industrialized nations, a report
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the period stretching from 1996 to 2001, Italy is
expected to show the greatest average growth rate of all the
industrialized countries: 50.7 percent, 20 points higher than that
in Western Europe as a whole.
</P>
<P>
These estimates were released here by Anfov, the association
for the convergence of communication services.
</P>
<P>
The number of Internet users in Italy will go up from 723,000
in 1996 to 5.616 million by 2001, according to this report.
</P>
<P>
This elevated growth will not be enough, however, to equal
Germany's surfers (going from 2.7 million in 1996 to 16.2 million
in 2001, for an average growth rate of 42.4 percent), or France's
(going from 6.8 to 12.4 million, growth rate of 12.9 percent) or
Britain's (going from 3 to 12.2 million, 32.4 percent growth).
</P>
<P>
With regard to e-commerce, Italy is expected to show
exponential growth, from 0.042 percent of GNP in 1999 to 1.5
percent in 2003.
</P>
<P>
But in 2002, the estimated commerce via Internet with respect
to world GNP will be on the order of 2.53 percent.
</P>
<P>
Free Internet subscriptions helped create the boom in Italy,
Anfov said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 there were 540,000 subscribers. One year later there
were 3.75 million ( up 594.4 percent) of which 2.6 million were
free.
</P>
<P>
In 2001, predictions are that 60 percent of Italian firms will
be subscribed to Internet service providers.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jones Index Closes Below 10,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average closed below 10,000 Friday for the first time since last
April as new economic data added more pressure on interest rates
hike.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the blue chip index fell 230.51 at 9,
862.12. The Dow last time closed below 10,000 on April 6, after
finishing above the five digital milestone for the first time on
March 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Big companies like General Electric, IBM, 3M and Hewlett
Packard led the Dow lower.
</P>
<P>
The index dropped 1,860 points or 15.8 percent from its record
closing high of 11,722.98 and went into correction under the rules
of thump.
</P>
<P>
The broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 27.15 at 4,590.50 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 20.07 at 1,333.36.
</P>
<P>
Stocks plunged as the Commerce Department revised the U.S.
economic growth rate at 6.9 percent from 5.8 percent in the final
quarter of 1999. Investors feared that such rapid growth would
prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has recently warned
that the rates hike is likely unless the economy and stock market
in particular cool down quickly. The warning pushed the Dow index
lower in the past three sessions in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates four times since June last
year in an effort to keep off the build-up of inflation but
Greenspan said these increases have had little impact.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 7.15 at 576.42. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 7.92 at 943.54 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller stocks rose 2.70 at 556.74.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,805 down, 1,163 up and 449
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 1.06 billion shares from 1.17 billion
in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Greece Not to Send More Troops to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos Friday ruled out the possibility of sending more
Greek soldiers to the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, saying that no
extra soldier would be or obliged to go to Kosovo, which has seen
rising violence between peacekeepers, ethnic Albanians and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki,
Tsohatzopoulos said that Greece had sent a force of 1,200 men in
Kosovo. On the basis of the quality and extent of this
contribution, Greece was in third place among the total number of
international powers having sent forces to Kosovo and constituted
a basis factor for pacification in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister predicted that the crisis in Kosovo would continue
for at least another five years.
</P>
<P>
The strong Greek battalion of 1,200 men has been stationed in
Urosevac and Kosovo Polje in the province's south, but a company
of 120 Greek soldiers has been ordered to rush to the northern
town of Mitrovica where two French peacekeepers were wounded and
one ethnic Albanian sniper died in a recent gunfight.
</P>
<P>
Greece is now considering to send 20 police officers to Kosovo
within the framework of the reinforcement of the International
Police Force deployed in the region, according to local press
reports.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou also said Friday that
Athens was concerned over and closely monitoring the situation in
Kosovo with the peacekeeping force for a solution to the problem
and the implementation of U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greece's main opposition New Democracy leader Costas
Karamanlis Friday called for a re-examination of the international
community's policies in Kosovo, warning that the present situation
held the danger of further destabilization.

<HEADLINE> WIPO Registers Record International Patent Applications in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) received a total of 74,023 international
patent protection applications in 1999 under the Patent
Cooperation Treaty(PCT), a 10.5-percent increase on the previous
year's performance.
</P>
<P>
The PCT is a global system designed to facilitate the process
of obtaining patent protection in any or all of its 107 member
states. Therefore the over 74,000 international applications
represents the notional equivalent of some 5.8 million national
patent applications, WIPO said in a press release here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for future growth are also promising in light of
recent fee reductions and ongoing efforts to make the use of the
PCT increasingly safe, easy and efficient for patent applicants
and national patent offices.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming this positive trend, WIPO Director General Dr. Kamil
Idris said, "The continued vigorous growth in the use of the PCT
mechanism in 1999 is a strong indication of the value and
usefulness of this service to the private sector".
</P>
<P>
"The PCT offers applicants a cost-effective and simple business
solution to obtaining protection for their inventions in multiple
countries", he said.
</P>
<P>
Applicants from industrialized countries continued to be the
main users of the PCT, although statistics show positive growth in
the use of the system by an increasing number of users in
developing countries. Inventors and industry in the United States
were the biggest users of the PCT in 1999, with 39.8 percent of
all applications, followed by Germany (14.7 percent), Japan (9.8
percent), United Kingdom (6.4 percent) and France (4.9 percent),
mirroring the 1998 trend.
</P>
<P>
The ten developing countries in which the highest number of
international applications was filed in 1999 were the Republic of
Korea, South Africa, China, Singapore, Brazil, India, Mexico,
Barbados Cuba, and Indonesia. The number of international
applications filed by inventors and industry in developing
countries in 1999 represented 2.35 percent of the overall total
which compared very favorably with 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 a further six countries - all developing nations -
joined the PCT, namely, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa,
Costa Rica, Dominica the United Republic of Tanzania and Morocco.
Two additional States, Algeria and Antigua and Barbuda also joined
the PCT in December 1999 but will not be bound by the Treaty until
March 2000.
</P>
<P>
By filing only one international application, the PCT user can
obtain the effect of regular national patent applications in any
or all of the States that have joined the PCT without initially
having to furnish a translation of the application or pay national
fees.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Executive
Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) on Iraq
Charles Duelfer had resigned, the U.N. confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Charles Duelfer, an American,
submitted a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Thursday,
announcing his resignation, which becomes effective on March 1.
</P>
<P>
Duelfer noted the arrival on March 1 of Hans Blix, executive
chairman of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), which was created last December
to replace UNSCOM in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He offered to make himself available to Blix should the UNMOVIC
chairman find it useful to meet as he sets up the new commission,
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution last
December which created UNMOVIC to replace now the defunct UNSCOM
which has suspended its weapons inspection in Iraq since the U.S.-
led military air strikes against Iraq in December 1998. UNSCOM
withdrew form Iraq just days before the military strikes. Iraq has
barred it from returning.

<TEXT>

<HEADLINE> Honduras Denounces New Aggression from Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Honduras denounced Friday
a new aggression by two Nicaraguan speedboats in the Gulf of
Fonseca, when they shot at a Honduran patrol boat in Honduran
national waters.
</P>
<P>
Honduran Vice Foreign Minister Tomas Arita Valle said that this
incident, in which there were no victims, occurred in the Punta
Condega sector, where there is the only buoy that marks the limit
in the two countries maritime border in the Gulf of Fonseca,
shared by the two countries in the Pacific, according to reports
reaching here from Tegucigalpa.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said that the Honduran patrol boat did not return
the fire from the Nicaraguan speedboats, and that his country sent
"a forceful protest" to the Nicaraguan government for "this new
aggression" against Honduran sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He added that his ministry would report the incident
Organization of American States (OAS) special ambassador Luigi
Einaudi to prevent the incident from causing more problems to the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The relation between the two countries became tense since
November 30, 1999, when Tegucigalpa ratified a treaty of maritime
delimitation in the Caribbean Sea with Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua considers that this treaty takes off 130,000 square
kilometers of its continental platform in the Caribbean, and
demands a peaceful solution to the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Belize-Guatemala Meeting Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The meeting between
Guatemala and Belize diplomats that would have been held Friday in
Miami was canceled because of the detention of three Belizean
soldiers and a policeman.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan Vice-President Francisco Reyes reported the
suspension, saying that Guatemalan security forces detained
Thursday policeman Macedonio Sanchez, Army Lieutenant Ronaldo
Veras, and soldiers Luciano Tisun and Luciano Arana, of Belize.
</P>
<P>
The detentions were made in the southeast of the San Francisco
village, in the northern Guatemalan department of El Peten, on the
border with the former British colony, according to information
sent from Guatemala to the Mexican capital.
</P>
<P>
Reyes told the press that the Miami meeting started several
hours after the announced time because of the detention of the
Belizean military men and the policeman, but that finally it was
canceled.
</P>
<P>
What happened during the delay was that Belize Prime Minister
Said Musa was speaking with Reyes to ask him to release the
Belizeans, which was refused by the vice-president because it was
not a matter of his competence, but of other authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Miami meeting Friday would have served to draft an agenda
for the talks to be held by the two parts, the dates for a meeting
of the foreign ministers, and finally, a meeting of Guatemalan
President Alfonso Portillo and Said Musa.
</P>
<P>
The Belize territory, of some 22,000 square kilometers, won its
independence from Britain in September of 1981. However, 10 years
later Guatemala recognized it as a sovereign state and established
diplomatic relations, without renouncing to its territorial
reclamation.

<HEADLINE> Cyclone Death Toll Rises to 12 in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the effects
of Cyclone Eline Thursday rose to 12 in Zimbabwe, the Herald daily
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
More than 250,000 people were left homeless and without food
after heavy rains and high winds pounded the eastern and southern
districts of the country.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe Thursday declared a state of disaster
in three provinces that have been ravaged by heavy rains and
strong winds, caused by the tropical cyclone.
</P>
<P>
The three provinces - Manicaland, Masvingo and Matabeleland
South - will have resources in the form of food, shelter and
clothing channeled to them as a matter of priority.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Red Cross has sourced over two million Zimbabwean
dollars (53,000 U.S. dollars) which will be used to assist
thousands of people whose homes were destroyed by the the cyclone.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-general of the Zimbabwe Red Cross Bongai Mundeta said
 distribution of money and foodstuffs will start as soon as
transport modalities have been put in place.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross volunteers had by Thursday been dispatched to the
worst affected areas to assess how relief aid would be
distributed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce said in a
statement Thursday night that "business will soon get to a total
standstill if nothing very drastic is done within the next few
days."
</P>
<P>
The business body added that some sectors of the economy were
already operating below capacity as a result of the fuel shortage,
which has gripped the country for the past three months and has
now been worsened by Cyclone Eline which has cut supply routes
from Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The cyclone, which has been described as the worst in 30 years,
is making it impossible for oil tankers to offload into the 33
kilometers pipeline to Mutare in east Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for South Africa's Unicorn Shipping, which operates
the only feeder station to the depot, said, "our ship is riding
out the storm offshore and there is no hope of anything docking
for the moment."
</P>
<P>
The unusually high water levels in South Africa, resulting in
floods, are also affecting the smooth flow of fuel by rail from
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Up to 70 percent of Zimbabwe's fuel comes through the Port of
Beira in Mozambique, and the remainder by rail from South Africa.
