<P>
   But things were very serious for the FBI team stationed outside
the Rodeo. About 9 p.m., an FBI doctor spoke with Vongphrachanh and
learned she had vomited, raising concerns about whether she was
getting enough water. Still, negotiators denied a request from her
captors for gasoline to run the engine and air conditioning.
Surrender at last
</P>
<P>
   Like the entire ordeal, its conclusion was prolonged and fitful.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday morning, one of the suspects tempted negotiators
by repeating, ``I'm coming out in five minutes.'' He didn't. That
went on for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 a.m., Riley noticed that Alcorn had fallen asleep.
</P>
<P>
   He turned to Vongphrachanh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to die; I want to get out of here,'' he said.
``We don't have any water. We don't have anything to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   She emerged from the SUV about 5:15 a.m. Police ordered Riley
out as Alcorn slept.
</P>
<P>
   Between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m., police sounded car horns and sirens
to wake up Alcorn. But progress still was slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still negotiating,'' Lanza reported at midmorning. ``We want
to talk him out of the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 10:35 a.m., Alcorn emerged from the SUV and made a
wobbly attempt to flee. He was quickly subdued, strapped to a
gurney and taken away.
</P>
<P>
   Before officers dismantled the command post, FBI Special Agent
in Charge Larry McCormick appeared before reporters with Gladstone
Director of Public Safety William Adamo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were willing to wait,'' McCormick said.
Aftermath
</P>
<P>
   Displaying a remarkable resilience, Vongphrachanh was soon
released from Liberty Hospital after being treated for dehydration.
By Thursday afternoon, she was telling her story to reporters in
Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, a federal magistrate in Kansas City was
advising Alcorn and Riley to stay quiet about their versions,
unless they were speaking to their court-appointed lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Both face federal kidnapping, carjacking and weapons charges
that carry maximum sentences well beyond life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   And hours after their surrender, both still showed signs of the
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Riley sat stiffly in a courtroom chair, though he answered the
judge's questions.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn slouched forward in his chair, sometimes resting his head
on the table and unresponsive to the judge's questions.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, Jerry Wendt finally returned home after police
barricades came down. He puttered with chores, watered his flowers
and looked for lasting damage from the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The yards weren't torn up too bad where the car went
through,'' he said. ``They look so bad anyway. All brown from the
heat.''

 TAKE 1-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Still groggy, Jerry Wendt stumbled toward the
front of his Gladstone home to answer a doorbell that was ``ringing
off the walls'' at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday. He looked through a window
and was immediately suspicious when he saw a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us to get in our car and back out down the street
without the lights on,'' Wendt recalled. ``Just as fast as we could
go.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wendt wasn't about to open the door. He and his wife, Mona,
had followed the news stories about how people had been
impersonating police officers so they could break into area homes.
</P>
<P>
   So before the Wendts left their home at 5204 N. Washington St.,
they called the Gladstone Public Safety Department and learned of
the hostage drama developing across the street. Police, again, told
them to leave immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time of the morning you don't expect anyone but an
intruder,'' Jerry Wendt said.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the oppressive heat wave that helped bring it to a
peaceful conclusion, the 30-hour standoff over the abduction of See
Vongphrachanh provided a vivid end to the summer of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The event disrupted the lives of thousands of Gladstone
residents and gripped a wider audience with images of the
hostage-takers waving from the shrouded windows of a wrecked 1997
Isuzu Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   And as Kansas City, Kan., police officials revealed Thursday
afternoon, the arrests of accused hostage-takers Jason F. Alcorn
and Lawrence D. Riley and three others may soon answer more
questions about a string of eight home invasions in Kansas going
back to May.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it ended Thursday, the drama had put a Wyandotte
County, Kan., woman, a Gladstone neighborhood and several police
agencies under a microscope:
</P>
<P>
   - Vongphrachanh, a 54-year Laotian immigrant, emerged from the
standoff welcoming reporters to tell the story of her ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   - Gladstone residents gave up their homes, almost without
complaint, to spend the next 30 hours on city buses or in the
stifling heat.
</P>
<P>
   - And law enforcement officers and negotiators, who worked
patiently as their every move was recorded by TV cameras and press
photographers, emerged with their hostage alive and their suspects
in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Police asked Atlas Payne if they could use his home because one
of his second-story windows overlooked the Rodeo. He gave up the
keys in a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thoughts are with the lady in the car and what she's going
through,'' Payne said. ``It must be devastating.''
911 their undoing
</P>
<P>
   The event began at 2 a.m. Wednesday when, according to
allegations in court records, Alcorn and Riley armed themselves
with a Luger and a 9 mm Uzi-style assault rifle and entered the
home at 5406 Locust Ave. in Kansas City, Kan. Three lookouts were
posted outside.
</P>
<P>
   The intruders bound the wrists of Vongphrachanh and her three
grown sons. For an hour they searched the house, but didn't notice
when one of the sons called 911 on a cell phone about 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Police quickly surrounded the house, scattering the lookouts.
According to court records, Alcorn fired several shots in the
house, then called one of the lookouts and demanded a drive-by
shooting to distract the officers at the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   The lookout declined.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to leave, the intruders loaded Vongphrachanh into the
Rodeo about 3:30 a.m., crashed through the garage door, broke the
police line and headed for Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City police picked up the chase about 4 a.m. as the Rodeo
crossed into Missouri on Southwest Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Meandering through downtown Kansas City, the Rodeo picked up
Interstate 35 to Vivion Road. Along the way, police spread ``stop
sticks'' on the road and blew the tires. Wheeling north on its
rims, the SUV turned onto Old Pike Road in a shower of sparks.
</P>
<P>
   By 4:30 a.m., the Rodeo had come to rest on a garden retaining
wall at 5120 Old Pike Road in Gladstone. Officers surrounded the
SUV and called in reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   The siege began in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `I'm going to die, I'm going to die,' ''
Vongphrachanh said later.
Negotiations begin
</P>
<P>
   After clearing out the surrounding homes, police took their
first steps to contact the hostage-takers about 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Gladstone Detective Dave Smith remembered peering from behind a
police vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you hear me?...Hello in the vehicle,'' he called, drawing
on 11 years of hostage-negotiation training. ``My name is Dave
Smith and I'm here to talk to you and resolve this peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   The response was encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to hurt anybody,'' one of the men replied. ``We
don't want to get shot.''
</P>
<P>
   With a high potential for violence, the first moments of a
negotiation are crucial, Smith said later. Smith continued with
simple reassurance, telling the men they had been in the car for an
hour and if police were going to take action, they would have done
it by now.
</P>
<P>
   He offered the invitation to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you guys need, and how can I help get you out of this
safely?'' Smith yelled over the distracting whumps of a TV news
helicopter. Soon, he'd be using a bullhorn.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, the hostage-takers asked for another
four-wheel drive truck full of gas. That couldn't happen, and Smith
settled in for a long chat about why.
</P>
<P>
   ``They banged the same drum most of the time,'' Smith recalled
Friday. ``We'll let her go if you get us the truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk is crucial to resolving a hostage situation, said Gary
Violanti, an FBI agent and hostage negotiator. Violanti, who
eventually would relieve Smith as the front-line negotiator,
declined to speak specifically about the incident because of the
pending charges.
</P>
<P>
   But speaking generally, he noted: ``If a person believes they're
in a crisis situation, we have a crisis, whether we think it's a
crisis or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try not to talk. We try to listen. There's a story, but we
listen for the feeling behind the story. Then we move to the
problem-solving stage.''
</P>
<P>
   But solving the hostage-takers' problems was still a long way
off in Gladstone, Smith noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really didn't know what they wanted,'' Smith said.
Few knew the facts
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City soon woke to news of the hostage standoff. About two
dozen children learned they wouldn't be going to school because
school buses couldn't get into the area, which quickly was filling
traffic officers and SWAT teams.
</P>
<P>
   But the information flow wasn't keeping pace with the tactical
response, which appeared to be going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Because Smith was working with only one backup negotiator at the
scene, he didn't have a third officer available to keep police
commanders informed, which he said is the preferred method.
</P>
<P>
   About 6:45 a.m., Kansas City Police Department spokesman Steve
Young appeared at the command post on Englewood Road for a clipped
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have they asked for anything?'' a reporter asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet,'' Young replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is this happening?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No idea yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they know each other?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they end up in Gladstone?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Were homes evacuated?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone hurt?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, help for Smith was on the way.
</P>
<P>
   At a church just south of the site, where officers could see the
Rodeo, negotiators from Gladstone, Kansas City, the FBI and the
Missouri Highway Patrol began brainstorming on strategy and how to
respond to the inevitable demands.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody needed any introductions. Just a week before, most had
attended a five-day class for police negotiators. The class was
held by the FBI and the North Kansas City Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, one factor in the negotiators' favor was the sweltering
heat, which soon would soar through the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was working against them was they were sitting in a hot,
baking car,'' Kansas City Police Sgt. David Starbuck said of the
captors. ``It was miserable for us outside, but it had to be even
worse in there.''
</P>
<P>
   But using heat or physical discomfort as a negotiating tool can
be tricky, observed FBI agent Jose Jimenez, coordinator for the
bureau's local hostage negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking generally, he said negotiators must watch out for signs
of frustration and erratic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're exposed to this tremendous heat and it may help them
make up their minds,'' Jimenez said. ``It also can become an
irritant and expose physical and medical conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   About 11 a.m., the abductors left the topic of a gassed-up truck
and demanded water, cigarettes and alcohol, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The opening gave the negotiators the opportunity to cement some
trust, though giving the suspects alcohol never was considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bartering will be there,'' Jimenez said. ``It's a
give-and-take proposition. You want to get something for any
demands.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for water and cigarettes, the suspects threw one of
their weapons from the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It basically was a mental chess game,'' Starbuck said.
``They're making moves and you're making counter-moves.''
Heat was extreme
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures soared past 100 degrees Wednesday afternoon. The
atmosphere was stifling in the Rodeo, whose windows were shrouded
with black spray paint and blankets. Turning on the engine for a
few moments at a time, the two abductors and hostage got some
air-conditioning relief, but it never lasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car has to be extremely hot,'' observed Jeff Lanza, a
spokesman for the FBI, which had overall command of the operation.
``It has to be 100 degrees or more in that car. People have to be
exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks with the occupants of the Rodeo moved in fits and starts,
Starbuck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It varied. There were times when negotiators would back off
and let them calm down,'' Starbuck said. ``There were lots of
periods of non-communication.''
</P>
<P>
   With negotiations threatening to extend past sunset, commanders
delivered a telephone to the Rodeo with a water shipment just after
5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of yelling, they have decent communications,'' Lanza
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations couldn't move quickly enough for Jerry and Mona
Wendt. In the 14 hours since being rousted from their home, they
had gone to their nephew's house and spent the time cleaning it.
Hoping for a resolution to the hostage incident, they returned to
the command post about 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But no resolution was in sight. So, suffering from a headache
and dressed in the same T-shirt and shorts he was wearing at 4:30
a.m., he and his wife sought shelter with other families in an
air-conditioned municipal bus.
</P>
<P>
   The heat was on everyone's mind. As evening approached,
temperatures seemed to drop, but at 8 p.m. a police officer at the
command post announced it was still 95 degrees. At the Red Cross
truck a worker urged people to drink every half hour and eat potato
chips for salt.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I have a few more apples, ma'am?'' asked a tactical
officer, outfitted in black with a mask, helmet and bullet-proof
vest. He stuffed his pockets with three green apples, holding his
rifle close to his side.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the parking lot a newsman lounged in a collapsible
lawn chair near a news van.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must be nice,'' a police officer said, walking past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting for the barbecue,'' a reporter said.
</P>
<P>
   But things were very serious for the FBI team stationed outside
the Rodeo. About 9 p.m., an FBI doctor spoke with Vongphrachanh and
learned she had vomited, raising concerns about whether she was
getting enough water. Still, negotiators denied a request from her
captors for gasoline to run the engine and air conditioning.

THIS LITTLE PORKER HAS BEEN PRETTY LUCKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERICA WOOD, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ This little piggy has a serious lucky streak.
</P>
<P>
   The pig, Howie, was adopted after surviving a July 3 fall from a
tractor-trailer on Interstate 70 and a possible trip to market. He
now lives on 60 acres with more than 86 other animals, including
three potbellied pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Animal-rights advocate Paul Rebein came across the 5-month-old
porker July 22 at the Kansas City animal-control center while
looking for dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came around the corner and saw a baby pig (in a cage) with
dogs,'' Rebein said. ``I walked back and put my hand in the cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he licked it, it seemed like fate. I wasn't going to
leave him there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebein, a Kansas City resident, said he was told by a person at
the animal-control center that he could not keep the pig in the
city. So, Rebein said, he had a friend, who owns 2 acres just
outside Lawrence, Kan., adopt the pig.
</P>
<P>
   Howie made himself a temporary home in Mark von Schlemmer's
garden _ turning over a water-filled tub until it became a mud pit.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month Rebein found Howie a permanent home with Carol
Green.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who lives near Parkville, was happy to take Howie. Many
of her animals were rescued from uncertain fates as dinner or, in
the case of her buffalo, wall mounts.
</P>
<P>
   Howie found solace among three goats, seven sheep, seven
chickens, 25 buffaloes, 25 longhorn cows and calves, 16 horses,
three potbellied pigs and an assortment of peacocks, chickens,
ducks and geese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think he didn't fall (from the truck),'' Rebein
said. ``He jumped.''

INCENTIVE PACKAGE COULD EXPAND MENNINGER CLINIC'S PRESENCE IN KCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH and ALAN BAVLEY, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ]KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A public-private consortium is proposing an
incentive package worth as much as $100 million to persuade the
world-renowned Menninger Clinic to stay in Kansas and form a
partnership with the University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas
Gov. Bill Graves said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal includes the establishment of a brain research
center near the medical center's Kansas City, Kan., campus, and
possibly a freestanding mental health treatment center.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is being mounted amid heightened area interest in
life sciences research, propelled by the scheduled opening of the
Stowers Institute for Medical Research around Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name Menninger has been synonymous with the state of
Kansas, and is synonymous with world-class psychiatric research,
education and care,'' Graves said in a phone interview. ``The state
wants to step up and be involved in maintaining their presence
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Menninger, which employs about 1,000 people in Topeka and about
400 in the Kansas City area, said earlier this year that it was
considering closing its spacious Topeka campus as it struggles to
reverse financial losses.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, the institution has been exploring alliances
with the KU Medical Center, Baylor College of Medicine in Houston
and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas,
officials with the three schools said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university is very excited about the prospect of making
this happen,'' said Dennis McCulloch, a spokesman for KU Medical
Center. ``Any time you have solid research, it adds to the
reputation of this area as a center for life sciences.''
</P>
<P>
   McCulloch said a brain research center, if built, probably would
be located near the medical campus. He declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespersons for Baylor and UT Southwestern said they have been
in talks with Menninger, but they declined to provide details.
</P>
<P>
   Menninger spokesman Pat Burnau confirmed that talks are going on
with the KU Medical Center but declined to provide details or
discuss the talks with other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confidentiality agreements with the institutions and
groups we are talking with now,'' Burnau said.
</P>
<P>
   A decision could be made soon. The Menninger board of directors
is expected to meet in mid-September, and its larger board of
trustees is scheduled to meet Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Word of a possible collaboration with Menninger drew a positive
response from KU Medical Center neurologist Richard Dubinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really sounds great,'' Dubinsky said. ``Menninger
certainly has a great reputation in the mental health field.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubinsky, who studies movement disorders including Huntington's
disease and Tourette's syndrome, said his work significantly
overlaps with work done by Menninger psychiatrists. ``To be able to
call upon their expertise would greatly benefit our efforts,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Building KU Medical Center's research programs in neurosciences
has long been a campus priority, sources at the medical center
said. And development of a neurosciences institute has been under
discussion by medical center officials for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed institute on the medical center campus would
integrate medical care, clinical research and basic science
research. The institute also would work closely with researchers on
KU's main campus in Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting additional faculty to the medical center's neurology
department is one of the first tasks being undertaken by the
department's new chairman, Richard Barohn.
</P>
<P>
   Barohn is coming to KU from the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center, where he has been acting chairman of the neurology
department. He is an expert on neuromuscular diseases, such as
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. At KU, he is expected to expand
research at the medical center and develop ties with researchers in
Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Graves said the incentive package is being proposed by a group
including the medical center; Bill Hall, president of the Hall
Family Foundation; and the Kansas City Area Development Council.
Hall could not be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Marcusse, president and chief executive officer of the
Kansas City Area Development Council, said the incentive package
had been submitted to Menninger on Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Marcusse declined to comment on the brain research center or
other specifics of the proposal, but said a KU-Menninger
partnership could be a ``wonderful tie-in'' with the effort to
augment life sciences research in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's one of the things that attracted Menninger to
Kansas City,'' Marcusse said.
</P>
<P>
   Menninger's financial problems are occurring as mental health
facilities around the country deal with shorter inpatient stays,
partly because of tighter reimbursements from managed-care
companies and government health programs. An inpatient is someone
who stays in a hospital or clinic for at least 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, modern medications have lessened the need for long
inpatient stays in psychiatric facilities. The result is that
psychiatric hospitals have been closing.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas has long taken pride in the Menninger Clinic, which was
founded by C.F. Menninger and two of his sons, Will and Karl, in a
Topeka, Kan.-area farmhouse in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Together they sought to treat mental illness with missionarylike
zeal. The world's top psychiatrists flocked there to work and
learn.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic has been consistently ranked as one of the nation's
top psychiatric care providers in surveys of America's best
hospitals by U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
</P>
<P>
   Movie stars and sports celebrities from around the country have
received treatment at the Menninger Clinic. But Graves said it also
has helped many Kansans, and it would be a big blow if the
institution left the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``These other communities (in Texas) have obviously put packages
together and made presentations as well,'' Graves said. ``I don't
think we should build up expectations that this will be easy to
accomplish. It will be difficult. But we have submitted a good,
solid package.''

PRAYER COMES FIRST, BUT FOOTBALL GAME IS THE MAIN EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, Texas _ Despite talk of a huge rally of prayer and
protest, it was cheers for the boys in cleats that took center
stage Friday night under the lights at the high school football
field here.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans quietly recited The Lord's Prayer before the start of
the game, an action designed partly to protest the Supreme Court
ruling in June that forbade a pre-game prayer routine led by
students. But most of the noise came from clapping hands and shouts
for the young football players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd is much, much, much smaller than we had feared it
would be,'' said Gary Causey, the principal at Santa Fe High
School, who noted that the school had more than two dozen fire
trucks and ambulances on hand, in preparation for an overwhelming
crowd of praying protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' Causey added, ``it's a much smaller crowd than we'd
expect for an opening-night game. I think a lot of the locals
stayed home because they didn't want to deal with a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, perhaps a few hundred out-of-towners attended the
game to make a point, many of them wearing shirts with religious
inscriptions. Outside the football field fence, a group of about
two dozen people sang hymns, while two men shouldered wooden
crosses.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that an overwhelming majority of people here
supported the right to pray at the game, even if they did not join
in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a defense of Christianity, basically,'' said John
Patteson, a 65-year-old retired construction worker.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Taggart, a 40-year-old truck driver, said, ``It's not about
praying anymore. It's about our rights and freedoms being taken
away.''
</P>
<P>
   A group called No Pray, No Play had sent e-mail messages around
Texas, encouraging people to come to Santa Fe and pray. And many
people here, from Santa Fe and beyond, wore shirts inscribed with
Bible verses. The high school booster club had shirts printed up
with the wording ``Gotta Believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone in attendance said they were offended by the
overtly religious signs and praying at a football game.
</P>
<P>
   But Candy Gerulis, a 43-year-old hair stylist from Santa Fe, was
one who said the scene bothered her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy,'' said Gerulis, who was raised Catholic. ``It
makes me feel uncomfortable to have people stand up and start
praying around me at a football game.''
</P>
<P>
   The game Friday night _ between the Santa Fe Indians and the
Hutchinson Bulldogs, which Santa Fe won 21-14 _ was the first in
town after the the Supreme Court ruling that prohibited the
pre-game prayers led by students in a ritual that amounted to an
official ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 majority opinion by Jus- tice John Paul Stevens said
that even when attendance at a game was vol- untary and even when
the decision to pray was made by students instead of
school-district officials, ``the deliv- ery of a pre-game prayer
has the improper effect of coercing those present to participate in
an act of  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  religious worship'' and violated
the Constitution's ban on state promo- tion of religion.
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars generally agreed that the latest tack _ prayers
led by people in grandstands, with no formal ties to the school _
probably falls within the framework of protected speech.
</P>
<P>
   While prayer at football games enjoys overwhelming support in
Santa Fe, some local people have expressed misgivings about the
pregame prayers being used by groups from out of town interested in
making political hay.
</P>
<P>
   A local pastor who was a supporter of the prayers, the Rev.
Eugene Easterly, said that the prayers were meant to be ``a simple
expression of faith,'' not a forum for disgruntled religious
leaders from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Prayers have been featured at football games and venues in
several Southern towns and cities recently.
</P>
<P>
   In Asheville, N.C., more than 25,000 people gathered last month
at a high school football stadium in an event sponsored by a group
called ``We Still Pray.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, prayer organizers have tried to abide by the
court ruling by bypassing school administrators.
</P>
<P>
   But some districts have fairly flouted the court ruling. In
Batesburg-Leesville, S.C., the student body president recently
recited a prayer over the public address system before a football
game. The school board in Searcy, Ark., voted to allow a Christian
group to hold prayers around a flagpole before games.
</P>
<P>
   Around Santa Fe, the football prayer issue has become a matter
of intense civic pride. At the entrance to town on Farm Road 646, a
sign reads ``We Still Pray in Santa Fe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Busy Bee Cafe has a sign that reads, ``Good Luck Indians and
God Bless America.'' And the Cowboy barbecue restaurant has a sign
of support to the football team and fans, ``Our Prayers Are With
You.''

TOO OFTEN, TAXPAYERS ACCEPT THEIR FATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ If this is summer's last long weekend, it
must be time to dip into the ol' mailbag and let the readers do the
writing. First up is a Johnson Countian miffed about how homes are
appraised for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (appraisal) method is unfair to property owners because
the increases (in value) are based upon property that has been sold
recently. Why is it unfair? Because most homes for sale have been
put in top condition to bring the best price...because not many
homes are alike, (and) without a physical inspection of each
property...an accurate comparison cannot be made...I would like
your comments.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Mad As Heck: You're absolutely right, of course. My
personal reckoning convinces me that my home is probably
overappraised because an erstwhile neighbor got lucky in a seller's
market a while back and scored an eager buyer willing to pay top
dollar. Chalk it up to being one of the joys of living in the
Golden Ghetto _ just like those wasted hours you must endure in the
motor vehicle registration offices waiting to fork over more taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of JoCo's motor vehicle puzzle palace, here's a
testimonial from another satisfied customer following a recent
Uncle Fearless rant on same.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hit the nail on the head. I moved to Johnson County in
1993 and thought the whole motor vehicle process a disaster. It is
truly amazing how the taxpayers are so well-behaved. The county
makes you wait, takes your money and makes you feel stupid, all at
the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Perceptive: The key is lack of customer outrage. As long as
taxpayers accept their wretched fate without complaint and re-elect
government stewards indifferent to the needs of constituents,
nothing will change.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of things related the internal combustion engine,
recent columns analyzing petrol price spikes got a Liberty motorist
to thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``While your article deals with facts on government intervention
causing much of the increase in gas prices...you failed to mention
that oil company profits have soared. Are you sure you're not
running for political office? You talk like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Curious: Perish the thought. Even thinking about being in
politics makes me break out in hives. As for oil company profits,
it is indeed true the industry's earnings numbers for the most
recent quarter are impressive. It must be remembered, however,
profits have been relatively skinny in the oil patch for a long
time. Through the mid-1990s oil company profits averaged only about
half of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 average, and last year's first
half was a bad one for the industry because of especially bad
business conditions. Commerce is a two-way street. Sometimes the
buyer has the advantage; sometimes the seller does. As for the
earnings spike, if oil companies can't make a decent profit from
time to time, there's not much incentive to drill for oil and
refine it into gasoline, heating oil and the other petrol products
on which we're so critically dependent. Just because politicians
and so-called consumer advocates like to score brownie points by
bashing out-of-favor industries like Big Oil doesn't mean they know
what they're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Keep them cards and letters comin', hear?

INTERSTATE BAKERIES RATED AT LOWEL LEVEL OF INVESTMENT GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Interstate Bakeries Corp. recently asked
Moody's Investors Service to give it a debt rating and on Friday
got its answer when it received a Baa3, the lowest rating available
that's still considered investment grade.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate executives went to New York last month, visited
Moody's and Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp., and asked for ratings as it
began an extensive refinancing of its debt. As part of the
refinancing, Interstate is considering going to the public markets.
</P>
<P>
   But because the company has never had such debt, it has never
had a corresponding rating. Standard &AMP; Poor's is expected to issue
its rating next week. With a higher debt rating, a company can pay
bond buyers a lower return.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's analyst Peter H. Abdill said that of the rating
company's 19 grades, Interstate's falls in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last level of investment grade that there is,''
Abdill said. ``One notch lower, and it would have been a junk
rating.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news, Abdill said, is that Interstate is a solid
company with relatively low debt and good cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news, he said, is that its business _ selling white
bread and sweets _ is very competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted, they sell a lot of white bread, and while it's (a
branded product), it still comes pretty close to being a
commodity,'' Abdill said.
</P>
<P>
   Abdill, in coming up with the rating, also noted the substantial
changes the company was going through. For one, the company is
spending $243 million to buy 15.5 million shares of its common
stock from Ralston Purina Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston owns a large chunk of Interstate as a result of
Interstate's stock-and-cash purchase of Continental Baking Co. in
1995, then a Ralston subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted the $120 million punitive damages award hanging
over the company as a result of a racial discrimination case in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company is appealing the award, Abdill said there
was no certainty as to the outcome of the case. Therefore, he
factored it in on a worst-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate has a $610 million, 364-day revolving credit facility
that expires on July 30, 2001. It also has a $350 million revolving
credit line that expires on Feb. 25, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge facing Interstate as it refinances its balance
sheet, Abdill said, is migrating a large chunk of its debt from
short-term credit facilities to long-term borrowings.
</P>
<P>
   Although Abdill thinks Interstate is being prudent in its plans,
it's tricky because the company is not well-known in the public
debt arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't issued bonds before, so they're going to go to a
market that would buy those bonds _ mostly mutual funds and
insurance companies _ that may not be that familiar with them,''
Abdill said. ``The market might not be receptive, so what happens
if they have problems placing that debt?''
</P>
<P>
   Interstate spokesman Paul Yarick said the company was pleased it
received an investment grade rating. He said the company was
considering several options to refinance its debt, including
issuing bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that we've come to the market and would
hope that as our performance improves that the ratings will likely
be improved,'' Yarick said. ``But for now, it is investment grade,
and that is the key for us.''

MAN SHARES GOD'S MESSAGE WITH PARTY COVE REVELERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSAGE BEACH, Mo. _ The Lake of the Ozarks resembles a cattle
drive as boats stream to Party Cove. Aboard minister Mark Hott's
houseboat, members of a church band raise their voices to the
heavens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrate Jesus. Celebrate!'' they sing. ``Jesus is risen!''
</P>
<P>
   A red-faced, shirtless carouser floats by. Blame the waves, or
the drinks, but he is wobbling. He struggles to focus on the perky
lead singer.
</P>
<P>
   At song's end, Hott grabs the microphone and asks for applause.
The reveler's reply is hardly an amen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get naked!'' he wails.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hott: ``No one said this was going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Party Cove, a notorious haven for hedonism. Each summer
weekend, hundreds tie their smoke-belching boats together in the
cove. As the day devolves into a maelstrom of sun, booze and music,
caution _ and clothing _ are thrown to the wind.
</P>
<P>
   All summer, Mark and Denise Hott have boarded their ministry's
houseboat and brought the word of God into this den of decadence.
</P>
<P>
   They've seen it all. Heckling. Laughing. One group flung water
balloons at the boat. Some protest with the finger and other body
parts.
</P>
<P>
   But many boaters at Lake of the Ozarks have accepted the Hotts.
Most smile and wave. A few even come aboard to find out more.
</P>
<P>
   As vice and virtue do battle at this mid-Missouri lake, Hott
believes that some will be drawn to his message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have good and evil out here, if you will,'' Hott said as he
ate a sandwich on the boat's top deck. ``But our job is not to
condemn them or criticize them. We just want to show them there is
another way.''
</P>
<P>
   But it would take a message stronger than Bagnell Dam to stem
the popularity of Party Cove.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, the cove has been a mecca for booze, boats
and women. The party zone now is entrenched in a nook near the Lake
of the Ozarks State Park.
</P>
<P>
   For years, entrepreneurs have even taken to taping the cove's
antics and selling videos on the Internet. One ad promises ``large
amounts of nudity, adult activities, alcohol consumption and just
plain great fun.''
</P>
<P>
   A pontoon boat tootles by. A hastily written banner touts
daiquiris for sale and a bikini contest at a lakefront bar.
</P>
<P>
   So why would a man of faith wade into this?
</P>
<P>
   Hott has a simple explanation: God told him to. Hott said he
felt the call after a sermon by minister Kenneth Copeland.
</P>
<P>
   Hott, a longtime Osage Beach real-estate developer, bought his
new pulpit from a Kentucky boat dealer. A discount lowered the
price to $175,000. Hott bought the boat with his savings and a
loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``God negotiated the whole sale,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Since Memorial Day, Hott, friends and other ministers have
boarded the two-story houseboat known as ``Hot! Hot! Hot!'' They
anchor at the entrance to the cove and watch the watercraft float
by. Most of the R-rated material is farther into the cove, out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Some weekends, bands play on the upper level. Other times,
recorded music and Hott's sermons blare from the speakers.
Inspirational words scroll by on a message board. Hott holds
services on Sunday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   Hott is not affiliated with a church. He confines his work to
the boat, including retreats for other ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Ten persons have been ``saved'' this summer _ Hott's goal is to
increase that. To be saved, Hott said, ``all you have to say is,
`Jesus, I believe you died, I believe I am a sinner, I believe you
rose from the grave and I believe you are here today.' It's that
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Hott, 43, is realistic. He doesn't expect the wave of partiers
to trade their beers for Bibles right away. As a youth, he liked to
dance and drink, too. He can't deny that Party Cove is probably a
lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sin is fun,'' he said, ``but the consequences aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Stutesman, a pastor at Sunrise Bible Church in Sunrise
Beach who sometimes joins Hott on the boat, compares him to
missionaries in foreign lands. It's important not to try to change
the native cultures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the ministry isn't trying to abolish Party Cove.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't come to point fingers,'' Stutesman said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday, John and Lori Albrecht of Affton, Mo.,
whizzed by out of curiosity. After about an hour on Hott's boat,
they were impressed with how mellow the ministry was. Visitors
sipped lemonade and munched on potato chips while music played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to hand it to him. I don't know if I could do it,''
John Albrecht said. ``It's a tough crowd out here. I think it helps
that they're not trying to cram the message down anybody's
throat.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministry boasts two assets as it tries to fit in with Party
Cove culture: a jaw-dropping boat and a killer sound system.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-foot houseboat comfortably sleeps 10. The main cabin
features a kitchen with modern appliances. Coolers overflow with
iced tea, soda and other nonalcoholic drinks.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that when the group's vocalist sings about the ``rock
of ages,'' she isn't referring to the spleen-busting Def Leppard
tune. But the sound system sends the Christian music across the
water, clearly audible over the low moans of speeding motorboats.
</P>
<P>
   The music draws boaters in.
</P>
<P>
   Then they hear the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Rock of ages,
</P>
<P>
   Jesus is the rock.
</P>
<P>
   There is no rock,
</P>
<P>
   there is no God like ours.
</P>
<P>
   The boaters don't exactly raise lighters in tribute.
</P>
<P>
   One bleary-eyed man emerges from a boat's bottom deck, like a
vampire, and hears the music. He hollers his own request: ``Play
some Limp Bizkit!''
</P>
<P>
   A woman in a tight gray halter top starts dancing to the music
and turns up her own stereo, hoping Madonna's ``Into the Groove''
can overwhelm the band on Hott's boat. She crosses herself in mock
piety.

   Another wiseacre exclaims: ``Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!'' In a
soft voice, a passenger on Hott's boat answers: ``Amen.''

   At least a dozen partiers have dropped their bathing trunks.
With one drunkard, Hott didn't miss a beat. ``God loves that bare

   Hott said the taunts don't bother him. He says the results of
his ministry might not be known for months, maybe years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've reached one person, that's a success. Who knows? The
next Billy Graham might be down there in Party Cove.'' Even if he
isn't, Hott is convinced of one thing: ``This is where God wants me
to be.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On an increasing number of occasions, Venus Williams'
opponents have timidly stepped on the court and immediately
searched for a foxhole. Usually, they duck well behind the
baseline, counting on the distance to increase response time, using
the extra space as a cushion against Williams' force.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, just maybe, she'll miss. But these days, waiting out a
mistake by Williams is a high-risk gamble. So the spindly Meghann
Shaughnessy arrived at Arthur Ashe Stadium Friday night with a
different strategy. She came with an attack plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen matches of hers where the other person has been
completely intimidated,'' said the 21-year-old Shaughnessy, who is
ranked 48th. ``It's easy. She's much bigger, much stronger and hits
the ball harder than just about everyone. I know that when I'm
playing well, I can stay with players like her. It's just a matter
of really believing I can win and that I will win.''
</P>
<P>
   For an hour, that faith sustained Shaughnessy. For an hour, she
stood inside the baseline, came face to face with the
helicopter-like blades on Williams' swing and did not flinch.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the deflating part. When she had a chance to serve for
the first set, Shaughnessy could not find her nerve. Williams
seized upon Shaughnessy's lapse, watched her opponent's spirits
deflate, and went on to take her third-round match, 7-6 (3), 6-1,
at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   It was Williams' 22nd consecutive victory, but Shaughnessy's
defiant game plan unveiled a blueprint that might succeed against
the hottest player in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think she's beatable,'' Shaughnessy said. ``I
mean, in that first set there, if I had just served well, who knows
what can happen from there? Obviously, she's one of the best
players in the game, and she's going to be tough to beat, but I
definitely think it's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaughnessy had proof. When Williams launched a backhand across
the net, Shaughnessy took the ball early, converted the force into
her own power and crushed it into the corner pockets of the court.
When Williams inched toward the net with her intimidating wingspan,
Shaughnessy zipped the ball right at her body. Suddenly,
Shaughnessy was ahead, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   And Williams was in tangles. Under pressure she has rarely
experienced during her dominating streak, Williams' serve came
unraveled for a moment. She served six double faults in the first
set but managed to escape the tiebreaker after Shaughnessy sent
four straight ground strokes well off target. From there,
Shaughnessy began to retreat, and Williams took control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was a wake-up call,'' Williams said. ``She
did play well to get up, 3-love. It's not like I gave it to her.
She hit some nice shots. She had a nice strategy. You expect people
to come out and play well in a Grand Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   Some familiar names were on their games Friday. Almost a decade
ago, Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati arrived at the National
Tennis Center as two giggling teen-agers who were into stuffed
animals, mall trips and pink nail polish. But they quickly belied
their pastel-soft exteriors by unleashing ground strokes that were
as strong as paint thinner. The year was 1991. In an epic semifinal
played out at the U.S. Open, as one dared to top the other, Seles
emerged as the winner. But instead of serving as an appetizer to a
decadelong rivalry, the match stamped a date on the end of
innocence. By 1993, they had vanished. In the same year that Seles
was stabbed during a changeover at a match in Germany, Capriati
became a victim of self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they stand out as survivors. They have found their own
routes out of dark periods to come back to the tour, then endured
jabs about their fitness and doubts about their chances for
success. But younger and slimmer players have been ushered out of
the Open this week.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Seles and Capriati are on their way to a reunion at
the center of attention. Seles fought off Chanda Rubin in three
sets, and Capriati dismissed Adriana Gersi in 49 minutes, leaving
the two to meet in the Round of 16 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain players, it's strange how you play them always,'' said
Seles, who defeated Capriati last year at the Open. ``Certain
players, you never get to play them. Jennifer and I have played a
lot of matches, more so here.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy for Seles to make this reunion. On a day that
was drenched with humidity, she was a little woozy, but able to
withstand Rubin in the third set.
</P>
<P>
   As Day 5 unfolded in the drooping heat, there was Greg Rusedski,
laying on his stomach during a grueling five-set loss to the
resilient Cedric Pioline, grimacing during an oncourt massage; and
there was sixth-seeded Marat Safin, peeling off his shirt and
handing the drenched fabric to a fan after withstanding a scare
during his five-set victory against Gianluca Pozzi.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature also extended to Safin's temper. He bounced his
racket off the court, cried out to the crowd on misses and grumbled
about line calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happens once, OK,'' said Safin, referring to the
calls. ``Four times, you want to kill the guy. I mean you say to
him, `Pay a little bit attention to the bounces, please.'''
</P>
<P>
   Once Safin left the court, and before the rains came to wash out
the late match between Mark Philippoussis and Jan-Michael Gambill,
everyone's attention was on Williams. She was in trouble but did
not seem too concerned. Instead of feeling panic, she dipped into
her plentiful reserve of confidence. Just after her escape Friday
night, Williams saw no reason for her streak to end. Can it really
go on indefinitely?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure seems that way,'' Williams said. ``Who do I play next?
Magui Serna? I prefer to play a higher-ranked player, but you can't
pick the draw.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE CRISIS IN PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY
ILL 
</HEADLINE>
   By DUDLEY CLENDINEN   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Florida, where retirees have been flocking since the 1920s
and where 25 percent of the state's population is expected to be
over 65 by the year 2010, there are growing feelings of strain and
exhaustion among the managers, the nurses and nurses' aides who
care for the old and frail.
</P>
<P>
   The word most often heard in conversations with elder-care
professionals these days is ``crisis.'' With a population
calculated to be aging at a rate 20 years ahead of the nation as a
whole, the Sunshine State has become a harbinger for a nation
growing old and facing problems with long-term care for the aged.
</P>
<P>
   As the average life span lengthens, people seem healthier in old
age than ever before. The question is how to serve those who become
infirm or ill. In Florida and in the nation, most of that burden
falls, as it always has, on families, usually on a woman caring for
an older one. In Florida, a study four years ago found that almost
80 percent of the frail elderly were cared for at home.
African-American and Hispanic families are more likely to care for
their own, says Larry Polivka, director of the Center on Aging at
the University of South Florida, whereas more whites seek
professional help. But there is no way to know what quality of care
the people at home actually get, or what sacrifices their
care-givers have to make to give it.
</P>
<P>
   What is known, Polivka says, is that more than 88 percent of the
public money spent to support long-term care in Florida now goes to
nursing homes, where the remaining 20 percent of the frail elderly
reside. Nationally, in the last fiscal year about $39 billion in
public money for long-term care went to nursing homes, where the
average age of the residents is 85, where 42 percent are demented,
and 72 percent are women.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no one seems happy about the current state of affairs.
The federal government has found substantial evidence of fraud and
mismanagement in nursing home chains, as well as consistent
patterns of neglect and abuse. The nursing homes feel
over-regulated, under-compensated, unable to hire and keep
employees, and over-sued. The nursing home employees, who are
called on to do difficult work with compassion, feel underpaid and
unfairly maligned.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the residents increasingly sue on charges of
mistreatment. And a growing body of consumer advocates accuse the
state and federal governments of having no sensible policy of
long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in a word, a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Although four-fifths of Florida's nursing homes are in business
to make a profit, and tax dollars pay for 90 percent of their
charges, 23 percent of the beds are now managed by companies gone
bankrupt. In 11 other states, the percentage is even higher.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida, which allows residents to sue for violation of
their patient rights under state law _ and allows attorneys to
collect fees separate from the damages _ leads in another national
trend, the soaring rate of lawsuits against nursing homes. It began
11 years ago, when a Tampa attorney, Jim Wilkes, filed his first
suit on behalf of a resident. He won. He has since expanded to
seven other states, helped persuade Arkansas to pass a similar law,
put up billboards on highways to solicit cases, and says he
currently has 800 to 1,000 lawsuits in process, seeking a total of
about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He is out, Wilkes says, to destroy the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no good nursing homes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He is wrong. There are bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   There are also many good and caring homes, particularly the
nonprofit ones. But Wilkes and the other lawyers who have followed
his lead have had an effect. A study conducted this year for the
Florida Health Care Association of for-profit homes found that the
annual liability cost per occupied nursing home bed has now reached
$6,283 _ eight times the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Liability insurance premiums have ballooned. Mary Ellen Early,
director of the state's group of nonprofit homes, cited two cases:
a central Florida retirement community with its own nursing home,
whose premium has gone in a year from $33,000 to $545,000; and a
group of three homes, whose premium just jumped from $159,000 to
$1.7 million. Some insurers are canceling. A dozen or more nursing
homes in Florida now operate with no liability insurance at all.
</P>
<P>
   A 17-member task force headed by Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan, who
called the situation ``frightening,'' is expected to recommend some
changes to the state legislature by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   As Ruben King-Shaw, head of the state Health Care
Administration, has said, ``We are witnessing the disintegration of
the long-term-care system before our very eyes.''

EDITORIAL: EQUAL PAY ON THE TENNIS COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: The phrase `enfant terrible' that appear in bold is a foreign
expression that should appear in italics) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Sept. 2:
</P>
<P>
   It may not have Wimbledon's all-white dress code or perfectly
manicured grass, but the U.S. Open is the classiest of all Grand
Slam tennis tournaments. That is because the tournament, currently
being played in Queens, is the only one to allot equal prize money
to men and women.
</P>
<P>
   This gender equity is significant far beyond the tournament and
the game's professional circuit. Prizing the women's competition
equally sends a strong message to millions of aspiring young girls:
Your athletic pursuits are no less significant than those of your
male schoolmates.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the U.S. Open has been awarding equal prize money to
women for more than 25 years. But this can no longer be considered
a form of social engineering, or paternalistic altruism. The fact
is, the tournament's female players have become a stronger draw.
For three straight years the women's championship match has
garnered higher TV ratings than the men's. The men's game has been
in a bit of a slump of late, while fans are engrossed by the
intense rivalries and fine playing of Martina Hingis, the Williams
sisters, Lindsay Davenport, Mary Pierce, Monica Seles and others.
</P>
<P>
   John McEnroe, the game's enduring  &UR; enfant terrible &LR; ,
acknowledged women's enhanced marketing muscle when he quipped to
The New Yorker last month that the men may eventually have to sue
for equal pay. We hope it never comes to that. That would send the
wrong message to millions of aspiring young boys.

EDITORIAL: CHENEY ON DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Sept. 2:
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney turned up the heat on defense Wednesday with his
charge that the Clinton administration had run down the military,
leaving it with aging equipment, overextended forces and declining
readiness. Those are stinging accusations coming from the man who
ran the Pentagon during the Persian Gulf War. But on close
examination, many of Cheney's points seem misleading or
exaggerated. America's military forces are the world's strongest
and best prepared. To stay that way they must continue adapting to
the post-Cold War world, not return to the doctrines and
assumptions of a decade or more ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney notes, correctly, that defense spending has fallen to
just under 3 percent of national output, the lowest since Pearl
Harbor. But in the current booming economy, share of output is less
reliable than it used to be as a measure of military strength. Much
of the percentage decline Cheney points to is accounted for by
America's remarkable economic growth over the past decade, not
miserliness in defense spending. Adjusted for inflation, the United
States still spends about 95 percent as much for defense as it did
during the Cold War, though it now faces sharply reduced threats.
</P>
<P>
   When Cheney talks about overcommitment of American forces, he is
referring to United States participation in peacekeeping and
peace-enforcement missions, like the NATO-led operations in Bosnia
and Kosovo. Although the Bush campaign says it would now consider
scaling back American military forces' participation in the
Balkans, the Clinton administration cannot be seriously faulted for
joining its main allies in these life-saving interventions.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeeping is also part of the running debate about readiness.
Many of the statistical measures that are currently used to
evaluate readiness look at factors like recent combat experience or
training exercises. By those criteria, troops on duty in the
Balkans separating militias or helping to rebuild infrastructure
are eroding their readiness because they are neither fighting nor
conducting exercises. Even so, they are acquiring skills that will
be crucial for future missions. American forces need to be
battle-ready, rested and properly equipped. But there is no clear
agreement today on how combat readiness should be measured and no
consensus that U.S. troops are dangerously unready for action.
</P>
<P>
   America's current aircraft, ships and weapons decisively
outperform those of any other country, and many are scheduled for
replacement with expensive successors for which there is not yet a
visible need. Given this margin of safety, Cheney is right to
suggest diverting a greater share of the procurement budget to
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney comes closer to the mark when he asserts that the
Pentagon is straining to meet its own declared standard of being
prepared for two simultaneous regional conflicts, on the scale of
the Korean and Persian Gulf wars. But that standard is itself
dangerously outdated, putting too much emphasis on heavy mechanized
army divisions at the expense of the more mobile forces needed for
responding to sudden emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Defense policy ought to be part of the campaign debate, and
Cheney, as a former defense secretary, is well qualified to discuss
it. But he needs to do so with more precision and clarity than he
managed this week.
</P>
<P>
   On another defense matter that has emerged as a campaign issue,
President Clinton made the right call Friday when he decided to
leave it to the next president to decide whether and when to
construct a national missile defense. Vice President Al Gore sees a
strong case for building a limited missile defense and hopes he can
persuade Russia to accept it within the framework of existing arms
control treaties. Gov. George W. Bush wants to consider more robust
defensive technologies and hopes to deploy an effective missile
shield quickly. The president's decision to delay gives them a
chance to proceed more carefully in choosing the right system and
easing the concerns of Russia, China and America's skeptical NATO
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting makes sense because the missile defense technology
America has been testing remains unproven and because more time is
needed to find ways of constructing missile defenses without
overturning the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Russia.
Clinton also rightly deferred plans to award the initial
construction contracts for radars in Alaska. Starting work on those
radars could have forced Washington to give Moscow the required six
months' notice of withdrawal from the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's recent tests of the prototype interceptor missile
have been plagued with failures, and testing the system against
realistic decoys still lies ahead. Clinton serves America wisely by
leaving more time for diplomacy and testing.

DODGERS ADD A TOP ARM FROM MINORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Luke Prokopec might be given some pointers on
trimming his fingernails, but the Los Angeles Dodgers are hoping
they don't have to teach him much else.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed pitcher was one of four players the Dodgers
added when rosters were expanded Friday. His contract was purchased
from Double-A San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   While with the Missions, Prokopec had 124 strikeouts and just 23
walks in 128 innings. He was also the starting pitcher for the
Texas League all-star game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely among the top one or two pitching prospects
we've got in the system,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``I'd definitely like to get him in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The only setback could be a torn fingernail suffered while
throwing a slider in his last start.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 101 of pitching,'' Johnson said. ``You trim your
fingernails so they don't get caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson intends to use Prokopec out of the bullpen, but wouldn't
rule out eventually giving the 22-year-old a chance as a starter.
He compares Prokopec's opportunity to establish himself to the one
Eric Gagne had last year, when Gagne became the favorite to earn a
spot in the starting rotation heading into spring training this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty big jump,'' Johnson said. ``I'd like to get him
comfortable get him some games in first.''
</P>
<P>
   Prokopec, a native of Australia, has been in the Dodgers
organization since 1994, but wasn't converted to a pitcher until
midway through the 1997 season. A year later, the former outfielder
was named the Dodgers Minor League Pitcher of the Year. He was
twice named the organization's Minor League Pitcher of the Month
this season, in which he is 7-3 with a 2.45 ERA in 22 starts.
</P>
<P>
   More moves: Chris Donnels, Onanan Masaoka and Paul LoDuca were
also added to the Dodgers' roster Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Donnels had been on the disabled list with a sore right shoulder
since Aug. 2. He began a rehabilitation assignment at Triple-A
Albuquerque on Aug. 12 and hit .278 with a home run and four RBI
during the 18-game stint.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka and LoDuca were both recalled from Albuquerque and have
previous experience with the Dodgers this year.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Prokopec on the 40-man roster, infielder Mike
Metcalfe's contract was outrighted to Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Flu bug bites again: Todd Hundley did not start Friday after
being weakened by a virus Thursday. Hundley went 0 for 4 in
Thursday's loss at Milwaukee and complained about the illness
during the game, according to Johnson, who added the catcher was
dehydrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the end of the game he had the trainer make the hot tub
a cold tub,'' Johnson said. ``He was really beat up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley said he was a lot better Friday, but Johnson wanted to
give him more time to rest, giving Chad Kreuter the start instead.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Gary Sheffield's uniform was baggy on him, since
he'd lost about 10 pounds, but he was back in the lineup for the
first time since he became ill Aug. 22. The Dodgers were 8-3 during
Sheffield's absence. ... Sheffield will be the host of ``This Week
in Baseball'' before today's Fox Game of the Week. ... The Dodgers
play 18 of their next 24 games at home and out of the final 27,
have only six outside of California.

(EDS NOTE: The complete text of President Clinton's speech is
available from The New York Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com) By
ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Friday that he did not
believe that the technology was ready yet for an effective national
defense system, and passed the decision on moving ahead with the
politically charged and diplomatically delicate project to his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted that the threat of future missile attacks from
states like Iraq or North Korea ``is real and growing'' and that
the United States had to search for new defenses. But after two
failed tests and strong resistance from Russia, China and America's
closest allies in Europe, the president announced that he would not
authorize even initial construction on the missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made progress, but we should not move forward until we
have absolute confidence the system will work,'' he said,
announcing one of his most important foreign policy decisions in a
speech at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Clinton laid out an articulate case, both in
politics and substance, for why it was dangerous to plunge headlong
into a $60 billion program that would violate a landmark arms
control treaty with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``A national missile defense, if deployed, should be part of a
larger strategy to preserve and enhance the peace, strength and
security we now enjoy, and to build an even safer world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision comes just before the Labor Day holiday
weekend, while Congress is still in summer recess, and just days
before he is to meet world leaders in New York at the United
Nations. He has taken off the table an issue that otherwise might
have soured his scheduled meetings with other leaders, including
President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is also likely to open up much broader debate on
the issue between the presidential contenders, who have adopted
starkly different approaches toward missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, has
largely embraced the administration's stand of building a limited
land-based system without withdrawing from the Antiballistic
Missile Treaty of 1972. The Republican nominee, Gov. George W.
Bush, favors a broader system that could include sea- and
space-based arms.
</P>
<P>
   On May 23, Bush signaled his support for Clinton's leaving the
decision to the next administration rather than committing the
country to a course based on incomplete information, saying, ``No
decision would be better than a flawed agreement that ties the
hands of the next president and prevents America from defending
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Bush adopted a much sharper tone, criticizing the
administration's handling of the missile defense program. ``I
welcome the opportunity to act where they have failed to lead by
developing and deploying effective missiles to protect all 50
states and our friends and allies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Gore said he supported Clinton's decision, one
that aides said he had discussed with the president, and implicitly
criticized Bush's plan, which would require the United States to
withdraw from the ABM treaty. The accord bars Washington and Moscow
from building national missile defenses, unless Moscow agrees to
changes, which so far it has steadfastly refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, I would oppose the kinds of missile defense
systems that would unnecessarily upset strategic stability and
threaten to open the gates for a renewed arms race with Russia and
a new arms race with China,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, leaders throughout Europe, who had been caught
between America's ambitions for missile defenses and the strong
opposition from Russia and China, applauded Clinton's decision,
though they seemed mostly relieved. And Russian officials expressed
satisfaction that their diplomatic campaign, mainly by Putin, to
galvanize opposition against the American program had apparently
helped persuade Clinton to abandon it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Pentagon would continue develop and test the
system, noting that only three of the 19 flight tests have been
conducted so far.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate upshot of Clinton's decision is that the
Pentagon's 2005 target date for having an initial, limited means of
defending all 50 states against attack by a small number of
ballistic missiles has been scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials have warned that North Korea could have
the ca- pability to hit the United States with nuclear or
chemical-tipped ballistic missiles by that date.
</P>
<P>
   To stick to that ambitious schedule, Clinton would have had to
authorize the Pentagon by December to award contracts for initial
construction on Shemya Island in Alaska of a powerful new radar
that would provide the missile-tracking ability needed for an
effective missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   But an independent panel led by a retired Air Force general,
Larry D. Welch, determined earlier this year that because of the
program's enormous technical complexity and the likelihood of
technical glitches and other delays, a deployment date of 2006 or
2007 was more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seized on that analysis to assert that his decision
``will not have a significant impact on the date the overall system
could be deployed in the next administration if the next president
decides to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, Clinton's decision probably means that work on
the Shemya radar cannot begin before 2002, which insures that a
national missile defense could not be completed before 2006 at the
earliest. The decision gives the next president leeway to
restructure the program or reorder its priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen, the lone Republican in
Clinton's Cabinet, was the administration's most forceful advocate
of fielding national missile defenses as soon as possible. Cohen
recommended to Clinton last week and in a meeting at the White
House on Tuesday that he go ahead with that initial construction.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse, three-paragraph statement, Cohen said, ``I have
noted on many occasions that several emerging threats warrant the
deployment of an effective missile defense program as soon as
technologically feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had previously said the final decision
to field a missile defense system would rest with Clinton's
successor.
</P>
<P>
   But even the preliminary step of breaking ground and pouring a
concrete foundation at the Alaska site could have been interpreted
as a violation of the ABM treaty, according to some legal analyses
prepared by administration lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Russia has refused to permit the United States to change the
treaty, a cornerstone of cold war-era arms control policy, and
Clinton was loath to have his name in the history books as the
president who withdrew the United States from the landmark accord.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the diplomatic repercussions, Clinton's national
security adviser, Sandy Berger, as well as Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and her deputy, Strobe Talbott, the chief
American negotiator with Russia, opposed permitting the initial
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Berger telephoned several Congressional leaders late Thursday to
alert them to Clinton's decision. Albright also called several
world leaders and lawmakers Friday, and Clinton informed President
Jacques Chirac of France.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Democrats, scores of whom had urged Clinton to
defer all decisions on the system, applauded the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's decision gives us time to perfect our
political approach to the ballistic missile threat, as well as our
technology,'' said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the
ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican reaction was mixed, with some of the program's
biggest backers decrying another delay. ``Because of the
president's misguided decision, our children will remain completely
unprotected against the weapon of choice for rogue nations and
terrorist groups _ the missile,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Penn.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, said, ``This is
yet another example of the Clinton-Gore administration's legacy of
missed opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   But two prominent Republican members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Gordon H. Smith of Oregon and Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska, praised Clinton's choice. ``The president made the right
decision today,'' Hagel said. ``There will be dangerous
consequences for America and the world if we rush to meet arbitrary
decision deadlines.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton said American security was based on the
three pillars of diplomacy, deterrence and defense. ``No one
suggests that NMD would ever substitute for diplomacy or for
deterrence,'' Clinton said, using the abbreviation for national
missile defense. ``But such a system, if it worked properly, could
give us an extra dimension of insurance in a world where
proliferation has complicated the task of preserving the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and his top advisers established four criteria to
judge whether to move the system ahead: threat, cost, technology
and impact on American security, including arms control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a balancing act that has to be taken,'' Berger told
reporters after Clinton's speech. ``The way I ask the question is,
will we be more secure or less secure?''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials did not quarrel about the reality of
the threat, even though Clinton noted that North Korea had
refrained from testing new, long-range missiles. And while the cost
of the system's initial phase, consisting of 100 missile
interceptors and a system of early-warning radars, had increased by
about $4 billion in recent months to a total of $25 billion,
growing federal budget surpluses had eased concern about that.
</P>
<P>
   But the system had run into a number of technical problems.
After a largely successful first test last fall, the next two tests
failed, including the latest on July 7. Pentagon officials say the
next test has been postponed from October or Novem- ber, to next
January.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that crucial elements of the program, like the
booster rocket for the missile interceptor, were behind schedule
and had yet to be tested. Experts still had concerns whether the
interceptors could adequately distinguish enemy warheads from
decoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply cannot conclude, with the information that is
available to us today, that we have enough confidence in the
technology and operational effectiveness of this entire system to
move ahead with deployment,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, China, Russia and European allies all voiced fears that
even beginning the initial construction could violate the ABM
treaty and trigger a new arms race, especially in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Given the potential diplomatic consequences, administration
officials said, there was little reason to push ahead with even the
preliminary construction when chances that an effective system
could be up and working by 2005 were slim.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several months, the domestic politics changed as
well. With Republicans like Hagel and Smith, among others, calling
for Clinton to defer, Gore was shielded to some extent from any
political fallout if the administration decided to leave the
deployment decisions to the next president.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has always been ambivalent about a
limited missile defense system, arguing for years that the threat
did not warrant spending billions of dollars on unproven
technology, which had its origins in the vaunted Star Wars proposal
of the Reagan years.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House did an abrupt about-face in mid-1998 after
two things happened. First, a bipartisan commission headed by
Donald H. Rumsfeld, a Republican and former defense secretary,
warned that within five years North Korea and Iran could
conceivably reach the United States with long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Then, six weeks later, as if on cue, North Korea took American
intelligence experts by surprise by testing a three-stage missile
with perhaps enough range to hit North America.
</P>
<P>
   By early last year, the White House was pledging its conditional
support and $10.5 billion over six years to a limited system. Last
summer, Clinton signed into law the National Missile Defense Act,
which requires the United States to field a national defense
against a limited strike when technologically feasible. An original
sponsor of the legislation was Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, a
Connecticut Democrat who is now Gore's running mate.

RUSSIANS SEE CLINTON'S DECISION AS DIPLOMATIC VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS lede to clarify)  
(With MISSILE-DEFENSE and related stories) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As European leaders Friday applauded President
Clinton's decision to defer building a missile defense shield over
the Unit- ed States, Russian officials ex- pressed satisfaction
that their diplo- matic campaign to galvanize opposi- tion against
the U.S. program had apparently helped persuade Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A former Russian ambassador to the United States, Vladimir P.
Lukin, who serves as deputy speaker of Parliament here, called
Clinton's decision predictable and rational and said that Russian
President Vladimir Putin had scored a temporary diplomatic victory.
He cautioned, however, that the contentious international issue
would return early next year.
</P>
<P>
   European officials, caught between America's ambitions for
missile defenses and the strident opposition from Russia and China,
seemed mostly relieved. Across the continent, political leaders
said Clinton's decision removed the issue from American
presidential politics and created needed time for increasingly
complex consultations and debate over missile threats and how to
cope with them.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac, one of the most pointed critics
of the American plan, was the only leader to issue a personal
statement Friday night. He said he had been informed of Clinton's
decision by letter Friday, which he said he received with ``great
interest'' given France's view that the project ``risks undermining
the strategic equilibrium and a return to the nuclear arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   Great Britain and Germany praised Clinton's decision. A
spokesman in Berlin, Bela Anda, said the government of Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder had ``understanding and respect'' for the ``wise
decision,'' adding that Germany's ``reservations about this project
are well known.'' Karsten D. Voigt, who coordinates German-American
affairs in the foreign ministry, said the decision was welcome
because it gave more time for consultations inside the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Foreign Minister Robin Cook said Clinton had ``taken
careful account of the views'' of American ``allies and other
international partners'' in pulling up short on the deployment of
missile defenses, which would violate the Antiballistic Missile
Treaty of 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to continuing dialogue on this subject with
the current'' administration in Washington ``and, in due course,
with its successor, and with our NATO allies and others,'' Cook
said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, the leader who worked hardest this year at undermining
American justification for going ahead with missile defenses, was
conspicuously silent Friday night in the face of what was seen
here, for now, as a diplomatic victory of sorts. Still, Clinton's
decision only puts off until some time next year the potential
confrontation between Moscow and Washington over the future of
long-standing arms control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader leaves Moscow this weekend for visits to
Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has said it will not agree to changes in the 1972 treaty,
and has warned that an American decision to break the treaty would
render all arms control agreements signed between Washington and
Moscow during three decades null and void.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Putin undertook an energetic diplomatic
campaign in Europe and Asia against the American plan to erect a
missile shield over the United States, one that would leave Europe
outside the defensive umbrella and that would perhaps incite China
to build up its nuclear arsenal further, thus triggering further
escalation in the arms race in South Asia between India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader even flew to the North Korean capital,
Pyongyang, and secured an as yet unelaborated promise from Kim Jong
Il, the country's reclusive leader, to give up North Korea's
long-range missile program in return for Western space-launch
assistance for North Korean satellites.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting this proposal to the large industrial nations at a
July summit meeting in Okinawa, Putin sought to refute the American
assertion that North Korea's long-range missile program posed such
an acute threat to the United States that early deployment of
missile defenses was warranted. Moreover, a budding rapprochement
between North and South Korea, whose leaders met this summer for
the first time since the Korean War, further deflated any sense of
imminent danger from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Lukin, the former Russian ambassador to the United States, said
he believed Clinton made his decision based exclusively on domestic
political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Any decision by Clinton would have been reassessed as soon as a
new administration took over anyway, Lukin said, and Clinton did
not want to do anything that would be detrimental to the Democratic
Party, like making compromises with Moscow that would subject Vice
President Al Gore to political attacks during the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate, George W. Bush, has
criticized the Clinton-Gore administration for failing to
strengthen America's defenses, and has said that if he is elected
president, he will proceed with a missile defense system at the
earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was able to capitalize on serious concerns in Europe and
Asia that the United States was creating ``an unequal security
system'' between itself, its NATO allies and other major powers
like Russia and China, Lukin observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has unified everyone against the United States, including
your allies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lukin added that it would be ``unwise for Putin to
celebrate any victory'' over Friday's decision because ``it is only
temporary and is connected with internal politics in the United
States.'' As of January 2001, he said, a new American president
will face substantial political pressure to deploy a missile
defense system, if further testing proves the system viable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The timing of Clinton's announcement may spare him some
criticism from world leaders assembling at the United Nations next
week for a global summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   China's president, Jiang Zemin, was said to be preparing to
express Beijing's opposition to the American missile defense plan
during a speech to the leaders, according to a senior diplomat in
the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
   Certain countries are still seeking so-called absolute security
for themselves and are speeding up the development and deployment
of advanced anti-missile systems, a senior Chinese diplomat told
reporters in Beijing on Thursday. Jiang had been expected to assert
that American missile defenses would seriously undermine the
positive trend in international disarmament efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The American defense system poses particularly difficult
decisions for European countries like Great Britain and Denmark,
whose territories might be needed to enhance American radar
capabilities to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles from states
like North Korea, Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a House of Commons foreign affairs committee urged
the government to encourage Washington to address the nuclear
threat from rogue states by means other than the proposed missile
shield, which would not be able to stop a nuclear, chemical or
biological weapon delivered in a suitcase, or on a ship, or other
than by missile. The committee said it was not convinced the plan
represented an appropriate response to potential threats.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on Clinton's announcement, Menzies Campbell, a
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party in Great Britain, said,
``The British government must seize the opportunity provided by
President Clinton's decision to make a robust case against
deployment.''

 LIEBERMAN SHOWS THE GIFT OF SCHMOOZE  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leticia Castro wasn't exactly thrilled at first when Joe
Lieberman slid into the Naugahyde booth with her at Spires Coffee
Shop in Anaheim this week. She was just having breakfast, and there
he was: not just a regular guy, but a guy who wants to be vice
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Leticia is 18, has never cast a vote in a presidential race, and
she looked a little nervous. There were lots of cameras and
reporters around.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman, Al Gore's running mate, was clutching a mug of
coffee. And with a smile, he gently started asking questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there anything that you want to say to me about the
campaign?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The scene _ and the question _ were repeated over and over again
this week as the Connecticut senator made his way around
California.
</P>
<P>
   Voters here are mostly used to seeing their politicians from a
distance _ on television, in advertising, and usually bashing each
other over the head.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman showed his talent for what's called ``retail''
politics _ a detail that was nearly lost amid the controversy that
erupted a few days ago over his views on the importance of religion
in American life.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Gore, who sometimes sounds like a college professor
lecturing his students, Lieberman is more like the new neighbor who
wants to get to know the folks next door.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does he appear to be genuine in his interest in people,
but Lieberman also seems to have that rare gift of getting
strangers to open up, even under the most trying circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's conversation with Leticia, the reluctant young
day-care worker, was a good example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything OK?'' the Democratic candidate started out.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the teenager's tense expression loosened.
Leticia started talking to the senator, about her work, her pay,
her family and her mom, an immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman nodded. His grandparents were immigrants, too, he
said. Then he asked her advice on the campaign ahead.
</P>
<P>
   He sidled up to a suspicious-looking Margorie Minnix, 92, of
Garden Grove, who was finishing up a plate of bacon and eggs with
her daughter Jeneal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things going all right?'' Lieberman ventured.
</P>
<P>
   A few sips of coffee later, he was getting the details about the
kids, the grandkids and the eight great-grandkids.
</P>
<P>
   The senator shook hands with a young woman with a toddler. With
his prompting, she shyly began talking about her life as a ``stay
at home'' mom. ``You're smart to stay home,'' he said in the end.
``These are important years.''
</P>
<P>
   He slid in next to Marv Martinson, who was reading the paper
with his wife, Norma. ``We've seen you on TV,'' Norma said. Soon,
the three were talking about life, family, the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't complain too much,'' Norma said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know. Things are pretty good,'' said Lieberman with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   At the San Diego Children's Hospital, the senator sat on a kids'
colored picnic table while parents in crisis or with critically ill
children told him their stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jeff got hurt, it was devastating,'' said a tearful
Sherri Buys as she related the trauma caused by her construction
worker husband's hernia, in response to the senator's questions.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Lieberman used humor to lighten up the sadness and
work the crowd. Motioning to a sick child who fell asleep while he
talked, Lieberman joked, ``I've known of senators and vice
presidents to fall asleep in the afternoon.'' Then he added
mischievously, ``Not this vice president!''
</P>
<P>
   The result: Even some who didn't necessarily agree with him _
Leticia Castro recalled she ``wasn't impressed'' before he sat in
that diner with her _ said they would now take a second look.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a back room of the hospital late in the afternoon,
Lieberman shook his head in wonder when asked about this love of
schmooze.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, he said, his ``schtick'' was to hit 100 diners
in his last race, to ``talk to real people, see what's on their
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it, because the campaign becomes real,'' he said. ``I
have found over the years ... that people are remarkably willing to
share their stories. It reminds you why you're in government.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Gore chose him to be his running mate three weeks ago,
Lieberman said, he sometimes marvels at all the hoopla _ his new
place in the spotlight, the symbolism, the big stage. But he also
understands that even a national campaign is also about sharing a
cup of coffee, a conversation in a diner, a piece of personal
history, with plain folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It touches me. There are times when, just by fate, you end up
being larger than yourself. I mean, I'm &UR; me. &LR;  But I know that now,
thanks to Al Gore ... I have a larger role to play,'' he said.
``I'm working hard to make it come out right.''

GOP STARTING BUSH TV ADS IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican Party officials plan to roll out two television ads
to ``introduce'' Texas Gov. George W. Bush to California next week,
part of a statewide media effort that they promised &LR;  will continue
through the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to reach Californians in each and every one of the
state's media markets,'' said State Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho
Cucamonga, the finance chair for the state GOP and a Bush backer
who added the GOP will spend $500,000 the first week of the TV
campaign. ``This is just the first in a long series of ads designed
to continue to introduce Gov. Bush to the people of California.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials wouldn't reveal the total cost of the ad
campaign, or its duration, but said the TV effort beginning
Thursday will be paid for by both the California Republican Party
and the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Parsky, who chairs Bush's state campaign, called it ``a
significant buy,'' though in the state's most expensive media
markets, Los Angeles and San Francisco, ``we may do cable
(television).''
</P>
<P>
   ``But our plan is to go up, and stay (on the air)'' through
November 7, election day, he said. ``We're here to compete to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of a California TV campaign comes the week of
Labor Day _ the traditional kickoff of the crucial final phase of
the presidential campaign _ and just before the Texas governor
plans a three-day trip to California from Sept. 12-14.
</P>
<P>
   But it also coincides with a rocky period for Bush's
presidential effort. A recent Field Poll showed Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore ahead by 13 percentage points in
California _ though Republicans Friday touted a Zogby poll that put
the spread at just 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has had other troubles as well: The candidate has been
distracted from his education message in past weeks, as he appeared
to go on the defensive on other key issues. In addition, increasing
media focus has been on his campaign's continued reluctance to sign
on to a series of nationally televised debates to which Gore has
already agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Political insiders say those are some reasons why, even before
Labor Day, Bush's campaign _ which recently unveiled a new motto
called ``Change the Tone'' _ chose this week to launch in
battleground Midwestern states a negative ad which  &LR; that
sarcastically questions Gore's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in Louisiana Friday, stood by the ad, saying it was a fair
look at Gore's record and defended the spot's tone as merely
``tongue-in-cheekish.''
</P>
<P>
   But in California, the two ads chosen to air will deal with more
positive subjects _ education and social security.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two areas that Gov. Bush has demonstrated real
leadership in,'' said Parsky, ``and two areas that people, in the
past, may have thought Republicans didn't (address).''
</P>
<P>
   In the education spot called ``Expect More,'' which also ran in
California during the primary season, Bush is shown in classroom
settings, extolling his view that ``no child should be left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Social Security spot called ``This Generation,'' Bush
vows that ``promises will be honored'' when it comes to the
program. The ad is a direct response to Gore, who has dismissed
Bush's tax plan as a ``risky'' scheme which will put Social
Security at risk.

CITING HEALTH OF DAUGHTER, CLINTONS CUT VISIT SHORT
</HEADLINE>
  By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKANEATELES, N.Y. _ The president and Hillary Rodham Clinton
arrived here Friday afternoon for what was supposed to be a weekend
of fund-raising, campaigning and relaxing in the Finger Lakes. But
the White House announced that the Clintons would return to
Washington on Saturday night, a day earlier than planned, to care
for their daughter, Chelsea, who was said to be suffering from a
cold.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' decision to scale back their Labor Day weekend
plans came as The Associated Press reported that the builder who
lent them a lakefront vacation house this year and last year was
the subject of a 10-month-old warrant by the New York State Tax
Department seeking $938,357 in taxes, penalties and interest in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the tax problems
of Thomas B. McDonald, the Clintons' weekend host, played no role
in their decision. He said the White House knew of McDonald's tax
liability when the Clintons used his house last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is someone they like very much, and he is working to
resolve the issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that Chelsea Clinton, who had just finished trips
to Africa and Colombia, was suffering from fatigue and a bad cold,
and that the Clintons wanted to spend as much of the holiday
weekend with her as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Although White House and Clinton campaign aides insisted that
the change in plans had nothing to do with McDonald, the Associated
Press report detracted from what was likely to be the easiest
weekend the first lady would enjoy between now and Election Day.
With evident glee, aides to Clinton's opponent in the U.S. Senate
race, Rick Lazio, moved to draw attention to the report almost the
moment it moved on the wires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess this is what Hillary Clinton means when she says she
supports targeted tax cuts for the middle class,'' said Michael
Marr, a spokesman for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign responded by citing a news report of an
instance in which a builder who contributed $5,000 to Lazio's
campaign was in tax arrears. ``Rick Lazio should clean up his own
house before throwing some more mud at Hillary Clinton,'' said
Cathie Levine, a campaign spokeswoman. ``It seems that Mr. Lazio
will do anything to avoid talking about the issues in this race.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House sent out an e-mail message on Thursday night
announcing the Clintons' change of plans. The AP report came out
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant against McDonald was for 1997 taxes. It was filed on
Nov. 1, 1999, according to Marc Carey, a spokesman for the tax
department. McDonald could not be reached by telephone at his home
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Paul M. Predmore, said McDonald was trying to work
out a plan to pay the back taxes. He said McDonald also owed
federal taxes, but he would not say how much.
</P>
<P>
   Predmore attributed McDonald's debt to a failed real estate
investment. He said 1997 was the only year for which McDonald owed
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' change in plans appeared to cut more into time set
aside for relaxing than politicking.
</P>
<P>
   The president and the first lady went to a fund-raiser this
evening _ a ``Dinosaur Barbecue'' _ with a menu that included
pulled pork, spare ribs and chicken. Aides said the event would
raise as much as $150,000 for Clinton's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raiser, the president emphasized one of his wife's
main campaign themes as he credited her for playing a
``substantive, positive role in the work we have done over these
past eight years.'' And he criticized Republicans for their attacks
on his wife. ``Their campaign is basically trying to do reverse
plastic surgery on her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the president spoke whimsically about his own years in
office as he noted that he was going to be followed at the
microphone by a magician. ``I want to see this,'' he said, ``I've
spent eight years trying to be one.''
</P>
<P>
   A second fund-raiser is set for Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a a row, the Clintons also planned to
visit the New York State Fair. Lazio attended earlier this week.

SEDER HOPING TO EXTEND COWBOYS' ROOKIE SUCCESS AT KICKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Inside his head, Cowboys rookie kicker Tim Seder
is treating his first game no differently than when he got ready to
play Mercyhurst, Michigan Tech or even Saginaw Valley State.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it's the Philadelphia Eagles at Texas Stadium on
Sunday (3:05 p.m. kickoff) in the 2000 season opener and the
Cowboys' 81st consecutive home sellout, well, none of this is
connected to the leg bone, Seder figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to get started. I'm approaching it the same way I
approach any other game,'' said the 25-year-old former high school
health/physical-education teacher who made the Cowboys as a rookie
free agent, three years removed from NCAA Division II Ashland
University.
</P>
<P>
   Seder (5-foot-9, 180 pounds, size 8 kicking shoe) hasn't kicked
in a game that counted since 1997, although he was 7-for-9 in
field-goal attempts this preseason to beat out four other kickers
who began in the off-season program together. Seder's only misses
were from 58 and 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   History shows that the Cowboys are excellent in season openers
(30-9-1) and very good in season openers since Jerry Jones has been
the owner (8-3). They are perfect (4-0) in season openers since
Jones has been the owner and the team has carried a rookie or
first-year kicker.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' philosophy toward the kicking game under Jones has
been to maintain a low overhead and let 12th-year kickers coach
Steve Hoffman develop young kickers and punters onto the final
roster.
</P>
<P>
   But this will be the first time Hoffman and the Cowboys have
gone into a season with a rookie kicker (Seder), a rookie punter
(Micah Knorr) and a rookie holder (Knorr).
</P>
<P>
   When asked if a rookie kicker makes him nervous, Hoffman
replied, ``I'm nervous with any kicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman knows that the key, of course, will be Seder's nerves.
So far, Hoffman likes what he has seen: powerful leg,
``aerobic-like'' movement behind the ball, and a small foot that
allows Seder to punch the ball rather than swipe at it.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Cowboys' job became his, Seder had to resign from
Lucas High School in Mansfield, Ohio, where he spent two years
after college as a multi-sport coach, including offensive
coordinator/line coach for the varsity football team.
</P>
<P>
   After Seder telephoned his former players last week to wish them
well, Lucas opened with a 57-0 victory against Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   Seder's wife, Melissa, arrived here today from their home in
Ashland, Ohio, where she teaches at a nearby high school. She will
be joined at Sunday's game by her parents and Tim's parents.
</P>
<P>
   That's the extent of the Seder caravan from Ashland, Ohio, Seder
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, somebody has to stay home and keep the town running.
\Nsubheds:Campo eager for first game A 29-year, 13-coaching stop
wait ends Sunday for Dave Campo when he takes the field against
Eagles as Cowboys head coach.
</P>
<P>
   A career assistant, Campo will be leading a team for the first
time on any level.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of his teammates from Central Connecticut State as well
as his six children will be at the game. Campo said he's had
trouble sleeping this week because his adrenaline is already
flowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about it,'' Campo said. ``It's something I've
worked a long time for. But it's not really about me. It's about
the players. They've got to play at this point. \Nname:_ Clarence
E. Hill Jr. \Nsubheds:Sparks and Larrimore Dave Campo said the
decision on who starts at left cornerback between rookie Kareem
Larrimore and newly signed veteran Phillippi Sparks will be made at
game time.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks is expected eventually to become the starter there. What
has made the decision questionable for Sunday is Sparks' poor
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, who came out of retirement to sign with the Cowboys on
Monday, has looked better in practice each day. However, Campo said
there is no way Campo is ready to play 60 snaps tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is getting his legs back,'' Campo said. ``I don't know how
long he can go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys plan to use Sparks, whose expertise they covet.
Campo also reiterated that Larrimore will see a lot of time against
the Eagles. \Nname:_ Clarence E. Hill Jr. \Nsubheds:Briefly The
Cowboys put cornerbacks Charlie Williams and Dwayne Goodrich,
offensive guard Al Jackson and defensive tackle Michael Myers on
the inactive list for Sunday's game. Four more players will be
named inactive Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Jason Tucker will be the main kickoff returner.
Receiver Wane McGarity is set to be the punt returner, although
Joey Galloway will return punts in some situations. \Nname:_
Clarence E. Hill Jr.
\Npcredit:Wichita Falls Times Record News With kicker Tim Seder and
punter Micah Knorr, who also serves as the holder on field-goal and
extra-point attempts, the Cowboys are going into a season with a
rookie kicker, punter and holder for the first time.
\Nsubheds:Kicking the youthful habit \Nagatea:Tim Seder becomes the
fifth kicker with no NFL regular-season experience to start a
Cowboys' season since 1990. Here are the previous four along with
what they did: Year Player Season Opening game 1990 Ken Willis
18-for-25 (.720) 1-for-1 (17-yard FG) in 17-14 home victory against
San Diego. 1992 Lin Elliott 24-for-35 (.686) 0-for-1 (32-yard miss)
in 23-10 home victory against Washington. 1994 Chris Boniol
22-for-29 (.759) 4-for-4 (40, 31, 21, 32 FGs) in 26-9 victory at
Pittsburgh. 1997 Richie Cunningham 34-for-37 (.919) 3-for-3 (52,
24, 28 FGs) in 37-7 victory at Pittsburgh. \Nagated: Cunningham
technically was listed as a first-year player, not a rookie,
because he had been in an NFL training camp (Green Bay) prior to
'97. Note: The Cowboys over the past 10 seasons have won all four
season-openers they have played with a rookie or first-year kicker
on the team. These kickers have been 8-for-9 on field-goal attempts
in their collective NFL debuts.

U.N. PARLEY TO BRING TRAFFIC CRUSH, TIGHT SECURITY AND PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS streets in 4th graf)  
 By DEAN E. MURPHY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Forget, just for a moment, that some of the
weightiest world issues are up for discussion next week during the
Millennium Summit at the United Nations, the biggest gathering of
heads of state and government ``in human history,'' as the United
Nations says. Poverty. Global warming. AIDS. Illiteracy. Urban
decay.
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk New York weighty _ in-your-backyard weighty.
</P>
<P>
   Unspeakable traffic snarls and some 175 curb-skipping motorcades
around Kennedy International Airport in Queens and the United
Nations Plaza on the East Side. Several thousand U.S. Secret
Service agents elbowing their way through 36 hotels and countless
restaurants in pursuit of their 245 ``protectees,'' from President
Clinton to Prime Minister Ionatana Ionatana of Tuvalu.
</P>
<P>
   Police lookouts at major bridges and tunnels in Manhattan, 6,000
additional officers patrolling the streets and a knot of road
closings between 30th and 63rd Streets and between Franklin D.
Roosevelt Drive and Seventh Avenue. Ninety-one scheduled public
protests with a crush of demonstrators. Even mountains of garbage,
piled on barges destined for the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten
Island, left rotting upstream because of precautions against
terrorism on the East River.
</P>
<P>
   All of this will be dumped on a testy citizenry slogging back to
work after the Labor Day finale to a summer that mostly did not
happen, and on a city already besieged by the tennis crowds at the
U.S. Open in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me thank in advance the good people of New York, our
neighbors in New York, for their patience,'' said Louise Frechette,
the deputy secretary-general of the United Nations, the other day
in announcing the details of the three-day summit conference, which
begins on Wednesday. ``We know their patience will be tried in the
course of the summit conference week, but we would like to invite
them to be patient and to reassure them that this is really for a
good cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience is not a characteristic generally associated with New
Yorkers. Add an expected 159 world leaders and 86 first spouses to
the 7 million or so people here who already consider themselves
very important, and the United Nations is looking at a titanic
clash of egos and schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Frechette knows that. So does Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
most everyone else who works at the U.N. headquarters. (After all,
they live here as well, one official pointed out.) That is why New
Yorkers are witnessing what the United Nations calls another first
in human history: the world organization's effort to sell itself to
the city as a worthy neighbor through a $700,000 promotional
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 49 years since the 39-story Secretariat building on
First Avenue opened as the United Nations' official home, but it
seems it is never too late for an introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always cared, but this is part of the new U.N., trying
to be more inclusive and transparent and reaching out to
everyone,'' said Susan Markham, chief of promotion and planning for
the United Nations' department of public information. ``The public
relations campaign is trying to get across to people the importance
of this millennium meeting so that they won't feel so bad sitting
in traffic jams.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also the closest the United Nations will come to
apologizing for the world-class mess coming New York's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be pretty much a nightmare,'' Markham said. ``It is
hard getting around on a regular day, let alone when something like
this is happening. Saying, `Sorry you are in a traffic jam,'
doesn't really help very much. Hopefully, New Yorkers will realize
what is going on at the summit will affect their lives too.''
</P>
<P>
   In televised public service announcements, Harry Belafonte talks
about the serious tasks facing the U.N. gathering. Advertisements
in subway trains, on Metropolitan Transportation Authority maps and
at bus shelters pronounce, ``History will be made here.'' There
will even be a Batman-style beacon of light, flashing a
still-undisclosed message over the crush of drivers and pedestrians
near United Nations Plaza, to remind the vexed and vanquished that
good shall prevail (starting, presumably, in some meeting room on
the East River).
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is being donated by Brand Buzz, a division of Young
&AMP; Rubicam Inc. John Partilla, managing director of Brand Buzz, says
the United Nations has ``an overall positioning and identity''
problem in New York which is only going to get worse with the
anticipated fallout from the Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are quick to judge and say, `We are inconvenienced,'''
Partilla said. ``We need to remind people that they are not selling
shoes or soda pop over at the U.N. They are really working to solve
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Once that connection is made, he said, the strategy calls for
New Yorkers to spontaneously proclaim their affection for the
United Nations: Yes, there is some inconvenience, but I am proud to
be in this city, the imagined self pep talk goes, Partilla said.
Brand Buzz intentionally avoided direct references to traffic and
other problems in its promotional materials because that would
``just play up the negative,'' he said. (Yes, there is some
inconvenience, and curse this blasted place, is not the monologue
Partilla has in mind.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a little bit of faith that the world is not
all half empty out there,'' he said. ``But there is a leap there, I
admit.''
</P>
<P>
   The test may be in how difficult things really get next week.
New York is a place where the extraordinary can seem ordinary, but
this time, the authorities say, the disruption will really be one
of a kind. The upheaval is expected to begin Sunday, when the first
foreign dignitaries arrive; reach its worst stage on Thursday, when
the biggest U.N. meetings are held; and ease sometime next weekend
as everyone skips town.
</P>
<P>
   The three days of meetings are being described as a working
summit conference, not a celebration or commemoration. There will
be no formal banquets or ceremonial toasts; the only ``nod to
tradition,'' Frechette said, will be a group photograph. The heart
of the summit meeting will be a series of small, informal
round-table discussions, which are intended to encourage the
world's leaders to speak frankly about many problems. At the end,
they are expected to adopt a declaration renewing their moral and
political commitment to everything from preventing conflicts to
expanding the Internet in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At its simplest, the problem can be explained with arithmetic:
the larger the number of heads of state and government in
attendance, the larger the number of possible threats. The larger
the number of possible threats, the larger the number of security
people. The larger the number of security people, the larger . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one thing when the president comes into town and you
have one motorcade,'' said Lt. Stephen Biegel, a spokesman for the
New York Police Department, which started planning for the summit
conference a year ago. ``But now you are talking about having all
of the major players in the world coming into New York. It is going
to be a difficult week.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Friday that the city had budgeted $8
million in police overtime for the summit-conference week. That
could mean up to 6,000 extra officers on the street, which he said
were enough to deal with any chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Groups including adherents of the Chinese spiritual movement
Falun Gong and Iranians living in exile have announced plans to
join the spectacle. The authorities have identified the Cuban
Mission on Lexington Avenue as a particular place to avoid for
those who do not like their toes stomped or the contents of their
handbags thoroughly scrutinized. Fidel Castro is expected there
with noisy crowds to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is also not taking any chances with the West Nile
virus. He said that the United Nations Plaza and the rest of
Manhattan north of 23rd Street would be sprayed for mosquitoes
before the summit meeting began. Giuliani announced Friday that a
dead bird infected with the virus was discovered at the United
Nations' doorstep at 42nd Street and First Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember, this illness is potentially the most
dangerous for elderly people, and some of the people coming are
elderly,'' Giuliani said. ''So we want to make sure the U.N. is
clear and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Spriggs, the assistant director for protective operations
at the Secret Service, said the only event that compared to the
Millennium Summit in terms of VIP protection was the 50th
anniversary celebration at the United Nations in 1995. But even
then, there were only about 150 people who needed Secret Service
protection, compared with the 245 now on the Secret Service roster,
he said. Eighteen have been classified as particularly high
security risks, according to police, and President Clinton is
scheduled to stay for three days, a visit that on its own is enough
to turn much of Manhattan inside out.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service would not disclose details of its security
arrangements, but Spriggs said the demand for agents is so great
that vacations have been canceled and personnel are being drawn
from most of the service's 100 field offices, as well as from the
IRS, the Customs Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an overwhelming challenge to say the least,'' Spriggs
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the East River, the Coast Guard will be bogged down in
debris, not diplomacy. With a watchful eye on the river-facing
rooms of the United Nations complex, the Coast Guard will regulate
the downstream flow of city trash toward Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the city Department of Sanitation sends four barges,
each loaded with 620 tons of waste, from a transfer station in
College Point, Queens, to the Fresh Kills landfill every day. But
the river will be off-limits for such deliveries when summit
participants are using riverfront rooms because of vulnerability to
a possible terrorist attack. (Untidy views are a less pressing
issue.)
</P>
<P>
   The city has added a tugboat and three barges to its garbage
fleet to accommodate the expected backup, though no one can say for
sure how much trash will be affected and for how long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work on tides, so if the window of opportunity is available
at the time when the tide is low, we won't be able to navigate the
waters,'' said Peter Fenty, deputy commissioner of sanitation. ``If
the material can't be shipped down the river, it will be held there
until it can be shipped. We've added the extra barges because we
might have to stack.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Cmdr. Michael McAllister, chief of the Coast Guard's marine
response division, said the Coast Guard would also limit access to
the river for pleasure boats from East 35th Street to the
Queensboro Bridge at 59th Street. No boats will be allowed within
175 yards of the eastern Manhattan shoreline throughout the summit,
and at particular times, the entire width of the river will be
closed.
</P>
<P>
   About three dozen boats from the Coast Guard and the New York
Police Department will patrol the river and its bridges, as well as
the waterways near Kennedy Airport, where most of the summit's
dignitaries are scheduled to arrive and depart. A floating command
center will be set up on the Coast Guard cutter Bainbridge Island.
</P>
<P>
   What happens if, Hollywood style, an errant garbage barge
crashes through the barriers and sets course for the United
Nations?
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our Coast Guard units have crew members armed and
trained with general law-enforcement procedures,'' McAllister said.
</P>
<P>
   And the hoped-for marketing response? Yes, there is some
inconvenience, but New Yorkers always enjoy a good show.

MAJOR MONEY FOR MINOR-LEAGUE STADIUM STILL A GOOD BET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We can't turn back the clock.
</P>
<P>
   We can't make it 1950 again, as much as we might like to try.
</P>
<P>
   We can't buy a loaf of bread for 15 cents, or a gallon of gas
for a quarter or (ahem) a newspaper for a nickel.
</P>
<P>
   Those sepia-tinted days of long, languid Fort Worth summers when
the Cats were kings are but distant memories now.
</P>
<P>
   But we can rebuild LaGrave Field.
</P>
<P>
   And we should.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to rebuild LaGrave Field on Fort Worth's north side
seems to be on the fast track now that a consortium of area
investors, including former Rangers first baseman Pete O'Brien,
wants to put as many as five teams in the newly formed All American
Association.
</P>
<P>
   A Fort Worth team in a new LaGrave Field would be the jewel of
that Class-A equivalent independent league.
</P>
<P>
   Having not grown up in Fort Worth, my memories of LaGrave Field
and those boys of summer are others' memories.
</P>
<P>
   They do sound so very golden.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were wonderful nights,'' remembered Bobby Bragan, who
managed the Cats from 1948-52 and, at a still spry and lively 82,
will be the All American Association's first league commissioner.
``LaGrave was unique because it was the only ballpark I ever saw
with what they called Fuller's earth. It was dark gray, almost
black, on the base paths, but there was red clay on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   When the original LaGrave burned down in 1949, owner John Reeves
rebuilt the ballpark out of steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers were in there in those days and put nothing but
good ballplayers in here,'' Bragan said. ``It was a cozy ballpark.
You were close to the fans. It would be Weatherford Night one
night, Mineral Wells Night the next night, Watermelon Night the
next. You'd stick around and sit up in the stands with the fans
after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the feeling O'Brien and his seven partners want to
recapture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be great, wholesome family entertainment,'' said Michael
Halbrooks, one of the members of the consortium that hopes to
operate teams in Tyler, Texarkana and possibly Abilene by next
year, with Fort Worth and another area team, maybe even in Frisco,
north of Dallas, joining in 2002. Victoria; Baton Rouge, La.;
Hattiesburg, Miss.; Montgomery, Ala.; and Albany, Ga., are already
set to play next year.
</P>
<P>
   Halbrooks, who lives in Dallas and was co-founder of Events Inc.
there, is a former assistant commissioner of the Texas League and
former general manager of the Shreveport, La., franchise. He'll be
Fort Worth's first general manager.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who lives in Colleyville, will be director of player
development, finding and supplying managers, coaches and players
for the five teams the consortium plans to operate.
</P>
<P>
   He's already thinking about the possibility of convincing former
Rangers teammates Larry Parrish, Charlie Hough or Pete Incaviglia
to be the Fort Worth team's first manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have players still chasing their dreams,'' Halbrooks
said, ``and it'll be affordable for the fans. We're talking an
average ticket price of $5.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot dogs for a buck. Long necks for a buck and a half. Somebody
save me a seat.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be a salary cap in this league _ no Donald Fehr, thank
heavens _ of $75,000 for a three-month season _ for the entire
21-man roster. Player salaries will range from $1,000 a month to
$2,500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said the consortium, named the Texas Independent
Baseball Association, will start off owning probably 70 percent of
each its five franchises with local ownership taking on the other
30 percent. O'Brien said the proposed Fort Worth franchise is
already ``over-subscribed'' with potential local investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independent leagues like this have been highly successful all
over the country,'' said Halbrooks, pointing to the success of St.
Paul, Minn., and Shaumberg, Ill., in the Northern League, both also
in close proximity to one or more big league clubs. ``Attendance in
the minors has doubled in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal and Billy Ripken are putting a franchise in Aberdeen, Md.,
in the Atlantic League,'' Halbrooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some hurdles, but they're not overwhelming,''
O'Brien said. ``We've kicked around the idea of starting off in
Fort Worth next year at an upgraded high school field
\RGoldstein\S. Others think we should wait for the new LaGrave to
get built and do it up right there with a grand opening. We're
still considering all our options.''
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of Bragan as commissioner, even if he's mostly a
figurehead, Carroll Berringer as deputy commissioner and O'Brien
lend credibility to the league. But the key for Fort Worth is
getting a new LaGrave Field rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   If all the bells and whistles that city fathers have talked
about are added, including a Bobby Bragan Museum and a playground,
we're talking $8 million plus. There's even supposed to be a
trolley running from downtown to the north side, with a stop at the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   If Fort Worth can get some corporate sponsorship and sell naming
rights to the park, the city won't necessarily be on the hook for
all of it.
</P>
<P>
   We can't go back to 1950, but we can honor its memory and
reclaim a little piece of it in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we do want to turn back the clock a little bit,''
Bragan said.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Maybe some hot summer night on the north side of Fort
Worth sometime in the near future, we really can make 50 years
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth a try.

   TAIWAN-CHINA (Taipei, Taiwan) _ Since he came to power in May,
Taiwan's new president, Chen Shui-bian, has labored to convince
China that he is not a wild-eyed separatist, driven by dreams of
Taiwanese independence. But Chen's charm offensive has come to an

talk New York weighty: unspeakable traffic snarls and 170-some

   ILL-RICHES-SCHEME (Mattoon, Ill.) _ Money has never put in much

where the all-you-can-eat walleye special goes for $4.99. They work
at factories like the Lender's Bagel plant. So more than a few
eyebrows began arching when a handful of people in this small
central Illinois town suddenly seemed to be sitting pretty. A
former police officer built a house with a six-car garage. A
retired electrician started offering people interest-free loans.
This week, federal law enforcement officials gave foundation to
years of Mattoon gossip. They charged 11 Mattoon residents and
eight other people in a bogus financial investment scheme that,
authorities say, hoodwinked more than 10,000 people around the
world out of more than $12.5 million. By Pam Belluck. 900 words.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, Ira Glasser clams up. For several entire nanoseconds,
he is embarrassed and fumbling for words.
</P>
<P>
   He has waxed on for three hours, impossible to turn off, a
logorrheic torrent full of aggressive pride about the people he
associates with professionally: skinheads, Nazis, pornographers,
cultists, fascists, Communists and any additional species of -ists
that might offend the public.
</P>
<P>
   No question has come close to wobbling him. Did he suppress the
free-speech rights of his children? Is it awkward for a nice Jewish
guy from New York City to sit down with neo-Nazis? Does he ever
defend nice people? It is hard enough to get a question in, and he
grabs each one _ almost literally, his arms flailing over his desk
_ and answers it easily, with the calm assurance of a major league
hitter facing a Little League pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Then he is asked a question that stops him: Where is his
computer? The rush of words halts, and for an eighth of an instant
he has no idea what to say. ``You have discovered my Luddite
secret,'' Glasser admitted. Ruefully, he picked up a pen in one
hand and a yellow pad in the other and explained that he used them
rather than a computer, adding: ``They never crash. They never get
viruses.''
</P>
<P>
   Glasser, who is 62, has ushered the American Civil Liberties
Union into the new century, helping to transform it in his 22 years
as executive director, and yet, it turns out, he left himself
behind, at least in technological terms. But he will have time to
catch up and get his first cell phone and desktop computer, for the
ACLU will announce next week that he is retiring on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement will be a milestone for the 300,000-member
organization, and a nationwide search for a successor is already
beginning. But one of Glasser's legacies is that after having taken
over at a time of financial crisis, in the aftermath of the group's
defense of the right of Nazis to march in the heavily Jewish
community of Skokie, Ill., he leaves a smoothly running,
financially strong organization that he says (with the faintest
hint of regret) will get along just fine without him.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues say Glasser, for all his own lack of intimacy with
anything more technical than a pen and paper, will be remembered as
a modernizer _ as a 1960s rebel who turned himself into a
fund-raiser, manager and chief executive and who turned the ACLU
from a chaotic group of young lawyers in threadbare offices with
pizza crusts lurking under broken chairs into a quasi corporation
whose 18th-floor headquarters in Lower Manhattan have the hushed
feel of a law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ira Glasser changed,'' mused Samuel Walker, a professor of
criminal justice at the University of Nebraska who is the author of
a history of the ACLU. ``He was an issue-driven person, and never
in his wildest dreams _ or nightmares _ would he have thought of
becoming a manager. Now he can talk to you about mailings and their
response rates for two hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Glasser plans to devote his retirement not to grand new crusades
but to family, basketball and beaches. In a fund-raiser recently,
family members bought him the opportunity to play one-on-one for 10
minutes with the former Knick Walt Frazier _ and he nearly bursts
with pride as he relates that the game ended in a tie, 12-12.
</P>
<P>
   Glasser, born and raised in New York City, was an odd leader for
the ACLU, in that he never studied law. Until diverted by the
1960s, he was a math professor at Queens College and Sarah
Lawrence. It was good training: of all the audiences he has faced,
he says, none have been so hostile as college students in required
freshman calculus. Glasser joined the civil liberties union's New
York affiliate in 1967 and ever since has been energetically
defending the rights of people to express sentiments that he
abhors. One fond moment came in 1968, when George C. Wallace, whose
segregationist views were the opposite of Glasser's, was running
for president and was denied use of Shea Stadium to hold a rally.
Glasser went to meet Wallace's lieutenants and introduced them to
the lawyer he had arranged to defend their right to use the
stadium: Eleanor Holmes Norton, a black woman who is now the
District of Columbia's delegate to the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Nadine Strossen, the law professor who serves as ACLU president,
a nonmanagerial position, said Glasser's greatest legacy was to
have helped forge the group into a truly nationwide organization,
with 53 offices around the country. Another of his legacies, one
that annoyed some members, is that he developed a broader agenda
that not only emphasizes free speech, but also underscores gay
rights, legalized abortion, affirmative action, free expression on
the Internet and hostility to racial profiling. In addition, he has
put less emphasis on litigation and much more on cultivating public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if Glasser is not a lawyer and has helped move the ACLU
away from its traditional focus on the courts, callers trying to
reach him around midday are sometimes told that he is away because
of ``a very important court appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   That means he is off playing basketball.

OCTOBER TOUCH IS BACK FOR YANKS' HERNANDEZ
</HEADLINE>
  By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez induced Cristian Guzman's grounder
to Tino Martinez in the first inning, but he started late in
covering first base and then stopped running when the ball got to
Martinez. But Martinez bobbled the ball, and Hernandez was out of
position, about 30 feet from the base. Guzman was safe. Hernandez
bowed his head and tapped his hand against his chest, as if to say,
``My bad.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the last time that El Duque had to admonish himself
Friday night. It was almost the last time that the Minnesota Twins
had anything that resembled a scoring threat against Hernandez, who
pitched superbly again in guiding the Yankees to a 4-2 victory at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees began a draining period in which they have 31
straight games without a day off, and one player who needs to show
them that he can still be a significant contributor in the
postseason is El Duque.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Hernandez is doing that. He won his third consecutive
start by tossing eight strong innings in which he gave up two runs
and five hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing to me is the game that he threw tonight,''
Paul O'Neill said. ``Everybody knows that he can do it going down
the stretch and into the playoffs. That's the guy you want out
there. He's done it before.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre explained that he could see the gradual
improvement in Hernandez as he got ``a little sharper'' in each
start and raved, ``That's vintage stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill ripped a two-run homer in the first inning and Martinez
and Bernie Williams also socked homers off Brad Radke, a pitcher
who did not endear himself to the Yankees with comments he made in
July. After the Yankees battered Radke and beat the Twins, 9-5, on
July 28, he rationalized the defeat by saying: ``They have a $150
million payroll. They should win every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Radke wrong by about $40 million, he also offended
several Yankees. The Yankees took it personally that Radke was
basing their incredible success strictly on payroll. Obviously, the
Yankees have been superb, in part, because of George Steinbrenner's
willingness to spend. But the players also know there is more to
winning than who has the fattest payroll. The Baltimore Orioles are
a perennial example of spending and not succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a trying season for Hernandez, who went more than
five weeks without a victory in July and August because of
ineffectiveness and injuries. Hernandez irritated the Yankees when
he was activated by saying that a member of the Yankees' coaching
staff had said that he was not ``as hurt as much as I thought.''
Hernandez later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees do not care about what Hernandez said previously
or how he pitched previously. The Yankees do need him to pitch
reliably for the last month of the season so they can again depend
on him in October.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is 5-0 with a 1.02 earned run average in the last two
postseasons and he is finally giving the Yankees reasons to believe
that he might do that again. He struck out six, did not walk a
batter and pitched his best game since topping the Mets, 2-1, on
July 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he feels better and when you feel better you tend to
challenge people a little bit more,'' Torre said. ``I think he was
prouder of his stuff. Tonight, I thought he was back to where we
want him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez offered brief responses to reporters and would not
even say if he is 100 percent healthy and concluded: ``I feel
comfortable. I feel good. I hope to help the team achieve our
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill ran sprints in foul territory Friday while the Yankees
started batting practice and still felt pain in the hip pointer
that has bothered him for more than a week. O'Neill is a hitter,
not a sprinter. So, as O'Neill sprinted, he never let go of his
35-ounce bat.
</P>
<P>
   The first chance to use it came in the first and O'Neill did not
waste it as he blasted Radke's 1-1 fastball over the left-field
fence to make it 2-0. O'Neill swung, dropped his head like he
always does, peeked out to left and looked away again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised it went out,'' said O'Neill, who is still
slowed by the hip in the outfield and only played seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   David Ortiz's bloop double in the fifth ended Hernandez's streak
of retiring 10 in a row and he later scored on Jacque Jones'
booming double.. Ortiz's homer produced another run in the seventh,
but Hernandez pumped a fastball by Jones to preserve the 4-2 edge.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez trudged off the mound each inning like a man who was
carrying two kegs on his back. His shoulders slumped, his eyes
focused on the grass and his feet taking one small step at a time,
he was not in a rush. Maybe Hernandez was conserving energy, which
the Yankees should appreciate. This is going to be a long month and
he must be rested and ready for the Yankees to be totally ready for
the postseason.

BELCHER CLOSE, BUT ROLE IN QUESTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Tim Belcher threw seven scoreless innings pitching on
a rehabilitation assignment for Double-A Erie on Friday night. He
made 99 pitches, allowing four hits, striking out six and walking
none. He reached 89 mph on the radar gun and seems to be ready to
join the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   But how the 38-year-old Belcher will fit in with a staff that is
full of young pitchers remains to be seen. Belcher started Game 1
of the 1988 World Series for the Dodgers when three of the Angels'
current starters were still in junior high.
</P>
<P>
   However, manager Mike Scioscia won't commit to placing Belcher
into the starting rotation just yet, leaving open the option to use
him out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it comes down to getting it done,'' Scioscia said.
``You can talk all you want about intangibles. If it were only
about intangibles, I'd be catching and (pitching coach) Buddy Black
would be pitching. The bottom line is production. Certainly his
experience will be an asset, but it comes down to executing
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher executed his pitches Friday night and might be a
consideration to start Thursday in Detroit, potentially moving Kent
Mercker to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher hasn't pitched in a major-league game since July 2
because of a strained muscle in his right elbow. He had surgery on
the same elbow last off-season. In four starts this season, he is
2-2 with a 9.69 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Option No. 2: Jarrod Washburn is another option for Scioscia in
the starting rotation, but he is not as close as Belcher is to
returning.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn has a stress fracture in his left shoulder, but is
currently throwing without pain. He is scheduled to throw off the
mound again today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still hitting some bumps in the road,'' Scioscia said of
Washburn, who is 7-2 with a 3.74 ERA. ``But he's made consistent
progress, so he's still in the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   DE still DH: Darin Erstad started his seventh game in a row at
designated hitter Friday, still bothered by a strained muscle in
his rib cage that caused him to miss four games Aug. 20-23 in New
York and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad can hit but can't throw without pain. And he says the
club isn't being overly cautious with him because it's so late in
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way,'' Erstad said. ``If I could throw I'd be out
there.''

EDMONDS HOMER ENDS IT AS METS FIND NO RELIEF
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The New York Mets do not have a stolen base sign.
Most players steal on their own, sometimes with input from the
Mets' career stolen base leader, the first base coach Mookie
Wilson. This can apply to all the Mets, including the speedy rookie
Timoniel Perez, who made a very costly decision Friday night in his
first major league game.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who played in Japan last year and was not expected to
rise above Double-A this season, slapped a two-out single in the
ninth inning at Busch Stadium. Edgardo Alfonzo was batting and Mike
Piazza was on deck in a 5-5 game, but the Cardinals' bullpen was
stifling the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a don't-go sign, and that wasn't a don't-go
situation,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   So Perez went. And Cardinals catcher Mike Matheny threw him out
to end the inning. That was the Mets' last chance: with the
left-hander John Franco out because a sore pectoral muscle, Pat
Mahomes pitched the ninth and gave up a one-out home run to Jim
Edmonds that gave the Cardinals a 6-5 victory, their first in seven
games with the Mets this year.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Atlanta Braves also lost, the Mets held on to their
half-game lead in the National League East.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine seemed to blame himself for Perez's
daring on the basepaths. ``I don't like to see that out made with
Fonzie and Mike'' coming up, Valentine said. ``But I didn't hold
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Through an interpreter, Perez said he regretted his decision:
``Thinking about it, yeah, I wouldn't do it. The No. 3 hitter could
hit a double or a home run. In another situation, it would be
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes (4-3) believed this game would be different for him. The
right-hander had a dreadful August, and he spent Thursday's off-day
at home in Tyler, Texas, trying ``to get all the bad thoughts
out.'' His mind was clear and he had renewed confidence in his
fastball, deciding to stay with a pitch he had abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, he retired J.D. Drew on groundout off a cut
fastball. Then, Mahomes got ahead of Edmonds with two fastballs,
and he thought he could beat Edmonds with the pitch. Instead, it
became Edmonds' 37th home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to make the pitch I wanted to make, up at his chest,
inside and high _ he got it,'' said Mahomes, who has been scored on
in each of his last nine games. ``I may think about it a little bit
tonight, but when I come to the park tomorrow, it'll be what it is
_ in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had lost the lead in the seventh, when Edmonds singled
in a run off Dennis Cook to tie it, 5-5. They had gotten the lead
two innings earlier, when Matt Franco, who was outrighted to
Triple-A Norfolk in mid-August, delivered in his first plate
appearance since returning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After Robin Ventura led off the sixth with a home run that tied
the game, 4-4, Franco pinch-hit for starter Bobby J. Jones with one
out and runners at second and third. He lined Mike James' pitch the
opposite way, and left fielder Ray Lankford leaped for a twisting
catch. But the sacrifice fly scored Jay Payton to put the Mets
ahead, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Franco stayed in the game at first base when Rick White relieved
Jones, who allowed four runs on seven hits and a walk. He also
allowed a pair of stolen bases as the Cardinals showed off a new
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis attempted no steals in three games against the Mets in
July. But the first three Cardinals to reach base all ran on Jones
and Piazza, the catcher, and all three reached base before the
throw.
</P>
<P>
   Lankford, however, overslid second base in the second and was
tagged out for the second out of the inning. But Edgar Renteria
walked and promptly reclaimed second with a steal. One batter
later, Mike Matheny doubled him in to make it 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   The lead did not last long, partly because Jones improbably
sustained a rally. The pitcher, who hit .313 last year came into
the game 0 for 33 this year, bounced a curveball up the middle for
a single, moving Darryl Hamilton to third.
</P>
<P>
   After another out, Lenny Harris chopped a ball halfway up the
third base line. Craig Paquette fielded it, and his throw seemed to
beat Harris to first. But Harris was safe, the run scored and the
Mets had tied it, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   They took a 3-1 lead the next inning, when Jay Payton lined a
fastball into the left-center field bleachers for a two-run home
run. The Cardinals got a run back in the fifth on a one-out single
by Fernando Vina, then went ahead, 4-3, when J.D. Drew powered
Jones' first pitch 416 feet to right for a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Jones did not watch its flight, descending the mound with his
head down as soon as Drew connected.

RED SOX BEAT MARINERS
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No hyperbole here. Let the Red Sox gauge the enormity of the
challenge they waded into Friday night amid the grip of a Labor Day
heat wave and the rising pressure of a pennant race: ``This,''
declared Brian Daubach, ``is obviously our biggest homestand of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   And they launched it with a big-time effort from Rolando Arrojo,
the Cuban gold medalist in exile, who showed the most promising
signs yet that he could be the answer to the question, ``Who in the
name of Reggie Cleveland could start Game 2 of a playoff series
after Pedro Martinez?''
</P>
<P>
   Six days after he left a game in Kansas City after kicking an
object in frustration and hurting his ankle, Arrojo booted around
the Mariners in a 6-2 victory that helped the Sox stay a game back
of Cleveland in the American League wild-card scramble and five
behind New York in the East race.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox got an unusual burst of timely hitting, a couple of
singles from their new great hope, Dante Bichette, and a home run
from Carl Everett, his 33d of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The win kicked off a crucial 10-game homestand against Seattle,
Oakland, Minnesota, and the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the hunt,'' manager Jimy Williams said. ``And that's
what we talked about way back. That's good.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also why general manager Dan Duquette traded for Arrojo in
July, hoping his big-game experience, including a winning start in
the 1992 Olympics, could make a difference down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century after Cleveland started Game 2 of the 1975
American League Championship Series behind another Cuban, Luis
Tiant, Arrojo has started to look like posteason material. The Sox
have won the last six games he has started, including the last four
that have followed losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to help the team and do whatever I can to win,'' he
said through translator Ramon Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   All Arrojo did Friday night before 33,021 fans in the muggy Fens
was scatter five hits and a walk over seven innings. He allowed
only two runners to touch second base. And the only Mariner who got
to him was Carlos Guillen, who snaked an errant changeup around the
Pesky Pole for a solo home run with one out in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   And there was no hint of the frustration that caused his kicking
episode in Kansas City, even after Guillen's shot
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen again,'' he said. ``It was a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said the key to Arrojo's recent
success has been his control. Friday night, he threw strikes on the
first pitch to 19 of the 26 Mariners he faced.
</P>
<P>
   And, like Pedro Martinez, he was not shy about backing opposing
batters off the plate, keeping them off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a well-disciplined, patient team,'' Kerrigan said.
``They loved to get out ahead in their counts and then do their
damage. He prevented that by controlling the count.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox also controlled their destiny at the plate, interrupting
a season-long stretch of bad fortune in timely, two-out situations.
</P>
<P>
   After Arrojo and Seattle starter John Halama dueled through 5
1/2 innings, Nomar Garciaparra opened Boston's sixth with a single
down the right-field line. Everett looped a single to center,
moving Garciaparra to second and raising hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the familiar. Bichette failed to deliver, lifting a
fly to center that was too shallow for Garciaparra to advance. Troy
O'Leary was no help either, popping up to catcher Dan Wilson for
the second out.
</P>
<P>
   Up came Lou Merloni, who said he has recovered from the mild
concussion he suffered in Tuesday night's brawl at Tampa Bay.
Merloni had only five hits in his previous 34 at-bats (.147), but
he said he wasn't thinking about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking I was 0 for 2 for the day,'' he said. ``I just
go day to day and don't worry about what was in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But he knew he had swung at pitches out of the strike zone in
his first two at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to swing at a strike,'' he said. ``And I finally
got one and it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Merloni lined a double to right-center, scoring Garciaparra for
a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Jose Offerman, perhaps the team's greatest
disappointment at the plate this season. But Offerman, who was
hitting .206 with runners in scoring position, delivered, grounding
a single to right that scored both runners and made it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman took second on right fielder Al Martin's throw to the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got used to the way he was pitching,'' Offerman said of
Halama. ``We got him on his changeup.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Varitek then singled to left off the glove of shortstop
Alex Rodriguez and Offerman scampered home to give Arrojo and the
Sox and 4-0 cushion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inning was real big for us, seeing as how we haven't been
scoring runs the way would like,'' Varitek said.
</P>
<P>
   Everett made it 5-1 in the seventh when he drilled a 3-2 pitch
from Kevin Hodges over the Seattle bullpen for his 99th RBI.
</P>
<P>
   With Bichette batting cleanup, Everett moved up to third in the
order and Garciaparra moved up to second. Neither is likely to be
hurt with Bichette hitting behind them, discouraging opposing teams
from pitching around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully I can get hot and perform down the stretch,''
Bichette said.
</P>
<P>
   With no hyperbole, Bichette also noted the bonus of Everett
continuing his recent hot streak.
</P>
<P>
   Everett is hitting .333 with four home runs and 16 RBI in his
last 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he stays hot,'' Bichette said, ``he can really carry the
club through this race.''

AN EXPLANATION DODGERS FANS DESERVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This has been a big week for corporate contrition.
You can't switch on the TV without finding the chief executive
officer of some troubled airline, car maker or tire company on
screen in a commercial, apologizing for letting down the loyal
customer.
</P>
<P>
   How might this PR strategy - a company throwing itself on the
mercy of the consumer - be applied to a struggling sports
franchise?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've guessed where I'm going with this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, I'm Bob Daly. As managing partner, chairman and CEO of
the Los Angeles Dodgers, I feel a great responsibility to field a
team of which you, the baseball fan, can be proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly, his tie knotted and gray suit-jacket buttoned, speaks
earnestly to the camera while strolling down a ballpark aisle.
Soothing piano music is heard in the background and a graphic
announces: ``A Message from the Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us in the Dodgers front office are disappointed by the
results of the 2000 season. September is upon us and the team is
out of playoff contention. At this stage in years past Tommy
Lasorda would say, 'If we can just gain one game a week, we'll be
right back in the race.' However, I didn't swallow that baloney
then, and I don't believe it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I digress. You, the ticket-buying public, have a right to
be disheartened by the Dodgers' latest failure. And you have a
right to ask what we in the front office plan to do to win back
your confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is that we are launching an exhaustive internal
investigation, and club president Bob Graziano, general manager
Kevin Malone and I will not rest until we have determined the
causes of this year's underachievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are as perplexed as you, the luxury-suite-buying public, by
the pitching staff. Coming out of spring training, we felt it had a
delightfully entertaining combination of proven talent, experience,
competitiveness, explosive intensity and youthful immaturity. And
that's only Kevin Brown. Frankly, the addition of Mike Fetters and
Gregg Olson to the staff that recorded the National League's
seventh best ERA in 1999 hasn't produced the dramatic improvement
we expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mystery to us, and we aim to get to the bottom of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like you, the cable TV-subscribing public, we are not happy
with the everyday lineup. We departed Vero Beach anticipating an
explosive offense and solid defense. We had superstars in left and
right fields, and could reasonably expect both to enjoy career
years. We had a first baseman who finished in the top 10 in the
National League in combined runs and RBI in 1999. We had a catcher
who had saved up many hits and accurate throws in 1999. We had a
second baseman who was excited about the prospect of learning a new
position, a third baseman who seemed to be growing younger before
our eyes, and a shortstop who'd been resting for a year. Clearly,
our only question mark was in the center field-leadoff position.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a lineup like that, we couldn't understand why we weren't
allowed to skip the regular season and proceed directly to the
World Series, but we will figure it out and deliver the answers you
deserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like you, the Farmer John-buying public, we have been
encouraged by the team's occasional winning streaks. When we beat
up on the Expos, Cubs and Brewers recently, this confirmed we have
playoff-quality talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking a hard look at why the manager hasn't gotten
more wins out of that talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent $90 million this season in an effort to bring you,
the Budweiser-drinking public, the finest in baseball
entertainment. If we must spend $90.5 million next season, we will
do it. You have my word on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in Dodgers management promise to bring back the good old
days when Dodgers players, management and fans shared the happy
bond of optimism. Until that happens, let's wait `til next year ...
together!
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you.''

HACKETT SHOWS THAT HE'S SERIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Coach Paul Hackett officially ended USC's
honeymoon period with a dose of tough love Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett briefly banished his team from the field and restarted
practice, unhappy with the Trojans' mental focus at the conclusion
of a bye week following the 29-5 victory over Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 25 minutes into a scheduled two-hour practice,
Hackett interrupted a punting drill and pointed toward the door.
The team walked out, did a quick U-turn on McClintock Avenue and
started practice over, including stretching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'I'm not going to put up with this,' '' said Hackett,
who used the same tactic at least once last year in fall practice
at UC Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was thinking about something else. As soon as you
have any kind of success, or failure, outside influences start to
affect you.''
</P>
<P>
   The poor start was quickly forgotten, as Hackett praised the
team's intensity during the rest of the practice, which included
full-speed contact drills between the first-team offense and
defense and goal-line situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled that it happened,'' Hackett said. ``That's why
(the field) is gated in, so they can put everything else aside and
focus on football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have no practice than a bad practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut man: Fullback Charlie Landrigan showed his ability to break
open holes for the Trojans tailbacks during the Penn State game,
but apparently he's not quite as adept with windows.
</P>
<P>
   Landrigan sliced open two of the fingers on his right hand on
Tuesday night while attempting to open a window in his off-campus
residence. The wound required a trip to the hospital for stitches
and Landrigan sat out Friday's practice, although he expects to
return on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a really old house and when I tried to push up the
window, my hand went right through the glass,'' Landrigan said.
``It was a really freak thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Landrigan, a fourth-year junior, is coming off the best game of
his college career. He earned high praise from the coaching staff
for his work at fullback, which included a crushing block in the
third quarter. He also recorded his first-ever rushing yards on a
3-yard carry in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this play ... and we always practice it but I never
thought we would run it,'' Landrigan said. ``So (quarterback Carson
Palmer) comes into the huddle and says, 'Here you go Chuck, this is
your chance.' I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Break time: The Trojans will not practice today or Monday, but
will have a two-hour evening session Sunday, which will prevent the
players from having too much fun during the Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put yourself in their position. 'I can go to Baja, I can go to
Vegas,' '' Hackett said, grinning widely at the thought of what his
players would do with three days off. ``The great part is that most
of the team is from Southern California, so they can spend time
with their families.''

VALDES IMPRESSIVE IN DODGERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ismael Valdes didn't get the win, but he at least
bought himself more time in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes went seven innings Friday against Philadelphia, giving up
just three hits and no earned runs in an eventual 2-1 win that was
preceded by manager Davey Johnson complaining about the
ineffectiveness of the Los Angeles Dodgers starters - particularly
Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes retired the first six batters he faced and allowed only
two baserunners through the first five innings as he engaged in a
pitching duel with Phillies starter Randy Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes was removed for a pinch hitter in the seventh with the
game tied 1-1 and the Dodgers went on to win in front of 28,383 at
Dodger Stadium thanks to Adrian Beltre's 15th home run of the year,
a two-out shot in the eighth off reliever Chris Brock.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the team wins when I pitch, that's all that
counts,'' said Valdes, who still hasn't recorded a victory with the
team this season. ``We need to win.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the type of game the Dodgers need on a consistent basis
from the bottom half of their rotation if their dwindling hopes of
a playoff berth are to last much longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been taxing,'' Johnson said. ``Probably the most
frustrating thing is we haven't been able to establish the guys in
the rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers pitchers can't handle the type of batters they
face on the current homestand - some of the opposing teams are more
than 20 games out of first place - it's unlikely they'll do much
better the rest of the way in a schedule loaded with teams with
better records.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson isn't complaining about what Kevin Brown (12-5), Chan Ho
Park (14-8) and, during the second half, Darren Dreifort (10-7)
have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the fabulous five aren't doing what they've gotta
do,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In Valdes' seven previous starts since being traded back to the
Dodgers from the Cubs on July 26, the right-hander was 0-2 with a
7.33 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's performance was better than most of the ones the
Dodgers received from Valdes in 1999. Valdes had a 3.98 ERA last
season, but went 9-14.
</P>
<P>
   This time, his own two-base error on a pickoff attempt hurt
Valdes more than any of the Phillies batters.
</P>
<P>
   A batter after Marlon Anderson led off the third inning with a
single just out of the reach of a diving Beltre at third for
Philadelphia's first hit, Valdes' wild throw advanced Anderson to
third. A groundout by Tomas Perez scored Anderson to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies started the fourth with another leadoff single, but
Valdes induced a double-play grounder on the next pitch to get out
of the inning facing the minimum number of batters.
</P>
<P>
   He retired the side in order in the fifth and got two outs in
the sixth before walking Bobby Abreu. However Abreu was caught
stealing to allow Valdes to get out of another inning facing only
three batters.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took the initial lead in the first when Shawn Green
doubled in Mark Grudzielanek after Wolf had walked two of the first
three batters he faced. A fly to right by Eric Karros put runners
at the corners for Green.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, from El Camino Real High of Woodland Hills and Pepperdine,
opened the second by issuing his third walk, but settled down and
went seven innings without allowing another run and striking out
eight.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters (6-2) pitched a perfect eighth inning to earn the
win but apparently pulled a muscle in his left side after fielding
a bunt by Perez and making a hurried throw to first for the third
out. Jeff Shaw got his 23rd save by pitching the ninth.

WITHOUT KIRALY, AMERICAN BEACH VOLLEYBALL IN FLUX
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The most recognizable figure in beach volleyball
will not represent the U.S. in the 2000 Olympic Games. But the
dislocated shoulder that forced Karch Kiraly out of contention for
the second qualifying spot on the Olympic team doesn't mean his
influence won't be felt.
</P>
<P>
   Kiraly, a three-time Olympic gold medalist - two indoor and one
when beach volleyball debuted in 1996 - has been working with the
women's top team of Jenny Johnson Jordan and Annett Davis as an
unofficial assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was attempting to qualify again, and I thought we were
really putting it together at the right time,'' Kiraly said,
referring to his partner Adam Johnson. ``I felt bad for my partner
... I can say at least I've gone three times, but I was trying hard
to go for a fourth time.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kiraly makes the transition away from Olympic competition,
although not on his own terms, others seem to be prepared to carry
on the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The fact the No. 2 team - not the top team - is the one with the
budding superstars is reason for optimism. Dain Blanton, who has
graced his share of magazine covers recently, teams with Eric
Fonoimoana, the former Southern Section swimming champion who is
head volleyball coach at his alma mater, Mira Costa High.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton and Fonoimoana are seeded ninth in the 24-team Olympic
draw and face No. 16 Oliver Oetke and Andreas Scheuerpflug of
Germany Sept. 17 at Sydney's Bondi Beach in the preliminary round.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Heidger and Kevin Wong, the top American team, take their
No. 7 seed into the prelims against Canadians Jody Holden and
Conrad Leinemann, No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing because (Kiraly) is not going, but it's an
opportunity to build the next Karch Kiraly,'' AVP Tour CEO William
Berger said. ``There's a lot of personalities out here, a lot of
great players that could be the next super guy. I think that we are
looking at a transition in the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanton and Fonoimoana showed they're capable of winning Olympic
gold with their performance in the U.S. Open of Beach Volleyball at
Seal Beach from Aug. 18-20. In a situation unique to men's beach
volleyball, Olympic qualifiers from many countries are regular
participants in AVP Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton and Fonoimoana fought their way to the finals of the
winners' bracket at Seal Beach. They faced Brazil's top team of
Emanuel Rego and Jose Loiola, seeded No. 2 (behind an Australian
team) in the Olympics and considered the gold-medal favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Rego and Loiola won 15-12 in the winners-bracket final and then
again in the championship match 19-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an honor to play this team (again) in the Olympic
finals,'' said Loiola, who, like the other foreign team members on
the AVP Tour, has a strong American following. The relationship is
akin to the one between American fans and foreign NBA players who
compete for their homeland in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. in transition, it is highly unlikely they will
match the `96 Atlanta Games, where Kiraly and Kent Steffes won the
gold and Mike Dodd and Mike Whitmarsh took the silver. Blanton and
Fonoimoana are medal contenders but Heidger and Wong are longshots.
</P>
<P>
   So, as U.S. men's beach volleyball searches for a new identity,
the performance of the 2000 Olympic team might mean everything - or
it might mean nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing you can do as an athlete is to play for your
country,'' Fonoimoana said. ``I don't consider that we're under any
added stress (because of the identity crisis). It's more like added
honor.''

ERSTAD, GLAUS SHINE IN ANGELS LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Darin Erstad broke the Anaheim Angels' single-season
hits record Friday night. Troy Glaus tied the Angels' single-season
home run record.
</P>
<P>
   But after their game against the Chicago White Sox, the Angels'
clubhouse was as quiet as a morgue. The Angels blew a six-run lead
and fell to the White Sox 9-8 before a crowd of 16,377 at Comiskey
Park.
</P>
<P>
   It was perhaps the Angels' most disappointing loss of the season
and it came at a time when defeats are magnified. A victory, which
seemed certain when they took an 8-2 lead after Mo Vaughn's grand
slam, would have moved the Angels to within three games of
first-place Seattle in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the White Sox rallied for one run in the seventh and
six in the eighth to spoil the Angels' September debut under rookie
manager Mike Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you don't win it's a missed opportunity with the
season at the stage it is,'' Scioscia said. ``But we're not in a
situation of any kind of panic. We're still confident in what we
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad and Glaus put their stamp on the Angels record book in a
four-run first inning. Erstad singled to left field to tie Alex
Johnson's 30-year-old record of 202 hits. After a two-run triple by
Garret Anderson, Glaus hit his 39th home run of the season, tying
Reggie Jackson's club record set in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad broke Johnson's record in the second inning with a double
for hit No. 203. He got his 204th hit - an infield single - in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Erstad downplayed the significance of the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in the off-season I'll think about that,'' said Erstad,
who raised his average to .364. ``Honestly, my focus is, 'What can
I do every day to help the team win.' I say that to myself every
day. You have to have that frame of mind. You can not afford to
think about the other stuff. Then afterwards, you can look at what
you did and say, 'OK, I need work here and I need work there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus likewise wouldn't revel in tying Jackson. Asked if it has
sunk in that he is alongside Jackson in the record book, Glaus
replied: ``It's sunk in that we lost the game. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox entered the eighth inning trailing 8-3, but jumped
on Angels reliever Al Levine immediately. Frank Thomas led off with
a homer - No. 39, tying him with Glaus and Carlos Delgado for the
league lead - to make it 8-4. Magglio Ordonez followed with another
homer to make it 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   When Carlos Lee singled in the next at-bat, Scioscia brought in
Shigetoshi Hasegawa (8-4), who got two outs sandwiched around a
single by Paul Konerko. That brought up Charles Johnson with what
turned out to be the pivotal play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hit a ground ball to the hole at shortstop. Glaus ranged
to his left from third base and cut in front of shortstop Kevin
Stocker, but could only deflect the ball into shallow left field.
Stocker appeared to have a play on the ball and time to throw out
the slow-footed Johnson. Instead, it was an RBI single and it kept
the inning alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake, man, I went too far,'' Glaus said. ``I
looked up and Stocker was right behind me. It's my fault. I went
too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia defended his third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy Glaus has a tremendous amount of range, but on that play
it hurt us,'' he said. ``To me, in my mind that was not a mistake.
It was an aggressive play. I'm glad to see Troy going hard after
it. Obviously as the guys play together longer they will understand
each other's range. But by no means was it a bad play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Durham followed with an RBI double down the left-field line
to make it 8-7, and Jose Valentin got the clincher, hitting a
blooper into center field to score two runs to push the White Sox
ahead 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Hasegawa's pitches were tough pitches that Durham and
Valentin were barely able to get enough of to put the ball in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was down and away, a sinker, I think it was a ball,''
Hasegawa said of the pitch Valentin hit. ``Sometimes you close your
eyes and get a hit.''

   Abbie Hoffman, Yippie, media performer and author, was the
say-no-to-war, yes-to-drugs face of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and his seven years underground, fleeing a 1973 charge
of dealing cocaine, are the subject of a new film, ``Steal This
Movie,'' which may enlighten young Americans who know some '60s
music but regard his life and times as remote from their own
dot-com lives. The movie's associate producer, Hoffman's longtime
lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, recently said, ``Now you can't trust
anyone under 30.''
</P>
<P>
   The founder of the Youth International Party, Hoffman died in
1989, in an apparent suicide. His Yippie stunts included scattering
dollar bills at the New York Stock Exchange, causing a near
stampede; plotting to disrupt the 1968 Democratic National
Convention, resulting in him being charged with conspiracy, and
leading to the famous Chicago Seven trial; and nominating a pig for
president.
</P>
<P>
   He became an environmental activist while in hiding. He
surrendered in 1980 and served a brief sentence. Throughout his
life Hoffman wrote, including the letters below to his brother,
Jack, who ran the family's medical supply company in Worcester,
Mass. His correspondence and FBI documents, along with items like
red, white and blue socks, were recently given to the University of
Connecticut in Storrs by his brother.

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) On Feb. 14, 1970, jurors began deliberating
in the Chicago Seven trial. Judge Julius J. Hoffman had declared
Hoffman, his co-defendants and their lawyers in contempt of court
159 times. Writing to his brother, three days later, Hoffman
describes his sentence of eight months in prison as laughably
lenient. (END ITALICS HERE)

Grossinger's but we really socked in a hell of a case. ... I was
lucky on the contempt. I should of got over 2 years everybody
thinks he made a mistake. He is a total nut. Boston will be a very
heavy scene if the verdict comes down against us as will a lot of
places. Already a (POUND SIGN) of bombs have gone off &AMP; thousands
of demonstrations ... The tendency for the liberals is to just
sweat about the lawyers &AMP; forget us, which ain't too good. There
should be a demonstration at the Federal Bldg. Saturday if possible
_ there are a lot of things to do &AMP; quick. Before it's all

<P>
   I've just been moved out of isolation. Just so the newsmen could
see me in a cage that was clean and neat. It's unbelievable. I was
told it's illegal for the guards to sell mug shots to the
newspapers, yet I'm told our pictures are all in every paper today,
as I predicted. ... The Warden made a special deal with them. It's
so obscene, just like I said in my closing statement: ``Delilah is
waiting in the wings; (our) heads will be shaved just like in Nazi
Germany. Tomorrow they will sell the hair outside the prison
walls.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   I hear on the news now they are bragging they clipped 12 inches
of hair off me. Jerry (Rubin) and I were dragged down 4 floors, but
they don't tell that part. It was the bloodiest haircut in penal
history. The newsmen that come through here are taken on a
whirlwind smear tour with no conversation allowed between them and
us. Everything they write about our stay is untrue and just public
relations bullshit carried on by the Warden's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry (Rubin) and I have lost a lot of weight. The food is unfit
for human consumption. A system of informers and guards is always
present in an attempt to ferret out information. This letter is
even written at great risk because if anything is known, I'll get
isolated and beaten again _ but I must speak out. There are people
in need of medical and psychiatric care who are not receiving it.
If you're not in isolation like I was, there is a bad bed shortage.
Last night, my first night out. I was moved into Dave's ward _ D-1.
I sleep on the bench in the waiting room for there aren't enough
beds.
</P>
<P>
   The warden had orders to cut off our hair now rather than wait
until next week in the event we got bail and were let out on the
streets. ... Jerry (Rubin) and I had to be handcuffed to the chair.
I began to understand for the first time why barber shop poles are
red, white and blue. Those colors have come to represent the sadism
and brutality present in Amerikan thinking and policy.
</P>
<P>
   All Amerika is a prison. The president is a warden and the
people are all inmates.
</P>
<P>
   love,
</P>
<P>
   Abbie
</P>
<P>
   I just saw the haircut story on TV and it is a total obscene
lie. I never said anything the way they said except that ``it was
an act of racism.'' They all want to make it sound cute but my
long-haired brothers and sisters will understand the truth of it
and see through their short-haired pig lies.

<P>
   Well what can I say. It was agonizing to see you through the
glass darkly. It's Labor Day _ hot _ oh, about 105 in here. I'm in
much better shape than when you were here but I have trouble
holding the pen right since my writing finger has a huge bunion
from finishing my last book . ... There's not much I can say about
the arrest in a letter. There is a good chance of a legal defense
based on the theory you and I agreed on when you visited. Things
have made some movement along these lines of investigation and we
could discuss this better if you were in New York when I got out
probably in a week. Meanwhile, could you try to sell the Steal This
Book's (that) you have.
</P>
<P>
   First call Dick Glassman at Irvall Distributors if you can't
reach him, Danny Zimmerman has his number. Danny is at Lancer Books
in New York City (on Broadway). Sell them 70(CENTS) each. If
Glassman doesn't buy them then ship them all, or the remainder, to
Barry Reid in Westminster, Calif. You should have his address from
a postcard I sent you a few weeks ago asking you to send him 600
books.
</P>
<P>
   He's giving me 25(PERCENT) of the profits in a mail order
operation handling everything in my next book. Which is already
completed. We worked out a nice contract with lawyers etc. I'm
counting on ``honor among thieves.'' ... The publisher wants to
print 300,000 now. First run I hope in 2 years Barry could do a
revision of the book &AMP; we'd split profits on it &AMP; all subsequent
ones. ... That way I could have an income for some time.

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In February 1974, Hoffman jumped bail and
disappeared, living as a fugitive in the United States and in
Europe until he surrendered in 1980. He uses a pseudonym in the
following letter, which was written on stationery from the St.
Moritz Hotel in New York City, shortly after the death of his
father, John, on March 27, 1974. (END ITALICS HERE)

<P>
   Hello Jack!!
</P>
<P>
   Sorry we couldn't get together last time you were here in New
York. I was tied up a little. Getting along just fine. Staying out
of trouble mostly. Sorry about you having to take all
responsibility for dad's death but suppose you have some mixed
feelings about it all ... I learned about it peeling off the
bandages. New looks are incredible _ I ... write a lot _ take voice
&AMP; karate lessons to change voice and gait and for discipline. I've
not seen anyone I love for 3 months. Seems forever _ I'm writing a
host of letters to folks now because I plan to go into a more
isolated state than now even in another month and maybe even stop
writing. Although I don't feel too much heat on the scene _ have to
dig in for the long haul. Lawyers all over the world are working on
things but I like it here in U.S. anyway &AMP; want to finish my next
book. It will take at least that. It's good if papa didn't get a
chance to read it. Wrote mama a letter &AMP; assume she showed it to
you. Anxious to hear how you are handling everything. Maybe there's
something I have to sign or something although notarization could
be a problem. Now couldn't it? Lefcourt, by the way, has full power
of attorney for me _ legally &AMP; can sign anything.

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) On Aug. 28, 1973, Hoffman was arrested for
trying to sell $36,000 worth of cocaine to undercover police
officers. About a week later, he wrote to his brother about his
arrest and with instructions for sales of his 1971 book, ``Steal
This Book.'' (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 3, 1973
</P>
<P>
   Jack:
</P>
<P>
   Well what can I say. It was agonizing to see you through the
glass darkly. It's Labor Day _ hot _ oh, about 105 in here. I'm in
much better shape than when you were here but I have trouble
holding the pen right since my writing finger has a huge bunion
from finishing my last book . ... There's not much I can say about
the arrest in a letter. There is a good chance of a legal defense
based on the theory you and I agreed on when you visited. Things
have made some movement along these lines of investigation and we
could discuss this better if you were in New York when I got out
probably in a week. Meanwhile, could you try to sell the Steal This
Book's (that) you have.
</P>
<P>
   First call Dick Glassman at Irvall Distributors if you can't
reach him, Danny Zimmerman has his number. Danny is at Lancer Books
in New York City (on Broadway). Sell them 70(CENTS) each. If
Glassman doesn't buy them then ship them all, or the remainder, to
Barry Reid in Westminster, Calif. You should have his address from
a postcard I sent you a few weeks ago asking you to send him 600
books.
</P>
<P>
   He's giving me 25(PERCENT) of the profits in a mail order
operation handling everything in my next book. Which is already
completed. We worked out a nice contract with lawyers etc. I'm
counting on ``honor among thieves.'' ... The publisher wants to
print 300,000 now. First run I hope in 2 years Barry could do a
revision of the book &AMP; we'd split profits on it &AMP; all subsequent
ones. ... That way I could have an income for some time.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In February 1974, Hoffman jumped bail and
disappeared, living as a fugitive in the United States and in
Europe until he surrendered in 1980. He uses a pseudonym in the
following letter, which was written on stationery from the St.
Moritz Hotel in New York City, shortly after the death of his
father, John, on March 27, 1974. (END ITALICS HERE)

<P>
   Hello Jack!!
</P>
<P>
   Sorry we couldn't get together last time you were here in New
York. I was tied up a little. Getting along just fine. Staying out
of trouble mostly. Sorry about you having to take all
responsibility for dad's death but suppose you have some mixed
feelings about it all ... I learned about it peeling off the
bandages. New looks are incredible _ I ... write a lot _ take voice
&AMP; karate lessons to change voice and gait and for discipline. I've
not seen anyone I love for 3 months. Seems forever _ I'm writing a
host of letters to folks now because I plan to go into a more
isolated state than now even in another month and maybe even stop
writing. Although I don't feel too much heat on the scene _ have to
dig in for the long haul. Lawyers all over the world are working on
things but I like it here in U.S. anyway &AMP; want to finish my next
book. It will take at least that. It's good if papa didn't get a
chance to read it. Wrote mama a letter &AMP; assume she showed it to
you. Anxious to hear how you are handling everything. Maybe there's
something I have to sign or something although notarization could
be a problem. Now couldn't it? Lefcourt, by the way, has full power
of attorney for me _ legally &AMP; can sign anything.

<P>
   Football season is here again, and as anyone who has been to a
high school or college game in recent years knows, this is not your
Aunt Gidget's cheerleading squad anymore. Today's cheerleaders
tumble, vault, build human pyramids _ and sometimes exhibit higher
athletic skill than the teams they're rooting for. Like gymnasts,
cheerleaders work with coaches, choreographers and physical
trainers, often attending summer boot camps to prepare for both the
sidelines and competitions with other squads.
</P>
<P>
   After years of disregard and even ridicule, cheerleading is back
and bigger than ever, with a steely, aerobicized attitude that's a
long way from old-fashioned pom-poms and sis-boom-bahs. This
summer, Hollywood released two major high-school cheerleader
movies: ``But I'm a Cheerleader!'' and ``Bring It On,'' a hit that
depicts cheerleaders as serious athletes and socially responsible
citizens. And cheerleading is being pushed as a potential Olympic
sport in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Today's cheerleading supports an industry of fashion and sports
suppliers, instructors, sports doctors, competition organizers and
glossy publications. ``Where else can a teen-age girl stand up in
front of thousands of people and tell them what to do?'' a
cheerleader asks in an ad in American Cheerleader magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The following excerpts, gleaned from the magazine and its Web
site (www.americancheerleader.com), suggest some of the forces at
play in the brave new world of cheerleader empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Vince Lombardi would have been proud:
Today's cheerleaders are tough as nails and can play with pain.
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   To many, falling from stunts represents the adverse side of
cheerleading. Yet in a controlled environment, it's really not!
Cheerleaders should know that without failure there would be no
success.
</P>
<P>
   Serious knee injuries are not just for boys!
</P>
<P>
   Do you need a fun way to get in shape for the summer, but hate
those boring step classes and supermodel workout videos? Try
kickboxing!
</P>
<P>
   Hi! I'm a junior high cheerleader (and) I have an idea: Liberty
turn with advanced stunts. Start facing to the left of the crowd,
go into a lib and do an arabesque, then turn and have your flyer
kick a stretch heel, turn again and your flyer will do a waterfall,
then turn and kick a heel stretch and turn again to your starting
point and pull one more waterfall, then cradle. It's an awesome
stunt. I did it on my first try. Good luck!
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Not that the modern cheerleader is
completely squeaky clean. A half-page ad for Glass Chalk, an ink
marker used to make washable graffiti on glass, depicts a
mischievous-looking cheerleader with marker in hand, posed beside
summer-camp snapshots showing windows scrawled with gently taunting
insults against opposing teams. The ad's text says: (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   What we did last summer: Did you hear about cheer camp? ... We
left our team's mark (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) everywhere! (END ITALICS
HERE) It was sooo awesome. You can't believe what a little Glass
Chalk does for team spirit! But no worry. It washes right off any
glass window with a wet paper towel.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) A little community outreach never hurts,
especially if spreading cheer can raise your squad's visibility.
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   You've heard the complaint time and time again: The cheerleading
team doesn't get enough support. You're athletes, so why does all
of the attention focus on football and basketball and not on you?
You're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   While the student body celebrates the biggest game of the week,
they probably don't even know that your golf team is undefeated and
your swim team is ranked first in the state. As the spirit leaders
in your school, you can help gain support for (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)
every (END ITALICS HERE) sport and bring added attention to the
cheer squad in the process. A fall sports pep rally dedicated
strictly to these athletes will show them they are important to the
school.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) And hey, don't we all want to share that
invincible team spirit? Even trumpet players and classroom
wiseacres are vulnerable.(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Stereotypes say that the cheerleaders and the band never get
along. Here are some suggestions to help make you and the band a
spirit unit: Teach them some cheers. ... Put them on the sidelines
with you. ... Invite a few down to do one of your cheers with you,
maybe in the later part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   And you know that kid in your history class who always keeps
everyone else laughing? Invite him or her to use those ``class
clowning'' skills and join you on the sidelines, running back and
forth painted in school colors and flashing ``Go! Fight! Win!''
signs to get the crowd to yell along with you.

   The Good News About `Going Postal'
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20, 1986, an Oklahoma postal worker shot and killed 14
co-workers, then himself. In the years since, there have been other
incidents of violence and murder, sometimes multiple murder, by
current or former postal workers.
</P>
<P>
   On Aprril 17, 1994, in his ``On Language'' column in The New
York Times Magazine, William Safire discussed whether ``going
postal'' meant ``losing it'' or ``not being online.'' It was the
first time that ``going postal'' appeared in The Times.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is linguistic history. Three-year-olds know what going
postal means.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Postal Service happy about this? Not at all. So, calmly,
it commissioned a lengthy study on workplace safety, a study that _
with charts and myriad statistics _ strikes out at the notion that
your friendly letter carrier is likely, at any moment, to whip an
Uzi out of his mail pouch.
</P>
<P>
   ```Going postal' is a myth, a bad rap,'' the report says.
``Postal workers are no more likely to physically assault, sexually
harass, or verbally abuse their coworkers than employees in the
national workforce.'' Retail workers, it says, are eight times as
likely as postal workers to be victims of homicide at work.
</P>
<P>
   The study is a serious one. ``The level of violence throughout
the American workplace is unacceptably high,'' it says, and offers
a variety of remedies. But it also seems intent on clearing the
Postal Service's tainted name, noting that part of the problem is
that it has so many workers _ as a civilian employer, it's second
only to Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be rough. A new expression, once it has burst from
the starting gate, is awfully hard to call back. And ``going
Wal-Mart'' just doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   A Restaurant That's All Lobby
</P>
<P>
   Washington lobbyists, shod in tasseled loafers, once inspired
someone to describe their eager, sartorially enhanced gatherings
outside the closed doors of congressional hearing rooms as Gucci
Gulch. Now they have their own watering hole, the Caucus Room, and
the list of investors is top heavy with a who's who of lobbyocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it has more private dining rooms than any other
Washington restaurant. Thomas H. Boggs Jr., one of its largest
investors and one of the town's best-known lobbyists (his father,
Hale, was a Democratic leader in the the House, his mother, Lindy,
a former congresswoman from Louisiana and now ambassador to the
Vatican), provided a simple explanation. So many closed doors, he
said, make it possible to keep people like House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, a Republican, and Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, a
Democrat, from running into each other during fund-raising events.
Not so incidentally, lobbyists can deduct as much of their visits
as business expenses as possible _ 100 percent for a banquet, but
only 50 percent for a regular meal.
</P>
<P>
   The roster of the Caucus Room's 65 shareholders includes Michael
Brown, the son of the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, as well as
James Lake, the deputy campaign manager for the 1992 Bush campaign.
It practically guarantees a full house nightly. And if political
junkies watch the comings and goings of the private dining rooms
carefully, they might just be able to figure out the
behind-the-scene machinations that make Washington tick.
</P>
<P>
   In a town where politics has become a very nasty business, the
lobbyists have put aside their differences and come together in one
of their few bipartisan efforts, offering a culinary venue that
fairly sizzles with accommodation _ a steakhouse.
</P>
<P>
   A Missile Defense Strategy That Will Have to Wait  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton left to his successor the decision on whether
to deploy a national missile defense system. He said he would not
do so himself because of test failures and diplomatic disputes. The
president, speaking at Georgetown University, said he had decided
not to act after two huge $100 million tests of the system failed
to intercept incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said more time is also needed to find a diplomatic
solution to what has been a growing confrontation between the
United States and Russia and China, staunch opponents to a U.S.
missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temps, Unite  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The labor movement has long been eager to unionize temp workers
because they are such a fast-growing group and because they often
receive inferior pay and benefits. But for years they were off
limits because they were not allowed to join unions unless the user
company and temp agency agreed _ something that rarely happened.
The National Labor Relations Board opened the door to forming such
unions by ruling that they no longer needed the temp agency's
permission to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Awards After an Uprising
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 former inmates who were beaten during the 1971
Attica prison uprising will split $8 million as part of a
settlement with New York state, a federal judge ruled. The awards,
which range from $6,500 to $125,000, punctuate a protracted legal
battle stemming from the uprising, in which 43 people died. Still,
the judge said many survivors ``remain casualties because of
lingering physical problems and the inability to erase memories of
Attica.''
</P>
<P>
   No Terminator, Please
</P>
<P>
   The computer scientists at Brandeis University have created the
first robotic system that can design and build other robots with
almost no human help. The technique will merely speed up the
process of designing robots, said Dr. Jordan B. Pollack, a
professor of computer science at Brandeis and one of the
researchers, and sharply drop the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Crime Continues to Decline
</P>
<P>
   Violent crime in the United States dropped last year to its
lowest level since the government began its annual national crime
survey 26 years ago. Law enforcement officials credited
crime-prevention programs, anti-gun campaigns, more police on the
street, tougher sentencing and a healthy economy producing jobs.
The rate of violent crime declined 10.4 percent in 1999, the
Justice Department said, while crimes against property dropped 8.9
percent. But there still were an estimated 28.8 million violent and
property crimes committed last year.
</P>
<P>
   The French and Corsica
</P>
<P>
   A plan by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France to give limited
self-rule to the island of Corsica has caused turmoil in France's
political class and led Interior Minister Jean Pierre Chevenement
to resign in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Any degree of regional autonomy is a deeply sensitive
constitutional issue in France. But the plan has also gained wide
backing, including from Corsicans, because it aims to strengthen
moderates and end the violent campaign of separatists, who have
thrown bombs and practiced political killings for almost three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the Aryan Nations  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to seize the compound of the Aryan Nations, Morris
S. Dees Jr. went to court in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Dees, founder of
the Southern Poverty Law Center, has won a series of civil right
suits against the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations in a
campaign to drive them out of business. The Aryan Nations compound
has been a base for white supremacists for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   His suit contends that compound guards, the Aryan Nations, its
82-year-old founder, Richard Girnt Butler, and his second in
command, Michael Teague, should be held liable for an attack on a
woman and her son, both white, by the guards in July 1998. Dees'
goal is to win a large judgment that will force the group to
surrender their compound in payment.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant Influx in Nevada
</P>
<P>
   By one measure, at least, the future of America seems to be at
the gambling table. The Census Bureau estimated that jobs in Las
Vegas lured so many people that Nevada grew the fastest of any
state in the 1990s, with its population rising 50 percent. Many of
those pouring in to build or staff casinos and hotels were
Hispanics and Asians, the nation's fastest-growing minority groups.
California, though, still has the largest Hispanic population _
10.4 million, up 36 percent in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Eh, Get a Horse
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough week for Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   The auto giant admitted it was aware of tire failures on
Explorer sport utility vehicles in Venezuela as early as 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge in Alameda County, Calif., Michael E.
Ballachey, largely agreed with complaints that Ford knowingly
installed defective ignition mechanisms in nearly two million Ford
vehicles produced from 1983 to 1995. The judge said he intended to
issue orders to recall and repair the vehicles. Analysts estimated
the cost could run as high as $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ford refuted the finding, and predicted it would be reversed on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A New Trial for American
</P>
<P>
   After an election marred by charges of voter fraud, President
Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru no doubt needs all the friends he can
get. That could well explain Peru's decision to grant a new trial
to Lori Berenson, the New Yorker who in 1996 was tried in secret
before masked judges and sentenced to life imprisonment for
terrorism. The case has been a thorn ever since in relations
between Washington and Lima, but human rights officials remained
wary, fearing that a new trial would be no fairer than the first.
</P>
<P>
   A Finding on Death Row  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not all Texas murder defendants get a decent courtroom defense.
Not in the case of Delma Banks Jr., who was sent to death row in
1980. His lawyer, a former district attorney, failed ``to
investigate or interview punishment-phase witnesses,'' a federal
magistrate later found. On Aug. 18, David Folsom, a U.S. District
judge in Texarkana, Texas, endorsed that finding, which was first
reported Wednesday in The Texarkana Gazette, and ordered either a
sentence reduction or new sentencing trial for Banks.

   The Good News About `Going Postal'
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20, 1986, an Oklahoma postal worker shot and killed 14
co-workers, then himself. In the years since, there have been other
incidents of violence and murder, sometimes multiple murder, by
current or former postal workers.
</P>
<P>
   On Aprril 17, 1994, in his ``On Language'' column in The New
York Times Magazine, William Safire discussed whether ``going
postal'' meant ``losing it'' or ``not being online.'' It was the
first time that ``going postal'' appeared in The Times.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is linguistic history. Three-year-olds know what going
postal means.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Postal Service happy about this? Not at all. So, calmly,
it commissioned a lengthy study on workplace safety, a study that _
with charts and myriad statistics _ strikes out at the notion that
your friendly letter carrier is likely, at any moment, to whip an
Uzi out of his mail pouch.
</P>
<P>
   ```Going postal' is a myth, a bad rap,'' the report says.
``Postal workers are no more likely to physically assault, sexually
harass, or verbally abuse their coworkers than employees in the
national workforce.'' Retail workers, it says, are eight times as
likely as postal workers to be victims of homicide at work.
</P>
<P>
   The study is a serious one. ``The level of violence throughout
the American workplace is unacceptably high,'' it says, and offers
a variety of remedies. But it also seems intent on clearing the
Postal Service's tainted name, noting that part of the problem is
that it has so many workers _ as a civilian employer, it's second
only to Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be rough. A new expression, once it has burst from
the starting gate, is awfully hard to call back. And ``going
Wal-Mart'' just doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   A Restaurant That's All Lobby
</P>
<P>
   Washington lobbyists, shod in tasseled loafers, once inspired
someone to describe their eager, sartorially enhanced gatherings
outside the closed doors of congressional hearing rooms as Gucci
Gulch. Now they have their own watering hole, the Caucus Room, and
the list of investors is top heavy with a who's who of lobbyocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it has more private dining rooms than any other
Washington restaurant. Thomas H. Boggs Jr., one of its largest
investors and one of the town's best-known lobbyists (his father,
Hale, was a Democratic leader in the the House, his mother, Lindy,
a former congresswoman from Louisiana and now ambassador to the
Vatican), provided a simple explanation. So many closed doors, he
said, make it possible to keep people like House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, a Republican, and Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, a
Democrat, from running into each other during fund-raising events.
Not so incidentally, lobbyists can deduct as much of their visits
as business expenses as possible _ 100 percent for a banquet, but
only 50 percent for a regular meal.
</P>
<P>
   The roster of the Caucus Room's 65 shareholders includes Michael
Brown, the son of the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, as well as
James Lake, the deputy campaign manager for the 1992 Bush campaign.
It practically guarantees a full house nightly. And if political
junkies watch the comings and goings of the private dining rooms
carefully, they might just be able to figure out the
behind-the-scene machinations that make Washington tick.
</P>
<P>
   In a town where politics has become a very nasty business, the
lobbyists have put aside their differences and come together in one
of their few bipartisan efforts, offering a culinary venue that
fairly sizzles with accommodation _ a steakhouse.

   As the soldiers raped and beat her in front of her two children,
a Bosnian refugee recalled, they taunted her, saying there was
nowhere she could turn for help.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a federal jury in New York awarded the woman and a
group of other refugees from the Balkans war $745 million in their
case against the former leader of Serbian forces in Bosnia, Dr.
Radovan Karadzic, charging him with masterminding a campaign of
genocide, rape and torture in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   That is just one of a series of recent cases in which American
courts have agreed to hear civil cases involving human rights
violations outside U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Center for Constitutional Rights _ a nonprofit
organization in Manhattan that successfully argued the first such
case more than 20 years ago _ served papers on Li Peng, the former
Chinese premier, who was staying at the Waldorf Towers in New York.
Jennifer M. Green, a lawyer with the center who is arguing the
case, said a group of Chinese students has filed suit in federal
court in New York against Li over the Chinese government's actions
during the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the U.S. courts' acceptance of human rights standards
are important steps forward in an international system in which
human rights violators can be held accountable,'' Green said. The
Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return calls requesting
comment last week.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, the Center for Constitutional Rights sued a government
official in Paraguay on behalf of a family who claimed their son
had been tortured there. The case, Filartiga vs. Pena, was a
landmark attempt to use American courts to judge a dispute that, on
its face, had nothing to do with the United States or its citizens.
To make the argument, Peter Weiss, the center's vice president,
turned to a 1787 law called the Alien Tort Claims Act, which
allowed foreigners to use U.S. courts to sue for violations of
international law.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the law after an attack on a French diplomat in
Philadelphia, said Anne-Marie Slaughter, a professor of
international law at Harvard who collaborated on a recent article
about the law for the journal Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was what was called a badge of honor,'' Slaughter said.
``We wanted to proclaim we were a member of the family of
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   At that time, international law consisted of conventions between
sovereign states, and covered issues like piracy and diplomatic
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Neuborne, a New York University law professor, views the
Nuremberg Tribunals that followed World War II as a turning point
for international law, because the Nuremburg judges found that even
though the Nazis had acted within their own legal framework, they
were not immune from prosecution under a more general law.
</P>
<P>
   ``International law involves individuals and not just
governments,'' Neuborne said. ``Human rights norms trump the rights
of dictators.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude underlies some international criminal cases, like
Spain's pursuit of the former Argentine strongman Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, and the indictments issued by the International War
Crimes Tribunal in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   And since the Filartiga case ended in 1980 _ with a judgment of
more than $10 million for the plaintiffs _ there has been a steady
increase in the number of civil cases brought in American courts by
foreign plaintiffs against foreign defendants, Slaughter said.
</P>
<P>
   Application of the Alien Tort Claims Act, and a handful of
similar laws, has extended beyond individual human cases to broader
areas of misconduct, she said, citing as examples claims against
corporations for environmental damage and for actions during the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Filartiga case and the Karadzic verdict, many such
cases bring huge monetary awards, but few plaintiffs ever collect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people engaged in this type of litigation would say the
power is the power of publicity and the very important symbolic
impact of allowing the victims to tell their story,'' Slaughter
said. ``If they do recover that would be great but that is not the
point of the litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few cases likely to result in money changing hands
was filed against Ferdinand Marcos, the former leader of the
Philippines. Robert Swift, who represented 9,539 people who sued
Marcos before his death in 1989, won a $2 billion judgment in
federal court in Hawaii in 1995. The plaintiffs settled with
Marcos' estate and with the Philippines' government for $161
million, Swift said. But he said the payment has been blocked by a
judge in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Swift said that while he recognized the political importance of
such civil cases, that was not his main motivation. ``My
involvement in this whole line of cases is to try to get
compensation for the victims,'' he said. ``I have never been
satisfied with a simple declaration that the abuse occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the largest settlements have involved the cases brought
in American courts by Holocaust survivors against banks and
corporations they accused of profiting from the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Although concerns have been raised that the success of the
Holocaust suits could lead to other _ less legitimate _ lawsuits,
representatives of the plaintiffs say it is an important step in
the recognition that certain rights do not stop at national
borders.

international law at Harvard who collaborated on a recent article
about the law for the journal Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was what was called a badge of honor,'' Slaughter said.
``We wanted to proclaim we were a member of the family of
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   At that time, international law consisted of conventions between
sovereign states, and covered issues like piracy and diplomatic
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Neuborne, a New York University law professor, views the
Nuremberg Tribunals that followed World War II as a turning point
for international law, because the Nuremburg judges found that even
though the Nazis had acted within their own legal framework, they
were not immune from prosecution under a more general law.
</P>
<P>
   ``International law involves individuals and not just
governments,'' Neuborne said. ``Human rights norms trump the rights
of dictators.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude underlies some international criminal cases, like
Spain's pursuit of the former Argentine strongman Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, and the indictments issued by the International War
Crimes Tribunal in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   And since the Filartiga case ended in 1980 _ with a judgment of
more than $10 million for the plaintiffs _ there has been a steady
increase in the number of civil cases brought in American courts by
foreign plaintiffs against foreign defendants, Slaughter said.
</P>
<P>
   Application of the Alien Tort Claims Act, and a handful of
similar laws, has extended beyond individual human cases to broader
areas of misconduct, she said, citing as examples claims against
corporations for environmental damage and for actions during the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Filartiga case and the Karadzic verdict, many such
cases bring huge monetary awards, but few plaintiffs ever collect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people engaged in this type of litigation would say the
power is the power of publicity and the very important symbolic
impact of allowing the victims to tell their story,'' Slaughter
said. ``If they do recover that would be great but that is not the
point of the litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few cases likely to result in money changing hands
was filed against Ferdinand Marcos, the former leader of the
Philippines. Robert Swift, who represented 9,539 people who sued
Marcos before his death in 1989, won a $2 billion judgment in
federal court in Hawaii in 1995. The plaintiffs settled with
Marcos' estate and with the Philippines' government for $161
million, Swift said. But he said the payment has been blocked by a
judge in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Swift said that while he recognized the political importance of
such civil cases, that was not his main motivation. ``My
involvement in this whole line of cases is to try to get
compensation for the victims,'' he said. ``I have never been
satisfied with a simple declaration that the abuse occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the largest settlements have involved the cases brought
in American courts by Holocaust survivors against banks and
corporations they accused of profiting from the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Although concerns have been raised that the success of the
Holocaust suits could lead to other _ less legitimate _ lawsuits,
representatives of the plaintiffs say it is an important step in
the recognition that certain rights do not stop at national
borders.

   Before the nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Memphis embarked
on a recent spy mission _ in which, Navy officials have said, it
captured the sounds of the explosions that helped sink Russia's
Kursk submarine last month _ one unsettling precaution was taken. A
bright orange rescue buoy, designed to shoot to the surface and
summon help if the Memphis got in trouble, was welded down and
rendered unusable.
</P>
<P>
   This was standard practice during the Cold War, when the Navy
feared that the inadvertent release of a buoy could tip off the
Russians to the presence of an American spy sub and set off an
underwater chase. It also reflected the grim acceptance among
submariners that if a serious accident occurred in hostile waters,
they probably were not coming back. But now that the two nations
are friendlier, times have changed. Or have they?
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk disaster, with the loss of all 118 men on board, has
cast a harsher light on the secrecy that has continued to define
submarine operations on both sides. It has also raised the question
of whether a little less cloak and dagger _ and more cooperation
among seafaring nations _ could go a long way toward improving the
safety of those on board the vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Old habits die hard. News reports in Russia last week suggested
that the Kursk might have been secretly testing a powerful new
torpedo when it sank in the Barents Sea on Aug. 12. That might help
explain why Russian leaders delayed seeking rescue assistance from
the West, even though a few crew members might have remained alive
for two or three days inside the wrecked hull.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities believe a torpedo accident caused two
explosions aboard the Kursk, with a huge blast from the torpedo's
warhead ripping a hole in the submarine. Pentagon officials said
last week that the Memphis and another U.S. submarine recorded the
explosions while secretly monitoring a Russian naval exercise.
</P>
<P>
   It is natural that the U.S. Navy wants to keep an eye on the
Russian navy. But the United States has sharply cut back the
frequency of surveillance missions since the end of the Cold War,
and the Russians rarely go to sea anymore. So, some critics ask,
why should U.S. submariners still be restricted in their ability to
seek help if a fire or flooding were to cripple their vessel?
</P>
<P>
   Submarine officers have said that if an accident occurred, they
would be much more willing to surface in international waters near
Russia than they used to be. U.S. subs also carry a tiny
communications buoy that can be ejected to transmit an SOS signal
for up to 18 hours. But even if they called for help, who would be
there to rescue them?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said it would have taken two or three days
for them to rush divers and rescue craft to the scene, or about the
same amount of time that it took the British and Norwegians to get
there.
</P>
<P>
   One solution would be for the world's leading submarine navies
to work together to build a new generation of rescue vessels and
position them around the globe. Some Western navies have already
modified their old rescue equipment to work with the U.S. gear.
Experts say Russia will need to cooperate more if such a rescue
network is going to work.

   NEW YORK _ Every Grand Slam awards a silver trophy and a hefty
pile of green to the player who wins seven straight matches over
the course of two grueling weeks. But in front of the television or
from the nosebleed seats, fans become armchair umpires of what's
really in and out. Their prize? Call it the Golden Hanger.
</P>
<P>
   It is only one week into the U.S. Open at the National Tennis
Center in Queens, but it's already game, set, match to Serena
Williams, at least in terms of the attention paid to her clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of Jerry Garcia clings to her chiseled body in the
form of an electric-purple tie-dyed frock that has eclipsed even
the red and yellow, thin-strapped numbers that turn her sister,
Venus, into a flash of lightning trailing a rush of flying limbs.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams has worn two variations on the mesh outfit thus
far, with sneakers to match, looking like an exuberant hostess
obviously pleased with her party dress. ``I think it is very
flattering,'' she said after her first-round victory.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans disagree on that point, but her attire demonstrates a
fashion reality: what is new is often borrowed from the past. ``I
just laugh when I see her, and everybody says she's the first to do
that,'' said Billie Jean King, a tennis pioneer who, like today's
players, knows that entertainment is as much a part of the game as
athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   When King won the ``Battle of the Sexes'' match against Bobby
Riggs in 1973, she wore royal blue shoes to match the pattern on
her white dress, created by the British-born designer Ted Tinling.
``I did it for color TV,'' King recalled. ``We didn't have color TV
very long then.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinling was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame for
his contributions to the evolution of women's outfits. He dressed
players as modern as Monica Seles and as historic as Suzanne
Lenglen (who had, in 1919, shocked Wimbledon by winning with her
stockings rolled down). At Wimbledon in 1949, he designed Gertrude
``Gussy'' Moran's lace panties, and photographers lined the court
for a glimpse.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to that, the much-ogled Anna Kournikova seems tame this
year, no longer baring her midriff, but wearing a sporty sleeveless
shirt and short shorts. (The Open has no restrictions on color, as
Wimbledon does, requiring mostly white clothing; by contract, women
must display their sponsor patch on their tops.)
</P>
<P>
   As Serena Williams' bold interpretation shows, women's outfits
have changed greatly since the red gingham jumper Tracy Austin wore
at the U.S. Open in 1977, which now looks like something out of the
musical ``Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Pierce loved many of Austin's dresses, and Chris Evert's,
too, which is why she agreed to incorporate the tennis dress into
her own wardrobe in the early 1990s when Nike suggested it. At this
U.S. Open, Pierce is back in a skirt, but she has earned points for
creativity with the ``elastophane'' straps on her light-blue
swirled top. They look like Scotch tape, but Pierce says they are
very comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort was the point in one of the game's first fashion
statements, made by a man who died a week ago at the age of 94,
Bunny Austin. In 1932, at a time when long flannel pants were de
rigueur on the courts, Austin arrived at the 1932 U.S.
Championships in shorts, his bare legs bristling before the genteel
spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Men's hemlines rose from there, going so short that when Stan
Smith won Wimbledon in 1972 in shorts that neared his knees, other
players commented. But after the short-short diehards Jimmy Connors
and Boris Becker retired, the shorts crept back down. Then they got
baggy, with Andre Agassi in denim and Pete Sampras apparently
dressing for a backyard barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Back when men's shorts were still rising, the shirt spectrum was
expanding. Starting in the late 1960s, John Newcombe, Tony Roche
and six other players known as the Handsome Eight were ordered to
wear bright-colored shirts to promote World Championship Tennis,
the fledgling professional tour. Pros like Stan Smith and Arthur
Ashe wore pastel.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the men's wardrobe _ like their tour, in fact _ is
not quite as dramatic as the women's. Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil
wears bright yellow and blue to honor the national colors of his
country, but he lost in the first round. The defending champion,
Agassi, who favors pale gray and white in his later years, lost
quietly in the second.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of show left, though, from the baseline to the
hemline. Even the fans who have already awarded the Golden Hanger
know they have yet to see the best of the crosscourt backhands and
rifled serves. Fans remember the champions for these images above
all.

MAKING A DENT IN THE DEMAND FOR ILLEGAL DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 (NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For international clients' use by

<P>
   When Andres Pastrana, the president of Colombia, said last week
that the key to winning the war against drugs was taming demand in
the United States, he ruffled some American feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was timing: President Clinton was about to
hand him a check for $1.3 billion in aid to train and outfit a new
Colombian anti-drug brigade. But Pastrana's words also rankled some
people because they took no account of the myriad demand-reduction
programs that are already in place in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the office of Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White
House drug czar, have a landslide of little-noted statistics that
show domestic demand for drugs has plunged. Use of cocaine, both
crack and powder, has decreased by 70 percent in the last 15 years,
said Bob Weiner, a spokesman for McCaffrey. Consumption of all
drugs by youths aged 12 to 17 went down 21 percent from 1997 to
1999, Weiner said. And while drug use went up among people 18 to
25, it was still far below what it had been 20 years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously have to do a better job of making certain that
Latin American nations, for one, understand that we have a strong
demand-reduction program in place and that it's working and
successful,'' Weiner said. The programs range from a national
campaign to put anti-drug commercials into movie theaters to having
federal agents talk in classrooms and office parks about the
dangers of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts are mirrored by a network of local programs around
the country. Many were modeled after those pioneered by the
Brooklyn district attorney's office. That office, which spends a
good deal of time making cases against dope dealers and crack
addicts, has in the last decade also focused on getting drug felons
into treatment programs, as well as educating the young about the
perils of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very clear that the problems Brooklyn was having when I
took over this office could not be addressed by law enforcement
alone and needed something other than a traditional approach,'' the
district attorney, Charles Hynes, said last week from San
Francisco, where he was speaking at a conference on drug treatment
programs. ``And if drugs were the operative reason for the crime
increase, then something had to be done about demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of his efforts is a program called D-TAP, or
Drug Treatment Alternative to Prison, which was the first of its
kind in the nation when it was introduced in 1990, the first year
of Hynes' tenure. Under the program, people convicted of
nonviolent, drug-related crimes may choose between going into
treatment or going to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DA said I'm going to take this population that would
otherwise end up in prison and divert them into treatment,'' said
Anne Swern, a deputy district attorney who runs D-TAP. ``If they
fail the program, they go to jail. But what we've found is that
D-TAP can deal with these people with risks to the public that are
low and benefits that are very high both financially and
recidivism-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Swern said about 50 percent of the people sent to prison in
Brooklyn for drug crimes since the program started were re-arrested
after three years, while only 23 percent of those who had entered
D-TAP were back before a judge over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The program has saved millions of dollars in taxpayer money,
too, Swern estimated. She said it cost $69,500 a year to house an
inmate with a drug habit on Riker's Island, the city's largest
jail. And it cost $82,000 a year, she said, to hold a criminal in
New York City before his trial and then imprison him in an upstate
cell. But to treat a convict for drug abuse, even in New York state
_ which has the highest such costs, she said _ takes between
$18,000 and $21,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes also requires every prosecutor in his office to spend at
least two days each month talking to students in more than 300
schools in Brooklyn about the consequences of using drugs. This
initiative, called Legal Lives, teaches children that there is a
price to pay for snorting cocaine or smoking pot by having them act
out situations they are certain to encounter on the street.
</P>
<P>
   In one script, ``Pot Luck,'' three youths are hanging out in the
schoolyard after class, and one pulls out a joint. They light up.
Then the cops arrive, and everyone is arrested. ``We stop the
action there and ask the kids questions,'' said Mary Hughes, who
runs the program. ``Why was Bob arrested? Why was Ernie arrested?
Did the police have a right to arrest them? Why? What choices did
everybody make?''
</P>
<P>
   So as it turns out, crime-busters, from Hynes' office to the
federal Drug Enforcement Administration, are, in fact, in agreement
with Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows the DEA as the guys who throw people in
jail,'' said Jack Hook, who runs the agency's demand-reduction
section. ``But the bottom line is that to solve the drug problem in
this country means education, prevention and treating those who are
already addicted.''

<P>
   When Andres Pastrana, the president of Colombia, said last week
that the key to winning the war against drugs was taming demand in
the United States, he ruffled some American feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was timing: President Clinton was about to
hand him a check for $1.3 billion in aid to train and outfit a new
Colombian anti-drug brigade. But Pastrana's words also rankled some
people because they took no account of the myriad demand-reduction
programs that are already in place in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the office of Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White
House drug czar, have a landslide of little-noted statistics that
show domestic demand for drugs has plunged. Use of cocaine, both
crack and powder, has decreased by 70 percent in the last 15 years,
said Bob Weiner, a spokesman for McCaffrey. Consumption of all
drugs by youths aged 12 to 17 went down 21 percent from 1997 to
1999, Weiner said. And while drug use went up among people 18 to
25, it was still far below what it had been 20 years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously have to do a better job of making certain that
Latin American nations, for one, understand that we have a strong
demand-reduction program in place and that it's working and
successful,'' Weiner said. The programs range from a national
campaign to put anti-drug commercials into movie theaters to having
federal agents talk in classrooms and office parks about the
dangers of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts are mirrored by a network of local programs around
the country. Many were modeled after those pioneered by the
Brooklyn district attorney's office. That office, which spends a
good deal of time making cases against dope dealers and crack
addicts, has in the last decade also focused on getting drug felons
into treatment programs, as well as educating the young about the
perils of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very clear that the problems Brooklyn was having when I
took over this office could not be addressed by law enforcement
alone and needed something other than a traditional approach,'' the
district attorney, Charles Hynes, said last week from San
Francisco, where he was speaking at a conference on drug treatment
programs. ``And if drugs were the operative reason for the crime
increase, then something had to be done about demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of his efforts is a program called D-TAP, or
Drug Treatment Alternative to Prison, which was the first of its
kind in the nation when it was introduced in 1990, the first year
of Hynes' tenure. Under the program, people convicted of
nonviolent, drug-related crimes may choose between going into
treatment or going to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DA said I'm going to take this population that would
otherwise end up in prison and divert them into treatment,'' said
Anne Swern, a deputy district attorney who runs D-TAP. ``If they
fail the program, they go to jail. But what we've found is that
D-TAP can deal with these people with risks to the public that are
low and benefits that are very high both financially and
recidivism-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Swern said about 50 percent of the people sent to prison in
Brooklyn for drug crimes since the program started were re-arrested
after three years, while only 23 percent of those who had entered
D-TAP were back before a judge over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The program has saved millions of dollars in taxpayer money,
too, Swern estimated. She said it cost $69,500 a year to house an

$18,000 and $21,000 a year.

WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT? LIEBERMAN AND THE RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Twelve years ago, lashing out at his opponent, Sen.
Lowell Weicker accused Joseph Lieberman of espousing the ``Jesse
Helms-Jerry Falwell-Pat Robertson platform'' by advocating a moment
of silence in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Was Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew and political moderate, somehow
aligned with a group Weicker characterized as the ``extreme right
wing''? Connecticut voters apparently ignored the charge, and a few
months later Lieberman was sitting in Weicker's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, many of those same religious conservatives
found themselves admiring Lieberman's advocacy of a spiritual
foundation to American public life, even as they wondered how he
got away with saying it. Now the Democratic vice-presidential
candidate, Lieberman has continued to espouse a greater role for
faith, but was rebuked by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith only when he suggested last Sunday that belief in God is the
basis of true morality. The group said such an appeal ``is contrary
to the American ideal.'' Lieberman later backed away from his
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christians from divergent political strata quickly came to
Lieberman's defense, saying they had been advocating the same
things for years yet they had been vilified. Forest Montgomery, of
the National Association of Evangelicals, said members of his group
were ``very comfortable with everything the senator's been
saying,'' even as they chafed at a double standard applied by the
news media. The Rev. Dr. Richard D. Land, president of the Southern
Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, said he was
delighted at Lieberman's stance, but added that if an evangelical
Christian had said the same things, he would have been accused of
promoting theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There remains, in the national media and many of the country's
elites, an extreme prejudice against evangelicals, who are seen as
threatening,'' said Land. ``But just as it took Nixon to go to
China, maybe it will require an Orthodox Jew to restore to its
rightful place the role of religion in this society. Because if it
desirable for an Orthodox Jew to say these things, it should
certainly be kosher for an evangelical or a Roman Catholic to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, Lieberman's message _ and his nature as a
messenger _ is substantially different from that of Christian
conservatives over the last 20 years. Evangelicals believe that
their mission is to spread the Gospel of Jesus to all nonbelievers;
the Southern Baptist Convention's Web site describes its ``strategy
for evangelizing the world'' by ``aggressively pursuing converts.''
As a Jew, without a sectarian mandate to proselytize, Lieberman
bears none of the baggage of the religious salesman, and is thus
more palatable to a wider public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since there's no fear that he will evangelize or poke into
your personal affairs, he sets up a perfectly designed
experiment,'' said Alan Wolfe, director of the Center for Religion
and American Public Life at Boston College. ``Now we'll be able to
see how much American unease there is about the subject, once they
don't have to worry about the intrusiveness of the messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a carefully calibrated blandness, too, about
Lieberman's presentation that is designed to appeal to a wide
audience. Many religious scholars say the senator's airy, almost
generic souffle of faith and policy recalls an older, nonsectarian
spiritual underpinning to government that has stronger roots than
the hard-edged prescriptions of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives have linked their beliefs to a set of
specific policies that do not always enjoy widespread support, such
as an opposition to abortion, a rejection of homosexuality or
support for school prayer. Lieberman says his support for
subsidizing medication for the elderly grows out of the Fifth
Commandment's insistence on respect for parents. But in general he
has not invoked faith to justify any measure that is considered
politically divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans like to have their politics informed by
morality, and their morality informed by religion, but they don't
believe religion should be used by politicians to justify a
particular piece of legislation,'' said Martin E. Marty, the
religion historian. ``Lieberman is very much in that mild tradition
of Dwight Eisenhower, trying not to disturb anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   In stressing the religious foundation of American society and
government, Lieberman is advocating what has been called the
country's ``civil religion,'' the spiritual but nonsectarian ties
that bind America's majority of believers, of whatever faith. The
term, which originated with Rousseau and was modernized by the
sociologist Robert N. Bellah in the 1960s, encompasses the basic
beliefs that led the Founders to proclaim that the Creator had
endowed man with certain ``inalienable rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the common stock of political thought in the 18th
century,'' said Bellah, co-author of ``Habits of the Heart''
(University of California Press, 1996) and a sociologist at the
University of California in Berkeley. ``As Tocqueville wrote, a
religious foundation was particularly necessary in a democratic
society, because it depends on the self-control of its citizens.
Without those inner guidelines, democracy would never have
worked.''
</P>
<P>
   But faith can be used to justify any number of political
positions, and over time, Americans have learned to be
uncomfortable with that. In the early years of this country,
ministers cited passages in the Bible to justify slavery. In the
20th century, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. grounded the
civil rights movement in the same document. Today, in South
Carolina, there are religious people on both sides of a proposed
state lottery for education that is on the ballot in November. Many
religious opponents of abortion believe Lieberman is a hypocrite
for advocating faith while supporting abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``His voting record on abortion is in direct contradiction to
the teaching of his faith,'' said Holly Gatling, executive director
of South Carolina Citizens for Life. ``Where is his faith when it
come to the unborn?'' Lieberman has said that Orthodox Judaism
considers abortion to be a personal matter, although many Orthodox
Jews disagree.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those unhappy with the senator's votes are still
pleased that he has cast them in moral terms, convinced that he has
now opened the doors for others to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say the Lord says we should vote a certain way is a
debasement of religion that verges on sacrilege,'' said the Rev.
Richard John Neuhaus, a Catholic priest who is editor of First
Things, a conservative religious journal. ``But there's nothing
wrong with making policy proposals in frankly moral terms, which
used to be the norm in this society. The only thing strange about
what Lieberman is saying is that people think it's strange.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the labor movement, Public Enemy No. 1 has long been the
nation's growing income gap. John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO
president, frequently complains in speeches that the economic boom
under President Clinton has left millions of hard-working Americans
behind and that corporate chieftains have rewarded themselves
richly while downsizing their work forces and clamping down on
wages.
</P>
<P>
   To fan the flames of blue-collar and white-collar discontent,
the labor federation has set up a Web site (www.paywatch.org) that
shows workers how many hundreds of times more the CEOs at their
companies earn than they do.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes Vice President Al Gore, who has borrowed much of
labor's class-edged, us-against-them rhetoric, with an eye to
making America's steel-mill workers and truck drivers feel
enthusiastic about his candidacy. Gore rails against the powerful
and declares himself the champion of working families. Intending to
please the have-nots and the have-littles, Gore says he will oppose
``a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else.''
In his embrace of labor, Gore plans to speak alongside Sweeney in
Pittsburgh on Monday, Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   But while co-opting some AFL-CIO rhetoric (Sweeney's favorite
phrase is ``working families''), Gore steers clear of the income
gap, which only widened on his and Clinton's watch.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration points to statistics showing
that the gap has grown far more slowly than under Presidents Ronald
Reagan and George Bush, recent trends are still daunting. Last
year, it took 100 million of the lowest earning Americans to equal
the after-tax dollars of the top 1 percent. In 1977, it only took
49 million of the lowest earners to equal the top 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another politically embarrassing nugget: the bottom four-fifths
of households _ numbering 217 million _ took a thinner slice of the
nation's economic pie last year, 50 percent, than in 1977, when it
was 56 percent. One reason, according to data from the
Congressional Budget Office, was that nine-tenths of the growth in
the economic pie since then went to the richest 1 percent of
households, which last year averaged $515,600 in after-tax income,
up from $234,700 in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   With the campaign heating up, labor leaders have been bringing
up the income gap less frequently, partly because focusing on it
might embarrass their preferred candidate. In an interview, Sweeney
said that he had not forgotten the issue, but that many of the
forces spurring the gap were largely beyond the control of the
Democratic administration. For instance, rapid technological change
and the decline in manufacturing have wiped out millions of
unskilled jobs and have thus held down wages for many low-wage
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney praised the Clinton-Gore team for pressing for
legislation that would reduce the income gap, both pre-tax and
after-tax. He cited the administration's push for a higher minimum
wage, more money for job training and billions of dollars for an
expanded Earned Income Tax Credit.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO president added that he expected the Republican
presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, to do considerably less
than Gore to help middle-income and low-income Americans. Bush has
repeatedly asserted that his proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut will do
far more for the middle class than Gore's proposal for a smaller,
focused tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Bush campaigned with a $40,000-a-year teacher and high
school coach from Louisiana, Andrew Beechac, who hailed Bush's tax
proposal, saying: ``We all want tax relief, especially for my
family and for middle America around the country. We really need
this plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Garin, a pollster who often advises the AFL-CIO,
predicted that workers concerned about the income gap would be
unlikely to favor Bush. ``The concern about Bush among AFL-CIO
members,'' he said, ``is that he will be a rich man's president and
will have the kinds of policies that are designed to let the
well-to-do have all the benefits of the economy. And they think
Gore will be much more likely to spread the benefits around.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that Bush's policies would widen the gap, labor
leaders point to his proposal to allow individual states to opt out
of any increase in the minimum wage beyond the current $5.15 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Some unions _ most notably the Teamsters, one of the few not to
endorse Gore _ are not willing to give the vice president a pass on
the swelling income gap. For these unions, globalization and freer
trade are among the biggest factors behind the widening gap. James
P. Hoffa, the Teamsters' president, has often argued that trade
liberalization measures, like the administration-backed China trade
bill, encourage a flood of imports from low-wage countries and an
exodus of American jobs. These developments, Hoffa said, and many
free-trade economists acknowledge, help hold down blue-collar wages
and thereby worsen the income gap.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney has sought to convince the Teamsters that the best way
to reduce income disparities is to elect a Democrat. ``Many of the
initiatives the administration has taken to spread the wealth more
fairly, like increasing the minimum wage, have consistently been
blocked by the Republican leadership in the Congress,'' he said.

<P>
   For the labor movement, Public Enemy No. 1 has long been the
nation's growing income gap. John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO
president, frequently complains in speeches that the economic boom
under President Clinton has left millions of hard-working Americans
behind and that corporate chieftains have rewarded themselves
richly while downsizing their work forces and clamping down on
wages.
</P>
<P>
   To fan the flames of blue-collar and white-collar discontent,
the labor federation has set up a Web site (www.paywatch.org) that
shows workers how many hundreds of times more the CEOs at their
companies earn than they do.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes Vice President Al Gore, who has borrowed much of
labor's class-edged, us-against-them rhetoric, with an eye to
making America's steel-mill workers and truck drivers feel
enthusiastic about his candidacy. Gore rails against the powerful
and declares himself the champion of working families. Intending to
please the have-nots and the have-littles, Gore says he will oppose
``a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else.''
In his embrace of labor, Gore plans to speak alongside Sweeney in
Pittsburgh on Monday, Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   But while co-opting some AFL-CIO rhetoric (Sweeney's favorite
phrase is ``working families''), Gore steers clear of the income
gap, which only widened on his and Clinton's watch.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration points to statistics showing
that the gap has grown far more slowly than under Presidents Ronald
Reagan and George Bush, recent trends are still daunting. Last
year, it took 100 million of the lowest earning Americans to equal
the after-tax dollars of the top 1 percent. In 1977, it only took
49 million of the lowest earners to equal the top 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another politically embarrassing nugget: the bottom four-fifths
of households _ numbering 217 million _ took a thinner slice of the
nation's economic pie last year, 50 percent, than in 1977, when it
was 56 percent. One reason, according to data from the
Congressional Budget Office, was that nine-tenths of the growth in
the economic pie since then went to the richest 1 percent of
households, which last year averaged $515,600 in after-tax income,
up from $234,700 in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   With the campaign heating up, labor leaders have been bringing
up the income gap less frequently, partly because focusing on it
might embarrass their preferred candidate. In an interview, Sweeney
said that he had not forgotten the issue, but that many of the
forces spurring the gap were largely beyond the control of the
Democratic administration. For instance, rapid technological change
and the decline in manufacturing have wiped out millions of
unskilled jobs and have thus held down wages for many low-wage
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney praised the Clinton-Gore team for pressing for
legislation that would reduce the income gap, both pre-tax and
after-tax. He cited the administration's push for a higher minimum
wage, more money for job training and billions of dollars for an
expanded Earned Income Tax Credit.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO president added that he expected the Republican
presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, to do considerably less
than Gore to help middle-income and low-income Americans. Bush has
repeatedly asserted that his proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut will do
far more for the middle class than Gore's proposal for a smaller,
focused tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Bush campaigned with a $40,000-a-year teacher and high
school coach from Louisiana, Andrew Beechac, who hailed Bush's tax
proposal, saying: ``We all want tax relief, especially for my
family and for middle America around the country. We really need
this plan.''
</P>

   WASHINGTON _ The only president whose wild mood swings prompted
his own secretary of defense to issue orders designed to block him
if he called out the Marines for protection against impeachment is
also the only president known to have been treated by a
psychotherapist.
</P>
<P>
   That president was Richard M. Nixon, and both of those
experiences are chronicled in ``The Arrogance of Power: The Secret
World of Richard Nixon,'' by Anthony Summers (Viking). And while
other accounts in his book, including episodes of wife-beating and
pill-popping, are angrily contradicted by Nixon's defenders, the
revelations about the secret order and the president's psychiatric
treatment have not been widely disputed.
</P>
<P>
   But they raise important questions. While the physical health of
presidents and politicians has become a fit topic for public
discussion, the overwhelming majority of politicians still hide
their mental difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is purely anecdotal, but talking to psychiatrists
in Washington, it is clear that while there have been some changes
since Nixon's time (when his therapist, Dr. Arnold A. Hutschnecker,
visited the White House rarely and used false destinations when he
signed in), they have largely been around the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fred Solomon, a practicing psychiatrist here since the early
1960s, said, ``I don't think the politicians are any more eager,
more relaxed than they used to be about therapy for themselves.''
But, he said, they are ``a lot more willing to have family members
get help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The recognition of usefulness for psychiatric care for family
members is just moving along just fine,'' he continued. ``Marital
counseling is sought by a number of people, and there is
recognition in general that mental health problems can be just as
disabling as physical health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who has crusaded for legislation
to force insurance companies to treat mental health the same as
physical health, recalled a meeting at Vice President Al Gore's
house a few years ago about a proposed bill. More than 30 senators
were there, most with their spouses. They spoke ``very personally
about members of their own family or close friends who struggled
with mental illness, but not to the point of talking about
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists here say they understand why politicians fear
disclosure. Dr. Dorothy Starr said, ``I think there remains a good
deal of uncertainty in the public mind about people who have been
mentally ill.'' Another psychiatrist, Dr. Harvey Rich, said, ``We
hold our politicians up to a different kind of standard _ you can't
have a weakness of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, who was a Seattle psychiatrist before coming
to Congress and who has referred other members of Congress to
psychiatrists, said the fear of being found out discouraged others
who talked to him about getting help.
</P>
<P>
   But the experiences of those politicians who have publicly
acknowledged mental illness _ in each case treatment for depression
_ raise questions about that widespread fear. Sen. Thomas Eagleton,
who was dropped as a vice-presidential candidate in George
McGovern's campaign in 1972 after failing to disclose electroshock
treatments for depression, was re-elected to the Senate in Missouri
in 1974 and 1980. Lawton Chiles, who left the Senate in 1989,
recovered from depression and was twice elected governor of
Florida. And three current members of the House _ Reps. Lynn Rivers
of Michigan, Nydia Velazquez of New York and Patrick Kennedy of
Rhode Island _ have survived such disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a high-profile campaign tried to damage an
opponent by accusing him of seeking psychiatric help was in 1988,
when George Bush's presidential campaign and President Ronald
Reagan sought to discredit Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic
nominee. John Deardourff, a longtime Republican consultant, said he
believed that ``there are enough people in both parties'' today
``who would speak out against anybody who tried to raise that issue
against a candidate that it would be very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster, said it could make a
difference what office a politician was seeking. For a
congressional candidate, he said, the examples of entertainment and
sports figures suggested disclosure was safe, phrased in terms of
``Here's a challenge that I faced.''
</P>
<P>
   But a candidate for president, he said, ``faces a tougher
barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Deardourff agreed, saying the public understands that the
presidency is an ``intensely demanding job demanding mental
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fred Goodwin, a former head of the National Institute of
Mental Health, said it was important to distinguish between
different sorts of mental illness _ a treatable depression is one
thing and schizophrenia another. ``I don't think the public
concerns are entirely unfounded,'' Goodwin said. ``When we fight
stigma, we shouldn't pretend that mental illnesses are just the
same as physical illness. If you're talking about a disorder that
affects thinking, behavior, that's different from high blood
pressure or diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the public is uneasy about something, their views may be
exaggerated, there may be a lot of irrationality, a lot of fear.
But when it's pervasive and hangs around, the public is at least
partially on to something.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon pointed out that some politicians, like President
Clinton, publicly engage in spiritual counseling while rejecting
psychiatric help. And even those who discuss mental illness often
do so using murky terminology. ``They also pick their words very
carefully, like `counseling,' not `therapy,''' he said. ``They get
medication from their internal medicine doctors, like Vince Foster
did, but didn't really want to see a psychiatrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Tipper Gore, praised by one psychiatrist after another for
discussing her depression and treatment last year, spoke of
``counseling.'' And when an article in The New York Times Magazine
in 1993 described the family therapy received by the Gores after
their son was struck by a car and nearly died, the vice president's
office complained that the article should not have said he had
weekly visits from a ``therapist,'' but from a ``facilitator.''

<P>
   PARIS _ Many passengers flying out of Africa are familiar with
the ritual: the doors close and the flight attendants ask those
wearing contact lenses to shut their eyes. Some passengers pull
blankets over their heads. Then they pop the tops on two cans of a
sickly sweet aerosol and walk quickly down the aisles, a white
cloud billowing behind them which the air-conditioning quickly
dissipates.
</P>
<P>
   This is mosquito control at the nexus between the poor, infected
world and the rich, scared one. The spray is meant to kill any bugs
that slipped in while the doors were open; a long-lasting fumigant
is used in the luggage hold.
</P>
<P>
   There are 3,500 species of mosquitoes in this world. Luckily for
mankind, only a few relish human blood. No one knows how many germs
and worms _ from viruses to bacteria to parasites _ are loose in
the bloodstreams of other animals, but it's even luckier that only
a few can survive back-to-back assaults by the mosquito digestive
system and the human immune system and emerge as an illness.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York area, the arrival of the West Nile virus last
year brought home just how unpleasant an unlucky series of
coincidences can be when the right mosquito for the job is around;
of the 62 cases last year, seven were fatal. Seven cases have been
reported this year.
</P>
<P>
   If the indestructible cockroach is the Sherman tank of the
insect kingdom, the fragile mosquito is its DC-7, a pioneer in
linking the world by air. Most mosquitoes don't fly five miles in
their lives, but a few have joined the jet age. Just last month the
World Health Organization in Geneva issued a warning about
``airport malaria.''
</P>
<P>
   France leads the world, with 26 cases since 1970, a few of them
fatal, among people who had never visited a malarious country but
who lived near airports or worked at them. They were probably
bitten by stowaways disembarking from flights from West Africa. In
a 1994 outbreak, epidemiologists counted six malaria cases in three
weeks near Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport, and calculated that 8
to 20 anopheles mosquitoes had been on each of 300 arriving
flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the dangers of globalization,'' said Dr. David L.
Heymann, director for communicable diseases at the World Health
Organization, although he was quick to point out that humans carry
disease around the globe more effectively than mosquitoes do.
</P>
<P>
   To stop mosquitoes, European nations have stepped up their
spraying of airplanes; U.S. carriers hesitate, public health
experts say, even on obviously dicey routes like some Caribbean
flights because of fears of litigation from passengers claiming
reactions to the aerosols, which the WHO considers safe.
</P>
<P>
   Countries in northern climes have built-in barriers. As the old
medical adage goes, ``The world's best public health policy is
winter.'' And until a cold snap arrives, rich nations have
protection that citizens of poor tropical nations often cannot
afford: air-conditioners, window screens, window glass and bug
repellent.
</P>
<P>
   What poor nations have are trucks puffing out pesticide _
something New Yorkers are now enduring as West Nile reaches Central
Park. Poor nations also still spray DDT on inside walls because it
is cheap, persistent and lethal. If the United States is not
careful, the use of that old resource, now banned, could return,
too. Americans forget that yellow fever was once endemic in the
country and that mosquito species capable of spreading malaria are
found as far north as Boston in summertime.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquito hitchhikers predate not only the jet age but the steam
age. The African species Aedes aegypti, an avid man-eater with the
power to carry both yellow and dengue fever, probably reached South
America in slave ships. ``The eggs lived in the water containers
and the live ones fed on the populations on board,'' said Michael
Nathan, an entomologist with the WHO. ``A lot of slaves and a lot
of crews died of yellow fever on the way over.''
</P>
<P>
   Global commerce has sped up species transfers. Used tires sent
for retreading are thought to be the vehicle for Aedes albopictus,
the aggressive ``tiger mosquito'' that reached the United States
from southeast Asia 20 years ago and is found as far north as
Minnesota. It does not usually carry fatal diseases in the United
States, but can.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria is the riskiest candidate, but not the only one. Besides
West Nile virus and its St. Louis and Japanese relatives, yellow
fever, dengue fever and elephantiasis can all be injected by
mosquito saliva.
</P>

<P>
   PARIS _ Many passengers flying out of Africa are familiar with
the ritual: the doors close and the flight attendants ask those
wearing contact lenses to shut their eyes. Some passengers pull
blankets over their heads. Then they pop the tops on two cans of a
sickly sweet aerosol and walk quickly down the aisles, a white
cloud billowing behind them which the air-conditioning quickly
dissipates.
</P>
<P>
   This is mosquito control at the nexus between the poor, infected
world and the rich, scared one. The spray is meant to kill any bugs
that slipped in while the doors were open; a long-lasting fumigant
is used in the luggage hold.
</P>
<P>
   There are 3,500 species of mosquitoes in this world. Luckily for
mankind, only a few relish human blood. No one knows how many germs
and worms _ from viruses to bacteria to parasites _ are loose in
the bloodstreams of other animals, but it's even luckier that only
a few can survive back-to-back assaults by the mosquito digestive
system and the human immune system and emerge as an illness.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York area, the arrival of the West Nile virus last
year brought home just how unpleasant an unlucky series of
coincidences can be when the right mosquito for the job is around;
of the 62 cases last year, seven were fatal. Seven cases have been
reported this year.
</P>
<P>
   If the indestructible cockroach is the Sherman tank of the
insect kingdom, the fragile mosquito is its DC-7, a pioneer in
linking the world by air. Most mosquitoes don't fly five miles in
their lives, but a few have joined the jet age. Just last month the
World Health Organization in Geneva issued a warning about
``airport malaria.''
</P>
<P>
   France leads the world, with 26 cases since 1970, a few of them
fatal, among people who had never visited a malarious country but
who lived near airports or worked at them. They were probably
bitten by stowaways disembarking from flights from West Africa. In
a 1994 outbreak, epidemiologists counted six malaria cases in three
weeks near Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport, and calculated that 8
to 20 anopheles mosquitoes had been on each of 300 arriving
flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the dangers of globalization,'' said Dr. David L.
Heymann, director for communicable diseases at the World Health
Organization, although he was quick to point out that humans carry
disease around the globe more effectively than mosquitoes do.
</P>
<P>
   To stop mosquitoes, European nations have stepped up their
spraying of airplanes; U.S. carriers hesitate, public health
experts say, even on obviously dicey routes like some Caribbean
flights because of fears of litigation from passengers claiming
reactions to the aerosols, which the WHO considers safe.
</P>
<P>
   Countries in northern climes have built-in barriers. As the old
medical adage goes, ``The world's best public health policy is
winter.'' And until a cold snap arrives, rich nations have
protection that citizens of poor tropical nations often cannot
afford: air-conditioners, window screens, window glass and bug
repellent.
</P>
<P>
   What poor nations have are trucks puffing out pesticide _
something New Yorkers are now enduring as West Nile reaches Central
Park. Poor nations also still spray DDT on inside walls because it
is cheap, persistent and lethal. If the United States is not
careful, the use of that old resource, now banned, could return,
too. Americans forget that yellow fever was once endemic in the
country and that mosquito species capable of spreading malaria are
found as far north as Boston in summertime.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquito hitchhikers predate not only the jet age but the steam
age. The African species Aedes aegypti, an avid man-eater with the
power to carry both yellow and dengue fever, probably reached South
America in slave ships. ``The eggs lived in the water containers
and the live ones fed on the populations on board,'' said Michael
Nathan, an entomologist with the WHO. ``A lot of slaves and a lot
of crews died of yellow fever on the way over.''
</P>
<P>
   Global commerce has sped up species transfers. Used tires sent
for retreading are thought to be the vehicle for Aedes albopictus,
the aggressive ``tiger mosquito'' that reached the United States
from southeast Asia 20 years ago and is found as far north as
Minnesota. It does not usually carry fatal diseases in the United
States, but can.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria is the riskiest candidate, but not the only one. Besides
West Nile virus and its St. Louis and Japanese relatives, yellow
fever, dengue fever and elephantiasis can all be injected by
mosquito saliva.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes are easy to hate, but there is no public health value
in blaming them alone, particularly for West Nile. Since it
survives in birds, West Nile could have entered in imported birds.
Or in a gull blown far off course or, conceivably, one who shared a
tick with a bird from Africa or the Middle East while both were
summering near the Arctic Circle.
</P>

<P>
   The abrupt turnaround in the public image of Dr. Wen Ho Lee from
villain to victim, from atomic spy endangering the nation's
security to computer nerd unfairly put behind bars for downloading
harmless minutia, is raising new questions about what constitutes a
nuclear secret these days. More than half a century after the
making of the atom bomb, millions of former secrets have been
either declassified or posted willy-nilly on Internet sites, even
as the nuclear club has grown to at least eight members, with many
more wanabees in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with President Clinton's announcement on Friday that he
would leave the decision on whether to pursue a national missile
defense system to his successor _ a shield that China, Russia and
the NATO allies have warned may set off another nuclear arms race _
Lee's case raises a troubling question: what's really secret
anymore?
</P>
<P>
   The surprising answer is, a lot. Some restricted data is deemed
so sensitive that Washington is engaged in a quiet effort to raise
classifications from secret to top secret for 65 nuclear topics,
making whole libraries of sequestered data less likely to slip into
foreign hands.
</P>
<P>
   Though itself off limits, the list of high-risk topics, experts
say, includes information that would let outsiders foil U.S.
weapons, fire stolen arms, copy American bomb designs and
manufacture nuclear weapons small enough to fit atop long-range
missiles or into a terrorist's briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   Even the stack of blueprints for Little Boy, the atomic bomb
dropped on Hiroshima _ an extremely crude device by today's
standards _ is now proposed to be made top secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to restore people's respect for classified
information,'' said Dr. Albert Narath, a former director of the
Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M. The problem, he
added, is that Washington has such a ``long history of classifying
too much stuff that people have lost respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Lee, 60, a Taiwan-born naturalized citizen who was
fired last year from the Los Alamos National Laboratory amid a spy
inquiry, is a worrisome example of just how bewildering the
nation's nuclear secrets policy has become.
</P>
<P>
   After he was arrested in December, the government asserted that
Lee was dangerous because the computer files he downloaded
illegally to an unsecure computer were the ``crown jewels'' of the
nuclear arsenal. Some of his portable computer tapes are missing,
and the government argued that Lee, if freed on bail, might give
secrets to China or other nations.
</P>
<P>
   But his defense team later showed that the data Lee downloaded
was classified as secret and confidential only after his dismissal
from Los Alamos. And last month, a defense witness, John L.
Richter, a former top nuclear weapons designer at Los Alamos,
testified that perhaps 99 percent of the downloaded information had
already been made public and would not be that useful to a foreign
country.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if national security would be hurt if the missing tapes
found their way into foreign hands, Richter replied, ``I don't
believe that it would have any deleterious effect at all.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, after that testimony, a federal judge reversed
himself and said Lee could be released on bail after eight months
in jail, though on Friday prosecutors won an appeal that delayed a
final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's guilt or innocence has yet to be determined. But Richter's
assertion has fed the growing perception that many, if not all,
nuclear secrets are out of the bag _ a view based partly on fact.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of memoirs and histories, and the fact that scientists
talk for a living, have unveiled most basic principles. It is well
known, for instance, how the high heat of a small atomic explosion
in a thermonuclear weapon ignites hydrogen fuel in a far more
powerful blast.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the dribble of official declassifications during
the Cold War later turned into a flood. Private experts who have
tapped this gusher include Chuck Hansen, the author of ``The Swords
of Armageddon,'' a CD-ROM containing 2,503 pages and 345 diagrams
that is a near-encyclopedia of what is known publicly about
America's efforts to make nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington in recent years, the push for greater openness has
coexisted uneasily with an equally intense desire to raise a wall
around the nation's remaining nuclear secrets. That tension began
with Hazel O'Leary, who as head of the Department of Energy from
1993 to 1997 was the main keeper of the nation's atomic secrets.
Her pursuit of openness was widely praised and condemned, but
behind the scenes she also promoted a secrecy drive known as
``Higher Fences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People think Hazel was declassifying promiscuously,'' said
Steven Aftergood, a secrecy expert at the Federation of American
Scientists, a private group in Washington. ``In fact, she was
trying to bring order and logic to the classification process.''
</P>
<P>
   The rationale was that the bag of atomic secrets had grown so
large that protection would be ensured only if the most serious
topics were set aside for stringent safeguarding. So it was that,
long before the Lee case made Washington hypersensitive about lax
security, a push was underway to put key nuclear secrets under
tighter lock.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 report, the National Academy of Sciences blessed the
general idea. In 1997, Narath of Sandia led a Energy Department
panel that called for 137 topics to be raised from secret to top
secret classification, which would increase protections and sharply
cut access. But the Defense Department, which deploys the nuclear
arms made and maintained by the Energy Department, balked, citing
the added cost of building new storage facilities, computer
networks and specialist cadres. Defense Department officials also
expressed an unwillingness to shoulder the added costs of providing
top secret clearances. The price of a federal investigation for a
secret clearance is about $100, experts say, whereas a top secret
clearance runs about $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to ease the load, the Energy Department then winnowed the
list of proposed top-secret topics to 65, officials said. Still,
nothing happened. Recently, the deadlock ended after Congress shook
things up. Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr., R-Va., chairman of the House
Commerce Committee, asked Defense Secretary William S. Cohen in a
Aug. 14 letter to explain why his agency had apparently failed to
make ``an adequate effort'' to review the Energy Department's
revised plan or boost security.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, the two feuding agencies signed a agreement to make
joint recommendations by Dec. 1, and perhaps to help end the false
impression of a nuclear sieve created by the Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   Will the new study end in another standoff between the
bureaucracies? ``I don't engage in dry holes,'' said Eugene E.
Habiger, head of security at the Energy Department. ``I engage in
making things happen.''

<P>
   TOLEDO, Ohio _ Labor Day is the unofficial opening of the
general election campaign, but for most voters the race is already
over. Strategists on both sides agree that more than 90 percent of
the electorate has by now settled on either Gov. George W. Bush or
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the outcome in November hinging on a sliver of
expected voters _ fewer than 10 percent _ who truly have not made
up their minds. This narrow pool of voters reflects what pollsters
say has been an appreciable shift in the electorate in the two
weeks since the Democratic convention: Gore consolidated the base
vote in his party, something Bush accomplished weeks, if not
months, earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides will still strive to ensure the highest possible
turnout from their most faithful partisans. But the campaigns are
now devoting their two most precious commodities _ time and money _
in the remaining two months to persuading up-in-the-air voters to
side with them.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 148 million registered voters, 103 million are expected
to vote. Of those, an estimated 5 million are undecided. But if
this pool is further narrowed to include undecided voters in
important battleground states, the actual number of voters that
both camps _ and to a lesser degree the third-party contenders _
are fighting over may be fewer than 1 million. That is minuscule,
especially when contrasted with a voting-age population of more
than 205 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the gold,'' said John Zogby, a pollster who is not
affiliated with either party. ``Kind of sobering, isn't it?
Three-quarters of a million to a million voters in 10 states.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition over these swing voters is driving the political
calculations of each side. It explains why Bush traveled to Ohio
Thursday to visit a high school _ his 100th school visit _ and in
fact spent all week promoting his education plan. It also explains
the Gore campaign's decision to celebrate the Labor Day weekend
with a 24-hour ``American Workathon,'' for which the vice president
will travel to five cities to spend time with people who are
working.
</P>
<P>
   The push and pull over swing voters is particularly intense and
of utmost consequence this year because both sides acknowledge that
the electoral dynamic has changed significantly, with polls now
showing a dead-even race between Gore and Bush. For months leading
to the party conventions, Bush clung to a small but unmistakable
lead. In some current polls, Gore has even pulled ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gore's aides, citing private and public polls in several
states, are confidently declaring for the first time that they are
leading in the Electoral College tally. ``We're ahead
substantially,'' said Tad Devine, a top strategist for Gore. ``I've
been surprised at the depth of the movement to Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, the architect of the Bush strategy, conceded that
Gore had made inroads. Yet Rove disputed the surveys cited by the
Gore camp and insisted that the Texas governor was still dominant
in the Electoral College. But, sounding a bit frustrated by
questions about his candidate's potency in the polls, Rove added:
``Tune in, man. We've been saying for about three weeks that the
race will essentially be dead even by Labor Day. Welcome to
reality!''
</P>
<P>
   While the undecided voters are not a monolith, surveys show that
they do share some characteristics: More than half consider
themselves independents. They are mostly married, between the ages
of 45 and 64. They hold moderate stands on issues. They voted
overwhelmingly for President Clinton's re-election. They are
generally from working-class families in which both parents work
and the income is between $30,000 and $50,000. Many live in suburbs
in the Midwest, and some in rural areas. More than half are women.
</P>
<P>
   One swing voter is Francis Steffee, 76, a retired food services
worker in Kent, Ohio. ``This one is hard to figure out,'' she said.
``One day I'm leaning for one, and the next day, well, I'm leaning
for the other. I thought I'd wait until they have the debates and
see what goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Whom does she favor today? ``I'm thinking of Gore,'' she said,
explaining that she was put off by Bush's promises about improving
education. ``Everybody says they're going to do this and do that.
You know it never happens that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Arland Van Kirk, 68, a retired worker in a carburetor shop in
Lock Haven, Pa., also has not decided. She identifies more with
Republicans than Democrats, she said, but voted for Clinton twice _
and is torn between Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are both trying too hard,'' Van Kirk said. ``If
they'd just give a straight answer on the tough questions, without
all the hemming and hawing.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining that she was not inclined to back Bush, she said: ``I
never liked Bush the father. I always thought he was too
mealy-mouthed.'' Her problem with Gore was also one of style. ``He
sometimes acts like he's Mr. Big,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gore and Bush battle over these voters, the candidates'
target audiences are slightly different. Strategists on each side
said that among undecided voters, Bush was aiming at a younger,
slightly more upscale pool by promoting measures like privatizing
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is struggling to hold on to a chunk of female voters in
that swing group who polls show are slipping back to the Democratic
fold. That, his advisers said, was the impetus behind his visits to
schools because women are particularly supportive of improving
schools.
</P>
<P>
   With his emphasis on prescription drugs and protecting Medicare,
Gore is fashioning his appeals for slightly older swing voters who
are faring adequately economically but not as well as they would
like. Although his campaign has had far more success with women
than men, Gore is trying to eat into the support for Bush among
working-class men.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has been more aggressive than the Gore
operation in homing in on those swing voters.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   That relentless focus was on display last week in the
northwestern corner of Ohio, a crucial battleground state. After
Bush's plane landed at the Toledo airport, one of his aides told
reporters that the media market here had the fourth-largest number
of swing voters in the state.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident that when he arrived, Bush was greeted by
what he called ``a real family of four,'' with an annual income of
$50,000, that he said would benefit from his tax cut plan. And it
was no accident that on his one stop in Ohio, Bush headed for
Springfield High School in Holland to promote himself as the
candidate most dedicated to improving education.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign could afford to be more narrow in aiming at
swing voters, Rove explained, because Republicans rallied behind
Bush faster than Democrats did behind Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elections are won by doing two things: mobilizing your base
and winning the independent swing voters,'' Rove said. ``Our base
is mobilized and we're winning independent voters. It's just a
question of grinding it out, keeping a focus on the agenda, on your
issues _ and pushing it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Devine acknowledged that his campaign has been less surgical in
pursuing swing voters. He said that was not because the campaign
was still trying to woo core supporters but because at this point
``it would be a mistake for us to limit the target audience too
narrowly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're casting a pretty wide net,'' he said. ``We're not into
laser surgery here. It's not like a piece of direct mail that will
land in the last two weeks of the election. We're still very much
in a very broad, thematic, formative stage of the election.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush was in Ohio on Thursday, Gore was stumping in Seattle
with a message of his own for the undecided. Rather than
specifically refer to a family with the demographics he is seeking
to reach _ as did Bush _ Gore broadly appealed to voters who
acknowledge the nation's prosperity but worry that they have not
benefited sufficiently from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to fight to make sure that everybody participates in
the prosperity,'' Gore said at an outdoor rally in downtown
Seattle, ``that nobody is left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That Bush and Gore are competing over slightly different
profiles of swing voters is apparent in their television
commercials. Since the Democratic convention, advertising by the
Bush campaign and the Republican Party has included images of 40
children or young adults, 18 adults and 15 elderly people,
according to an examination by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the
Annenberg School of Communication at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in keeping with Gore's focus on older voters,
Jamieson found that the Gore and Democratic Party advertisements in
that same period featured 23 children or young adults, but 56
adults and 25 elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Given that most voters have made up their minds, it is striking
that the campaigns' onslaught of advertising is only beginning in
earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the two party nominees receives about $68 million in
federal money. So if that money were intended to influence 1
million voters, that would amount to roughly $136 that both
campaigns are spending to sway each of those all-important voters.
And while the networks estimate that 50 million people could watch
nationally televised candidate debates, the audience the candidates
are trying to reach in those debates is far narrower.
</P>
<P>
   For all the emphasis on swing voters, neither camp wants to
neglect its own supporters who may not be as loyal _ and could be
susceptible to entreaties from the other side. Rove said that while
his campaign's strategy ``is principally aimed at swing voters, you
want to get some of the weak identifiers on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, the campaigns are debating how to find the formula
to entice those swing voters. The problem is that while those
voters have been polled again and again, no one can say what moves
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of these guys,'' said Paul Maslin, a Democratic
pollster, ``is so strong right now to assume they have the magic
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Some voters, of course, are out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Hesler, 48, a house painter in Collingswood, N.J., said he
planned to support Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee. Asked what
it would take to change his mind, he laughed and replied: ``A
million dollars. On my doorstep. In cash.''

<P>
   As the academic year begins for the nation's 53 million
students, a growing number of schools are rudderless, struggling to
replace a graying corps of principals at a time when the pressure
to raise test scores and other new demands have made an already
difficult job an increasingly thankless one.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, one of every five principals has retired or resigned
in the last few months alone, some of them replaced temporarily by
other principals who retired several years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, nearly 300 principals, or 15 percent of the
total, left their jobs at the end of the last school year, with
some of them moving to the private sector and others taking their
pensions to Idaho, Oregon, Nevada and California, where desperate
districts are offering signing bonuses and other perks, according
to Washington school officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky and Texas, where the pace at which principals are
fleeing is as accelerated as it is in Vermont, job openings in some
districts that drew more than a dozen applicants as recently as
five years ago are now attracting as few as three, according to
principals' associations there.
</P>
<P>
   And in New York City, which has been unwilling to compete with
suburbs that pay principals as much as $20,000 more a year, 163
schools will open this week with a temporary administrator
welcoming students back from summer vacation. The vacancies, when
combined with the 200 schools that opened with interim principals
last September, mean that more than one in four principals' posts
turned over in New York in less than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have departed in recent months, in New York and
elsewhere, often cite the mounting stress of a job that once mostly
involved establishing an orderly and nurturing environment for
learning, and displaying a firm disciplinary hand. But during the
movement to improve schools that has swept through classrooms over
the last decade, the principal has become as visibly accountable as
a football coach, and must suffer the wrath of parents and state
monitors if a school has a losing season, as measured by falling
test scores and unmet statewide standards. In some instances
principals are being fired with no clear successor waiting in the
wings.
</P>
<P>
   Once given wide latitude, the principal has seen his autonomy
hemmed in: The movement has spawned thousands of school governing
councils, in which parents, teachers and community members weigh in
on every matter before the principal _ from teacher hiring to
lunchroom menus _ with the principal left to forge consensus.
Meanwhile, newly savvy parents have seized on obscure passages in
special-education law to wring additional services for their
children, leaving principals buried in thick binders of federal and
state statutes like beleaguered young lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want them to have a legal background and a business sense,
to know children and child development and adult development, plus
statistics, accounting and certainly technology,'' said Robbe
Brook, the superintendent of the Washington Central Supervisory
Union in central Vermont, who had to fill vacancies at three of her
five elementary schools this summer, two of them with temporary
hires.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is safety. Highly publicized shootings like those
at Columbine High School in Colorado last year have forced some
principals to affect the hawklike vigilance of Secret Service
agents, panning the cafeteria for the early warning signals of an
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Around the time of the Columbine massacre, John Willard, the
principal of Colchester High School in northern Vermont, fielded
five bomb threats in five weeks _ each necessitating that he spend
the night with the police, combing hallways in search of suspicious
packages. After 12 years in the principal's office, Willard, 52,
resigned last year to return to his math classroom, accepting a
$14,000 pay cut _ to $53,000 from $67,000 _ even though he had two
children in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start adding things up and saying, `Jeez, this isn't fun
anymore,''' Willard said.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that such jobs are usually among the highest-paying
in public education. Neal Powell, the superintendent of schools in
the small Snohomish district, 30 miles north of Seattle, lost three
of his nine elementary school principals this summer. In replacing
them, he tapped a shallow pool almost entirely filled with untested
rookies. The starting salary he was offering was a respectable
$72,768, much more than the $50,000 that is often the standard for
principals in rural districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the young stars, people we identify in the teaching
ranks, increasingly they turn to us and say, `We see what our
principal does; we don't want to do it,''' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   The vacancies are only expected to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nation's 120,000 public school principals began
working in education in the 1970s _ the median age is about 50,
according to national surveys _ and many will be eligible to retire
within five years. And teachers are retiring, too, at a time when
districts need more of them to reduce class sizes; the nation is
expected to hire 2 million new teachers in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   To fill the chair in the principal's office, schools are often
making one-year appointments, twisting the arms of veteran teachers
or turning to not-so-recent retirees. But those patched-together
arrangements can be disruptive, with teachers unsure of what
precisely they should be teaching and the principal striving to
make an impact as an acknowledged lame duck. All this in an
environment where progress in reading and math is often tied to
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, at 63, James King retired as the principal of a
middle school in central Vermont to become a sports announcer, a
dream he had harbored since the Korean War. But soon after his
debut on a local radio station, King was lured out of the booth and
flooded with offers to serve as a temporary principal at schools
around this state.
</P>
<P>
   This week, just days before the doors opened at the 150-desk
elementary school in Calais, a small town east of Montpelier, King
set aside his dreams of radio stardom yet again to slide behind
another principal's desk. He has committed to serve through June.
It is his third interim principalship in three years, and his
learning curve remains steep.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He could not, for example, figure out how to turn on the laptop
computer on his desk to compose a welcome message to his staff. And
as the children's arrival loomed, he was still working on
pronouncing his teachers' names correctly, when he was not reading
``Windows 98 for Dummies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart rate is tremendous,'' he told his staff, disarming
any concerns about his age, and his health, in their first meeting.
``My sugar is low.''
</P>
<P>
   King, who was a principal for more than two decades in Vermont
and New York, will need all the stamina he can muster in replacing
his predecessor, who resigned in June, after four years, to work on
a literacy project at the University of Vermont. Just after King
was hired in mid-August, he had to join the search for a new
teacher for a combined third- and fourth-grade class, a search he
has since completed.
</P>
<P>
   Though his little red schoolhouse looks bucolic, with cows from
a nearby farm wandering into recess, King must scale a mountain of
new requirements from the state. A flow chart directs him to write
new policies on promoting students, develop uniform curriculums
throughout the building and devise an ``action plan'' for meeting
the state's academic goals.
</P>
<P>
   As a reminder of what awaits his school if he fails, a
front-page article in The Burlington Free Press on his first day
listed 39 schools that were reprimanded by the state for
``substandard performance'' last year. That Calais Elementary was
not among them gave King and his staff little comfort.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In taking his temporary job, which pays an annual salary of
$55,000, King had to suspend his Vermont pension for a year, so as
not to be seen as double-dipping. But in an attempt to coax other
retirees back to the main office, Kentucky and Maryland recently
passed laws that permit retirees to take a principal's job and
still draw their pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Those states, and others, are also working to make the
principal's job more attractive to young recruits, often through
paid internships that show them the job up close. More than a dozen
educational foundations and nonprofit organizations are engaged in
similar work, and last year Eli Broad, chairman of the Los
Angeles-based financial services company Sun America, said he was
setting aside $100 million for urban school systems, to help train
principals and superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston-based organization called New Leaders for New Schools
was recently formed solely to recruit, train and place principals
in charter and other small public schools. And another new group,
the School Leadership Project, financed by a grant from the
Wallace-Reader's Digest Funds and based in Boston and Providence,
R.I., has begun a ``residency program'' for aspiring principals
based on a medical school model. Each candidate _ 10 are in a pilot
program this year _ will be released from the classroom and
assigned to a veteran principal for 18 months, taking on various
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Myatt, the principal of Fenway High School in Boston, said
the program would help prospective principals make an informed
decision on whether they could handle the new rigors of the
principal's job _ a sense they might not get in a traditional,
after-school master's degree program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a cobbler, you train in a shoe shop,'' said Myatt,
who is a regional coordinator for the School Leadership Project.
``The idea of continuing to train principals for the crucible of
leadership in night school is an idea that is now being
reconsidered across the country.''

announced Friday, had in fact been laid months before, according to
several senior administration and Pentagon officials. By Steven Lee
Myers, Eric Schmitt and Marc Lacey.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-SUMMIT (Undated) _ The stormy battle over globalization
that brought protests to the streets of Seattle and Washington
moves this week to the heart of the world's only truly global
organization, the United Nations. An extraordinary, three-day
``millennium summit'' of more than 150 world leaders called to
thrash out problems of poverty and peace is turning instead into a
debate about the future of the organization, as well as the world,
at a time when national boundaries have become nearly as irrelevant
to economic and political tides as they are to infectious diseases
or popular music. By Barbara Crossette.

   CROATIA-POLITICS (Dbrovnik, Croatia) _ The first seven months in

corruption under the last government that have far outstripped even
his worst imaginings. By Carlotta Gall.

</P>
<P>
   INDIA-IDOLS-POLLUTE (Bombay, India) _ At Bombay's annual Ganesh
Festival, tens of thousands of brightly painted statues of the
Hindu god Ganesh are carried through the streets, then put in
honored places in private homes or elaborate outdoor shrines. The
festival is a 10-day celebration, with as much partying as prayer,
but this year more than the monsoon will try to rain on any
parades. Nothing against Ganesh himself, but environmentalists do
not like the way the event traditionally ends, with the icons
disposed of in a ceremonial immersion, ``returned to nature'' by
being left to disintegrate in lakes, creeks and the conveniently
located Arabian Sea. By Barry Bearak.

   CHINA-SUIT (Undated) _ China is demanding that American
officials dismiss a federal civil lawsuit charging a high-ranking
official with human rights abuses stemming from the 1989 military
crackdown that killed hundreds of student protesters in Tiananmen
Square. The lawsuit was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in New
York by five people caught up in the Tiananmen Square democracy
movement against Li Peng, the country's prime minister at the time
and now the chairman of the National Peoples Congress. By Edward
Wong.

   CHINA-BEARS-ABUSE (Beijing) _ For years, the woman heard the
moaning of animals. Finally last month she could not stand it
anymore. She called a newspaper to report that a restaurant nearby
was keeping three black bears in tiny cages, milking their gall
bladders of bile to sell for its reputed medicinal value. The bears
were rescued, and their travails set off renewed debate in China
about the practice of bear farming for bile. By Erik Eckholm.

   MYANMAR-REPRESSION (Bangkok, Thailand) _ In a sudden midnight
raid, nearly 200 riot police surrounded the car where Myanmar's
pro-democracy leader had been stranded and forced her and her
companions to return home. The action brought to an abrupt end an
attempt by Aung San Suu Kyi, 55, to publicize the restrictions on
her political movement by attempting to drive from the capital of
the former Burma to meet with her supporters in another town. It
also revived international attention on the suppression of her

   JAPAN-VOLCANO (Tokyo) _ After two months of sporadic eruptions
and frequent, earth-shaking tremors in an island chain south of
Tokyo, officials have ordered the complete evacuation of Miyake
Island, which has been at the center of the seismic activity. The
evacuation comes after almost half of the island's 3,850

   VERMONT-BACKLASH (Corinth, Vt.) _ Signs in Vermont are usually
sweet: ``Maple Syrup,'' ``Farm Fresh Eggs,'' ``Country Crafts.''
But travelers over the state's winding roads at this summer's end
are more likely to encounter signs proclaiming anger, backlash made
visible: plain square black-on-white placards, thousands of them,
on barns and garages and front porches, declaring ``Take Back
Vermont.'' By Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   IOWA-CORN-ACCIDENTS (Grimes, Iowa) _ With green acres of
cornstalks rolling as far as the eye can see, these few weeks just
before the fall harvest are probably the loveliest time of the year
here. But this season is also, perhaps, the most hazardous, thanks
in large part to that very corn, which has grown to record heights
this summer with the help of some well-timed spring rains.
</P>
<P>
   MAMBO-WARS (New York) _ It could happen in any dance club
anywhere: Two people who dance to the same salsa music on different
beats. On one hand there are the people like who dance ``on 2,''
known as New York style mambo; on the other, those like who dance
``on 1,'' a majority. Dancers on the ``1'' beat say they follow the
melody, dancers on the ``2'' beat the percussion. Call it the mambo

   UNDECIDED-VOTERS (Toledo, Ohio) _ Labor Day is the unofficial
opening of the general election campaign, but for most voters the
race is already over. Strategists on both sides agree that more
than 90 percent of the electorate has by now settled on either Gov.
George W. Bush or Vice President Al Gore. That leaves the outcome
in November hinging on a sliver of expected voters _ fewer than 10
percent _ who truly have not made up their minds. By Richard L.
Berke.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-CLINTON (Portland, Maine) _ Bill Clinton has hardly
been a centerpiece of Sen. Joseph Lieberman's speeches on the
campaign trail, but in the weeks since his nomination as the
Democratic candidate for vice president, it has been clear that
Lieberman feels far freer than Al Gore to embrace the president and
claim bragging rights to the achievements of his administration. By

   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-PRICES (Washington) _ On the campaign stump, Vice President
Al Gore pushes his plan for a Medicare prescription drug benefit as
a humane effort to help older Americans who are being gouged by
profit-hungry pharmaceutical manufacturers. In television
commercials, Gov. George W. Bush's campaign characterizes the Gore
plan as another example of bureaucracy run amok. But presidential
politics, where sound bites often trump substance, is far simpler
than drug pricing, and beneath the candidates' harsh oratory lurk
complex questions about the economics of drug advertising, the

GLOBALIZATION TO TOP AGENDA OF WORLD LEADERS AT U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
   (With U.N.-SUMMIT-PRESIDE)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stormy battle over globalization that brought protests to
the streets of Seattle and Washington moves this week to the heart
of the world's only truly global organization, the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   An extraordinary, three-day Millennium Summit meeting of more
than 150 world leaders called to thrash out problems of poverty and
peace is turning instead into a debate about the future of the
organization, as well as the world, at a time when national
boundaries have become nearly as irrelevant to economic and
political tides as they are to infectious diseases or popular
music.
</P>
<P>
   The summit meeting, which will begin Wednesday and end Friday,
is the pivotal event in a two-week, traffic-stopping extravaganza
for New York that began last week with a conference of world
religious leaders, an assembly of scores of speakers from nearly
all the world's elected parliaments and a meeting of hundreds of
nongovernmental organizations, from every continent.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen or more other events are planned for the fringes this
week, including a ``dialogue of civilizations'' featuring President
Mohammad Khatami of Iran, a ``state of the world forum'' of
government and private sector leaders, numerous street protests and
a 10-hour teach-in against a greater role for global business in
world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is a more diversified organization than those
that have been the focus of recent protests _ the World Bank,
International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   So it is still seen as a hope for solving problems of
globalization, rather than as a source of them, and it is not
expected to be subjected to the same heated demonstrations that
caused so much havoc in Washington and Seattle. Still, the debate
over globalization will be intense.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, globalization means many things to many
people. It is not simply the greater movement of goods, jobs and
capital across borders, but also includes equally important
cultural, environmental and political components.
</P>
<P>
   For some countries, most of them in the industrial world,
globalization is an opportunity to expand international standards
in law, social development and human rights. For others, many of
them developing countries, it holds out the worrying prospect of a
United Nations aligning itself ever more closely with new power
centers: the big corporations, high technology gurus and cultural
icons of the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   But at this summit meeting, the fears and frustrations of the
world's smallest and weakest nations will be given equal time
alongside the powerful, whose governments and _ increasingly _
corporations are feared for the influence they seem to be gaining
inside the organization.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who will give the opening address and stay
for three days, will be followed to the podium by the president of
Equatorial Guinea. Russia's president will be followed by the
leader of the Maldives, who likes to remind others that the big
worry for his tiny nation of atolls is that globalization could
mean disappearing completely _ if the warming of the world's
climate is not halted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization is seen by some as a force for social change,
that it will help to close the gap between the rich and the poor,
the industrialized north and the developing south,'' said Theo-Ben
Gurirab, the foreign minister of Namibia and the General Assembly
president for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it also is being seen as a destructive force because it is
being driven by the very people, the colonial powers, who launched
a global campaign of imperial control of peoples and resources in
what we call now the third world. Can we trust them?''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a Ghanaian with an American
education who straddles two worlds, is at the center of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization is really defining our era,'' he said in an
interview, explaining why he forged alliances with multinational
corporations to improve labor and environmental standards as well
as to bridge cyberspace gaps between the industrial and developing
worlds.
</P>
<P>
   He also warns political leaders that they have to govern well
and learn to take advantage of international opportunities or their
fragile economies are doomed. He argues that when citizens of any
country are abused, the rulers can no longer tell others to stay
out of their affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that the secretary-general is changing things too
fast,'' Annan said, ranging over topics of relevance to the United
Nations as varied as genetically modified foods or intellectual
property rights. ``The world around us is changing, and we change
with it or we will be left behind. We have to adapt to the
realities outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Malloch Brown, administrator of the U.N. Development
Program, said that the organization cannot ignore economic changes
at a time when government aid has shrunk and international
organizations have to look for new sources of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' he said, ``everybody has to
acknowledge that the primary source of finance for development is
going to come out of the private portion of the global and national
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the U.N. system, some officials are concerned that
overtures to giant corporations and multinational industries from
the top of the organization will set the stage for problems at
lower levels. There are rules of engagement for working with
governments, one official said. But there are no guidelines for
working with businesses or independent advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful corporations, encouraged by an open door in the
secretary-general's office, have the means to introduce corrupt
arrangements or to pay for special favors among lower-ranking
officials, including the handing over of insider information like
unpublished research findings, some U.N. employees fear.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's ``global compact'' _ a program intended to enhance
cooperation between the United Nations and private corporations on
things like labor standards and the environment _ has drawn the
strongest criticism from American groups opposed to globalization,
among them the Transnational Resource and Action Center in San
Francisco. Its director, Joshua Karliner, said that the image of
the secretary-general standing beside the top executives of
companies with bad reputations in the developing world sent the
wrong message about the United Nations, and could make it a target
of protest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Karliner's organization is part of the International Forum n
Globalization, which is sponsoring the 10-hour teach-in at Town
Hall in Manhattan, beginning at 1 p.m on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Debi Barker, deputy director of the forum, said in an interview
that the teach-in follows similar events in Seattle and Washington,
where the targets were the World Trade Organization, the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund. ``The U.N., unlike the WTO,
the World Bank and the IMF, was really created to be a space to
promote peace, human rights, the environment, social justice,
livelihoods and democracy,'' she said. ``This is a worthy
institution, and these are worthy goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that things such as the global compact,
encroaching its way into the U.N., means that the U.N. is being
usurped a bit by corporations and by people who are driving this
globalization agenda. We would encourage the U.N. to take the high
road; keep to its mandate; separate itself from corporations and
deal instead with citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Bellamy, the executive director of UNICEF, the U.N.
children's fund, said that in the confrontation over globalization
there has been an unfortunate tendency to adopt extreme views about
business and that these get in the way of exploring new ways of
cooperating with the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Bellamy, a former American Peace Corps director and New York
City politician, has been wrestling recently with critics who want
the children's fund to break ties with international corporations
contributing to the organization. ``The world demands a more
sophisticated response today,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``An outright rejection of globalization is a head-in-the-sand
approach,'' she said in an interview, adding that the goals of
international aid organizations may often coincide, at least in
part, with those of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community needs peace to see economic growth.
They need kids to be educated to be consumers and workers. The rule
of law, good governance, is important for creating an environment
that will probably also be good for investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Malloch Brown of the U.N. Development Program says that the
debate about globalization in richer countries clouds the fact that
a significant number of political leaders and nongovernmental
organizations in developing nations are not opposed to a more
interdependent world economy. They just want to be part of it, and
they want it to be more sensitive to the needs of those least able
to compete.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the international economic institutions have been
caught in the globalization debate by accident, at least in the
richer countries like the United States and France.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a little bit of road kill in all of this, because an
awful lot of the activists really have a domestic agenda,'' he
said. ``They are more about the direction of national government
policies, and yet the international financial institutions are very
important bogeymen against which to organize.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan, responding to frustration about the pace and effects of
globalization in the developing world, said that he has asked the
U.N. Conference on Trade and Development to work on ways to assist
smaller nations in analyzing and simplifying complex economic and
trade agreements so that they can benefit. The new American trade
program for Africa will also be studied by U.N. experts to help
African nations to take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been said that arguing against globalization is like
arguing against the laws of gravity,'' Annan told the international
conference of nongovernmental organizations last week. ``But that
does not mean we should accept a law that allows only heavyweights
to survive. On the contrary: We must make globalization an engine
that lifts people out of hardship and misery, not a force that
holds them down.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations expects all the world's major powers to be
represented at the summit meeting _ and will make a valiant effort
to limit their formal speeches to five minutes each, with unlimited
time for more informal talking later.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to President Clinton, President Jiang Zemin of China
will attend, as will President Vladimir Putin of Russia, President
Jacques Chirac of France and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of most African nations, including Olusegun Obasanjo of
Nigeria, will speak. President Abdurrahman Wahid of Indonesia is
coming, as are Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and the
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader,
is also planning to come.
</P>
<P>
   Shadowing the U.N. summit meeting will be the fifth annual State
of the World Forum, a private gathering at the New York Hilton of
more than 500 prominent figures in finance, labor, science and
government. Speakers include Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet
president; Thabo Mbeki, president of South Africa; Colin Powell,
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the financier and
philanthropist George Soros; and John Sweeney, president of the
AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.N. summit meeting ends, there will be commitments to
some very ambitious goals, part of an action plan advertised on
billboards around New York. World leaders will pledge to halve the
number of the world's people who live on less than $1 a day. There
are more than a billion of them. Almost an equal number _ many of
the same people _ do not have access to clean water. Their number
should also be halved by 2015. By that year, leaders will pledge to
have given all children a full primary school education. To show
determination in the battle against HIV and AIDS, the leaders will
be asked to halt and reverse the spread of the disease by 2015.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of Al Gore's Senate colleagues was worried about his
late-night comings and goings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, you need to get home to your family,'' the senator,
Howell Heflin of Alabama, told Gore repeatedly back in 1990 and
1991. Heflin lived in the same Capitol Hill apartment building
where Gore's parents kept a place after they moved back to
Tennessee, and regularly spotted Al Gore getting into his car at
2:30 or 3 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept mighty late hours,'' said Heflin, who is now retired,
in an interview. ``Maybe I'd be up for some reason and I'd look out
the window and see him depart.''
</P>
<P>
   He need not have concerned himself, though. This particular
midlife crisis was being worked out through work _ lots of it _ and
the pied-a-terre was where he holed up to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had embarrassed himself by running for president before he
was ready, in 1988. He shuttered that campaign, his first losing
effort, just as he was turning 40. Not quite a year later, he
watched a car hit his 6-year-old son. His therapy, his catharsis,
his way of making sense of all that he had been through, was a
writing project that became the book ``Earth in the Balance,'' an
environmental call to arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to take stock, but didn't really know how to do it,''
Gore said, self-critically, in a recent interview. ``It was obvious
to me I had a lot of growing to do, yet I channeled my feeling into
the global environmental crisis and addressing it.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to an earlier vision of himself, as a writer _ a
role he seems to see as superior to that of a politician. And in
his writing, he atoned for what he saw as his sins as a candidate.
``The harder truth,'' he wrote in the book, ``is that I simply
lacked the strength to keep on talking about the environmental
crisis constantly, whether it was being reported in the press or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   He had certainly not regretted turning 40 _ finally, he thought,
after years playing down his youth in races against older men. ``I
was delighted,'' he said recently, then mocked his delight. ``I
thought 40 was laden with gravitas.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at midlife, nothing was going as planned. The campaign had
left him heavily in debt and unsure how much it had hurt his
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Even his wife was mad at him. They were getting into it pretty
regularly in front of staff, usually over his crammed schedule.
Though he had tried to preserve some semblance of family life by
bringing his children on the road, that had not worked out, either.
</P>
<P>
   After his son's accident, in April 1989, he blamed himself, and
not only because he had been holding Albert's hand before the boy
broke free and ran into traffic. ``He was thinking about how much
time had he really taken with his son,'' said Chip Forrester, a
Senate aide. ``And if he had died, how much he would have
regretted.''
</P>
<P>
   In a darkened car in rural Tennessee a few months later, Gore
tried to describe the scene to Forrester, who recounted the
conversation in an interview. ``I looked down and his hand was
slipping out of my hand,'' Gore said. ``Why was it doing that? Then
he was sliding through traffic and everything was slow motion.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy made it across two lanes before he was struck by a '77
Chevy and thrown 20 feet. ``I couldn't get to him fast enough,''
Gore told his aide. ``I turned his head and he was alive, but we
didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had him'' and let go, he said, almost whispering. ``I HAD
HIM.''
</P>
<P>
   The child had half of his spleen removed to stop internal
bleeding, and spent nearly a month in the hospital and weeks after
that in a full body cast. As he began to recover, Gore felt that he
himself was getting a second shot at life.
</P>
<P>
   If the result was not an all-new Al Gore _ and it wasn't _ at
this time in the life of a newly chastened Gore, he did learn to do
things differently. He put his four children's soccer games and
school plays on the schedule, in ink. And traded his dozen-a-day
Diet Cokes for club soda with cranberry juice. He made changes
large and small, much like George W. Bush, who stopped drinking and
got serious after 40.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was still a workhorse, though, still someone who would want
to explore the public policy implications of his personal crisis.
So instead of sticking close to home, he stepped up his travels to
environmental hot spots, including Antarctica and the Amazon, to
inspect the damage himself. And rather than cut back his hours, he
took on the second demanding job of writing a book.
</P>
<P>
   The astonishing thing Gore did with his second shot, though, was
to write the sort of book that could do serious damage to a sitting
senator with aspirations. Knowing he would run for president again
some day, Gore produced a work certain to be used against him _
iconoclastic, personal and full of fat targets for ridicule. In
terms certain to be lampooned, he connected the dots between family
dysfunction and man's collective callousness toward nature.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Earth in the Balance,'' Gore also revealed himself in
baldly unflattering ways, harshly judging his own failings as a man
and a politician. ``I began to doubt my own political judgment'' in
the 1988 campaign, he wrote, ``so I began to ask the pollsters and
professional politicians what they thought I ought to talk about.
As a result, for much of the campaign I discussed what everybody
else discussed, which too often was a familiar list of what the
insiders agree are `the issues.'''
</P>
<P>
   Friends remember asking one another: Was he trying to blow up
his career? He sounded the alarm about global warming, then an
obscure issue. He swore off ``finger-to-the-wind'' politics. And as
if to ensure that, he recommended the retirement of the internal
combustion engine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe deeply that true change is possible,'' he wrote,
``only when it begins inside the person who is advocating it.
Mahatma Gandhi said it well: `We must be the change we wish to see
in the world.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then, barely back from his book tour, Gore hooked up with Bill
Clinton _ who as governor of Arkansas was not exactly known as an
ardent environmentalist. And he took a post that requires whoever
holds it to be the opposite of independent, brave and out there.
</P>
<P>
   `IS HE SERIOUS?'  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When John Sterling, then editor in chief of Houghton Mifflin,
heard in June 1990 that Sen. Al Gore wanted to write a book on the
global environment, he was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't interested in some kind of campaign book,'' Sterling
recalled telling Gore's agent, Mort Janklow. ``I don't do those
books. I thought, `Are we talking a ghostwriter? Is he serious?'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he traveled to Washington, thinking he might get half an
hour, tops, with the would-be writer, probably in tandem with some
aide who would have to walk Gore through the material.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``we spent three hours all alone, and he spoke with
genuine passion and an amazing breadth of knowledge,'' Sterling
said. ``I came back thinking, `By God, a politician writing a
serious book about a controversial subject.' He had 80 percent of
the book in his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore hired a researcher and a clerical assistant, and worked
closely with Sterling to impose a cogent structure on, in the
editor's words, the ``287 things he knew he wanted to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also wanted a little editorial hand-holding. ``I have my
own issues I want to work through here,'' he told Sterling. ``How
much Al Gore should there be'' in the book? ``How personal should
it be?''
</P>
<P>
   But he did write it himself.
</P>
<P>
   And while he worked on the book, he was unusually prolific in
other ways: he helped organize the National Religious Partnership
for the Environment _ faith-based groups mobilizing to protect
nature. He came up with Family Reunion, an annual symposium on
problems facing families, which is still held every summer in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   He was also uncharacteristically bold as a lawmaker during this
period. A month after his son's accident, he had introduced a bill
financing a $1.7 billion program to expand what was then called the
information superhighway _ and yes, he did contribute to the
development of the Internet. The bill supported research and
development for fiber optics and required the Pentagon to upgrade
the computer network that was the Internet's forerunner. And it
financed research crucial to expanding the Internet beyond military
uses. Gore spent three years pushing it before President George
Bush signed it into law in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In the thick of his writing project, in January 1991, he cast a
vote that seemed sure to end whatever might be left of his career
after his book came out. He voted with Republicans _ and only nine
other Senate Democrats (including Joseph Lieberman, now his running
mate) _ in favor of the Persian Gulf War, infuriating party
leaders. The Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, refused to
speak to Gore for months, and made it difficult for him to speak on
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a traitor, someone who had abandoned the Democrats,''
said a former Gore aide, Steve Owens. It is ironic that people
later accused Gore of trying to position himself to run as a
moderate in 1992, Owens said. ``Because if Al Gore ever cast a
nonpolitical vote, that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   `NOW WHAT DO WE TALK ABOUT?'  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore also began do-it-yourself psychotherapy. And though he can
still say, as he has, ``I was never on a couch,'' he took that work
seriously, too.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first meetings Gore had after his son's accident was
with a Knoxville, Tenn., psychotherapist, Dr. Lance Laurence, and
five of his colleagues, who wanted him to support a bill increasing
Medicare coverage for the treatment of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   In the very first minute of the meeting, though, Gore said he
already favored the bill. ``It was, `OK, now what do we talk
about?''' Laurence recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The therapists could hardly have been more surprised by the
two-hour discussion of intimacy and identity that followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very psychological-minded,'' Laurence said. ``There was
a click, and we were all able to talk about things that were
important, about meaning versus disconnectedness and the pathology
of narcissism.'' Gore knew a lot about Robert Bly's book ``Iron
John,'' which discusses the damage that distant fathers do their
sons.
</P>
<P>
   And as Gore talked, Laurence thought that this ``wasn't some
theoretical experience with no personal resonance. He was trying to
make sense of this for himself and had an emotional appreciation of
those issues because he'd been there.''
</P>
<P>
   That night began what one of Gore's friends called his
``psychotherapy by correspondence course.'' He read books
recommended by Laurence, devoured Carl Jung, listened to personal
development tapes in his car and, according to aides, regularly
talked to Laurence on his car phone about what he was reading.
</P>
<P>
   Why not do therapy the old-fashioned way? Gore and his wife,
Tipper, often talk about the need to destigmatize it; would seeking
counseling have been so shameful?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had family counseling'' at the hospital after his son's
accident, Gore said, ``and we talked about that, but I never really
considered doing therapy for myself. I didn't think I needed it,
though I would encourage anyone who does to get it.'' Then he
added, ``Well, Tipper helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends thought Gore shunned counseling less because he feared
exposure than because he is the do-it-yourself type and doesn't
take help that easily _ as he has repeatedly shown in the current
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   How much his wife was able to help him at that moment is
unclear. She has said that their son's accident triggered a
clinical depression, which was treated with medication and therapy.
And though she has not said exactly when that was, one friend said
that the accident, which she also witnessed, ``sent her into a
complete tailspin.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore did re-examine his life, and in his reading was
particularly taken with ``The Drama of the Gifted Child,'' by Alice
Miller, a book he handed out to friends and drew on in his own
writing. The book speaks to the high-achieving children of
narcissistic parents, who can lose track of their own desires while
striving to please.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has never spoken other than respectfully of his own
self-made, intensely ambitious mother and father. But in his book,
he wrote this: ``A developing child in a dysfunctional family
searches his parent's face for signals that he is whole and all is
right with the world; when he finds no such approval, he begins to
feel that something is wrong inside. And because he doubts his
worth and authenticity, he begins controlling his inner experience
_ smothering spontaneity, masking emotion, diverting creativity
into robotic routine.''
</P>
<P>
   A STRAIN ON THE FAMILY  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Gore was writing those words, he was struggling to stay true
to his promise to spend more time with his own children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been a real strain on the family,'' said Owens, who
worked for Gore in both the House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore's relationship with his wife remained tense for some
time after their son's accident. His staff saw a relationship that
seemed passionate _ they witnessed some major smooches, too _ and
very real, but with real fights to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   One night, months after the accident, Tipper Gore was with her
husband in Tennessee, where she was to appear with him at a
fund-raiser for his 1990 senatorial race. In the car on the way
there, she asked him to brief her on the event. Who would be there?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the typical fund-raiser,'' he told her, according to
the aide who drove that night. ``We've done this a million times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you say that,'' she answered. ``But then I get there and
it's different and then I can't live up to your expectations. I'm
here and the least you can do ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``You do fine,'' he told her, as the aide remembers it. ``You're
making a mountain out of a molehill.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight went on like that until Gore finally threw a sheaf of
briefing papers at his wife, who was behind him in the back seat.
``Here, read this,'' he told her. Then Gore put his seat back in a
reclining position and almost instantly went to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made her even madder,'' said the aide, who stole a glance
in the rear-view mirror and saw her reading and fuming.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Tipper Gore said in a general discussion
of family life that she and her husband believe ``even fighting is
communication,'' and have no desire to be portrayed as the kind of
no-muss, no-fuss, picture-perfect couple that does not exist in
nature. ``At times it needs to go into the Jiffy Lube,'' she said
of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of those times. And things did change. ``Tipper had
a lot more influence on the schedule, and they started going on
dates,'' Forrester said, though ``some of the staff resented it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the thick of his presidential campaign, the Gores still
go on dates; they took in ``The Perfect Storm'' one recent Sunday
night. And Gore takes enormous pride in having been to all but one
of his son's high school football games last year. Friends recall
that Gore's own father never attended one of his.
</P>
<P>
   As he was working on becoming a more present husband and father,
Gore became aware that he had not always been the world's most
sensitive boss. As a result, he brought in a management consultant
to hear his staff members' frustrations, and even took them on
retreat in West Virginia. He tried harder to listen to their
concerns, they said, and let them put their children's soccer games
on the schedule, too.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his debates with former Sen. Bill Bradley during the
primary season, the candidates were asked what mistake in life they
had learned the most from, and Gore said this: ``Early in my career
in public service, I fell prey to what a lot of people who get into
the work force and get excited about their work do. And they get
drawn into it so much that they don't balance their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gore again had the chance to speak, he circled back to the
question. ``Every time you are in a situation with a friend or a
small group where you are unkind unnecessarily, that is a mistake
and there is no excuse for it, whether it's stress or whatever,''
he said. ``And as you get older and mature, if things go well you
learn from those mistakes and stop doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   A DIFFICULT DECISION  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was finishing the first draft of ``Earth in the Balance,''
and it was time to choose: was he running for president in 1992, or
wasn't he?
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't changed so much that he wasn't tempted. He wanted to
run, no question. But his family needed him. Not only that, but he
had said publicly that his family needed him, that he was trying to
be around more.
</P>
<P>
   As one friend said, he had said it so often that to have run
would not only have broken the spirit of his promise to his family;
it would also have made that broken promise obvious to all the
world.
</P>
<P>
   His old Tennessee friend Steve Armistead said, ``His quiet
answer to me was, `Bush's ratings are so high with Desert Storm,
it's not in my interest to get in this.'''
</P>
<P>
   He told his editor, Sterling, that he wanted to finish the book,
which was far too long and needed major revisions. ``It became
clear that he could not finish the book and run for president,''
Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   As in his decision to go to Vietnam, a number of factors came
into play. He spent a family vacation on a houseboat on a lake in
Tennessee in August 1991, mulling his final decision. Then he
announced that he would not run, though he seemed grumpy about it,
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak to whether I seemed thrilled,'' he said
recently, bristling a little. ``But I knew it was right because it
was a very hard decision,'' he added, echoing the lesson, drilled
into him as a prep-school student at St. Albans and mentioned in
his recent convention speech, about taking the ``hard right over
the easy wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For whatever combination of reasons, Gore chose his family and
his book. And in the spring of 1992, Al Gore the author became the
kind of hit Al Gore the candidate never was.
</P>
<P>
   At a small book party at his high school friend Reed Hundt's
house, Gore could hardly contain himself. ``He stood on my stairs
and said, ``I hope you like it, because this book is me,''' Hundt
remembered. `` `I hope you know it's really me.'''
</P>
<P>
   The book was eventually translated into more than 20 languages
and sold more than half a million copies. It was a best seller for
eight weeks even before Bill Clinton chose to put Gore on the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not know Gore well at the time, and chose him at
least in part because of ``Earth in the Balance.'' Rahm Emanuel,
then Clinton's senior adviser, remembered that at the first meeting
to discuss the vice-presidential short list, he saw the book on
Clinton's night stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been up until all hours of the morning reading that,''
Emanuel said. ``When we got to Gore's name he praised the book, and
was very taken with it. I always believed it was Gore's writing and
thoughtfulness that caught his attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But why, after working so hard on his environmental manifesto
and political declaration of independence, did Gore accept
Clinton's invitation?
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in his car, Gore described it as something
of a sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was quite ambivalent,'' he said. ``But it's not just about
me and how I want to spend my time and contribute while enjoying my
life. I was feeling very content, even joyful. I was enjoying what
I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Two friends said Gore told them much the same thing at the time.
Someone close to Clinton who participated in the selection process
remembered it this way: ``He was not disinterested, but he didn't
drop and do 50, either,'' the confidant said, referring to the way
Gore began training right after deciding to make his first run for
Congress. ``He wasn't doing what other people were doing, which was
position themselves. He did not campaign for it.''
</P>
<P>
   After thinking it over, Gore said, ``I thought it mattered a lot
to the cause that I wrote about whether we had four or eight years
of moving in the right direction and laying the groundwork to a
solution for global warming, compared to another four years of
neglect'' under Republicans. ``I really felt we were headed for
trouble, and I thought that between Bush and Clinton, Clinton would
do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a ringing endorsement of Clinton as an environmentalist,
though probably an accurate one.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the same conversation, though, Gore challenged the
premise that Clinton had not made the environment a priority in
Arkansas. ``It was not an awful record,'' he said. ``It was mixed,
certainly mixed, and gave me cause for concern.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had made clear to Clinton before accepting the job
that he expected their administration to take the issue seriously.
In fact, he said, when Warren Christopher, who was in charge of the
search for a running mate, asked him how he would respond if
Clinton offered him a spot on the ticket, he said that before
answering, he wanted to have a serious discussion with Clinton
about the environment.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a quid pro quo, he made clear, and he signaled that
if all went well he certainly would join the ticket. But, he said,
``I wanted to make it THE topic.'' And when Clinton did call to
offer him the job, Gore said, ``He began by saying, `I'd like to
talk to you about the environment.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the first of their weekly lunches Gore showed his new boss
some charts on global warming, he said, adding that a good 90
percent of their lunches at least touched on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore often touts the Clinton administration's work in
strengthening clean air regulations, forcing companies to disclose
the toxins they use and protecting huge new tracts of land in the
West. But some environmentalists have expressed disappointment over
the consequences of the NAFTA treaty and say the administration
should have more aggressively forced industry to curtail greenhouse
gases.
</P>
<P>
   In the current campaign, the vice president has at least
sporadically tried to make an issue of the environment, though
again, this focus has not received extensive coverage. And he has
not backed off anything he said in ``Earth in the Balance,'' which
was reissued this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about possible regrets, he quickly said oh, yes, and spoke
of a number of writerly, rather than political, qualms. Lots of
good stuff got cut, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But has he been as faithful to the part of his book that
promised an end to ``finger-to-the-wind'' politics? Again, he was
quick to say yes. Told that that was not the general consensus, he
showed his frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly what they would cite other than Elian,''
he said. His position that the case of the young Cuban refugee
Elian Gonzalez should have been handled in family court was widely
seen as a sop to Florida's Cuban population. ``And that happens to
be inaccurate because when I took that position I knew it was
hurting me, even in Florida. And absent that issue, I don't know of
another one where there's a claim I understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the new clothes, the new headquarters, the new
proposals? For the first time in more than a dozen long interviews,
Gore looked as if he might scream. ``That's a myth!'' he cried,
leaning forward, very close to his interviewer in the car. ``Tipper
and Karenna,'' his oldest daughter, ``took me to a store and said
we're sick of these dark suits. What's the big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   But then, asked how he would know if he had sold out, Gore not
only simmered down but almost laughed. ``I don't know,'' he said,
``because I haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   To walk the line between idealism and compromise that is
politics, he said, ``you find the limits of the possible and you
push.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' he said, ``if you're going to climb a mountain, you
need to do a number of things to get ready _ plan the route,
identify the base camp, get the supplies and, hopefully, some luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a mountain,'' he added, referring to his environmental
goals but also to his presidential campaign. ``And I've been
planning to climb this mountain for a pretty good while.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of Al Gore's Senate colleagues was worried about his
late-night comings and goings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, you need to get home to your family,'' the senator,
Howell Heflin of Alabama, told Gore repeatedly back in 1990 and
1991. Heflin lived in the same Capitol Hill apartment building
where Gore's parents kept a place after they moved back to
Tennessee, and regularly spotted Al Gore getting into his car at
2:30 or 3 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept mighty late hours,'' said Heflin, who is now retired,
in an interview. ``Maybe I'd be up for some reason and I'd look out
the window and see him depart.''
</P>
<P>
   He need not have concerned himself, though. This particular
midlife crisis was being worked out through work _ lots of it _ and
the pied-a-terre was where he holed up to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had embarrassed himself by running for president before he
was ready, in early 1988. He shuttered that campaign, his first
losing effort, just as he was turning 40. In April 1989, he watched
a car hit his 6-year-old son. His therapy, his catharsis, his way
of making sense of all he had been through, was a writing project
that became the book ``Earth in the Balance,'' an environmental
call to arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to take stock, but didn't really know how to do it,''
Gore said, self-critically, in a recent interview. ``It was obvious
to me I had a lot of growing to do, yet I channeled my feeling into
the global environmental crisis and addressing it.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to an earlier vision of himself, as a writer _ a
role he seems to see as superior to that of a politician. And in
his writing, he atoned for what he saw as his sins as a candidate.
``The harder truth,'' he wrote in the book, ``is that I simply
lacked the strength to keep on talking about the environmental
crisis constantly, whether it was being reported in the press or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   He had certainly not regretted turning 40 _ finally, he thought,
after years playing down his youth in races against older men. ``I
was delighted,'' he said recently, then mocked his delight. ``I
thought 40 was laden with gravitas.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at midlife, nothing was going as planned. The campaign had
left him heavily in debt and unsure how much it had hurt his
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Even his wife was mad at him. They were getting into it pretty
regularly in front of staff, usually over his crammed schedule.
Though he had tried to preserve some semblance of family life by
bringing his children on the road, that had not worked out, either.
</P>
<P>
   If the result was not an all-new Al Gore _ and it wasn't _ at
this time in the life of a newly chastened Gore, he did learn to do
things differently. He put his four children's soccer games and
school plays on the schedule, in ink. And traded his dozen-a-day
Diet Cokes for club soda with cranberry juice. He made changes
large and small, much like George W. Bush, who stopped drinking and
got serious after 40.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was still a workhorse, though, still someone who would want
to explore the public policy implications of his personal crisis.
So instead of sticking close to home, he stepped up his travels to
environmental hot spots, including Antarctica and the Amazon, to
inspect the damage himself. And rather than cut back his hours, he
took on the second demanding job of writing a book.
</P>
<P>
   The astonishing thing Gore did with his second shot, though, was
to write the sort of book that could do serious damage to a sitting
senator with aspirations. Knowing he would run for president again
some day, Gore produced a work certain to be used against him _
iconoclastic, personal and full of fat targets for ridicule. In
terms certain to be lampooned, he connected the dots between family
dysfunction and man's collective callousness toward nature.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Earth in the Balance,'' Gore also revealed himself in
baldly unflattering ways, harshly judging his own failings as a man
and a politician. ``I began to doubt my own political judgment'' in
the 1988 campaign, he wrote, ``so I began to ask the pollsters and
professional politicians what they thought I ought to talk about.
As a result, for much of the campaign I discussed what everybody
else discussed, which too often was a familiar list of what the
insiders agree are `the issues.'''
</P>
<P>
   Friends remember asking one another: Was he trying to blow up
his career? He sounded the alarm about global warming, then an
obscure issue. He swore off ``finger-to-the-wind'' politics. And as
if to ensure that, he recommended the retirement of the internal
combustion engine.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore was finishing the first draft of ``Earth in the
Balance,'' it was time decide: was he running for president in
1992, or wasn't he?
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't changed so much that he wasn't tempted. He wanted to
run, no question. But his family needed him. Not only that, but he
had said publicly that his family needed him, that he was trying to
be around more.
</P>
<P>
   As one friend said, he had said it so often that to have run
would not only have broken the spirit of his promise to his family;
it would also have made that broken promise obvious to all the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not see President George Bush as vulnerable. Gore's old
Tennessee friend Steve Armistead said, ``His quiet answer to me
was, `Bush's ratings are so high with Desert Storm, it's not in my
interest to get in this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told his editor, John Sterling of Houghton Mifflin, that he
wanted to finish the book, which was far too long and needed major
revisions. ``It became clear that he could not finish the book and
run for president,'' Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever combination of reasons, Gore chose his family and

   ``This is a mountain,'' he added, referring to his environmental
goals but also to his presidential campaign. ``And I've been
planning to climb this mountain for a pretty good while.''

SENIORS BRISTLE AT DRIVER AGE BIAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DENNIS McCARTHY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAN NUYS, Calif. _ The parking lot was almost full at the San
Fernando Valley's most popular seniors' hangout, officially the
Organization for the Needs of the Elderly. Everybody just calls it
ONE.
</P>
<P>
   It is here at two North Los Angeles locations - in Reseda and
Van Nuys - that more than 400 seniors from all over the Valley come
every day to mingle, take some classes and break a little bread
together.
</P>
<P>
   The men usually hang out with the men, the women with the women,
but there is one thing they always share every morning.
</P>
<P>
   That parking lot for their cars.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't count their grandkids and Social Security checks,
one of the most important things in their lives is that car parked
outside, a lot of these seniors say.
</P>
<P>
   It's their lifeline to continued independence.
</P>
<P>
   We may take that car for granted most of our lives, but when you
retire and those-not-so-golden years come, you take nothing for
granted, including your ability to get around.
</P>
<P>
   That's why so many seniors were upset Thursday morning over at
Leo Maggio's ONE Straight Talk class at the Valley Senior Service &AMP;
Resource Center. It's happening again, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Senior bashing.
</P>
<P>
   The topic getting some straight talk was front-page news. A
91-year-old man, Val Conrad of Sylmar, had killed a 1-year-old boy
and injured three other people when he accidentally hit the gas
pedal on his car instead of the brake and drove through the front
door of a bank.
</P>
<P>
   The tragic incident put the spotlight back on a hot-button issue
in this country: Should there be stricter rules and guidelines for
driving a car when people get older and their reflexes slow down?
</P>
<P>
   Even in Leo's class of all seniors in their 70s and 80s, you
can't get a straight answer on this one, but you do get a lot of
questions that need to be answered.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is, Why should senior citizens as a group bear the
brunt of criticism when one in their ranks is involved in a tragic
accident like this?
</P>
<P>
   Do we yell about severely curtailing the driving rights of all
teen-agers, or adults driving with a cell phone stuck in their ear
when one in their ranks screws up?
</P>
<P>
   Do we tell mothers who get distracted by their children while
driving, and have an accident that they can't drive with children
in the car anymore?
</P>
<P>
   Nope, we just tell them to be more careful next time. With
seniors, we start screaming: ``Age!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's discrimination to pick on one group because somebody in
it has had an accident like this,'' said Trudy Gollub, as Izzy
Silverstein nodded his head vigorously in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't judge people by the group they are in,'' Izzy says.
``I'm in my 80s and still driving OK, even with a woman in the
car.''
</P>
<P>
   The line draws a guarded laugh because there is nothing really
funny about senior drivers getting bashed again, these people say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the individual, not age, whether he or she
should be driving or not,'' says Toby Cummins. ``Some people are
old at 60, some are young at 80. I've had friends who have given up
their licenses when they thought it was time.''
</P>
<P>
   But giving up your driver's license is one of the hardest
decisions a senior will ever have to make, these people say. They
will fight it to the bitter end.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are basically being asked to give up your independence,
too, and no one wants to do that,'' says Clare Karish, who like all
the others thinks public transportation in the Valley stinks
because it is too unreliable and slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when the time comes, I will give up my driver's license,''
Clare said.
</P>
<P>
   But who should choose that time? Seniors themselves? Their
families? Their doctors? The Department of Motor Vehicles? They
can't agree, although they think the counsel of family and doctors
is important.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing they can agree on is that men are more
stubborn than women in realizing when that time has come.
</P>
<P>
   Leo admits that over the years he has had to follow some of the
men in his class home because he was worried about their medical
condition to drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched them drive over curbs and cross the double yellow
lines,'' Leo said. ``I've had to tell their wives that it was time
to get their husbands to give up their licenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Greenstein said he was speaking with some young people
recently who thought old people drove too slowly, a common
complaint. He seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe older people should have a limited license,'' Harry
said.
</P>
<P>
   The others disagreed, vehemently. If young people think older
drivers go to slow, maybe the state should turn the diamond lane
into the senior lane, a few of them said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   One thing everyone agreed on though. Whatever happens next, it
has to cut across all age groups, not just senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same should hold true for young people and everyone
else,'' Clare said. ``If they're reckless, we should get on their
backs, like everyone's getting on ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Just bashing the seniors again isn't the answer.

ADVENTUROUS? SLURP A LERP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One man's pest is another man's pastry.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest assault on the eucalyptus tree crippling red gum
lerp psyllid, a naturalist insists that making a tasty snack of the
insects and their excretions will help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classifying the lerp psyllid as a problem is a matter of
perspective,'' said Christopher Nyerges, a Los Angeles resident who
has taught natural food and survival classes for more than two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view it as another resource,'' he said. ``Obviously, I don't
think people are going to eat it to the extent that it will be
eradicated, but if I were hungry and homeless, I could scrape up
enough of this to have a good little snack in about 15 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   First spotted in the Los Angeles region in 1998, the lerp has
spread rapidly to thousands of eucalyptus trees, damaging and even
killing them while excreting a sticky goo that gums up people and
cars.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, a batch of Australian, non-stinging wasps was
released experimentally to eat the lerps, which originated down
under. But that has not been entirely successful.
</P>
<P>
   Visible on the leaves of infested trees is a white, bubbly
substance excreted by the lerp and woven into a protective tent
under which the pupae, or baby insects, grow.
</P>
<P>
   Nyerges describes the lerp tent as a sticky, waxy, sweet treat
that can be licked off the leaf, pupae and all, similar to a
honeycomb.
</P>
<P>
   For hundreds of years, he said, Australians have eaten the lerp.
Aborigines still commonly use the honey-like substance as a
sweetener for cold or hot drinks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   University of California, Berkeley, researcher Donald Dahlsten,
who heads the Australian wasp campaign, agreed that lerps are
tasty, and he often snacks on them in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I eat them all the time,'' he said. ``The idea is to get the
fresh white ones instead of having to clean off the black dirty
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   But he remains hopeful that the wasp remedy will be successful
in time without damaging the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some complications with mating the wasps during
these first few weeks and it's too early to see definitive
results,'' he said. ``But we plan on releasing more around Southern
California in coming weeks, and hope to have clear results soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty Friedman, a tree surgeon with the Los Angeles Recreation
and Parks Department, said he doubts hungry Angelenos would stem
the lerp ravage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might be able to eat that white, gooey stuff,'' he said,
``but we need to do something about the bigger problem of trees at
risk.''

STATE'S BIRTHDAY MILESTONE PARTY WILL BE LOW-KEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Can you say ``sesquicentennial''?
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, neither can most people. Nor do many Californians
know that it is a 150th birthday and that this state will celebrate
it September 9.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of political bungles, canceled events and
millions of squandered public dollars, California will hold a
low-key 150th anniversary of statehood with hardly anybody even
aware of the milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the name of the event?'' asked Tom Laliberte, a
special events coordinator for Abbey Rents in Burbank. ``That's the
first I've heard of that. Sounds like quite a landmark.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Los Angeles Daily News called one lawmaker's office to
inquire about the sesquicentennial, a receptionist replied: ``The
what? Can you please spell that?''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, 1850, known as Admission Day, President Millard
Fillmore signed the bill admitting California as the 31st state of
the Union.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, 2000, a handful of historical groups will put on
luncheons, parties and exhibits, despite plans that were in the
works three years ago to put on an expensive and public-sponsored
party.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the events are planned to take place in Sacramento Sept.
8-10, including fireworks, the exhibition of a schooner built in
California in 1891, and a festival.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, folks can listen to a lecture and tour a
Gold Rush exhibit at the Huntington Library in San Marino. And
that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   A legislative task force report issued last year sharply
criticized a state sesquicentennial commission after a ``tall
ships'' race - which was to anchor the celebration - was canceled
for lack of funding and the group was unable to secure private
donations for other events.
</P>
<P>
   Then, an Assembly committee yanked the commission's funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the prior administration, several million dollars was
spent in anticipation of a three-year celebration that never
happened,'' said Assemblyman Michael Machado, D-Stockton, who
chaired a committee that investigated the commission. ``They were
overaggressive in their assessment of their ability to raise funds
to support the program and so they went out of existence.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, California lawmakers approved nearly $900,000
in funding for next week's celebration in Sacramento, the state's
capital city.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, birthday party planning has been left to local
history groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any problems,'' said Midge Sherwood, a
historian and author in San Marino who is organizing that
community's event.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwood said it's important to recognize the sesquicentennial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If California hadn't been admitted to the Union, the United
States would not have had a Pacific Coast harbor, and you know how
important that is today.''
</P>
<P>
   And, for the record, it's pronounced ``Ses-kwi-sen-TEN-yel.''

RUSSIAN RESISTANCE A KEY TO DELAY ON MISSILE SHIELD
</HEADLINE>
 This article was reported by STEVEN LEE MYERS, ERIC SCHMITT and
MARC LACEY, and was written by MYERS.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, visibly tired after an 11-hour flight from
Cairo, Egypt, and still focused on the Middle East, President
Clinton met at the White House with two of his closest advisers to
hear Secretary of Defense William Cohen appeal one last time for
making the bold decision to build a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, speaking forthrightly and matter-of-factly, conceded that
technological hurdles remained, and that the Pentagon's schedule
for completing a system by 2005 had become no more than a hope.
``Still,'' a senior defense official said, ``he felt we should
proceed with construction,'' to give Clinton's successor a head
start toward building a system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left the meeting without declaring his intentions, but
by then the outcome was a formality, administration officials now
say. The foundation for the decision he announced Friday in a
hastily arranged speech at Georgetown University had in fact been
laid months before, several senior administration and Pentagon
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision not to authorize even initial construction of
a national missile shield had been shaped by events as far back as
January, these officials said, when the Russians first made it
clear they would not negotiate changes in the Antiballistic Missile
Treaty of 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's calculated plan for making a decision about
a limited missile shield in the election year 2000 _ drafted in
part as political defense of Vice President Al Gore in his campaign
for the presidency _ had begun to unravel even before it got very
far. And it did so because of events that were largely out of the
administration's control.
</P>
<P>
   The startling diplomatic opening of Kim Jong Il of North Korea,
culminating in a summit meeting with his South Korean counterpart
in June, gave support to critics of missile defense that the threat
of a rogue attack had been overstated. And the spectacular failure
of the Pentagon's test of its high-speed missile interceptor in
July left insurmountable doubts about whether the technology was
ready.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, however, the administration could not predict
domestic politics in Russia. The administration's plan rested on
negotiating a deal with Moscow to allow construction of a limited
missile shield without scrapping the Antiballistic Missile Treaty.
That treaty, signed by the United States and the Soviet Union, and
viewed by some as the cornerstone of Cold War arms control, sought
to prevent nuclear war by forcing Washington and Moscow to remain
equally vulnerable to the other's attack.
</P>
<P>
   But any chance of a deal with Russia disintegrated along with
the political fortunes of the man on whom this diplomatic strategy
depended, Boris Yeltsin, who was viewed by American negotiators as
more pliable than his successor as Russian president, Vladimir
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that when Boris Yeltsin was president, there was a
decent chance of getting the deal we wanted in the course of this
year,'' a senior administration official said. ``When Putin came
in, that changed. Putin is, among other things, the un-Boris.''
</P>
<P>
   With each of these events, support within the administration for
building a missile defense withered. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright was so unenthusiastic she virtually dropped out of the
internal debate, leaving the issue to her deputy, Strobe Talbott,
administration officials said. Opposition had so hardened at the
White House and State Department that officials at the National
Security Council were said to have expressed quiet relief when the
test failed in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a joke over here that they were burning incense at the
NSC before the test, hoping it would fail,'' a senior Pentagon
official said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was Cohen, the sole Republican in the president's
cabinet, who continued to advocate sticking to the timetable the
administration had drafted _ long after all of Clinton's other
senior advisers had concluded that to do so would be a
technological leap of faith and a diplomatic disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had almost no role in the
debate or the decision, showed little enthusiasm, Pentagon
officials said, believing that protecting against shorter-range
missiles capable of hitting American troops overseas was the more
pressing concern. They were especially worried, these officials
said, that an expensive missile defense would drain dollars from
conventional forces.
</P>
<P>
   Several administration officials said that Cohen's hold-out
position created by far the most striking schism among Clinton's
foreign policy advisers, who pride themselves on forging public
unity and keeping disagreements to themselves. The ``ABC team'' _
the administration's alphabetical shorthand for Albright, Sandy
Berger, the national security adviser, and Cohen _ had previously
never failed to reach consensus on a significant issue before
submitting it to Clinton. The only other time one official could
recall Cohen being overruled was when he argued against imposing
sanctions on Myanmar in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been one of the more divisive issues in the defense
establishment, in the arms control community and in the
administration,'' said a senior official who was immersed in the
debates.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after Clinton made his announcement Friday, Cohen
did not appear in public to explain his views. He simply released a
curt statement that, at least indirectly, made his zeal for
pursuing missile defense clear. ``I have noted on many occasions
that several emerging threats warrant the deployment of an
effective missile defense program as soon as technologically
feasible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Clinton's actions signaled that he was an
unenthusiastic supporter of building a national missile defense.
When he came into office in 1993, he scaled back what remnants were
left of the research that Ronald Reagan had begun with his dream of
a Star Wars defense against the threat of ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, however, the debate over limited missile defenses
intensified. A committee heavily weighted with Republicans and led
by Donald Rumsfeld, who served as secretary of defense under
President Gerald Ford, reported that the threat of ballistic
missiles from countries like North Korea, Iran or Iraq was no
longer a distant one.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, as if to prove the point, North Korea fired a
Taepo Dong missile, capped by a satellite, over Japan. The test was
a failure, but the debris landed in the Pacific Ocean not far from
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear early on that Cohen was going to be the
administration's most ardent supporter of building a limited
defensive shield to counter the emerging threat. In January 1999,
when the administration announced it would spend $6.7 billion to
develop and test a system, Cohen bluntly warned that the United
States was prepared to unilaterally withdraw from the Antiballistic
Missile Treaty if the Russians did not agree to amend it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the State Department and the White House quickly
disavowed his warning, but planning for the system went ahead. And
the Pentagon devised a schedule for testing a missile interceptor
that, guided by sophisticated radar stations on the ground and
satellites in space, would crash into incoming ballistic missiles
before they reached American soil.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton's timetable on missile defense grew at least in
part out of desires to protect Gore from Republican attacks that a
Democratic White House was weak on defense, officials conceded.
Republicans had hammered Clinton for not backing a missile shield,
so the president adopted a middle course that would spend millions
on tests while attempting to preserve the current arms control
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   By last fall, the administration agreed that Clinton would make
a decision on whether to deploy the system this summer _ at the
height of the presidential campaign _ based on four criteria: the
system's cost, its technological feasibility, the missile threat
and the impact on national security, particularly on arms control.
</P>
<P>
   The last criteria was key, because Clinton agreed with senior
State Department officials and arms control advocates that the ABM
Treaty was a cornerstone of all arms control. Its prohibitions
against a national missile defense allowed the United States and
Russia to reduce offensive nuclear weapons without fear of losing
their strategic deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made it clear that he would only approve a system if the
administration could reach agreement with the Russians to amend the
treaty, officials said. But any hope of that was dashed last New
Year's Eve when Yeltsin, who had shown considerable flexibility in
dealings with the administration, announced he was stepping down
and named Putin as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   With the Americans proposing to build a missile defense that
many Russians saw as a threat to their last claim to superpower
status, Putin flexed his muscle and drew the line. ``He was going
to make sure the Russian people understood he wasn't going to roll
over for stuff,'' one administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   By last January, Putin's tougher stance was already clear. The
State Department's chief arms-control negotiator, John D. Holum,
presented his Russian counterparts with a detailed proposal for
amending the treaty, while assuring them the system was so limited
that Russia's nuclear arsenal could easily overwhelm it and
obliterate the United States _ thus, in the logic of arms control,
preserving strategic stability.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians brushed the proposal aside, refusing even to call
the talks ``negotiations,'' referring to them merely as
``discussions.'' Holum, Talbott and other officials continued to
hold ``discussions'' with the Russians through the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians never flatly ruled out the possibility of
negotiating amendments _ ``Putin never said nyet,'' the senior
official recalled _ but after Putin was elected president in March,
he began a diplomatic campaign against the American proposals,
driving a deep wedge between the United States and its NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Clinton met with Putin in Moscow in June, American
officials claimed they had made considerable progress in steps
intended to enhance strategic cooperation and security, but the two
leaders barely discussed national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   There was never any question that Clinton would not actually
move ahead unilaterally, as Cohen had suggested in 1999. ``He
didn't want to be the president that killed the ABM treaty,'' one
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the White House asked the administration's lawyers to
see if there was a way initial work on a defensive shield could
begin _ starting with a sophisticated radar at Shemya Island in
Alaska _ without technically violating the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers came up with three opinions, but even those proved
divisive. On July 25, Cohen appeared before the Senate and said the
lawyers had reached a consensus that workers could pour concrete
and lay the rails that would support the radar itself. Such an
interpretation would allow work to continue until 2002 before the
United States would have to notify the Russians of its intent to
withdraw from the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was simply voicing his support for the most liberal
interpretation. There was no consensus, and senior officials at the
State Department and the National Security Council complained that
Cohen's position was overly aggressive and certain to inflame
tensions with Russia and the allies.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the Pentagon and Cohen pushed ahead with a
testing schedule that even some in the military considered overly
compressed and highly risky. But the Pentagon's efforts, too,
suffered setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   After having a successful test in October 1999, proving that it
was possible ``to hit a bullet with a bullet,'' as Clinton said on
Friday, another test in January failed. That put even more pressure
on the test this past July 7, since the administration had said it
would have to have two successful intercepts before it could
approve the program.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of July 7, the interceptor lifted off a launch pad
in Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands and streaked toward a
dummy missile fired from California. But the interceptor's booster
rocket failed to separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that test failed, it pretty much confirmed that the
deployment would be kicked back,'' a senior defense official said.
``We lost the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Cohen and a small circle of aides pressed ahead. They
noted that while the test had failed, other parts of the system,
including the ground-based radar, had worked.
</P>
<P>
   By late July, however, Cohen was alone in making the case that
the system was at least technologically feasible. At the White
House and the State Department, officials had concluded that the
system was nowhere near ready, and meetings to discuss the issue
became increasingly tense. ``We saw the glass as half full,'' one
senior Pentagon official said, ``and they kept saying it was half
empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen first delivered his recommendation to the president more
than a week ago, before Clinton's trip to Nigeria, Tanzania and
Egypt. Administration officials said he argued that contractors
should begin work on the radar station in Shemya, Alaska, leaving
open the possibility of completing a system at the earliest
possible date should the next president _ either Gore or George W.
Bush _ choose to do so.
</P>
<P>
   At no time, officials said, did Cohen betray his loyalty to the
Democratic president, whose aides value at least the appearance of
interagency harmony. ``I think Bill Cohen has been a total mensch
about this at every stage,'' one senior official said, with the
grace of a victor toward a vanquished foe.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Cohen met at the White House on Tuesday with
Clinton, Berger and the president's chief of staff, John Podesta,
the president's mind was made up.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before announcing his decision, Clinton had been
reading a book by the historian Frances Fitzgerald, ``Way Out There
in the Blue,'' visitors to the Oval Office said. The book provides
a sharp critique of the Reagan administration's advocacy of a Star
Wars defense, chronicling the wrenching internal debates that went
on in the 1980s among the State Department, the Pentagon and the
National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told several aides that his administration's debate over
one of the most significant issues in foreign affairs and defense
policy of the time seemed orderly by contrast.

   Sports stories from The New York Times News Service for
 &UR; SUNDAY &LR; , Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times News Service is moving the following articles
today to mark the opening of the National Football League season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NFL PREVIEW &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FBN-DEEP-STRIKE (Undated) _ When Isaac Bruce caught the
game-winning 73-yard touchdown pass in Super Bowl XXXIV, he could
have kept running and zipped right into the 2000 National Football
League season. Because Bruce and his St. Louis Rams, along with
teams like the Minnesota Vikings, the Indianapolis Colts and the
Washington Redskins, are swaying offenses back to the vertical
passing game. The hunger for big plays this season will be
insatiable. And while teams will yearn for big plays to erupt in
the running game, and they will insist on their surfacing in the
passing game. By Thomas George.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-QUARTERBACKS (Undated) _ When the NFL lost John Elway, Dan
Marino and Steve Young to retirement, all in the past two years,
there was concern about who would fill their shoulder pads. But,
surprisingly, there is a healthy surplus of candidates, which is
good news for a league that continues to expand. The number of
solid young passers, more than a dozen, is at its highest level
since 1983, when six quarterbacks were selected in the first round
of the draft. But there is something else happening at the position
besides an increase in young arms. Many of them, like Peyton
Manning and Donovan McNabb, were drafted not only for their
abilities, but also for their capacity to handle the myriad
off-the-field distractions and requests for their time from
increasingly hungry, hostile and intrusive news media and fans. By
Mike Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-AFC (Undated) _ Capsule previews of the AFC teams by
divisions in predicted order of finish. By Thomas George.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-NFC (Undated) _ Capsule previews of the NFC teams by
divisions in predicted order of finish. By Mike Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-ANDERSON-COLUMN (Undated) _ Dave Anderson sports column on
the ``invisible jackals'' pressuring coaches Al Groh and Jim
Fassel. The Jets new head coach Al Groh is replacing Bill Parcells
while Giants coach Fassel has to win to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-NOTEBOOK (Undated) _ Lead item: If there is one troublesome
sign for the Rams _ and there are not very many on a team stacked
with talent _ it is new coach Mike Martz's paranoia and desire to
have Bill Parcells-like control of the media. If Martz loses a few
games, his paranoia will only increase, and players start loosing
confidence in coaches who worry more about who is behind that bush
with a boom microphone than about things that matter like the game
plan. By Mike Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-TV-SPORTS (Undated) _ While the spotlight may be on Dennis
Miller's hiring on ABC's ``Monday Night Football,'' other new faces
will be present for the ``fall feeding feast.'' By Richard
Sandomir.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-COLLINS (Undated) _ The fall of 1998 was a fireball of
strife for Kerry Collins, the quarterback and new field leader of
the New York Giants, a stunning decline from athletic idol to
object of scorn, all crystallized in one early morning meeting in
the office of Carolina Panthers' coach Dom Capers. Capers announced
that Collins had done something unthinkable in sport, he had quit.
Capers no longer discusses the meeting and Collins has never given
his side. But late one afternoon last week, Collins said of that
day: ``As it turned out, it was the best thing that every happened
to me.'' By Bill Pennington.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-JETS (Undated) _ The Jets' regular season begins Sunday
against Green Bay, but the restiveness that accompanied an
offseason of tumult may linger for awhile. An eerily quiet training
camp _ a quiet assured in some part by the trade of receiver
Keyshawn Johnson _ gives way to a season during which the Jets will
be required to solve their mysteries as a team just as surely as
they must solve opposing defenses. Is Vinny Testaverde healthy?
Whither the passing game, now that Johnson is gone? What sort of
imprint will coach Al Groh try to put on the team before the
inevitable looming shadow of Bill Parcells threatens to engulf him?
By Judy Battista.

Cowher, the embattled Steelers coach. By Thomas George.

<P>
   When Isaac Bruce caught the game-winning 73-yard touchdown pass
in Super Bowl XXXIV, he could have kept running and zipped right
into the 2000 NFL season. Because Bruce and his St. Louis Rams,
along with teams like the Minnesota Vikings, the Indianapolis Colts
and the Washington Redskins, are swaying offenses back to the
vertical passing game.
</P>
<P>
   The hunger for big plays this season _ runs of 20 yards or more
and passes of 40 yards or more _ will be insatiable. The intent to
snatch them will be incessant. Teams will yearn for big plays to
erupt in the running game. They will insist on their surfacing in
the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   In the last Super Bowl, the Rams' offense flew and the Tennessee
Titans' offense crept. The Rams gained a 16-0 lead before the
Titans caught them, in part with two seven-minute touchdown drives.
Then one play from Kurt Warner to Bruce, one 73-yard strike, and
St. Louis led. And it won, 23-16, when Tennessee again could not
produce enough big plays, driving instead the length of the field
only to fall a yard short as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   That, as well as the champion Rams' penchant all season for the
vertical game, the big pass play over the top, the deep strike,
left an impression that colors NFL 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a trend there and you see it the more you watch tape
getting ready for the season,'' said Ted Cottrell, defensive
coordinator for the Buffalo Bills. ``It's upfield more with
receivers. They are getting deeper and deeper in their cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   And drastically changing momentum with big plays. ``You can play
great defense and give up three big plays and that's 21 points,''
said Gary Crowton, offensive coordinator for the Chicago Bears.
``Defenses get more comfortable the longer drives go on. Offenses
are responding to that by taking more deep shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Belichick, the New England Patriots' head coach, said that
the desire for big plays ``has always been there, this year, last
year and 10 years before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to go for it,'' he said. ``The question is when
and how? You have to play a complementing game. You've got offense,
defense and special teams, and rarely is a team so dominant in one
area that it makes up for the others. There are very few '85 Bears,
for example, that can win solely with defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Belichick added: ``Definitely, the big play is a killer
because that's the quickest way to score, one shot. I know how
explosive teams like St. Louis and Minnesota are, and it's hard to
play football at that pace. We have a lot of explosive players in
our division, receivers like Eric Moulds in Buffalo and Marvin
Harrison in Indianapolis, who can turn a game in a second. That's
what keeps us up at night. In the end, only two stats matter _
points scored and points given up. And teams not giving up points
don't give up big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Playoff teams and Super Bowl champions, however, make them.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams last season were the only team to reach double digits
in 40-yard-plus passing touchdowns, producing 11. They also led the
league in 40-yard-plus passing completions with 17.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the teams that topped the league in average net yards
per pass play. The Rams led with a 7.73-yard average. Six of the
top 10 teams earned a playoff berth. None of the 10 suffered a
losing record. Conversely, none of the top 10 defenses at limiting
net average yards per pass play suffered a losing record and six of
them made the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast offense _ short, crisp, timing patterns, hitch
tosses to receivers and flares to backs in the flat _ has been the
league's favored attack in recent years. It was an answer to
all-out blitzes that helped negate the vertical game, which usually
requires maximum pass protection, a deeper quarterback drop and the
quarterback holding the ball longer. Defenses have responded by
moving closer to the line of scrimmage, taking away the underneath
passes, placing linebackers and safeties on the flanks to negate
the flares. Defenses have crept closer and closer.
</P>
<P>
   Offenses want them to back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defenses are really challenging you, and it's getting
congested,'' said Kevin Gilbride, offensive coordinator for the
Pittsburgh Steelers. ``They are taking away more and more of the
short game. Now, you can still run whatever you want as your base
offense, but you've got to go vertical more frequently now to free
your offense. It's the game.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   This is amusing to Al Davis, the Oakland Raiders' owner.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 71, has been a coach, a commissioner and an owner in pro
football. Before Bill Walsh perfected the West Coast offense, Don
Coryell perfected timing passing. Before Coryell was Sid Gillman's
zany blend of short and deep passing.
</P>
<P>
   For 35 years, however, Davis has been connected to the vertical
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think we started it _ the deep strike,'' Davis
said. ``Ours was done with power running and the combination would
put fear and pressure on the opponent. It was not about location,
scheme and personnel. You were not going to stop us from going
deep. You had to prove it on the field. We had games going in, one
in '68 against the Jets and Weeb Ewbank, where he said, above all
else, they were going to stop us from going deep. But it was what
we wanted to do and what we did do. They knew where we were. We
knew where they were. They didn't stop us.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for the vertical game to work, you have to have one
focal point for the defense to consider, a receiver with tremendous
speed. You'd like to be at least above 50 percent. You'd like to
avoid interceptions and have a good yards-per-catch average. But
what I cared about most were touchdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Raiders in recent seasons have concentrated less on
the vertical game, it will always be a part of their offense, Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deep ball is back, no question,'' he said. ``And one of
the reasons why is you have a new group of quarterbacks whose game
is more suited to throw the football upfield. You know, Tennessee
last year used power running, took shots once in a while, had a
quarterback who ran the ball well and used clock management. The
vertical game? They were not willing to do it. But I think Steve
McNair can do it. Most of the young quarterbacks in here now can do
it. And he can probably do it the best of the young ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will not have a vertical game unless that coach wants to
do it and is willing to do it. Bill Parcells had that great defense
with the Giants and ran the ball and won a couple of Super Bowls
that way. But when he came back to coaching, even he had to get out
of that rut. Nowadays, you have to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the leading coaches in today's vertical game include
Dennis Green of Minnesota, Brian Billick of Baltimore, Dan Reeves
of Atlanta and Mike Martz of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to kid Mike Holmgren and Ron Wolf in Green Bay about
their 15-yard wall,'' Davis said. ``I would tell them to throw the
ball past that imaginary wall they've set up. And then when they
won a Super Bowl, what got them started was a deep strike to
Antonio Freeman. Wolf later told me he was thinking of me when that
play happened. The first time I met Mike Martz was after the last
Super Bowl and I told him what he was doing was great. Keep
breaking down that wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best vertical game combinations Davis has seen are
the Jets' Joe Namath to Don Maynard, the Chiefs' Len Dawson to Otis
Taylor, the Rams' Norm Van Brocklin to Tom Fears, the Cowboys' Don
Meredith to Bob Hayes, and the Steelers' Terry Bradshaw to Lynn
Swann and John Stallworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This league has always been more interested in explosion on
offense,'' Davis said. ``Every rule change I can remember is
predicated first on safety and then to increase the offense. The
vertical game is back now and elements of it will always be here.
Defenses must know that whether on first, second or third down you
have to play the deep ball or you are going to get beat. A true
vertical game will not let location, design or scheme dictate you.
You take the deep strike. A lot of it boils down to the guy calling
the play. He has to have the will to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams certainly exude that type of moxie. ``We are what we
are _ a team that will not hold back whether we are on your 4-yard
line or on our own,'' Martz said. ``We made a commitment to that
last season and you will see it again this season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams toss a variety of big-play schemes at opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This offense was put together with the idea of throwing so
many weapons at a defense and stretching defenses from sidelines to
end zones that they become too thin,'' said Kurt Warner, the Rams'
quarterback and the Most Valuable Player of the Super Bowl. ``When
you put pressure on cornerbacks and safeties to defend the deep
ball, and you keep putting that pressure on them, you're working on
their minds. The big play is the one thing they fear and want to
defend most. When you get it, you break down the defense in a way
that not only shows up on the scoreboard but also in their
psyche.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills' Cottrell said that of recent Super Bowl champions,
the Rams receivers and passing game ranked among the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rams, my goodness, those guys on the outside really fly up
the field,'' Cottrell said. ``And they have a back in Marshall
Faulk that keeps you honest in defending the running game, which is
something an offense needs for the big play. That helps make it
click for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shanahan, the Broncos' coach, has studied the Rams closely.
Denver plays at St. Louis Monday night in the teams' season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have Torry Holt, Isaac Bruce and Az-Zahir Hakim, three
receivers who can go deep or catch a 5-yard hitch pass and turn it
into a long route,'' Shanahan said. ``Not every team has that kind
of explosiveness and tries to get the big play from the quick dump,
the catch and run. You need that home-run player, the skill of a
Holt or a Bruce, and that's what people are looking for. It's about
playing aggressive and taking chances.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however: ``It's about balance, though. Because if all
you do is throw the ball downfield, you won't be coaching in the
NFL very long. You'll be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what makes the vertical game risky, Walsh, the former
San Francisco 49ers coach and current team vice president, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be interesting to watch for the year _ can you drop
back and throw the ball deep downfield and waste a down if you
don't get it?'' Walsh said. ``I'm for it. Our deep game was Jerry
Rice and John Taylor catching the short ball and running with it.
If you don't have receivers like that, you've got to find another
way to go deep and put pressure on the defense. But is your offense
capable of making a first down when you don't complete the deep,
vertical pass? That's the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Manning, the Colts' quarterback, said the vertical game
required especially effective pass protection. He said one of the
best ways the Colts set up their vertical game was by running the
big pass play off patterns already run in a game; for example, a
10-yard out pass will be run three times and on the fourth time
becomes an up route. The Colts love to run off-tackle repeatedly
and then play-fake and throw deep. They were second last season to
the Rams in average net yards per pass play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be persistent in creating big plays,'' Manning
said. ``If you seek them, though, they come. For a quarterback,
especially early in the game, the big play is a great momentum
lifter and it gets the entire team going.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Porcher, a dominating defensive end for Detroit, said the
Lions' defense talked about preventing big plays in training camp
and each week during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can put you in a hole that you somehow never get out of,''
Porcher said of an offense's big plays. ``Guys like myself make a
living by trying to get to that quarterback and keep them from
happening. Our division is where the vertical game lives. Randy
Moss in Minnesota starts it, and other receivers like Marcus
Robinson in Chicago, Antonio Freeman in Green Bay and now Keyshawn
Johnson in Tampa Bay will keep it going. We've got Herman Moore and
Germane Crowell and Johnnie Morton and they create chaos and big
plays. This entire league has a lot of gunslinging quarterbacks who
can throw it downfield and receivers who can go catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   For defenses this season, combating the vertical game is all
about pressuring the quarterback, safeties who can cover vast areas
and sure tackling in the open field.
</P>
<P>
   For offenses, it is all about will, intent and shoving defenses
back with more vertical passing.
</P>
<P>
   It's the game.

FOR NEW WAVE OF QUARTERBACKS, NEW PRESSURES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The place to be for two days this summer was Hawaii, not because
of the sandy beaches and the sunsets, but because some of the best
young quarterbacks in the NFL were competing in the Quarterback
Challenge, a sort of ``Survivor'' for passers. The sexiest event,
by far, was the long-distance throw.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the throwers lined up like gunslingers readying for
a shootout. Peyton Manning of Indianapolis and Jake Plummer, the
scrambler from Arizona, each threw his pass 69 yards. Cade McNown,
the Chicago Bears' quarterback, and Donovan McNabb of Philadelphia
did even better, each tossing for 72 yards. Eventually, McNown and
McNabb faced off in the finals. That's when the Eagles quarterback
with the big arm blew away his competition.
</P>
<P>
   McNown's throw went a healthy 69 yards. Then came McNabb's pass,
and it sailed, and sailed and sailed, landing 76 yards downfield.
The other quarterbacks, who are accustomed to making fans gawk at
their plays, were themselves taken aback at McNabb's raw power.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight year, Plummer won the overall challenge,
beating out older veterans like Atlanta's Chris Chandler,
Washington's Brad Johnson and San Diego's Jim Harbaugh. But it was
McNabb who caught everyone's attention with his moon shot.
</P>
<P>
   After the event, McNabb looked at the other young quarterbacks
and felt a twinge of satisfaction at being part of what can only be
called a quarterback renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cade and I were having fun, cracking jokes on one another,''
McNabb remembered, standing recently at his locker in Veterans
Stadium. ``Then we said to each other: `Here are two young guys,
with all these other young quarterbacks. We should take a picture.
It might be worth something one day.'''
</P>
<P>
   When the NFL lost John Elway, Dan Marino and Steve Young to
retirement, all in the past two years, there was concern about who
would fill their shoulder pads. But, surprisingly, there is a
healthy surplus of candidates, which is good news for a league that
continues to expand.
</P>
<P>
   The number of solid young passers, more than a dozen, is at its
highest level since 1983, when Elway, Marino, Ken O'Brien, Jim
Kelly, Tony Eason and Todd Blackledge were selected in the first
round of the draft. It is impossible to tell how many from this
recent group, most drafted over the past two seasons, will be Pro
Bowlers or Pro Busts, but early indications are that a good number
of them may be on their way to having productive careers.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something else happening at the position besides an
increase in young arms. Many of them, like Manning and McNabb, were
drafted not only for their abilities, but also for their capacity
to handle the myriad off-the-field distractions and requests for
their time from increasingly hungry, hostile and intrusive news
media and fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers of good quarterbacks is extremely high,'' said
Ernie Accorsi, general manager of the Giants. ``Teams want talent
at that position and that has always been the case and always will
be. But there is some truth to the fact that teams are now looking
for quarterbacks who can also handle what is a more complex game
and a more complex society than it was 30 or 20 or even 10 years
ago.''

</P>
<P>
   Personnel directors point to Ryan Leaf as a prime example of
what can happen when talent is the sole focus. Coming out of
Washington State in 1998, Leaf was considered the player with the
best physical skills, but the Chargers ignored signs of his
immaturity. Leaf is trying to turn his career around and will start
this season for the Chargers, but has proved incapable of
consistently handling the pressure of being in the spotlight. He
owns a career quarterback rating of 39, has been fined by the team
for insubordination and has alienated his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis wanted Manning over Leaf, in part because the Colts
believed Manning's maturity _ which Bill Polian, the general
manager, called ``almost unparalleled for someone his age'' _ was
as great an asset as his precision throws.
</P>
<P>
   For a quarterback in Philadelphia, maturity and thick skin are
needed as much as a helmet. McNabb is trying to win over what is
generally considered the nastiest group of fans in sports. Few
local sports heroes, including Randall Cunningham, Mike Schmidt,
Eric Lindros and Allen Iverson, have been able to quell the
often-overwhelming, sometimes vicious negativity of Philadelphia
fans consistently.
</P>
<P>
   When McNabb was drafted in April 1999, Eagles fans at Madison
Square Garden lustily booed the pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely is,'' McNabb said when asked if Philadelphia was
the toughest city to play in. ``I look at it as you just focus on
your job and try to be as productive as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've booed Santa Claus. They've booed Mike Schmidt. They've
booed Curt Schilling. I know the whole deal. They booed Randall
Cunningham. I just have to play my game, and if they boo, just deal
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   So McNabb is one of football's young guns, but he is also part
of a greater experiment, with Philadelphia serving as the petri
dish. Can a player who was drafted as much for his calm temperament
as his talent survive in a city that is already trying to drain him
of those positive attributes? Will Philadelphia give McNabb a
chance to grow or run him out of town?
</P>
<P>
   The other young quarterbacks, as promising as McNabb, are being
allowed to develop in relatively benign circumstances. After only
two seasons, scouts are calling Manning one of the best talents
ever. Tampa Bay's Shaun King led the Buccaneers to the NFC
championship game last season. Steve McNair took Tennessee to the
Super Bowl, where Kurt Warner was named the game's most valuable
player.
</P>
<P>
   Akili Smith in Cincinnati, Charlie Batch in Detroit, Tim Couch
in Cleveland, Daunte Culpepper in Minnesota, Matt Hasselbeck in
Green Bay, Brian Griese in Denver, Jonathan Quinn in Jacksonville,
Chris Redman in Baltimore, Chad Pennington with the Jets, Tee
Martin in Pittsburgh and New England's Michael Bishop, who might
run the option in goal-line situations this year, round out a solid
group of prospects. The average age of these players: 24 years old.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, five quarterbacks were drafted in the first round and
one in the second. A year before that, seven quarterbacks total
were picked.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if all of the young players have what it takes to
make it in the NFL, Manning said, ``I think a lot of young players
are being thrown right into the fire and I believe they can handle
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can handle the pressure,'' said Vikings coach Dennis
Green, who drafted Culpepper in 1999 and named him the starter this
season, ``but they have it tougher than most quarterbacks in the
past because so much is expected of them so soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL quarterback, circa 2000, is asked to be superhuman. He
is asked to win not in five years or three, but fewer. He is asked
to digest offenses and defenses that are more complicated than
ever. He is expected to throw the ball farther, harder and more
accurately than quarterbacks past.
</P>
<P>
   After the practices and games, he must handle the live hook-up
with CNN, Fox and ESPN, not to mention a radio spot or two with a
24-hour sports station. Was Joe Montana ever asked to do an
Internet chat early in his career?
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that an NFL quarterback in decades past had
it easy. Now, improved medical technology helps players recover
from injuries faster, rules protect quarterbacks from vicious hits,
and salaries are in the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Elway said recently that he had sympathy for today's
young quarterbacks because ``there are many more pressures on them
now than when I first got into the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The league's largest sympathy vote must go to McNabb, who has
not only carried himself with poise as the Eagles' future franchise
player at quarterback, but has also handled the huge amount of
off-field responsibilities and kept his head amid the league's most
abusive fans.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb seems the perfect fit. At Syracuse he evolved into one of
the best athletes in college football. But along with physical
prowess, the 6-foot-2-inch, 226-pound McNabb was known as one of
the most well-rounded players to attend the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows about his arm, and the way he can run with the
ball,'' said Eagles wide receiver Charles Johnson, who has become
close friends with McNabb, ``but what few people know is how high
his maturity level is.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought it was tough to be a young quarterback
today McNabb, who is black, responded bluntly, ``Being a young
black quarterback is a lot more pressure than just being a young
quarterback.'' He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a tough situation because in football the past few
years we haven't won very many games,'' McNabb said of the Eagles.
``I just want to win. I'm going to keep the outside away from the
locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, McNabb experienced the growing pains of a rookie,
throwing eight touchdown passes along with seven interceptions, but
he still beat the division champion, Washington, and the Super Bowl
winner, St. Louis, for two of the Eagles' five victories.
</P>
<P>
   This year, McNabb has taken steps, on and off the field, to
improve. In the locker room he has established himself as the clear
leader, socializing with players at every position, a feat few
Eagles starting quarterbacks in the past accomplished. McNabb is
host of his own television and radio shows, something many
high-profile quarterbacks in big markets do. It will make his life
more hectic, but it is a good way to state his case directly to
hardened Eagles fans without a media filter.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, he has improved his accuracy, to the point that he
has leapfrogged fellow young throwers like Couch and McNown. During
the Eagles' preseason game against Tennessee, McNabb completed 15
of 23 passes for 163 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions _
in the first half. He also ran for 43 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a bright future ahead of him,'' Titans coach Jeff
Fisher said. ``He's got a strong arm, he's got nice touch and he
showed he's got some scrambling ability.''
</P>
<P>
   If McNabb can continue his growth as a player, and pair those
skills with his pleasant personality, he could become one of the
league's biggest stars, in one of the NFL's harshest towns. ``But I
have to keep growing,'' McNabb said, ``and keep proving I can excel
at this game.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TWO COACHES ON THE SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As they prowl the sideline, Al Groh and Jim Fassel will each be
surrounded by invisible jackals for different reasons: Groh in his
first year as the New York Jets' coach, Fassel in what could be his
last year as the New York Giants' coach.
</P>
<P>
   With any other franchise, Groh would be given the benefit of the
doubt that every rookie head coach receives, at least at the start.
But as Bill Parcells' successor, he will be judged differently. He
must maintain the level of excellence that Parcells established
after all those Jets seasons of frustration under so many other
uninspiring coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Groh has the opportunity to be Parcells' first successful
successor. Ray Handley flopped with the Giants. Pete Carroll was
eventually dismissed by the New England Patriots, prompting Bill
Belichick's hiring there after spurning his Jets contract as
Parcells' successor.
</P>
<P>
   Groh knows the trouble he's in. He was on the Giants' staff in
1991 when Handley was named to succeed Parcells, who had suddenly
left the Giants after their Super Bowl XXV victory. Handley, who
had been an impressive running-backs coach, had never been a head
coach; not in college, not in high school. And as the Giants' head
coach, he was a bust.
</P>
<P>
   Handley's tenure opened with an exciting 16-14 Monday night
victory over the San Francisco 49ers, but those Giants struggled to
an 8-8 record that season, then drifted to 6-10 before he was
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Groh, who had been the Wake Forest head coach for six seasons,
spent only that one season on Handley's staff. In 1992, he was
Belichick's defensive coordinator with the Cleveland Browns before
rejoining Parcells in New England in 1993 and then going to the
Jets with him in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever principles bound our operation together when Bill was
the Giants' coach,'' Groh said of the reaction to Handley's
takeover, ``Ray departed from those principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Handley simply could not ``lead the pack'' as a head coach. He
was not decisive enough, not tough enough, not stern enough. All
the Giants' players soon realized it. Handley was the substitute
teacher the students didn't respect. He was everything that Groh
now knows he cannot be as Parcells' third successor.
</P>
<P>
   Handley's mistake was trying to do things his way instead of
trying to continue to do it the Parcells way.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Groh wisely wants to do things the Parcells way. If
only because the Jets' nucleus is accustomed to the Parcells way.
But it won't be easy, especially on defense. For the previous three
seasons, the assistant head coach, Belichick, the linebacker coach,
Groh, and the line coach, Romeo Crenel (now with the Cleveland
Browns), put together the defensive game plans.
</P>
<P>
   But now Belichick and Crenel are elsewhere, Groh is the head
coach and Parcells, as the director of football operations, is no
longer directly involved in supervising the defensive thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mike Nolan, the Redskins' defensive coordinator the
last three years and the Giants' defensive coordinator for four
years before that, is the Jets' new guru. Ray Hamilton is still the
defensive line coach, but Bob Sutton, from Army, is now in charge
of the linebackers, and Todd Boles, from Grambling, tutors the
defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   Boles has three Super Bowl rings as a defensive back (two with
the Redskins, one with the 49ers), but as an NFL assistant coach,
he's a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   At least for now, the Jets' experienced defensive players are
more familiar with the Jets' defensive philosophy than the new
assistant coaches.
</P>
<P>
   In other years, whenever Parcells moved from the Giants to New
England and then to the Jets, he took virtually his entire staff
with him. As he often explained, ``I didn't want to have to coach
the coaches,'' meaning new assistant coaches. But on the Jets now,
Groh will be coaching some coaches.
</P>
<P>
   How well the Jets do this season might depend on how well Groh
coaches those coaches as much as on how well he coaches the
players.
</P>
<P>
   As for Fassel, his return will depend on the Giants moving in
what Ernie Accorsi, their general manager, called ``the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi remembered Dick Vermeil insisting that the St. Louis
Rams, despite a 4-12 record in 1998, were moving in the right
direction. And as the reigning Super Bowl champions now, the Rams
obviously were. But under Fassel the last three seasons, the Giants
have been moving in reverse: 9-7 (and a wild-card playoff loss),
then 8-8, then 7-9 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Another unfulfilling season and Fassel won't fulfill his
one-year contract extension through the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   If the road to the Super Bowl goes through the X-ray room for
every contender, the road to Fassel's return could go through the
X-ray room too. The Giants' depth, especially on the offensive
line, is skimpy.
</P>
<P>
   Even if healthy, the Giants look no better than 8-8, but the
Jets, if healthy, could go 9-7 and steal a wild card.
</P>
<P>
   And if Peyton Manning stays healthy, the Indianapolis Colts will
outscore the Redskins, 35-27, in Super Bowl XXXV.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kate Shanley and Humberto Lopez met in a nightclub
with starfish on the walls and a pulsing Latin beat in the air.
They caught each other's eye immediately _ she of the long blond
hair, white pants and rabbit fur top; he of the orange shirt and
handsome dark looks.
</P>
<P>
   A song was starting and he asked her to dance. She said yes and
they locked bodies in the semidarkness.
</P>
<P>
   Then they bumped knees. Then they pulled in different
directions. Then the song became interminable. When it was over,
they hung out together but did not dance again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a total mess,'' said Lopez, 23, a waiter from Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a disaster,'' agreed Shanley, 44, an
advertising sales representative who is also from Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Shanley was dancing '`on 2,'' known as New York-style mambo, in
which the first long step comes on the second beat and there are no
pauses. Lopez was dancing ``on 1,'' the style favored by many mambo
dancers in which the first long step comes on the first beat, and
the dancers pause on the fourth and the eighth beats.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter occurred two months ago in Miami, but it could
have taken place on any dance floor in any Latin club these days.
Call it the mambo wars.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers on the 1 beat say they follow the melody, dancers on the
2 the percussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are that one beat off, you're not in sync,'' said
Shanley, who has since taught Lopez ``on 2.'' ``I try to just
follow, but when that happens, you try to get the guy to come to
your timing. But if he can't, you have to stay wherever he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Going out dancing did not use to be such a hassle. But salsa
dancing _ as mambo is often known today _ is hotter than ever,
surpassing even the craze of the 1950s. Cultural historians
attribute the resurgent popularity in part to globalization and the
Internet. And with the wider appeal has come a new zeal to dance
well. In New York, dance studios report record enrollment in salsa
classes, higher than that for tango or swing in major studios like
DanceSport in Manhattan. And many more dancers are learning the
``on 2, '' the style that old-timers recall as a favorite during
the heyday of Palladium in the 1950s and of the Mambo King himself,
Tito Puente, who died on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of salsa Web sites, international dance
performance tours and even an annual world salsa ``congress'' the
style has been spreading to cities like Los Angeles and Chicago and
abroad, to countries like Italy and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But as the 2s run into the 1s, a night out can turn into a
pressure cooker. In many Latin clubs in New York, the dancers _
white, black, Asian, Hispanic _ come from many different cultures,
but what separates them is not ethnicity, but the beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go to clubs to get rid of stress, but now there's more
stress on the dance floor than at work,'' said Eddie Torres, a
longtime New York mambo instructor who is widely recognized as a
master of ``on 2.'' ``You go to clubs and it's like the Olympics of
salsa. It's not a healthy competition. There are girls who tell me
that a partner would try to give them a class in the middle of the
dance floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Reyes, 26, an electronics technician, was clinging to his
``on 1'' kin on a recent Wednesday night on the first floor of
Nell's, on West 14th Street in Manhattan that has ``Cuban Soul''
nights once a week.
</P>
<P>
   The ``on 2'' aficionados were in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Reyes said, he ventured into ``on 2'' territory only to be
told by a woman that he did not know how to dance. ``It's just the
opposite,'' he insisted. ``I can't dance like that. They're from
the dance studios. It's more cabaret, more show. That dance has
been created for Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   The upside is that there is a good deal of great dancing going
on. At clubs like the Latin Quarter and the Copacabana in
Manhattan, ``on 2'' dancers are easy to spot: their style is
skillful and flashy, with men spinning women like tops and partners
separating every now and then to show off fancy footwork known as
``shines.''
</P>
<P>
   But some couples look like clones of one another. And many ``on
2'' dancers will not dance with just anyone. In this subculture,
dancers often take classes every week. They hold socials where no
alcohol is served. They even have their own Web site,
SalsaNewYork.com, which lists dance events and includes ``on 2''
dancers in an e-mailing list only ``as long as this is their
preferred and dominant way of dancing to salsa.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Rapoport, 34, Web master of Salsaweb.com, a popular salsa
Web site, knows and appreciates both styles. ``As soon as you start
learning moves, dancing becomes another world,'' he explained .
``It becomes much more athletic, more exciting, and you want to do
that with people who dance at your level.'' Good looks are no
longer enough to entice a man across the dance floor. At a club
once, Rapoport said, he had to vouch for a girlfriend's competence
as an ``on 2'' dancer before one of his male friends would dance
with her, ``and she was very attractive!''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the competition, there are those who say on 1 and on 2
are like vanilla and chocolate ice cream, both delicious.
</P>
<P>
   But with salsa dancing, a swirl is out of the question for Steve
and Elyse Montiel, a married couple who live in California and have
taken private salsa lessons.
</P>
<P>
   One instructor's diagnosis: she danced on 1, he danced on 2.
</P>
<P>
   Montiel, 44, a fund-raising consultant, calls it
``irreconcilable differences.'' She tries to follow her 52-year-old
husband, she said, but her natural inclination keeps getting in the
way.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We start together,'' she said, describing a typical excursion
to the dance floor. ``I get frustrated. Then we dance by ourselves.
Then I feel guilty. Then we dance together again.'' Montiel's take
on the problem: ``We both lead.'' Dancers, of course, could dance
both styles. But ``on 1'' dancers who learn to dance ``on 2''
usually become converts. Many say they find ``on 2'' more engaging,
more challenging. Some call it more authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``To dance on 2 is really going back to Africa because it's
dancing to the drums,'' said Neyda Martinez, 36, a publicist and
arts consultant. ``To me, on the 1 is for only listening to the top
layer of the music. It's more melodic. But the dancing on the 2 is
really on the African beat.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``on 1'' dancers say they are just as hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music on the one is very strong for me. You feel it
more,'' said Luis Vazquez, 28, a dance instructor in Los Angeles,
who travels internationally with his five-year-old performing
group, Salsa Brava.
</P>
<P>
   It is also less contrived, he argued. ``Nobody can really hear
the 2, somebody has to teach you to listen to the percussion. On
one you just hear the music, like when you clap, you start clapping
on the one.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, having lived through the 1970s when dancers abandoned
salsa for the hustle in droves, finds the new interest gratifying.
Torres and his wife and dance partner, Maria, now teach about 600
students each week at their studios in Manhattan and the Bronx, six
times as many as a decade years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are other salsa dancing styles besides the 1 and the 2,
but Torres said these two are popular because '`on 1'' one is easy
to learn and `on 2'' is better suited to the ``clave,'' the
rhythmic pattern at the heart of salsa music.
</P>
<P>
   Torres said that the main difference between the two styles is
that ``on 1'' dancing has a pause in the 4/4 time structure of the
basic salsa step that is absent when dancing on 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tito Puente didn't recognize ``on 1'' for the mambo,'' Torres,
50, said. ``He used to say, who has seen music pause? The body
shouldn't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent, said he
``naturally fell on the 2'' when he started dancing as a young boy
and for years he danced without paying attention to breaking down
the steps, like many Latinos do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be asked, do you dance on 2?,'' he recalled. ``And I'd
say, ``on two feet?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1977, a friend who taught ballroom dancing asked him to
put a count to his ``street'' on 2 style, which is different from
another ``on 2'' style taught in ballroom classes.
</P>
<P>
   But Torres regrets that technique has come at the expense of
some spontaneity. ``The more technique, the more you leave the
jungle,'' he said. ``I used to do crazy things while dancing and
I'd ask myself, what got into me?''
</P>
<P>
   But for the salsa dancers who are trying to cope with the
different styles, it is a jungle out there.
</P>
<P>
   At Nell's last week, Arthur Rutledge, was left to do some steps
on his own from the sidelines downstairs after being turned down by
a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked a lady to dance and she said no and I don't know if
it's because she doesn't know how to dance or because she has a
different style,'' the 25-year-old model said.
</P>
<P>
   At La Maganette, a restaurant on Third Avenue in Manhattan that
has a live salsa music on Wednesdays and attracts an older crowd,
Carlos Arroyo, an ``on 2'' dancer, assessed the couples around him
and easily picked out those dancing on 1.
</P>
<P>
   How, he was asked. ``They're dancing off beat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo said he tells women the same, if warranted, ``and I pull
them back to my style.''
</P>
<P>
   But many people do not care to define their dancing in any
particular way. Leonardo Wignall, 60, a regular at Nell's and a
Cuban who came to this country in 1980, said that the Afro-Cuban
rhythms from which salsa derives have too many elements to dance
them any one way. You would not dance a rumba the way you dance a
son montuno or a guaracha, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you listen to the orchestra it tells you what to dance,''
he said. ``But they don't listen,'' he said of most dancers. ``The
rhythm changes and they keep dancing the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some others note that many of today's dancers are missing
the point. Whatever happened to trying to adjust to each other's
rhythm, to men who strove to make the women feel good, asked Paul
Pellicoro, owner of DanceSport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object is to make your partner feel in heaven,'' he said.
``Ask the old-timers.''

MARTZ FINDS PLENTY TO FEED PARANOIA EVEN BEFORE SEASON BEGINS; MORE
JOHNSON ANALYSIS; LEAF WATCHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When an NFL assistant suddenly becomes a head coach, two things
usually happen: First, his blood pressure skyrockets. Second, he
becomes more paranoid than Richard Nixon. We don't know about the
blood pressure of Mike Martz, who this off-season replaced Dick
Vermeil as head coach of the Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams,
but we do know that on the paranoid scale Martz is already scoring
off the chart.
</P>
<P>
   It's football season when the leaves start changing color,
players break out the cliches, and coaches start talking about
strangers on a hill possibly spying on their practice.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in the middle of a Rams practice, Martz saw two
people on a hillside warehouse near the practice field. Martz sent
the team's security director, Dan Linza, to chase them away. Then
Martz ordered Linza to walk the length of the large warehouse _
twice _ to see if anyone else was watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm paranoid, like all coaches are paranoid,'' Martz said.
``You have people watching with a notepad, or a camera, somehow it
makes you paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   But the paranoia did not stop there. During that same practice,
a newspaper photographer took several photos of safety Keith Lyle,
something even the tense Vermeil allowed. This time, the team asked
the photographer to stop. When the photographer later tried to make
a call on his cell phone, a Rams official threatened to take away
the phone. Maybe the official was worried that the photographer's
calling plan was too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Then, late in the week, the Rams moved their practices from the
wide-open field at Rams Park to the more secure _ and enclosed _
Trans World Dome. The team said it was because of temperatures in
the mid-90s, but since when do coaches fret over players getting
hot? Maybe Martz thought the Denver Broncos, the team St. Louis
plays on Monday night, were using spy satellites.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one troublesome sign for the Rams _ and there are
not very many on a team that is stacked with talent _ it is Martz's
paranoia and desire to have Bill Parcells-like control of the news
media. Vermeil could be uptight, but he learned how to loosen up,
and his players appreciated it. If Martz loses a few games, his
paranoia may only increase, and players could start to lose
confidence in coaches who worry more about who is behind that bush
with a boom microphone than about things that matter like, oh, the
game plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Case of the Two People on the Hill _ sounds like a Perry
Mason episode _ exemplifies the extremes some normally sane people
can reach in the pressure cooker that is professional football.
</P>
<P>
   One team spying on another has happened, but it is rare, mainly
because the secrets that can be uncovered are not really secrets.
Teams know each other too well.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the more paranoid coaches believe spying is rampant and
will go to extremes to stop it, even though it is mostly in their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, New York is purportedly one of the more legendary
spying hot spots. Giants coaches from Parcells to Dan Reeves to Jim
Fassel believed at various times that opponents stashed spies in
rooms at a hotel near Route 3, across from one of the Giants'
practice fields. With a good pair of high-powered binoculars, a
spy, theoretically, could see everything.
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants built a practice bubble several years ago,
Reeves moved the team inside so often because of his fear of being
spied on, that one player used to jokingly call the facility
``Dan's bunker.''
</P>
<P>
   Some teams are now even spying on themselves. The Jets have
installed video cameras throughout the facility, which, the team
says, help protect players and others from theft. But players
believe that video cameras in the locker and weight rooms are used
solely to monitor their activities and show which players speak to
the news media.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Redskins this summer became the first team to
charge fans a $10 admission fee to watch training camp practices,
and the policy kicked in a never-before-used league rule that
allows scouts, normally prevented from legally watching another
team's practice, to set up camp. Dozens, notepads in hand, braved
the humidity to watch Washington's players.
</P>
<P>
   This time the spying was legal. Still, interestingly, several
scouts who attended the practices said they felt they were doing
something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   So Martz joins a long list of James Bond, spy-catching wannabes.
Only Martz is not trying to protect queen and country. He just
wants to make sure a bunch of football secrets, or perceived
secrets, stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   MORE JOHNSON ANALYSIS
</P>
<P>
   Yet one more annoying Keyshawn Johnson item _ and we cannot
promise this will be the last.
</P>
<P>
   A former salary-cap consultant for the New Orleans Saints, Terry
O'Neil, who in three years helped the Saints' salary-cap room grow
from $11,000 to $17 million, made two interesting claims recently
regarding Johnson, the former Jets star, on his new football Web
site, RealNFL.com.
</P>
<P>
   First, O'Neil reports _ and the Jets do not deny _ that General
Manager Bill Parcells tried to trade Johnson as early as 1998, in
order to recoup draft picks given to New England in the Curtis
Martin trade. O'Neil bases this on conversations with team
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Second, O'Neil said the Jets could have easily fit Johnson under
the team's salary cap for a measly cap number of $38,500 a season
for two years without destroying the team's financial future.
</P>
<P>
   How? His explanation is complicated, but basically it involved
paying Johnson a signing bonus two years in advance of his
contract's expiration date while simultaneously lowering his base
salary for this year and next. One team's salary-cap guru said
O'Neil's analysis was correct.
</P>
<P>
   If it is, then the statements by Parcells that Johnson had to be
traded for salary cap reasons are untrue. O'Neil's statements seem
to bolster Johnson's claims that the true reason Parcells traded
him was because the organization feared Johnson and coach Al Groh
would not get along.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are not commenting on O'Neil's number crunching or his
statement that the team attempted to trade Johnson two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   LEAF WATCHERS
</P>
<P>
   When San Diego quarterback Ryan Leaf starts Sunday against
Oakland, the coaches and players will be watching for two things.
Leaf has never been able to handle adversity, so the team wants to
see how Leaf reacts after an interception or a sack.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers will also look to see how Leaf handles pain. In the
past, he has been accused of being soft, and that is an area where
he has lost a tremendous amount of respect among his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   If players are going to trust Leaf again, they must see him take
a hit, then get right back up and go on to the next play, not take
himself out of the game with what players might consider minor
pain.

DISCARDED HINDU GOD DOES NOT BLESS INDIA'S WATER 
</HEADLINE>
  By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ The Hindu god Ganesh _ bestower of happiness and
eliminator of sorrow _ is a hard man to miss in a crowd. He has
four arms and the head of an elephant. His pot belly is Sumo-sized.
He fully indulges his fondness for gold jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, there was no missing him Friday, at the start of
Bombay's annual Ganesh Festival. Tens of thousands of brightly
painted statues of the long-trunked deity were carried through the
streets, then put in honored places in private homes or elaborate
outdoor shrines. Most of these plaster-of-Paris idols are small,
less than knee-high, but some stand a stunning 20 feet or more.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is a 10-day celebration, with as much partying as
prayer, but this year more than the monsoon will try to rain on any
parades. Nothing against Ganesh himself, but environmentalists do
not like the way the event traditionally ends, with the icons
disposed of in a ceremonial immersion, ``returned to nature'' by
leaving them to disintegrate in lakes, creeks and the conveniently
located Arabian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within 24 hours you get massive fish deaths from the toxins in
the paint,'' said Bittu Sahgal, editor of Sanctuary Asia, an
environmental magazine published here. ``The sentiment is pure but
the reality is polluted. All that plaster forms an impermeable
layer on the water's bottom so that organisms can't breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest share of the used Ganeshes is immersed along
Chowpatty Beach. It is a gargantuan and joyous spectacle, with
500,000 people passing through, many of them wading into the water,
gods in hand.
</P>
<P>
   But a day later, at low tide, the beach looks like a hideous
battlefield. Beheaded and dismembered Ganeshes lie marooned in the
shallows.
</P>
<P>
   Scavengers and city workers pick up what they can. ``Frankly,
it's a very sad sight,'' said Kedar Gore, the education officer of
the World Wide Fund for Nature _ India. The group has issued an
``urgent appeal'' against immersion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious damage is being done to the sea floor,'' Gore said
sternly.
</P>
<P>
   So far, these entreaties have been so much incense in the wind,
a disregarded blasphemy, something akin to asking Americans to quit
chopping down evergreens at Christmas time. Immersion is considered
an important rite, a reverent way to dispose of the inanimate
statue after Ganesh's spirit has moved on.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists admit they have a tough, and perhaps
impossible, cause to sell. Besides, Bombay's problems with
pollution go far beyond remnant Ganeshes.
</P>
<P>
   This is India's financial center, with 12 million to 14 million
people packed so tightly they are almost fastened. Magnificent
high-rises tower above some of the world's biggest slums. There is
enough traffic to turn a crosstown drive into a two-hour trip.
Factories feed the sea a buffet of nickel, cadmium, sulfur and
untreated human waste. Chowpatty Beach, on its best days, is rife
with garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptor Vijay R. Khatu, a man with a paunch to match even
Ganesh's, makes a point of these failings. He is Bombay's
best-known idol maker _ and, when asked, he said the opponents of
immersion can go jump in the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ganesh Festival comes once a year,'' he said. ``Every day,
the factories dump chemicals in the sea and the big ships leave
their diesel.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatu specializes in the bigger statues. They are not terribly
expensive, at least for the rich. A 22-foot idol costs about
$2,000, he said. Materials are cheap, mostly plaster, wood, mud,
coconut hair and spray paint.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the Ganeshes seem to grow taller. Political parties
and neighborhood associations want a god bigger than the next
guy's.
</P>
<P>
   Bombay's notorious mobsters also like to show off. The dons
commission huge statues, attempting to win the people's good will.
Small-time goons use the Ganesh Festival for extortion, extracting
``donations'' from shopkeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have taken an unacceptable turn,'' complained G.R.
Khairnar, one of the city's top administrators. ``The religious
part of the festival is getting lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Ganesh Festival _ as celebrated in Bombay and the
state of Maharashtra _ is rooted more in politics than religion. It
began in 1897 at the instigation of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, the leader
of the freedom movement against the British. Large political
gatherings had been banned, but religious festivals were exempted.
Ganesh was used by Tilak as a loophole.
</P>
<P>
   During the early festivals, religious skits were full of double
meanings as the freedom fighters tried to stir people into action.
Political uses of the celebration continue even now, with Ganesh
often portrayed as favoring one party's ideology over another.
</P>
<P>
   For those uses, as something of a running mate, the elephantine
god is a fine pick. He is extremely popular _ especially in India's
south and west _ very often a Hindu's first choice from the
pantheon of deities. While Ganesh is thought to be wise and strong,
there also seems something benign in the look of his macabre body,
even if he does ride around atop a rat.
</P>
<P>
   There are various myths about how Ganesh came to look
half-human, half-pachyderm. One has him guarding an entrance as his
mother, Parvati, bathed. As the god Shiva approached, the boy
blocked his way, and the stronger deity cut him in two at the neck.
To later pacify the grieving _ and decidedly angry _ Parvati, Shiva
replaced the missing head with another from the first animal he
found, an elephant.
</P>
<P>
   Another story _ this one especially popular with parents _ has
Ganesh's mother and father staging a race between him and his
brother. The distance: three laps around the world. Ganesh's
sibling, the better athlete, speedily began. But Ganesh, the wiser,
simply circled his parents, telling them irresistibly that they
were his world and he needed to go no farther.
</P>
<P>
   Pramilla Nyalpelly finds that tale aptly Ganeshian. ``He has
perfect wisdom,'' she said, standing before the idol that her
husband, Krishna, had brought home. Incense burned in the fading
afternoon light. The statue was happily adorned with flowers and
surrounded by offerings of bananas, sweets and coins. ``Ganesh
gives me everything without my asking. He knows what is in my heart
and in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Krishna Nyalpelly's extended family _ two dozen people _
convenes to celebrate the festival together. An art director in an
ad agency, he creates a different shrine each year. This time,
Ganesh is surrounded by paper lily pads and butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   There was a cheerful look to the idol's face, but the Nyalpellys
insisted that in a few days the same Ganesh will start to frown.
``He won't want to leave our home because he'll feel he has become
part of the family,'' said Mrs. Nyalpelly.
</P>
<P>
   But however much he might wish otherwise, Ganesh must depart,
she said. That is the teaching. ``Everything about life leads to
leaving. Every life comes with a death. Joy and sorrow are two
sides to the same coin.''
</P>
<P>
   In 10 days, the family will carry their Ganesh on a three-hour
walk to Chowpatty Beach. There they will place him in the water,
leaving him to disintegrate, one with the sea.

IN CHINA, CAPTIVE BEARS ARE RESCUED AS CONCERN FOR WILDLIFE GROWS 
</HEADLINE>
  By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ For years, the woman heard the moaning of animals.
Finally last month she could not stand it any more.
</P>
<P>
   She called a newspaper to report that a restaurant nearby was
keeping three black bears in tiny cages, milking their gall
bladders of bile to sell for its reputed medicinal value.
</P>
<P>
   After a sensational account in The Beijing Morning Post of Aug.
12, officers of the Beijing Forestry Bureau raided the restaurant,
to the south of Beijing. They hauled the bears to the Beijing
Wildlife Rescue Center and began a criminal investigation of the
restaurant owners, who did not have a permit to keep bears in
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   The bears are still recovering from their ordeal and may wind up
in a special reserve or a zoo, in an episode that reflects changing
attitudes about animal welfare among China's emerging middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, the Beijing municipality (which includes large
rural areas surrounding the dense city) did not have a wild animal
rehabilitation center, a result of budget problems as well as a
traditional lack of concern many Chinese have toward other species.
</P>
<P>
   The new center has been financed as a public service by a
private handicrafts company, but operates under the authority of
the Beijing Forestry Bureau. It takes in injured animals like hawks
as well as valuable birds or reptiles seized from wildlife
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which has only been operating since May, has been
almost overwhelmed by the demand for its services. ``Public
awareness about wildlife protection is rising, and more people are
reporting injured animals,'' said Chen Shu, the center's manager,
``but we never expected bears.''
</P>
<P>
   The travails of the three black bears also set off renewed
debate about the practice of bear farming for bile, which Chinese
authorities have promoted as the best way to combat poaching of
wild bears to supply the market.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bears recovered was found to have a tube dangling
from an open sore; its other end was inside the animal's gall
bladder. After being taken to the Beijing Wildlife Rescue Center, a
specially experienced foreign veterinarian was invited in to remove
the tube.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Asian medicine holds that bear bile can help treat a
variety of maladies, from eye disease to hepatitis to cancer. Less
formally, bile products are sold as general enhancers of health.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, large numbers of wild bears were killed for their
gall bladders and other products. But in recent decades, as the
government outlawed such killings, it encouraged bear farms as a
substitute. In the 1980s, thousands of bears were captured and
today 7,000 bears are kept on 247 licensed bear farms where they
are bred and tapped for bile.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials defend bear-bile farming as the safest way to
meet the demand. ``If one bear on a farm produces bile for 10
years, then the lives of 400 wild bears will be saved,'' said Fang
Zhiyong, a senior wildlife official, in a recent newspaper
interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 90s, the International Fund for Animal Welfare
publicized the abysmal conditions on some farms, where bears with
long festering sores were locked in tiny cages, and Chinese
officials have acknowledged that some farms are substandard.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, China signed an agreement with the Animals Asia
Foundation, a private group based in Hong Kong, under which many
smaller and poorly run farms in southern China will be closed. In
the next five years, 500 bears will be released to a natural
reserve to be run by the foundation in Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
   Officials pledged to reduce bear farming further over the next
15 years, with a long-term goal of ending the practice. But they
pointedly said it would not be outlawed so long as there is market
demand. They also insist that well-regulated, large farms can offer
more humane living conditions and methods of bile extraction.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife advocates take heart in signs of changing public
attitudes about animal welfare, and evidence that fewer medical
practitioners prescribe bile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand for bile has dropped and the price is going down,''
said Grace Ge Gabriel, head of the Beijing office of the
International Fund for Animal Welfare. The group is now working
with traditional medical practitioners around Asia to promote
herbal and synthetic alternatives to bile.

JAPAN ORDERS RESIDENTS OUT AFTER TREMORS ROCK ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ After two months of sporadic eruptions and frequent,
earth-shaking tremors in an island chain south of Tokyo, officials
Friday ordered the complete evacuation of Miyake Island, which has
been at the center of the seismic activity.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation, ordered almost simultaneously by the mayor of
Miyake, and by the governor of Tokyo prefecture, comes after almost
half of the island's 3,850 inhabitants had quietly left the island
to escape what has become near-constant volcanic activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision was made because the earthquakes and eruptions
have become so frequent that they represent a risk to human
lives,'' said Keita Takashima, a spokesman for the Tokyo
government.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation marks the second time in recent months that
volcanic activity has forced large-scale relocations in Japan.
Earlier this year, 13,000 people were evacuated from villages in
northern Japan near Mount Usu, after a major eruption of a volcano
that had been dormant there for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since it lies only 120 miles south of the capital, Tokyo, the
eruptions of Mount Oyama on Miyake have revived fears here of a
huge disaster in the case of a major earthquake. Several powerful
tremors have been felt in the capital itself, with one of them
reportedly caused by movements in the earth's crust deep below the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that the frequent tremors and eruptions on Miyake,
and throughout the surrounding Ise island chain, have made this
summer one of the most seismically active seasons on record.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say that the seismic activity in the Ise chain is
caused by shifts in huge underground pools of magma, but there is
disagreement among them over its relevance to Tokyo's tectonic
stability.
</P>
<P>
   These fears are reinforced by the still vivid memories of the
devastation of Kobe, a major port city southwest of Tokyo that was
struck by a violent earthquake in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was also the anniversary of the Great Tokyo Earthquake of
1923, which killed an estimated 150,000 people and left most of the
city burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result of the Kobe quake, the Tokyo government has
organized its largest annual emergency preparations drill on
Sunday, which is traditionally held at the beginning of September,
in commemoration of the huge quake that destroyed this city.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the prefectural government has called out
more than 7,000 members of the Self-Defense Forces, including
members of its air, sea and maritime branches, for highly visible
drills that include military-style rescue maneuvers involving
helicopters, light tanks, troop transport vehicles and landing
craft.
</P>
<P>
   The drills have fueled a major polemic here in a Japan, which
remains officially pacifist and without an army, about the role of
the Self-Defense Forces. Anti-militarists here say they suspect
that an unstated goal of the high-profile exercise is to raise the
profile of the armed forces gradually, improving the prospects for
conservative proposals to revise the constitution to allow Japan to
form an army for the first time since World War II.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The debate over the exercises has also involved complaints that
it is aimed at intimidating foreign Asians who reside in Japan
after menacing comments five months ago by Tokyo's governor,
Shintaro Ishihara.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many third-country nationals and foreigners who have entered
Japan illegally have perpetrated heinous crimes,'' Ishihara said in
April. ``In the event of a major earthquake, riots may break out,
and there is a limit to the police's ability to cope with such a
situation alone. I want you, the Self-Defense Forces, to carry out
your mission, not only to deal with natural disasters, but also to
maintain law and order.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, historians were quick to reply, thousands of Koreans
were lynched and their property stolen or destroyed by rioting
Japanese who had been whipped up by xenophobic local leaders during
in the Great Tokyo Earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Since those remarks, Ishihara has been forced to apologize to
Japan's foreign Asians, and ever since, has downplayed the law and
order element to the earthquake drill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were over 6,000 people killed by the Kobe earthquake,
and we were all ashamed by the poor response to the emergency,''
said Atsuyuki Sassa, a security expert who has advised Ishihara.
``The Self-Defense Force is a national asset, and we must use it in
emergency situations.''

PRESSURE IS ON MILLER, BUT OTHERS WILL ALSO BE TESTED 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not since Fox snared CBS's former NFL television heirloom in
1993 has a change in the sport's broadcast landscape provoked as
much curiosity as Dennis Miller's hiring on ABC's ``Monday Night
Football.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an odd, quirky choice,'' he told a group of writers last
week by telephone. ``It gives you something to write about.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he had learned several lessons during three
preseason games with Al Michaels and Dan Fouts: To speak less
frequently and to bring fewer scripted remarks into the booth. ``I
think I'll dial it back 15 to 20 percent, but I don't question
myself for overtalking during the first three games,'' Miller said.
``To define perimeters you have to go out and find the fence
line.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Miller has shown he belongs: His humor has hit its
mark more than it has missed, and he knows enough football to know
what he doesn't know; when he's underinformed, he asks Fouts to
define the more complex terminology.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the games will count, Miller's ability to integrate his
humor and insights will be tested. The producer, Don Ohlmeyer,
won't let Miller overwhelm any game, much less a tight one, and
Miller has no desire to be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Ohlmeyer, ``Some people would prefer we do downs and
yardage and nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We're not trying to irritate people but we won't
please everybody. I hope people will continue to watch, but if they
don't, there isn't much we can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The three low-rated preseason games aren't likely to serve as a
referendum on the ``MNF'' team. Two games started at 7 p.m., one at
8 p.m. The preseason schedule, Ohlmeyer said, was a ``real
disservice.''
</P>
<P>
   If Fouts has been affected by being ignored amid the Miller
Mania, he doesn't show it. The focus on Miller has given Fouts a
virtual free pass on widespread public judgment. But once Monday
night's game begins, he will be pressured to deliver more insights
than he ever has before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the game that matters,'' Fouts said. ``People tune in to
watch football. With Dennis' ability to give a different slant,
that's the mix we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's John Madden is a bit perplexed by the need for Miller at
ABC. ``If he's going to be an analyst, that's fine,'' he said.
``But I have a problem with needing to be entertained. If that's
true, if football isn't exciting enough where we need to be
entertained, then we've really overpaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Madden is the last person to argue against an analyst's being
entertaining. His whole success has been in making football
analysis fun.
</P>
<P>
   (Incidentally, in this third year of the networks' NFL deals,
ABC and ESPN are paying a combined $1.05 billion, CBS $500 million,
Fox $450 million. None of them say they are paying too much.)
</P>
<P>
   At CBS, the biggest change is to move its studio from indoors at
West 57th Street to outside the General Motors Building at 59th
Street and Fifth Avenue, where fans behind velvet ropes can scream
at Jerry Glanville and Mike Ditka.
</P>
<P>
   CBS was swayed to make the change by the interaction of network
morning show hosts and fans when they stray outside. ``I think it
will pay off in a show that's a lot more fun to watch and get
people to talk about the show,'' said Sean McManus, the president
of CBS Sports. ``My hope is that in a couple of years, we won't be
able to imagine not doing it outside with an audience.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not dignified, but it's loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vitality is more than you'd get inside,'' McManus said.
The addition of Ditka to the quartet of Glanville, Jim Nantz, Craig
James and Randy Cross is one of two high-profile personnel moves at
CBS. The other is the signing of Dick Enberg to team with Dan
Dierdorf.
</P>
<P>
   Two seasons without football at NBC were more than Enberg could
bear. ``I missed it more than I ever would have imagined,'' Enberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka's best year of three in a similar, albeit indoor, role at
NBC's studio show was his last, before his misguided return to
coaching with the New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year, I didn't want to say much,'' Ditka said.
</P>
<P>
   By the third year, his chemistry with Joe Gibbs made Ditka more
provocative and opinionated. Will he be risk averse in his rookie
year at CBS?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he said emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   FOX AND ESPN STAND PAT  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fox and ESPN have made virtually no changes in their lineups.
Fox Sports Net's 11 a.m.-to-noon cable program, ``NFL This
Morning,'' had hired the former Dallas Cowboy Michael Irvin, but
fired him after an arrest on marijuana possession charges that were
soon dropped. The arrogant Irvin was a risky and probably awful
hire who was unnecessary in light of the successful teaming last
year of Chris Myers, Marv Levy, Chris Spielman and Jackie Slater.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has made two very noticeable changes. First, umpires
will wear tiny cameras on their caps, providing a turf-level view
of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the umpire was feeling good,'' said CBS's Phil Simms,
``we got shots of players' feet. But as he got tired and started
standing up straight, we got better shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, the league will allow more than two Sunday games into
markets when home games are played. So, Fox or CBS can program one
of its doubleheader games into a market if the home game sells out
72 hours before kickoff and if the second broadcast does not
compete with the home game.

CHINA PROTESTS U.S. RIGHTS SUIT AGAINST A LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ China is demanding that U.S. officials dismiss a
federal civil lawsuit charging a high-ranking official with human
rights abuses stemming from the 1989 military crackdown that killed
hundreds of student protesters in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed Monday in federal district court in
Manhattan by five participants in the Tiananmen Square democracy
movement. The suit was brought against Li Peng, the country's prime
minister at the time and now the chairman of the National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials blamed the U.S. government for not properly
protecting Li from having a court summons served to him while he
was visiting New York.
</P>
<P>
   A process server handed the summons to a State Department
employee who was guarding Li. Although the State Department later
said it could not accept such papers for foreign officials, a
federal judge in Manhattan had ruled earlier that Li could be
served through his guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in New York concerning the serving of the court
papers is a political farce, put together by a small number of
anti-China elements,'' said Zhang Yuanyuan, a spokesman for the
Chinese Embassy in Washington, in a telephone interview on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The civil suit was filed by lawyers from the Center for
Constitutional Rights, a nonprofit legal group that specializes in
human rights cases. It is the first time that such a legal action
has been taken against a Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government was ``expressing strong opposition,
strong displeasure and dissatisfaction with the incident, and
launching a strong protest,'' Zhang said. He added that the charges
were ``absolutely absurd and unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials could not be reached Saturday for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses Li, who was prime minister during the
Tiananmen massacre, of being responsible for ``crimes against
humanity,'' including summary execution, arbitrary detention and
torture.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, who live in the United States, are four former
student dissidents and one man, Zhang Liming, whose sister was shot
dead by army troops that overran Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.
Among the former students is Wang Dan, who was released from
Chinese prison in 1998 and exiled to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The legal basis for the lawsuit comes from two U.S. statutes
that allow human rights victims anywhere in the world to file for
claims in this country's courts.
</P>
<P>
   Li has more than two weeks to answer the court order. He flew
back to China last Friday.

TWO TO PRESIDE OVER GENERAL ASSEMBLY 
</HEADLINE>
 (With U.N.-SUMMIT) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Unable to decide whether this year's or last
year's General Assembly president should be in the chair for a
summit meeting of all member nations this week, U.N. members took
the diplomatic way out. Both will preside.
</P>
<P>
   Namibia held the presidency of the 54th General Assembly, which
ends with the special summit meeting session. Finland will be
president of the 55th General Assembly. For the past year, Namibia
has been represented in the assembly president's chair by Theo-Ben
Gurirab, the country's foreign minister. But for the special summit
meeting, President Sam Nujoma will be here.
</P>
<P>
   He will share duties with President Tarja Halonen of Finland.
Halonen, who was elected president of Finland in February, is a
trade union lawyer and has been a member of Parliament since 1979.
From 1995 until this year, she served as Finland's foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Nujoma, the founder of the South West Africa People's
Organization, led his country to independence from South Africa
with the help of the United Nations in 1989, and became Namibia's
first president in 1990.

WORKERS STAY ON JOBS AT FIRESTONE AFTER STRIKE DEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying there had been progress in negotiations, the union
representing nearly 8,000 Bridgestone/Firestone workers told its
workers to remain on the job Saturday even though the union and
company had not reached a settlement before the strike deadline of
12:01 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the union, the United Steelworkers of America,
warned nonetheless that the talks, being held in St. Louis, could
still break down and that they could still call the workers out on
strike. But Bridgestone/Firestone officials sounded upbeat about
reaching a tentative contract and averting a walkout threatened at
9 of the company's 11 U.S. factories.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia McCafferty, a Bridgestone/Firestone spokeswoman, said in
an interview Saturday morning, ``The negotiators worked past the
deadline last night, and we are encouraged by the progress that's
been made. There are still some remaining issues and we are
continuing to work to resolve these. We are definitely
encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday, Wayne Ranick, a spokesman for the
Pittsburgh-based union, said that the two sides had resolved
several important issues, but that other major subjects of
bargaining had still not been worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides refused to say which issues had been settled and
which remained on the table. Over the past week the two sides have
been focusing on pensions, wages, seniority rights, grievance and
arbitration procedures, and the company's policy on absences. Under
the old contract, pay ranges from $9 an hour for new employees to
$19 an hour for experienced workers.
</P>
<P>
   George Becker, president of United Steelworkers of America,
said, ``We have made enough progress over the past two days that
the union is willing to continue working while bargaining goes
on.''
</P>
<P>
   A strike would involve workers at factories in Akron, Ohio;
Bloomington, Ill.; Decatur, Ill.; Des Moines, Iowa; Noblesville,
Ind.; Oklahoma City; Russellville, Ark.; LaVergne, Tenn.; and
Warren County, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   McCafferty, the company spokeswoman, said, ``We definitely
appreciate the decision by the union to stay on the job. The plants
are open and production continued uninterrupted.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A strike would be another serious blow to a company that is
reeling from a crisis in which it faces congressional
investigations and dozens of lawsuits after federal regulators
linked its tires to accidents causing at least 88 deaths and more
than 250 injuries. On Aug. 9, the company recalled 6.5 million
15-inch tires used on sport utility vehicles after federal
officials disclosed widespread complaints that the tread can
separate from the rest of the tire and cause failures that can
result in rollovers.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone's situation was complicated on Friday when the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration took the unusual
step of warning consumers that 1.4 million additional Firestone
tires that the company refused to recall could pose a safety risk
and should be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say a strike would make it harder for
Bridgestone/Firestone, which is Japanese-owned, to meet the huge
backlog of replacing all the recalled tires. The company has said
that even without a strike it would not be able to replace the more
than 6 million tires until this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Bridgestone/Firestone, which is based in
Nashville, said a strike would hardly delay its efforts to work
down the backlog. It is airlifting replacement tires from its
factories in Japan, and its nonunion factory in Wilson, N.C., is
making replacement tires for sport utility vehicles. That factory
is not threatened by a strike because it is not covered by a union
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Several labor analysts said the union was acting shrewdly by
threatening a strike when Bridgestone/Firestone was vulnerable and
badly needed to keep its factories open to work down the backlog.
But steelworker officials insisted that they were not trying to hit
the company when it was down.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said, the tire workers were growing angry and
impatient about the lack of progress in talks after months of
negotiations. Most of the 8,000 workers are covered by a master
contract that expired on April 23. Since that time, they have been
working under a temporary contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   In the industry, Bridgestone is known for having worse labor
relations than its competitors. Many union members still voice
bitterness toward Bridgestone over its widespread use of
replacement workers during a 10-month strike that started in July
1994. During that walkout, Bridgestone enraged the union by saying
it would permanently replace 2,300 of the 4,200 strikers.
</P>
<P>
   The union ended the strike in May 1995, but because of the
company's extensive use of replacement workers, all the unionized
workers were still not taken back to work by 1996, when a new
contract was reached.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Ford Motor Co. said that most of the defective
tires were manufactured in the Decatur plant when it was relying on
replacement workers.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ This was a day of high legal drama, as a
last-minute government maneuver thwarted defense efforts to free
the former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee on bail and left the
federal district judge hearing the case, James A. Parker, suddenly
on the sidelines as the action leapt to an appeals court in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But if there was a lesson about Parker in the episode, it was
conveyed in his unemotional willingness to simply follow the letter
of the law, even as the defense lawyers accused the prosecutor of
effectively turning a hearing here into a diversion while he
surreptitiously filed the appeal. Parker simply noted that the
appeals court's one-sentence order had taken the issue out of his
hands, and left it at that.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, 63, a lanky, understated, Jimmy Stewart-like figure, is
no judicial activist. In a lengthy interview Friday morning in his
chambers, an ``I Love Fishing'' sign and framed family pictures on
the shelf behind him, he described himself as a conservative
Republican; indeed, he was appointed to the bench in 1987 by
President Reagan. He made it clear that he was quite comfortable
making even unpopular decisions if he felt they were supported by a
strict reading of the law.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why, he added, he has not hesitated in issuing a
string of bold decisions in Lee's national security case. Among
them were the decisions granting bail to the scientist and ordering
the government to hand over thousands of pages of classified
documents to see if they supported the defense's assertions that
Lee was unfairly singled out for prosecution for mishandling
nuclear weapons secrets because of his Chinese ancestry. Both
struck harsh blows to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they were difficult decisions because they were
perceived to be against the interests of the government,'' said
Parker, in a rich, throaty baritone that carries a twangy residue
of his upbringing in Texas. ``They were difficult because they were
close, but the law seemed clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Expanding only slightly on his philosophy, he said later in the
conversation, ``My role is to follow the rules as established by
the higher level courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday was actually Parker's first day as chief judge of the
federal district of New Mexico. But if the courtroom blasts seemed
to mark an inauspicious start, Parker showed none of it. The two
sides had had their day in court, and that seemed to satisfy the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Cordero, an assistant U.S. attorney in Washington and one
of his first law clerks here, said that two of Parker's more
remarkable qualities were his insights into human behavior and his
prairie-lawyer spirit in believing wholeheartedly in the importance
of giving people their day in court, even if that means allowing
lawyers to go on and on, as he has frequently in Lee's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an unusually fair man,'' Cordero said. ``He truly
believes in giving everyone their day in court and letting them
have their say. I know there were lots of times I would have cut
off people long before he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker gave a lengthy interview to a reporter here Friday
morning, and then continued the conversation about topics like fly
fishing _ particularly the relative merits of the five different
kinds of trout to be found in a wild stretch of the Pine River _
and his belief in the need for more mediation in criminal trials as
he offered a tour of the palatial, sun-drenched offices that he
will soon be occupying.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was a series of random accidents that landed the
case of Lee in his court, Parker expressed fascination with the
issues involved, particularly the way scientists operate. He even
paused for a moment to reflect on what he perceived to be the core
values of the scientific mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pursuit of knowledge is paramount,'' he said. ``Their
lives are not like yours or mine. They're seeking pure scientific
knowledge. I recognize that they need free expression with
scientists anywhere in the world to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker grew up in Houston and received his undergraduate degree
in mechanical engineering from Rice University, then went to the
University of Texas law school. Although he does not seem to be a
man given to spontaneous decisions, that was essentially what
brought him to New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He said that after law school he was interested in moving to
Phoenix and had arranged some job interviews there. The airline had
no direct flights, so he had to stop in Albuquerque. At the urging
of a law professor, he used the time to literally walk in cold at
some law firms. Things worked out.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually spent several decades working for the largest law
firm in New Mexico, Modrall, Sperling, Roehl, Harris &AMP; Sisk, and
specialized in civil litigation, particularly medical and legal
malpractice cases.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming a judge, he has handled a number of complex
cases, but none in the area of national security or nuclear
secrets. Among the more high-profile cases he has handled was one
in which he effectively ordered the state to improve or shut down
its systems for caring for the mentally disabled. Following his
ruling, the state shut them and created community care centers
instead. Other cases have involved the immensely complex laws
surrounding the usage of water from the state's rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The personal stamp he has brought to Lee's case has been his
willingness to give all sides a chance to have their say. Twice he
allowed what had been expected to be brief bail hearings to drag on
for three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the information being brought out in open court is
for the use of the press rather than my use, but I recognize the
national interest,'' he said.

COLLINS READY TO BECOME THE LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday morning in northern New Jersey, Kerry Collins won't be
driving his car to the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly a big enough day for a meditative ride from his
Hackensack apartment to Giants Stadium, where Collins will make his
first start as the unilateral and figurative leader of the Giants,
a mantle only a quarterback can claim.
</P>
<P>
   Collins will instead be driven to the stadium for the opening
game with Arizona by receiver Joe Jurevicius. With his driver's
license suspended until Feb. 1, Collins won't be driving to any
games this year.
</P>
<P>
   It's an inconvenience, the millionaire athlete who needs a lift
to grocery shop.
</P>
<P>
   More telling: A penalty for drunken driving is the last remnant
of Collins' famously troubled football season two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of 1998 was a fireball of strife for Collins, a
stunning decline from athletic idol to object of scorn, all
crystallized in one early-morning meeting in the office of Carolina
Panthers coach Dom Capers. Capers came out of that meeting and
announced that Collins had quit. Capers no longer discusses the
meeting, and Collins has never given his side.
</P>
<P>
   But late one afternoon last week, Collins said of that day: ``As
it turned out, it was the best thing that ever happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Having coaches, teammates, fans and the news media vilify you
for months is hardly the typical criterion for a life-enhancing
moment, but the contemplative Collins, now 27, puts it in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the most glorious day,'' he said. ``But I probably
thought it was best.'' Collins said he knew there would be
difficult things to put up with, ``but at the same time, I saw no
happy way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some of it was my fault and I hadn't dealt with a lot
of things well,'' he said. ``I wasn't the happiest person because I
didn't have the support I needed. I hadn't, for example, talked to
my parents in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tried to help me and tell me what to do with my life,
but I didn't want to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins seeks no absolution and avoids the subject of his 1998
problems. He knows how some still view him; he hears it from the
stands when the team is on the road. But if there is a window to
Collins' future _ and reason to believe he can fix the Giants'
quarterback situation _ it is how far removed Collins feels from
his past.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the Giants 18 months ago wanting people to know, to
use his own words, that he wasn't a drunk, a quitter or a racist.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week what he wants fans to know about him now,
Collins did not hesitate with his answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to know that I can play,'' he said. ``That I'm
playing as well as I ever have in my career. So much has been said
about the off-the-field stuff, the question of whether I can play
has gotten lost.''
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room, Collins has won over a skeptical audience.
The defense's leaders, linebacker Jessie Armstead and end Michael
Strahan, welcomed Collins last year, but there was an underlying
wait-and-see attitude. The defense is driven by results, and from
Dave Brown to Tommy Maddox to Danny Kanell to Kent Graham,
disillusionment followed every quarterback make-over.
</P>
<P>
   Then Collins took over for Graham late last year and threw for
341 yards in a romp against the New York Jets. In the off-season,
his teammates saw Collins tramp through the snow to the team's
indoor facility daily to throw dozens of passes to the receivers.
They noticed that he hung around late, sometimes going up to the
team's offices, where Collins made himself at home with the
organization and the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who said he no longer drinks, led a quiet life away
from the locker room. ``No bars, no clubs, and I'm thankful that I
don't need to go to them,'' he said. He went to night school,
seeking a master's degree in addiction counseling.
</P>
<P>
   By this summer's training camp, Collins had taken command,
speaking out in team meetings and yelling orders in practice when
teammates made mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Armstead, who says he does not like any offensive players when
he is on the field, was moved by what he observed. He said of
Collins: ``I'm going to fight for the guy. We haven't had a guy
around here say, `This is my show.' But that's Kerry. He told those
guys that he's the navigator of the ship, sink or swim.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan threw in his support on similar grounds. ``We've been
waiting for somebody on the other side of the ball to stand up and
say, `OK, this is my team, too,''' Strahan said. ``Kerry has done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, while he has had a good preseason, completing 61
percent of his passes, Collins has thrown far more interceptions
(47) than touchdowns (31) in the three seasons since his best year,
1996. In the NFL, while most have accepted that he has matured
personally, an equal number wonder if he will ever show the pocket
poise of a dominant quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I've played the last few years, that kind of thinking
isn't unjustified,'' Collins said. ``It doesn't mean it can't be
changed. I have such a different commitment to the position now. I
used to play well and not even be able to tell you why.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes the 1996 season, when Collins went to the Pro
Bowl.``Back then,'' Collins said, ``I had never made my job the 100
percent priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have always tried to replicate the family-style
atmosphere Collins enjoyed as an All-American at Penn State. ``That
was something we thought we could do,'' General Manager Ernie
Accorsi said. ``And those were his happiest days.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1995 draft, Collins was quoted extensively as saying
he wanted to be selected by one of the older franchises, mentioning
Chicago, Washington, Philadelphia and the Giants. But he went to
expansion Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always sought structure, tradition and accountability,''
he said last week. ``It's one of the reasons I went to Penn State.
The Giants have been perfect for me. I'm humbled by the sense that
I'm the quarterback of the New York Giants.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he would feel the weight of the assignment as he
comes upon Giants Stadium Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a big moment,'' he said, acknowledging the
turbulent circumstances that have led to the occasion, including
the one that remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't drive,'' the Giants' new quarterback said, smiling.
``Lesson learned.''

   GRIMES, Iowa _ With green acres of cornstalks rolling as far as
the eye can see, these few weeks just before the fall harvest are
probably the loveliest time of the year here.
</P>
<P>
   But this season is also, perhaps, the most hazardous, thanks in
large part to that same corn, which has grown to record heights
this summer with the help of some well-timed spring rains.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is traffic accidents. This town, like hundreds in
Iowa, is crisscrossed by dozens of unpaved, gravel-road
intersections, many of them without stop signs. The corn can
obscure drivers' views of coming traffic, which often leads to
wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen people come speeding through here at all hours of
the night,'' said Jason Hemann, a farmer who lives near such an
intersection, and who says more stop signs would help. ``I know
which intersections to stop at, but a lot of people come through
gawking and don't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as there have been corn and cars, there have been
problems in Iowa in August, said Tom Welch, of the Iowa Department
of Transportation. But Welch, who estimates there are 60 to 70
corn-related accidents in Iowa each summer, says this year's giant
corn crop is not the only cause.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in places like Grimes, which is in one of the
fastest-growing counties in Iowa, is compounded by the migration of
city people from nearby Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   These days, half-million-dollar homes and new schools are
springing up on former corn fields. Housing developments butt up
against farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farm people know to slow down,'' said Doug James, who farms
with Hemann. ``The city folk from Des Moines drive out here and
like to stop and look, `Ooh, look at the corn, look at the farm.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Barkley joins most farmers in saying that more stop signs
would solve the problem. In July, when Barkley's 18-year-old son,
Nick, was killed in an accident outside Sioux City, another place
where urban sprawl has complicated matters, state police told her
that corn might have been a factor. ``A stop sign costs $250,''
said Barkley. ``But they won't put one up until someone dies.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who are not farmers in Grimes, most of them
professionals who work in the city, acknowledge that they use the
gravel roads to avoid the busy highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone through here fast early in the morning or in the
afternoon, when I'm going to pick up my daughter from day care,''
said Scott Kruse, who moved to Grimes about four years ago. ``A lot
of people use these roads to avoid traffic. You can wait up to 15
minutes at the stop sign over there,'' Kruse said, pointing to the
paved highway.
</P>
<P>
   But Kruse, who was once a farmer, said the corn, not just the
drivers, was to blame for the accidents, and he said the crops
should be cut back. He noted that the tops of the stalks could be
removed without damaging the corn, but added that many farmers did
not bother because they were busy.
</P>
<P>
   Welch said a balance must be struck. Stop signs, he said, are
not necessarily the answer in towns where unrestricted
intersections have been around for dozens of years, and where
unwritten rules dictate who is supposed to yield to whom on which
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``More stop signs just create a disrespect for those signs,''
Welch said. The best solution, he suggested, was cutting back corn
where possible.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers resent that suggestion. Jay Farrow, a retired
farmer, said farmers should be able to grow as much corn as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bushel of corn hardly buys you a bottle of pop anymore,'' he
said.

<P>
   The New York Jets' regular season begins Sunday against Green
Bay at Lambeau Field, but the restiveness that accompanied an
off-season of extraordinary tumult may linger for a while. An
almost eerily quiet training camp _ a quiet assured in some part by
the trade of receiver Keyshawn Johnson _ gives way to a season in
which the Jets will be required to solve their mysteries as a team,
just as surely as they must solve opposing defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Is Vinny Testaverde healthy enough _ and young enough _ to
return to something approaching his 1998 form? Will Mike Nolan's
defense look much different from Bill Belichick's or, as several
players have noted, is Nolan spending more time getting used to
them than they are to him? Whither the passing game, now that
Johnson, the big, have-no-fear receiver, is gone and the starting
two receivers are about the height of the average accountant? What
sort of imprint will coach Al Groh try to put on the team before
the inevitable looming shadow of Bill Parcells threatens to engulf
him?
</P>
<P>
   Groh talked to some of his key veterans as early as spring
minicamp to impress upon them the importance of a fast start this
season. A quick look in the mirror may be in order as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're trying to find our personality,'' center Kevin
Mawae said. ``That may take half a season to find. For us, our goal
is to find it really early.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are still trying to figure out Groh, the cerebral,
serious, detail-oriented successor to the larger-than-life
Parcells. Groh is less prone to bombast, but he also lacks
Parcells' gift for delivering a well-timed zinger with a message
attached. When asked how the adjustment was going, Mawae said:
``How do you adjust to a new car? It's the same thing. You break it
in. You see what you like and what you don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are hoping to accomplish a Wallenda-like balancing act:
reinvent themselves under a new owner and new coaching staff with a
revived quarterback and a new top receiver, while maintaining all
the good things Parcells did to transform the Jets into Super Bowl
contenders before Testaverde's devastating Achilles' injury last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of questions to be answered,'' Testaverde said.
``We've got a head coach who steps down and goes to the front
office, another head coach goes to New England. We've got Al taking
over, we lose the entire defensive staff except for Al, we lose our
offensive coordinator and our tight ends coach. We lose Keyshawn.
We have Jason Fabini coming back from knee surgery. We have me
coming back from a major injury, one that people call career
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of uncertainty until we actually get into the
season and prove that this is still a very good football team with
some new faces both on the coaching staff and down in the locker
room.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, while they look for answers, are fortunate to play in
a division experiencing incredible flux. Of the five teams in the
AFC East, three _ the Jets, the Patriots and the Dolphins _ have
new head coaches. Buffalo and Miami have quarterback controversies
and the trade of Johnson was no more stunning to Jets fans than
when Buffalo jettisoned three players who made them contenders for
years. Only Indianapolis, with its trio of offensive stars, seems
stable in its position at the top of the division, which it won
last season with a 13-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   Few of those teams have as many issues unfolding simultaneously.
Nolan has made only minor adjustments from the defense Belichick
crafted, but the Jets hope their pass rush is bolstered by the
rookies Shaun Ellis and John Abraham, who will not start Sunday but
are expected to play plenty. Testaverde, who is nearing 37, is
healthy and, his teammates attest, back to pre-injury form, perhaps
even better for the one-year rest. But Testaverde played sparingly
in the preseason, and even he admits that he does not know how he
will react when he drops back in the pocket for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, one wonders what he will see when he looks
downfield. The 5-foot-10-inch Wayne Chrebet possesses a marvelous
ability to get free from defenses, but he will face increased
attention in Johnson's absence. Dedric Ward is no taller than
Chrebet. Vincent Brisby was signed recently to provide the
big-body, over-the-middle capability that was lost when Johnson was
sent packing.
</P>
<P>
   If the offense stalls, it will not take long for observers to
wistfully recall Johnson's exploits. The Jets have not started the
season at better than 1-2 since 1994, but Groh needs a fast start
so that the Bill Buzz doesn't grow into a roar.
</P>
<P>
   Groh has, according to Testaverde, made subtle changes to
practices and scheduling, but there has been no dramatic gesture to
put his own stamp on the team. His relationship with Parcells is
simple and fluid, Groh says: Sometimes they talk a few times a day,
sometimes not at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said before I was the coach, it was never my intention to
provide continuity,'' Groh said. ``It was a circumstance. I don't
ever work with or around a football legend. He's a great resource
to me. That he's a legend to somebody else, that's somebody else's
perception.''
</P>
<P>
   But several players, most notably Testaverde and linebacker
Bryan Cox, say that having Parcells in the building has smoothed
the segue to the new season. When the season is over, it will
inevitably be viewed through a prism colored by Parcells'
personality and success, one that could easily distort the answers
the Jets uncover this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still Bill's team,'' Cox said. ``Al is the coach. Al
has all the decisions. But a lot of people here haven't changed.
It's the same players and the same system Bill had. The bottom line
is Bill is still the director of football operations. He lets Al do
all the things he wants to do, but Al can lean on him for advice.
Al's running everything and Bill is tucked away in case Al wants
him.''

 &HT;    A healthy, happy Chandler hopes for a winning season
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Chris Chandler takes the first snap of the season
today in the Georgia Dome, he probably won't be grinning.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons' quarterback has been smiling more, and it might
predict a good season.
</P>
<P>
   As Chandler, 34, enters the 13th year of his NFL career, his
best seasons have come when he has been happiest.
</P>
<P>
   His two highest passer ratings came in 1997 and 1998 with the
Falcons, when his marks of 95.1 and 97.2 seemed connected to his
confidence in gaining unconditional control of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler probably won't ever be a candidate for a congeniality
award. But dating back to last spring's offseason program, when he
was a more regular visitor than in the previous three seasons, he
has been downright bubbly by his usual standards.
</P>
<P>
   The team has improved the offense, and he said that his wife,
Diane, and daughters Ryan Mae, Skye, and Brynn are great, thank you
very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look around, and we have more talent, and it gives all of
us cause to feel better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughters, I got one in kindergarten, one's full-time in
preschool _ I'm just real happy at home although I don't know if
that makes a difference here.'' Not having to worry about other
quarterbacks helped him to the Pro Bowl in 1997 and 1998. Those two
years, he threw 23 red-zone touchdowns and no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he got a contract extension days before the
season-opening game, and his average of 9.65 yards gained for every
pass attempted was the highest in the NFL in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last season was miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's numbers weren't bad; he completed 56.7 percent of his
passes for 16 touchdowns, 11 interceptions and a passer rating of
83.5.
</P>
<P>
   But in the season-opening 17-14 loss to Minnesota, he pulled his
right hamstring. It bothered him for more than a month, and was
part of the reason he missed four entire games, and parts of four
others.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in training camp last year, Chandler made no secret of
the fact that he missed swift wide receiver Tony Martin, who had
been released in the middle of legal difficulties then.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's per-attempt average fell to 7.6 yards, middle of the
pack in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The low point in a 5-11 season came after a 41-13 loss at home
Oct. 17 to the Rams. Reeves lifted him in the third quarter because
Chandler had flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The next week, Reeves pulled Chandler aside. The coach told his
quarterback, who already had missed three of the team's first six
games and left the other three early, to set an example, to find a
way to stay in games.
</P>
<P>
   In four of the final 10 games, Chandler had passer ratings of
106.3 or higher. He missed one game with a serious rib injury.
</P>
<P>
   New quarterbacks coach Jerry Rhome, who worked with Chandler at
Arizona in the early 1990s and in Houston in the mid-'90s, sees a
differences from the quarterback he had then, the quarterback he
heard about last year and the quarterback he's got now.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the 6-foot-4, 226-pounder from the University of
Washington is in his best shape since coming to the Falcons in a
1997 trade with Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing, he's `the' quarterback, and he's not having to
look back over his shoulder, where in Houston he did (with young
Steve McNair), and in Phoenix he was in a fierce battle with
(Steve) Beuerlein for playing time,'' Rhome said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's given him confidence. And I think he came into
camp in better physical condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength and flexibility gained through extra workouts might
help in several ways a player who has missed games in every NFL
season became of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' he said. ``I go into every season saying I want
to take every snap.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Chandler said, is the talent upgrade at several
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that everybody's level of confidence is
tied, to some extent, to the people around them,'' he said. ``I
have confidence that (running back) Jamal (Anderson) is back and
running stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence that (wide receiver) Tim (Dwight) has
improved, that we have (wide receiver) Shawn (Jefferson), that
(wide receiver) Brian Finneran has improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's also sees a return of the locker-room chemistry that
was so important on the way to the Super Bowl two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good,'' he said. ``When there's a lot of bantering going
back and forth, I always think that's a good sign, and we have a
lot more of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on Sundays, you have to play well. There's never any
guarantees, . . . but I think we have a better chance this year.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ The candidate praises President Clinton's
``extraordinary record,'' crediting the president for the muscular
economy. He tells audiences that Clinton has fought crime. He
reminds people that he has been the president's friend for 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the words of Vice President Al Gore, who rarely
mentions Clinton on the campaign trail. Gore has spent much of this
campaign year trying to put distance between himself and a
president whose record, foibles and outsize personality have made
him a mixed blessing to his partner and political heir.
</P>
<P>
   No, the speaker is Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Gore's running mate,
who was the first Democrat in the Senate to chastise Clinton for
his sexual misbehavior and is sufficiently distant from Buddhist
temples, Oval Office dalliances and Arkansas land deals that he
does not feel the need to hold the president at arm's length.
Clinton has hardly been a centerpiece of the senator's pitch, but
in the weeks since his nomination, it has been clear that Lieberman
feels far freer than Gore to embrace the president and claim
bragging rights to the achievements of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last eight years, Bill Clinton and Al Gore have led a
fight to get tough on violent crime,'' Lieberman said on Monday at
a union rally in Chicago. Earlier in the day, he had told a
gathering of religious leaders, ``I'm very proud of this
extraordinary record the Clinton-Gore administration has built
up.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday in Anaheim, Calif., he told the Communications
Workers of America that a strong economy and investments in
technology were ``the kind of change Bill Clinton and Al Gore
brought to America,'' citing their ``brilliant leadership.'' And on
Thursday in Portland, Ore., he said, ``There's a lot for the
president to be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman often mentions Clinton by name, and even when he does
not, the connection is obvious. In one of the segments of his
standard stump speech that draws some of his loudest applause and
cheers, he rebuts the Republicans who have called Clinton's two
terms a time of squandered opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're one of the 22 million people who's in a job that was
created in the last eight years, you sure know that the last eight
years have not been squandered,'' he said Friday in Portland,
Maine. ``If you're one of the 4 million new businesses in America _
two million small businesses _ that have been created in the last
eight years, you know they haven't been squandered. If you are one
of the millions who've gone from the dependency of welfare to the
self-sufficiency of work, you know these last eight years have not
been squandered. And if you're one of the other millions who have
either bought a new home or refinanced the ones you have because we
did turn deficits into surpluses and kept the interest rates down,
you know these last eight years have not been squandered.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, played down
what he conceded were differences in the two running mates'
treatment of the president, but even in doing so, he referred to
Clinton only indirectly. ``I do think the vice president
acknowledges the great success of the last eight years,'' he said.
``Maybe not at every event. But what the vice president has been
talking about mostly is about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do about Clinton has posed a dilemma throughout the
campaign for Gore. The vice president has been an unusually
influential second-in-command to a popular president during a time
of enormous prosperity, but he has had difficulty being seen, as he
proclaimed himself at the Democrats' convention in Los Angeles, as
``my own man.'' And his reputation for rectitude has been shaken by
the investigation of fund-raising for the 1996 campaign and by
association with Clinton's private behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has frequently used current or former Clinton
administration officials as surrogates in making his case to the
reporters. And in Lieberman, Gore has a vehicle for boasting about
his role in the administration, without doing so himself.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democratic faithful, at least, the praise of the
president has been well received. Interviews with people at
Lieberman's rallies found that most agreed with Virginia Minarik,
who said in Chicago, ``I'm glad he's not running away from Clinton
like Gore is, because Clinton's been a great president.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lieberman was effusive in his praise of
Clinton. ``I feel really comfortable doing it, because President
Clinton deserves it,'' he said. ``We have become the party of
fiscal responsibility and economic growth,'' an achievement he
attributed to ``the president and the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   He was careful to distinguish Clinton's personal behavior, which
he deplored so publicly in 1998, from his performance as president.
</P>
<P>
   What few voters realize is that in 1992, before Clinton chose
Gore as his running mate, he was closer to Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, while a student at Yale law school, Clinton worked on
Lieberman's first political campaign, for the state Senate, and
they have kept in close touch since. They worked closely together
in the 1980s on the Democratic Leadership Council, committed to
pushing the Democratic Party toward the center, and Lieberman
succeeded Clinton as head of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the first senator outside of Arkansas to endorse him''
in 1992, Lieberman recalled. He spoke of the ``extraordinary joy''
he felt that year in watching Clinton succeed in conveying his
ideas. ``And then, to have the tremendous satisfaction of seeing
them work. You know, the extraordinary good times, welfare reform,
crime is down. So, you know, that's a remarkable record.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the campaign stump, Vice President Al Gore
pushes his plan for a Medicare prescription-drug benefit as a
humane effort to help older Americans who are being gouged by
profit-hungry pharmaceutical manufacturers. In television
commercials, Gov. George W. Bush's campaign characterizes the Gore
plan as another example of bureaucracy run amok.
</P>
<P>
   But presidential politics, where sound bites often trump
substance, is far simpler than drug pricing, and beneath the
candidates' harsh oratory lurk complex questions about the
economics of drug advertising, the dynamics of price controls, and
the budgets of research laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The answers will affect not only the elderly and taxpayers in
general, but also the shape of the prescription-drug business, one
of the nation's most lucrative industries.
</P>
<P>
   With more sophisticated and expensive medicines being introduced
every year, a big question is whether Medicare will be able to
afford them. The drug industry's trade group says the plan will
inevitably run out of money, resulting in price controls, which
could prompt cutbacks in research. But the drug companies typically
spend more on advertising than they do on research, leading the
vice president to suggest they can well afford a dip in prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, this is not the kind of issue that bumper
stickers are made of,'' said Gail R. Wilensky, who ran the Health
Care Financing Administration, the agency that administers the
Medicare program, under Bush's father when he was president. ``The
good news is we don't pass legislation in campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical pricing legislation is fraught with unintended
consequences. The last time Congress passed a bill that it thought
would lower drug prices was in 1990, when it required drug
manufacturers to offer their lowest prices to the federal Medicaid
program. The result, according to a 1996 study by the Congressional
Budget Office, was that the manufacturers simply raised prices for
health maintenance organizations. So the government paid less, but
private insurers paid more.
</P>
<P>
   With profits that rank consistently higher than those of other
Fortune 500 companies, and products that can cost tens of thousands
of dollars a year, the drug industry has long been an easy target
for politicians. Forty years ago, Estes Kefauver, the Democratic
senator from Gore's home state of Tennessee, held hearings into the
pricing practices of drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no issue touches as many lives as the price of
medication, which is one reason the issue is dominating the
political debate. Another has to do with economics: While
prescription drugs account for only 9 percent of all health-care
spending, they are now the fastest-growing segment of the national
health bill.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Americans
spent $91 billion on prescription medications; the total is
expected to reach $243 billion in 2008. The elderly bear a
disproportionate burden: They account for 13 percent of the
population but over a third of all drug spending, and nearly
one-third of them lack insurance coverage for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan to ease that burden is nearly identical with
President Clinton's. Except for the poorest of the poor, the
elderly would not have insurance covering the full cost of all
their prescription drugs. Older Americans whose incomes are 135
percent of the poverty level or lower, about $12,000 a year for an
individual and $14,000 for couples, would have all of their drug
costs covered.
</P>
<P>
   Others would pay premiums on a sliding scale, and would be
reimbursed for half the cost of their prescriptions up to $5,000 a
year. Once the $5,000 cap has been met, beneficiaries would pay out
of pocket, up to an additional $1,500. After that, a catastrophic
insurance provision would kick in, and the government would pay all
additional drug bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign estimates the cost of the proposal at $253
billion over 10 years; an analysis by the Congressional Budget
Office estimates that the president's plan would cost $297 billion
during that time. But the actual cost, Wilensky said, is extremely
difficult to predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ability to accurately project prescription-drug costs,
particularly if you say you are not going to have administered
pricing _ that's the polite word for price controls _ is poor,''
Wilensky said.
</P>
<P>
   A central feature of the Gore plan is that it offers a uniform
benefit; in each region, all Medicare beneficiaries would be
covered by the same plan, administered by a single
pharmacy-benefits manager under contract with Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of government control worries the pharmaceutical
industry, a worry that some health-care economists say is
justified.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan would effectively give Medicare vast purchasing
power, enabling the government to extract deep discounts from drug
makers. Medicare drug prices would then become public _ in the
private sector, negotiated discounts are kept secret _ and private
insurers would inevitably demand similar breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare is the big gorilla,'' Uwe Reinhardt, the Princeton
University health-care economist, said in an interview last month.
But with more people covered by insurance, he argued, the volume of
prescriptions would rise, which would offset any decrease in
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Republicans, Bush favors letting the private sector
handle prescription-drug coverage, an approach that has drawn
criticism because many private insurers say they will not offer
drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has characterized the Gore proposal as a
``one-size-fits-all plan'' that would interfere with the authority
of doctors, presumably because it would restrict patients' access
to medication by limiting the list of drugs covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban
Institute, a research organization in Washington, such restrictive
lists, called formularies, are far more likely to emerge under the
Republican approach. That is because the private sector would offer
varied plans, giving consumers the opportunity to save money by
choosing plans that restricted access.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan like Gore's, Reischauer said, formularies would be
``politically unsustainable.'' He added, ``The notion that the
government will choose your drugs is far from the reality that will
evolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush will offer a specific prescription-drug proposal this week,
his campaign says. His aides said he would incorporate a
prescription-drug benefit into an overhaul of the Medicare program,
building on work of a bipartisan congressional commission that
called for competition between the public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's proposal, which, like the Gore plan, would have
the government absorb prescription-drug costs for the very poor,
has been introduced as legislation by Sens. John Breaux, D-La., and
Bill Frist, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   These two approaches _ a uniform Medicare benefits package
versus a range of private-sector plans _ reflect deep ideological
differences between Democrats and Republicans about the proper role
of government. Caught in the middle are the drug makers, who are
siding with Bush. Since last year, according to an analysis by the
Campaign Study Group, drug makers have contributed $235,515 to Bush
compared with $50,700 for Gore.

</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, the vice president has relentlessly
attacked the companies as price gougers. But the forces that are
driving prescription-drug spending are complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The increase, experts say, is not so much a result of
manufacturers raising prices on existing medicines as of patients
switching to newer medications that cost more. At the same time,
more prescriptions are being written, because the population is
aging and older people take more drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There is another possible explanation: advertising, according to
Steven Findlay of the National Institute for Healthcare Management
Foundation, a nonprofit research group. During campaign stops in
Florida and Oregon last week, Gore asserted, correctly, that many
drug companies spend more on marketing than on research. He singled
out one of the most widely advertised medications, Claritin, the
antihistamine made by Schering-Plough.
</P>
<P>
   Findlay is studying television advertising of prescription
medicines, which has flourished since the regulations were relaxed
three years ago. ``The numbers are quite compelling,'' he said.
``The drugs that are the most heavily advertised to consumers are
the ones that are driving the increase in spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Claritin alone, he said, accounted for 2.6 percent of the rise
in national prescription-drug spending last year. Another widely
advertised medicine, Celebrex, for arthritis, accounted for 7.4
percent of the increase.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures raise more questions: Are some people taking
costly prescription drugs when cheaper, over-the-counter ones will
do? If so, who? And how can they and their doctors be persuaded to
use medicines more cost-effectively?

<P>
   CORINTH, Vt. _ Signs in Vermont are usually sweet: ``Maple
Syrup,'' ``Farm Fresh Eggs,'' ``Country Crafts.'' But travelers
over the state's winding roads at this summer's end are likelier to
encounter signs proclaiming anger, backlash made visible: plain
square black-on-white placards, thousands of them, on barns and
garages and front porches, declaring ``Take Back Vermont.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop and inquire at houses displaying the signs in this poor
farming and logging region of central Vermont, and the translation
becomes clear: We are furious at our legislators for passing a law
this spring letting gay couples be joined in marriagelike civil
unions. We are mad about property tax reform, and all the permits
we need to log or build on our land, and all the other laws our
politicians pass against our will. We want to vote them out in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Civil unions are like the straw that broke the camel's back,''
said Ken Paronto, a retired machine shop owner here who has dangled
a Take Back Vermont sign from a tree above the road to his house
and plastered Take Back Vermont stickers on all four of his
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who post the signs agree that the fight over civil
unions has brought to a head the tension long rumbling between two
kinds of Vermonters: an old ``woodchuck'' type, usually a native,
often Republican and conservative; and a newer sort, usually a
``flatlander'' from out of state, often Democratic and liberal.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, the cause of the anger is the civil unions
law, and from editorial pages to country roads, this
campaign-season fight is getting nasty _ particularly in Orange and
Washington counties, where the signs are most widespread.
</P>
<P>
   In the towns of Corinth and Topsham, there is even a low-level
guerrilla war under way: Residents say their signs have been
stolen, defaced with pink triangles or other graffiti, or, in at
least one case, burned. Antigay graffiti has been painted on some
roads; so have the pink triangles, symbols of gay pride.
</P>
<P>
   Don't the vandals see, warned one resident on the Take Back
Vermont side, Elisa Howes, ``that they could be at the wrong house
at the wrong time stealing the wrong sign and end up getting
shot?''
</P>
<P>
   The tension has grown to the point that 168 residents recently
signed a letter, printed in the local paper, decrying ``the
divisiveness, hostility and mistrust we see overtaking our towns
since the passage of the civil unions law.'' They described ``a
climate of fear being created by people whose alarmist tactics
discourage rational debate'' and called for a return to ``a spirit
of community.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is not merely the signs, said Linda Weiss, a mail
carrier, justice of the peace, planning board chairwoman and school
board member who helped write the letter. It is the sense that
since the civil unions law, antigay sentiment in this town of about
1,240 people is rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so angry,'' said Weiss, a former New Yorker who has
lived here with her partner, Joyce McKeeman, for the last 10 years.
``They're filled with hostility and rage. It's scary to be in a
small room with them, or in a small town with them, frankly.'' In
particular, she said, she is concerned that local antigay
propaganda harps on claims that gay men and lesbians are out to
convert children and spread homosexuality. ``So suddenly it's not
about Linda and Joyce, the lesbians they know,'' Weiss said. ``It's
about `the homosexual agenda.'''
</P>
<P>
   For years, McKeeman said, she and Weiss had told friends what a
live-and-let-live state Vermont was, where they could be who they
were without worrying. ``And that's gone, that feeling is gone,''
she said. She wakes up at night fearing that someone could hate
them enough to come and attack them.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to any of the people who display the signs, and they deny
vehemently there is any hatred in the slogan. They tend to sound
like Dick Lambert, the dairy farmer from Washington, Vt., who came
up with the idea of printing the signs, and already has sold more
than 4,000 of them, at $5 each, in a state of just 600,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tolerant but they've got to see,'' Lambert said. ``We
don't go into their bedroom and tell them what to do, but don't
shove it down our throats.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the civil unions law but also to a hot topic
among the Take Back Vermont camp: a $12,000 state grant that went
to a program called Outright Vermont, which aims to train educators
and students about tolerance and safety for gay and lesbian
students. Many of the people who post the signs denounced the
program as tantamount to teaching homosexuality to children.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Appleton, a mother of four and a dairy farmer who painted
Take Back Vermont in giant letters across her roadside barn after a
sign she had posted was stolen, recently decided to take her
7-year-old daughter out of school and teach her at home, she said,
in part because of programs like Outright Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   In general, she said, she painted the sign because of ``the way
the government takes more control.'' She said she wants ``to get
politicians in there willing to listen to the people.'' And the
sign ``is not meant to bash anybody,'' she said. ``It's more
political.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs are, unquestionably, political. They tend to be paired
with signs backing Ruth Dwyer, a Republican candidate for governor,
who opposes civil unions. Gov. Howard Dean, a Democrat, spoke out
against the signs at a recent news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Dean asked if residents really wanted to take Vermont back to
the days of lax environmental rules, and to laws that made some
towns pay much higher property tax rates to support their schools
than others, and to ``a time when it was OK to discriminate against
people for a variety of reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't think we do want to take back Vermont to
those days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What other Vermonters think will be clear on Sept. 12, when the
state holds primaries that include challenges by several
conservatives to legislators who supported the civil unions law,
and in November.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could remember a time of such political tension in
Vermont, Lambert said, happily, ``Not since Ethan Allen and the
Green Mountain Boys,'' the colonial-era rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some here are already referring to a Take Back Vermont
``movement,'' though the signs seem to be spreading more through
word of mouth than any organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just taken off like wildfire,'' Lambert said after taking
a phone inquiry about the signs in his farmhouse kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The preponderance of old-time Vermonters in the Take Back
Vermont camp is not lost even on 13-year-old Tad Kingsbury, whose
mother put up a sign on their roadside house to protest what she
saw as the hypocrisy of local politicians who said they would
oppose civil unions and then voted for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who really don't like civil unions are the ones who
were born here and grew up here,'' Tad said. ``The ones who like it
are the ones who just moved here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some newspaper editorials have pointed out that the signs imply
that the political process that led to the civil unions law was
illegitimate. In fact, they say, the state Supreme Court was well
within its rights to rule last December that gay couples were being
discriminated against, and legislators were well within their
rights to pass the law in response.
</P>
<P>
   But such editorials do not dissuade people with the signs, like
Paronto, who said homosexuals should be tolerated but not allowed
to have impact on others: ``The good Lord made black and white, and
it doesn't turn into gray. Like the signs.''

   WASHINGTON _ The Bush campaign has dissolved into a whiny
puddle. The Austin team put out a press release Friday bawling that
Joe Lieberman was a big meanie to compare Gov. Bush to Barney
Rubble.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think, after the risible rift between Dan Quayle and
Murphy Brown, that Republicans would know better than to whinge
about fictional characters.
</P>
<P>
   W.'s attempt to be nasty and nice at the same time is so lame,
it's making me miss Lee Atwater. At least Atwater knew where he
wanted to be _ in the gutter.
</P>
<P>
   The cocky, jagged-edged strategist, a jogging partner and
political ally of W. during the '88 campaign, would have snickered
at the oxymoron some Bushies have used to describe the ad campaign
against Al Gore: soft negative.
</P>
<P>
   When Atwater ran Poppy's race against Michael Dukakis, he
bragged on a less euphemistic approach: ``Attack and destroy!''
</P>
<P>
   His fellow dark prince of strategy, Roger Ailes, who helped
Atwater turn Willie Horton into a bludgeon, was once asked by a
Time reporter if they had any qualms about using Horton in an ad.
``The only question,'' Ailes replied breezily, ``is whether we
depict Willie Horton with a knife in his hand or without it.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't insist that a scalding ad is soft without looking
foolish. Or, as W. himself so memorably put it after John McCain
attacked him in the primary: ``You can't take the high horse and
claim the low road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' new ad has a female narrator sarcastically
mocking Gore's image on TV as he says he ``took the initiative in
creating the Internet'' and as he hangs with Buddhist monks.
</P>
<P>
   The ad is designed to rip Gore's truthfulness and ethics. Yet on
Friday Bush defended it by parroting his aides' assertions that it
was merely ``humorous'' and ``tongue in cheek.''
</P>
<P>
   In two short weeks, W. and Al have switched roles, and it's
making the Bush campaign nuts. Al is now the sunny one, crowing to
The Washington Post that ``the wind is at our backs and it's
filling our sails.'' He's 10 points ahead, according to a Newsweek
poll. And he's now seen as smarter  &UR; and &LR;  better-looking than W.,
according to a Gallup poll, and also the one voters would rather
dine with. Thanks to the big smooch, women have finally cottoned to
the Democratic nominee. And suddenly W., who had been loftily
promising to restore civility to politics, seems like Slashing,
Opportunistic Guy.
</P>
<P>
   Thrown off his strut, W. veered between impatience and
sentimentality talking Friday to The New York Times' Alison
Mitchell and Frank Bruni, and grew misty over the ``amazing
experience'' of running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the cheap-shot ad, W. looks sulky about setting the
debates. The Bush family has a proud history of aversion to
debates, which don't suit them because of their curious
relationship with grammar and because they feel they should be
trusted to govern without having to prove themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something surreal in watching the candidate who is
so allergic to details dwelling on every detail of the debate
format, from the location (nothing adjacent to anything named after
a Democratic president) to the questioners (Larry King would be
best) to the furniture (a table instead of podiums would be nice).
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the dead weight known as Dick Cheney. Cheney
finally faced up to his potential conflict of interest, announcing
that, if elected, he would forfeit Halliburton stock options worth
about $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   He also released his tax returns, showing why $3.5 million was a
piddling sacrifice. His income went from $258,394 in 1992, when he
was the Bush secretary of defense who helped direct the Persian
Gulf war to save a ritzy gas station called Kuwait and keep
American oil prices down, to $4,423,289 in 1999, when he was an
avatar of Big Oil.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign might think about using that Cheney financial
statement in an ad. Cheney didn't fare too shabbily in the
Democratic economy. His annual income multiplied 17 times during
the Clinton-Gore administration. He got a whopping $20 million in
10 years and gave a measly 1 percent to charity.
</P>
<P>
   But you can see why the guy wants to give himself a bigger tax
cut.

<P>
   DUBROVNIK, Croatia _ The first seven months in power have been
sobering for President Stipe Mesic.
</P>
<P>
   He has been determined to bring Croatia into the European Union,
but the economy he inherited after the death of the former
president, Franjo Tudjman, is in seriously bad shape.
</P>
<P>
   He came into office promising an end to the nepotism and
corruption of the Tudjman government, but a court system used for
years as a political tool has not been strong or independent enough
to prosecute the law vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, the levels of corruption Mesic has uncovered from
the old government have far outstripped even his worst imaginings,
involving billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mesic said in a recent interview, the government is
investigating family members of the late president for abuse of
their position _ even though Tudjman is still honored by Croatians
as the man who founded their modern state with the breakup of
Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs to be accepted as criminal activity and prosecuted as
such,'' Mesic said. In particular, those who profited from the
privatization of the state enterprises of the old socialist economy
have to be brought to justice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mesic, a longtime opponent of the former president, said he did
not want to persecute the Tudjman family in particular. But, he
said, some family members _namely Tudjman's younger son, Stjepan,
his daughter Nevenka Kosutic, and even his wife, Ankica _ appeared
to have profited from their position and owned trust funds and
companies obtained under a privatization process that was never
open to public tender.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, he said, Tudjman's plan to create a wealthy class
of 200 rich families to lead Croatia was both catastrophic and
criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going after any family,'' he said. ``All I can say
is that no one will get an amnesty if they have done wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When he took office in February, Mesic found a room full of
thousands of documents and audio tapes _ apparently conversations
between Tudjman and his aides and ministers _ left behind in the
presidential building. The new president has readily passed those
tapes on to the press.
</P>
<P>
   They have provided this Balkan country of four and half million
people with a steady diet of sensational revelations on how Tudjman
and a small inner circle ran the country.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes have contained everything from how Tudjman apparently
discussed setting up front companies to disguise purchase of the
biggest daily newspaper, Vecernji List _ and so ensure its loyalty
to the regime _ to how to help an indicted war criminal evade
prosecution from the international tribunal at The Hague, to
discussing Tudjman's obsession with annexing the town of Banja Luka
in northern Bosnia, as late as last year.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of openness has brought a new mood to Croatians. Many
welcome the change brought on by Mesic, who has moved away from the
nationalist politics embraced to such disastrous effect by his
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   But although the transcripts of the tapes have made for good
reading, they may be insufficient as evidence, government officials
acknowledge. The new administration has made little headway so far
in bringing people to court and is learning that to prosecute the
corrupt or retrieve any of the money lost is going to be a long and
complex task.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about billions of dollars,'' said Deputy Prime
Minister Slavko Linic, who is responsible for economics and heads a
commission investigating corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Linic, the former opposition mayor of the port town, Rijeka,
said he was appalled to find just how indebted the country really
was, with hundreds of state companies bankrupt and unable to pay
their thousands of employees. Economists estimate between two and
six billion dollars have been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the economic trouble, Mesic, who was elected in a
landslide victory, remains quite popular. But in order to maintain
that support, he feels the need to deliver on his election promises
to end corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The government appears to be going after businessmen first. The
most notorious, Miroslav Kutle, who benefited from his job in the
privatization fund, came to own over 100 companies, from which he
promptly embezzled. While he is now in prison, two other prominent
figures detained recently by fraud investigators, have been
released, apparently for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The government has now inherited state companies that are more
indebted than ever, along with millions of dollars in outstanding
government loans that have to be written off. ``That's why the
portfolio of the state is in such a bad situation, it is without
value,'' Linic said.
</P>
<P>
   For the government, the most potent problem is the tens of
thousands of state workers the government cannot pay and who face
unemployment, which has already reached 20 percent. The state
employees whose jobs are now threatened in the bankrupt companies
represent another quarter of the work force, Linic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Croatian people are very angry and they expect to see
people in jail,'' he said. ``Everyone knows that some person is
responsible for the economy, and they ask that the government find
that person and put him in jail. And that is very important for the
government, but very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   One day recently, outside the government building on the
handsome St. Mark's Square, Matko Krizanac, a 55-year-old
unemployed doctor, stood holding two crumpled banners protesting
the loss of his savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing is the helplessness,'' he said. ``The
government and the justice system do not function. The government
says it's been robbed, but it is incapable of fighting crime,'' he
nearly shouted. ``People are already saying this government is the
same as the old government.''

   Tough Ad Campaign Takes on the Favorite
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke of Washington, a Democrat, is favored to win a
second term this fall whatever the outcome of the Republican
primary next Saturday. But Republicans haven't surrendered yet,
anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, even before they have a nominee (it will probably be
John Carlson, a former radio talk show host), they are broadcasting
advertisements attacking Locke. And very tough advertisements they
are, as tough as any being run in the country, designed to give the
Republican primary winner a quick boost.
</P>
<P>
   By indirection, they appear to link Locke to the death of a girl
under the protection of the state's welfare department by accusing
him of bad management of the department and indifference to the
state's methamphetamine problem. The child was beaten to death by
her mother, a drug addict, the police say.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, sponsored by the Washington State Republican
Party and featuring pictures of the child and drug paraphernalia,
never actually call for Locke's defeat and party officials say they
were not produced or paid for with the knowledge of either
Republican primary contender. Thus, they qualify as ``issue ads''
and are not subject to normal campaign spending restrictions. But
however they ended up on the air, their message seems unmistakable:
had Locke been a better manager and had he pushed for tougher drug
laws, the child would still be alive.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the advertisements, viewers hear nothing about
Locke's re-election. Rather, they are simply urged to call his
office about what they have just seen, a standard format for issue
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Locke has called the advertisements not only lies but ``an
appalling tactic.'' But the Republican state chairman, Don Benton,
contends they simply point out the governor's ``lack of
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after the advertisements began running, Carlson, the
Republican primary favorite, began attacking Locke on the drug
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is coincidental on this one,'' Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   Poll Rates Candidates On Brains and Humor
</P>
<P>
   The latest presidential preference poll by Gallup, like most
recent preference polls, has George W. Bush and Al Gore virtually
tied, 46 percent for Bush and 45 percent for Gore. But this time
Gallup had some other questions, too, and here's what voters
 &UR; really &LR;  think:
</P>
<P>
   Gore is smarter and better looking but Bush is a better speaker
and has a better sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Although most men and women agreed that Gore was smarter, when
it came to who was the better speaker, most men said Bush but women
were closely divided between Bush and Gore. Women also were closely
divided over who had the better sense of humor, while most men
stuck with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly two of every three women said Gore was the most
handsome. And men generally agreed, though two of every five
insisted they had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Who would be the better dinner partner? Most men chose Bush
while most women favored Gore.
</P>
<P>
   What's it all mean, if anything?
</P>
<P>
   Frank Newport, Gallup's executive editor, noted that Gore has
been working hard to change his wardrobe and his speaking style,
while Bush has been forced to contend with the smartness issue.
``Voters certainly take into account these ephemeral, nonissue
related measures,'' Newport said.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, covering 1,019 adults, was taken last weekend and has
a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy at Center Of New Political Spat
</P>
<P>
   Remember the incident in which Rep. Loretta Sanchez, a Democrat
from Southern California's 46th Congressional District, took so
much heat over scheduling a fund-raiser at the Los Angeles Playboy
Mansion that she retreated to an innocuous film studio hall _ and
then withdrew in a huff as a Democratic National Convention
speaker?
</P>
<P>
   Comes now Playboy redux . . .
</P>
<P>
   Christie Hefner, Hugh's daughter and chief executive of Playboy
Enterprises, is helping Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri, a moderate
Democrat, raise money for his effort to unseat Sen. John Ashcroft,
a freshman Republican and hard-right Christian conservative.
Ashcroft says Carnahan is ``chasing sex money'' and has demanded
that he cut his ties to Hefner and give back any money raised by
her.
</P>
<P>
   Such an unholy alliance, the senator contends, is ``an insult to
the values of every Missouri family that wants to protect its
children from the pornography pushed into their homes by outfits
like Playboy.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's reply: He'll keep any money collected with Hefner
because there is ``nothing scandalous'' about it. He says the
senator should ``come down off his high horse and stop his
sanctimonious, negative and hypocritical smear campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hefner?
</P>
<P>
   She says she does not presume that Carnahan's acceptance of her
support represents a Playboy endorsement but she does presume that
``the overwhelming majority of Missourians know Playboy as a
magazine of high editorial quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The race is tight, regarded as one of the three or four most
crucial to control of the Senate. The sex-and-money angle has
captured some headlines but there is no real indication of how it
is playing with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Examining Life, Jerry Brown-Style
</P>
<P>
   Here's an update on Mayor Jerry Brown of Oakland, Calif., a k a
Governor Moonbeam from two decades back when he was the dreamy
philosopher governor of the Golden State, sometimes living in a box
(or close to it) but always thinking outside of it.
</P>
<P>
   Make that meditating outside it.
</P>
<P>
   He's not running for president now, having failed three times.
Rather, he is struggling like any other big-city mayor to remake
the down-at-the-heels parts of his town _ and enjoying some
successes.
</P>
<P>
   But New Age guy that he is, he also has this nonprofit ``We The
People'' communal thing going in the warehouse he lives in down
near the Oakland waterfront, offering yoga and tai chi classes for
all who need to get better in touch with themselves, or whatever.
As his advertisement in a local paper puts it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Come and learn how yoga enhances your flexibility, strength
and balance. You will walk away feeling energized and mindfully
centered.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but the School of Sustainability, an environmental
project, didn't make it. And, alas, the rooftop garden is no longer
a cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   But for the next five weeks, there will be free lectures and
seminars on 21st-century city living or, as the mayor put it in The
San Francisco Chronicle, there will be free-range discussion of
``what the modern world is doing to people, doing to our
consciousness, our sense of who we are and what it means to be
human.'' He promises the discussion leaders will be a smorgasbord
of provocative social historians, architects, linguists, even
mathematicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aristotle says the unexamined life is not worth living,''
Brown explains. ``So we're examining.''

BURMA LEADER FORCED HOME; STANDOFF ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ In a sudden midnight raid, nearly 200 riot
police surrounded the car where Myanmar's pro-democracy leader had
been stranded by the roadside for a week and forced her and her
companions to return home, one of her aides said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat said security forces then sealed off the
political headquarters of the leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and
apparently searched it and removed documents.
</P>
<P>
   The forceful action brought to an abrupt end an attempt by Suu
Kyi, 55, to publicize the restrictions on her political movement by
attempting to drive from the capital of the former Burma to meet
with her supporters in another town.
</P>
<P>
   Her two-car convoy, in which she was accompanied by 14
supporters, was halted _ as similar forays have been in the past _
creating a standoff in the small town of Dala, just south of the
capital, Yangon.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi refused to leave her car and set up camp by the side of
the road. Her party, the National League for Democracy, issued a
statement saying she would hold out ``until she reaches her
destination and accomplishes her party organizational duties.''
</P>
<P>
   Her aide, U Tin Oo, told reporters that he assumed she had been
returned to her home. But his interview with local reporters was
cut short before he could say much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around midnight, nearly 200 riot police raided the place where
we were staying and forcibly took Aung San Suu Kyi and all of us,''
said Tin Oo, who is her chief deputy as party leader.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials could not be reached by telephone Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Though Suu Kyi failed, as expected, to meet with her supporters,
her attempt succeeded in reviving international attention to the
suppression of her political rights. It drew statements of concern
from several nations as well as from the U.N. secretary-general,
Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar's military leaders accused her of a political stunt in
advance of a session this month of the U.N. General Assembly and a
meeting in December at which the main European and Southeast Asian
political groupings are expected to discuss their relations with
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   Both the European Union and the most liberal member of the Asian
grouping, Thailand, issued statements criticizing the government's
actions.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Saturday, the Myanmar government maintained its
somewhat mocking tone toward the standoff, which it has portrayed
as a pleasant outing in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Under the headline ``Dala Incident Ends Happily,'' it said:
``Daw Suu Kyi, her travel companions and all their attendants
arrived home safe and sound this morning after their eight days of
stay in Dala town.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that her party had complained of the conditions in the
swampy and mosquito-ridden area, the statement said: ``The
government acknowledged their complaints and on Sept. 2 at 1:30
a.m., Daw Suu Kyi and her travel companions were escorted back to
their respective residences in Yangon in a motorcade facilitated by
the government for their safe and convenient return.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff was the latest confrontation between Suu Kyi and
the military junta that took power in 1988 after suppressing a
nationwide pro-democracy uprising.
</P>
<P>
   She was placed under house arrest the next year, but her party
overwhelmingly won a parliamentary election in 1990, only to see
the government set aside the results and remain in power. She won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   She was released from house arrest in 1995, but her activities
since then have remained severely curtailed, and she has not been
permitted to travel outside the capital, formerly known as Rangoon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Annan called on the government to try to resolve
the long-running political stalemate through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary-general believes that the latest situation
underlines the necessity for national reconciliation and urges the
two sides to engage, as soon as possible, in a substantive
political dialogue,'' said Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
   But in a series of statements, Myanmar's leaders maintained
their hard line against Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Foreign Minister U Win Aun portrayed her action in
sinister terms, saying she hoped to draw an aggressive response
from her foreign supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she would like to see is the government to arrest her,
thinking her arrest could create anarchy in the country, and
eventually expecting foreign intervention,'' he said.

home was gone. And when he found his youngest daughter floating in

family. For the 100th anniversary of the Great Storm of Sept. 8,
1900, we tell the story of the Ratisseaus of Galveston, who
suffered perhaps the greatest loss in the hurricane that remains
the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States.

   STATEOFSOUTH _ CHAPEL HILL, N.C. - A new report analyzing the
South recommends a politically dicey approach to spreading
prosperity across the region: Nurturing the already-booming New
Economy cities, such as Atlanta and Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill,
because their prosperity ripples to outlying communities. For
decades, the notion of government and business nurturing its strong
cities has been a sore spot among rural area and their politicians.
But noting that ``the challenge before Southerners is at once
sweeping and exhilarating,'' MDC says, ``It is to ensure that the
region's prospering places and people continue to thrive, while
helping the people and places that are falling further behind gain
the capacity to adapt and flourish in a rapidly changing economy.''

   LABOR _ WASHINGTON _ On Labor Day 1900, the typical American
wage earner was a hardened working man, accustomed to toiling 10
hours a day, six days a week on the farm or in the factory. Still,
optimism was rampant as new technologies stirred hopes for better
days. Electric lights, telephones, trolley cars and even
automobiles were appearing, giving rise to the belief that work
soon would be easier. Those 1900 dreams have become our reality. On
Labor Day 2000, U.S. workers are healthier, safer and have more
buying power than at any time in history. (Geewax, Cox News

   OXFORD _ OXFORD, Ga. _ J.P. Godfrey Jr. thought he had left
``separate but equal'' behind when he joined the Air Force in 1952.
But upon returning home decades later, he found vestiges of
segregation in Oxford, 35 miles east of downtown Atlanta. The
Newton County town is home to 2,000 people, including the 600-plus
at Oxford College. ``I have always been quite fond of this old
place,'' said Godfrey, 63, whose grandparents cultivated corn and
cotton there. ``My grandfather was proud of the fact that he owned
property. He used to say, `When you own a foot of land, you own
something.' `` Soon after arriving six years ago, Godfrey searched
for his grandparents' graves at Oxford's only cemetery. ``I
couldn't find them,'' he said, so he began making queries.
Godfrey's questions stirred ghosts from Oxford's past, entangling
the city in a debate over the sins of a bygone era, the cemetery's
future and a pile of money. (Gentry, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

hosannahing around the country as if they were caught up in a Great

   EDITORIAL-BOOKMAN _ ATLANTA _ It wasn't government-sponsored
religious persecution, but it was too close for comfort. A few
years ago, while covering the Georgia Legislature, I happened to be
sitting alone in the press gallery early one morning, reading
through the bills filed the day before. On the other side of the
glass partition, legislators were milling about the House chamber,
waiting for the day's session to begin. Over the intercom, I heard
the unmistakable tone of a minister up at the podium, about to
offer the traditional morning prayer. So I set down my papers and
bowed my head, and when the prayer ended, I resumed my work. A few
minutes later, out in the hallway, I was accosted by a red-faced
House usher. ``Somebody saw you back there,'' he told me, waving an
angry finger in my face. ``You have to stand up during the prayer.
If you don't stand up, you're not going to be allowed back in that
chamber.'' (Bookman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED FRIDAY.

   TV-CHILDSTARS _ ``Child Stars: Their Story,'' which airs Sept. 4

go into show business. Sure, the potential for huge paydays is
tempting. But is the price that must be paid for that possible
fortune worth it? Child stars, for instance, are often robbed of a
normal childhood. Growing up is hard enough. Imagine having to do
it in front of millions of people watching your every move or
snickering about every goofy-looking pimple you get. The pressure
to perform is also insanely intense. Many adult actors can't even
take the heat and often resort to drugs and alcohol to cope. Just
think what it's like for a kid to overhear a producer angrily
talking about low ratings and possible cancellation. And in a
business where rejection is the norm, just what kind of toll does
that take on a child's psyche? (Thompson, Palm Beach Post). MOVED

bites as well as an agonizing struggle with multiple myeloma, a
bone marrow cancer. And so, when the 46-year-old McLaurin was
diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus a few months ago, he was
well prepared to die. He had lived a full life, he told himself. An
ex-Marine who had kicked a debilitating drinking habit after 20
years, he had been married and divorced twice, had two teenage
children, and had worked as a Peace Corps volunteer in Tunisia. ``I
wondered if . . . it was time for me to die . . . to chronicle that

advantage for a change. Although roughly half of the anticipated
sellout crowd of 51,000 will be cheering for Guatemala, they will
be relegated to the upper half of the stadium. The U.S. Soccer
Federation made a concerted effort to sell American fans the better

limit the abuse they are subjected to at home when playing a Latin
American opponent. (Parker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   EAST
</P>
<P>
   1. Indianapolis Colts
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 13-3
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: A three-headed monster on offense with quarterback
Peyton Manning, receiver Marvin Harrison and running back Edgerrin
James. There is, however, much more. An offensive line effective at
both run and pass blocking. A complete tight end in Ken Dilger.
Strong return and cover teams. The top-ranked offense in the
American Conference last season that was pivotal in turning a 3-13
team in '98 into a 13-3 team in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: The Colts seek a championship defense. The defense
last season on any given day ranged from superior to lousy. Not
enough turnovers created and too many holes in the run defense _
the Colts last season allowed an average of 4.2 yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Playoffs, a certainty. Super Bowl, a shot.
</P>
<P>
   2. New England Patriots
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 8-8
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: The new coach, Bill Belichick, knows the division
better than most, and it is his preparation and in-game adjustments
that should help lift the Patriots. Quarterback Drew Bledsoe
appears rejuvenated, and that is much required: Bledsoe threw 21
interceptions last season and only 19 touchdown passes. Watch
safety Lawyer Milloy, cornerback Ty Law and linebacker Willie
McGinest produce Pro Bowl seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Who will be the source of the running game? Kevin
Faulk is a big back who now is required to take a big step. The
rookie J.R. Redmond hopes to provide speed around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: New England will play a crisper game under Belichick. A
smarter one, too.
</P>
<P>
   3. Buffalo Bills
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 11-5
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Winning quarterbacks in Rob Johnson and Doug Flutie.
Ted Cottrell, the defensive coordinator, designer of the league's
top-ranked defense last season. Reliable running game and dynamic
receiver in Eric Moulds.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Definitive leadership is gone in Bruce Smith,
Thurman Thomas and Kurt Schulz. New leadership must emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: No miracles required to return to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   4. New York Jets
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 8-8
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Curtis Martin. He is a special player, capable of
churning inside for tough yards and bouncing outside for big gains.
He is a performance-oriented leader. Linebackers Mo Lewis and Bryan
Cox help to set the tone on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: A horrific schedule. It starts with Green Bay, New
England, Buffalo and Tampa Bay. Also, will the Jets replace
Keyshawn Johnson's big plays at receiver? And how will they respond
to adversity under the new head coach, Al Groh?
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   5. Miami Dolphins
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 9-7
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Miami has one of the best defensive lines in the
league, anchored by tackles Daryl Gardener and Tim Bowens and ends
Jason Taylor and Trace Armstrong; their backups are also good.
Cornerback Sam Madison is a Pro Bowl talent. Linebacker Zach Thomas
is fiery and tenacious. The new head coach, Dave Wannstedt, knows
how to teach defense. Olindo Mare, the place-kicker, missed on only
5 of 44 field-goal attempts last season.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Quarterback. Dan Marino is gone. The replacements,
Jay Fiedler and Damon Huard, look average.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: A pesky, late-season playoff spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   1. Tennessee Titans
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 13-3
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: The quarterback (Steve McNair), the running back
(Eddie George), the new receiver (Carl Pickens), the tight end
(Frank Wycheck), the defensive end (Jevon Kearse) and the head
coach (Jeff Fisher). Tennessee, the Super Bowl runner-up, is
loaded. And experienced. This is a bunch who won road playoff games
last season against Indianapolis and Jacksonville on their way to
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Can the Titans throw the ball downfield and put
pressure on opponents with more big-play offense?
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: If Tennessee remains focused, it can be the class of
the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   2. Jacksonville Jaguars
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 14-2
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Mark Brunell at quarterback ensures that Jacksonville
is a contender, though injuries have plagued him in recent seasons.
Fred Taylor at running back is one of the league's best. Few
receivers have been as dependable as Jimmy Smith. And the addition
of linebacker Hardy Nickerson, in from Tampa Bay, gives the defense
a nastier bite.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: This has not been a mentally tough team in the
playoffs. Two years ago the Jaguars fell apart in a playoff game
against the Jets. They did it again last year against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: No question, a playoff club. But where is this team's
head?
</P>
<P>
   3. Baltimore Ravens
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 8-8
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Ray Lewis is back, and that is good news for the
defense. He leads a linebacking crew second to none in the league.
Quarterback Tony Banks showed promise last season and looks for
more. Shannon Sharpe, in from Denver, anchors the tight end
position.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Consistency from the offense, which ranked 30th in
its red zone attack last season.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Bright.
</P>
<P>
   4. Cincinnati Bengals
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 4-12
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Akili Smith to the rookie receiver Peter Warrick.
This combination has the potential to be the signature one in the
league this season. Running back Corey Dillon is valuable and
exciting, too. Tremain Mack led the conference in kickoff-return
average (27.1) last season.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: The Bengals ranked last in average points (28.8)
allowed per game last season.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Encouraging. At least the Bengals will be more fun to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   5. Pittsburgh Steelers
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 6-10
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Jason Gildon, Levon Kirkland and Earl Holmes are part
of a linebacking group that keeps the Steelers competitive. Back
Jerome Bettis still runs hard, and the rookie receiver Plaxico
Burress, who looked awfully green in the preseason, will catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Quarterback. Kent Graham is the starter, Kordell
Stewart the backup. It was supposed to be the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Are the Steelers facing their third straight season
without a playoff berth? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Cleveland Browns
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 2-14
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Quarterback Tim Couch and receiver Kevin Johnson.
Especially Johnson. Both players were rookies last year, but it
appeared Johnson caught on at his position more quickly than Couch
did. Linebacker Jamir Miller exhibits hustle and toughness.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Better pass protection needed; their quarterbacks
were sacked 60 times last season, most in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: An expansion team in its second year still building.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   WEST
</P>
<P>
   1. Oakland Raiders
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 8-8
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Receiver Tim Brown, who in his 13th season runs
better than some in their first; he caught 90 passes last year.
Inside running from Tyrone Wheatley and breakaway running from
Napoleon Kaufman. And the wondrous cornerback Charles Woodson, who
this season will see action as a wide receiver, too. The new
kicker, the first-round draft pick Sebastian Janikowski, is
expected to make a difference, and indications are that he will.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Rich Gannon at quarterback is capable, but is he
championship-caliber? The Raiders need more punch from their
kickoff returns, where they averaged only 18.7 yards a return, 30th
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The Raiders should enter the playoffs for the first
time in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   2. Denver Broncos
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 6-10
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: The return of running back Terrell Davis and
linebacker John Mobley. Both were injured and missed most of last
season. Quarterback Brian Griese will improve from an awkward
start. The offensive line, with the 12th-year guard Mark Schlereth,
is active, mobile and effective. Rod Smith and Ed McCaffrey are
supported at receiver by the free-agent finds Andre Reed from
Buffalo and Robert Brooks, out of retirement from Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Griese's inexperience and the possible rustiness of
key players returning from injuries. Watch the development of the
new defensive ends Lester Archambeau from Atlanta and Kavika
Pittman from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: A playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   3. Kansas City Chiefs
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 9-7
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: His peers marvel at his athleticism at tight end, but
Tony Gonzalez believes he has only lightly tapped his talent. Last
season he caught 76 passes and 11 were touchdowns. This season he
could catch 100 balls and score 20 touchdowns. The Chiefs ran the
ball (521 carries) more than any other team last season. They also
led the league in turnover differential (plus 21) and scored nine
defensive touchdowns. They missed the playoffs in a season finale,
an overtime loss at home to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Overcoming the death of linebacker Derrick Thomas is
difficult. Keeping quarterback Elvis Grbac healthy is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: A teetering season.
</P>
<P>
   4. Seattle Seahawks
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 9-7
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: The venerable running back Ricky Watters (eighth
season) gains an exciting backup in the rookie Shaun Alexander from
Alabama. The Seattle secondary features a supreme cover man, Shawn
Springs, and a new safety, Reggie Tongue, in from Kansas City. The
Seahawks led the league in interceptions last season with 30 and
allowed 18.6 points a game, eighth best in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Quarterback Jon Kitna led a team that was 8-2 at the
start but finished 1-5. The Seahawks won the division and a playoff
berth in bizarre fashion, losing in their finale at the Jets and
then watching on television in the locker room as the Chiefs lost
to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Capable of winning the division, but, with Kitna, looks
like a waffling team.
</P>
<P>
   5. San Diego Chargers
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 8-8
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: The new receiver Curtis Conway, in from Chicago. A
flexible second-year head coach in Mike Riley. An indispensable
linebacker in Junior Seau. One of the league's best run-stuffing
defenses (only 82.6 rushing yards allowed per game last season).
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Turning the team over to quarterback Ryan Leaf is
like juggling a grenade.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Scary.

NFC SCOUTING REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST
</P>
<P>
   1. Washington Redskins
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 10-6
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: The off-season spending spree of the principal owner
Daniel Snyder has been well chronicled, as it should be. No team
has done more to improve itself so quickly. Deion Sanders bolsters
the secondary and provides a threat on punt returns. Bruce Smith is
still a solid pass rusher. The rookie left tackle Chris Samuels may
be one of the best draft picks of the past five years. This team
has stocked the cupboard.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Getting all that talent to mesh may take several
games. There is also a budding quarterback controversy between the
starter, Brad Johnson, and the backup Jeff George. Snyder is the
other X factor. If the team stumbles early, will he erupt the way
George Steinbrenner has?
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: This team has 12 victories written all over it.
Washington is definitely a Super Bowl contender. If Snyder can
control his temper, and coach Norv Turner can blend all the talent,
the Redskins may be practically unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   2. New York Giants
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 7-9
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: ``You know what our biggest asset is?'' Giants
linebacker Jessie Armstead asked. ``Everybody is picking us to win
two games. We're going to sneak up on people.'' Not with running
back Ron Dayne, who has all the stealth of a snowplow. Armstead is
of course exaggerating _ in fact, some prognosticators think the
Giants will make the playoffs. Dayne gives them a solid ground game
and ball control, and quarterback Kerry Collins is one of the
pleasant surprises in football. And, please, don't worry about a
quiet preseason from Armstead and the Pro Bowler Michael Strahan.
When the games begin, they will turn it on.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: A big one _ the secondary. Cornerback Jason Sehorn
is playing extremely well, but Sehorn and safety Sam Garnes are the
only reliable faces among the defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The Giants are a playoff team. They have the talent.
But their situation is precarious. For the first time in decades
the team may rely on the offense to carry it. What will keep the
team from advancing deep into the postseason are the gaping holes
in the defensive backfield.
</P>
<P>
   3. Philadelphia Eagles
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 5-11
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Quarterback Donovan McNabb is a talented passer, and
Duce Staley rushed for 1,273 yards last season. Staley should only
get better because in the off-season the Eagles signed the free
agent Jon Runyan, a 330-pound blocking terror.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: The Eagles don't have a big-time wide receiver,
which means teams will load up the line of scrimmage to stop Staley
and blitz McNabb.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The Eagles will push the division and can be one of the
league's surprise teams. How far they go will depend on McNabb.
</P>
<P>
   4. Arizona Cardinals
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 6-10
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Jake Plummer played most of last season with a
sprained thumb on his passing hand, and it led to his horrid year.
Plummer's nine touchdowns and 24 interceptions shattered his
confidence. But only temporarily. He has spent this off-season in
the film room and has been working out relentlessly. Look for
Plummer to regain his 1998 form. The rookie running back Thomas
Jones looks like the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Wideout is the big question mark. The team lost
receiver Rob Moore to a torn left anterior cruciate ligament in the
third preseason game against Minnesota. Arizona's pass rush remains
weak. The defense allowed 24 points a game last season, and the
front office has done little to improve it.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: As Plummer goes so do the Cardinals. If Plummer makes
bad decisions this season as he did last season, the offense will
struggle again. But if Plummer plays smarter, Arizona can be a
threat.
</P>
<P>
   5. Dallas Cowboys
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 8-8
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Adding wide receiver Joey Galloway was a brilliant
move. He can stretch a defense, and now the Cowboys have to get him
to go across the middle consistently. Dat Nguyen is a smallish
linebacker who does nothing but make big plays. Leon Lett is still
a factor at defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Quarterback Troy Aikman is still great, and it is
silly to say he is a soft spot on the team. Injuries and
inexperience have made the defensive back situation so dire that
Dallas lured the former Giant cornerback Phillippi Sparks out of
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The Cowboys as we know them are dead. Their backs ache,
their knees are creaking and they are a step too slow. Their salary
cap situation is a mess and no one fears them anymore. They have
one last shot to make a run at a championship. It's just that, in
all probability, that door has already been slammed shut.
</P>
<P>
   CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   1. Tampa Bay Buccaneers
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 11-5
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: The defense remains championship caliber, and in what
falls under the scary thought department, the Pro Bowl defensive
lineman Warren Sapp believes he will play even better. Fullback
Mike Alstott, who averaged nearly 4 yards a carry last year, is the
most punishing runner in football. Oh, and the Bucs have this guy
named Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: You have to reach to find them. Quarterback Shaun
King is still largely inexperienced and left tackle Jason Odom is
coming off back surgery. The Buccaneers are sometimes too
conservative on offense.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Tampa Bay averaged only 16.9 points a game, 28th in the
league, and still made it to the NFC championship game. Now the
team adds the spectacular Johnson, so it will be much better. Tampa
Bay, with a smart head coach in Tony Dungy, a great defense and
Johnson, could easily reach the Super Bowl. The only two things
that can stop them are injuries or jealousy from other wide
receivers when Johnson starts catching all those passes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Minnesota Vikings
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 10-6
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: People in Minnesota fret more about the Vikings'
quarterback situation than they do the latest words from Gov. Jesse
Ventura. Memories are short. It was 1998 when Randall Cunningham
left his construction business, stepped into the Vikings' offense
and went to the Pro Bowl. A year later, Jeff George, who was Ryan
Leaf before there was Ryan Leaf, won 9 of 12 starts. Jim McMahon,
Warren Moon and Brad Johnson all threw for a billion yards. In
other words, it's the system. Daunte Culpepper, the new starter,
will be just fine. That's because he has Randy Moss and Cris Carter
to throw to.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: The usual for the Vikings _ defense. It helped when
they signed the free agent cornerback Cris Dishman, but they must
still score 25 points a game because that is what's going to be
racked up against them.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Coach Dennis Green will put Culpepper in a position to
win. In his eight seasons Green has never had a losing record, and
his teams have made the playoffs seven times.
</P>
<P>
   3. Detroit Lions
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 8-8
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Barry Sanders is playing golf. No problem. Detroit
signed the former Jacksonville runner James Stewart to a five-year,
$25 million deal, and his quickness has surprised teammates.
Charlie Batch remains one of the most underrated throwers in
football. The offensive line is excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Defense is the problem. There is no depth, and the
secondary is average. The schedule is brutal. Besides the rugged
division games, the Lions play Washington, at Indianapolis, at the
Giants and at the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: If Batch and Stewart can stay healthy _ and those are
big questions _ the Lions can make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   4. Green Bay Packers
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 8-8
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: The offense will be less predictable. Wide receiver
Antonio Freeman reported to camp 10 pounds lighter. He's hungry,
just not for pepperoni pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Quarterback Brett Favre is simply wearing out. Last
year he threw 22 interceptions because of a badly sprained thumb.
This season, he already has a sore throwing elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: When he's healthy, Favre remains one of the most
dangerous players in football. If Coach Mike Sherman can control
Favre's wild tendencies and freelancing on the field, the Packers
can get 10 victories.
</P>
<P>
   5. Chicago Bears
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 6-10
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: The team added a premier defensive end by signing
Phillip Daniels from Seattle. He's the biggest star on a mediocre
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: The often injured, often bizarre Curtis Enis is
still not a premier running back. Quarterback Cade McNown is not a
natural pocket passer, but he is being asked to be one in Chicago's
offense. In the last preseason game, against Tennessee, Titans
quarterback Steve McNair completed 13 straight passes against
Chicago's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Don't buy into the hype that the Bears have completely
turned things around. McNown is solid, but there are too many other
holes on this team. Chicago remains a few seasons from contending.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   WEST
</P>
<P>
   1. St. Louis Rams
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 13-3
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Speed and depth. Trent Green is the backup
quarterback, and he could start for any other team. Running back
Marshall Faulk is the most underrated weapon in football. The
offensive line played well in the preseason, and the defense is the
fastest in the division. Players love coach Mike Martz. There are
few holes.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Only a few. When an opponent looks down the schedule
and sees the Rams, it will look at that game as the biggest of the
year. That is a tremendous burden and the reason repeating as Super
Bowl champion is so difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: This team will easily capture the division. It will
also make a strong run at another Super Bowl trip. One piece of
good news for the team is that quarterback Kurt Warner, last year's
Super Bowl MVP, has remained levelheaded despite his newfound fame.
</P>
<P>
   2. Atlanta Falcons
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 5-11
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Dan Reeves is extremely suspect as a talent evaluator
_ he just cut his first draft pick as general manager of the
Falcons in 1997, cornerback Michael Booker _ but he is a great head
coach. Tim Dwight is emerging as more than a speed burner; he is
now a complete player. Running back Jamal Anderson is back from
last year's season-ending knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: This team is built around two frail stars. When
Anderson was lost with a torn right anterior cruciate ligament, the
Falcons went into free fall, going from 14-2 to only five
victories. It is unrealistic to think Anderson can return to prime
form this season. Quarterback Chris Chandler was sacked 32 times
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: If Anderson and Chandler stay healthy, the Falcons will
compete for a playoff spot. Atlanta is taking a huge gamble by
starting a rookie, Travis Claridge, at right tackle. Basically,
there are a lot of ifs for the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   3. Carolina Panthers
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 8-8
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: The defensive line of Jason Peter, Sean Gilbert, Tim
Morabito, and Chuck Smith should be solid. The Panthers also added
Reggie White and Eric Swann. Quarterback Steve Beuerlein had a
career season in '99 and should be solid again. The running back
who has the most vowels in his name, Tshimanga Biakabutuka, if he
stays healthy, will gain at least 1,200 yards. George Seifert is
always forgotten when names of top head coaches are mentioned, but
he is a brilliant tactician.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: The Panthers will not be able to sneak up on people
as they did in the final half of last season, when Carolina won
five of eight. The team also showed it had a major flaw _ suspect
cornerbacks _ and did nothing this off-season to correct the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Anyone who believes the Panthers are a playoff team is
being a bit premature.
</P>
<P>
   4. New Orleans Saints
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 3-13
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Quarterback Jeff Blake throws a nice deep ball. Wide
receivers Jake Reed and Joe Horn are not household names but are
solid. Willie Roaf is a premier left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: An overall lack of special players. The former
coach, Mike Ditka, after trading his entire 1998 draft for Ricky
Williams, has left this team in a world of pain.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: It is between New Orleans and San Francisco as to which
team will be the sorriest in the division.
</P>
<P>
   5. San Francisco 49ers
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 4-12
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Good young receivers in Terrell Owens and J.J.
Stokes.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: San Francisco cornerbacks were torched last year.
The team made some improvements by letting go Mark McMillian, R.W.
McQuarters and Darnell Walker, but any thought that the secondary
will make dramatic leaps is a silly one.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The 49ers are in salary cap purgatory, Steve Young
retired, and coach Steve Mariucci must deal with the aging
superstar Jerry Rice. That all adds up to three victories.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sultry air will cover most areas from the eastern Plains to the
Atlantic Seaboard on Sunday. The day will begin with areas of dense
fog in the East Coast states, which will yield to occasional hazy
sunshine at midday and in the afternoon. As the sun heats the humid
air, scattered showers and thunderstorms will form from southern
New England to the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Weak winds aloft will
result in some slow-moving thunderstorms with torrential rain and
localized flooding. The greatest chance for heavy rain will be near
a low pressure zone in Alabama, Georgia and the Florida panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and thunderstorms will occur as low pressure moves slowly
east across the Great Lakes states. Meanwhile, sunny and hot
weather will persist in much of the southern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, cool and unsettled conditions will linger in
northern sections. The Southwest will be sunny and seasonably hot.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WHEN SUMMER ENDS
</P>
<P>
   Although Labor Day weekend is the traditional end of the summer
season, there is no end in sight to the searing heat in parts of
the South. Despite the lingering heat, among the keepers of
official climatological records, summer in the northern hemisphere
ended on Aug. 31, which is the last day of the three warmest months
of the year. Astronomers, sticklers for precision, will declare an
end to summer at 1:27 p.m. EDT on Sept. 22, when the direct rays of
the noontime sun shift into the Southern Hemisphere.

ORGANIZERS SAY PARADE GOERS WILL GRUDGINGLY ACCEPT BAN ON ALCOHOL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Organizers of the West Indian American Carnival
Parade said that revelers would accept _ if grudgingly _ a ban on
alcohol at the festivities Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Police Department will increase its presence
at the parade to enforce the restrictions, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not happy, but we are going along,'' said Carlos
Lezama, president of the West Indian American Day Carnival
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The parade is one of the most popular ethnic celebrations in New
York City, drawing roughly 2 million people to Brooklyn each Labor
Day. But preparations have been peppered with unpleasantness in
recent weeks. Early last month, the city announced a ban on alcohol
sales at all outdoor festivals, including parades, restrictions
that have been in effect at the St. Patrick's Day Parade in
Manhattan for years. This angered West Indian American Carnival
Parade organizers, who said such a ban would cause many of the
sponsors to drop out.
</P>
<P>
   Their anger increased when the city backed down somewhat on that
ban, saying that the Feast of San Gennaro, an 11-day festival in
Little Italy that starts later this month, would be allowed to sell
alcohol, although with a reduced number of vendors. It is not yet
clear how the city will handle restrictions on alcohol at
subsequent festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Parade and community leaders argued that the inconsistency was
unfair and strongly hinted that race played a role in the policy
decision, a charge Mayor Rudolph Giuliani firmly denied. The ban on
alcohol was largely inspired by the disorder following the National
Puerto Rican Day parade in June, when more than 50 women were
sexually attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is tunnel vision enforcement of what may be a good
provision,'' said Rep. Major Owens of Brooklyn. ``The community
thinks it is being unfairly treated, but everyone is ready to
cooperate. What matters is that the festival be preserved.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another point of discord emerged when members of three steel
drum bands planning to compete for prize money during events
leading up to the parade were evicted from their practice site late
last month. The landlord of the building housing a warehouse on
Parkside Avenue in Brooklyn said that the groups had not paid rent
to store their equipment and practice there, and the bands have
since taken to the streets, where they have also had to sleep in
order to guard their instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Dawad Philip, a manager for Pan Rebels, one of the bands, said
portable toilets had been installed on the block, and the band
members were coping with the situation. ``Life goes on,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the alcohol ban, myriad other safety-related
changes that will probably be less visible to spectators were
ordered by the city. Giuliani ordered some of the changes after two
11-year-olds and an 18-year-old man were killed at the parade last
year. The children were hit by a supply van that lurched out of
control and pinned them against a sound truck. The man was killed
hours later, when he backed away from a snake held by a spectator
and was crushed by the another sound truck after a piece of his
clothing got caught in its wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Parade organizers and city officials agreed to a number of
provisions to improve safety. Floats are supposed to be modified to
give drivers better visibility, and police officers will be
assigned to cars and sound trucks to control spacing between the
floats. Everything on wheels will require authorization.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on: Wheel covers are required for trucks and
floats, animals like snakes that might frighten spectators will not
be permitted and the number of vendors will be restricted to
curtail overcrowding. Spectators will be asked not to dance
randomly in the streets or to board floats that are in motion.
</P>
<P>
   Chief of Department Joseph J. Esposito said that the police
detail would be ``adequately increased because there are more
things to do now,'' but declined to give specific figures.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders said that while the ban on alcohol would not
dampen the fun of the parade, which runs along Eastern Parkway from
Utica Avenue to Grand Army Plaza, it did make the economics of the
event trickier. ``This carnival brings in resources to the city of
New York,'' said Una Clarke, a councilwoman from Brooklyn. ``So it
needs more government support, which should subsidize part of the
expense so band leaders and costume makers would be able to get the
material they need and not spend September doing parties that
include the sale of alcohol. And the fact is they have sponsors who
also sell alcohol that want to know that there is a return on their
investment in promoting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke stopped short of criticizing City Hall. ``I am an elected
leader in the community and have to display accountability,'' she
said. ``I don't have to hit the mayor over his head for everything
that is done.''

   Possession is a strange thing. It begins in childhood. If you
ask children anywhere, in any part of the world, they can
immediately identify the object they cherish most.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers commissioned by The New York Times asked children
to pose with their most prized possessions. If these pictures say
anything at all, it is that most children prefer at least two
points of contact with their beloved object _ that is, two hands,
or a hand and a face. The children do not just point. They encircle
their objects. They hold their dolls, their soccer balls and their
animals _ stuffed or live _ close to their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   You have to look twice to see that Elif, an 8-year-old in Agni,
Turkey, is not holding a real baby.
</P>
<P>
   And heaven help anyone who tries to pry the soccer ball from the
mittened hands of Gennady, in Novokuznetsk, Siberia, or the stuffed
horse from the arms of Ally, an 8-year old in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the wealthier have the fanciest toys.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher, a 12-year-old in suburban Maryland, got a new red
kayak.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who have next to nothing, though, manage to locate
and claim something in the world that they love best.
</P>
<P>
   Two 10-year-old boys in Istanbul, Emre and Yunus, found their
favorite possession abandoned in their neighborhood _ a rusted car
that they pretend to race.

<P>
   NUCLEAR-SECRETS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The case of Dr. Wen Ho Lee
raises a troubling question: what's really secret anymore? The
surprising answer is a lot. Some restricted data is deemed so
sensitive that Washington is engaged in a quiet effort to raise
classifications from secret to top secret for 65 nuclear topics,
making whole libraries of sequestered data less likely to slip into
foreign hands. By William J. Broad. (Moved in `a' category)

   MOSQUITOES-GLOBALIZATION-REVIEW (Paris) _ Mosquitoes and efforts
to control them are at the nexus between the poor, infected world
and the rich, scared one. A look at how globalization has
intensified the spread of mosquitoes, exposing rich countries to
the same hazards as poor lands. By Donald G. McNeil. (Moved in `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   POLS-MENTAL-HEALTH-REVIEW (Washington) _ New disclosures of
President Richard M. Nixon's purported drug abuse and mental health
problems raise important questions. While the physical health of
presidents and politicians has become a fit topic for public
discussion, the majority still hide their mental difficulties. Vast
increases in the willingness of ordinary Americans willing to seek
mental health help and talk about it have not been reflected in the
political class. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   UNIONS-INCOME-REVIEW (Undated) _ For the nation's labor
movement, Public Enemy No. 1 has long been the nation's growing
income gap. But as the presidential campaign has heated up, labor
leaders have begun speaking out less than usual about the income
gap partly because focusing on it might embarrass Vice President Al
Gore, since the gap continued to widen under the Clinton
administration. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   CHEERLEADING-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ After years of disregard
and even ridicule, cheerleading is back, bigger than ever _ and
with a sassy, teeth-baring attitude that's a long way from
old-fashioned pom-pom waving. Excerpts from recent issues of
American Cheerleader magazine suggest some of the forces at play in
the brave new world of cheerleader empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   ABBIE-HOFFMAN-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The late radical activist
Abbie Hoffman is the subject of a new film ``Steal This Movie,''
which may enlighten young Americans who know some '60s music but
regard his life and times as remote from their own dot-com lives.
Throughout his life, Hoffman wrote letters to his brother, Jack,
who ran the family business in Worcester, Mass. Some excerpts from
the letters provide rare insight into Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-RELIGION-REVIEW (Atlanta) _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman's
emphasis on America's need for religious values in public life has
made him popular with the Christian right and raised some concern
among many with more moderate religious views. But Christian
conservatives believe they have a mission to spread the gospel of
Jesus to non-believers, while Lieberman, as a Jew without a
sectarian mandate to proselytize, bears none of the baggage of the
religious salesman, and is thus more palatable to a wider public.
By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIDRUG-PROGRAMS-REVIEW (Undated) _ When Colombian President
Andres Pastrana said the key to winning the war on drugs was taming
demand in the United States, he ruffled some American feathers, in
part because he took no account of the myriad demand-reduction
programs already in place. A look at some of those efforts. By Alan
Feuer.
</P>
<P>
   KIDS-BELONGINGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ If asked, children in any
part of the world can immediately identify the personal belonging
they cherish most. In this photo essay, kids from around the world
pose with their most prized possessions.
</P>
<P>
   TEN-USOPEN-APPAREL-REVIEW (New York) _ The death of tennis
whites: a look at how competitors at the U.S. Open have turned to
playing in more colorful and fashionable attire. By Liz Robbins.

   SUBMARINES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Kursk disaster has cast a
harsher light on the secrecy that continues to define submarine
operations. It has also raised the question of whether a little
less cloak and dagger _ and more cooperation among seafaring
nations _ could go a long way toward improving the safety of those
on board the vessels. By Christopher Drew.

NEW YORK'S MIGHTY RIVER IS BECOMING SWIMMER-FRIENDLY 
</HEADLINE>
  By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So much sewage once floated in the Hudson River that Shabazz
Jackson and his friends made up their own version of the breast
stroke when they swam along the shore in Beacon, N.Y., in the
1950s. They would jump in feet first, then flail their arms to push
the stinking mess away from their faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all swam in the Hudson,'' Jackson, 50, an environmental
engineer who still lives in Beacon, said Thursday. ``It was an open
sewer, but it was still the mighty river. You'd just swim with your
head out of the water and push the debris away with your arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Jackson still jumps into the river, but he is more likely
to bump into other swimmers than into raw sewage.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly thirty years of cleanup efforts, the Hudson River
has rebounded from a dumping ground for human and industrial waste
to one of the state's leading recreational sites. Now there is even
officially sanctioned swimming in its murky waters, from organized
races around Manhattan to a handful of public beaches in
Westchester and Ulster Counties.
</P>
<P>
   With the unofficial end of summer this Labor Day weekend,
hundreds of swimmers stroked their way into the Hudson River for
the first time. And if New York state officials have their way,
even more will have the opportunity to do so over the next few
years. The Department of Environmental Conservation and the Office
of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, want to create a
string of state-operated beaches along its shores from the northern
tip of Manhattan to Columbia County, just south of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Hudson is not for everyone. Daniel L. Thomason, 28, a
financial consultant from Manhattan who was visiting friends,
steadfastly refused to leave his beach chair. ``I would need a lot
more convincing, let's put it that way,'' said Thomason, ignoring
the beckoning wave of one friend. ``The Hudson may be cleaner now,
but it smells and looks nasty. I wouldn't even let my dog swim in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   While the very notion can still wrinkle noses, people have
dipped into the Hudson as long as anyone can remember. Open-bottom
barges anchored in the Hudson and East Rivers, known as ``floating
swimming pools,'' were used by city dwellers for bathing at the
turn of the century. And swimming areas once dotted the river's
banks, including ``Cole's Grove,'' a dock and pavilions at the
Catskills home of Thomas Cole, the founder of the Hudson River
School of painters.
</P>
<P>
   There were health risks in earlier years, of course, from
exposure to the raw sewage, garbage and chemicals routinely dumped
into the river by industries along its shores. But the 1972 Clean
Water Act, which required that sewage be treated before being
released in the river, and later pollution controls cleaned up the
river and made much of it fit for swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who shunned the Hudson in the bad days have plunged
right in. Gov. George Pataki dives into the river a half-dozen
times a year from a sailboat that he keeps in Verplanck. ``When I
was a kid, you wouldn't even stick your toe in the Hudson River,''
Pataki said in a telephone interview. ``It was so polluted your
parents and everybody made it plain that you risked life and limb
by setting foot in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Knaust, 35, a Saugerties resident, took her two young
daughters to swim at the beach at Ulster Landing Park on a recent
sweltering afternoon. ``I think it's clean and safe for swimming,''
she said. ``We're normal people. We don't have seven toes, we don't
have a third eye, and we've been swimming in the Hudson our whole
lives.''

ON PRO FOOTBALL: AN ENERGETIC COWHER LAYS FOUNDATION TO REBUILD THE
STEELERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Steelers have already moved their offices into a
$10 million complex renovated from an old mill. A year from now,
the Steelers will leave their game-day home of the last 31 years,
rusty Three Rivers Stadium, and play in a glistening new $260
million stadium in downtown Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Now to renovate and remodel the team.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Steelers are rebuilding, and the notion has been
hard for all involved to accept. But they are what they are _ a
team that has crawled to 7-9 and 6-10 records in the last two
seasons, missing the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cowher, the Steelers' coach, survived the gutting process.
He went to the Steelers' owner, Dan Rooney, after last season _ one
full of trying times and a 1-7 finish _ and told Rooney he was
willing to step down if he was the problem. Rooney said no. But
Cowher's relationship with Tom Donahue, the team's former personnel
chief, had soured. One had to go. It was Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   Cowher watched last season and this preseason as Kordell Stewart
kept slipping and suffering at quarterback. A move was required.
When Pittsburgh opens the season at home Sunday against the
Baltimore Ravens, Kent Graham starts as the new quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   So, for now, no more Donahue or Stewart migraines for Cowher.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the coach has a new pep in his voice and in his walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we're reshaping ourselves, and I have a renewed energy
about that,'' Cowher said. ``We've got a good blend going, and
we're trying to strike gold again. When you sit back and reflect,
it's been hard. We've been through some tough times in the last two
years. We're moving past that.''
</P>
<P>
   If you coach in the NFL for as long as Cowher has, stuff
happens. Weird stuff. This is his ninth season in Pittsburgh and,
along with Minnesota's Dennis Green, he is currently the most
tenured coach with one team in the league. For Cowher, 43, for all
longtime coaches, the cycle of winning and losing is consuming,
engulfing. And, often, somehow, the valleys swallow the peaks.
</P>
<P>
   For Cowher, it seems like yesterday that he was 34, having been
a defensive coach in Cleveland and Kansas City for seven years and
a linebacker with the Browns and Eagles for five years before that.
It was when Cowher was 34, in 1992, that Rooney turned to him for
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Cowher start as Pittsburgh coach? An 11-5 record
and a divisional championship in his first season. And then his
Steelers went 9-7, 12-4 and 11-5, winning two more divisional
titles and earning a Super Bowl berth. He was 38 when he coached
the team that lost to Dallas in Super Bowl XXX, and that made him
the youngest head coach ever in a Super Bowl. That was followed
with two more winning seasons and two more playoff teams. This was
nice. Cowher was making winning look so easy. He was intense on the
sideline, prepared before and during games and his players
responded to his emotional brand of coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Now he leads a cast that has lost six consecutive divisional
games and one that went 2-6 at home last season.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is overcoming two seasons where his players and coaches
said he was a brooding Bill, a less-excited coach, one that
appeared frazzled and sapped.
</P>
<P>
   Cowher said of Donahue: ``It didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney said: ``We had conversations in December and January
after the season, and it was obvious that some relationships in
this organization had become strained, and that it was not a
comfortable situation for anyone. It was obvious that the way it
was going was not going to work. Basically, my job is to do what is
best for this team. I think the way we went was and is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say Bill is more relaxed this year, more energized
and positive. He wants to develop our young players. We are being
realistic _ we are not running around here saying we'll be in the
Super Bowl. We are building and improving, and that is something
that goes against the grain for us because our object is to win. We
approach things in ways that a lot of people think is antiquated,
but we believe in drafting and developing our players and making
decisions in free agency that really count.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made mistakes. I, for one, for example, did not want to
lose Rod Woodson a couple of years ago, and we probably shouldn't
have. But right now we are approaching things as a team in
management and coaching, in unison, and we go from here.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cowher, that means juggling his quarterbacks. He will give
Graham the chance to lead, but chances are Stewart will emerge at
quarterback sometime during the season because Graham, throughout
his career, has not been able to maintain the starting job.
Cowher's offensive line needs more manpower. His defensive line,
too. And his receivers are talented _ especially the rookie Plaxico
Burress _ but awfully young and very hesitant, showing a reluctance
to go after the football and swipe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players felt like Bill would be back this year,'' said the
running back Jerome Bettis. ``When you have two straight losing
seasons, there is a feeling of desperation. But we've lost players
and have not been able to keep talented guys and the coach can only
work with what he's got. Bill wears his heart on his sleeve and
what you see is what you get. He's straitlaced. He's a motivator.
Some people think some of his actions on the sideline are staged,
but he's just into the game and his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's toughened up now. He used to have a veteran team and
allowed guys to lead and gave them room. Now he has a lot of young
players and I see him going back to his early days of establishing
order. And guys like that because he is straight and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The season could be lost for Pittsburgh just about the time it
starts. The Steelers play eight of their first nine games against
divisional opponents and have recently struggled mightily in the
AFC Central, even losing last year at home to the expansion
Cleveland Browns. But as long as the Steelers simply show progress,
Cowher, a Pittsburgh native, will be around for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a young team and I'm communicating more and trying to
make them feel what it really means to be a Steeler and the joy of
winning,'' Cowher said. ``I am thrilled about the new complex and
the new stadium because, with that built-in excitement, it just
makes everything easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowher knows he cannot go back to old glory.
</P>
<P>
   But at least he has a shot to create it anew.

TURNAROUNDS IN TEXAS: TWO TEAMS TAKE TUMBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A certain Texas officeholder who is a candidate for office
elsewhere has to hope that he will fare better in his race than the
state's two major league baseball teams have this year in theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers and the Houston Astros have had remarkably
similar experiences. Winners of three division championships in the
past four years but not advancing beyond the first round of the
playoffs in any of those years, the Rangers and the Astros both
lost key players, voluntarily or involuntarily, last winter and
both have spent most of the season in last place.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few bright spots for each team has been a player who
has broken the franchise's record for hitting in consecutive games.
But their season will not be remembered for the feats of Gabe
Kapler and Tony Eusebio. The season will be remembered for the
great plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have something to do with the drought we're having in
Texas,'' Gerry Hunsicker, the Astros' general manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's been a rough year in Texas,'' said Doug Melvin, the
Rangers' general manager, referring to baseball, not weather.
``Things just didn't go as planned. I think with both of us it was
the cost of having success, the cost of winning divisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers last year had the second highest payroll; only the
New York Yankees paid their players more. They began this season as
No. 9, having lowered their payroll from $81.6 million to $70.8
million. The Astros ended last season 11th in payroll ($55 million)
and began this season 19th ($51 million).
</P>
<P>
   During the winter, the Rangers traded Juan Gonzalez and lost,
not all willingly, Todd Zeile, Aaron Sele, Mark McLemore and Tom
Goodwin as free agents. The Astros traded Mike Hampton, Carl
Everett and Derek Bell and let Ricky Gutierrez leave as a free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning once you can get by,'' Melvin said, speaking of the
economics of success. ``We won three of four; they won three in a
row. Your payroll goes sky high. The salaries continue to
escalate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker acknowledged that the Astros made moves partly for
economic reasons. They also wanted to make room for some younger
players they thought were ready, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the economic part, he said: ``We have a budget and we
have to live within our means, even moving into a new stadium. A
player like Rickey Gutierrez was probably missed more than we
anticipated. He's a player we undervalued.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't strengthen ourselves with the moves we made during
the winter,'' he added. ``But I expected the team to contend in our
division. A lot of people point to the off-season moves as the
beginning of our demise. I don't share those opinions. I think the
lineup we put on the field had the potential to be a good as the
'98 team, which was the best offensively in the history of the
franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' pitching, Hunsicker said, was a question mark going
in. But, he said: ``It's been a question mark for this franchise
every year. But every year we've had people rise to the occasion
and perform above expectations. More and more I think that's what
has to happen for clubs to win. Pitching has to exceed
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   No one expected the Astros' pitchers to suffer the major shock
that accompanied the move from the Astrodome to Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the new park has had a greater effect on our club than
anticipated,'' Hunsicker said. ``No club can win without a
home-field advantage. In the first half it wasn't an advantage for
us. We've played much better since then at home. Pitchers are
adapting more to the ballpark, realizing that it is realistic to
pitch well in this park. You just don't have the margin for error
you have in other parks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have gone from having one of the most efficient
pitching staffs in the league (3.83 earned run average) to having
the least efficient (5.33) and from allowing the fewest home runs
(128) to being among the leaders in giving up the most (184). The
pitchers haven't been helped by the defense, which has already
committed more errors (110) than last season (106).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our record would be better if we hadn't made any moves in the
off-season,'' Hunsicker said, ``but I would be hard pressed to
think we'd be in first place or close to first given the breakdowns
we've had in key areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers ended last season with eight players who could be
free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to be older and more expensive,'' Melvin said.
``For us to keep the players that helped us win the past two years
we probably would have had a $95 million payroll with players on
long-term contracts. We would have had to stay at 95 for a good two
or three years. That's why we felt we had to make some moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading Gonzalez was the biggest decision the Rangers had to
make, but failing to sign Zeile and Sele, the free agents they
wanted to retain, hurt the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sele kept turning me down on $28 million,'' Melvin said,
referring to his four-year offer to the pitcher who subsequently
signed with Seattle for two years and $15 million. ``I wasn't
aggressive on Zeile early on. I didn't go to a third year until the
last minute.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the absent players, Melvin said: ``We have not
been nearly as good as a team. We took some risks and ended up
relying on a lot of ifs. In the past we had been a solid veteran
team. We knew what players were going to do for us. This year we
went a lot based on potential. It didn't happen. Then we had
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, in comparing these developments, said: ``Last year we
won 95 games, had the best year in franchise history and lost $10
to $12 million. This year we have a chance to have the worst record
in a long time, and they tell me we can break even.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Milestones Are in Reach
</P>
<P>
   Can Darin Erstad break George Sisler's major league record for
hits? Can Todd Helton become the first player to hit .400 since Ted
Williams in 1941? Can Carlos Delgado become the first Triple Crown
winner since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967?
</P>
<P>
   Seldom has there been a season in which three such sterling
offensive achievements were within reach in the final four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad: The Anaheim hit man took 204 hits into the Angels game
last night. With 28 games remaining, he would basically have to
average 1.893 hits a game to tie Sisler's record of 257 in 1920,
1.929 to break it. Given the difficulty of registering such
averages, Erstad would settle for two hits a game.
</P>
<P>
   Helton: He was hitting .393 before Saturday's game in Colorado.
If, in the Rockies' final 28 games, he averaged 3.62 at-bats a
game, his average for his first 132 games this season, he would
have to get 44 hits to finish at .40069, or .401. Forty-three hits
would take him only to .399 (.39896).
</P>
<P>
   Delgado: Entering Saturday's schedule, the Toronto first baseman
was second in the American League in hitting at .365, second in
runs batted in with 124 and tied for first in home runs with 39.
Nomar Garciaparra of Boston was ahead of him in average at .369,
and Erstad was right behind at .364. He was three RBI behind Edgar
Martinez of Seattle and just ahead of Mike Sweeney of Kansas City
(123) and Frank Thomas of Chicago (122). He was tied in home runs
with Thomas and Troy Glaus of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   One-Hit Wonders
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez, as usual, was so overwhelming in his start
against Tampa Bay last Tuesday that his one-hit performance (John
Flaherty's leadoff single in the ninth inning) overshadowed
performances in other games that night. The Devil Rays were not the
only team to get only one hit that night. They were, in fact, only
one of three teams that got only one hit that night.
</P>
<P>
   A one-out single by Barry Bonds in the first inning was the only
hit San Francisco managed against Pittsburgh (Kris Benson eight
innings, Josias Manzanillo one inning). James Mouton's two-run home
run in the sixth inning was the lone Milwaukee hit against Los
Angeles (Chan Ho Park eight, Mike Fetters one).
</P>
<P>
   The last time one day's schedule produced three games in which
teams got no more than one hit, according to the Elias Sports
Bureau, was Sept. 24, 1988. Cleveland had one hit against Dave
Stieb of Toronto, Texas one hit against Mark Langston of Seattle
and Philadelphia no hits against Pascual Perez of Montreal in a
rain-shortened five-inning game.
</P>
<P>
   Making an Appointment?
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Richman, the senior adviser in the Yankees' media
relations department, has a special interest in the outcome of the
presidential contest between George W. Bush, former managing
partner of the Texas Rangers, and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Richman said he told Bush five years ago that he would someday
be president of the United States. After asking him what he was
smoking, Richman, a friend of the Bush family, said that Bush told
him, ``If I become president, I'm going to appoint you my good-will
ambassador to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Richman has his passport ready.  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As other key members of the U.S. men's Olympic team
have taken unplanned early leaves from the U.S. Open, Todd Martin
remains in play at Flushing Meadows. While Andre Agassi, Michael
Chang and Jeff Tarango all have time to reflect, attend to family
business or sleep before making the long trip to Australia on Sept.
13, Martin is only thinking about his third-round match Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He is thrilled to be playing singles on the six-member team,
especially after losing his spot on the 1996 squad when his ranking
slipped in one bad week before the team was announced. Anticipation
has replaced that distant disappointment, but Martin is not
focusing on the past or the future now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that is very big and a very great occasion. But
so is this,'' Martin said, referring to the Open. ``It's pretty
easy to keep them straight.''
</P>
<P>
   If he were to advance to the finals of the Open next Sunday,
however, his itinerary would become numbing. He would have to fly
cross-country Monday to California, go through processing the next
day and then make the trip to Australia, where the Olympic tennis
tournament begins Sept. 19. Cross that dateline when he gets to it,
Martin figures.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the other players on the U.S. men's and women's
teams are already shifting their focus to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   After Martin eliminated Chang in their second-round match Friday
afternoon, Chang spoke about how winning a medal would redeem his
frustrating season. While the 28-year-old rebounded from a far
worse year by winning a tournament in Los Angeles last July,
bringing his ranking up to 24, he has not advanced past a Grand
Slam third round this year. ``From here on out, it's the biggest
event left for me,'' Chang said of the Sydney Games. ``I don't see
myself playing the Olympics in 2004. This is my one opportunity to
be able to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang is the only member of the men's team who played at the
1992 Games in Barcelona, Spain, and yet, remarkably, he is still
the youngest member of the squad for Sydney. Agassi, the defending
gold medalist, is 30. So is Martin. The 31-year-old Jeff Tarango
eagerly accepted his bid when Jan-Michael Gambill declined the
Olympic invitation, as had Pete Sampras. The doubles team of Jared
Palmer, 30, and Alex O'Brien, 29, is ranked No. 3 in the world and
has a strong chance of winning a medal.
</P>
<P>
   The women's Olympic team has only five members, without a
separate pair for doubles, because the Women's Tennis Association
did not vote to make the Olympics count for point standings, as did
the men. This is where the controversy began when women's coach,
Billie Jean King, chose Serena Williams, a higher-ranked singles
player, over Lisa Raymond, the top doubles player in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess she's got her Dream Team, now,'' Raymond said last
week, still bitter over the snub.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Raymond _ Williams is pairing with her sister Venus
in the Olympic doubles _ the U.S. women's team could sweep the
medals. The defending gold medalist, Lindsay Davenport, leads the
squad, with her 1996 teammate Monica Seles and Venus Williams as
the three U.S. entries in the 64-player singles tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis was reintroduced as an Olympic sport only in 1988, after
a 64-year absence. Since then, U.S. women have done better than the
men, winning five gold medals. (Jennifer Capriati won singles in
1992 and the doubles team of Mary Joe Fernandez and Gigi Fernandez
completed the gold sweep in 1996.) The men, conversely, have won
just two gold medals since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the top men's players, like Gustavo Kuerten,
Magnus Norman, Patrick Rafter and Yevgeny Kafelnikov plan on
playing in Sydney, some of the top-ranked women will not compete in
the Olympics. Switzerland's Martina Hingis, the No. 1 player in the
world, and Russia's Anna Kournikova will not be there. Mary Pierce,
who plays for France in Federation Cup, lives full time in the
United States, so she was ineligible to play for France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the women's game, some of the top players that are
not playing probably don't have a strong allegiance to their
country,'' Davenport said. ``In that case, that kind of spoils the
whole Olympic spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, who ignited her career by winning the gold medal in
1996, grew up with that spirit. Her father, Wink, played volleyball
at the Mexico City Olympics in 1968, and both of her parents worked
at the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles, where the family lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go to the Olympics was so exciting,'' Davenport said, ``to
meet the other athletes, see the other aspects, and not just have
the I've-got-to-win-every-match kind of attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women plan to stay in the athletes' village, for some
team bonding; the men's squad will stay in a hotel, which is just
fine with Chang. In Barcelona in 1992, the athletes' dorms had no
air-conditioning and Chang said he sweated so much he could barely
sleep. Then he got food poisoning in the athletes' cafeteria right
before his second-round match and he was eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to the Olympics, I am,'' said Chang, whose
victory in the 1989 French Open remains his one major triumph. ``I
think it's going to be a good experience. I think at this point in
my career, I think it would rank probably one step below the French
Open.''

CARTER FINDS IT TOUGH GOING IN 2 DIRECTIONS AT ONCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHAINA, Hawaii _ Vince Carter, showman, All-Star and now
Olympian, has become basketball's biggest wishbone. The purists and
the icons are tugging one leg, telling him he needs to be a more
complete player. The National Basketball Association and its
highlight-obsessed fans pull hard on the other, shouting: ``Dunk!
dunk!''
</P>
<P>
   Those conflicting signals are enough to make a 23-year-old
dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   This is the part of Vinsanity they don't show on Sportscenter.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter's mother, Michelle Carter-Robinson, arises at 4:30
a.m., here on Thursday morning. While her son sleeps, she conducts
the daily business of selling ``Vince Carter,'' on the East Coast,
where it is 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want him to concentrate on basketball,'' she said.
``The way things have been going lately, I could tell that wasn't
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a reported $30 million shoe deal with Nike, a contract
that would pay off his legal debt for attempting to pull out of his
contract with Puma and put Carter on new, stratospheric endorsement
ground. Not true, Carter says, but he wishes it were.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the quick and painful end to last season, when
Carter's Toronto Raptors were swept in the first round by the
Knicks. His coach, Butch Carter, kept talking and talking and
eventually was fired. Tracy McGrady, his closest friend and
teammate, left for Orlando to play with Grant Hill. McGrady took
not-so-subtle shots at Carter after his departure.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, there were those comments from Michael Jordan earlier
this summer, aimed at drawing a clear distinction between Carter
and Kobe Bryant, the league's other most scintillating young
player.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Jordan said that Kobe is more sound and a better
all-around player than Vince.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of makes you want to throw up your hands and say,
`Make up your mind,''' Carter said. ``I do get mixed messages. I
hear everything, but I just try to go about my life. If I sit here
and worry about all that, man, I could go down the tubes in a
hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The dunking is a part of the game. ,'' he added. ``Sometimes,
I watch ESPN or read in the paper, `Oh, Vince didn't get a dunk
tonight.' So what? The dunk didn't make me famous. I earned the
honor of being selected to the All-Star Game. I think that's major.
The dunk is flash. That's what people want to see. But that didn't
make me famous. I think I earned respect from players. `Vince put
up some numbers.' Of course, I won the hearts of a lot of young
people because of the flash. But that flash is not going to be
there my whole career. I can tell you that now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, I guess I asked for this. I love to put on a
show. But I also know the league can't give me a championship. I
have to go earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter also understands that as long as his team loses in the
playoffs and players like Bryant advance, detractors will wonder if
he is more style than substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe's a good player,'' Carter said. ``He has a ring. I don't.
But the comparisons? That kind of stuff doesn't get me down or
bother me. I'm still going to play. I'm still going to do what I
have to do to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Michelle Carter-Robinson:, ``Michael Jordan is entitled to
his opinion just like I am entitled to mine. Now I have my opinion
why Michael Jordan made so public his negative evaluation of
Vince's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day when I meet Michael face to face, believe me, I would
like to discuss that with him. If you think Kobe Bryant is a better
player, wonderful. There are others who think Vince Carter is a
better player. And who is better doesn't really make any
difference. Kobe is a fantastic player. Vince is a fantastic
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, there have been a lot of `nexts' out there. Stackhouse.
Penny. Grant Hill. The list goes on and on. Possibly, Vince has
threatened the idea of having a real `next' more than anyone else.
Possibly. I'll just leave it that.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael needs to keep Vince down, if for no other reason than
his legacy may someday be challenged by another North Carolina
skywalker who left school after his junior year.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit of a maternal reach, but perhaps not that removed.
Like Jordan, Michelle Robinson's Carter's son can't help but stand
out.
</P>
<P>
   Carter grew his hair this summer. For the moment, gone is the
pronounced dome that distinguished him almost as much as Mark
Messier's forehead distinguished the hockey icon. A late selection
to the Olympic team, Carter also has tried to quietly fit in with
his teammates _ many of whom wondered if his stardom might obscure
their own.
</P>
<P>
   For five days of training camp, he melted into the background
while Kevin Garnett, Gary Payton and Tim Hardaway whooped, hollered
and had a grand time scrimmaging. But the spotlight shone down
Thursday night, in Team USA's first exhibition against Canada. The
best aerial show in North America could no longer stay grounded.
</P>
<P>
   In a 99-70 victory at the University of Hawaii, Carter scored 29
points in 19 minutes. His signature field goal came with about 7
minutes left in the game. Jason Kidd flicked an alley-oop toward
the right side of the rim as Carter rose and elevated behind the
Canadian front line.
</P>
<P>
   He grabbed the ball at its apex with two hands and dunked along
the baseline, bringing more than 7,000 people to their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Air Canada, at cruising altitude, en route to Sydney.

probably sounded like a Baptist preacher when I told him `With God
on your side, what man should you fear?' But oh well. Mostly, I
wanted to get across `You play basketball.' And, of course, the
most important thing that I told him was, `Mommy loves you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince wants to please the NBA, but I think he wants to please
his Mom just a little bit more,'' Carter-Robinson said. ``It's more
important to me that I like my son after basketball is over.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: IN SEARCH OF WINNING ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Sept. 3:
</P>
<P>
   By tradition an intense new phase of the presidential campaign
starts this weekend. Since experience suggests that whoever is
ahead in the polls after Labor Day usually wins the race in
November, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are
scrambling hard to gain traction on defining issues _ fiscal
responsibility, health care and retirement security for Gore, and
schools, tax cuts and defense for Bush. But a new measure of the
Texas governor's troubles in the last two weeks came with his
decision to launch a tough television ad with a personal attack on
Gore's integrity. Suddenly a tone of alarm could be detected in a
once-confident Republican campaign that had promised to remain
positive.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, Bush's campaign was bound to remind voters of
what Gore himself has called an embarrassment, his visit to a
Buddhist temple in California where campaign donors were in
attendance. The vice president's implausible denials that he was
aware that this was a fund-raising event are, of course, fair game
as an issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is right to remind Americans that he favors campaign
finance reform and Bush does not. There may be no similarly awkward
pictures of the governor meeting with donors, but Bush has been a
prodigious fund-raiser from special interests this year and his
Republican allies in Congress are the ones who blocked the
soft-money ban that would do much to clean up the system.
</P>
<P>
   The new ad reflects an underlying reality of the campaign: that
on most issues of concern to voters, the polls show Gore at an
advantage, whereas until the conventions most voters seemed to like
Bush better as a leader. For months Gore found it hard to make
headway in the polls, despite broad popular support for using the
surplus to pay for school aid, limited tax cuts and a prescription
drug program in Medicare. In the last two weeks Bush has not had
much success in rallying support for his more sweeping tax cut.
Despite his 100th appearance in a school in this campaign, he is
not especially favored on education either.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign may have felt it had little choice but to return
to the two issues that have worked before _ defense, where
Republicans hold a distinct advantage according to most polls, and
the issue of trustworthiness as a leader. Indeed, tacticians in
both camps have long assumed that Bush would have to link Gore to
the ethical lapses of the Clinton administration at some point in
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the Republican ad depicting Gore as a
politician who would say anything to win appeared only a day after
Bush promised not to engage in personal attacks. It undercut the
one advantage the governor has enjoyed thus far: voters' perception
of him as a likable, confident and straight-talking leader. Since
polls show that voters overwhelmingly hate so-called negative ads,
it is now possible that voters will focus on the Bush tactic, and
think less of him for it, than on the point the ad is making. A
similar problem arose with Gore a couple of months ago when he
started attacking Bush on issues and then had to defend himself
against criticism that he was going negative.
</P>
<P>
   In political terms, it is hard to tell how voters will react to
Bush's decision to have his running mate, former Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney, attack Gore for alleged declines in military
readiness. Though many voters trust Republicans on this issue, the
polls also show that they do not seem to be terribly concerned
about it this year. Their attention may also be called to the
uncertain tone of the criticism. While Bush and Cheney want greater
readiness, they also say they want less involvement by U.S. troops
in peacekeeping in Europe and elsewhere. Such a position runs
counter to Bush's pledge for the United States not to shrink from
its global responsibilities. William Kristol, the acerbic editor of
The Weekly Standard, last week called such talk from Republicans of
reduced involvement more reminiscent of George McGovern than Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   A final note of defensiveness by the Bush campaign was sounded
on the issue of debates. Bush says he wants to participate, but his
negotiators are pressing for debates to be broadcast on one network
only. That demand would not serve the public. With issues mattering
more and more, the best way for them to be addressed would be in
debates on prime time with all networks showing them. The Gore and
Bush campaigns should get down to the business of agreeing on times
and dates without delay. &QL;

HAROLD BOWEN, 87, ADMIRAL WHO LED INQUIRY OF PUEBLO INCIDENT

 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice Admiral Harold G. Bowen Jr., who presided over the Navy's
investigation into one of the most wrenching episodes in its
history _ the seizure of the electronic surveillance ship Pueblo by
North Korea _ died on Aug. 17 at his home in Alexandria, Va. He was
87.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an admiral, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and
a combat veteran of two wars, Bowen was steeped in Navy traditions,
foremost among them: ``Don't give up the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding Capt. James Lawrence's time-honored rallying cry
in the War of 1812, the Pueblo was given up by its skipper, Cmdr.
Lloyd M. Bucher, without firing a shot when it came under attack on
Jan. 23, 1968, off the North Korean coast.
</P>
<P>
   While operating in international waters and, according to the
U.S. government, monitoring coastal radar stations and submarine
movements, the Pueblo was fired upon by North Korean boats. With
only two machine guns for defense, 10 crewmen wounded and one
killed, Bucher allowed his ship to be boarded and taken to the port
of Wonsan.
</P>
<P>
   The 82 surviving crewmen were taken captive and classified
documents were seized despite a frantic effort by the Pueblo's crew
to destroy all secret materials. The crewmen were held for 11
months, subjected to beatings, then released when a U.S. general in
Korea, acting on behalf of the Pentagon, signed a confession, which
he at the same time repudiated, stating that the Pueblo had been
spying inside North Korean territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen was president of a naval court of inquiry that held two
months of hearings on the Pueblo affair in Coronado, Calif., in the
winter of 1969. The panel of five admirals heard testimony from 104
witnesses, including Bucher, who maintained ``we did not have the
power to resist'' and said he had surrendered the ship to save the
lives of his crew.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowen panel recommended unanimously that Bucher undergo a
general court-martial _ the most serious form of military trial _
to face charges arising from the loss of his ship and classified
documents. It also recommended disciplinary action against two
other officers on the Pueblo and two officers in the Navy's Pacific
command.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1969, Navy Secretary John H. Chafee ruled that no one
would be punished. He said that the Pueblo officers ``have suffered
enough'' and that the inability to anticipate the attack reflected
a general failure in the Navy command.
</P>
<P>
   When he presided over the inquiry, Harold Gardiner Bowen Jr. was
commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's Anti-submarine Warfare Force,
having spent more than three decades in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Annapolis, Md., graduated from the Naval Academy
in 1933, fourth in his class, and received a master's degree in
metallurgical engineering in 1942 from the Carnegie Institute of
Technology. He served as a gunnery officer on a cruiser and
commander of a destroyer in the South Pacific during World War II,
then commanded a destroyer division in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen was deputy chief of naval operations for research and
development from 1965 to 1967, when he was promoted to vice
admiral. He received the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of
Merit and the Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen retired from the Navy in 1972, then served as president of
an intelligence analysis company and as an industrial consultant in
electrical wire and cable technology.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by three daughters, Constance Bowen-Camp, of
Mountain View, Calif., Kathryn Wilder, of Soquel, Calif., and
Charlotte Phelps, of Denver; and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after the court of inquiry made its
recommendations, Bowen reflected on the Pueblo case from his
headquarters in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``That man could have been the greatest hero in the U.S. Navy,''
Bowen said of Bucher. ``But he let government property get away.
When the captain fails, the system fails. It opens up seams all the
way to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a commanding officer to do anything other than guard his
ship with his life is indefensible. I'll admit it takes guts;
that's what you gotta have. The thought of saving his crew is
interesting, humane, but it had nothing at all to do with the job
he was assigned to do. Tradition? Yes. The reason it's tradition is
that most people have done it.''

<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Lebanon is slipping toward a constitutional
crisis _ and a tough early test for Syria's new young leader,
Bashar Assad _ as it goes into a final round of parliamentary
elections on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rafik Hariri, the flamboyant multibillionaire real estate
developer, appears poised to roll up a majority in the 128-seat
Parliament, probably 70 seats or more, in his effort to come back
as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   But President Emile Lahoud, annointed by Syria, which for a
decade has been the only real political power here, appears
determined, somehow, to block Hariri from regaining the office he
held from 1992 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri threw up showy projects, including rebuilding the
downtown devastated by the 15-year civil war, but Lahoud has
accused him of plunging the country into debt and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The government took a terrific blow in the first round of
elections last Sunday in the far north, the Christian heartland,
and the Druz mountains, with final tallies showing 41 of the 63
seats going to government critics or candidates allied with Hariri.
Riding a wave of economic discontent, the tycoon has built an
imposing set of alliances for the vote Sunday in Beirut, the south
and the Bekaa region.
</P>
<P>
   Winding up with a series of packed, emotional street rallies,
Hariri exuded confidence Saturday morning in his huge, ornate
palace, as aides and candidates on his ticket scurried about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polls are good,'' he said. ``Tomorrow we will see if they
are right. The battle is for Beirut.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Lahoud's main political ally, Michel Murr, the
powerful interior minister, says no matter how many votes and how
much parliamentary support Hariri gets, he is not coming back.
</P>
<P>
   After last week's voting, Murr was quoted by the newspaper As
Safir: ``Even the support of 70 Parliament members will not be
enough to get Hariri to the prime ministry slot, because everyone
knows how a prime minister is manufactured in Lebanon,'' he said.
``The basic element in this process is a consensus between Syria
and the president about the new prime minister. It seems that many
are not fully aware of the depth of the strategic relationship that
exists between President Emile Lahoud and President Bashar Assad.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, at least, it would seem difficult to deny Hariri the
office. Under the constitution and the 1989 Taif agreement _
brokered by the United States, Saudi Arabia and Syria to end the
bloody sectarian war _ the president must be a Maronite Catholic
and his prime minister a Sunni Moslem, to be named after binding
talks with Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, this usually means a number of hopefuls might
assemble blocks of supporters, and Syria would weigh in, using its
influence over Lebanese politicians to assemble a simple majority
for its candidate. In the departing Parliament, Hariri had only a
14-member bloc and about 10 additional sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   But the rules are often flexible.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse is the first major problem for Assad, a
mild-mannered 34-year-old eye doctor and computer enthusiast who
inherited leadership of Syria, along with the rank of lieutenant
general and commander of the army, upon the death in June of his
father, Hafez Assad, who had run both countries with ruthless
skill.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a particularly difficult impasse. Two years ago, the
younger Assad was given responsibility over Lebanon as part of his
training to assume leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In his first exercise of power, he selected Lahoud, a military
commander with no political base, to be president. This also, in
effect, meant firing Hariri, who was detested by Lahoud but was a
favorite of the Syrian officials who had been in charge of Lebanon:
the longtime vice president, Abdul Halim Khaddam, and a military
intelligence chief, Maj. Gen. Ghazi Kanaan.
</P>
<P>
   For a week, the top-ranking Lebanese politicians have been
trooping to Damascus to meet with Assad, as they had so often
before been summoned by his father.
</P>
<P>
   But the signals from Syria were far from clear. Some Beirut
newspapers have reported that Damascus wanted no further electoral
embarrassment to its loyal supporter, Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the speaker of Parliament, Nabih
Berri, leader of the Shiite Muslim Amal movement, who is noted for
being acutely responsive to Syrian desires, returned from Damascus,
stopping off to see Kanaan at Syrian intelligence headquarters in
the Bekaa region, and promptly announced that his joint
Amal-Hezbollah ticket in the south would join in alliance with
Hariri.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri's forces are contesting 18 of the 19 seats in three
districts in Beirut, the main battleground on Sunday, each reserved
for a specific religious sect. Berri's 23 candidates on the
Amal-Hezbollah ticket are expected to sweep the south, which was
freed in May from more than 20 years of Israeli occupation, and
Hariri should pick up a dozen or so Christian seats in the Bekaa
and other places.
</P>
<P>
   While political alliances in Lebanon are often fragile and
shifting, sometimes in bloody ways, the current situation
represents a major change. Broadly speaking, usually contending
religious groups _ the basic political division here _ have been
brought into an unusual alliance against the government.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, Walid Jumblatt, hereditary chieftain of the Druse,
an offshoot of Islam, and a major ally of Hariri, has reached
across the old civil war lines to befriend his former enemies on
the Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   And there are even hints, until now unspeakable, of challenges
to Syria's long domination. In a three-hour television interview
the other night, Jumblatt said he was calling for ``a correction of
the relationship with Syria to be re-established on a balanced
basis.''

WINDS OF CHANGE STIR EMOTIONS OF A CREW 
</HEADLINE>
  By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aboard a giant multihull like PlayStation, Steve Fossett's
otherworldly 105-foot catamaran, the anemometer, or wind-speed
indicator, not only imparts invaluable information, it also serves
as a reasonable guide to the emotional well-being of the boat's
12-man crew.
</P>
<P>
   Anything under 10 knots of wind can signal an aura of deep
frustration. Numbers in the range of 15 to 30 knots are generally
accompanied by a sense of profound gratification. But once the
gadget registers 60 knots or more, the overall mood can range from
serious concern to abject terror.
</P>
<P>
   The sailors aboard PlayStation have experienced the full
spectrum of wind speeds and sentiments since the boat began
Atlantic Ocean sea trials last December.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, off the coast of England in the final miles of
what had started as a brilliant attempt to break the record for the
fastest crossing of the Atlantic under sail, it was light air, not
big breeze, that instilled the collective case of onboard ennui.
</P>
<P>
   After setting out from New York on Aug. 23 and maintaining a
pace that would have shattered the mark of 6 days 13 hours 3
minutes, the endeavor came undone four days later when Fossett and
his mates sailed into a relatively windless hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' said Fossett on Thursday via satellite
telephone shortly after sailing into the English Channel to
complete his third Atlantic crossing of the year, this one in a
highly respectable time of 7 days 9 hours 3 minutes. ``Breaking
this record was our primary objective for this year. But we have a
great future to look forward to because the boat is very well
sorted out now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sailing another big cat called Jet Services, the Frenchman Serge
Madec posted the current multihull mark some 10 years ago. The
separate record for monohull yachts of 8 days 23 hours 59 minutes,
was set in 1998 by the American businessman Robert Miller's
145-foot Mari-Cha III.
</P>
<P>
   At least two maxi yachts, Gianni Agnelli's Stealth and Ludde
Ingvall's Skandia, had planned assaults on Miller's mark this year
but abandoned the notion because of unsatisfactory forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   And now, after Fossett's failed run, there are no record
attempts scheduled in the immediate future. So it appears both
records are safe for another year. As Fossett has learned, it takes
not only a fast boat but also a rare convergence of ideal weather
systems to have a genuine shot at a record.
</P>
<P>
   PlayStation's core crew spent weeks in Manhattan's Chelsea Hotel
waiting for the perfect forecast. Finally, the meteorologist Bob
Rice saw what he was looking for.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front, accompanied by strong southerly winds, was bearing
down on New York and promised a quick getaway. Out in the Atlantic,
the remains of Hurricane Alberto were conspiring with a strong
mid-ocean high-pressure system to pump out more stiff southerlies
in the 20- to 35-knot range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got on a very good weather pattern and started knocking out
500 days for the first three days,'' Fossett said. ``It started to
look real promising and we thought we might arrive in
five-and-a-half days.''
</P>
<P>
   The sweet sailing didn't last.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 900 miles out we realized it was all going to fall apart
and it degenerated into a 350-mile day followed by a day that was
only a little over 100 miles,'' Fossett said. ``The weather systems
tend to pile up as you approach the continent and there's a much
greater vulnerability to running out of wind.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final stages, in the midst of a lightning storm,
navigator Stan Honey got a scare when he received an electrical
jolt while disconnecting instruments at his nav station. ``He
realized we were at a risk to have all our electrical systems short
out and he picked up a big static charge from the lightning,''
Fossett said. ``It gave him a pretty sore arm.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first frightening moment aboard PlayStation, which
almost pitchpoled _ or tripped end over end _ while screaming ahead
of a 63-knot blast of wind on its first, aborted transatlantic
record attempt last December.
</P>
<P>
   But Fossett believes the thousands of miles the boat and crew
have since weathered will put them in good stead for coming
adventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an enormously powerful boat but we're getting used to
it,'' Fossett said, ``and we're getting to like that power.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks ahead, PlayStation's hulls will be stretched by 20
feet apiece to bring the boat's overall length to 125 feet. ``We
have too much sail area and the boat will be better balanced
then,'' said Fossett. Afterwards, Fossett has entered PlayStation
in The Race, the round-the-world event scheduled to begin in
Barcelona, Spain, on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   But Fossett said he would wait to see the final entry list
before fully committing to the event; a separate attempt at the
nonstop round-the-world record of 71 days is also a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't want to go if there were only three boats
starting, for instance,'' he said. ``On the other hand, if there
are five properly prepared boats on the line it would be very
exciting. So we're going to let the other people entered make that
final decision for us.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WHERE'S THE DIGNITY? 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuck in your shirt. That's what our moms always told us, but
what did they know? Now, there is a great international
shirt-raising movement.
</P>
<P>
   The other day at a tennis clinic, a number of women asked _
begged, beseeched, goaded, teased _ the young dude Jan-Michael
Gambill to raise his shirt high enough so they could get a glimpse
of his abs. Needless to say, he obliged.
</P>
<P>
   Show us your abs! Show us your abs! This is the female suburban
version of the sound at auto races and the infield of the Kentucky
Derby, where roving packs of men chant a somewhat similar demand at
women, some of whom cooperate and some of whom keep moving before
it gets even uglier.
</P>
<P>
   Now, shirts are flying. Brandi Chastain at the World Cup. Andre
Agassi practicing with his shirt off. Guys with truly ugly bodies
running bare-chested in the public streets, badly in need of a
citation from the Beauty Police. Soccer players whipping off
jerseys at every goal until they start getting yellow-carded, which
creates a worldwide 38th Parallel above which they cannot yank.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Jenny Thompson, aspirant to swimming gold medals
at the Summer Games, who voluntarily pulled off the top of her
bathing suit during a photo shoot for Sports Illustrated. She posed
with her fists strategically in front of her chest while the old
pro from SI clicked off a few shots, with Thompson's boyfriend
standing nearby, reportedly with no problem whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   It was 30 seconds of hi-jinks among friends, or maybe it was
calculated, but needless to say the magazine went big with the
photo, and the polemics have been raging ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The debate crosses all the demographics. A guy half my age, whom
I often call for advice, thinks it was a tacky move on Thompson's
part. One woman I know says, no harm, no foul. A male columnist
whom I respect says the prudes should all lighten up. A lot of
women I know are offended.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I reacted both ways. I read every word of the
excellent article, liked Thompson a lot, and enjoyed the photo of
her confidence, her muscles, her posture, her athleticism, and so
on and so on. Anybody who says her pose was not partly about sex is
being hypocritical, but then again, so am I, because I looked more
than once, before I asked, ``Gee, I wonder if she should be doing
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Women, after all, are trying to get past the tendencies of men
to run in dog packs and throw cold water on women, and start
groping them, as was recently done in Central Park in New York. It
doesn't do to say that women should not be wearing suggestive
outfits on a warm Sunday in the park. The men acted like wanton
animals. But is there something going on in our culture that gives
men permission to act like that?
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't have anything to do with the double standard in
television, the print media, advertising, movies, videos, pro
wrestling sadomasachists, our entire sex-obsessed public life,
could it? In this day and age, women are still worth geometrically
more if they vamp, even world-level athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson does not see it that way. The swimmer is en route to
Sydney, so her agent, Sue Rodin, spoke for her the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing seductive in that pose,'' Rodin said. ``Jenny
said, `I worked hard for that body and I'm proud of it.' I'd like
people to talk more about her accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be fine except that Thompson changed the mood by
whipping off her top for the same folks who give us that annual
foolishness called the Swimsuit Issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two issues here,'' said Donna Lopiano, the president
of the Women's Sports Foundation. ``One was Jenny's decision. Did
she stop to think about her impact on younger women? Would a
sportswriter tell his 10-year-old daughter, `You can do that some
day?' I doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other issue is the ethical decision of the media,''
Lopiano added. ``I haven't seen a nude photo of Tiger Woods with
his hands in front of him, and I don't think I will.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that male athletes do not relish the impact
of their physiques as well as the aura of their athletic
accomplishments. Many enjoy being photographed without shirts on.
In American society, there still is a double standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to the beach in Europe and most women don't have tops
on,'' said one of my Italian journalist friends. ``Maybe you look,
but it's not a big deal.'' Of course, my European friends can't
understand Watergate or Clintongate, either. They think we're nuts.
</P>
<P>
   The debate goes on at the U.S. Open, where Venus and Serena
Williams squeeze their healthy physiques into tennis dresses of
their own design, featuring tight fabric and strategic cutouts. I
sat with three African-American women with tennis backgrounds
during a Williams match not long ago, and they were rolling their
eyes as if to say, girl, get some clothes on.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Anna Kournikova, who wears outfits that could be
labeled Late Lolita or Early Bardot. She can play but has never won
a tournament, and is making a ton of money from advertisements
commissioned with a knowing leer by all concerned, whether she
wants to admit it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's into the double-standard act. American Express is
using an advertisement that calls Bjorn Borg a ``stalwart'' but
Martina Hingis a ``femme fatale.'' What's that all about? I could
get really angry about star female athletes mimicking the doxies
that many men want them to be, and I'm sure somebody would say,
``Hey, Mack, keep your shirt on.'' Everybody should.

ON PILGRIMS' LAND, MEGAPROJECTS LOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLYMOUTH, Mass. _ For 340 years after the Pilgrims settled here,
Plymouth and its neighbors in southeast Massachusetts grew very
slowly. Then in 30 years, from 1960 to 1990, the population of this
103-square-mile town, the state's largest municipality and still a
sizable slice of cranberry growing country, tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Better transportation, good schools, lots of land, reasonable
prices and proximity to the jobs in Boston and its beltways
attracted families seeking single-family houses in traditional
subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   While eager for growth, this town of 50,000 residents and its
neighbors in the still rural region began feeling overwhelmed and
took various planning measures to deal with the rapid expansion.
But that boom seems modest compared to what is coming:
megaprojects.
</P>
<P>
   In Plymouth, construction is under way on a 3,000-acre mixed-use
project with almost 3,000 luxury houses that will be the town's
biggest development so far. That project, called Pinehills, will in
turn be dwarfed by another being planned by A.D. Makepeace Co., a
major cranberry grower. The company has filed preliminary plans for
tract subdivisions that could contain 3,000 to 7,000 houses on
9,600 acres spanning Plymouth, Carver and Wareham.
</P>
<P>
   The megaprojects have brought worries for these communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The towns are scared to death of losing their open space and
having a demand for services _ schools, water, sewer and fire
protection _ they can't provide,'' said John Lenox, the town
planner here. ``So they've enacted building caps, moratoriums;
increased minimum lot sizes; or overencouraged commercial
development, all of which consumes twice as much open space.''
</P>
<P>
   While Plymouth has a full-time government and a professional
town planner able to promulgate sophisticated zoning, its small
neighbors have only part-time officials, explained Steven Smith,
executive director of the Southeastern Regional Planning and
Economic Development District, a federally financed agency working
with all of the towns and developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The region isn't prepared for the growth that's coming,'' he
said. ``Most of the zoning doesn't give the towns or developers
much choice other than large-lot, single-family subdivisions that
spread all over the hills.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Smith and others worry that the 51 towns from Duxbury
(about 30 miles south of Boston) to Westport (just shy of the Rhode
Island border) will not have the tax base to deliver resident
services or the regulations to prevent the still sparsely settled
hills, bogs and beaches from being plowed under or polluted.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the growing attraction of this area is that it is one of
the few regions in eastern Massachusetts with moderately priced
single-family houses. The average selling price in Plymouth this
summer was $204,682. In Boston it was $823,000 for a house of fewer
than 2,400 square feet; for a larger house, it was $1.4 million,
said Debra Taylor, owner of Link, a real estate information service
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers like Michael Bash found both more house and a country way
of life in Plymouth that is not available closer to his
Boston-based cleaning company. Last fall Bash; his wife, Ellen; and
their two daughters moved into a 2,800-square-foot four-bedroom
house in Harrison Woods. This 32-lot subdivision, deftly tucked
into a wooded 125-acre site, has a private 22-acre pond good for
swimming, fishing and kayaking. House prices range from about
$300,000 to $400,000, said Vivian Mulligan, who with her husband,
Patrick, is the developer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plymouth has breathing room,'' said Bash, who moved here from
Hull, a tightly packed beach resort just south of Boston, where he
had lived for 40 years. ``You have your privacy and nice neighbors,
excellent schools, more house for your money. And the extra commute
isn't much.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan Homes bought the site, a former Boy Scout camp, in 1997
and started construction the next year. The first buyers moved in
last year. Now 20 homes are occupied, six more are being built and
the Mulligans are holding the last six lots as an investment. They
expect to complete construction of the 26 homes and the surrounding
roads by mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Harrison Woods and similar subdivisions have fed
the growth here. Now a new era of larger-scale development is
dawning as construction on the $1 billion Pinehills proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Three years of planning will result in 2,854 attached and
detached houses priced from about $300,000 to more than $1 million.
The houses will be in clusters, and the 3,037-acre forested site
will include about 2,000 acres of open space offering residents _
mostly empty nesters and retirees _ panoramic views of Cape Cod
Bay, woods and four golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   The developer, Pinehills LLC, has construction financing from
the Fleet National Bank division of the FleetBoston Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has built one mile of roads with underground
utilities, a private well, a 7,400-square-foot office building
called the Summerhouse and seven model homes set for completion in
October, when marketing will begin. Of four golf courses planned,
two are in construction along with a village center, which will
have 1.3 million square feet of commercial space: a hotel,
conference center, retail and offices. The land planner is Sasaki
Associates of Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the megaprojects approach, in the mid-1990's Plymouth
enacted new zoning bylaws. They allow cluster designs for projects
that leave three acres per house somewhere on the site and special
permits for more dense developments like Pinehills. On parcels of
3,000 acres or more, the new zoning allows overlay districts, where
mixed-use projects can be built in areas zoned residential or
agricultural. Because an annual building cap of 185 houses took
effect last year, about 200 new houses are going up now, compared
with 287 in 1999 and 336 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some local and regional planners point to the cluster-zoning
approach taken by Pinehills, which is conserving 70 percent of the
site as open space and building private infrastructure, when they
contemplate what might happen to the vastly larger property being
developed by the Makepeace Co. According to Lenox, the town
planner, ``Pinehills is a positive alternative to the threat of
Makepeace.''
</P>
<P>
   Makepeace owns 13,000 acres in the area. It is considering
building houses on 9,600 acres, which it could also cultivate, but
it is now growing cranberries on only 1,750. Recently, as cranberry
prices fell and home prices rose, the company began focusing on
real estate development.
</P>
<P>
   What worries Lenox is that the company ``might take 9,600 acres
out of agricultural use to build thousands of houses in sprawling
subdivisions that we can't serve.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer Makepeace started working with regional and town
planners to develop an alternative to traditional subdivisions that
would enable it to continue its agricultural activity and leave
open space as well.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish this, the company hopes the towns will change
their zoning to allow New England village style clusters of luxury
houses, a conference center, hotel and golf courses, said John O.
Drew, chairman of Makepeace's real estate arm, Sassomon Holdings.
``We don't want to do sprawling subdivisions, but we will if that's
the only way to protect shareholder value,'' said Drew, a member of
the Makepeace clan, which owns 80 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the regional planner, said, ``The challenge is to rewrite
the zoning so this project is an asset rather than a blight.''
</P>
<P>
   In its attempt to cope, the 35-square-mile town of Carver
introduced a 30-house building cap townwide this summer and a
special permit for cluster zoning, which could mean lengthy
negotiations with developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea isn't to be difficult, but for the town to have some
control as we work with each developer,'' said Sarah Hewins, a
planning board member.
</P>
<P>
   Effective planning and good design will indeed determine the
impact of future growth on all of these towns, said Bash of
Harrison Woods. But he is certain of one thing: buyers will keep
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need someplace to live,'' he said. ``And this is such a
beautiful commute, a few times I drove right past my exit.''

DEALERS STRUGGLE TO COPE WITH RUSH TO REPLACE FIRESTONE TIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Tire and car dealers struggled Saturday to cope with
customers who wanted to go on driving vacations for Labor Day
weekend but were leery of relying on their Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers in hot-weather states like Texas and Florida, where the
bulk of the tire problems have occurred, and in cooler states like
Massachusetts said that most customers were owners of Ford Explorer
sport utility vehicles seeking to replace tires that were among the
6.5 million factory-installed tires recalled on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Few customers had heard of another warning by federal regulators
on Friday afternoon that 1.4 million Firestone after-market tires,
sold at dealerships over the last decade for sport utility vehicles
and pickup trucks, could have even higher rates of tread separation
than the recalled tires.
</P>
<P>
   The heat was already sweltering Saturday morning in Austin,
Texas, when Dorothy Lee arrived at the Firestone dealer in a blue
1999 Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   She not only found five Explorers ahead of her but was told that
she would have to leave her vehicle to have her tires exchanged,
even though she had already waited three weeks for replacement
tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``This blows my whole vacation weekend,'' said Lee, 36, a
nurse's assistant who had been hoping to spend the day relaxing at
home with her family in Kyle, a town 25 miles south of Austin.
``People shouldn't have to wait to get rid of tires that might kill
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto and tire dealers, some of whom were not that busy Saturday,
complained that they had not received instructions from automakers
or from Firestone about how to handle tires covered by the
government's advisory. The advisory recommended that consumers
``consider replacing the tires in question and that you retain all
documentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicky Cerundolo, the manager at Arlington Tire and Auto Center
in Arlington, Mass., said that he had told his staff Saturday
morning that an advisory existed but that he had not yet received a
copy with a list of the specific tires models involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable _ there's so much information out there that you
can't keep up with the information coming out, you can't keep up
with the tires coming in,'' Cerundolo said, adding that no
customers had chosen to buy Firestone tires since the recall began.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, www.nhtsa.dot.gov, carried the advisory with its
list of tire models, but the site had been flooded with inquiries
Saturday, making it hard to make a connection and view the
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia McCafferty, a Firestone spokeswoman, repeated the
company's position Saturday that Firestone dealers would provide
free inspections of any tires and would exchange tires if the
customer insisted, provided that replacement tires were available.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan, General Motors and Ford, all of which had installed some
of the tires covered by Friday's advisory, said they would do
whatever was necessary to satisfy customers, including replacing
tires if customers insisted and if replacements were available.
</P>
<P>
   The automakers said they were trying to inform their dealers
about the advisory.
</P>
<P>
   The highway safety administration said in the advisory that it
had asked Firestone on Wednesday to recall the additional tires and
that the tire maker had refused to do so on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A Ford official who insisted on anonymity said late Friday that
the automaker had not been warned by Firestone of a problem, so
that the advisory caught Ford by surprise, even though the list
included tires installed at the factory on F-150 pickup trucks
between 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little irritated about it,'' the Ford official said.
Officials at Nissan, which had equipped almost 20,000 pickup trucks
from the 1991 to 1994 model years with tires covered by the
advisory, said that they had not been warned by Firestone. GM
officials said they also had no warning.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone declined to comment on whether it alerted its
customers before regulators issued the advisory. Ford and GM are
Firestone's largest customers, while Nissan is a big Bridgestone
customer. Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., based in Nashville, Tenn., is
a unit of Bridgestone of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The tire problems, and particularly the advisory on Friday, have
created a rift between GM and Ford, the world's two largest
automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has increasingly blamed Firestone for the tire problems,
which have mainly caused problems on Ford Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   To GM's irritation, Ford had called for Firestone to conduct a
recall in Venezuela that could encompass some GM sport utility
vehicles; Firestone has refused to do so, citing a lack of evidence
to prove a problem.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford officials welcomed the consumer advisory as an
indication that tire-related deaths were the result of tire
problems and not a vehicle defect. GM officials were dismayed by
the advisory, which included 40,000 tires installed at the assembly
plant on 1991 Chevrolet Blazers in addition to off-road tires sold
at Firestone dealers.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ford, Jon Harmon, said Saturday that Ford had
not suggested to regulators that they issue the advisory to shift
blame from Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon said Ford had not been aware of the data on after-market
tires and had not pointed it out to regulators in the hope that
they might act.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford has stepped up the pressure on Firestone, it has also
done so indirectly on other automakers, by having engineers cut
apart recalled tires to check for tread separation. The company
announced a week ago that it had found separation rates in
Firestone tires from Venezuela that were 500 times higher than the
highest rates among recalled tires in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has already replaced Firestone tires on Explorers in
Venezuela at its expense after Firestone refused to conduct a
recall there.
</P>
<P>
   Brook Lindbert, GM's director of wheel and tire systems, said
late Friday that GM had not encountered problems with Firestone
tires and planned to continue buying them.
</P>
<P>
   GM has not cut apart Firestone tires in the United States or
Venezuela to check for tread separation, and does not plan to do
so, Lindbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Tread separation can be spotted through examination of the tire
by a trained mechanic, who looks for bulges or scalloping where the
tread meets the sidewall, and some drivers can notice a bumpiness
in the ride of a vehicle with tire treads that are beginning to
separate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Harmon questioned whether external examination could spot
the tread separation. ``Sometimes that's true,'' he said, ``but
from what we understand, in many cases there's no warning.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Ford, in its examinations, had found tires that
showed signs on the inside of separating but had no external signs
of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ford and GM are Firestone's main customers, Ford buys a
higher percentage of its tires from Firestone than GM does.
DaimlerChrysler has long relied on Goodyear and Michelin.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that Ford may be successful in blaming Firestone,
sales of Ford Explorers and of Ford vehicles in general have stayed
strong despite the recall.
</P>
<P>
   George Pipas, a Ford market analyst, had predicted last Monday
that Explorer sales in August would be in the ``high 30,000s,'' but
might fall short of the 39,000 Explorers sold in August last year.
But Ford announced on Friday afternoon that it had actually sold
40,157 Explorers last month. Because dealerships were open one more
day in August this year than in the same month last year, the daily
sales rate for Explorers fell less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Inglis, Ford's vice president of North American
operations, said the company had difficulty calculating the
distribution of sales within a month, and had been pleased with the
final total.
</P>
<P>
   But Inglis conceded that Explorer sales would have been stronger
if not for the recall. ``There was some weakening of Explorer
versus where it might have been,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For all models and divisions, Ford's daily sales rate fell 3
percent last month from the pace in August of last year. Excluding
Ford's Land Rover division, which it acquired on June 30, sales
were up less than 0.1 percent in absolute terms and down 3.7
percent in terms of the daily selling rate.

PIERCE LEAVES RAYMOND ON OUTSIDE LOOKING IN

 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The final serve out of the mentally punch-drunk Lisa
Raymond kissed the top of the net and fell back as gently as a
droplet in front of Mary Pierce's feet. But Pierce did not raise
her muscular arms, or flash more than a glimpse of her trademark
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of celebrating a double fault that gave her the match
Saturday at the U.S. Open, Pierce heard a sympathetic sigh released
from the Arthur Ashe Stadium. Pierce understood that her victory
walk to greet Raymond at the net should be made with a delicate
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce knew what Raymond had endured over the past few weeks.
She knew how Raymond had been left off the U.S. Olympic team, and
how more glamorous choices had been made. So the fourth-seeded
Pierce, the French Open champion and part of the in-crowd on the
Tour, was not about to gloat after Raymond's upset bid expired at
the end of a tense second-set tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   With Raymond's ordeal fresh in their minds, the fans urged her
on until the double fault allowed Pierce to escape the third round,
6-4, 7-6 (6). Upon Raymond's exit, there was appreciative applause
for the effort the underdog gave and for the stand against the
system she had made. Less than two weeks removed from losing her
arbitration bid to be named to the Olympic team, a drained Raymond
managed to unearth a performance that almost unnerved Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did a really good job of putting everything behind
me,'' said Raymond, ranked 26th in singles. ``If you can't get up
for a Grand Slam, you can't get up for anything. I realized it was
a Grand Slam, and I said, `Let's go.'''
</P>
<P>
   She simply did not have enough oomph to get by Pierce. Although
Raymond had Pierce in trouble with a 4-1 lead in the second set,
Pierce playing in her first tournament since Wimbledon because of a
sore shoulder, summoned her powers. Suddenly she took control,
unleashing a steady stream of passing shots down the line, blasts
that whizzed past the lunging Raymond. Quickly, Raymond's lead had
been gobbled up by Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Although Raymond gamely fought off three match points, Pierce
was given the last one on the double fault.
</P>
<P>
   The tension in this early match set the table for the rest of
the midday competition taking place under suffocating heat and
humidity. Still, there was energy, particularly emanating from the
cozy confines of Court 10. Upon match point, there was a roar heard
around the grounds when qualifier Hyung Taik Lee stunned Rainer
Schuttler, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4. The success of Lee, who is only the
third Korean to play in a Grand Slam tournament in the Open Era
(1968), has had tennis officials scrambling for a translator. And
as the South Korean drew closer to match point Saturday, there was
even a call sent out to the United Nations in an effort to find
someone to relate Lee's remarkable story.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Lee's miracle streak is near an end _ barring upset,
Pete Sampras will face him in the Round of 16 _ he has provided the
drama of the unexpected during the first week of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other dramas playing out as well. One ongoing
sad saga has involved Jelena Dokic. Early in the tournament, she
was the tearful bystander to another outburst by her father, Damir
Dokic. For the second Grand Slam in a row, he had to be hustled off
the grounds by security. After his tirade, Damir Dokic was banned
from the remainder of the tournament by officials.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, as usual, just pressed onward. On Saturday her
dysfunctional situation seemed to catch up to her game. Facing the
108th-ranked player on the Tour, Francesca Schiavone, Dokic, ranked
43rd, struggled to focus in the first set. She trailed by two
service breaks before regrouping on her way to a 7-6 (4), 7-5
victory in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce managed to regain control, too. Raymond's serve began to
let her down, while Pierce began reaching back and ripping her
ground strokes down the lines. Everything changed after Raymond
gained the 4-1 lead in the second set and was moving in for another
break of serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I would have just consolidated that second break,
you know? But I kind of let her back in that game, then I got tight
on my serve,'' said Raymond, who was broken by Pierce in the sixth
game of the second set. ``It was a matter of a couple of points
that changed the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Raymond's loss marked the end to her Open singles play,
she is still very much alive in doubles as part of the top-seeded
team. But singles is where she was hoping to prove herself, to show
that she could find her niche on an Olympic Dream Team that
included Lindsay Davenport, Venus Williams and Monica Seles before
Serena Williams was added to play doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, it was,'' said Raymond, referring to her lost bid
to gain a spot on the Olympic team as a motivating factor. ``But I
also feel like I didn't have to, that I don't have to prove
anything. My past results have proven I'm a good doubles player and
good singles player. My ranking proves that in both events.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond's top ranking in doubles was at the heart of her
argument over her right to play in the Olympics. She went through
an emotionally draining process of preparing for and taking part in
an arbitration hearing two weeks ago. During the hearing, her
lawyers argued that Raymond, as the No. 1 doubles player in the
world, should be on the team instead of Serena Williams.
</P>
<P>
   When the Olympic women's coach Billie Jean King selected the
team after Wimbledon, Williams did not have a doubles ranking. In
the past, America's top doubles player has occupied the fourth spot
on the team. Although the arbitrator chided the U.S. Tennis
Association for its vague and misleading selection process, Raymond
was turned away.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, Raymond expressed her disappointment with the
arbitrator's decision and detailed her disillusionment with King
and the USTA. The process not only took a toll on her mentally, but
also left her distracted in her preparation for the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been easy,'' Raymond said. ``The two weeks before a
Grand Slam, I think, are the most important. That's when I was
really, that's when this was magnified more than any time, going
through the arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were days where I didn't even play because I was sitting
down with my lawyers and preparing testimony, preparing
declarations, then being in New York for two full days for this
arbitration, then waiting. He took almost 48 hours to make his
decision. It wasn't easy to go out there and practice knowing, `Am
I going? What's going to happen?'''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Raymond, despite her ordeal, nearly pulled off what
would have been the biggest upset so far in the women's draw.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In team sports, certain individual roles carry a historic
cachet: the center fielder for the New York Yankees, the captain of
the Montreal Canadiens, the center for the Los Angeles Lakers. And
in college football, glamour awaits the tailback who runs for the
University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of decades, it seemed as if the man atop the
Heisman Trophy was modeled after the Trojans' tailback. First came
Mike Garrett in 1965, then O.J. Simpson in 1968, followed by
Charles White in 1979 and Marcus Allen in 1981. But no USC runner
has won even all-American honors in almost 20 years, and the team
record over the previous four seasons has been 26-22.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Trojans of 2000 have a tailback who might carry them
along with the ball. He is Sultan McCullough, a sophomore from
Pasadena, Calif., who rushed 29 times for 128 yards last Sunday
when USC opened its season with a 29-5 victory over Penn State in
the Kickoff Classic at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Touted for his sprinter's speed and modestly sized for his
position at 5 foot 11 and 195 pounds, McCullough attacked the
middle of the Nittany Lions' defense, reading blocks, making nifty
cuts and punishing tacklers. He led the Trojans with three pass
receptions and threw a few blocks, too.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Paul Hackett had said he planned to use a three-man
rotation at tailback until someone claimed first-string status.
McCullough may not have clinched the berth, but it could be his to
lose as USC prepares to play host to Colorado next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have any breakaways, he had tough runs,'' Hackett
said. ``He's got great speed, one of the fastest players in college
football. But he's learning to be a tailback. He ran for the tough
yards, over and over again. We had a young tailback who was
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough's confidence was obvious. ``The offensive line was
telling me to run the ball down their throats,'' he said. ``That's
what I was doing. I was ready. I've been ready for months. Whatever
I need, I'm going to get. I'll show them. I run over people, too,
if I have to. That's why we wear pads.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his coaches told him before the Penn State game, ``It's
your turn to shine.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his school's tradition at his position, McCullough said: ``I
know it's `Tailback U.' Four Heismans.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those four Heisman tailbacks, Garrett, who now is the USC
athletic director, said it was premature to declare McCullough the
inheritor of this legacy. But he liked what he saw last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof is in the pudding,'' Garrett said. ``Let's talk
after midseason. He did the basic things a back should do. He
ground it out. He's really more of a breakaway threat. He's a tough
runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett expounded on the art of the running back. ``You have to
have the fast-twitch and the genes to be a great one, but then you
work on refinement,'' he said. ``Running is a game plan of
repetition, same as the offensive linemen go through.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough has the genes. His father, the late Bruce McCullough,
ran track at San Jose State in the 1960s. His mother, Mabel, was a
high-school basketball player on an Arkansas state championship
team. His brother, Saladin, was a tailback at Oregon. McCullough is
the 1999 Pacific-10 Conference champion in the 100-meter dash,
although he said 200 meters is his favorite distance. His best in
the 100 is 10.17 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the gene pool, no question about it,'' Garrett said.
``The McCullough family is a tough background. For Sultan to be
where he is, it's an indication of his toughness and perseverance.
His family life was not the best, a typical black kid who grew up
in a poor neighborhood and his father died. He survived.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough said his first name means ``King'' and that his
father gave it to him because ``my dad was a Muslim at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave it to me and it stuck,'' he said. ``I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sultan is the youngest of six boys. His father died of a heart
attack, in 1986 at age 46, when Sultan was 6 years old. He has few
memories of him, but he said his father was on San Jose State's
track team with Tommie Smith and John Carlos, the 1968 Olympians.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCullough will only be watching the Olympics this
month, he will consider trying out for the 2004 Games. For now, his
football coaches are trying to blend his sprinter's speed with the
aggressiveness of a tailback. That means running through the
interior instead of trying to break wide every play and fly. ``They
tell me to get to the end zone north-south,'' McCullough said.
``But it's cool that I've got enough speed to go east-west.''
</P>
<P>
   A runner like McCullough, who attacks tacklers instead of
waiting to be hit, is less likely to be injured, Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't run with the art that we did before,'' Garrett said
of the running style teams now use. ``When we were running the ball
in our great tradition, we taught running backs to attack the
defense. Sultan certainly is a throwback.''

SPORTS COLUMN: SKEPTICISM IS TAKING A VACATION
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astronomers tell us that the light from dead stars reaches us
long after those bodies are useless and cold, a metaphor we do not
want to deal with this coming autumn in New York when Patrick Ewing
and Mark Messier may once again be the suns around which their
teammates and fans orbit. It could be time to call Madison Square
the Gray Garden.
</P>
<P>
   As disturbing as such thoughts may be, they come at an opportune
time, just as I declare my Olympic moratorium. This is when I
actively suspend all my baser judgments. I disregard suspiciously
muscled bodies and conveniently hypocritical arrangements. I try to
look at the Games through Bud Greenspan's rosy lenses. I offer the
Barons _ de Coubertin, Avery Brundage, Juan Antonio Samaranch, Dick
Ebersol _ safe passage through the waste detectors of my mind. Just
sit back and enjoy the show, I say, and remember that the Olympics,
like ``Survivors'' and ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire,'' is just a
TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Which takes us back to the Patrick mess and standing pat with
Mess. It's life imitating bad art. It is the Garden's version of
``Space Cowboys,'' a missable movie in which old guys who had been
a finger roll away from getting into space 30 years ago get a
second chance because the bureaucrats have something to hide. Of
course we'll root for the codgers because the alternative is ``The
Replacements,'' a must-miss movie (call it ``The Scab News
Bears''). Haven't we had enough of somewhat appealing pickups not
quite doing it for us?
</P>
<P>
   The Patrick and Mess sagas are as different as their sports and
their personalities, but the common thread brings us, alas, back to
the Olympics. While these two foreign-born guest workers have
always given us their best in the arena, decisions about their job
security have always been coldly pragmatic ones. Fair enough,
especially since most recent Garden decisions have also been
popular _ getting Gretzky, bringing in Latrell Sprewell, continuing
the attempt to dump Ewing and buying back Messier.
</P>
<P>
   (Fans, for all their psychological dysfunction, do keep an eye
on the bottom line. In an amusing America Online feature last week,
the $275,000 home that a $30,000 worker might yearn for would
comparatively cost a $12 million star _ say, Peyton Manning or
David Cone _ only $687.50.)
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, the Olympics have been making coldly pragmatic
decisions that have been popular _ feminizing the Games beyond de
Coubertin's most pre-Freudian fears, de-amateurizing the Games
beyond Brundage's worst nightmares. The recent decision to test for
EPO can lead one to believe that either the pharma-jocks have
adequate masking agents or have gone beyond blood into the lymph
system; there would be no testing unless Olympic officials were
sure that no box office star would be busted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another old guy, Samaranch, seems to be in PR rehab.
Last century's buzz around his Nobel Peace Prize bid has yet to
resurface, but there is a softer tone to his profiles and writers
tend to faintly apologize when they bring up his Franco/Fascist
past. Why that should have anything to do with the expedient way
Olympic decisions are made beats me.
</P>
<P>
   I was an unabashed Olympic fan until I actually got to one, in
1968, in Mexico City. A few days before the opening ceremony, a
native showed me the plaza where student demonstrators had been
machine-gunned. That story, like their blood and the hovels along
the road from the airport, was scrubbed off the scoreboard for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Those Games are best remembered for the mildest militant gesture
of the era, the victory-stand black power salutes of Tommie Smith
and John Carlos, and the hysterical official reaction. That's too
bad because it obscures the incredible progress begun in those
Games; the drugs got more effective, the television contracts grew
richer, the athletic Cold War intensified and the shoe money showed
up. Meanwhile, poor Tommie and John were scrubbed for years. One of
their teammates, Tom Waddell, founded the Gay Olympics; before he
died, he would lose his house during the Olympics' successful suit
against his use of their Congress-given name. The Gay Games live
on.
</P>
<P>
   While thelipsite(at)aol.com will be open for dialogue and
diatribe, this space will be vacant for several weeks while I watch
the Open (I would pay to see John McEnroe play either Williams
sister), the Olympics, the pennant race and the football seasons.
</P>
<P>
   I'll especially be watching Tennessee; the administration and
its media lackeys are concerned that professor Linda Bensel-Meyers'
whistle-blowing will cool the Vols' football fever. Faculty groups
seem to be backing away from supporting her, even though her
charges, which need to be thoroughly investigated by an objective
group (i.e., not the NCAA), highlight academic complicity in
college sports corruption. On the other hand, maybe we should just
kick back and be happy that college football is just another coldly
pragmatic TV show, like the Olympics.

OUTDOORS: A RIVER IN ARCTIC RUSSIA  
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLAS KARAS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At one time, whenever someone thought of a great Russian river,
it was always the Volga, made famous by singing boatmen who pulled
and polled their boats from near Moscow to the Caspian Sea. Not
anymore. Among anglers, the Volga's position has been usurped by
the Ponoi and its fantastic largess of Atlantic salmon. In terms of
numbers of fish, it is probably the best salmon river in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Situated on the Kola Peninsula in Arctic Russia, the Ponoi had
been hidden from the world behind the Iron Curtain and the
strategic seaport of Murmansk. And in Stalin's time, these northern
regions were the site of many labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1990, a first sportfishing camp was established on the
Ponoi, 30 miles above the river's mouth. In 1992, more than 7,000
Atlantic salmon, ranging up to 30 pounds, were caught and released
there. The river's prowess has not diminished. In 1996, a second
camp, farther upriver, was established where the Pacha, a small
tributary, enters the Ponoi. Today, both camps together can average
400 to 600 salmon caught a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Kola is shaped like a thumb, roughly 240 miles long and 175
miles wide. Within the last 12 years, nearly two dozen sportfishing
camps have been built there, dotting 90 or so salmon rivers. The
Ponoi is the largest and its watershed dominates the eastern half
of the peninsula. It is a big, gentle river with a slow gradient
until it begins a rapid descent near tidewater. Its waters are dark
because bog leachates from the surrounding tundra stain it;
visibility is often less than two feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sportfishermen in camps here see only one aspect of the
Ponoi,'' Andrei Velikanov said last winter. He is an ichthyologist,
a zoologist who specializes in fish, and he frequently returns to
Russia from his home near Seattle. ``It is a long river with a
different mood at every bend. There are many miles that have never
seen a fly rod. That is why I have organized the Ponoi
Expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of floating on more than a hundred of the Ponoi's 200
miles was Velikanov's. I met him a dozen years ago in a Trout
Unlimited fishermen's exchange when he and a group of Soviet
anglers fished the Beaverkill in the Catskill Mountains of New
York. Ours would be the first group to float the Ponoi. We would
travel from pool to pool, camping at night and fishing during the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Late in June, to get to our jumping-off site, we first drove 150
miles from Murmansk to the mining city of Lovozero. From there, a
helicopter picked us up and flew 70 miles to the Sami, or Lapp,
village of Krasnoshchelye, on the north bank of the Ponoi. The Sami
are descendants of nomadic peoples who inhabited northern
Scandinavia and Russia for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Our group was composed of four additional anglers: Boris
Mirenkov, a rabid fly fisherman and owner of St. Petersburg's
largest tackle shop; Laimis Miknys, a Lithuanian who works in a
plant that produces monofilament fishing lines; Nikolai Kuzin, a
videographer; and Ivan Yermolin, a television producer.
</P>
<P>
   Going down the Ponoi was like floating backward in time. Small
scattered groups of Sami live great distances apart on the river's
banks eking out a living fishing for salmon, trapping, hunting, and
herding reindeer. Our head guide, Andrei Orekhov, a 35-year-old
Sami from Krasnoshchelye, was aided by a dozen others, some Russian
and others Sami. We had four 17-foot aluminum boats pushed by 15
horsepower outboards, and an ancient wooden boat, with a 25
horsepower outboard that was responsible for towing a 20-foot
inflatable raft loaded with tents, food, baggage and anything that
had to accompany us downriver.
</P>
<P>
   We pushed off at 7 p.m. and from the beginning began catching
fish. Grayling and whitefish, and the occasional salmon parr, were
everywhere taking flies. I whipped a barbless No. 18 White Wulff on
a 4-weight fly rod and caught a fish almost immediately. Since we
were well above the Arctic Circle, the sun never set on our six
days on the Ponoi. We quickly learned that you cannot fish 24 hours
a day just because the sun is shining.
</P>
<P>
   Our first overnight was at the head of a slight rapids where
four Sami farm houses were spread out in a large clearing. We
stayed in a low-slung cabin that was probably close to 200 years
old. Archaeologists have determined that the site has been occupied
for more than 4,000 years. Pictographs of hunters and reindeer,
carved on a large, flat stone at the water's edge, dated from 2000
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The farther downriver we traveled, the grayling catches were
fewer and the salmon catches more frequent. At first the salmon
were small, six to eight pounds. It wasn't until we reached the
Sami village of Kanevka that they increased in size. We began
taking a few fish up to 16 pounds and averaged between four and six
fish a day, per rod. For every one we landed, it seemed that two
got away, often with the fly. Almost any streamer pattern seemed to
work. I found that the Mickey Finn produced very well. Because it
is catch-and-release on the Ponoi, traditional double-hooked salmon
flies are seldom used.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ponoi, unlike salmon rivers elsewhere, the fish migrate
upriver from late May to October. However, the first spring run is
impossible to fish because the river is often in flood stage. After
the first or second week of June, the river becomes fishable.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m. on our last day, we stood on an exposed gravel bar in
the middle of the river about 20 miles below Kanevka, six
fish-weary, unshaven and red-eyed anglers, now certified
Ponoichicks, and greeted a huge helicopter. Orekhov, our guide,
accompanied us to Murmansk, where he was to greet six Finnish
anglers who would retrace our route.

be relegated to the upper half of the stadium. The U.S. Soccer

 &HT;    Home noise key to U.S. men
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the U.S. women's soccer team plays a home game,
it can count on a large crowd of fresh-faced suburban youngsters in
full uniform squealing ``USA! USA!'' and ``Mia!'' in alternating
breaths.
</P>
<P>
   When their male counterparts take the field on American soil,
they usually hear the deafening noise of drums, whistles and ritual
chants and songs from a majority of the onlookers _ cheering for
their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But after opening World Cup qualifying in Guatemala with a 1-1
draw in July that included the usual pranks it receives the road,
the U.S. men and their supporters are employing their own brand of
gamesmanship. The CONCACAF Group E rematch at a sold-out RFK
Stadium in Washington not only could produce a rare pro-American
crowd but also would reduce the Guatemala legion to the upper deck.
The U.S. Soccer Federation reserved the lower-level seats for
season-ticket holders of Major League Soccer club D.C. United and
area youth teams.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the chance to take a major step toward the next
phase of qualifying. The United States is coming off its biggest
qualifying victory ever, a 7-0 rout of Barbados in August, and is
1-1-1 with four points. So is Guatemala, which never has beaten the
Americans in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first match, the U.S. team had to deal with the
typical machinations of playing in Central America. The venue was
switched from the capital of Guatemala City to Mazatenango, a
provincial city three hours away. And Guatemala fans sang and made
noise outside the Americans' hotel long into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear people say that the American fans have been outnumbered
some times in the past, but when we get to the stadium it will
still feel like a home game for us,'' U.S. midfielder John O'Brien
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, American fans, led by the ``Sam's Army'' fan club,
are trying to do their part. Internet postings update American
supporters on the latest Guatemala team hotel switch. And the D.C.
United fan club has renamed its RFK point of entry the
``Gotta-Maul-Em Gate.''

MUSEUM'S PLANS FOR EXPANSION OPPOSED BY NEIGHBORS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The relationship between the Museum of Modern Art and
the residents who live near its towering, grand white complex has
for the last decade been one of cordial appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   When residents had a complaint, both sides say, the museum did
its best to take their concerns into consideration. When the museum
needed government approval for a zoning variance or other
accommodation, its next-door neighbors often spoke up on its
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But the civil tone has ceased. On Wednesday the two sides plan
to go before the City Planning Commission with a dispute over the
museum's plans for its largest expansion since 1984, when it
undertook an $85 million project that included the construction of
a huge condominium tower and reduced the size of a garden.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials have requested changes to a portion of the
Midtown zoning map that would allow them to build a movie theater,
an educational wing and several new galleries. Plans also call for
creating a new restaurant, adding loading docks and building
another major entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors say that the plans are not well thought out, would
bring an unbearable amount of traffic to the area and would block
spectacular views of the stained-glass windows of St. Thomas
Church, a New York City landmark building.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of a few months, what had been a comfortable
coexistence has ended in a Manhattan-style development battle,
pitting the politically powerful museum in one corner against its
very well-to-do neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there are prices of living in a nice part of
Manhattan,'' said Michael S. Gruen, a lawyer hired by a group of
residents of West 54th Street. ``But changed zoning is not
necessarily one of them, especially when the requests for zoning
changes come every 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the museum has publicly been mum on the opposition
since it lost the latest round of the battle two weeks ago: the
Manhattan Borough Board, which is made up of elected officials,
refused to endorse the zoning changes. Mary Lou Strahlendorff, a
spokeswoman for the museum, said that most of the residents'
concerns were addressed in a recently released environmental impact
study.
</P>
<P>
   If allowed to go forward with the expansion, the museum says, it
will be able to double the number of schoolchildren it serves,
bring more jobs to the community and increase the number of annual
visitors to 2.5 million from 1.8 million. The museum hopes to
complete the expansion, which would add 410,000 to 633,050 square
feet of space, by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Planning Commission's approval, museum officials
will have to go back to the drawing board. If the commission does
approve the plan, it will go before the City Council for a vote.
The commission is expected to act by Oct. 6, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, museum officials met privately with a group of
residents opposed to the plan but were unable to win them over,
according to several people familiar with the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Gruen, the residents' lawyer, said the resilience of the
opposition was easily explained: ``The museum got a sweet deal in
1984. It got an enormous condominium tower, and that's why it is
flush with cash now. I am not sure it is entitled to this at the
expense of its neighbors.'' &QL;

TATIANA RIABOUCHINSKA, 83, BALLERINA AND DISNEY MODEL
</HEADLINE>
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tatiana Riabouchinska, an international ballet star who was the
model for the dancing hippopotamus in the 1940 film ``Fantasia''
and the oldest of the three ``baby ballerinas'' who brought fame to
the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in the 1930s, died on Aug. 24 in
Los Angeles. She was 83 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Riabouchinska began her ballet career at 14 and continued
performing into the early 1950s, dancing most notably with the
Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from 1932 to 1942 in works by George
Balanchine, Leonide Massine and David Lichine, whom she married in
1943. She was celebrated for the joyousness and warmth of her
dancing and for her musicality and lightness. Her jumps were high
and soft, her footwork quick and her arms exceptionally beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the impetus is exactly right, she strikes you as
dancing her whole number on an impulse, spontaneously for the joy
of it,'' the critic Edwin Denby wrote of her.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Moscow, Riabouchinska was put under house arrest early
in the Russian Revolution along with her father, who was a banker
for the czar, and her mother and three siblings. But their servants
helped the mother and four children escape and they fled to France,
eventually settling in Paris. There Riabouchinska studied with
Russian teachers, including Mathilde Kschessinska, who had been a
prima ballerina at the Mariinsky Ballet and the mistress of the
czar.
</P>
<P>
   Riabouchinska was spotted by Balanchine while dancing in a
Schiaparelli costume in the Chauve Souris, a fashionable Paris
revue. He signed her to the Ballet Russe, which she joined at 15,
becoming the oldest of the three dancers who were known as the baby
ballerinas. Riabouchinska went on to dance with companies including
Ballet Theater, Les Ballets des Champs-Elysees and the London
Festival Ballet. Disney animators sketching rehearsals used her for
the hippopotamus ballerina in Disney's 1940 movie ``Fantasia,''
with her husband the model for the alligator. The two were also
seen dancing in silhouette in the 1946 cartoon ``Make Mine Music.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lichines retired in Los Angeles in 1950, opening a school in
Beverly Hills and forming the Ballet de la Ville des Anges and
several other companies that failed to receive enough financial
support to last long. After Lichine's death in 1972, Riabouchinska
ran the school until 1998. She continued to teach ballet at another
school up to her death.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a daughter, Tania Lichine Crawford of Los
Angeles, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Riabouchinska, a trouper from an early age, was known for her
equanimity. In comparing dancers of her day with those of today,
she said, ``We had fun, but they just have hard work.''

ON THE STUMP, THE HOT TOPIC IS EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No self-respecting candidate for public office _ be it for
president, Congress or county commissioner _ gets on the stump
these days without something to say about education. Sometimes it
seems as if everyone's running for school board.
</P>
<P>
   Some call for higher standards for teachers, or their charges.
Others think vouchers are the answer, so that parents can choose
public or private schools. Some politicians cheer for charter
schools. Others promise billions for classroom construction or
universal prekindergarten. No doubt about it: public education is
having its moment in the political sun.
</P>
<P>
   But the people who actually work in the schools or send their
children there are less than impressed. Interviews with teachers,
school officials and parents in the New York metropolitan region
found a good deal of cynicism that regards all the talk as just
talk, a popular way to get votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have something to talk about,'' said the president
of the Hempstead Village Board of Education on Long Island, April
Jones-White. ``They've got to find a new arena, and education has
not been the arena'' until now, she added.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones-White's tone was agitated. Even with all the talk, she
has not heard much about several topics she cares about
passionately, including parental involvement and cultivating
relationships between schools and local businesses. ``The dropout
rate is alarming, and children are having children,'' she said. ``I
am looking for more creative programming, and I don't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Slightly more optimistic but also more weary is Robert Burns,
principal of Public School 86 in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. He
said he wanted to believe that some good has to come from the
various education proposals offered by George W. Bush and Al Gore,
but expressed concern about just what that might be. He has no
taste for vouchers that allow school choice, as Bush advocates, and
is equally wary of shuttering failing schools, as Gore has
proposed. But, he contended, a way to improve schools can be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inevitably, something good will come of it,'' Burns said of
the attention to education, ``even though they never approach it in
a totally logical sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald O. Ross, the superintendent of the Mount Vernon public
school system, among the poorest in the state, has worked as a
teacher and administrator for more than 30 years. The overriding
problem, as he sees it, is a dearth of independent research on what
actually works. The slightest whiff of apparent success _ a limited
study asserting test scores went up for some students who received
vouchers to attend private schools, say _ yields a headlong, and
possibly misplaced, rush of support, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vouchers and charter schools will never save public education,
and everybody knows that,'' said Ross, who contends that early
promising results have more to do with the fact that children whose
parents went to the trouble of choosing a school are likely to care
a great deal about education. And that advantage is hard to
replicate. ``If you want me to educate everybody, give me the
resources to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis McCall Jr., a father of four from the Bronx, hears a lot
of ambitious proposals, but is still not sure what they would do to
solve overcrowding in his children's schools or attract more
competent administrators. Vouchers? That might work if everybody
got them, McCall said. Charter schools? If everybody could go. Too
often, though, the big ideas, and even some of the simpler ones,
never get off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they start talking about building a school and then
it just falls through,'' McCall said. ``They say teachers are not
experienced, and then they keep hiring inexperienced teachers.
Everybody says something about what they're going to do, and then
it's like they forget about it. They forget about the low-income
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps people expect too much. Candidates on the stump, even
those who are running for school board, cannot possibly deliver on
everything. Education is infinitely complex; what works in one
school or a classroom may not work in the next. Then there is the
multilayer system of school financing, with money flowing from
local, state and federal governments.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the source of the money, how it is spent can be greatly
influenced by a president or a senator or a mayor through ``the
bully pulpit and the tone'' they set, said Augusta Kappner, the
president of the Bank Street College of Education in Manhattan and
a former assistant secretary of education in the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``All administrations and all parties have to learn that there
is no one-size-fits-all answer,'' Kappner said. ``There is so much
community diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   People like the president of the New York State School Boards
Association, Edward McCormick, say they sense an opportunity to
capitalize on all the political discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like both parties are trying to outdo each other,''
said McCormick, a member of the Arlington school board in Dutchess
County. ``I think that's wonderful. Let the battle begin. What
should happen out of all that, unless this is the greatest con game
of the past two centuries, is some meaningful, productive changes
for children.''

A DOMINANT KILE LEADS CARDINALS OVER METS
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Saturday, for the second time in 17 hours, the St.
Louis Cardinals streamed from their dugout at Busch Stadium and
mobbed a hero in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, they swarmed Jim Edmonds at home plate after a
game-winning home run. This time, the man in the mob was Fernando
Vina, who slapped a single just past the diving New York Mets third
baseman, Robin Ventura, to give the Cardinals a 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Kile must have been somewhere in that happy throng, and
if he was not the center of attention, he should have been. Kile
(16-9) retired the last 18 Mets he faced in a brilliant complete
game victory. In doing so, he outpitched his former Houston Astros
teammate, Mike Hampton, who worked into the ninth inning but lost
for the first time in seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Drew led off the ninth inning with a double to right,
sliding into second just ahead of a strong throw from the rookie
Timoniel Perez. A sacrifice bunt moved Drew to third, and after
Hampton threw ball one to Mike Matheny, Mets manager Bobby
Valentine called on his closer, Armando Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez has been the best reliever in baseball, according to the
scoring system used by Rolaids for their Relief Man award. But he
was mortal here. He walked Thomas Howard _ who batted for Matheny _
then struck out Ray Lankford. But Ventura could not stop Vina's hit
down the third-base line, and it brought home Drew, sent a dugout
of giddy Cardinals onto the field and 41,483 fans home happy.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton and Kile were teammates on the Houston Astros from
1994-97, before Kile left to sign with Colorado as a free agent.
The last two years were disastrous for Kile, who never adapted to
the thin air in Denver and went 21-30 with a 5.82 earned run
average.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he has returned to the All-Star form he showed with
the Astros. His ERA is still above 4.00 because of one awful game
at Coors Field in April, but Kile is 15-9 and among the league
leaders in victories, innings and strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton came back from his own April struggles this year, and
since May has been every bit the ace he was for Houston in '99. He
entered the game 11-3 with a 2.36 ERAin his last 21 starts, and has
been especially sharp lately. Hampton allowed no homers in August,
and he had won his last four decisions coming into the game.
</P>
<P>
   He got a lead Saturday in the fourth inning. Edgardo Alfonzo led
off the fourth with a double, just his fifth career hit in 28
at-bats off Kile. Robin Ventura, who went nearly 50 at-bats without
driving in a run before his homer on Friday, lined a single to left
to bring in Alfonzo and give the Mets a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is still hitting below .240 despite good power numbers,
and it is a good sign for the Mets when he singles to the opposite
field. But if the Mets were mounting a rally, Kile squelched it
there.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out Todd Zeile on a disputed check-swing, got Benny
Agbayani to fly to center, then dropped to a sidearm angle and
retired Jay Payton on a pop-up, ending the inning. Kile's next five
innings were perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were getting to Hampton, but until the sixth he
had frustrated them. He hit Fernando Vina in the shoulder with the
first pitch of the game, but the Cardinals left runners at the
corners when Craig Paquette flied to center.
</P>
<P>
   A double play grounder ended the Cardinals' second, Hampton
outlasted Jim Edmonds on a nine-pitch at-bat to end the third,
striking him out, and Payton tracked down Paquette's smash to the
center-field warning track in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals finally struck in the sixth. Eric Davis, a
career .571 hitter off Hampton before the game, grounded into a
double play with two men on. Hampton went after Paquette with a
good slider low in the zone, but Paquette lifted it to left for a
single, scoring Placido Polanco from third. The game was tied, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Timoniel Perez made his first major league start Saturday,
batting leadoff and playing right field a few hours after a
baserunning decision in his debut helped sink the Mets on Friday
night. After singling in his first at-bat in that game, Perez was
not told to stay on first, and he was caught stealing to end the
ninth inning with Alfonzo at bat.
</P>
<P>
   Perez later admitted he was not concentrating enough and said he
regretted the decision. But manager Bobby Valentine liked what he
saw at the plate, and he had planned all along to start him
Saturday. With right fielder Derek Bell limited to pinch-hitting
because of a sore knee and hip and Darryl Hamilton having played
Friday night, it was a natural fit to start Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, who prefers Benny Agbayani leading off and does not
believe a leadoff hitter must be a smallish speedy guy, joked that
his critics have found their man in Perez. ``People will be happy
when they see him leading off,'' Valentine said. ``They'll think we
finally found someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez tried to bunt for a hit with two outs and the bases empty
in the eighth, but he popped up to the first baseman, Paquette, in
foul territory. Perez went 0 for 4, and Valentine said Agbayani
will lead off on Sunday.

JAPAN ORDERS RESIDENTS OUT AFTER TREMORS ROCK ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Changes ``1985'' to ``1995'' in 8th graf, beginning ``These
fears ...'') 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ After two months of sporadic eruptions and frequent,
earth-shaking tremors in an island chain south of Tokyo, officials
Friday ordered the complete evacuation of Miyake Island, which has
been at the center of the seismic activity.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation, ordered almost simultaneously by the mayor of
Miyake, and by the governor of Tokyo prefecture, comes after almost
half of the island's 3,850 inhabitants had quietly left the island
to escape what has become near-constant volcanic activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision was made because the earthquakes and eruptions
have become so frequent that they represent a risk to human
lives,'' said Keita Takashima, a spokesman for the Tokyo
government.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation marks the second time in recent months that
volcanic activity has forced large-scale relocations in Japan.
Earlier this year, 13,000 people were evacuated from villages in
northern Japan near Mount Usu, after a major eruption of a volcano
that had been dormant there for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since it lies only 120 miles south of the capital, Tokyo, the
eruptions of Mount Oyama on Miyake have revived fears here of a
huge disaster in the case of a major earthquake. Several powerful
tremors have been felt in the capital itself, with one of them
reportedly caused by movements in the earth's crust deep below the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that the frequent tremors and eruptions on Miyake,
and throughout the surrounding Ise island chain, have made this
summer one of the most seismically active seasons on record.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say that the seismic activity in the Ise chain is
caused by shifts in huge underground pools of magma, but there is
disagreement among them over its relevance to Tokyo's tectonic
stability.
</P>
<P>
   These fears are reinforced by the still vivid memories of the
devastation of Kobe, a major port city southwest of Tokyo that was
struck by a violent earthquake in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was also the anniversary of the Great Tokyo Earthquake of
1923, which killed an estimated 150,000 people and left most of the
city burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result of the Kobe quake, the Tokyo government has
organized its largest annual emergency preparations drill on
Sunday, which is traditionally held at the beginning of September,
in commemoration of the huge quake that destroyed this city.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the prefectural government has called out
more than 7,000 members of the Self-Defense Forces, including
members of its air, sea and maritime branches, for highly visible
drills that include military-style rescue maneuvers involving
helicopters, light tanks, troop transport vehicles and landing
craft.
</P>
<P>
   The drills have fueled a major polemic here in a Japan, which
remains officially pacifist and without an army, about the role of
the Self-Defense Forces. Anti-militarists here say they suspect
that an unstated goal of the high-profile exercise is to raise the
profile of the armed forces gradually, improving the prospects for
conservative proposals to revise the constitution to allow Japan to
form an army for the first time since World War II.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The debate over the exercises has also involved complaints that
it is aimed at intimidating foreign Asians who reside in Japan
after menacing comments five months ago by Tokyo's governor,
Shintaro Ishihara.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many third-country nationals and foreigners who have entered
Japan illegally have perpetrated heinous crimes,'' Ishihara said in
April. ``In the event of a major earthquake, riots may break out,
and there is a limit to the police's ability to cope with such a
situation alone. I want you, the Self-Defense Forces, to carry out

were lynched and their property stolen or destroyed by rioting
Japanese who had been whipped up by xenophobic local leaders during
in the Great Tokyo Earthquake.

DEMOCRATS SMELL BLOOD ON MANHATTAN'S EAST SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last three decades, state Sen. Roy M. Goodman has
become a fixture in the politics of Manhattan's East Side and a
leader of the moderate wing of the state's Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But as Goodman, 70, runs for a 17th term this year, the
Democratic Party is hoping to put to an end the Goodman era in
Albany. And the race to determine Goodman's Democratic challenger
has developed into one of the most hotly contested state Senate
primaries of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The race, in the 26th Senate District, has attracted much
attention in New York City and beyond because Goodman is considered
to be among a group of vulnerable Republican incumbents. In the
1998 election, Goodman had the weakest showing of any incumbent
senator, and his margins of victory have eroded in each of the last
two elections. With a growing number of registered Democrats in the
district, party officials say that this year offers the best
prospect to defeat Goodman. He has overcome Democratic majorities
before, but the ratio has grown to more than 2-to-1, with 52
percent registered as Democrats and 23 percent as Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats running in the Sept. 12 primary have
distinctly different backgrounds. One is Liz Krueger, who is on
leave from the Community Food Resource Center, an organization she
has run for several years. The other is Robert J. Bellinson, a
lawyer who has run against Goodman in the last two elections.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates emphasize some of the same issues. Both talk
about the need to increase spending on public schools in the
district and to build a Second Avenue subway. They both favor more
affordable housing and better access to health care.
</P>
<P>
   Their most prominent disagreement is about who would be the
stronger challenger to Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Bellinson asserts that he is better positioned to defeat Goodman
because his previous challenges broadened his name recognition
among voters in the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who beat incumbents are not the people who come up
and run for the first time,'' Bellinson said. ``The way to beat an
incumbent is by running, getting your name known and having people
feel comfortable enough with you that they can accept the fact that
it is time for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Krueger, 42, said she would be a stronger challenger because she
had ``a much broader base of support.'' She also raised ``the
question of viability,'' noting Bellinson's two previous losses to
Goodman. ``We can't find anyone else in New York history who has
run and won on the third time against the same candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellinson, 35, describes himself as a former all-star softball
player who was once a lawyer for the Transit Police Benevolent
Association. He calls himself a fiscally conservative Democrat who
supports abortion rights, gun control legislation and changes in
campaign finance laws. He is a lawyer with a private practice in
the district, he said, often representing small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger's first job in New York was organizing a food bank in
the South Bronx, and she has been involved with antipoverty
organizations ever since. She has presented herself to voters as an
expert on government financing of food and housing for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to shake up Albany,'' she said. ``We need affordable
housing _ even here on the East Side. And I want to help people who
are frustrated with the educational system and with the health care
system. I know I can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan's 26th District includes some of the city's wealthiest
areas. It runs from East 14th Street to East 97th Street, generally
from the East River to Fifth Avenue and east of Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two, Krueger has made far greater headway in
fund-raising. She has collected about $300,000 for her campaign.
Bellinson, who has so far raised about $75,000, has made Krueger's
fund-raising a central theme of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has raised a quarter of a million dollars from her mommy
and daddy's friends,'' Bellinson said. ``I think that is bad for
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Krueger disagreed. ``I am pleased that my support has been
extraordinarily broad,'' she said. ``How does anyone raise money?
It's through a combination of people they know and people who are
strangers. Do I know people because I've met them through my
family? I have, just as Mr. Bellinson has.''
</P>
<P>
   Krueger said she had challenged Bellinson to voluntarily operate
under guidelines similar to those recommended by the city's
Campaign Finance Board for candidates for municipal office. Those
guidelines would limit spending during the campaign. ``We have
never heard from him on that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bellinson, in response, said he had agreed to the limits.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: ATTRACTING NEW IMMIGRANTS TO THE HEARTLAND
</HEADLINE>
  By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 3: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iowa isn't a crowded place. It wasn't crowded when I was growing
up there in the 1950s and early 60s, and it isn't crowded now. In
1960, when I was in third grade, the state population was 2,757,537
and still slowly climbing, as it had been all century, until it
reached a peak of just less than three million people in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Yet things haven't been as static in Iowa as these figures
suggest. The way that Iowa isn't crowded has changed. The number of
third graders has plummeted, and the population as a whole has
gotten older. The percentage of the population over 80 is larger in
Iowa than in any other state. Iowa is the only state besides
Florida with more people over 75 than under 5.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the reasons the state _ which has nearly always
experienced annual net migration losses _ wants to encourage
immigration. A plan to do just that, produced by a bipartisan
governor's commission called the 2010 Committee, has caused an
uproar in a state that is overwhelmingly white. In fact, the
commission's report merely recognizes a demographic reality.
Without immigration, the state's labor force will steadily dwindle.
The only reason Iowa's population has not fallen further is because
of immigrants who have come from Mexico, Vietnam, Bosnia and
elsewhere. The greatest demand for labor comes from industries like
meat packing.
</P>
<P>
   The population problem in Iowa isn't merely that its residents
are getting old and its young people are leaving. The problem is
tied directly to the character of agriculture in the state. In 1960
there were 174,707 farms in Iowa, down from a peak of around
215,000 in 1930. Last year there were about 96,000 farms, though
the amount of farmland in cultivation had barely changed. There are
15 million hogs in Iowa, but they are raised on fewer than half as
many farms as just a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   It can be hard to grasp the implications of a shift that large.
Think of a farm, for a moment, not as a tract of land or so many
acres of corn and soybeans. Think of a farm instead as a
constellation of people, each of whom has ties to a local community
_ to churches and schools, to banks and farm-implement dealers, to
co-ops and Lions Clubs. In 1960, small towns were thriving not on
the prosperity of town residents alone but on the prosperity _ and
the population _ of farms in the adjoining countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Now half of those farms are gone, their groves cut down, their
houses bulldozed, their constellations of people dispersed. Year by
year, the size of farms increases and their work force diminishes.
The towns are very quiet, except the ones lucky enough to hear the
roar of enormous grain driers at the elevator out by the railroad
tracks. School districts have consolidated, and small-town business
is just a ghost of itself. It is not uncommon to come across a
sense of disinheritance among Iowans, especially those living in
small towns. The bond that tied them to the farmland around them _
a bond that was social as well as economic _ has to a striking
degree been severed. There is no one on the farms, and the towns
have no one to serve except their aging residents.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has come about because of a faith _ an unproved
faith _ that the only way for agriculture to prosper is for farms
to become bigger and bigger. There is no question that Iowa raises
vastly more corn and soybeans than it did in 1960. But at what
cost? Farm prices are as low as they have ever been, and farmers
now pray for emergency funding from Congress the way they pray for
rain. One of the indisputable results of large-scale corporate
farming in Iowa has been the depopulation of the countryside. An
agricultural job in Iowa is now a meat-packing job, highly
dangerous, badly paid and emblematic of an approach to farming that
will serve Iowa's new immigrants as badly as it has served its
longtime residents. &QL;

LAWYERS FOR ECUADOREANS SEE JUDGE LINKED TO TEXACO 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge had been considering for four years
whether to hear a lawsuit filed against Texaco by Ecuadorean
Indians who say the oil company polluted their lands. According to
federal judicial and tax documents obtained by the Indians'
lawyers, the judge attended an expenses-paid seminar on
environmental issues held by a foundation that received regular
donations from Texaco. A former chief executive of the company
spoke at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, saying there appeared to be a conflict of interest,
filed a motion on Friday with the judge, Jed S. Rakoff of U.S.
District Court in Manhattan, asking that he recuse himself and turn
the case over to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Clerks for Rakoff said his office could not comment on the
motion.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gidez, a spokesman for Texaco, said the company would not
comment other than to say, ``This is a matter for the court to
consider.'' He reiterated Texaco's stance that any lawsuit over
pollution in Ecuador should be heard in Ecuadorean courts.
</P>
<P>
   This is a position that Rakoff took three years ago when he
dismissed the case as having no basis in U.S. courts. That
dismissal was overruled by a federal appeals court, which sent the
case back to Rakoff in October 1998. It has been before him since
then with no new move to either dismiss it or take it to trial.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Bonifaz, one of the Indians' lawyers, said the potential
conflict for Rakoff lay not just in Texaco's financial support for
the organization that played host to the seminar, but also in those
who spoke.
</P>
<P>
   At the six-day event, held at a Montana ranch in September 1998,
one of the lecturers was Alfred C. DeCrane Jr., the retired
chairman and chief executive officer of Texaco, who ran the company
for part of the time it operated in Ecuador. From 1964 to 1990,
Texaco helped Ecuador's state-owned oil company, Petroecuador,
develop oil fields in the Amazon River basin.
</P>
<P>
   In the motion filed on Friday, the plaintiffs' lawyers said that
once Rakoff took up the case again, he should have told them he had
attended the seminar with the former Texaco executive.
</P>
<P>
   DeCrane's Montana lecture focused on an environmental cleanup at
a Texaco refinery in Texas, not on the Amazon, according to
representatives of the group running the seminar, the Foundation
for Research on Economics and the Environment.
</P>
<P>
   But Bonifaz said there would have been ample opportunity for
Rakoff and DeCrane to have informal discussions at the dinners,
hikes, fishing trips and other activities offered to participants,
all of whom were federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls on Friday to the home and office of DeCrane, who
is now a consultant, were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit against Texaco was filed in 1993 on behalf of
thousands of Indians and settlers in northern Ecuador, after a team
of scientists and doctors found extensive pollution of waters and
land around the oil fields developed in part by Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that Texaco failed to use cleanup methods
adopted by many other oil companies, and so was partly responsible
for the pollution and any subsequent health problems or
environmental damage. It demands, among other things, that the
company create a medical fund to help affected Indian tribes and
other residents of the area and that it initiate a comprehensive
cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco officials said the company had already paid $40 million
to Ecuador to help clean up pollution.

decades, the notion of government and business nurturing its strong

cotton there. ``My grandfather was proud of the fact that he owned
property. He used to say, `When you own a foot of land, you own
something.' `` Soon after arriving six years ago, Godfrey searched
for his grandparents' graves at Oxford's only cemetery. ``I

   OUTBACK _ Keyed to the opening of the Summer Olympics (9/15):
The vast majority of the Australian continent is nothing like
Sydney or Melbourne. It's an arid, sparsely populated moonscape
that the world knows as the Outback. The spiritual heart of it is
called the Red Centre, after the red sand that ripples under the
hot wind. We journey into the region aboard the Ghan train, kick
around the funky town of Alice Springs and make a pilgrimage to
Uluru, the great rust-colored mountain in the middle of the
continent that is sacred to Aborigines and iconic to all
Australians. (Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

normal childhood. Growing up is hard enough. Imagine having to do
it in front of millions of people watching your every move or
snickering about every goofy-looking pimple you get. The pressure
to perform is also insanely intense. Many adult actors can't even
take the heat and often resort to drugs and alcohol to cope. Just
think what it's like for a kid to overhear a producer angrily
talking about low ratings and possible cancellation. And in a
business where rejection is the norm, just what kind of toll does
that take on a child's psyche? (Thompson, Palm Beach Post). MOVED

 &HT;    Blacks furious as cemetery buy collapse

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ West Palm Beach's hopes of snaring a
state historic preservation grant have collapsed, stalling a
project that would transform a neglected and weed-infested mass
grave of the victims of the 1928 Hurricane into a $6 million
memorial park.
</P>
<P>
   City officials announced this week that no progress has been
made, after more than a year of trying to buy 1.4 acres that the
city sold in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dead for now,'' said Commissioner Mary Brandenburg. ``We
don't have any money in next year's budget.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't welcome news for Robert Hazard, the executive
director of the Storm of '28 Memorial Park Coalition Inc., who has
worked with the city for more than a year in trying to officially
memorialize the mass grave. The grave holds at least 674 victims _
mostly black migrant workers _ who perished in Belle Glade during
the 1928 hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of West Palm Beach is carrying its apathy and
disgrace, that has racism at its origin and the blatant disrespect
for the black community as its motivation, into a new century,''
Hazard said in a letter Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Brandenburg and City Administrator Ed Mitchell said the city
withdrew the historic preservation application after learning it
was incomplete. Missing from the application was an independent
appraisal of the property, an agreement with the owner of the
property that he will sell the land, and documentation that the
city will match the $115,000 grant.
</P>
<P>
   The application was filled out by former mayoral aide Derrick
Woody, who was leaving for a job in Washington, D.C., the week
before it was due. No one else reviewed the application before he
turned it in. Woody couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the application had been complete, there's doubt it
would have met the criteria to win any money, said Robert Taylor, a
historic preservationist supervisor with the Florida Department of
State who had reviewed it.
</P>
<P>
   Grants usually are awarded to projects that aim to preserve
historical structures, not for projects needing to buy land for
something that hasn't been built yet, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the city should find the money to simply buy it
back,'' Taylor said. ``It seems like they shouldn't have let this
happen in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he had never seen a cemetery's history quite like
this one.
</P>
<P>
   The Storm of '28 raked across Florida, killing more than 1,800
people who lived in communities around Lake Okeechobee. The ground
was so saturated after the storm, however, that bodies had to be
taken east and buried in mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   At least 674 bodies that were identified as black, or couldn't
be identified, were taken to a pauper's cemetery. They were stacked
two to three layers deep.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, the city built a sewage plant on property next to the
cemetery. In 1964, 25th Street was built over a portion of the mass
grave. In 1984, the city sold the land to Union Missionary Baptist
Church.
</P>
<P>
   During a series of real estate sales in the 1980s, the fact that
bodies were buried at the site was never revealed to the buyers _
despite a strong oral history in the neighborhoods nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The present owner, Jim Kolkana, bought the land in 1993 for
$230,000. With the bodies making the property difficult to develop,
the market value of the land, according to one appraisal, was
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Brandenburg said she favors looking for more grants that could
help the city buy the land, which Kolkana has listed at $230,000.
But commissioners on Monday said they were reluctant to pay that
much for the land, even with help from grants.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Joel Daves said he's considering taking the land by
eminent domain, in which a jury would decide a fair price for the
property.
</P>
<P>
   But that would take time, and patience is running out for many
who have been involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has fallen apart,'' said Bennie Herring, who
stopped working as a consultant to the coalition in May. ``The
conspiracy that has allowed this tragic chapter in our city's
history to last for 72 years appears to continue.''

NEW PASSER ANSWERS QUESTIONS FOR IRISH
</HEADLINE>
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ The coach wondered how his quarterback would
react if he got off tentatively in his first start as quarterback
for Notre Dame. ``What happens when something goes wrong,'' Coach
Bob Davie wondered the other day. ``Just how resilient is he going
to be?''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the third quarter Saturday, Arnaz Battle gave his answer
to the coach who is fighting for his job and to the 80,232 people
at Notre Dame Stadium who could tolerate smothering 90-plus degree
heat but not another humiliating 5-7 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Fighting Irish were behind by 3 points to No. 25 Texas A&AMP;M
after Terence Kitchens booted a 23-yard field goal, capping a
75-yard drive that took up half of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the game, Battle looked like a quarterback who threw
just 35 passes in two seasons as a backup. He hit receivers on
their rumps with ill-timed tosses, scampered into sacks and looked
like nerves _ not the 108-degree temperatures _ were wilting him..
</P>
<P>
   But with the Irish trailing by 10-7 and stalled on Aggies'
46-yard line, Battle glided right as if he was going to run. Then,
he stopped and heaved a pass to Javin Hunter, who was streaking
down the right sideline. When the junior split end leaped across
the end zone line to snag the pass, Battle was halfway there to
meet him _ it was his first touchdown pass at Notre Dame and it
gave the Irish its first lead and paved the way for an impressive
24-10 thumping of the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   If that didn't answer the questions about Battle, the 12-play,
69-yard touchdown drive that followed did. On 3rd and 19, Battle
threaded a 21-yard pass to flanker David Givens deep in the A&AMP;M
secondary, which allowed Julius Jones to blow 22 yards down the
field for a 21-10 lead. One more time, he moved the Irish 49-yards
to set up a 32-yard field goal by Nick Setta.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback had plenty of help as Notre Dame won the
statistical battle over Texas A&AMP;M: The Irish outgained them by 327
yards to 255, including a 194-90 advantage on the ground. But it
was Battle (10 of 16 for 133 yards and 2 touchdowns, 12 rushes for
50-yards) who showed Notre Dame the way to a much needed victory.
</P>
<P>
   The 25th-ranked Aggies were stymied for much of the first half
by what looked like an improved Irish defensive unit with many of
the same players that gave up a generous 383.7 yards a game last
season. Texas A&AMP;M managed just 136 yards in the first half, but
still scored first by outpowering the Irish on two critical
third-down situations on an eight-play, 46-yard drive to open the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On third down and 9 at the Irish 34-yard line, Texas A&AMP;M
quarterback Mark Farris sprinted back as if he were going to pass,
then deftly handed the ball to the freshman running back Richard
Whitaker on the draw. The 5-foot 10-inch, 197-pounder was 10 yards
deep in the secondary before the Irish noticed and brought him down
on the 15-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies went to the same play and the same man again after
sputtering inside the 10-yard line. On third down and 4 from the
8-yard line, Farris tucked the ball in Whitaker's belly and he
rolled into the end zone untouched for the first score of his
collegiate career. When Terence Kitchens converted the extra point,
the Aggies had a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But after wasting field position and committing drive-killing
penalties for the first 26 minutes of the 2000 season, the Irish
attack, behind Battle, finally executed the option offense with
precision. For much of the half Battle looked haunted in the pocket
under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But with 3:40 left in the half, Battle gathered himself and
displayed all his talents in a flawless 70-yard march down the
field in an economical seven plays. First, he threw a dart to
fullback Tom Lopienski in the flat for an 18-yard gain, followed
that with an 11-yard dash around right end on the option and then
picked up 6 more the other way on the same play. With the swift
Aggie linebackers keying on him, he gave it to Lopienski for a
pile-pushing 7-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   Then, under pressure, Battle scrambled to the right side and
found Lopienski again in the flat for a 16-yard gain down to the
Aggies' 12-yard line. Two plays later, Battle faked a hand-off to
Fisher and, upright in the pocket, lobbed a soft pass over the
outside shoulder of Joey Getherall, who had beaten cornerback Jay
Brooks in the back of the end zone. When Nick Setta kicked the
extra point, the Irish went into the locker room tied at 7-7. &QL;

 &HT;    THOUSANDS CONVERGE ON ROME FOR BEATIFICATION OF CHAMINADE
 &HT;    BY BERT ROUGHTON JR.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Sitting on the cooling marble steps of some ancient
building, Mary Margaret Toohey was
</P>
<P>
   taking a break Saturday from the hot work of being a pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   Toohey at 87 _ she'll be 88 next week _ is the oldest among a
group from Dayton, Ohio, here to honor Father William Joseph
Chaminade, the founder of the Marianist Order. They are joining
many as 7,000 fellow
</P>
<P>
   Marianists who have come from around the world to celebrate
Chaminade's beatification Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, they marched for two hours down the streets of Rome
_ often forced onto a sidewalk by
</P>
<P>
   the honking, whizzing traffic _ under cloudless blue skies. At
designated intervals they would pause to say
</P>
<P>
   a prayer, and remember something about Chaminade's life or
preachings.
</P>
<P>
   Taking in the magnificent architecture during one of these
breaks, Toohey expressed no desire to be
</P>
<P>
   spared the rest of the hot march. ``I'm holding up just fine,''
she said, her bright green-blue eyes confirming
</P>
<P>
   this assessment.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, she gave every impression of relishing every
dusty step _ a sentiment shared by
</P>
<P>
   her fellow travelers from Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Marianist throng are about 125 Daytonians, many of
whom have some connection with the
</P>
<P>
   University of Dayton, the largest Marianist institution of
higher learning in America. About 30 among the
</P>
<P>
   Dayton contingent are students. There are other Americans, many
from Cincinnati and Texas, but the
</P>
<P>
   Dayton group is considered the largest from a single city.
</P>
<P>
   Most have come as part tourist, part pilgrim. But in Rome it is
easy to blend the two. Many arrived a
</P>
<P>
   day or two before the official observances and have taken in the
Sistine Chapel, St. Peter's Cathedral and
</P>
<P>
   other sites.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, they will join the sea of humanity at St. Peter's
Square for Chaminade' beatification,
</P>
<P>
   which will place the 19th century priest and namesake for
Dayton's Chaminade High School one step from
</P>
<P>
   sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 200,000 pilgrims will be in the massive square for
the beatification of Pope John XXIII, one
</P>
<P>
   of the church's most popular popes. Also to be beatified Sunday
by Pope John Paul is Pius IX, a controversial
</P>
<P>
   and ultra-conservative 19th century pope accused of
anti-Semitism. Demonstrators on Saturday denounced
</P>
<P>
   the decision.
</P>
<P>
   But the other beatification candidates were hardly mentioned by
the Marianists, distinctive in their
</P>
<P>
   blue scarves tied maybe a hundred different ways to show their
support of Chaminade.
</P>
<P>
   Among those expected to be in the crowd Sunday is the woman from
Argentina who reported the
</P>
<P>
   miraculous vanishing of a tumor in her thyroid. The Roman
Catholic Church late last year accepted this as
</P>
<P>
   Chaminade's requisite miracle, setting the stage for Sunday's
beatification.
</P>
<P>
   Chaminade, a priest who was persecuted during the French
Revolution, founded the Marianists, a
</P>
<P>
   religious order credited with the reviving Christianity in
post-revolutionary France. The Society of Mary
</P>
<P>
   was established in the United States in 1849 in Dayton and
Marianists have a strong presence in the city,
</P>
<P>
   most notably at the university.
</P>
<P>
   For many in the Dayton group, the experience of the march and a
two-hour prayer vigil represented a
</P>
<P>
   dramatic moment of understanding the scope of their order. The
event was the largest ever held of
</P>
<P>
   Marianists
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance for us is the sense that you suddenly find
out that he's famous around the world,'' said
</P>
<P>
   Father Eugene Contadina.

<P>
   Una Cadegan, who teaches history at the University of Dayton,
said she was astounded by the diversity of the crowd. ``I was
impressed most by the enormity of what we are all about,'' she said
as the crowd was making its way out from the schoolyard where the
vigil was held. ``It's one thing to read the statistics about where
everyone comes from, but it's something else to actually see so
many people from so many places _ so many
</P>
<P>
   languages. I really felt it here, here in my stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilgrims have come from 34 countries representing all
continents and many ethnic groups, said
</P>
<P>
   Donald Boccardi, a Marianist and director of the office of
spiritual renewal in the Marianist province of
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati. Boccardi also serves on a nine-member international
panel that has worked for Chaminade's
</P>
<P>
   beatification.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the prayer vigil took so long was that it was
given in four languages _ Italian, Spanish,
</P>
<P>
   French and then English. The service was opened with a
procession of African Marianists.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Henderson, who oversees diversity programs at UD, was
perhaps the only non-Catholic
</P>
<P>
   among the pilgrims. She also was impressed with the mix of the
crowd. ``This isn't much like what you
</P>
<P>
   would see at a Catholic church back home,'' she said. ``It shows
you the real power of diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   For Monalisa Mullins, the experience has had a special
importance. She became a Roman Catholic at
</P>
<P>
   Easter, and believes the freshness of her decision has helped
her see the pilgrimage in a new light.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first cast eyes on St. Peter's, it was a very spiritual
experience,'' she said. ``It was very
</P>
<P>
   meaningful to me. It felt as if I needed to be here _ as if I
had come all this way just to have that
</P>
<P>
   experience.''

SENIORS BRISTLE AT DRIVER AGE BIAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DENNIS McCARTHY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAN NUYS, Calif. _ The parking lot was almost full at the San
Fernando Valley's most popular seniors' hangout, officially the
Organization for the Needs of the Elderly. Everybody just calls it
ONE.
</P>
<P>
   It is here at two North Los Angeles locations - in Reseda and
Van Nuys - that more than 400 seniors from all over the Valley come
every day to mingle, take some classes and break a little bread
together.
</P>
<P>
   The men usually hang out with the men, the women with the women,
but there is one thing they always share every morning.
</P>
<P>
   That parking lot for their cars.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't count their grandkids and Social Security checks,
one of the most important things in their lives is that car parked
outside, a lot of these seniors say.
</P>
<P>
   It's their lifeline to continued independence.
</P>
<P>
   We may take that car for granted most of our lives, but when you
retire and those-not-so-golden years come, you take nothing for
granted, including your ability to get around.
</P>
<P>
   That's why so many seniors were upset Thursday morning over at
Leo Maggio's ONE Straight Talk class at the Valley Senior Service &AMP;
Resource Center. It's happening again, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Senior bashing.
</P>
<P>
   The topic getting some straight talk was front-page news. A
91-year-old man, Val Conrad of Sylmar, had killed a 1-year-old boy
and injured three other people when he accidentally hit the gas
pedal on his car instead of the brake and drove through the front
door of a bank.
</P>
<P>
   The tragic incident put the spotlight back on a hot-button issue
in this country: Should there be stricter rules and guidelines for
driving a car when people get older and their reflexes slow down?
</P>
<P>
   Even in Leo's class of all seniors in their 70s and 80s, you
can't get a straight answer on this one, but you do get a lot of
questions that need to be answered.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is, Why should senior citizens as a group bear the
brunt of criticism when one in their ranks is involved in a tragic
accident like this?
</P>
<P>
   Do we yell about severely curtailing the driving rights of all
teen-agers, or adults driving with a cell phone stuck in their ear
when one in their ranks screws up?
</P>
<P>
   Do we tell mothers who get distracted by their children while
driving, and have an accident that they can't drive with children
in the car anymore?
</P>
<P>
   Nope, we just tell them to be more careful next time. With
seniors, we start screaming: ``Age!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's discrimination to pick on one group because somebody in
it has had an accident like this,'' said Trudy Gollub, as Izzy
Silverstein nodded his head vigorously in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't judge people by the group they are in,'' Izzy says.
``I'm in my 80s and still driving OK, even with a woman in the
car.''
</P>
<P>
   The line draws a guarded laugh because there is nothing really
funny about senior drivers getting bashed again, these people say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the individual, not age, whether he or she
should be driving or not,'' says Toby Cummins. ``Some people are
old at 60, some are young at 80. I've had friends who have given up
their licenses when they thought it was time.''
</P>
<P>
   But giving up your driver's license is one of the hardest
decisions a senior will ever have to make, these people say. They
will fight it to the bitter end.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are basically being asked to give up your independence,
too, and no one wants to do that,'' says Clare Karish, who like all
the others thinks public transportation in the Valley stinks
because it is too unreliable and slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when the time comes, I will give up my driver's license,''
Clare said.
</P>
<P>
   But who should choose that time? Seniors themselves? Their
families? Their doctors? The Department of Motor Vehicles? They
can't agree, although they think the counsel of family and doctors
is important.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing they can agree on is that men are more
stubborn than women in realizing when that time has come.
</P>
<P>
   Leo admits that over the years he has had to follow some of the
men in his class home because he was worried about their medical
condition to drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched them drive over curbs and cross the double yellow
lines,'' Leo said. ``I've had to tell their wives that it was time
to get their husbands to give up their licenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Greenstein said he was speaking with some young people
recently who thought old people drove too slowly, a common
complaint. He seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe older people should have a limited license,'' Harry
said.
</P>
<P>
   The others disagreed, vehemently. If young people think older
drivers go to slow, maybe the state should turn the diamond lane
into the senior lane, a few of them said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   One thing everyone agreed on though. Whatever happens next, it
has to cut across all age groups, not just senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same should hold true for young people and everyone
else,'' Clare said. ``If they're reckless, we should get on their
backs, like everyone's getting on ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Just bashing the seniors again isn't the answer.

FBC-USC-MCCULLOUGH -- For a couple of decades, it seemed as if the
man atop the Heisman Trophy was modeled after the Trojans'
tailback. Now, the Trojans of 2000 have a tailback who might carry
them along with the ball. He is Sultan McCullough, a sophomore from
Pasadena, Calif., who rushed 29 times for 128 yards last Sunday
when USC opened its season with a 29-5 victory over Penn State in
the Kickoff Classic at Giants Stadium. (Vincent Laforet/The New

   (NYT19) NEW YORK -- Sept. 2, 2000 -- TEN-USOPEN-3 -- Lisa
Raymond, the world's top-ranked doubles player, recently lost an
arbitration case that would have put her on the U.S. Olympic tennis
team instead of Serena Williams. She was determined to prove on the
tennis court that the U.S. Tennis Association had made a mistake by
leaving her home. But on Saturday, Raymond ran into the powerful
groundstrokes of fourth-seeded Mary Pierce at the U.S. Open, who
prevailed 6-4, 7-6 (6). Raymond during her match against Pierce,

-- died on Aug. 17 at his home in Alexandria, Va. He was 87. The
son of an admiral, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and a
combat veteran of two wars, Bowen was steeped in Navy traditions,
foremost among them: ``Don't give up the ship.'' Admiral Bowen in

   (NYT6) EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Sept. 2, 2000 -- FBN-JETS -- The
New York Jets' regular season begins Sunday against Green Bay at
Lambeau Field, but the restiveness that accompanied an off-season
of extraordinary tumult, assured in some part by the trade of
receiver Keyshawn Johnson, may linger for a while. One of the
biggest questions that remains for the New York Jets is whether or
not Vinny Testaverde, after suffering a devastating Achilles'
injury last year, is healthy enough -- and young enough -- to
return to something approaching his 1998 form? (Vincent Laforet/The
New York Times)

<P>
   (NYT5) UNDATED -- Sept. 2, 2000 -- GORE-BIO -- Vice President Al
Gore had embarrassed himself by running for president before he was
ready, in early 1988. He shuttered that campaign, his first losing
effort, just as he was turning 40. In April 1989, he watched a car
hit his 6-year-old son. His therapy, his catharsis, his way of
making sense of all he had been through, was a writing project that
became the book ``Earth in the Balance,'' an environmental call to
arms. (The New York Times)

   (NYT4) ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Sept. 2, 2000 -- LEE-JUDGE-INTERVIEW
-- Judge James A. Parker, who is presiding in the Wen Ho Lee case.
Parker, 63, describes himself as a conservative Republican; indeed,
he was appointed to the bench in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan.
Parker has made it clear that he is quite comfortable making even
unpopular decisions if he feels they are supported by a strict
reading of the law. And that is why, he says, he has not hesitated
in issuing a string of bold decisions in Lee's national security
case. Parker in chambers in Albuquerque, N.M. (Steve Northup/The

   (NYT3) CORINTH, Vt. -- Sept. 2, 2000 -- VERMONT-BACKLASH --
Signs in Vermont are usually sweet: ``Maple Syrup,'' ``Farm Fresh
Eggs,'' ``Country Crafts.'' But a recent cause of anger throughout
Vermont is the civil unions law allowing gay couples be joined in
marriagelike civil unions. And from editorial pages to country
roads, this campaign-season fight is getting nasty. Carol Appleton,
a mother of four and a dairy farmer, says she painted Take Back
Vermont in giant letters across her roadside barn because of ``the
way the government takes more control.'' (Paul O. Boisvert/The New

   (NYT2) SEATTLE -- Sept. 2, 2000 -- LIEBERMAN-CLINTON -- Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate,
center, was the first Democrat in the Senate to chastise President
Bill Clinton for his sexual misbehavior. In the weeks since his
nomination, Lieberman has made it clear that he feels far freer
than Vice President Al Gore to embrace the president and claim
bragging rights to the achievements of his administration. At rally
in Seattle last week, Lieberman acknowledges a familiar face in the
crowd. At right, Senate colleague Sen. Patty Murray. At left, is

   (NYT1) MONTPELIER, Vt. -- Sept. 2, 2000 -- PRINCIPALS-SHORTAGE
-- Four years ago, at 63, James King retired as the principal of a
middle school in central Vermont to become a sports announcer, a
dream he had harbored since the Korean War. But soon after his
debut on a local radio station, King was lured out of the booth and
flooded with offers to serve as a temporary principal at schools
around this state. In Calais, a small town east of Montpelier, Vt.,
King, now 67, met with his staff last week before beginning his new
job as principal of Calais Elementary School. (Paul O. Boisvert/The

 &HT;    Burtons going for a sweep
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ Ward and Jeff Burton have been coming to the
Southern 500 since their parents brought them to Darlington Raceway
as children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to camp near the track and attend the races there with
my father, brothers and friends when I was younger,'' Ward said.
``It is a very special track, one with a lot of history and one of
the last of its type left on our circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burton brothers have created their own history at ``The
Track Too Tough To Tame'' during the past two seasons. Jeff
captured both of the rain-shortened events in 1999. Ward, who won
the Mall.com 400 in March, will go for another Burton sweep in
today's 1 p.m. race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the main thing is we just need to stay real focused
and get a competitive finish out of it,'' Ward said. ``Whether
we're going to have the car to win or not, we've got 450 miles to
get to that point and then we'll decide like we do every week at
the end of the race.''
</P>
<P>
   MB2 Motorsports, which is owned by three Georgia residents, is
enjoying its best race weekend of the season. The team's drivers,
Johnny Benson and Ken Schrader, qualified second and eighth,
respectively. ``Kenny Schrader, (our two crew chiefs) and myself
have been doing a tremendous job of communicating back and forth,''
Johnny Benson said. ``We're getting our cars as equal as
possible.''

FRENCH SHRUG OFF STRIKE, BUT BRITONS LODGE A PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. MALO, France _ Like thousands of Francophiles, Maggie
Chilton came here to spend the last two weeks of August pursuing
favorite French pastimes, from sunning herself along the Brittany
coast to walking to the nearby boulangerie and patisserie to buy a
baguette.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sour end to a glorious vacation, she and thousands of
other foreigners became hostage to another French pastime: the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen demanding lower fuel prices blockaded five French
ports, including this historic harbor whence pirates once raided
British ships, an old occurrence that some say has morphed into
what is now called a job action.
</P>
<P>
   Chilton was furious. Her return ferry to Britain was canceled on
Wednesday, and she was forced to load her elderly parents into a
car and drive across northern France in search of a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   As for the strikers, many of them men with young families to
take care of, she was adamant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've lost my sympathy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dix, the British manager of Eurotunnel, which runs the
Chunnel linking Dover with Calais, shrugged when asked how a few
hundred fishermen could hold thousands of foreigners hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is relatively normal in France,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it is. By some estimates, there are as many as 10,000
strikes and street protests in France every year. Newspapers
routinely publish advice on how to avoid the protests by any number
of aggrieved parties that can shut down parts of Paris at any given
time.
</P>
<P>
   French farmers and truckers are especially strike-prone. The
farmers might dump rotten fruit or vegetables into the street,
demanding more subsidies. The truckers might use their rigs as
roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, truckers brought the country to a standstill, demanding
the right to retire at 55. They got it, which might explain why
some fishermen used a similar tactic last week, blocking the
departure and arrival of ferries that link France and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   After two days, the fishermen prevailed. The government,
embarrassed by the blockade and the publicity, agreed to a
reduction in the fuel tax for fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   The British government is demanding that the French take a
tougher stand against strikers. The deputy prime minister, John
Prescott, said the port blockade was a blatant violation of the law
that guarantees free travel through the 15-member European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The British protests are likely to fall on deaf ears.The French
take their right to take to the streets, or, in this case, the
seas, very seriously, and despite the inconvenience caused by
strikes, the French public overwhelmingly supports le droit a la
greve, the right to strike.
</P>
<P>
   From the French Revolution of 1789 through the student revolt of
1968, which inspired many of Europe's current socialist leaders,
France has a protest tradition that is part of the national psyche.
</P>
<P>
   That's no comfort to David Wallis, a Londoner who, like
thousands of other visitors, scrambled to make contingency plans to
find shelter for his wife and two young sons in case the strike
dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French are holding British people hostage over a petty
dispute that has nothing to do with us,'' he said. ``They are not
holding their own people hostage, just us. And they are doing it
because they can get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right, by and large. Dix said the Channel tunnel routinely
suffers the rage of French truckers and farmers and others who use
it to make a point of protest because the penalties for public
disruption in France are minimal, and are seldom enforced. British
businesses have mostly given up trying to recoup their losses from
French strikes. The process is long, arduous, and hardly worth the
effort, according to many British business people.
</P>
<P>
   French politicians have trod lightly on demands to reduce the
number of strikes, or at least to minimize their inconvenience to
the public. A few years ago, President Jacques Chirac, whose
Gaullist party, the Rally for the Republic, enjoys the support of
the business leaders who routinely lose millions of francs to
strikes, gingerly suggested reining in strikers.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialist-led government attacked him, saying he was
striking at the very heart of egalitarianism, a concept that is
engraved on French currency, if not in the French consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Like everywhere else in the industrialized world, union
membership in France has dropped dramatically over the past
generation, to the point where it is now less than 10 percent. But
the public transportation unions still wield enormous clout, and
are able to shut down the country at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Peters, head of P&AMP;O Stena, a ferry line that lost money and
that had thousands of furious stranded travelers on its hands for
much of last week, said the European Union must stand up to the
French propensity to strike. He said that if the EU could ban
duty-free purchases on the grounds that they violated the EU's free
trade zone, the Brussels-based alliance could ban strikes that deny
European Union citizens free movement across national borders in
the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
   A grizzled fisherman who was tending to his boat on a pier next
to this walled city's famous ramparts wasn't impressed by Peters'
idea. The fisherman noted that the European Parliament sits in
Strasbourg, France, for a month every year. In a bizarre
compromise, the EU agreed to spend billions of dollars to build a
sparkling parliament building so the EU government could be moved
there for a month each year.
</P>
<P>
   And if the rest of the EU had refused to go to Strasbourg?
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have gone on strike,'' the fisherman said with a
smile.

 &HT;    Gambill, Henin offer no mercy
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anna Kournikova is beginning to show signs of aging
while Jan-Michael Gambill is emerging as the young men's player to
watch at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th-seeded Kournikova lost to 18-year-old Justine Henin of
Belgium 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) Saturday. Henin is the fourth player younger
than Kournikova to beat her in the past five months.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill upset 1998 U.S. Open runner-up Mark Philippoussis 6-4,
6-4, 6-4, outgunning the Aussie Scud at the service line 17 aces to
16. Gambill, 23, is two wins from the quarterfinals with no top-80
players in his path.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sampras, Lindsay Davenport and Serena Williams won easily
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   There was no shame for Kournikova in losing to the 66th-ranked
Henin, a rising star who won the French juniors at age 15. Going
one-handed off both sides, Henin hit 26 winners to Kournikova's 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed that when I was aggressive, when I went to the net,
when I attacked, I was better than her,'' Henin said.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that Kournikova, once lumped in with the Williams
sisters and Martina Hingis as one of the young guns, is losing
ground to a new class of young movers.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova, 19, has lost to 18-year-olds Henin, Jelena Dokic and
Kim Clijsters in recent months, in addition to Serena Williams, and
she hasn't advanced past the fourth round of a major since her run
to the semifinals in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill, ranked 27th, is doing much better with the burden of
``Next Great American.'' He's 19-6 since the French Open and is
proving he's one of the tour's most dangerous hardcourt players.
</P>
<P>
   Even against the powerful Philippoussis, Gambill stood toe to
toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit my groundstrokes just as hard as he does,'' Gambill
said. ``He's hitting his serve maybe 5, 7, 10 miles an hour faster,
but I'm hitting just as many aces. It was really going to be who is
going to return better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambill was 3 of 7 on break points, Philippoussis 0-for-7.

CLINTON VISITS THE STATE FAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton and her husband climbed
atop a counter at Gianelli's Sausage stand at the New York State
Fair here on Saturday and, with dozens of cameras clicking and
whirling, consumed two huge, gloppy sausage sandwiches, loaded with
onions, peppers and barbecue sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' Mrs. Clinton pronounced, her voice muffled by
the sandwich she was eating, as she swayed to country music blaring
over tinny loudspeakers. President Clinton took a moment from his
very obvious enjoyment of his sandwich to wipe his wife's mouth
with a napkin.
</P>
<P>
   This, though, was more than just another photo opportunity being
staged by a twice-elected president and a first-time Senate
candidate who have come to appreciate the photographic advantages
offered by a state fair. Mrs. Clinton's meal came a week after her
opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, demurred at the same state fair when a
reporter from a Syracuse newspaper asked whether he enjoyed sausage
sandwiches, one of the favorite foodstuffs at this annual fair.
Lazio, acknowledging that they were not among his favorites, did
not eat one.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raiser Saturday afternoon, Clinton made an explicit,
if slightly exaggerated, reference to Lazio's sausage encounter.
``After the other candidate for Senate refused to eat a sausage
sandwich there, this one did not,'' Mr. Clinton said to roars of
laughter from a partisan crowd. A spokesman for Lazio, Brian Flood,
responded Saturday evening: ``Growing up in New York, with a name
like Lazio, I'm sure our candidate is a bit more acquainted with
sausages, not to mention peppers and onions, than Mrs. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's visit was the Clintons' second to the state fair,
and, like last summer, they found huge and enthusiastic crowds.
Visitors stood six-deep on a humid, overcast afternoon, waiting for
hours, presumably to see a president since Mrs. Clinton (and for
that matter, Lazio) never draws crowds anywhere near this large.
Both the president and Mrs. Clinton enjoyed the friendly reception,
going to opposite sides of the road and shaking every hand in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look great in peach!'' one women cried, remarking on the
color of Mrs. Clinton's pantsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Hogan, a burly security guard in front of the sausage
stand, sidled up to the Clintons for a picture, and then whispered
to Mrs. Clinton: ``You've got my vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit to the state fair consumed most of what was supposed
to be a day of relaxation. From here, Mrs. Clinton was heading for
a second fund-raiser. When a reporter asked her if this was a
``real vacation,'' she paused for a long moment, widened her eyes
and said: ``Sort of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons spent the night in Skaneateles, where homeowners
scattered their front lawns along the Clinton motorcade route with
signs bearing the names of both Senate candidates. An unscientific
survey suggested an edge for Lazio; this is a Republican part of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   At the sausage stand, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton clowned around a bit.
The president tied a bandana around his own neck, and then
proceeded to tie one around his wife's as well. ``Don't pull it too
tight,'' she instructed her husband.

 &HT;    Mack's campaign getting boost from high places
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Steve Abrams was cruising along, thinking his
campaign for a seat in the Florida legislature was on the right
track. Then he got a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person said there was good news and bad news,'' the
veteran Boca Raton councilman remembers. ``The good news was that a
32-year-old fellow was entering the race, and he had no community
involvement, had only lived in the district for a few years, he
doesn't vote, and he works for Hooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is he is Connie Mack the Fourth.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, who had already raised more than $80,000, weighed the
options and took what he thought was the sensible route: He dropped
out.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Connie Mack, an effective Republican in the U.S.
Senate, is retiring and passing on his political machinery, not to
mention his well-known name, to his only son, a young man with a
penchant for public scuffles with strangers, a bachelor's degree in
advertising that took 7 1/2 years to obtain, and a habit of not
taking the time to vote _ even when his father was making a bid for
reelection six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the younger Connie Mack faces his first election, as
one of the two Republican candidates in the primary for Florida
House District 91.
</P>
<P>
   He goes into Tuesday's primary with one of the best political
consultants in the business, a name that will conjure up images of
his dad and a steady stream of willing contributors who have
already kicked in nearly $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of money is unprecedented. It's rolling in out of
respect for his father,'' said contributor Ron Book, a Miami-based
lobbyist and former money guy for Bob Graham's gubernatorial
campaign. ``By electing Connie Mack, they're electing somebody who
will start out at an advantage more than any other freshman. He
will come in as a leader and be rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   A leader? He hasn't even been a follower, according to Lynn
Spinella Pagans, the only challenger who wasn't scared off by
Mack's late bid for the seat, which became vacant due to term
limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been active in the local party since 1992 and active in
my community for the past 19 years, and I didn't know him,'' said
Spinella Pagans, 37, a financial adviser and former city
councilwoman.
</P>
<P>
   But everybody knows his father.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vince DeGennaro, a surgeon who is president of the Broward
County Medical Society, was, like Abrams, another former candidate
in Mack's race. DeGennaro has long ties with the community and some
expertise on the issue of health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could bring to the table a perspective that wasn't
there,'' he said. ``Twenty-five to 30 percent of the bills that the
legislature talks about are health-care related,'' DeGennaro said.
``I thought I would be useful. I thought I'd serve a couple of
terms, then get out.''
</P>
<P>
   But he found it pointless to run against the younger Mack.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the primary, people will be voting for him, thinking it's
his father,'' DeGennaro said. ``That's the reality of it.''
</P>
<P>
   RESUME IS SHORT AND FUZZY
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable that voters might not even know there is a
younger Connie Mack.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Mack's political ascendancy has been sharp and
recent. And his resume, short and fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   Born Cornelius H. McGillicuddy, the younger Mack attended public
high school in Northern Virginia, transferring in the middle of his
junior year to the Massanutten Military School in Woodstock, Va.
</P>
<P>
   He left the military high school a year later in January of
1986, lacking an English credit to graduate, and finished his high
school requirement by enrolling that month at Sante Fe Community
College in Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 2 1/2 years at the community college and transferred to
the University of Florida in May of 1988. He graduated from the
university five years later, and three months shy of his 26th
birthday, with a bachelor's degree in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   His battles, during those days, were not political in nature.
</P>
<P>
   From 1987 to 1992, Mack was involved in four physical
confrontations with strangers _ one ending in his arrest, another
in a civil lawsuit he filed.
</P>
<P>
   In the earliest case, Mack was attending a friend's wedding in
1987 and was with his friends in a car waiting at a drawbridge in
West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy in the back of the car was imitating (comedian) Howie
Mandel . . . he has this weird scream that he does . . . and the
guy next to us thought that we were yelling at him,'' Mack later
explained in a court statement in another case. ``Then he got out
of his car. I got out of the car. There was a little altercation.
We got into a fist fight, and the drawbridge came up, I got in my
car, left, and he filed a report. Assault and battery or something
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   No charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Mack's car windows were smashed with a baseball
bat during a confrontation with another motorist in Cape Coral.
Mack said he decided not to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Mack and a friend went to a Jacksonville nightclub
called Bananas, and according to employees there, refused to comply
with the no-hats rule at the bar. Mack got into a scuffle with an
off-duty police officer, who arrested him for resisting arrest,
without violence.
</P>
<P>
   FOUGHT WITH BASEBALL PLAYER
</P>
<P>
   Mack pleaded no contest, paid $100 and had the court records
sealed. But this episode, as well as the previous two fights, came
to light when Mack got into a very public bar fight with Atlanta
Braves baseball player Ron Gant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, the great-grandson of legendary baseball manager Connie
Mack, had no idea that the guy in the bar was one of the game's
stars. After the fight, a friend told Mack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should know more about baseball, but I didn't know,'' Mack
testified in a court statement. ``All I said was, `Who is Ronnie
Gant?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gant was nobody to tangle with in a bar fight. Although he's a
physically unimposing 5-foot-9, Gant has the upper body of a
stevedore. He had just come off a season when he finished third in
the National League in home runs (32) and second in extra base
hits. On top of that, Gant is a brown belt in Tae Kwon Do.
</P>
<P>
   The fight started when Mack bumped Gant at Calico Jack's, a
crowded Atlanta-area nightclub. Mack, who had been drinking beer
and tequila, was filling out his credit-card receipt when he bumped
Gant three times without apologizing, according to the ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy never said `excuse me' or anything,'' Gant said.
</P>
<P>
   The ballplayer said he finally pushed Mack away from him, and
then, to his surprise, Mack lowered his head and bull-rushed Gant.
Mack says he didn't charge. He was just tossed back into Gant by
people in the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Gant had Mack in a headlock, and Mack had Gant by the testicles
when bouncers and the ballplayer's friend joined the scuffle,
knocking Mack to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bouncers proceeded to whale on him,'' Gant said.
</P>
<P>
   Mack ended up with a broken ankle. No charges were filed, and
after the scuffle, Mack and Gant talked briefly outside the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said something like, `What happened in there was wrong,' and
he says, `Well, you know, these things happen.' And that was really
it,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't. Mack sued Gant for his injury, and the case went
to trial three years ago in Cobb County, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found Gant responsible for Mack's broken ankle, but
awarded Mack no money.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Duggan, the jury foreman, explained why.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the case of two people acting stupid,'' Duggan said.
``There shouldn't have been a lawsuit to begin with. Mack got his
leg hurt, but it was his fault.''
</P>
<P>
   HOOTERS NOT MENTIONED
</P>
<P>
   After college, Mack got a job with the Miami Hooters arena
football team, selling advertising sponsorships. After the team
folded, Mack stayed on, working for LTP Management, the owner of
more than a dozen Hooters restaurants in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connie heads up a variety of different marketing functions,''
said his boss, Champ Regnier, the vice president of marketing at
LTP. ``He's got a good personality. He's very inspirational.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack's campaign material, which features photos of Mack with
children, makes no mention of Hooters, a restaurant chain that
features scantily-clad waitresses who wear uniforms of short-shorts
and tight-fitting T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   It simply calls him a ``marketing executive.'' And when he
announced his candidacy in November, he mentioned his ``broad
business experience'' _ surely an unintentional pun.
</P>
<P>
   Mack is a special events coordinator for Hooters.
</P>
<P>
   For example, last year he was listed as the East Coast (Florida)
Hooters contact for a Special Olympics promotion by the restaurant,
in which Hooters Girls ran alongside Special Olympics athletes on a
route that began at one Hooters restaurant and ended at another.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, he got married. He and his wife, Ann, had their
first child this year. And this summer, he attended the Republican
National Convention, the first time he had done that since high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Neutral political observers say Mack's sudden rise from
non-voter to vote seeker with a credible organization can be
attributed to his father's enormous political capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked at the donations,'' said Randy Nielsen, the
political consultant for Ken Pruitt's bid for a state Senate seat.
``It's all (senator) Connie Mack people. He's got Team Mack working
for him. It's a consulting stable any other consultant would
admire. The heavy artillery has moved in.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Mack's chief political consultant is Arthur
Finkelstein, the take-no-prisoners conservative Republican
equivalent of James Carville. Finkelstein's clients have included
Ronald Reagan and former senators Lauch Faircloth and Alfonse
D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   And although Finkelstein is gay and Jewish, he has masterminded
a Jesse Helms campaign in which Helms attacked his opponent by
accusing homosexuals of ``buying the election,'' and Finkelstein
ran another campaign in South Carolina that polled voters by
referring to his client's opponent as ``a foreign-born Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Finkelstein was also the mastermind of former Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's surprisingly successful 1996 campaign
against Shimon Peres, who was shown in attack ads walking with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat with the tagline: ``A dangerous
combination for Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Mack is getting a lot more help from high places.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Republican Party of Florida doesn't endorse
candidates during primaries, the statewide party is lining up with
the younger Mack.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGNING DOOR-TO-DOOR
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Wilson, the executive director of the Republican Party of
Florida, is a former staffer of the older Mack and openly supports
his son.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said about a dozen state legislators have already gone to
Mack's district to campaign for him door-to-door.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be able to hold your own to gain the support of
the state legislature,'' Wilson said. ``He's got great political
instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack's campaign is paying Wilson's wife, Judy, as a financial
consultant. The state party executive director's wife has already
received more than $46,000 from the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to the district, Mack has help from some other deep
pockets with ties to his father. Collecting money for the younger
Mack are Jorge Arrizurieta, a vice president in H. Wayne Huizenga's
organization, and Paul Anderson, an executive with JM Family
Enterprises of Deerfield Beach, the huge Toyota distributor. JM
Family Enterprises is one of Florida's biggest soft-money donors to
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Mack has raised most of his campaign money from
outside the voting district, with many big businesses chipping in
(Coca-Cola, gambling, sugar mills, Pratt &AMP; Whitney), as well as
some well-known Washington chums of his father, including Sens.
Trent Lott and Mitch McConnell, former vice presidential nominee
Jack Kemp and President George Bush's White House counsel, C.
Boyden Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Mack's money is already more than triple the amount of money the
average successful state House candidate raised during the 1998
election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute on Money in State Politics tallied the
contributions for Florida races two years ago, determining that
winning candidates for state House races raised about $125,000,
while unsuccessful candidates raised an average of about $58,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mack's opponent, Spinella Pagans, has raised about $25,000 and
is using the large disparity in the financing as a campaign ad. The
ad portrays the younger Mack as a hamburger called ``Little Mack''
that is waving and saying, ``Don't hold the `lettuce!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The windfall of cash for the younger Mack is most likely a
reflection of the father, not the son, University of Florida
political science professor Richard Scher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a farewell present to his father,'' Scher said. ``It's as
if they're going to give his dad a present by getting his son
elected. Senator Mack has served Florida very, very well, and this
is his reward for doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrizurieta downplayed the senator's influence in the son's
campaign and said too much is being made of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be penalized because you have a visible, popular father is
a great tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arrizurieta sees the younger Mack as a viable candidate on his
own merits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a successful fund-raiser because people believe
in him,'' Arrizurieta said. ``He's been a successful professional.
Just because he hasn't served elsewhere is irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   VOTED TWICE IN SIX YEARS
</P>
<P>
   Mack has voted only twice in the past six years, and while
``smarter schools'' is his first campaign pledge, he failed to vote
three years ago in an election about the fate of the school board
in his home county.
</P>
<P>
   His appearances before the editorial boards of the region's
three major newspapers failed to land him a single endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Mack has said he is concentrating on getting elected first, then
he'll work on the specifics. In his brief and increasingly scarce
public appearances, he sticks to a script of generalities about
smart schools and safe streets and a cleaner environment.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, through his campaign manager, declined to be interviewed
for this article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connie Mack recognizes that the liberal establishment,
including The Palm Beach Post, is promoting a philosophical agenda
for its own special interest,'' a typed message from the campaign
manager said. ``They are making no attempt at objectivity and
therefore nothing furthered can be gained by an interview at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent mailing, his campaign has also blasted his opponent
_ active in the party since she was president of the Young
Republicans at Florida State University _ for being the candidate
of liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County political consultant Daryl Glenney, who is
leaving the business this year after 27 years, is not involved in
Mack's race. But she said campaigns like his make her want to find
another line of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just tired of this kind of stuff,'' she said. ``The
downside of democracy is that anybody with some money can wake up
one morning and say, 'I look like a congressman' and then throw out
enough money and get elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a frustration that good people get into these races _
and then get snowed under.''

FULLMER ENJOYING TIME IN TORONTO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Brad Fullmer doesn't mince words when it comes
to his displeasure with the Montreal Expos. The season he is having
since being traded from the Expos this spring is an indication of
what the Montclair Prep graduate can do when he likes his
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting two home runs in Wednesday's series finale against
the Anaheim Angels - giving him 28 for the season, more than double
his previous season high - the Toronto Blue Jays designated hitter
entered this weekend's series against Oakland with a .298 batting
average and 90 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like getting released from a prison sentence to
get out of where I was at,'' Fullmer said. ``So I got paroled and
now things are good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having my best year and we've got a chance to make the
playoffs, so what more could you ask?''
</P>
<P>
   Not much, according to the Blue Jays, whose coaches say Fullmer
is one of the team's hardest workers and most open-minded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's no problem, no problem at all,'' Toronto batting coach
Cito Gaston said. ``He's a good student, he's good to work with.
Him and I can talk during the game about making some adjustments on
how they're trying to pitch him. It's worked out real well.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullmer began to fall out of favor with Montreal early last year
when he refused to alter his approach at the plate, which resulted
in a demotion to Triple-A in May. He was recalled in June, but sent
back two days later. The tension increased when he initially
refused to play in the minors because he said he had a knee injury,
but doctors couldn't find anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Trade rumors surfaced, but when nothing happened for months,
Fullmer figured he was in for another long season with the Expos.
However, a three-way deal involving the Texas Rangers gave Fullmer
a fresh start in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled,'' Fullmer said. ``Just to get out of there was
great.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to the American League also means Fullmer would be a
designated hitter instead of playing first base, a position where
he made 17 errors in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston remembers Fullmer asking what a designated hitter does to
keep busy, but now the coach finds himself having to tell Fullmer
to stop. Fullmer frequently leaves the dugout during games to hit
off a tee, but he starts over with even one bad swing near the end
of his routine
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we do have to talk about is him working too hard
sometimes,'' Gaston said. ``Sometimes he takes too many swings, so
I have to keep him from swinging too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really complain about someone wanting to work that
hard, though. If you work hard, you put up numbers like that.
That's why he's put up numbers, he works hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullmer is pretty sure he wouldn't be doing as well if he stayed
in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to dwell on what happened with that other
situation,'' Fullmer said. ``Because there are some good things,
like I got an opportunity to get to the big leagues at 22. ... But
things kind of turned in a direction I wasn't happy with last year.
So for me, it's a much better situation here. That's a big part of
having success on the field. If you're happy and things are going
the way you'd like them to go. I'm happy now.''

   CAMPAIGN (Kansas City, Mo.) _ So, just how hot is it this Labor
Day? It's so hot in the Missouri governor's race, you could fry an
egg on a voting machine. It's so hot, you get second-degree burns
just touching the press releases in Missouri's U.S. Senate
election. It's so hot, George W. Bush's lead in the polls
evaporated faster than the water in his backyard birdbath. The
sizzle is all around us this season. By Steve Kraske. Story will

   FORFEITURE (Sacramento, Calif.) _ Just a week ago a forfeiture
reform bill moving through the California legislature would have
created the nation's toughest law regulating the way police handle
drug money they seize. By the time the bill passed _ by just two
votes in the last hours of the session _ the reforms it offered
were strong but more modest. And in that, experts say, other states
such as Kansas and Missouri that will soon eye their own reforms
can draw two lessons: Never underestimate the power of the law
enforcement lobby. It is possible to pass tougher forfeiture laws.

<P>
   COMMUNE (Rutledge, Mo.) _ Since spring, at least for post
mistress Mary Walker, tiny Rutledge in far northeast Missouri could
pass for a miniature Amazon.com. From the small post office here,
thousands of copies of a book are being mailed out across the
country. Not a little book either. Drop the volume on a toe and
likely it'll bruise. Nearly three pounds can do that. ``It's been
thousands of books,'' said Walker. ``It's a lot of our business.''
The book is the third edition of /{ Communities Directory /}, a
slick, 457-page tome on communal living profiling what used to be
called hippie communes. Now, however, they're called ``intentional
communities.'' By Jim Fisher. Story will move in the ``a''

<P>
   MISERS (Kansas City, Mo.) _ Well into her 90s, Lucille Lucas had
a simple financial goal. And she sure knew how to save toward it.
She stayed in a $34,000 home with a sagging roof in Wyandotte
County, Kan., rather than buying something nicer. She slept naked
on her back porch during hot summer nights rather than buying an
air conditioner. For meals, she took a free bus to eat free lunches
at a nearby seniors complex. Or she ordered a fast-food burger with
extra lettuce and tomato, then kept the garnish for dinner. All
this so when Lucas finally passed away last Christmas Day, she
could achieve her goal and leave several charities much of what she
had squirreled away _ a couple of million dollars. Millionaires
like Lucas are popping up all over the country. And their estates
or portfolios are becoming a bonanza for philanthropy. By Jeffrey
Spivak. Story will move in the ``a'' category.

COWBOYS TO UNVEIL NEW OFFENSE, BUT EAGLES POSE DIFFICULT FIRST
TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ For the Cowboys' Jack Reilly offense, today is
sort of Easter Sunday, prom night and the debutante ball rolled
into one.
</P>
<P>
   Break out the digital cameras. Make sure the aunts and uncles
are here. Today's game is the Cowboys' 41st season opener (Texas
Stadium, 3:05 p.m.), and it comes against longtime NFC East nemesis
Philadelphia, which led the NFL last season in takeaways and would
like nothing more than to unnerve a new offense in its first game.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason alone, Troy Aikman has warned us: This
first-year timing-route offense of the Cowboys, at times, might
appear awkward today.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, it will be just plain ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially when you're playing a team with Philadelphia's
style of defense. ... They're going to come after us,'' said
Aikman, who is 12-10 lifetime against the Eagles. ``In games like
this, there'll be some ugly plays, \Rbut\S then you've also got to
try to take advantage of some of the chances they give you.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman will throw to Joey Galloway, James McKnight and Jackie
Harris for the first time in the regular season, so consistency
could be more difficult to achieve against these eager Eagles than
scoring a few big plays.
</P>
<P>
   It's only Sept. 3, but the names Galloway, Rocket Ismail,
McKnight, Harris, Emmitt Smith, even Chris Warren lined up in the
slot, won't come as any surprise to Eagles defensive coordinator
Jim Johnson. The Cowboys, instead, must count on the ``overload''
theory: Make it so the Eagles can't possibly cover everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is an offense based on getting the ball into the
hands \Rof players\S who can win the football game for you,'' said
Dave Campo, who makes his regular-season head-coaching debut at any
level. ``We'll have a priority list, and we'll get the ball to the
guys on that list.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``defensive coordinator'' inside Campo likes two qualities
in particular found in Reilley's portfolio:
</P>
<P>
   His ability to package an offense to utilize players' strengths
in different groups.
</P>
<P>
   His unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   Said Aikman: ``I think right now teams have to kind of decide
how they want to play us. I don't think defenses are going to just
let Joey run downfield on them. They're going to pay attention to
him, and then it's up to the other players to help us when that
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Galloway, who also is expected to return punts in certain
situations today, said that he feels comfortable in the offense, in
sync with Aikman and oblivious to any outside pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real big on pressure,'' Galloway said. ``I don't know
that I really pay attention to what people outside this locker room
expect from me. So, therefore, I don't notice whether there's more
or less pressure on me. I just know that I have a job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If Galloway draws two-deep-zone coverage to his side, with a
cornerback backed by a safety, then Ismail, on the other side,
should be single-covered. In theory, this leaves the middle of the
field open for Harris or either of the other Cowboys' tight ends _
David LaFleur and newly acquired O.J. Santiago _ while also
discouraging the Eagles from playing an eight-man front to stop
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Eagles disguise their coverages and employ zone
blitzes, often bringing eight defenders; other times, they bring
pressure but drop off a defensive lineman and create a delusion
that there are more rushers than blockers to pick them up.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who missed all five preseason games because of injuries
(left big toe/right calf), has all of his front-line blockers in
place now that right tackle Erik Williams has returned from a
28-day holdout. Solomon Page, whom the Cowboys see as their right
tackle of the future, will make his seventh NFL start but only his
first regular-season start at right guard.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chan Gailey, the Cowboys took few shots downfield in the
passing game and repeatedly stalled in the red zone (25 touchdowns
in 48 trips) last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a team looks at us this year, I think they would have to
say that we have the ability to make some plays throwing the
football,'' Aikman said. ``They may stack eight \Rdefenders\S on
the line of scrimmage and challenge us, but I don't know if they
want to do that too many times.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Aikman added, ``It'll be a real chess game for the
coordinators.''
</P>
<P>
   A chess game that roughly 64,000 fans at Texas Stadium will
fully expect Jack Reilly to win.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Bush briefed on secrets by CIA
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service Gov. George W. Bush received a CIA
<TEXT>
briefing at his secluded ranch retreat in Crawford, Texas, on
Saturday. He called the four hour briefing an important part of
preparing for the White House, and added: ``I've got a good chance
to win the election.'' The tradition of briefing nominees dates
from the 1952 campaign, when Harry S. Truman saw to it that his
would-be successors did not come to office as he did _ when as vice
president he succeeded Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945 _ without
knowledge of his own administration's intelligence secrets, even
the atomic bomb project.
<P>
   GORE UP BY 10 POINTS, POLL SHOWS
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has a 10-point lead over Bush, according
to a Newsweek poll of nationwide voters released Friday. In the
poll, Democrat Gore had 49 percent, Republican Bush had 39 percent,
Green Party candidate Ralph Nader had 3 percent and Reform Party
candidate Pat Buchanan had 1 percent. The two leading candidates
were in a dead heat a week ago in this poll.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in an Iowa Poll sponsored by the Des Moines Register,
Gore led Bush 45 percent to 37 percent, after trailing there
earlier in the year. In a Vermont poll by Mason Dixon, Gore led
Bush 49 percent to 36 percent. The new polls continue a full week
of Gore gains in the race.
</P>
<P>
   GORE IS A LOOKER; BUSH IS FUNNIER, POLL FINDS
</P>
<P>
   Although a recent presidential preference poll by Gallup found
that Bush and Gore were virtually tied, 46 percent for Bush and 45
percent for Gore, the poll also found that voters think Gore is
smarter and better looking, but that Bush is a better speaker and
has a better sense of humor. Roughly two out of every three women
said Gore was the most handsome. Men generally agreed, though two
out of five insisted they had no opinion. Most men also said Bush
was the better speaker. The poll of 1,019 adults has a 3 percent
margin of error.

   JUDGE RULES BUCHANAN CAN STAY ON BALLOT
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court James Ford in Sacramento, Calif., on Friday
denied an attempt by opponents of Pat Buchanan to withdraw his name
as the Reform Party presidential nominee. Opponents wanted
Buchanan's name replaced with that of John Hagelin, who was
nominated as the party's presidential candidate in a splinter
convention last month.
</P>
<P>
   FOSTER'S RECORDS NOT SEALED
</P>
<P>
   A judge on Friday declined a request to seal the workers'
compensation records of Reform Party vice presidential candidate
Ezola Foster but allowed her attorneys time to appeal his decision
before making the records public. Foster, Buchanan's running mate,
filed a claim in 1996 for disability payments based on a mental
health condition that she has refused to disclose. She filed the
claim shortly after leaving her job as a high school typing
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN ON HOME TURF
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since he was nominated for vice president at
the Democratic National Convention, Sen. Joseph Lieberman returned
home to Connecticut on Friday, saying ``I almost got off the plane
and kissed the ground because there is no place like home.''
Lieberman also said he had no plans to drop out of the race for his
Senate seat while pursuing the vice presidency. He suggested a
special election next year to pick his replacement if he wins both
the Senate race and the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH AND GORE TO APPEAR ON OPRAH
</P>
<P>
   Bush has agreed to appear on a live interview with talk-show
host Oprah Winfrey on Sept. 18 _ a week after Gore makes a similar
appearance. Gore will be a guest on the show Sept. 11, which kicks
off Winfrey's 15th season.

LITTLE-KNOWN MILLIONAIRES CHANGING THE FACE OF PHILANTHROPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Well into her 90s,
Lucille Lucas had a simple financial goal. And she sure knew how to
save toward it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucas stayed in a $34,000 home with a sagging roof in Wyandotte
County, Kan., rather than buy something nicer. She slept naked on
her back porch on hot summer nights rather than buy an air
conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   For meals she took a free bus to eat free lunches at a nearby
seniors complex. Or she ordered a fast-food burger with extra
lettuce and tomato, and then kept the garnish for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   All this so that when Lucas died last Christmas Day she could
achieve her goal and leave charities much of what she had
squirreled away _ a couple of million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Millionaires like Lucas are popping up all over the country.
They live frugally and save voraciously. Thanks to the long-lasting
robust economy, the number of millionaires has doubled since the
mid-1990s. And their estates or portfolios are becoming a bonanza
for philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Charitable gifts of at least $1 million have increased fourfold
since the mid-1980s, according to Indiana University's Center on
Philanthropy. Among gifts of at least $5 million, the value of
donations has doubled since 1996, according to the Urban
Institute's Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   These gifts are going toward all kinds of causes. In the Kansas
City area, wealthy unknowns have helped set fund-raising records
for the American Heart Association, balanced the budget of the
American Lung Association of Western Missouri and accounted for
almost all new accounts at the Greater Kansas City Community
Foundation and Affiliated Trusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more and more millionaires that no one knows
about,'' said John Havens, associate director of Social Welfare
Research Institute at Boston College. ``They're changing the face
of charity.'' Frugal living
</P>
<P>
   Last year one of Lucas' distant relatives, Gordon Brown, came to
visit her. He found a house stacked with boxes of her late
husband's papers and possessions, leaving just narrow paths through
the rooms. There was no food except for some crackers, and the
bathtub was full of cold, dirty water, which Lucas reused for her
baths.
</P>
<P>
   Stock certificates and dividend checks were lying everywhere.
Lucas would not let Brown clean up much, because the checks, worth
thousands, remained uncashed, and she did not want them thrown away
accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every day, Lucas telephoned her stockbroker. She did not
want any bank taking over her finances, because banks closed
earlier than her broker's office and, as she told an attorney, ``an
hour of possible investment time would be wasted each day.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas was born in 1906, grew up in Bonner Springs, Kan., married
and moved to the Detroit area, and then returned to the family
house. Along the way, she found fun in investing and ended up
owning thousand of shares of blue-chip stocks in such companies as
AT&AMP;T, ExxonMobil, Chrysler and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found her to be a most intelligent, educated, pleasant,
quite stubborn woman of 94 years of age,'' an attorney wrote after
a relative petitioned the Wyandotte County District Court to
appoint a guardian for Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows much about folks like Lucas who hide their wealth
behind modest homes and eccentric habits. There are no definitive
studies about their charitable inclinations. But there are studies
of millionaires as a group.
</P>
<P>
   The Spectrem Group, a New York-based market research firm,
estimates households worth at least $1 million _ from stocks,
valuables and ownerships of small businesses, but not homes _ more
than doubled since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are more millionaires than ever, nearly 7 million
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthy drive philanthropy, thanks in part to a federal
estate tax. To tap this wealth, nearly every major institution or
charity has beefed up development offices or created planned-giving
departments. In the past they focused on specific stereotypes, such
as widowed and childless Mission Hills women.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, most donations come from people the charity staffs
never heard of. For every major gift the American Heart Association
successfully solicits, for instance, five or more come from the
inconspicuous rich, said Ken Sutherland, director of planned giving
for a six-state Midwest region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard profile is being exploded,'' said Mark Litzler,
executive director of the Truman Medical Center Charitable
Foundation and last year's president of the Greater Kansas City
Council on Philanthropy. ``There are more people capable of making
a major gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Inconspicuous wealth
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes these people shock their communities upon their
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Gordon Elwood in Medford, Ore. Elwood went to a food
bank for handouts, but he left a $10 million fortune last fall to
the town's social-service agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Schieber of New York City was an IRS auditor who wore the
same frayed black dress to work every day and then bequeathed $22
million to a university a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, an area woman stayed in the same house she and her
husband built in 1937 and so feared another Great Depression that
she hid silver dollars in shoe boxes and under sinks. Three years
ago her estate endowed a $20 million fund at the Greater Kansas
City Community Foundation, which has become a home for funds set up
by wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Many more people like them are still alive. Nathan Sutton, a
Johnson County, Kan., estate planner, sees them every week. They
have built small businesses or invested in real estate or, more
recently, cashed out stock options at Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are the millionaire next door,'' said Sutton, who
handled Lucas' will. ``They have a moderate-size house, and once in
a while I'll see somebody splurge, like buying a Porsche, but
that's to reward themselves once in their lives, and that's not the
way they've lived.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been increased interest in the minds and mores of
millionaires in recent years. Academics like Thomas Stanley, think
tanks and banks have surveyed thousands of them.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley found that the typical millionaire was a married man in
his mid-50s with three children, self-made and self-employed in an
obscure field with a median income of $131,000 and whose wife
clipped coupons.
</P>
<P>
   The key to building wealth, Stanley and William Danko wrote in
1996's The Millionaire Next Door, was simple: ``Being frugal.''
</P>
<P>
   `A gift from God'
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful that Lucas read that book. But she lived by its
creed. Saving hamburger lettuce, reusing bath water and not fixing
her house _ she did it all for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted her money to solve medical mysteries,'' said Terra
Morehead, an assistant Wyandotte County district attorney who
eventually was appointed Lucas' local guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' mother had died of a stroke. Her sister had died of heart
disease. Her brother-in-law had Alzheimer's disease. And she had
eye problems.
</P>
<P>
   So Lucas set aside her money accordingly _ $400,000 to the
American Heart Association, $100,000 toward an Alzheimer's center
at the University of Kansas Medical Center, $200,000 to a Johns
Hopkins University eye institute, and similar sums to other
institutions, $1 million total, all for research. The rest of her
small fortune is going to distant relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' estate still is in the probate process, so the money has
not been released yet. When it is, the $100,000 for the American
Lung Association of Western Missouri will become one of that
organization's top gifts of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing more and more of this, and we are very
grateful,'' said Joe Gilman, the association's interim executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's analogous to a gift from God.'' &QL;

POLITICAL CLIMATE PROMISES TO BE A SCORCHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ So, just how hot is
it this Labor Day weekend?
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's so hot in the Missouri governor's race, you could fry an
egg on a voting machine.
</P>
<P>
   It's so hot, you would get second-degree burns just touching the
press releases in Missouri's U.S. Senate election.
</P>
<P>
   It's so hot, Texas Gov. George W. Bush's lead in the polls
evaporated faster than water in a Lubbock birdbath.
</P>
<P>
   The sizzle is all around us this season.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the question is whether the Republican majority
in the House of Representatives will melt away. And some of the
best thermometers are right here in the congressional contests in
the Kansas suburbs and the Northland counties.
</P>
<P>
   In Jefferson City, Mo., the Democrats, who have long controlled
the Senate, are feeling a similar scorch on their necks. The
statewide races for lieutenant governor, secretary of state,
treasurer _ all sweaty close.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are clearly the most competitive races we've seen in a
long time,'' said Sen. Kit Bond, a Missouri Republican. ``There's
more at stake than there's been for years in Missouri politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just in Missouri, of course. Burning issues go beyond how to
pay for new Missouri roads or whether to try school vouchers or who
gets to redraw district lines for the next decade's elections.
Voters also will be asked to decide whether taxes should finance
state campaigns and whether it is time to cut down on the
proliferation of billboards.
</P>
<P>
   Broader questions will touch us all: What to do with the budget
surplus? How will new appointments affect the delicate balance on
the U.S. Supreme Court? Will the elderly be able to afford their
pills? Can we build or afford a missile-defense system?
</P>
<P>
   Although many candidates set a blistering pace months _ even
years _ ago, Labor Day weekend marks the point at which everyone
goes full throttle. This real political season remains, at least,
the time when elections and politics get new life as a topic over
backyard fences and office water coolers.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, known as the nation's most reliable bellwether and a
perennial battleground state, will be very much on the minds of
Democratic Vice President Al Gore and Republican Bush. Only once in
the 20th century did the state go with a presidential loser _ Adlai
Stevenson in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Another historical footnote: Whoever was ahead in the national
polls at Labor Day has won the presidential election every time
since Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan were neck-and-neck in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   What do the pollsters say today? Gallup gave Bush a one-point
lead in the last week of August. On Friday, Newsweek said Gore was
up by 10. Next week? Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Missouri's U.S. Senate race pitting Republican
incumbent and former Gov. John Ashcroft against current Gov. Mel
Carnahan. They disagree on issues ranging from abortion to gun
control to patients' rights. Both men are nothing if not durable.
Ashcroft has won five statewide races, Carnahan four.
</P>
<P>
   With Carnahan stepping down after two terms, the position of
chief executive is open. Seeking to fill the void, in what has been
described as the nation's best governor's race, are state Treasurer
Bob Holden, a Democrat from Springfield, and Republican U.S. Rep.
Jim Talent from the St. Louis suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the city slicker running against the person from the
boondocks,'' said Ken Warren, a St. Louis University political
scientist. ``What makes it interesting is the tightness of the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Talent gave up his safe 2nd District seat, U.S. Rep.
Richard Gephardt's eyes lighted up next door. He is the House
minority leader. He wants to be speaker and sees a chance this
year. Republicans hold a 223-210 edge, the narrowest majority since
1955.
</P>
<P>
   With only 65 politicking days left, Republicans see some chances
to ring up successes, too.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas' most closely watched contest is its 3rd District
congressional race. Rep. Dennis Moore is seeking to become the
first Democrat in 64 years to win re-election. The district
includes Johnson and Wyandotte counties.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic U.S. Rep. Pat Danner is retiring from her 6th
District seat, which covers northwest Missouri and includes the
part of Kansas City north of the Missouri River. Her son, Steve,
hopes to keep the office in the family. Speaker of the House Dennis
Hastert, who has a lot to lose, has visited the district once,
trying to help Republican Sam Graves move in.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri voters also will have to sort through an unusually
competitive array of down-ballot races for lieutenant governor,
treasurer and secretary of state. Only the attorney general's race
features a heavy favorite. Democratic incumbent Jay Nixon is
seeking a third term against the largely unknown Sam Jones, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go to the top of the ballot to the bottom, and we see
interesting, competitive, well-funded races,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   The election also will determine which party controls the
Missouri General Assembly. The Democrats have been in charge for
half a century, but now the GOP is scratching at the door.
</P>
<P>
   One key race is the 31st Senate district just south of Kansas
City. Democrat Harold Caskey has held the seat since 1977 and faces
a major challenge from Republican state Rep. Jim Howerton of
Chilhowee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are more confident of hanging on to the House, which
they control 86-75. But down by only two seats in the state Senate,
many Republicans say the upper chamber is their best chance at
gaining a rare majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Bond said, ``is a watershed year.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are always high in a presidential year, but they're
especially significant this fall because, as Larry Sabato,
University of Virginia political scientist, said, ``in one vote
people will help to shape all branches of government for the next
10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 50 states must redraw its statehouse and
congressional districts in accordance with new census population
shifts. The party that wins the governor's office and controls the
legislature will have a distinct advantage in how the election maps
are shaped.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got the whole ball of wax,'' Sabato said. ``President,
both houses of Congress, Supreme Court, state legislatures and the
future through redistricting.'' &QL;

DIRECTORY PROFILES WHAT USED TO BE CALLED HIPPIE COMMUNES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   RUTLEDGE, Mo. _ Since spring, at least
for postmistress Mary Walker, tiny Rutledge in far northeast
Missouri could pass for a miniature Amazon.com.
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the small post office here, thousands of copies of a book
are being mailed out across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Not a little book either. Drop the volume on a toe and likely
it'll bruise. Nearly 3 pounds can do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been thousands of books,'' said Walker. ``It's a lot of
our business.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is the third edition of Communities Directory, a slick,
457-page tome on communal living profiling what used to be called
hippie communes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, they're called ``intentional communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember the psychedelic school buses, the ponytails and beads,
the visionary artists, political activists, bohemians and beats,
all dropping out and tuning in?
</P>
<P>
   Communities Directory, published by one intentional community
near here, is a sort of Official Airline Guide, Amtrak timetable
and Russell's Official National Motor Coach Guide to an American
subculture that dropped off the radar screen years ago.
</P>
<P>
   How many such communities are there now in Kansas? Three. In
Missouri, 20. There are 600-plus such places around the nation,
ranging from single homes in an urban setting to several hundred
acres of farmland.
</P>
<P>
   One commmunity emphasizes clowning. Nine are devoted to
anarchism. Others focus on bed and breakfast, feminism, energy
alternatives, human rights, group marriage, self-sufficiency, even
visions.
</P>
<P>
   Add an additional 375 topics and Communities Directory is
all-embracing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dropped `commune' several years ago,'' said Laird Schaub, a
founding member of the Sandhill Farm community here 25 years ago
and executive secretary of the Fellowship for Intentional
Community, the publisher of the book. The book was written by
several community members around the country. ``It didn't fit
anymore. You know, commune conjured up all sorts of images _ sex,
drugs, and rock and roll. A lot has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change, said Schaub, is that the number of such
communities has been growing since the early 1990s after being flat
during the 1980s. When the first edition of the book came out in
1990, there were 325 listings. By the mid-1990s and the second
edition, that number was up to 540.
</P>
<P>
   The new edition has 600-plus listings, and that ``doesn't begin
to cover what's going on,'' said Schaub. ``In our database we have
another 1,100 communities that have asked not to be listed. We
honor that.''
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance to be listed, said Schaub, stems from several
reasons _ a desire to keep a low profile, a certain lifestyle that
might make more conservative neighbors edgy or radical political
beliefs. He added that the book did not list cults or groups that
advocate violence.
</P>
<P>
   Schaub, 50, said the growth had been spurred by the flush
economy, a feeling by many young people that consumer materialism
was not an end in itself and the desire by some to experiment with
what they want to do with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   And more and more baby boomers in their 50s _ the teenagers and
twentysomethings in the 1960s and early 1970s _ are joining
communities, Schaub said.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Miller, a professor of religious studies at the University
of Kansas, agrees that many joining such groups are tired of what
they see as empty goals of modern-day life, the constant
acquisition of more material goods and the social climbing that
permeates the culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm seeing more than anything among young people,''
according to Miller, who said he spent two years in a commune in
his youth, ``is a strong environmental awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   The hot new sector of community living is called ``cohousing,''
in which a group builds several homes but forgoes individual
kitchen, eating and entertainment spaces, significantly lowering
costs. Those functions are carried out in a common house.
</P>
<P>
   Most communities have only a handful of residents, said Schaub,
but several have numbers in the hundreds. There probably are 10,000
people participating in intentional communities in the United
States, he estimated. That number swells when the 40,000-plus
Hutterian Brethren, who live mostly in Canada but have large
settlements in the upper Midwest, are added.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why one sees so few faces of color in intentional
communities, Schaub and Miller said that the barrios and the urban
cores still shared a sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   Schaub came to the community movement when he was 24. He has
been in north Missouri more than half his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to school in Minnesota,'' he said. ``What I really
loved about school was the togetherness we had there.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaub went off to Washington to work as a bureaucrat. He saved
his money. After two years, he went back to his college, found some
old friends and told them they had been the best part of his life.
Several felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was in the early '70s,'' Schaub said. ``We were
methodical. We got hold of some census data and found that the one
place in the Midwest that was losing people faster than any other
was southeast Iowa and northeast Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   After looking at a lot of land, the group bought 135 acres just
west of Rutledge near the old community of Sand Hill. The land and
vehicles would be owned jointly, the homes individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a clue what to do when we got here,'' said
Schaub. ``So we farmed. We started processing sorghum and selling
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The group also sells honey and mustard, and it gets the rest of
its income by selling a magazine and books on community living and
doing consulting work with other communities.
</P>
<P>
   The five members of Sandhill Farm get by on $60,000 annually,
enough so that members with children have been able to send them to
college, Schaub said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the book, Schaub said, the first two editions sold 18,000
copies each. He expects better sales for the new directory.
</P>
<P>
   Postmistress Walker says she couldn't be happier, even though it
means lugging considerable weight around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little post offices like ours always need the business just to
make sure we survive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Communities Directory is available for $34, postage paid, from
Sandhill Farm, Route 1, Box 156, Rutledge, MO 63563. &QL;

 POLICE FORFEITURE REFORM IN cALIFORNIA SEEN AS A GUIDE FOR ENTIRE (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Just a week ago a forfeiture-reform bill
moving through the California Legislature would have created the
nation's toughest law regulating the way police handle drug money
they seize.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the bill passed _ by just two votes in the last
hours of the session _ the reforms it offered were strong but more
modest.
</P>
<P>
   And in that, experts say, other states such as Kansas and
Missouri that will soon eye their own reforms can draw two lessons:
</P>
<P>
   - Law enforcement has a powerful lobby.
</P>
<P>
   - It is possible to pass tougher forfeiture laws.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the California bill still must be signed by Gov. Gray
Davis before becoming law, but already it has caught the eye of
lawmakers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will embolden other states,'' said Rep. Daniel Blue Jr. of
North Carolina, a past president of the National Conference of
State Legislators.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star published stories in the spring showing
that police throughout the country use federal law enforcement
agencies to evade state laws and keep drug money they seize.
</P>
<P>
   Police give the drug money to a federal agency, which keeps 20
percent or more and sends the rest back to the police department
that seized it.
</P>
<P>
   Most state laws, however, prohibit seized property from going
directly back to police.
</P>
<P>
   Many state legislators are concerned that if police profit from
fighting crime, they will be more aggressive in raising drug money
revenue, which could result in such problems as racial profiling
and illegal searches and seizures.
</P>
<P>
   State forfeiture laws also better protect civil liberties than
does federal law, which does not even require a charge to be filed
in order for property to be seized.
</P>
<P>
   Police say they need to retain much of the money they seize in
order to fight the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The California legislation would affect the way police handled
tens of millions of dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
   California law has allowed the seizing agency to keep about 50
percent, with the rest going to such purposes as drug education and
the state's general fund. Instead, police have regularly used
federal agencies, which return up to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In just three years the federal government has returned more
than $92 million to California law enforcement agencies, much of
that from drug cases initiated by the state agencies, according to
U.S. Department of Justice figures.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time, California would require police to
adhere to state laws rather than federal laws when seizing property
in drug cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislature here has spoken in a strong, bipartisan way,''
said Sen. John Vasconcellos, the Public Safety Committee Chairman
and a Santa Clara Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The most contentious provision, which attached a criminal
penalty to police agencies that evaded the law, was dropped last
week after overwhelming complaints by police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obnoxious to ask law enforcement to follow the law,''
said John Lovell, lobbyist for the California police chief's
association. ``That's insulting to every cop.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed Thursday would:
</P>
<P>
   - Require a judge rather than the law enforcement agency to
decide when drug money should be turned over to a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   - Define the point at which police have actually ``seized''
property. In Missouri, for example, police circumvent the state's
forfeiture law by arguing that they have not seized property but
are only holding it until a federal agency can take it. A bill is
pending to address that issue in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   - Require police officers to follow state law when seizing
property even if they are deputized by a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   - Allow the state attorney general to sue police agencies if
they violated the law. A long fight
</P>
<P>
   Forfeiture reform has been hard-fought in California.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers passed a bill in 1994, but it did not include a
provision forcing police to follow state law.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago Sen. John Burton, a San Francisco Democrat
and president pro tem, attempted to stop the flood of dollars to
the federal government with a bill requiring a judge's order to
transfer drug money to a federal agency. Law enforcement quickly
mounted pressure, and Burton realized he did not have the backing
of his colleagues at that time.
</P>
<P>
   When the current legislation was filed earlier this year by
Vasconcellos, there was little initial reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The bill quietly made its way through the Senate and the State
Assembly committees. It was not until the last two weeks of the
session that the effect of the bill became clear to police, who
went into action.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Yaryan, a lawyer who represents rank-and-file police in
Southern California, said the provision that made it a crime if a
police officer violated the law was like rubbing a pound of salt in
a wound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we're having police officers who are doing their job and
doing what they're told to do, and they would potentially be
criminals,'' Yaryan said. ``That's horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Police lobbyists told legislative staff that they would take the
fight to the governor and promised a veto unless the criminal
provision was removed.
</P>
<P>
   With such loud opposition from one of the state's most powerful
lobbies, that provision was discarded Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rand Martin, Vasconcellos' spokesman, said the law enforcement
lobby was perceived to be powerful, even though it did not have
much money at play in election campaigns. The lobby's power comes
more from politicians' fear that they could lose elections if they
are seen as soft on crime.
</P>
<P>
   So when law enforcement says to reject a bill, lawmakers tend to
listen, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On an issue like this, where (police) are fearful of losing
money, they turn up the heat more than they would normally,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even after the bill was changed and passed, Lovell vowed
that police would go to Davis, the governor. Some lobbyists and
legislators speculated that Davis, considered a friend of law
enforcement, would veto the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Salazar, a Davis spokesman, said the governor had not yet
decided. Reform push grows
</P>
<P>
   Legislators across the country think the California legislation
will have a big effect even if Davis vetoes it, because it shows
lawmakers can pass such laws despite the law enforcement lobby.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years few states have been successful in passing
reform legislation, but several are now considering it.
</P>
<P>
   Blue, of North Carolina, is closely watching developments
because, although his state laws require forfeited drug money to go
to public schools, little does.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bill was passed in California, the country's most
populous state, legislators elsewhere will look at it, Blue said.
</P>
<P>
   Blue said it was difficult politically for legislators to go
against law enforcement. Ultimately, he believes, Congress will
have to shoulder the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will probably have to fix it at the federal level,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One Utah legislator agreed that the California bill gave
momentum to other states, even if Davis were to exercise his veto
power.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Wright, an Elberta Republican and speaker pro tem,
said it was recognized that many governors often became ``friends
with the cops'' through the election process.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gain an association with them, and it becomes very
difficult to go against them,'' Wright said. ``A lot of (governors)
know it's right, but they just have a hard time standing up and
coming outside their loop.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah has a voter initiative on the November ballot that would
redirect money away from police to public schools and, like the
California law, require a judge's approval to transfer drug money
to a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors in Utah have joined forces to fight the
initiative, Wright said. Massachusetts and Oregon also have
initiatives aimed at reforming forfeiture laws.
</P>
<P>
   A forfeiture bill pending in Missouri failed in the spring
because of law enforcement pressure, but legislators hope to pass
it early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kreider, a Nixa Democrat and speaker pro tem, said law
enforcement was damaging itself by fighting reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to end up hurting them bad if it continues,'' said
Kreider, who is a co-sponsor of the bill. ``We don't want anything
to hurt our finest.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, Rep. Ralph Tanner, a Baldwin City Republican, praised
the California Legislature. Tanner has researched the California
bill as he is drafting one he plans to introduce in the next
session. He expects the bill to redirect drug money to education,
away from law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner is talking to legislators, seeking support. He realizes
that some, as in California, will believe police should have
everything they want.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner said he had hopes that because of what California and
Missouri had gone through, legislators in Kansas were awakening to
the idea that forfeiture reform had become necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Sen. Jim Costa, a Fresno Democrat and president
of the National Conference of State Legislators, said top
conference members would be meeting soon to determine their agenda
for the winter meeting in Washington. The forfeiture issue would be
considered because it affects so many states, he said. &QL;

'99 RAMS PROVE NFL'S LOST CAN BE FOUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to another NFL season of rampant confusion. Teams
coming. Teams going. The problem is, nobody knows anymore which is
which.
</P>
<P>
   It's like when your wife demands that you stop and ask
directions. You, of course, refuse. The manly thing to do is keep
driving. But an hour later, you've ended up in downtown St. Louis,
right in the middle of the Super Bowl victory parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Louis.'' Hey, that parade was supposed to be in
Jacksonville, or Minnesota, or East Rutherford with the Jets. The
Rams were not even a small dot on last September's projected Super
Bowl map.
</P>
<P>
   There you have it _ today's NFL kickoff provides hope for one
and all, even those teams who at the moment are considered
residents of uncharted territory when it comes to making a major
impact. And basically, that list includes every club except the
Redskins, Tampa Bay, the Rams again, plus the Colts and Titans.
</P>
<P>
   The local focus will be on Texas Stadium, where the outcome of
this afternoon's Heat Stroke Bowl won't necessarily come down to Xs
and Os. This one could be decided by IVs. The football stuff,
however, does provide an interesting contrast.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have regrouped for 2000 in a continuing attempt to
relocate some past glory. The main ingredients are all Dynasty Days
retro, including the new head coach, the new/old offense and future
Hall of Fame quarterback and running back.
</P>
<P>
   All this runs opposite to how the memory process works around
here. Nobody cares about once-was. It's our God-given right for
those Super Bowl things to happen ``every'' year. And it's Troy
Aikman's fault if it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, along comes Philly. Now there's a worthless bunch,
those Iggles. About the last time any of us got excited over
anything involving the Eagles was when Buddy Ryan swallowed the
pork chop bone. Otherwise, it's been a one-team bitter rivalry
(they cared, we didn't). Football-wise, the Eagles were going
nowhere. Or better yet, staying nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's a bright young head coach in Andy Reid, who is
surrounding himself with a collection of talent that potentially
will lead the Eagles to future success. Start with the second-year
quarterback, Donovan McNabb. He's everything Aikman isn't, meaning
young and mobile. He's everything the NFL now wants in its
quarterbacks, meaning mobile.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago this was Aikman, including the mobile part. But he
was the ``everything'' quarterback because he stood strong in the
pocket, and had the big arm. By the way, in-the-pocket meant just
that, too. Most quarterbacks who liked to scoot around ended up in
Canada, or today, it would be in Arena League ball.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has become a relic, so say the scouts and local critics.
Way too stationary back there. Even when Kurt Warner, with a
quarterbacking style from the Aikman era, hurled the Rams to a
world championship, the emphasis on today's NFL quarterback didn't
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain degree, it started with college defenses becoming
much more sophisticated,'' Cowboys director of player personnel
Larry Lacewell said. ``If you can't buy time in the college game
these days, you're in trouble. So colleges are going that way at
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   And also one other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the NFL we're getting a wave of black quarterbacks from the
colleges,'' Lacewell said. ``It was happening in the '80s a little
bit. But the door swung open in the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   McNabb came in that door in the much-heralded quarterback draft
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid has stamped himself as the best of that '99 bunch,''
Lacewell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys still count on there being a place for the
Aikman-style quarterback. Obviously there is _ Warner demonstrated
that. And the best quarterback in the NFL right now is Peyton
Manning, who says he patterned his game after Aikman's.
</P>
<P>
   But McNabb brings that ``now'' element. And he brings new hope
to the Eagles. Based on all accounts from Philly, he's smart and
he's a good kid. Don't think that last part isn't important.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, of course, must smile, reading up on how McNabb has
taken Philadelphia by storm. There's his own TV show, and his own
radio show, where he actually takes calls. The endorsement
opportunities pour in. Aikman has had all that, but these days he
backs away from most everything outside of football except his
charity foundation.
</P>
<P>
   When Aikman was a part of Super Bowl winners, the league was
tougher, much tougher. With the right supporting cast, McNabb will
get his Super Bowl shot, and it could materialize in a hurry in a
watered-down league. In today's NFL, teams are coming and going.
Quarterbacks are coming and going. There is no right or wrong
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this afternoon, even the Cowboys and the Eagles have
hope for the 2000 season. Yeah, sure they do. As the Rams proved, a
winner in this league can come from off the map.

NO LOVE LOST: RAY LEWIS IS STILL BALTIMORE'S GUY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Ray Lewis once purchased 250 tickets to a Washington
Wizards game for Baltimore recreation teams. He has pledged $100 to
the Police Athletic League for every 10 of his tackles. He has
hosted bowling tournaments to aid underprivileged children.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Ray Lewis whom Baltimore knows.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has been voted to three consecutive Pro Bowls. He has led
the NFL in tackles for two years in a row. He generally is regarded
as the best middle linebacker in football.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Ray Lewis whom Baltimore loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravens fans have no second thoughts,'' said Vito Stellino, a
sports writer for the ``Baltimore Sun/. ``He's their guy, and as
far as they're concerned, he's a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Six hours after the St. Louis Rams had defeated the Tennessee
Titans, 23-16, in Super Bowl XXXIV, a fight erupted outside an
upscale club in Atlanta's Buckhead entertainment district, some
seven miles from the Georgia Dome. Two men were left dead, and Ray
Anthony Lewis, then 24, was one of three men charged with their
murders.
</P>
<P>
   Even before murder charges against Lewis were dropped in June,
Baltimore rallied to his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that this city has embraced him,'' Ravens
coach Brian Billick said. ``They have since the incident began,
because they know the Ray Lewis we know.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all saw Ray's confidence in his innocence. The serenity
that he carried himself through the whole process, knowing he was
innocent, I think rubbed off on his teammates and transcended to
the people of Baltimore.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is the second-most popular athlete in town behind Orioles
third baseman Cal Ripken. Among his teammates, Lewis sells the most
replica jerseys, and he gets the most cheers.
</P>
<P>
   When he was introduced with the defensive unit for the first
time this exhibition season, he received a standing ovation. It
wasn't an act of forgiveness, but a show of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was there, and I figured he knew what happened, but
I just didn't think he was capable of murder,'' said Brian Brack, a
36-year-old Ravens' season-ticket holder who wears Lewis' No. 52
jersey to games. ``I feel like he could have come out sooner than
he did, but in the end, he did the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravens fans always have believed in Lewis, the No. 26 choice in
the 1996 draft.
</P>
<P>
   They called Lewis' arrest a rush to judgment, and when his
murder trial began, they blamed an overzealous prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult for them to fathom this man, whom they had
seen give so much of himself, as a murderer,'' said Tony White, the
press secretary for Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley. ``I don't
think it was ever really truly believed here. The Baltimore
community never really accepted that.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lewis left the Cobalt Lounge in the early morning hours of
Jan. 31, a confrontation took place on the street. Punches were
thrown, and a champagne bottle was broken over someone's head.
</P>
<P>
   Jacinth Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24, died of stab wounds
as Lewis and his entourage drove away in his $3,000-a-day rented
stretch Lincoln Navigator limousine.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis was sent to jail for the murders, Baltimore held
prayer vigils, ranted on talk radio and snapped up his replica
jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy enough, but yes, after he was arrested, we saw an
increase in sales for his jersey,'' said Geri Durham, owner of The
Sport Shop near PSINet Stadium. ``I don't know whether it was a
show of solidarity, of support for him or if people thought they'd
be collectors' items if things didn't go well for him. I'd like to
think it was more of a show of support than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 5, Lewis pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of obstruction
of justice for giving incomplete statements to police and ordering
those in his limousine to keep quiet. He was sentenced to one year
of probation and required to pay court costs in return for his
testimony against co-defendants Reginald Oakley and Joseph
Sweeting, whom police called ``longtime associates'' of Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors acquitted Oakley and Sweeting of murder, felony murder
and aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he has paid a heavy price for a crime he didn't
commit. He spent more than $1 million in legal fees, and last month
the NFL fined him $250,000, the largest fine in league history for
a nonsuspended player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about what happened in the off-season,'' said
Lewis, who signed a $26 million contract in 1998 and is scheduled
to make $4.75 million this year after restructuring his deal during
training camp. `` ... That wasn't a good part of my life. I don't
really look back on it, but I know it was there. Football is my
life. That's what I think about.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing Lewis never lost was Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ravens scrimmaged the Washington Redskins at Redskins
Park early in training camp, Lewis acknowledged he heard fans'
taunts of ``We know you did it.'' In Baltimore, they are as
convinced Lewis was guilty only of bad judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he really did anything wrong,'' Ravens fan Greg
Dickey, 31, said. ``He hung around the wrong crowd. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore, all is right with the world again. Back in the
heart of the Ravens' defense, Lewis' only trials now are on the
football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any question about his innocence,'' Ravens fan
Darryl Broll, 36, said. ``He was in the wrong place at the wrong
time. Now that his innocence has been proclaimed, he needs to be
left alone. Let him go back to playing football.''

TROJANS' FUTURE QB BACK IN ACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC didn't play this weekend, but it was a busy
time for future Trojans quarterback Billy Hart, who saw his first
official high school action since committing in July.
</P>
<P>
   The Mission Viejo High quarterback scrimmaged Newport Harbor on
Friday and sounded like current USC quarterback Carson Palmer
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't play well,'' Hart said. ``I haven't played with
a live defense coming at me in about a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart's stock rose this summer, and he was rated the 18th-best
quarterback prospect in the nation by one recruiting service. Hart
passed for more than 1,700 yards last season with 13 touchdowns and
eight interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   His chose USC over Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to commit early. I don't have to think about it and I
can concentrate on high school,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   Since oral commitments are not binding, Hart (6-foot-2, 195
pounds) expects schools to keep recruiting him, especially since
the Trojans received another quarterback commitment from Mater Dei
All-American Matt Leinart in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't bother me at all,'' Hart said of Leinart's decision.
``We get along real well.''
</P>
<P>
   So what will Hart tell schools when they begin calling him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell them I'm not interested,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's commitment was probably a bigger surprise for USC than
Leinart's, because Leinart was considered the Trojans' No. 1
target. Whether they could convince another prep quarterback to
commit was a major question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't think of anywhere else I'd rather go,'' said Hart,
whose father attended USC.
</P>
<P>
   Hart envisions a three-way battle for quarterback, perhaps in
2002 if Palmer turns pro early, from among Matt Cassel, Leinart and
Hart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carson's got another year left and after that it's up for
grabs,'' Hart said. ``There's going to be some fierce
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie returns: Junior tailback Malaefou MacKenzie, limited
to three carries against Penn State because of a hamstring injury,
said his injury stemmed from a nerve problem in his leg that he
hopes will heal in time for Saturday's game against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I aggravated it the last day of training camp in Irvine,''
MacKenzie said. ``I just have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   More depth: For the first time since he arrived at USC, coach
Paul Hackett has two or three players at nearly every position. A
prime example is defensive line, where USC has six players
rotating.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Year 3, we finally have some depth, and that's what you
have to have,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The key, Hackett said, is better research on recruits before
offering scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to evaluate properly,'' Hackett said. ``When we offer
a scholarship, it's because we think someone can help us win the
Pac-10 by their junior year. I don't just mean start for USC. They
have to be better than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in our conference has depth problems. We lost our
quarterback last year and we were a .500 team.''
</P>
<P>
   Road trip: Hackett planned to spend his Saturday watching his
alma mater UC Davis play its season opener, where his son Nathaniel
is a reserve linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Get the tapes: With Colorado playing Colorado State on Saturday,
the Trojans expect to receive game tapes from the contest by 9 a.m.
today. USC will hold a practice tonight and then take off Labor
Day.

IT'S THE MARINERS TO WIN, ALMOST BY DEFAULT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The American League West has developed into an
I-got-it- you-take-it division. No team is playing like it wants to
win it.
</P>
<P>
   One would think one team will emerge down the stretch. But which
team? Since the All-Star break, every team in the AL West has
played below .500.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners have led the division since June 29, but
their 22-27 record since the break is third-worst in the American
League. They have lost 15 of their past 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bad as we've been, we're right back where we started,''
Mariners outfielder Rickey Henderson said. ``It seems like we're a
big brick that isn't moving anywhere. This stretch isn't killing
us, but it is putting an idea into our heads about how we have to
play, and putting some pressure on us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should get down and kiss the ground that we're still in
first place,'' Mariners third-base coach Larry Bowa said. ``We
could be five or six games back the way we've played.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh, A's and Angels fans. Your teams aren't doing any
better. Since the break, the A's are 22-26 and the Angels are 21-25
through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Who's the favorite? The schedule favors no team. The Angels play
18 of their final 27 games on the road; the Mariners and A's each
play 14 of their final 27 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners were the team that was supposed to have so much
starting pitching depth, but it doesn't matter how many you have if
they're all pitching poorly. Since Aug. 12, the Mariners starters
are 2-12. The Angels' and A's starters also have been inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   All three teams have potent offenses. So, that leaves the
intangibles: experience, poise, dealing well with pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The AL West will come down to who can handle the spotlight and
perform under it the best.
</P>
<P>
   The A's are a young and wild bunch. They signed veteran first
baseman/designated hitter Mike Stanley a few weeks ago to provide
some veteran leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final month, you have to control the adrenaline you
have,'' Stanley said. ``You start to see that intensity in the last
month when every single play, every single at-bat gains in
magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny. We play 130-some games that are supposed to all
mean the same, and then the last 30 end up being the most
important. It just works out that way. ... It's an even keel you
have to stay on, and that's something we have to control within
this clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Angels, who have plenty of veterans in their
everyday lineup, plus a solid bullpen. But their starting staff has
three pitchers (Ramon Ortiz, Matt Wise and Scott Schoeneweis) who
are only beginning to learn what it takes to pitch in the majors,
let alone a pennant race. The other two (Kent Mercker and Scott
Karl) are journeymen.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance Tim Belcher will return to provide some
experience in the rotation - if his right elbow is still attached
to his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will need productive starting pitching on a consistent
basis,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``We've seen stretches
of it during the year, and there's no reason we won't see it in
September just because it's September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus as a staff is we expect our guys to pitch their
ballgame by executing their pitches, whether it's the seventh game
of the World Series or spring training in Tempe, Ariz.''
</P>
<P>
   That brings us back to the Mariners, who despite their slump
have the leadership to overcome it. Mariners manager Lou Piniella
was a member of the 1978 Yankees that overcame a 6-game deficit
heading into September to beat the Red Sox. And he managed the 1995
Mariners, who rallied from a 7-game deficit on Sept. 1 to top the
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can see the finish line for the first time,''
Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   And Piniella knows not to look over his shoulder.

WHITE SOX RELYING ON YOUNG ARMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The White Sox have four starting pitchers with at
least 10 victories, but general manager Ron Schueler continues to
be the target of criticism for not adding another one for the
stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   James Baldwin leads the staff with 14 wins, Mike Sirotka has 13,
and Jim Parque and Cal Eldred each have 10.
</P>
<P>
   But Eldred is currently on the disabled list and so is rookie
Jon Garland. Baldwin also was hurt for a while, leaving the White
Sox to rely on a group of young starters, who have struggled.
</P>
<P>
   Schueler did sign veteran Ken Hill, but that was a short-lived
experiment: Hill already has been released.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the White Sox have held off the surging Indians,
holding onto a 7-game lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our young pitchers have gotten us through 130 games, and we're
doing fine,'' Schueler said. ``We've got the biggest (division)
lead (in the American League) and these kids are getting better and
better every time out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sit, Pauly, sit: One trade that Schueler did make was acquiring
left- handed DH Harold Baines from the Orioles, a move which has
reduced the playing time of ex-Dodger Paul Konerko.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko was batting .301 with 13 homers and 66 RBI on July 31,
when the trade was pulled off. But with Baines taking a lot of his
at-bats, Konerko has struggled, hitting .264 with three homers and
12 RBI in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't help,'' said Konerko, who must now sit about two
games per week so Baines can get his at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Baines hasn't exactly thrived in his role either, batting .214
with one homer and eight RBI in 14 games since the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Indian uprising: Even if they don't catch the White Sox,
Cleveland seems to be favored to win the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Having won the past five AL Central division titles with ease,
August usually has been a time for the Indians to put it in
cruise-control and get ready for the playoffs. This year they've
had to win in August and responded by going 18-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a position now where every game is like a postseason
game,'' catcher Sandy Alomar said. ``We haven't been in this
position before. The last five years we've been in first place and
had a big lead. Now we come to the ballpark every day knowing we
have to win that game.''
</P>
<P>
   After further review: While watching videotape of their fight
with the Red Sox, the Devil Rays noticed what they believed to be
``sucker punches'' being delivered by Red Sox first baseman Brian
Daubach. That's why they threw at Daubach throughout the rest of
the game. The Devil Rays sent the videotape to the league office
for review.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a few Devils Rays players, including Gerald Williams,
reportedly waited in a stadium tunnel for Red Sox pitcher Pedro
Martinez. Martinez hit Williams with a pitch in the first inning,
setting off the hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who eventually left before Martinez came out, said he
was waiting for Martinez so he could speak to him.
</P>
<P>
   If you rebuild it, he will come: If the Tigers want to re-sign
outfielder Juan Gonzalez, they had better call that construction
company that built Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   During an 8-4 loss to the Mariners recently, Gonzalez had a deep
fly ball caught on the warning track in left-center and Dean Palmer
had a potential game-tying grand slam caught in the same area.
</P>
<P>
   Left-center field at Comerica is 398 feet from home plate and
center field is 420 feet away. After the game, Gonzalez cursed the
ballpark and walked away from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has said he is ``80-percent'' sure he'll return to
Detroit if the fences are moved in. Tigers owner Mike Ilitch is
considering it, though it seems he hasn't consulted the Tigers
pitching staff.

NORTHRIDGE OFFENSE DOWNRIGHT OFFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ Even Cal State Northridge coach Jeff
Kearin couldn't sugarcoat his team's poor offensive outing
Saturday, a day CSUN managed just 227 yards in a 55-6 loss to Air
Force on Saturday at Falcon Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a low point for the Northridge offense, certainly since
I've been here,'' Kearin said. ``We had no rhythm. We couldn't get
anything going. We couldn't catch some balls, we bobbled some or we
fumbled when we caught them. We had so many three-and-outs and had
to punt. It's difficult for the defense and it hurts your morale.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's only score was a 6-yard touchdown pass from quarterback
Marcus Brady to Drew Amerson. Brady was 15 for 29 for 102 yards
with one touchdown and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest disappointment is the way the offense played,''
Brady said. ``We should've put more points on the board. I take
full responsibility for that. I'm the guy behind the gun. But we
have to look at film and get ready for next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Matadors averaged 450 yards per game. CSUN
managed about half of that Saturday, but in all fairness, it was
playing a Division I-A team. A more realistic test will be next
Saturday, when CSUN travels to face Div. I-AA Southwest Texas
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to throw this behind us and watch film to see what we
did wrong,'' Amerson said. ``We need to come together as a team and
find out what went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem was the turnovers. Freshman D.J. Hackett fumbled
twice after catches, although CSUN recovered one. Running back
Terrelus Wright fumbled once and Brady threw an interception.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Matt Hicks, who did not play Saturday, is expected
to give the offense a boost next week. He just started practicing
with the team Tuesday after arriving as a transfer from Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Silver lining: The CSUN offense sputtered but it gave preseason
All- American punter Ethan Beck nine chances to show off his
considerable leg. He didn't disappoint with his 48-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with that but I don't ever want to punt that much
again,'' Beck said. ``That means we're not doing that well on
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   On one punt, Beck had to receive a high snap. He eluded
defenders, rolled right and still managed a 44-yard kick.
</P>
<P>
   Strong showing: Safety Travis Campbell - a Westlake High product
- had a team-high nine tackles, including two which saved
touchdowns. He also deflected a pass. ... Cornerback Karalus Doyle
had one interception, four tackles and a pass deflection.

   Texas A&AMP;M succumbs to Notre Dame
</P>
<P>
   By NEIL HOHLFELD
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ Midway through the third quarter on a steamy
Saturday afternoon, Texas A&AMP;M had Notre Dame basted and ready to
put on the Labor Day weekend grill. The Aggies were poised to take
the fight right out of the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the kickoff to start the second half and moving
smartly down the field, the Aggies were on the lip of the end zone,
two yards away from snapping a tie and taking command of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But they were unable to get into the end zone and had to settle
for a 23-yard field goal by Terrence Kitchens. After that, nothing
went right for Texas A&AMP;M. The Irish scored two touchdowns in a
6{-minute span and burned the Aggies 24-10 before a record crowd of
80,232 at Notre Dame Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After the aborted drive, the wheels fell off for the Aggies. In
short order, senior wide receiver Chris Taylor dropped a potential
touchdown bomb, cornerback Jay Brooks was beaten badly on a 46-yard
go-ahead touchdown pass, and quarterback Mark Farris flubbed a
third-and-one sneak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge disappointment, because we didn't do the things we
should have done to take control,'' A&AMP;M linebacker Brian Gamble
said. ``We controlled the game except for two or three plays. When
you have the game right there and let things slip out of your grasp
the way we did, it makes you want to cuss or something.''
</P>
<P>
   In a season opener that was played in Texas-like heat _ the
temperature on the field was 108 degrees _ the Aggies wilted in the
second half and missed a chance to get their 2000 season off to a
fast start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let some opportunities slip away in the second half,'' A&AMP;M
coach R.C. Slocum said. ``In most games, there are a couple plays
either way that make the difference. When they come up, you have to
make them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies didn't. During a four-minute stretch in the third
quarter, the game turned on four sequences, all of which went in
Notre Dame's favor:
</P>
<P>
   After starting at their 20 and marching to a first-and-goal at
the Notre Dame two, the Aggies failed to get the ball into the end
zone on three inside running plays. On fourth down from the one,
tight end RoDerrick Broughton moved too soon, pushing the ball back
five yards.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchens kicked a field goal, giving the Aggies only three
points after a 15-play, 75-yard drive that chewed up more than 7{
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were close, but we didn't get it done,'' A&AMP;M guard Chris
Valletta said. ``When you drive the ball all the way down and have
first-and-goal inside the 10 and don't score, it's a moral victory
for the defense. When you get inside the 10, you have to get
touchdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   After the failed drive, the Aggies' defense forced Notre Dame to
go three-and-out. But Irish punter Joey Hildbold boomed one over
Taylor's head 69 yards to the A&AMP;M three.
</P>
<P>
   On a bold call on third-and-six from the eight, Taylor had Notre
Dame cornerback Clifford Jefferson beat by two steps on a fly
pattern down the right sideline. Farris dropped the ball right into
Taylor's hands.
</P>
<P>
   And Taylor dropped the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would have had a touchdown if I had caught it,''
Taylor said. ``I dropped it, plain and simple. It was a total lack
of concentration on my part. When you have chances like that, you
have to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   After the drop, A&AMP;M freshman punter Cody Scates, who averaged
42.1 yards in his first game, punted only 37 yards to put Notre
Dame at the Aggies' 45. On second down, Irish quarterback Arnaz
Battle rolled to his right and hit Javin Hunter in the end zone.
Hunter beat Brooks, a junior making his first start, to put Notre
Dame ahead 14-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was running, we were pushing each other, and I let up a
little bit,'' Brooks said. ``When I let up, I looked back, and I
think he nudged me a little bit. He went by me. That's all part of
the game. I should have made a better play.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Aggies' next possession, they faced third-and-inches at
their 29 when Farris mishandled the snap and had to fall on the
ball short of the first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came down to three or four plays,'' said Farris, who was
16-of-28 for 165 yards in his first start. ``That almost makes it
harder to take. On the road, you can't afford not to make good
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies had their share of good plays, especially from
newcomers Robert Ferguson and tailback Richard Whitaker. Ferguson,
a junior-college transfer from Tyler College, caught five passes
for 79 yards. In addition, two pass-interference calls against
Jefferson came when Ferguson was the intended receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker, a redshirt freshman, saw the bulk of the time at
tailback and carried 13 times for 71 yards. He scored the Aggies'
first touchdown of the season on an eight-yard draw play in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Battle, who struggled in the early going, came to life near the
end of the second quarter. He led the Irish on a seven-play,
70-yard drive, running for 17 yards and passing for 50. He hit Joey
Getherall on a nine-yard strike with 1:31 left in the half to tie
the game at 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with how we handled the momentum swings,''
Notre Dame coach Bob Davie said. ``To come back and tie the game
right before the half and then have the stamina to stay in it in
the second half impressed me. With a young quarterback and a not
real confident defense, I think we showed a solid foundation on
which to build.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Irish went ahead 14-10 on the long pass to Hunter,
they added a 17-yard run by Julius Jones early in the fourth
quarter and a late 32-yard field goal by Nick Setta to put the
Aggies two touchdowns behind in a game they seemingly could have
won.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a lot of ifs and buts and ands,'' Farris said.
``We played well, but we didn't make the plays we had to make. I
made mistakes; we all made mistakes. We didn't play that bad. We
just didn't take advantage of our opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of it, the Aggies turned a game in which they were about
to take control into a two-touchdown loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the hard part for me to believe,'' A&AMP;M senior
linebacker Jason Glenn said. ``There's no way we should lose this
game by two touchdowns. We know what we can do, and we can do
better than this.''

   Just minutes after he had been defeated in the US Amateur
Championship on the third playoff hole last Monday morning, James
Driscoll of Brookline probably wanted nothing more than a ride back
to the clubhouse, where he could be alone with his anguish. He had
come agonizingly close to one of the greatest comebacks in the
event's 100 years, only to be shocked by a 30- to 35-foot birdie
putt, and as Jeff Quinney basked in the glory, Driscoll had to
stand on the third green at Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield,
N.J., and maintain his composure.
</P>
<P>
   He came through flawlessly, which came as no surprise to anyone
who has met this young man since he burst upon the local golf scene
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll accepted congratulations and condolences, shook hands
and received pats on the back. A woman approached and asked if
Driscoll would provide autographs for her two sons who stood by her
side, one of them perhaps 6, the other perhaps 8. The boys, said
the mother, had rooted hard for him all week.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll not only signed but he thanked the boys for coming out
and asked if there was anything else he could do for them. Little
did he realize how much he had already done for a golfing
community's spirits.
</P>
<P>
   It says something about his talent that he clawed his way
through a field that numbered well over 300 and finished second. It
says a lot about his character that so many people from this area
made the trip to watch him play.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Fletcher and Kevin Carey, Cape Cod guys who have crossed
paths with Driscoll in the State Amateur, were in the first car
that pulled into the parking lot Sunday morning. They had left at
3:30 a.m. Tom Landry, executive director of the Massachusetts Golf
Association, was driving home from a family vacation when he
detoured to watch Sunday's final rounds. Pat Dunn of Milton, former
captain of the Boston College golf team, was there.
</P>
<P>
   It's not true that the entire membership of Charles River CC in
Newton made it to Springfield _ though it sure seemed that way.
Paul Murphy, Andy LaVallee and his wife Barbara, Pippy O'Connor,
and Janice Fox and her son Charlie were among the many who made the
trip. Kevin Quinn flew down Monday morning and watched all of four
golf shots.
</P>
<P>
   As match after match went his way, Driscoll prompted mad dashes
to the telephone _ his parents, five brothers, sister, uncles,
aunts, cousins, and nephews calling the local Holiday Inn to extend
their stays.
</P>
<P>
   On the course, the brothers were ever-present, sometimes in a
most valuable way. In Saturday's semifinal win over Luke Donald,
Timmy Driscoll took a few bee stings for the team. His brother had
driven into the woods at the par-5 eighth hole and Timmy Driscoll
was on the move to find the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always running up there if I hit it in the woods,'' said
James, laughing. ``He just takes off to see if he can find it.''
The ball was found, as was a very active beehive, the residents of
which took out their anger on Timmy.
</P>
<P>
   On the next hole, the par-4 ninth, Driscoll again blocked his
tee ball. Again trouble lurked, but he was saved by the presence of
an unsuspecting spectator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit one of my brother Billy's friends right in the butt,''
said James. ``It came back to the edge of the fairway and I
actually made birdie from there, so that was big.''
</P>
<P>
   (The birdie, he meant, not the friend's butt.)
</P>
<P>
   When the match was forced to Monday morning, the playoff was
short and not very sweet, provincially speaking. We can say in
unison that had the par-3 third hole _ the 39th of the match _ been
played Sunday night, Driscoll would have won because he had the
momentum and Quinney admittedly was on the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how many of us think that, the outcome will always
be the same.
</P>
<P>
   What the record book won't show is how Driscoll handled the
entire affair _ almost perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   From the third green, Driscoll was shuttled to the clubhouse,
where he talked to reporters. He was wearing a black 2000 US
Amateur/Baltusrol shirt, bought the evening before by his brother
because ``I ran out of shirts two days ago.'' And long pants? On
such a humid morning? ``Obviously I ran out of shorts.''
</P>
<P>
   He had lost a most prestigious tournament in a most unfortunate
way, but there wasn't a hint of anger. Some breaks had gone his
way, others hadn't. Though he needed time to sort out his thoughts,
Driscoll was hit with question after question about his golf
future. Would he turn pro, as he had planned? Or would he retain
his amateur status long enough to play in the Masters, into which
he had earned a berth for his runner-up finish?
</P>
<P>
   At this time, said Driscoll, the Masters had the inside track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think I have to play in the Masters,'' he said.
``Wouldn't you play in the Masters if you could?''
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll was told that Tom Scherrer, the 1992 US Amateur
runner-up to Justin Leonard, turned down his berth, went pro, and
has yet to qualify for the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I feel like would happen,'' said Driscoll. ``I'm
just going to enjoy (the Masters) as an amateur. It'd be much more
enjoyable going there as the Amateur champ instead of the
runner-up; that will be a little bit of a downer, but it'll still
be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a pause, then Driscoll was asked what he would take
from the tournament. Without hesitating, he said: ``Having everyone
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Like good friend Ryan Monahan and his brothers, David and
Nicholas, whom he hadn't seen in years. Then there was another
longtime friend, Brendan Buckley. ``He left at 3:30 in the
morning,'' said Driscoll. ``I can't believe they'd do that for one
hole. I'd much rather wake up and watch it on TV than to drive and
see one hole. Man, I can't believe they did that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for comparisons to another young golfer from Brookline who
was involved in a memorable USGA event, Driscoll laughed. ``He's
almost bigger than the game,'' he said of Francis Ouimet, who in
1913 won the US Open, then followed with three national amateur
titles. ``I'm from the same town, but that's about it. He's a much
better story than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, we'll grant him that, because he obviously knows his
history.
</P>
<P>
   What he may not know, however, is just how inspirational a tale
he authored. He's got a great deal of talent, a huge heart,
character to match, and probably more fans than he ever realized.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rest stop detour
</P>
<P>
   Some were surprised that Tiger Woods committed to playing in
next week's Bell Canadian Open, but it makes sense. Had he not
jumped in, it would have meant a layoff of seven weeks between the
NEC Invitational and the Presidents Cup (Oct. 19-22). This way,
it'll be just five. The Presidents Cup will signal a busy stretch,
however, as Woods has three events lined up directly after that:
the National Car Rental Classic at Disney World, the Tour
Championship, and the American Express Championship at Valderrama
in Spain. Then comes the PGA of America's Grand Slam event, his own
Williams World Challenge charity event, and the World Cup in Buenos
Aires . . . This will be Woods's first appearance in the Canadian
Open since 1997, when he shot 70-76 at Royal Montreal GC, which
remains the only ``true'' cut he has missed in 86 PGA Tour starts.
We qualify that because the PGA Tour considers Woods to have missed
the cut at the 1998 AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, the year
that tournament's third and final round was played six months after
it was suspended. Woods did not return to resume, thus got penciled
in for a missed cut. His streak of consecutive cuts made is at 55,
well short of Byron Nelson's record of 113 . . . School has already
started for many pro golfers _ LPGA Tour Qualifying School, that
is. At the first of two sectionals, there was one notable
advancement _ Beth Bauer, who recently turned pro after two
outstanding seasons at Duke _ and several failures _ Jenny
Chuasiriporn, the 1998 US Women's Open runner-up; Marcy Newton, who
recently won the US Women's Amateur; Julia Boros, granddaughter of
Julius; and Divina Delasian, younger sister of LPGA Tour rookie
Dorothy. There will be a second sectional Sept. 11-15 (Chuasiriporn
is entered again, which the Tour allows) and the final stage is
scheduled for Oct. 16-20 in Daytona Beach, Fla. . . . Scorecard of
the week belongs to P.H. Horgan III of Newport, R.I. In the second
round of the Reno-Tahoe Open, Horgan made just four pars to go with
five birdies and nine bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another amateur's hour
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the glare of Driscoll's performance was a great
performance by another local golfer, Kevin Johnson of Pembroke. He
opened 64-64 at the BUY.com Tour's Permian Basin Open in Odessa,
Texas, then steadied himself in 25-mile-per-hour winds to close
70-70 and notch a three-shot win. It was his third career victory
on the minor league circuit and vaulted him to 17th on the money
list ($130,617). The top 15 on the money list at the end of the
season earn PGA Tour cards for next year, and there are just six
events left before the season-ending BUY.com Tour Championship . .
. It's hard to imagine a more popular winner of this past week's
New England PGA Championship than Kirk Hanefeld, director of golf
at The Ridge Club in Sandwich. The longtime head pro at Salem CC in
Peabody, Hanefeld closed with a 6-under 64 at Thorny Lea GC in
Brockton to win by nine shots and end a string of tough luck _ six
runner-up spots _ in this event. He recently turned 44, and with
players of his caliber, the immediate thought process turns toward
the Senior PGA Tour. Hanefeld shudders. ``A lot of guys can't wait
to be 50, but I'd like to be 20,'' said Hanefeld . . . He was one
of those outgunned by Hanefeld, but Marshfield CC's Jimmy Dee put
on a pretty good performance at Thorny Lea, finishing in a tie for
seventh. The 6-foot-9-inch Dee rarely finds the time to get away
for these two- and three-day individual events, but was glad he did
as he shot 70-70-72 . . . Apologies to Bob Pierce of Wellesley,
author of a most amazing feat _ a pair of aces in the same round at
Wollaston GC in Milton _ because when we mentioned the fact here a
few weeks ago, we mistakenly said it was done by a ``Bill Pierce.''
``My brother Bill loved it,'' said Bob. ``He's been sending the
article to all his friends, though he is a much better golfer.''
Bob aced the 130-yard sixth hole with an 8-iron, then the 165-yard
12th with a 5-iron, but is quick to point out the first one was
pure luck. He said his shot hit a sprinkler head to the right of
the green, then ran the width of the green and rolled into the cup
on the left side. The one on 12, he said, was more traditional, two
quick hops and in. No, there weren't any cars at stake, but the
thrill will last a lifetime . . . How thirsty are New England
golfers? The 2001 US Senior Open, to be held at Salem CC in Peabody
has become the earliest sellout in the history of the event. A
random drawing was conducted a few weeks ago and all ticket
applicants will soon be notified of their status. There are limited
corporate opportunities available. For information, call Mary
LoBello at 978-927-4350, ext. 12.

   U.S. basketball team finds identity in love of the game
</P>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   LAHAINA, Hawaii _ In 1992, they were the basketball gods who
came down from Mount Olympus to perform in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   Bird, Magic and Jordan. Sir Charles, the Mailman and Clyde the
Glide.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have to chase the gold medal. They just had to let
it come to them like a crown finding its rightful place on the head
of a king.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, they were the big guns who stormed through Atlanta with
more devastating firepower than Sherman's troops.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone and David
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   You practically needed a stepladder to get their autographs, and
their sheer size and strength was intimidating and overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is a new millennium, a new age, and Olympic Dream Team
III is a whole new breed of cat. Kittens, actually.
</P>
<P>
   There are no legends, unless you count Gary Payton's mouth.
There are no singular and distinctive personalities, unless you
count Alonzo Mourning's scowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a bunch of guys who hoop it up for the love of the
game,'' Kevin Garnett said. ``Call us the Dream Team or the
Fantastic Five or the Dirty Dozen or whatever. This ain't about
history, man. We're just playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how they play.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of get-to-know-you scrimmages among themselves and
against the USA Select Team of college players, they have filled
the Lahaina Civic Center with more trash talk than a convention of
sanitary engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Forte of North Carolina sees an opening down the lane and
tries to slither through the crack in the defense toward the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Whack! Garnett comes swooping down from somewhere out of the
West Maui Mountains to reject the shot. With his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know for sure you're still in college!'' barks Payton.
``Because trying something like that tells me you got a lot to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton takes a turn sitting on the bench, but his mouth never
rests. He harasses Duke's Jason Williams and rides Notre Dame's
Troy Murphy. Then, just to keep his tongue sharp, he goes after his
own teammates with a stand-up-on-the-sideline routine that is
worthy of a cable TV special and just as R-rated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're having a good time, but the atmosphere of
professionalism is amazing,'' says head coach Rudy Tomjanovich.
``That's what I'm loving about this the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton is the only member of the team with Olympic experience,
having played at Atlanta. But that has not left Team USA lacking in
the area of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, Mourning and Jason Kidd were voted by their teammates as
co-captains, a choice that was obvious after the first few
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   They are a team whose pedigree has been discounted in some
corners because of the absence of O'Neal and Kobe Bryant from the
NBA champion Lakers and San Antonio's Tim Duncan. Those three
represent three-fifths of the All-NBA First Team last season, but
this hardly means there will be a lack of skills on parade in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   It will just be a different kind of show, in which the rest of
the world will be so colorfully introduced to a pair of
23-year-olds in Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Vince Carter, who makes
chest-over-the-rim dunks look as easy as dropping a flower lei
around a tourist's neck. Workouts often have looked like recess at
the School of No Gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Carter had the eye-popping play of Team USA's opening game
against Canada on Thursday, taking an alley-oop pass whipped high
over the hoop by Kidd and rattling the rim with a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supernatural,'' Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the new breed withstood a feisty first half from
the USA Select Team of college all-stars to win 111-74 in Honolulu.
They were led by Carter with 24 points on 10-for-10 shooting,
including five crowd-wowing dunks.
</P>
<P>
   Though they have size in Mourning, Garnett and a rejuvenated Vin
Baker, they are a team that will make its mark with speed and
versatility. There are Allan Houston, Tim Hardway, Steve Smith and
Payton to make one-on-one moves to break down defenders. There is
Ray Allen to shoot over zones. There are Kidd's laser passes into
the low post to Antonio McDyess and the others for easy layups.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, they are hungrier than sharks in a feeding frenzy.
Rudy T has even installed a half-court press that has the 6-11
Garnett taking the point spot in the middle of the floor. At one
point on Thursday, the Select Team went six straight possessions
without getting the ball past midcourt as Garnett picked off some
passes and tipped others to teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you supposed to do?'' moaned a frustrated Forte,
shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett flipped the ball ahead to Kidd, who shoveled another
no-look lob pass to Carter, who then dunked it back over his head
while cruising past the rim.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new millennium and a new game, even for the Dream Team.

US TEAM HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With opening ceremonies in Sydney a dozen days away, more than
half of the 600-member US team is already Down Under or on its way.
</P>
<P>
   The track and field people, who were decompressing on an island
off Australia's Gold Coast, are now in Brisbane. The basketball
teams are in Hawaii, with the men headed for Japan for tuneups
against the Japanese and Spanish this week and the women going to
Australia for exhibitions against the French, Slovaks, and Poles.
</P>
<P>
   The final group to go through the San Diego processing center
will be the tennis team, which is playing at the US Open in
Flushing Meadows. The first arrivals in Oz were the horses, who've
been under quarantine there for a month.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next president . . .
</P>
<P>
   It's all but certain that Wellesley attorney Paul George will be
the US Olympic Committee's next president. George, who was the
team's chef de mission at the last Winter Games in Nagano, was
tapped last week by the nominating committee as its choice to
succeed William Hybl, whose term ends this year. Since the USOC
board, which will vote in December, traditionally approves the
nominee, George is as good as elected. In the reorganized USOC,
with its strong CEO (Norman Blake), the president will be more of a
board chairman who deals with broad policy issues. George, a smooth
and savvy diplomat with a fat Rolodex, likely will deal with
international relations. That'll mean plenty of frequent flyer
miles on Swissair. Also nominated as one of three vice presidents
is George's fellow townsperson Cynthia Kelly, badminton's
representative on the USOC . . . While the US Greco-Roman wrestling
grapple went on and on in federal court _ the last we heard, Matt
Lindland was back on the team for the third time _ the obvious
solution seemed to get overlooked. Let Lindland and rival Keith
Sieracki settle it on the mat this week in a best-of-three. Though
they already had an arbitrator-ordered rematch last month, neither
man was ready since Sieracki was jet-lagged and Lindland had to
scramble to make weight. Now they're both fit, rested, and in
adjacent time zones. All they need is a referee _ and a video
camera . . . One arbitration, at least, solved itself. US cyclist
Christine Witty got the disputed Olympic time trial spot by default
when challenger Tammy Thomas tested positive for high testosterone
levels . . . The Americans aren't the only people running to
arbitrators. The Australians still had several cases going last
week, involving triathlon, volleyball, and kayaking. And in
consensus-loving Japan, star Suzu Chiba went to court after being
kept off the swimming team . . . Messy situation, meanwhile, for
the US kayakers, who've not only lost Angel Perez from the Olympic
four but could lose the entire entry. Once the Cubans turned thumbs
down on a waiver for Perez, a naturalized citizen, the South
Africans claimed that the entire K-4 boat should be ineligible
since Perez was in it when it earned the Olympic spot at the world
championships.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Planning ahead
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the ``Magnificent 6'' tour that was thrown together
(without heroine Kerri Strug) after the Atlanta Games, USA
Gymnastics is well ahead of the curve this time. Even before last
month's Olympic trials, the federation had signed up top stars for
its post-Sydney tour without waiting to see whether they made the
team (Shannon Miller, Dominique Moceanu, and Vanessa Atler, who
didn't, still will tour). This time everything is spelled out, from
appearance fees (medalists will make significantly more) to college
eligibility issues. The 40-city tour, which runs from mid-October
until mid-December, stops at the FleetCenter Nov. 18 . . . Though
US women's tennis coach Billie Jean King has been catching flak for
bypassing Lisa Raymond for doubles, her decision was sound. Though
Raymond is ranked No. 1 in the world, her partner (Rennae Stubbs)
is Australian and thus ineligible to play with her at the Games. So
it made sense to stick with Venus and Serena Williams, who won
Wimbledon together this year, especially since Serena can step in
at singles if there's an injury. King, meanwhile, insists that
Venus saying she wanted Serena on the team was a nonfactor in her
decision. ``I could care less,'' King said. ``If Venus said she
wouldn't go without Serena, I'd say, `Who are the next two
players?' '' The US men, meanwhile, caught a break when Andre
Agassi, the defending Olympic champion, was bounced from the US
Open in the second round last week. Had he reached the final,
Agassi would have barely a week to get to Sydney, reset his body
clock, and practice . . . Seems that cyclist Lance Armstrong has
become invulnerable since surviving cancer. Last week's head-on
collision with a car on a rural French road shattered his helmet
and demolished his bike, but left Armstrong (and wingman Tyler
Hamilton of Marblehead) with only bruises. Armstrong, who won the
Tour de France this year, is favored for at least one gold medal in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A good-hands guy
</P>
<P>
   With Brad Friedel replacing injured keeper Adin Brown on the US
men's soccer team, the federation has quieted critics who felt that
the Americans, who've never survived the prelims, needed a veteran
in goal. Friedel, who started at the 1992 Games and plays for
Liverpool, has 66 international caps and has been backup on the
last two World Cup teams. Replacing injured midfielder Chris Armas
will be Sasha Victorine, the Los Angeles Galaxy rookie . . . Though
Paris received higher marks during the initial evaluation, Beijing
is still the favorite to host the 2008 Summer Games. Since Athens
is 2004 host, the IOC is unlikely to stage the subsequent Games in
Europe, and since the Chinese capital lost the 2000 bid to Sydney
by only two votes, it's considered to be next in line. The major
barriers, as always, are human rights issues and congestion. Also
making the cut were Toronto, Istanbul (Turkey), and Osaka (Japan).
Lopped from the list were Havana, Bangkok (Thailand), Seville
(Spain), Cairo (Egypt), and Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia). The Lords will
choose the site next July in Moscow, where president Juan Antonio
Samaranch makes his swan song . . . For the first time since its
civil war ended in 1995, Bosnia-Herzegovina will compete, Serbs and
Croats together, under its own flag in Sydney. The Bosnians will
send at least nine athletes. The biggest challenge hasn't been
ethnic politics, but money. The Bosnians have barely a fifth of the
$500,000 they need . . . The new pariah in the international
sporting family is Afghanistan, which the IOC has banned from the
Games because the country's Taliban rulers forbid women from
competing in sports . . . And you thought the Lords of the Rings
were junketeers? Laos is sending seven government officials to
oversee three athletes (all no-hopers) in Sydney . . . Not all of
the pyrotechnics in Sydney's closing ceremonies involve traditional
fireworks. There's quite the hubbub over the inclusion of as many
as 200 drag queens as part of a celebration of Australian film.
Since ``The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert'' won the
1995 Oscar for costume design, the organizers figured it belonged
with the likes of ``Crocodile Dundee'' and ``Mad Max.'' That has
produced angry protests from talk-show callers who say the drag
queens amount to an endorsement of homosexual lifestyles. Most
Sydneysiders, though, don't seem to mind. The city's annual gay and
lesbian Mardi Gras parade is hugely popular.

QUICK THINKING BY BELICHICK

<TEXT>
<P>
   There has been a method to Bill Belichick's madness.
</P>
<P>
   As Belichick was putting together the Patriot team he will send
onto the field Sunday to face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Foxboro
Stadium, his personnel choices had people wondering. The release of
veteran tight end Ben Coates when no apparent adequate replacement
existed, the release of veteran wide receiver Vincent Brisby when
the same seemed true, the waiving of veteran left tackle Bruce
Armstrong and the long period before he was re-signed for the
league minimum of $440,000 (when he had given his knee to this team
last season), and finally the release of veteran running back
Raymont Harris in the final cutdown that left the roster with only
two real halfbacks, were four major moves that left some scratching
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus was that while those players are past their prime
(in some cases well past their prime), you don't get rid of a
player until you have an adequate replacement. Once, nine years
ago, Belichick felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Back then he took over an aging Cleveland Browns team and
adopted the conventional wisdom. He kept many veterans he knew were
on their last legs in hopes of getting through one more season. He
ended up with six wins and a lot of bitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had gotten old and there was almost nothing left there
(from the team that had reached the AFC title game just two years
earlier),'' Belichick recalled. ``There was just enough to make me
hang on to a lot of veterans. After eight games we were 4-4 and I
can still remember looking at our schedule and thinking, `How are
we going to win another game?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We won two games after that. Four or five guys on our
offensive line could barely get in the way anymore, so you look and
say sooner or later you'll have to replace these guys who are
playing for you. But I held on to too many of those guys and the
whole group got old.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belichick's opinion, that retarded the Browns' progress as
the team went 6-10 and then suffered through back-to-back 7-9
seasons before finishing 11-5 in 1994 with his rebuilt roster. He
beat his mentor, Bill Parcells, in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is widely regarded as a man who learns from his
mistakes. That was apparent as he shaped his first Patriot roster,
littering it with younger, speedy players, and ridding himself of
veterans who might have been better short-term solutions but were
clearly not the answers to his long-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like a slow team,'' Belichick said. ``I slowed it down
in Cleveland because we had to, but that's not me. I like speed. By
the end, we threw a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point in New England was the decision to keep
third-year wide receiver Tony Simmons and release Brisby. Neither
has done much in New England, but Simmons has youth and speed on
his side while Brisby had diminishing speed and a resume that
included only 45 catches the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Simmons faded from view last year and was not enough
of a factor this summer to win Brisby's job, he has averaged 21
catches in his two years and done it for less money.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Coates, last year it seemed he'd lost his burst
of speed and was unable to separate himself from defenders. Now
he's in Baltimore as a backup, and the word is he's in great shape
and the Ravens are happy to have him alongside Shannon Sharpe. But
in New England, Coates's production had slid, he had taken a
physical beating over the years, and he was considered a bad
influence on kids he should have been mentoring _ like Rod
Rutledge, who got into a car wreck last season, allegedly while
drag racing Coates.
</P>
<P>
   Coates denied that, but when it was time to make a decision
about his future in New England, the cost of keeping him was
considered higher than his value. Belichick would not try to argue
that either Eric Bjornson or Rutledge is better than Coates today,
but how much longer would he last and at what price?
</P>
<P>
   What Belichick did with his first roster was create salary cap
room, add speed and youth (27 of his 53 players are in their third
year or less) where dullness and age had begun to fester, and turn
the Patriots toward the future while still keeping them competitive
in the less-than-formidable AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   For the first shot out of the box, that's about all you could
ask the boss to do.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Left with slim pickings
</P>
<P>
   If you are still wondering why the Patriots are in the sad shape
they're in, just go back and look at the drafts from 1996-98. With
six extra picks as compensation for losing Parcells and Curtis
Martin to the Jets (two ones, a two, two threes, and a four), New
England had 32 picks in those three years. Players selected in
those drafts should be the backbone of the present team plus
providing salary cap relief, because they would still be on
contracts below market value. Well, here are the grim facts. Of
those 32 selections, only five became starters, and three (Terry
Glenn, Lawyer Milloy, Tedy Bruschi) came in the '96 draft that was
still primarily run by Parcells (with the infamous exception of No.
1 pick Glenn). After that, Bobby Grier was in charge and made 19
selections over the next two years that netted only two starters,
unless you include 1998 seventh-round draft choice Jason Andersen,
who may start at guard even though he remains in a dogfight with
young Derrick Fletcher. As for the six players obtained for
Parcells and Martin, half of them are no longer even active
(Sedrick Shaw, Damon Denson, Robert Edwards) and the other three
are Simmons, Andy Katzenmoyer ('99 draft pick), and Chris Floyd.
You wouldn't take all six of those guys for either Parcells or
Martin, let alone both. So it goes. Or, more to the point, so it
went . . . The 1997 draft was a particular disaster. Of the nine
players Grier selected in his first season in charge of the
Patriots' selections, only one is a starter anywhere in football
(Brandon Mitchell with the Patriots) and four of his nine
selections are out of the game . . . Here's a sad commentary. A
league source said that, according to a recent survey, the divorce
rate among NFL players has risen to 75 percent . . . When the NFL
Players Association challenges the Cincinnati Bengals' insistence
on including a ``loyalty clause'' in player contracts later this
month, it should be a slam dunk win for the players. The Bengals
came up with the clause after tiring of Carl Pickens ripping the
coach and administration last season, but the union stepped in
before the Bengals even tried to use it. The union believes it
would become just a way to harass out-of-favor players . . . Rookie
Brian Urlacher was one of the talks of the draft in April. The
massive former safety from New Mexico was seen as one of the
draft's best athletes, and the Chicago Bears grabbed him early and
installed him as their starting strong-side linebacker without
competition. Well, now the competition is done and for the time
being so is Urlacher, who was benched in favor of less-heralded but
more reliable Roosevelt Colvin. Defensive coordinator Greg Blache
had a simple explanation. ``We're stuffing an elephant down his
throat,'' Blache said. ``He started to gag on it, so you give him
the Heimlich maneuver.'' In other words, there was too much to
learn too soon for a small-college product who had never played
linebacker. Still, coach Dick Jauron has made five defensive
changes to a unit that was one of the NFL's leakiest last year, and
one does involve a rookie. Second-round choice Mike Brown will open
the season at free safety, with Shawn Woodson shifting to the
strong side . . . Speaking of the Bears, they are near a deal for a
$500 million renovation of Soldier Field after threatening for
years to move to the suburbs. If the city and state reach an
agreement acceptable to the Bears, the team would probably have to
play at least one season elsewhere, with Notre Dame Stadium the
first choice . . . If Dallas Neil finds a job punting somewhere in
the NFL, he has his mind to thank for it as much as his foot. Neil
sent out a mannequin's leg to each of several NFL teams after he
went undrafted. Written on it was, ``I'd give my right leg to kick
for you.'' That caught the Falcons' eye, and he was brought in. He
kicked well enough and also made himself useful as an undersized
tight end (6 feet 1 inches, 215 pounds). Here's hoping a guy that
original finds a job . . . Randy Moss's contract runs through the
2001 season, but the Vikings will likely try to renegotiate at the
end of the season, and it will cost them a fortune after St. Louis
signed Isaac Bruce last week to a $40 million deal with an $11.5
million signing bonus. If Bruce is worth that kind of money, what
is Moss going to command? This is something the Patriots also have
to concern themselves about, because Glenn's status is the same as
Moss's. They would like to avoid Glenn getting to free agency, but
if he has a career year and Moss sets a new market high, which he
will, the Patriots next winter will have to make very hard
financial and football decisions. In that order . . . The
Buccaneers decided to take a big gamble when they put the future of
their team in the hands of second-year quarterback Shaun King late
last season, because with their defense, they are solid playoff
contenders, but when they got to the NFC Championship game, King
led them nowhere but to the golf course. It's still his team, but
he has been erratic this summer, which is to be expected from such
a young quarterback. Against New England two weeks ago, he was 9
for 23 for 191 yards and two of his completions came on tipped
balls to Jacquez Green that accounted for 113 yards. Take them away
and he was 7 for 21 for 78 yards on a night when the Patriots were
showing little of the kind of complex defenses he'll face Sunday.
Still, wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson insisted the team's future is
safe with King. ``He knows where to put the ball at times and he's
not afraid,'' Johnson said after the Patriots game. ``Anytime you
have that combination, you should be pretty all right.'' The issue
is whether pretty all right will let the Bucs compete with the
Rams, whose offense is pretty unbelievable.

   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Assistance slow in coming
</P>
<P>
   NFL assistant coaches continue their fight with NFL owners for
fair benefits. A year and a half ago, the owners agreed to pay at
least $100 a month for Medi-Gap insurance to retired assistants who
qualified to help cover interim health insurance until Medicare
kicked in. That's all well and good, but the cost of such a policy
is now $7,200 a year, according to one retired coach. Worse, no
assistant has received a single check because the owners have yet
to figure out how to pay the taxes on the money to their best
advantage. ``Fact is that a hundred bucks doesn't buy a thing and
these guys are getting rich and they still won't pay it,'' the
angry ex-coach said. This leads to only one question on the matter
of NFL owners. What's wrong with these people? . . . Rams
quarterback Kurt Warner recently signed a deal similar in value to
Bledsoe's present contract (which expires at the end of the 2001
season), and it exceeded the value of Mark Brunell's. Warner's deal
will pay him $46.35 million over the next seven years, including a
$11.5 million bonus. Midway through the 1995 season, Bledsoe signed
a $42 million extension that included a $14 million bonus. Warner's
deal is heavily backloaded, however, with $15.7 million coming in
the first three years and $30.65 million in the final four. What
Warner has to worry most about is the rise in his base salaries in
the final four seasons, averaging $5 million a year. Worse, St.
Louis has to pay him an additional $6 million bonus after the third
year of the contract to put the final four years in effect. If
that's what a guy who's had one good NFL season gets paid, what do
you give a guy who got to 10,000 passing yards faster than anyone
in history and is a three-time Pro Bowl player in danger of
breaking every passing record in history? That will be for the
Patriots to decide, and they must do it soon . . . Speaking of
quarterbacks on the cusp of cashing in, Brian Griese's contract
with Denver is up after this season, although he will only become a
restricted free agent, giving the Broncos the right to match any
offer. Still, with the quarterback shortage in pro football, if
Griese has any kind of success, he stands to get a huge raise . . .
Ex-Patriot tight ends coach Mike Pope, now with the Giants, has
more than 300 drills to get his tight ends catching the ball. Among
the oddest is when he stuffs a towel in the player's face mask and
has them jump from a prone position to catch a pass. The idea is it
makes the player focus his eyes and get his head into position to
see the ball coming at him. This is Pope's second tour of duty with
the Giants; he was on Parcells's Super Bowl staff in the 1980s . .
. Here's Belichick's reaction to being told that intense former
Redskins coach Joe Gibbs once didn't recognize Oliver North on his
practice field when North was in the middle of his Congressional
testimony on the Iran-Contra scandal. ``I can relate to that,''
Belichick said. ``Sometimes you go two or three days without
picking up the paper. That's when you gotta get a grip on
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some advanced film work
</P>
<P>
   Last week Ravens coach Brian Billick brought in the players'
wives or significant others and addressed them about what he was
trying to get done and what he thinks the pressures are on players'
spouses. He also had director of player programs Earnest Byner and
vice president of public relations and marketing Kevin Byrne
address them, insisting that both use the computerized Power Point
to make use of video and audio that would catch their attention.
Billick believes that young people must have anything said to them
reinforced by video. When he told his team that this was now ``the
real world'' and anything done in preseason meant nothing, he used
video from the movie ``Wall Street'' to emphasize the point. In the
midst of his speech, up came the face of Michael Douglas, playing
the heartless Wall Street investor Gordon Gekko delivering his
famous ``greed is good'' speech. Billick went on to say a lot of
guys in that room were playing for their next contract and he
didn't think that was a bad thing . . . Is Ravens linebacker Ray
Lewis ready to play? He's bulked up to 260 pounds and has only 7
percent body fat. He also is mulling over which national TV outlet
he will appear on to explain the tragedy in Atlanta last Super
Bowl. Lewis has told friends he's not yet ready to speak because he
is still so angry at Atlanta prosecutors that he would rip them. He
told them he's waiting for the issue to be ``settled in my heart''
before he speaks. But bet on this: At some point this season, Lewis
will make a dramatic splash on national television to try to win
back his reputation, which was sullied not only by the tragedy but
also by the people he was spending time with _ people who appeared
to be low-level thugs. Lewis also told friends he understood that
two people are dead and because of the kind of neighborhood he grew
up in, he well understands the ravages of such violence on a family
. . . The new Houston franchise has a downtown celebration planned
Wednesday to announce its new nickname, logo, and team colors.

   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ The defense was supposed to be better.
And the offense was supposed to be a high-powered machine once
again.
</P>
<P>
   Neither happened Saturday for Cal State Northridge. The result
was another lopsided loss to a Division I-A program.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force thrived on the option and ran for 583 yards en route
to a 55-6 win over CSUN in front of a near sellout crowd of 50,166
at Falcon Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors had just two first downs in the first half, leaving
a tired defense to try to contain the option.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most beautiful thing to watch when it's run
right,'' CSUN coach Jeff Kearin said. ``And their quarterback (Mike
Thiessen) was impressive, especially with the way he threw the
ball. I don't think we expected them to throw as well as they did.
They mixed it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force threw for 115 yards, 13 more than CSUN. Ironically,
CSUN had more rushing yards (125) than passing (102). It's probably
the only time that will happen all year.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors can only hope it's the only time they're involved
in a game like Saturday's. CSUN trailed 27-0 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some mental breakdowns but at the same time, you have
to give their defense credit,'' running back Terrelus Wright said.
``Their defense played well. But we weren't ourselves. The Cal
State Northridge they saw is nothing like the team we really are.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN didn't get a chance to show off its offensive weapons
because it couldn't get any drives established. The run wasn't
working. When quarterback Marcus Brady dropped back to pass, he
either didn't have time or overthrew receivers. His receivers
didn't help by dropping several passes. And Brady, who's so adept
at scrambling, never had anywhere to run. It wasn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get anything going,'' Brady said. ``It was
frustrating. We fumbled or went three-and-out, and that's like a
turnover to me. We couldn't get into a rhythm and it showed.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN committed three turnovers. The Matadors fumbled four times
but recovered two.
</P>
<P>
   Brady was 15 of 29 for 102 yards, one touchdown and one
interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too much was different,'' Brady said. ``We just weren't
executing. I thought our offensive line did great. There were a
couple of sacks, so I don't know if they were tired physically, but
they did good.''
</P>
<P>
   Thiessen ran for 109 yards on 10 carries and scored once.
Running back Scott Becker had 97 yards on 13 carries. Seven
different players scored touchdowns for Air Force, and 16 players
ran the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force struck first, using a three-play, 45-yard drive to
score. Qualario Brown took a pitch left, ran down the sideline,
faked a defensive back and scored from 25 yards out. CSUN went
three-and-out before Air Force went on a 14-play, 77-yard drive
that spanned 5 minutes, 44 seconds and resulted in a 27-yard Dave
Adams field goal.
</P>
<P>
   On CSUN's next series, Wright fumbled on the second play, and
Air Force drove 35 yards to score in just three plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the way our offense controlled the ball,'' Air Force
coach Fisher DeBerry said. ``That was a factor we had coming into
the game because we had so much respect for their offense. They do
such a good job of spreading you out all over the field and trying
to isolate you one on one. I thought at times our defense really
chased the ball well and we had some fine open-field tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN wasn't in the open field much. Every time either Wright or
Bruce Molock got a handoff, there wasn't much room to run. Molock
had the longest run of the day - a 54-yarder down the right
sideline to the Air Force 13 - that set up CSUN's only score, a
6-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Drew Amerson. That culminated a
seven-play, 80-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it was our mental breakdowns,'' Wright said. ``We
couldn't drive and get first downs. We only had (two) in the first
half. We hurt ourselves. Overall, in the second half, we started
fighting back. We realized that if we'd done that in the beginning,
it could've been a different outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't.

PACERS NOT RELENTING, JUST RELOADING 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers would like all their fans to know one thing:
They feel your pain.
</P>
<P>
   They know what you're thinking in the wake of their latest
trade, one that sent their best (some would say only) rebounder,
Dale Davis, to Portland for the young, promising but still unproven
Jermaine O'Neal. You're thinking, ``There goes the season,'' and
that the chant for 2000-01 might as well be, ``Wait till last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that people might see it that way,'' general
manager David Kahn said after Indy lost a second starter from the
Eastern Conference champs. (Mark Jackson went to Toronto.) ``It's
fair for them to think that. But we feel confident about our team.
We think we can have our cake and eat it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been considerable hand-wringing in Pacer Nation. Chat
rooms are ripping the deal, saying the Pacers have written off the
season. But there was a similar hue and cry last summer when Indy
traded the sturdy, reliable Antonio Davis for the feral Jonathan
Bender. The Pacers lived to tell about it, advancing to the NBA
Finals, while also witnessing Austin Croshere develop into a solid
NBA player.
</P>
<P>
   But who is going to rebound on a team that, frankly, was not
very good at the enterprise? (Indy was 20th in rebounding.) We know
it won't be Rik Smits, who, given his size (7 feet 4 inches) may be
the most feeble rebounder in the history of the game. He may not
even come back. The Pacers will look for someone to do that,
recognizing at the same time that no one on their roster rebounds
as well as Davis does.
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose will rebound out of the backcourt. Reggie Miller
might, too, something ex-coach Larry Bird wanted. The Pacers also
are high on bruiser Jeff Foster, who got plenty of time in the
summer league and didn't look out of place.
</P>
<P>
   And the two active players involved in Thursday's deal (we're
excluding the retiring Joe Kleine) had one thing in common: They
ranked among the top 33 in rebounds-per-minutes last season. So did
Croshere (13.1), who ranked ahead of such glass eaters as Chris
Webber, Karl Malone, Derrick Coleman, and Antonio McDyess. O'Neal
(12.8) ranked ahead of McDyess, Malone, and P.J. Brown. (Then
again, Tony Battie ranked ahead of Croshere and O'Neal.)
</P>
<P>
   So, relax folks. Someone will get the rebound, although Davis's
meanness will be difficult to replicate. There was no guarantee
that, even with Davis, the Pacers would get back to the NBA Finals.
Miami, New York, and even Philadelphia might get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   What the Pacers undeniably have done is set themselves up for
the next several years, if not this one. Young, tall, athletic
players aren't easy to find, and they now have two in Bender and
O'Neal. (Let's not forget Al Harrington, another young-un who can
play.) The Celtics, who offered three No. 1's for O'Neal, were
enthralled with the kid's potential, especially after watching
O'Neal destroy their front line last season in the FleetCenter. On
the other hand, Portland was so enamored of him that it sat him on
the bench for most of the Western Conference finals, even when its
need for a big man was so acute it had to turn to an undersized
Brian Grant.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers shelled out big money to Croshere for a reason.
O'Neal gives them a shot-blocking threat (Davis and Smits accounted
for 50 percent of Indiana's blocks) whom they courted last summer
when he was a free agent. The Pacers also have rid themselves of a
locker room lawyer (Jackson) as well as another player (Davis) who,
despite just receiving a huge extension, still felt
underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Hold off on the crepe, folks. Chill. Portland has certainly
positioned itself to take a more serious run at the Lakers (and the
title) with the addition of Davis. But the Pacers haven't punted on
2000-01. They have issued the challenge to their high-bracket wage
earners and now it's time for all those players who felt they
deserved the big bucks to go out and earn them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blazers bulk up
</P>
<P>
   Portland, meanwhile, continues with its Dense Pack Summer,
recognizing its Achilles' heel from last spring's conference
finals. The Blazers can now throw Davis, Shawn Kemp, as well as
Arvydas Sabonis at Shaq. The Blazers believe they have a two- to
three-year window of opportunity and the additions of Kemp and
Davis have only solidified their already potent team. It's still
early, but the Lakers have yet to address their biggest weakness of
a year ago, a solid power forward and/or backup for Shaq. Hey,
Pervis Ellison is still available . . . Speaking of ex-Boston big
men, Kleine is still shaking his head over the unexpected windfall
(more than $1 million) he received as a throw-in to make the
numbers work in the Davis-O'Neal deal. Portland re-signed Kleine,
then shipped him to the Pacers, who are expected to waive him. Big
Joe has no intention of playing next season and already has signed
on as a radio analyst for Arkansas basketball. ``It's surreal.
Unbelievable,'' Kleine said Friday from Little Rock, Ark., where he
is renovating a house and plans to live. ``My agent woke me out of
a dead sleep on Wednesday night and I kept saying, `Yeah, right.'
It was right out of the blue. I couldn't believe it. You just want
to get down on your hands and knees and give thanks.'' Then again,
the money also in some way makes up for the disappointment Kleine
felt last spring when the Blazers mystifyingly left him off their
playoff roster in favor of the never-used Gary Grant. That move
backfired when Portland ran out of big bodies against the Lakers .
. . The first exhibition game for the US men's Olympic basketball
team against Canada Thursday resulted in a predictable rout. Some
writers from Canada, however, thought the US showed less than the
obligatory diplomatic respect when ``Ode To Joy'' was piped through
the building instead of ``Oh, Canada.'' An official blamed the
error on the tape person, who apparently pushed the wrong button .
. . Discerning Celtics fans may have had a flashback if they
watched any of last weekend's US Amateur golf tournament. The
victor, Jeff Quinney, is the son of Eugene, Ore., attorney Bob
Quinney, who represented Danny Ainge in Ainge's first negotiations
with the Celtics. Jeff Quinney has caddied for Ainge in several
member-guest tournaments in Oregon and the two also play together
in Arizona. (Jeff Quinney goes to Arizona State.) The elder Quinney
said, ``This summer, when Jeff was caddying for Danny, Danny said
to Jeff, `If you get to the Masters next year from getting into the
finals at the US Amateur, I want to be your caddie.' I told Danny
to get in line.' '' . . . AEK Athens has opened training camp, but
7-3 Iakovos ``Jake'' Tsakalidis is a very conspicuous no-show. The
Suns, meanwhile, are trying to solve the thorny contract situation,
and the matter may end up going to arbitration. A Greek source says
that AEK feels it has Tsakalidis under contract, having his signed
agreement from four years ago to unilaterally extend the contract,
which it did. In addition, AEK's owner reportedly is livid after
seeing the Suns unveil a ``Free Jake'' shirt, because he helped
bankroll the move of the Tsakalidis family from Russia to Greece
and helped turn ``Jake'' from a swimmer into a basketball player.
Stay tuned . . . You have two more days to bid on a pen that Toni
Kukoc used to sign his new contract with the 76ers. As of Friday,
someone had bid $425 for the pen, as well as a mini-basketball
autographed by Kukoc and a photo of the historic occasion. (One
person bid $350 with the comment, ``This is all I ever wanted.'') .
. . Tim Hardaway, the only free agent on the Olympic team, is still
trying to use Indiana as bait to get Miami to re-sign him. He wants
years (and money, of course) while the Heat want to see whether
he's healthy before going out more than one year. Prior to Miami's
big deals (Grant, Eddie Jones), it wanted to give Hardaway a
one-year deal to protect its cap space next summer. But Grant and
Jones will take care of that, so Hardaway wants more than a year.
The problem is that he's been hurt the last two years (and at the
wrong times) and turned 34 on Friday. ``I'm looking forward to
playing with the Heat; I want to stay in Miami and finish my career
in Miami,'' he said. ``But I have to look at other options, too.''

<P>
   The marvelous Mavericks
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is great,'' Don Nelson was saying this past week on his
car phone, en route to check out some property he owns on Maui. ``I
feel reborn. I feel like a hobo on a ham sandwich.'' Nellie has
been rejuvenated thanks to the hands-on, enthusiastic, and,
needless to say, ultra-generous style of Mavericks owner Mark
Cuban. The Mavs, who won nine of their last 10 and 16 of their last
21 games, have added Howard Eisley, Christian Laettner, Terry
Mills, Dana Barros (although not for long) as well as some
intriguing rookies (Donnell Harvey, Courtney Alexander, and Etan
Thomas.) ``We needed to address two positions, center and point
guard,'' said Nelson. ``I think we've done that. I like our team. I
can't wait to get started.'' Cuban handled most of the
phone-to-phone negotiations in the deals, but Nellie, gearing up
for the season in Hawaii, was never far away. He is, after all, the
coach and general manager. ``We correspond four or five times a day
either by phone or e-mail,'' Nelson said. ``I'm up at 5 a.m. out
here so I can be involved. It's wonderful.'' Cuban has delivered as
advertised, even if he has had a bump or two along the way. On
three occasions this summer, he has forked over $3 million, the
maximum allowed, to make deals work. Paul Gaston, the recipient of
one of those CARE packages, would give up skiing before he'd agree
to do that once. ``For all my basketball life, I've worked with
wonderful people, but they've also been (fiscally) conservative,''
Nelson said. ``They were out not to lose money, to have a good
product but also have a low payroll. Now, money is simply not an
object.'' Cuban and Nelson didn't stand pat despite their
auspicious April and now are two-deep (and, in some cases,
three-deep) at each position. (Alas, Shawn Bradley is still the
center, but Laettner is going to get time there as well.) ``In some
ways, this team reminds me of the teams I played on in Boston,
where we always had a guy ready to step in who we knew could do the
job,'' Nelson said. Cuban has even made Dallas a place where
players want to go, hard as that may be to believe. Dale Davis
reportedly had Dallas as one of his three preferred places to be
dealt; Portland was not on the list. Said the recently acquired
Eisley, ``The perception has changed about the Mavericks. Before
you used to look at Dallas and know you were going to get a win.
Now that has changed.''

LESHER COMES UP BIG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it came time to expand the rosters from 25 players to 40
Friday, 29-year-old Brian Lesher was among those called up, and he
said he just wanted to make a contribution to the slumping Seattle
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, what he provided was far from a meager boost in the
Mariners' 4-1 victory over the Red Sox. He drilled a seventh-inning
pinch-hit triple to right field that scored a run and followed it
with a two-run double in the ninth. He also had a stolen base.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lesher's first major league appearance in more than two
years and his first visit to Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big day for that young man,'' said manager Lou
Piniella. ``He got us ahead and then he put us further ahead in the
ninth inning with a double. We had him in spring training and we
liked him. I'm glad we called him up, I will tell you that. You
hope to find a couple of guys who can come in here and help your
situation out. Today, Lesher did that in big style.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesher, who was born in Antwerp, Belgium, said he wasn't at all
nervous despite the fact he hadn't played in the majors since July
21, 1998, when he was with Oakland..
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my job basically is going to be mainly hitting against
lefthanded pitchers,'' said Lesher, whose triple came off
lefthander Rheal Cormier and whose double was off lefthander Rich
Garces. ``When you're nervous, you take that energy and put it into
focus. That's what I always tell myself, when you're nervous it's
easier to focus. That was definitely the case tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesher was a spring training invitee and signed as a free agent
Jan. 14. Last year, he spent the season in Vancouver and it was the
first time since 1995 that he hadn't appeared in the major leagues.
Part of the trouble was a rash of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of grinding days in the minor leagues
where it's frustrating,'' he said. ``You always wonder, `Hey,
should I give it up?' You just keep battling and persistence pays
off. I've had a bunch of injuries that have kind of curtailed my
seasons before. It seems like I'm always missing a month because of
an injury. Right now, I'm 100 percent healthy so hopefully things
will take off from here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Lesher said he wasn't looking for anything
specific, just a pitch to hit. Right fielder Trot Nixon was playing
shallow and Lesher's blast sailed over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Lesher said in some ways it was nice to have the element of
surprise on his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it can be to your benefit,'' said Lesher. ``They
don't know you and the pitcher doesn't know you. You just take it
for what's there. I've been up in the big leagues in '96, '97, and
'98. That kind of groomed me a little bit. I haven't gotten much
playing time but the experience back then kind of pays off for this
year. It's a lot more fun playing up here than in Triple A. I just
tried to stay focused on each pitch and I got some pitches to
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time Lesher (6 feet 5 inches) actually thought about
playing pro basketball and following in his father's footsteps. His
dad was playing in Belgium at the time of his birth and his family
stayed there another year before moving on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to go back and see where I was born,'' said Lesher.
``That was my first love, basketball. I played baseball just
because my friends played it. I knew I wasn't going to go too far
in basketball. I knew in the minor league system you could develop
your skills. I was kind of a late bloomer. I knew the end was in
basketball. I didn't know where I could go in baseball so I tried
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's performance was one of his most thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably one of them, contributing to a pennant-racing
team like that,'' he said. ``It's definitely one of the bigger
days. They've been struggling, I just got here. So, I really
haven't been through the ups and downs they've been through.
Hopefully, this will get things going.''

BRUINS FLEX THEIR MUSCLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only time UCLA football usually gets close to smash mouth is
when someone plays the rock group's CD.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Bruins of late have had a few great All-American
offensive linemen like Jonathan Ogden and Kris Farris and several
1,000-yard runners like Skip Hicks and Karim Abdul-Jabbar. But
Bruin football has never, ever been accused of being one of those
physical college frats that mashes opponents. The gutty little
Bruin image from the '50s and '60s is still stuck to their cleats.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, that was Alabama on the bottom of Bruin shoes
-- college perennial Alabama, defending SEC champ Alabama, No.
3-ranked Alabama, a program so historic that it played in the Rose
Bowl game five times before the Bruins made their first-ever
appearance in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   The Crimson Tide arrived with nine returning starters from the
No. 2-ranked run defense of 1999, and went home with stories to
tell about the running back who would not die, DeShaun Foster, and
his large escorts on the Bruin offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruin rushing game dominated the Tide during their 35-24 win
at the Rose Bowl, Foster tying the school record for rushing
attempts (42) enroute to a career-high 187 yards. The Bruins gross
yards rushing before sacks and miscues was 237, or almost a quarter
of what Alabama allowed all last season.
</P>
<P>
   This was surprising to most of the 76,640 in the house,
especially the 20,000-plus from Alabama but undoubtedly some of the
Bruin not-so- faithful who arrived with low expectations after an
injury-plagued 4-7 season.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the least bit surprising to the Bruins. The Bruin
running game started working toward this kind of an effort since
the 1999 season ended with most of them physically limping and
mentally frustrated by critics.
</P>
<P>
   Once too often, senior guards Brian Polak and Oscar Cabrera
heard someone say the Bruins were soft. Once too often, Foster
heard someone say that he was out of shape last season. Bob Toledo
still has his bag of trick plays and reputation for passing
schemes, but he wanted the Bruins to knock people down as much as
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the coaches, if (Foster) doesn't run the ball at least
30 times, I'll be upset','' Toledo said. ``I wanted to give the
horse the ball. I may be surprised we ran as well as we did, but it
was part of the plan. We wanted to shorten the game and keep the
ball out of their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I took last season personal,'' said the 319-pound Polak, the
only member of the five returning starting linemen who played all
11 games a year ago. ``We were inexperienced and injured, and it
showed, so we all make a personal commitment for this season.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant working out as a group four days a week during the
offseason and spending that one off day working on team unity. The
line would have dinner together or some other social activity every
Wednesday during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our goal, to be the most physical offensive line,''
said the former Hacienda Heights-Bishop Amat star. ``We say it when
we play, we say it when we practice, we say it when we lift. It's
all mindset, be physical all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we'd have the ball that much to where we could
control the game,'' said the 303-pound Cabrera. ``But our thought
coming in was that we knew we could dominate. We all believe that
if we as a group win our battle, we will win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The first preview came on the Bruins' second drive, after
starting quarterback Cory Paus had already been KO'd by a separated
shoulder. With sophomore Ryan McCann under center and trailing 7-0,
the Bruins went on a 18-play, 64-yard drive that featured three
fourth-down conversions, took 9:06 off the clock, and ended with
the first of three Foster touchdown runs.
</P>
<P>
   That set a tone that repeated itself often, with another time
consuming 80-yard drive in the second quarter, a McCann touchdown
pass to Mitchell off play action in the third, and ball control
clock killing in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's 187 yards came the old-fashioned way, with the junior
running back refusing to be dropped by first contact, always moving
forward, always requiring three tacklers on defense to stop the
play.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Foster looked like the freshman All-American of 1998,
who ran for 673 yards and 10 touchdowns. It is entirely unfair to
use 1999 as a barometer, when a high ankle sprain derailed him
during a 100-yard game against Stanford and hindered him the rest
of the season. His work against Alabama recalled the Charlie
White-Marcus Allen days at USC, when a 40-carry afternoon was quite
normal and amazingly efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches always preach don't go down on first contact. Make
someone miss and then see what I can do,'' said Foster. ``You
really don't know how many times you've carried the ball when
you're out there. You just get in a rhythm and be prepared to carry
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   As Foster was talking, Bruin strength coach Mike Linn walked by
and said ``next week 60 (rushes).'' Foster laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised we ran well,'' said the former Tustin High
running back. ``We have the same (linemen) we had last year, only
now they're healthy and more experienced. And I wasn't worried
(about McCann). He's been taking reps every day. I knew he could
get the job done. I just wanted to help so he wouldn't have to
carry the team.''
</P>
<P>
   That's perhaps the best message from Saturday's win. Toledo the
innovator doesn't have to sweat any hurry-up cram sessions for his
quarterbacks. With Foster and a running attack to depend on, the
Bruins can spot up big plays for Freddie Mitchell and Brian
Poli-Dixon. Their speed becomes even more deadly within the context
of a solid running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's awesome,'' said Polak of Foster. ``I love watching him
run. I'll sometimes look up and I'll see him stiff-arm someone or
break a leg tackle. It's incredible. It makes any offensive lineman
say I want to block for him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo called the win, the Bruins' first against a team ranked
in the top three since 1990, one of his finest moments, but within
the context of being pleased, not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believed they could win,'' said Toledo. ``You have to
believe you can beat someone. I told the kids, yes, they're Alabama
... but you're UCLA'.'' And they were smashing.

LEE'S ADVANCEMENT NO SMALL POTATOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although he has dug a few potatoes in his day, it's
cabbage that the unforgettable Hyung-Taik Lee is excavating from
the asphalt of Flushing Meadows. A wad that amounts to $55,000
minimum.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't too shabby for a 24-year-old tennis player whose
previous career earnings amounted to $26,316. But Hyung-Taik Lee
hasn't been the least bit shabby as the farthest-out hanger-in at
the US Open, his first major. He has been, in fact, unforgettable.
As the second week commences, Lee, a qualifier ranked No. 182 on
earth, is a certified member of the surviving 16.
</P>
<P>
   Well, unforgettable if you happen to live in Korea, where his
exploits Saturday in the Open arrived live and early Sunday morning
via television. Those exploits being rolled up in almost 2 1/2
hours of holding off German Rainer Schuttler, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   And unforgettable if you talk to this jovial, bouncy fellow
(through a translator, of course), and hear him say: ``I am
creating history. Everything I do is a record.''
</P>
<P>
   You can tell this isn't boastful blab by surveying his face,
which lights up with wonder beneath the ever-present white cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I win a match it's a record for Korea. No Korean
man has done this (fourth round of a major).'' I didn't have the
heart to tell him that a Korean woman had beaten him to the US
fourth round, Duk Hee Lee in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he concedes, ``it may be hard for me to go farther.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it may be hard since the person in the way is named
Sampras. However, Pete Sampras's current winning streak is merely
three matches while Lee's is 11. ``Also a record,'' he smiles,
recalling a maze that has included the bush league Bronx
Challenger, the dog-eat-dog Open qualifying tourney, and three
rounds in the big show, where he has nailed US Olympian Jeff
Tarango and 13th-seeded Franco Squillari from Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's English parallels my Korean (two words apiece), but he
also has his own version of ``Are you kidding?'' It comes out like
this when you ask him if he'll beat Sampras: ``Ho ho ho!'' Blended
with appropriate eye-rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. So he goes home with a pocketful of change, and a
newly burnished reputation. Lee is well beyond his rural native
village of Hang Sung in Kang Won Do province, the Idaho of Korea,
where potatoes are more prevalent than tennis balls, and bounce
funnier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I dug some potatoes as a boy. Planted them, too,'' says
Lee, who never dreamed he would be mashing tennis balls at an
international level. However, he attended a grammar school where
tennis was the sport of choice, and by the fifth grade he was
noticed and got coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, an angel, the electronics company Samsung, took him
under its wing so he could get around and play without undue
financial strain. Helpful, too, was the jock loophole: legally
dodging the military draft that would have impeded his progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you win a gold medal in the Asian Games, you are exempt
from service,'' he says. ``That was my out. The same for Chan Ho
Park, who piches for the Dodgers. Samsung has taken good care of
me. They like me to stay in good hotels to get my rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest hasn't come that easily because much of his off-court time
has been spent in a dental chair. ``I have had problems with my
teeth. Painful. But they're getting fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in the wilds on Court 10, Schuttler, who ranks 115 lengths
ahead of Lee at No. 67, started to have problems when the nimble
Korean got his teeth into it, displaying a well-balanced style,
skipping to the net often enough to keep the German guessing.
</P>
<P>
   Schuttler felt lonely. Although a record mob of 31,872
infiltrated the grounds, it seemed to him that they were all
Koreans pulling for Lee. Actually, Court 10's capacity is only 620.
But most of that number were Koreans, and they were very gleeful
and loud on behalf of their countrymen. Constantly they yelled
something that sounded like ``Whiting!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means `fight,' '' explained one of Lee's constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like my home court,'' Lee says. ``They made me feel so
good. I have made a lot of friends here on 32d Street'' _
Manhattan's Little Korea _ ``and I can get good food and lots of
kimchi. That's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, what is a Korean without kimchi, the wonderfully pungent
cabbage concoction that aromatically advertises its sometimes
overpowering presence? Italians and French without garlic would
understand. Hyung-Taik Lee, the Kimchi Kid, has advertised his
presence well for the homeland. He's a happy man, unexpectedly in
the cabbage, financially and on 32d Street.

DAUBACH IS THE ONE WHO PILED ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is not to say that baseball disciplinarian Frank Robinson
will come to the same conclusion. But here's what Brian Daubach did
to inflame the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, according to one major league
official involved in the case, after repeated viewings of the brawl
last Tuesday night:
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't hit anybody,'' the official said. ``He dived into
the pile, but there's no way he hit anybody. And I saw it from
every conceivable angle.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach's innocence has never been in doubt on the Red Sox'
side. They were appalled at the accusations made by the Devil Rays
_ and repeated the next day by general manager Chuck LaMar _ that
Daubach had delivered cheap shots during the brawl, which was
touched off when Gerald Williams charged the mound after being hit
by a pitch from Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Hernandez, the Devil Rays' closer, dragged Daubach out
of the pile by his hair, towered over him while delivering a
finger-pointing lecture as Daubach gripped his injured left elbow,
and eventually gave him a two-handed shove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hernandez was in the bullpen when the fight started, and he
probably saw Daubach go flying into the pile,'' the official said.
``But once he was in the pile, he didn't hit anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Daubach probably did was give (Lou) Merloni a concussion.
The pile was collapsing and Merloni was falling backwards, and you
can see Daubach's right knee hit Merloni in the back of the neck
when Merloni's head was just inches from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's when he hyperextended his elbow, too.''
</P>
<P>
   What ensued was a farce the WWF would have been embarrassed to
stage. The Devil Rays spent the rest of the night throwing at
Daubach, leading to a procession of ejections that ultimately
totaled eight. A lot of that nonsense could have been avoided if
starting pitcher Dave Eiland had had better aim and drilled Daubach
with a pitch, satisfying the Devil Rays' apparent need for
retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild may have had Eiland in mind
when he chastised his pitchers for having such poor aim.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild, a highly respected pitching coach with the Reds and
Marlins who was in the Braves' minor league system when Jimy
Williams was on Bobby Cox's coaching staff, is probably looking at
a stiff suspension after admitting his pitchers were throwing at
Daubach. Gerald Williams, in addition to being punished for
charging the mound and punching Martinez, also should be looking at
major down time for coming back onto the field, however briefly,
after being ejected.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the latest episode in what has been an unhappy
season for the Devil Rays, who had visions of packing the house _
and winning _ with a team loaded with beer-league sluggers like
Jose Canseco, Vinny Castilla, Fred McGriff, and Greg Vaughn.
Rothschild has another year left on his contract, but with his
detractors already whispering that he's lost control of the
clubhouse, he is an obvious candidate to be sacrificed at season's
end.
</P>
<P>
   Was Daubach singled out by the D-Rays because he was a
replacement player? No. Were they aware of it? Absolutely, and they
let him know, too, beginning with Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I wasn't the only one,'' Hernandez told Mark
Topkin of the St. Petersburg Times. ``In the heat of the battle,
and to top it off he was one of them, he ain't going to be treated
politely.''
</P>
<P>
   No mention by Hernandez that one of the Devil Rays pitchers who
threw at Daubach was Corey Lidle, another former replacement
player.
</P>
<P>
   And isn't it about time that the union calls off the dogs on the
handful of replacement players still playing and just put the whole
business to rest, once and for all?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Comerica the beautiful
</P>
<P>
   They opened the season 9-23. Their hitters complained that their
new ballpark was too big. Slugger Juan Gonzalez, imported to be the
centerpiece of the lineup, got off to a dreadful start. The fans,
discouraged by lousy spring weather and the team's poor start,
stayed away in droves. It was shaping up as another brutal season
for the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a disaster,'' general manager Randy Smith said Friday,
``and there's no question, there was a lot of soul-searching going
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as bad as it got, we never gave up on the club.''
</P>
<P>
   And so here they were in September, back to .500 and within five
games of the wild-card lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be done,'' Smith said. ``There are five teams in front
of us, but for guys like Phil (Garner), Bobby Higginson, Brad
Ausmus, Dean Palmer, .500 is a benchmark, not a goal. The players
have bought into Phil's positive philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the team needed time to adjust to Comerica Park, and
the Tigers are now using the dimensions to their advantage. Garner
and batting coach Bill Madlock, who regrettably spent just a year
in the Sox organization before leaving when he wasn't promoted,
have preached a much more patient approach to hitting, and it has
paid off. The Tigers are walking a little more at home than on the
road (240 to 225) while striking out much less (333 at home, 462 on
the road).
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, a two-time AL MVP in Texas, is still having an
off-year _ .302 and just 19 home runs and 61 RBIs going into
Saturday _ but his presence has made a difference, according to
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson (.290, 25, 85), Palmer (26 HRs, 88 RBIs), and Juan
Encarnacion (.294, 64 RBIs) are all having productive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a big difference in the way teams attack us,'' Smith
said. ``Gonzo got into some bad habits early. They weren't pitching
to him, and he was chasing balls out of the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that the rest of the club is hitting, Gonzalez has
picked up, too, though there are still times when the Yellowstone
dimensions of the ballpark frustrate Gonzalez and the other Tiger
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a tendency to remember all the balls we hit to the
track, while we forget the ones the opponents hit,'' Smith said.
``We had a recent situation where Dean Palmer hit what would have
been a grand slam. The players were frustrated, I was frustrated.
But then in the Oakland series, the A's hit some balls that were
caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitchers like it the way it is. The hitters would like us
to move the fences in. We'll review it after the season, but we
feel like we've developed a home-field advantage. We pitch, we play
defense, and we're playing good fundamental baseball.''

<P>
   Attention, shoppers
</P>
<P>
   Sox GM Dan Duquette now has committed in excess of $25 million
next year to four players: John Valentin, Mike Lansing, Jose
Offerman and Dante Bichette. That's something to keep in mind as
you review a partial list of the stellar class of players eligible
for free agency after this season.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitchers: Mike Mussina, Orioles; Andy Ashby, Braves;
Kevin Appier, A's; David Cone, Yankees; Darren Dreifort, Dodgers;
Mike Hampton, Mets; Denny Neagle, Yankees; Steve Trachsel, Blue
Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Relievers: John Franco, Mets; John Wetteland, Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   First basemen: Rico Brogna, Red Sox; Andres Galarraga, Braves;
Mark Grace, Cubs; David Segui, Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Second basemen: No one of consequence.
</P>
<P>
   Third basemen: Cal Ripken (as if he's going anywhere).
</P>
<P>
   Shortstops: Mike Bordick, Mets; Alex Gonzalez, Blue Jays; Alex
Rodriguez, Mariners; Jose Valentin, White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Catchers: Todd Hundley, Dodgers; Sandy Alomar, Indians; Charles
Johnson, White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielders: Manny Ramirez, Indians; Jay Buhner, Mariners; Ellis
Burks, Giants; Eric Davis, Cardinals; Ron Gant, Angels; Juan
Gonzalez, Tigers; Jeffrey Hammonds, Rockies; Paul O'Neill, Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   DH: Harold Baines, White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   There's another group of players who will become free agents if
options are not exercised, including Sox pitchers Tim Wakefield,
Ramon Martinez, Rod Beck, and Tom Gordon. There are some big names
on this list, including Tony Gwynn of the Padres, Edgar Martinez of
the Mariners, Tino Martinez of the Yankees, John Smoltz of the
Braves, Curt Schilling of the D-Backs, Darryl Kile of the
Cardinals, Pat Hentgen of the Cardinals, and Pete Harnisch of the
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State of Grace: agitation
</P>
<P>
   Grace is frustrated, but not terribly surprised, by the lack of
progress in negotiations with the Cubs and parent Tribune Company.
``I've been around a long time,'' Grace told Chicago reporters last
week. ``I've seen the way the veteran star Cubs have been treated.
(Rick) Sutcliffe. (Greg) Maddux. Andre Dawson. (Ryne) Sandberg. The
only person who has ever gotten even talked about for a big, long
contract is Sammy (Sosa). All the others were last-minute hemming
and hawing. That's the way it is. Does it make them bad people? No.
It just makes them different than most organizations.'' The Cubs
are high on Korean first baseman Hee Seop Choi, who was hitting
.330 with 9 home runs and 23 RBIs in 31 games in the Double A
Southern League. ``Right now we're going to play out the season,
see what happens and find out if Andy (MacPhail, the Cubs
president) wants Hee Seop Choi hitting behind Sammy next year,''
Grace said. ``Good luck. Sammy will get walked 300 times.'' Think
about this. Grace came into this season with the second-highest
career batting average of any Cub since 1940, behind Madlock.
Higher than Hall of Famers Ernie Banks and Billy Williams. He
ranked second in doubles, seventh in runs, eighth in hits, seventh
in RBIs, and fifth in walks. Yet in the course of his distinguished
career, Grace has had just one multiyear contract (three years,
$12.85 million) and 10 one-year deals, including this season, which
calls for him to be paid $5.3 million . . . Here's a thought: If
Giants manager Dusty Baker, who has not re-signed with the club,
decides to go elsewhere, there are two other free agent managers
who might make a nice fit in San Francisco. Toronto manager Jim
Fregosi was a Giants scout before being hired by the Blue Jays, and
Lou Piniella worked with Giants GM Brian Sabean in the Yankees'
system . . . Despite their many denials after Arizona Republic
columnist Pedro Gomez reported that the team had borrowed $20
million to meet operating expenses, it's widely known that the
Diamondbacks have overextended themselves. The $20 million loan
came on top of two years in which the D-Backs reportedly collected
a total of $53 million from their 29 limited partners. The D-Backs
have a payroll of around $80 million this season, but attendance
has fallen in each of the last two seasons to 12th in the majors.
They reportedly lost $30 million last season, with a big chunk of
cash going toward debt service for the franchise's $130 million
share of the $368 million needed to build Bank One Ballpark. And
according to one big-league source, it isn't going to get easier.
The D-Backs owe nearly $88 million in deferred salary to seven
players: Matt Williams ($11.7 million), Jay Bell ($14.5 million),
Randy Johnson ($24 million), Steve Finley ($9 million), Todd
Stottlemyre ($16 million), Luis Gonzalez ($5 million), and Tony
Womack ($7.75 million). That will make it tough to dump salary even
if they want to. And don't forget they gave Travis Lee, the first
baseman they traded to the Phillies in the Schilling deal, a $10
million signing bonus after agent Scott Boras found a loophole in
draft rules. ``They're leveraged to the max,'' the source said.
``They have the biggest payroll in the mail in the history of Major
League Baseball.'' . . . Where are the Sox in terms of deferred
dough? Well, $12 million of Pedro Martinez's $75 million deal is
deferred, as is $2 million of Nomar Garciaparra's package.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deal is closed
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Giants, whose payroll of $55 million is far below
the fatcat D-Backs, took a three-game lead into the final month of
the season while locking up their prospective free agents before
they even make it to the free market. Sabean and his top assistant,
Ned Colletti, just signed closer Robb Nen to a four-year deal that
could be worth as much as $32.5 million. Nen, as the best reliever
in the free agent class, probably could have commanded much more on
the open market. Instead, he opted to stay put, like lefty Kirk
Rueter earlier this season. Nen's contract gives him the right,
before the third and fourth years, to decline an option and become
a free agent again . . . The Pirates last week signed their
third-round draft choice, Chris Young, a 6-foot-11-inch righthanded
pitcher from Princeton. Hoops junkies will remember Young as a
two-time All-Ivy League center on the Tigers' basketball team.
Young, who received a signing bonus in excess of $1 million, will
forgo his senior year of hoops (Ivy league rules prohibit athletes
from turning pro in one sport and playing as an amateur in
another), but Pirates scouting director Mickey White said the team
agreed to honor Young's desire to finish the academic year. The
club will fly him to Florida for an instructional league during
Princeton's fall recess and may do so on some weekends as well. The
Pirates were sold on Young, White said, after watching him pitch
for Chatham in the Cape Cod League. ``We honestly thought all along
that he wanted to play baseball,'' said White, ``and I saw him
having all the makings and the intensity to be a pitcher.'' White
had a number of scouts look at him on the Cape. ``We're a little
different from everybody else because we have to be,'' White said,
alluding to the Pirates' small-market status. ``We find talent,
evaluate it, draft it, but then we stay on them before we sign
them. If we think it's better not to sign them, we don't.'' . . .
With Carl Everett's favorite team, the Yankees, coming to town next
weekend, this is a good time to review why the Yankees, who drafted
him first in 1990, let him go in the expansion draft to the Marlins
two years later. According to Sabean, who was the Yankees' scouting
director when they drafted Everett, it wasn't because he'd fallen
out of favor. ``There were family issues _ as a young kid he got
into some jams,'' Sabean said. ``There was a lot of pressure on him
for a lot of factors. He also had all kinds of problems with his
legs. He has sprinter's speed, but his legs were very susceptible
to muscle pulls. Still, we knew what we had.'' Sabean said that
unlike such stars as Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez, who were
drafted out of high school and rose rapidly to stardom, Everett's
progression was more typical. ``He was one of those kids who did it
from the ground up,'' Sabean said. ``He came from a very loose
background, baseballwise. His high school coach, Billy Reed, is in
his own way an icon, but it wasn't a real structured program. In
high school, you just show up and play. It's a big change when you
go to the minor leagues and play six days a week and have to work
out before games.'' The Yankees allowed Everett to escape to the
Marlins, Sabean said, not because they were dissatisfied with him,
but because they lost Charlie Hayes in the draft and were afraid
they might lose other veterans. So they protected another veteran
and left Everett, a Single A minor leaguer, exposed. ``We knew what
his ceiling was,'' Sabean said. ``But we needed to see if he would
survive the rigors of the minor leagues.'' . . . And
congratulations to Hartford's Emily Gresh, a former member of the
Boston Ballet who was honored as a ``Murray Scholar'' as one of
seven winners of a nationwide essay contest. The award of a $5,000
journalism scholarship was made by the Jim Murray Memorial
Foundation, established in memory of the Trinity College graduate,
Pulitzer Prize-winning sports columnist, and the best newspaperman
I ever hope to work with. Gresh has written for Boston Ballet
publications and was awarded first prize for prose fiction last
year from the Trinity English department.

JOB JUST BEGINNING FOR COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ The lights were on until midnight all week,
videotapes popping in and out of Bill Belichick's VCR. The Patriots
coach was looking for any new information, much like a detective
searching for that one clue to solve the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   With Belichick, every aspect of the opponent is broken down and
dissected. This is the defensive mastermind's normal routine.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's season opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is
special. This will be his first appearance as the head coach of the
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   And to New England sports fans, first impressions are
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the same as I remember him as a young player in
Cleveland,'' said defensive tackle Chad Eaton. ``He goes over every
little detail. He doesn't leave anything to chance. Everything is
accounted for. Everyone is responsible for something. If everyone
does their job, we should have a great day and a great season.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton's views are shared by teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys have responded well to him,'' said receiver/returner
Troy Brown. ``He lays it out for you. There's no mystery. You do
what he says and execute the way he wants you to execute. You can't
get more basic than that. But there's no mystery with Bill. If
you're a player, it's easy to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick had the players practice in full pads three straight
days last week. It's not known whether he will take this approach
every week, but his message was that the Patriots need to be
physical. According to one player, the practices were spirited and
the hitting was hard. The pace was fast, as they expect it to be
against the Tampa Bay defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to practice like you play, and Bill likes to play
hard,'' said defensive back Otis Smith. ``One thing he'll never
tolerate is getting beat physically. It means you're not
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the trenches is where the game will likely be decided.
The one unnerving aspect for Belichick has to be the unsettled
nature of the offensive line. He used Derrick Fletcher at left
guard a lot in practice last week because Fletcher's 6-foot-6-inch,
355-pound frame is more imposing than Jason Andersen's (6-6, 305).
It appears both will play, with Andersen seeing some duty as the
snapper in the shotgun. Bruce Armstrong returns as Drew Bledsoe's
main protector, and the line will have to establish itself to get
Kevin Faulk some running room.
</P>
<P>
   While dominance is expected from the defensive side, the
Patriots must prove their offensive might.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe is coming off a terrible second half last season, a
trend he'd like to stop immediately. He'll be looking to Terry
Glenn and Brown on shorter routes, which will allow the elusive
receivers to use their legs to gain yards. Look for Bledsoe to use
Faulk as a receiver on swing passes and screens, and he will
attempt to establish Tony Carter as an option in the flat. While
the tight ends have been silent, Bledsoe will attempt to get that
aspect of the offense going to either Eric Bjornson or Rod
Rutledge.
</P>
<P>
   Look for some trickery from offensive coordinator Charlie Weis.
It may not be Michael Bishop coming in on goal-line situations, but
the Patriots have shown enough reverses and options to keep the
Bucs off balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Charlie puts us in positions that are to our
advantage,'' said Brown. ``We're going to show different things.
We're not going to be predictable, but while the plays will be
exciting, the players have to get the job done. We've got to make
the plays that help us win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots didn't show the Bucs their various defensive looks
in the teams' exhibition game. There'll be more blitzing at
different times, on different downs, in an attempt to confuse Bucs
quarterback Shaun King.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy likely prepared for the Patriots by
watching some of Weis's tendencies with the Jets the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Belichick looked like a man who could barely keep his
eyes open as he addressed the media. While he's played down his
first game, his actions have spoken volumes. This means everything
to Belichick, to the Krafts, and to the fans who have bought into
the notion that a change in coaching staffs would create new hope.
</P>
<P>
   By 4 p.m., Belichick will know whether he got that across to his
team.

REVOLUTION CAN TASTE THE PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ The Revolution are closing in on a trip to the
playoffs for just the second time in Major League Soccer's five
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Their first appearance was in 1997, when they were eliminated in
two straight by D.C. United, the eventual MLS champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been three years since we went to the playoffs,'' said
midfielder Ted Chronopoulos. ``That's a vote of confidence. just to
get into the playoffs. Right now, though, we have to focus. I'm
concerned about our lack of luster.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have won three in a row, all at home, and hold a
12-11-6 record for 42 points. They nipped D.C. United, 1-0,
Wednesday despite being outshot, 6-2. There is a rematch Sunday
with D.C. United, who at 7-17-6 are out of playoff contention and
are missing 10 players because of injuries and World Cup
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a good team, and we need to keep going this
season,'' said Revolution first-year coach Fernando Clavijo. ``We
have to dictate our game and how we're playing right now. We have
to take that right into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Wolde Harris and defender Rusty Pierce will miss
Sunday's game. Harris, who tied an MLS record by scoring in seven
consecutive games and has 15 goals on the season, will be in
Jamaica for a World Cup qualifier. Pierce, meanwhile, sits out
because of too many caution points against him.
</P>
<P>
   So forward Eric Wynalda, who came to the Revolution from the
Miami Fusion July 8, is expected to make his first start (after
three appearances off the bench). Brian Dunseth, who sat out the
last three games, did not make the trip and will leave Monday to
join the US Olympic team in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us a chance to show we've got total depth,''
Revolution captain and midfielder John Harkes said. ``Wynalda has
been getting stronger, he's going to fit our needs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep doing what we're doing, taking one game at a time,
and focus on what we have to do each game, we can definitely win
our fourth straight, even though the last game against D.C. United
was a rough one but it picked up at the end,'' said rookie defender
Adam Eyre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a terrific experience, making the playoffs as
a rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United has a young team but is not without weapons,
especially on offense with forward A.J. Wood. He had two shots on
goal against New England Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put A.J. on another team as a starter, he'd be tough,''
said Harkes, who won three MLS Cups with D.C. United. ``He's one of
D.C.'s target guys. Any time I face my old club, I always think
it's something special. There's always that little bit that becomes
a bit personal.''

IT WAS BAD KARMA FROM THE START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. _ OK, Boston College fans. First the good news
from Mountaineer Field.
</P>
<P>
   It's all right. We'll wait.
</P>
<P>
   Still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go to Eagles coach Tom O'Brien, who was asked what he got
out of Saturday's 34-14 opening-game loss to West Virginia. ``A
giant headache,'' grumbled O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien had been more specific earlier. ``I think it was an
abysmal performance by the offense,'' he said. ``The worst I've
seen in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all of that, with broken assignments, fumbles, tipped
balls that turned into interceptions, all of which turned a 17-14
game going into the fourth quarter into a blowout that left the
Eagles to regroup for next week's game at Army.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien and the Eagles felt they could win Saturday, something
no BC team has done in Morgantown since 1990. They felt they were a
better team.
</P>
<P>
   But they also should have known something was amiss the minute
they left The Heights Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Their charter flight was late. They had to reload the plane for
better balance, and when they were ready to take off for
Pittsburgh, they were delayed by thunderstorms in the Pittsburgh
area.
</P>
<P>
   Things got worse when they came in for their approach and the
pilots detected some problems, which precipitated a runway greeting
of fire trucks and ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   For the Eagles' peace of mind, the pilots kept that information
to themselves until they landed safely.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of arriving at their hotel at 8 p.m. Friday night, the
Eagles got into their rooms closer to 11.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive unit, which was thought to be the team's strength,
never did arrive at Mountaineer Field.
</P>
<P>
   From the get-go, the Eagles looked like a team playing its first
game of the season. But with a veteran offensive line, a senior
quarterback in Tim Hasselbeck, and quality running backs in William
Green and Cedric Washington, O'Brien expected more. Much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried about the defense coming down here,'' he
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from a couple of busted plays on long passes, the
defense held its own, until a pair of Hasselbeck passes were
intercepted and returned for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case for most of what happened, the blame was not all
Hasselbeck's. A misread, a ball bouncing off Washington and into
the hands of West Virginia's Grant Wiley for the final touchdown of
the long, hot, miserable afternoon, were the punctuation marks on a
bad day, a bad weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than physical mistakes. There were other lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Eagles' first offensive series of the second half.
Trailing, 17-7, they had moved from their 22 to West Virginia's 42.
``We had the momentum,'' said O'Brien, who watched Green get
stopped on a third and 1.
</P>
<P>
   It looked close enough for a measurement. But the officials
wouldn't bring out the chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't say why,'' said O'Brien, who argued to see how
close BC was to a first down.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to blow a timeout early, and not quite sure how much
he needed, O'Brien went conservative and decided to punt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have gone for it if I had known how much we needed,''
said O'Brien, with logic that seemed a little shaky since the
distance was less than a yard.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the setback, the Eagles did go 71 yards in six plays
to close the margin to 17-14 as the fourth quarter started.
</P>
<P>
   But that was it. The bad karma that followed the Eagles since
they left campus Friday continued.
</P>
<P>
   On the first series of the fourth quarter, Shawn Hackett
intercepted a Hasselbeck pass at the BC 41 and raced to the end
zone for the score and a 10-point lead that would double in the
next 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On top of everything else, BC lost cornerback D.J. Sutton and
defensive tackle Antonio Garay with knee injuries in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Eagles, it didn't get any better after the
game. They were scheduled to pick up their charter in Clarksburg,
W.Va., only a 35-minute bus trip from the stadium, instead of the
hour-and-a-half trip back to Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck. The plane was in Clarksburg, but the flight
attendants were in Pittsburgh. So at 4:45 p.m. Saturday, the
Eagles' buses pulled away from Mountaineer Field heading back to
Pittsburgh, hopeful that a plane would be there to take them home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trip from hell,'' sighed BC athletic director Gene
DeFilippo as he prepared to begin the next leg of the journey.
</P>
<P>
   The scary part now is that there is a seed of doubt that this
could be the season from hell.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's only one game into a season, but Saturday's loss was
also a Big East loss. It was also a game the Eagles thought they
could win and probably should have won, although now there has to
be a question as to how good the Eagles' offense really is.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles should beat Army next week and Navy in two weeks.
Then they have a major challenge in Virginia Tech Sept. 30. That
should be followed by another win when they play host to UConn Oct.
7.
</P>
<P>
   The optimistic voices among the BC fans say the Eagles should be
no worse than 3-2 at that point.
</P>
<P>
   But 4-1 would sound nicer to O'Brien, and that still can happen.
But right now, O'Brien's main concern is to get his team to 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Monday is Labor Day, which is appropriate, since the workload
for the Eagles has increased significantly.

CURTAIN FALLS ON EAGLES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. _ If this show had opened on Broadway, it
would have closed after the first act. Boston College's 34-14 loss
to Big East foe West Virginia Saturday before a Mountaineer Field
crowd of 49,786 proved to be a flop for the Eagles from its flawed
start to its merciful conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   And there wasn't any need for a playbill in this one, either.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone on BC's supposed high-powered offense _ from fifth-year
quarterback Tim Hasselbeck to running back Cedric Washington to the
veteran receiving corps and mammoth offensive line _ shared equal
billing when it came to receiving blame for Saturday's debacle,
which seemed to be an eerie encore of BC's unsightly 62-28 loss to
Colorado in the Insight.com Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Playing as though it was still hung over from that New Year's
Eve bash in Tucson, BC's offense failed to live up to its billing
as the strength of this team and instead submitted a disappointing
206-yard effort riddled by five turnovers (two fumbles, three
interceptions), nine penalties for 43 yards, and lackluster
execution in a critical stretch in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was an abysmal performance by the offense,'' said
BC coach Tom O'Brien, whose team must straighten itself out before
its next game Saturday at Army. ``It was probably the worst I've
seen in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbeck had an uncharacteristic performance, looking as
though the first game of his senior year was the first of his
career. He completed 14 of 29 passes for 119 yards and threw a
4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Robert Ellis that pulled BC to
17-14 with 1:24 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   However, he was victimized by three interceptions: the first
killed BC's first possession; the second two killed any hopes of a
comeback when Shawn Hackett scored on a 41-yard return to make it
24-14 and Grant Wiley returned a bounced ball off Cedric Washington
for a 22-yard touchdown that gave the Mountaineers an
insurmountable 20-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really disappointing,'' Hasselbeck said of his
performance. ``You work hard all summer getting ready to have a
good opening game and then you have this happen. It's tough, really
tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something that's hard to swallow right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington also had a difficult time digesting the setback after
he gained 31 yards on 13 carries and was upstaged by sophomore
backup William Green, who rushed 10 times for 59 yards (including a
dazzling 34-yard run that set up BC's second touchdown).
</P>
<P>
   After Greg Toal recovered Ralph Parent's blocked punt at the
West Virginia 34, Green pulled the Eagles within 17-7 six plays
later when he scored on a 2-yard plunge with 1:26 remaining before
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   ``They changed up a couple of things on us,'' said Washington,
explaining why BC's offense managed only 79 yards rushing. ``But we
came out too soft. We weren't the same BC team that we were last
year (in a 34-17 victory at Alumni Stadium).''
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia's Avon Cobourne single-handedly outgained BC's
ballcarriers with 132 yards on 29 carries and a 2-yard scoring run
that helped the Mountaineers take a 10-0 lead in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper Rego (10 carries, 60 yards) added a 1-yard run that made
it 17-0.
</P>
<P>
   While the offense was mired in a struggle of its own, BC's young
and inexperienced defense slugged it out with the Mountaineers,
doing so minus two starters, defensive tackle Antonio Garay and
cornerback D.J. Sutton, who went down with knee injuries after the
first two series. Garay, who injured his left knee tackling
Cobourne on the game's first play, and Sutton, who reinjured the
right knee he had major surgery on two seasons ago, will undergo
MRIs Sunday at St. Elizabeth's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd get to the fourth quarter,'' O'Brien said. ``We
trained and conditioned ourselves to play that way and we got it
there, but we couldn't do anything from that point on. I think the
offensive turnovers kind of took the air out of our defense, but
they still hung in there and played and that's a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as the final score reflected, there were way too many
negatives for anyone to earn a rave review. If anything, Saturday's
season debut, which both teams had pointed to as an important
measuring stick, wound up being a sobering dose of reality for the
Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we came in here thinking we were too good. I
can't really say that, because I didn't think so,'' said senior
right guard and tricaptain Paul Zukauskas, explaining the offensive
line's ineffectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we had a big head, but maybe that's what it was.
Maybe we thought we were better than we were and we just played
soft, as an offensive line. We should be able to move some people
around, knock some people around, and be dominant _ but we got
dominated.''
</P>
<P>
   From the opening act to the final curtain.

TIBBETTS STILL ON THIN ICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The transaction didn't generate much buzz when it was announced
April 10. The Pittsburgh Penguins had signed Scituate native Billy
Tibbetts.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it seemed no big deal. There are dozens of
Massachusetts natives in the NHL. However, Tibbetts's rap sheet is
a very big deal. He played hockey at age 21 back in 1995-96,
recording 37 goals, 31 assists, and 300 penalty minutes in 58 games
with the Johnstown Chiefs of the East Coast Hockey League. He
hasn't played since because he was imprisoned _ in Massachusetts
Correctional Institution-Norfolk, a medium-security prison, from
which he was paroled on Oct. 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, 1994, Tibbetts pleaded guilty to raping a
15-year-old girl at a party. Tibbetts, who was 17 at the time of
the offense and 19 at the time of the sentencing, received a
suspended sentence of 3-5 years and four years of probation. A
month later, on April 27, he was charged with assault and battery
on a police officer, disorderly conduct, and intimidating a
witness. On July 12, 1995, he was charged with assault and battery
with a dangerous weapon in the form of a BB gun. That charge
eventually resulted in his probation being revoked and landed him
in prison for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he's rehabilitated, maybe he's turned his life around.
Maybe hard time scared him straight.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's 25 years old and 215 pounds, 40 of which he supposedly
added while incarcerated. He is considered by the Penguins to be a
good prospect. New England scout Neil Shea endorsed him, as did
Penguins assistant coach Joe Mullen and former NHLer Dave Silk, who
is said to be a friend of the Tibbetts family.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Craig Patrick has decided that Tibbetts deserves
a second chance at a career in hockey.
</P>
<P>
   The cynic in me is disgusted that someone with his track record
would be given any opportunity to become a professional athlete.
The liberal part of me says maybe he can become a community
influence in helping kids realize what is in store for them if they
make horrible decisions and run afoul of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing an NHL jersey is supposed to be a privilege, and the
idea of a convicted felon wearing one is repugnant. The NFL has
plenty of them, the NBA more than its share, and Major League
Baseball has supported the likes of Dwight Gooden, Steve Howe, and
Darryl Strawberry, who have sullied the game. The NHL has had some
players go astray _ most commonly battling alcohol _ but the sport
so far has had mostly good citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, Tibbetts has paid his debt to society and should be
allowed to get on with his life. However, you can't help but hold
your nose at the thought of Tibbetts in an NHL uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like saying, `How would you feel about having him live
down the street from you?' '' said Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe. ``The
reason we have a justice system is to do exactly that, serve
justice. If he's done his time, he's just as good as any other
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe acknowledged he didn't have the details of Tibbetts's
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm not going to try to credit a person like that
because he's obviously done wrong,'' he said. ``That's the league's
decision and the team's decision. That is a tough question. I've
got to admit, it was mentioned to me on the golf course and it did
surprise me that the league would give an opportunity in that
direction because there could be backlash from the media and fans
and even players.''
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, there already has been some fan backlash in
Pittsburgh, but apparently it wasn't enough of a ripple to cause
management to rethink its position. Dafoe said if Tibbetts winds up
making the Penguins, it will be business as usual, for the most
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in all honesty, once the puck is dropped, no one
really pays that much attention to it,'' he said. ``It's more what
you're going to read from different people's perspectives on it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drury still livin' a dream
</P>
<P>
   Former Boston University standout Chris Drury, who is coming off
back-to-back 20-goal performances his first two years with the
Colorado Avalanche, said he still finds it difficult to believe
he's on the same team as Ray Bourque. ``It was unbelievable,'' said
Drury. ``You get to the rink that first game and you see his
Avalanche jersey being made, the No. 77 and his name. Then watching
him get dressed and just everything he does and how he prepares. It
was unbelievable. It's something I never thought would happen. I
didn't really foresee me playing for the Bruins and I definitely
didn't see him playing anywhere else. It was a great thrill.'' . .
. Oilers forward Mike Grier said life without Glen Sather in
Edmonton will be different. The former Oilers GM, who made his move
to Broadway during the offseason, was highly regarded. ``All the
players really liked him,'' said Grier, another product of BU. ``He
was tough negotiating with, but everyone really got along with him
and everyone had a lot of respect for him. It definitely will be a
little different. I think Kevin (Lowe) will do a good job. He has
all the players' respect. A lot of us played with him a few years
ago and we know what kind of guy he is. He's straightforward and I
think he'll treat everyone fairly.'' . . . Bruins enforcer Ken
Belanger said he has no doubt that last year's debacle will
actually help the club's resilience in tough times. ``There were a
lot more downs than ups,'' said Belanger. ``We've got basically the
same nucleus back. When you go through a year like that, there
aren't more issues you can deal with, so I think if we run into any
problems this year, it won't be anything new. When it goes on now,
you say, `We had to go through it and we know how to deal with it.'
'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Yashin wound runs deep
</P>
<P>
   Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson said he'd offer an olive
branch to center Alexei Yashin, even though Yashin thumbed his nose
at the club last season and refused to honor the $3.6 million final
year of his contract. ``He would be welcomed back by most of the
guys, he's a good hockey player, and he's going to help any team,''
said Alfredsson. One Senator who likely wouldn't be thrilled to
have him back is Vaclav Prospal, who has publicly criticized
Yashin. Alfredsson admitted there is some division there. ``If he
was committed to play 100 percent and follow our system, we would
want him here,'' said Alfredsson. ``Of course, there would be (some
awkwardness), but there's nothing you can't talk about. You have to
play with open cards. In the long run, everyone wants to win.''
Speaking of Yashin, count former Bruin great Bobby Orr as among
those thinking Yashin should have honored his commitment. ``He
should be playing,'' said Orr, who was in Ottawa for a children's
hockey camp. ``My feeling is he has a contract and he should honor
it. It was good enough when he signed it, nobody held a gun to his
head. We (Woolf Associates) have never had a player try to do this.
But if we did, I'd strongly suggest he play out his contract. If
(Yashin) was playing poorly, he'd expect it to be honored.'' . . .
St. Louis Blues defenseman Chris Pronger is looking ahead to next
summer, when he becomes a restricted free agent. Pronger, who won
the Hart Trophy as the league's MVP as well as the Norris Trophy as
the top defenseman, is in the last year of a deal that paid him
$3.425 million in base salary last year. Reportedly, Pronger is
looking for $8 million-$10 million a season . . . Defenseman Bryan
Berard, who nearly lost his right eye five months ago after being
struck by the stick of Ottawa's Marian Hossa March 11, plans to get
back on skates and may even practice with the Toronto Maple Leafs.
``He wants to talk to Pat (Quinn, the Maple Leafs' general manager
and coach),'' said Berard's agent, Tom Laidlaw. ``The Leafs have
been tremendous to him and he doesn't want this to become a
distraction. He's very conscious of the team and he doesn't want to
be a disruption or for there to be the daily Bryan Berard update.
If that's the case, then he'll skate on his own.'' It appeared
highly unlikely that Quinn would sanction a practice appearance.
Eye specialist Dr. Stanley Chang, based in New York, told the
player his vision will not get better or worse, and his sight will
be severely limited. Whether he will be able to play again remains
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brashear fights for his share
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't appear Canucks forward Donald Brashear will be in
camp. He and the club seem far apart on a deal. ``They have just
downloaded a lot of money because of guys like (Alex) Mogilny and
Mark Messier,'' said Brashear. ``There should be some there for
me.'' Reportedly, Canucks GM Brian Burke is prepared to use rookie
Mike Brown in the enforcer role if Brashear isn't signed. ``Brian
Burke likes to use the media for his negotiations,'' Brashear
asserted. ``If that's the type of player he wants to have, then he
can just go with Mike Brown _ if he just wants an average player.
(Or he can have) a player who makes the team grow 2 inches, someone
who can go into corners, score some goals.'' Brashear had 11 goals
in 60 games last year, along with 136 penalty minutes. He made
$750,000 and reportedly wants more than double that . . . Former
Bruins defenseman Garry Galley, 37, has moved his family back to
his native Ottawa and awaits word on whether he will play a 17th
NHL season. Galley, who had 30 points (9 goals) in 70 games for the
Los Angeles Kings last season, rejected an offer of $750,000 to
re-sign. ``I had a great three years in LA,'' said Galley, who made
$1.8 million last year. ``I'm just disappointed in the way things
ended. I've always known this was a business. I just think things
could have been handled differently by (GM) Dave Taylor. He's a
friend of mine. I played with him.'' Galley said some teams have
expressed interest but so far, no hard offers. ``Maybe I need
somebody to tell me that I can't do it anymore. Right now, I'm
preparing like I'm going to play, but if I don't hear from anybody
by mid-September, then I'll just retire and move on in life.'' It
seems to me there are a number of teams with young defensemen who
could do a whole lot worse than having Galley help bring them along
. . . The Bruins will hold their annual fan party outside the
Ristuccia Center in Wilmington next Saturday and Sunday (weather
permitting) from 8 a.m.-1 p.m. There will be players signing
autographs as well as games and prizes. Bruins tickets go on sale
at the FleetCenter box office next Saturday (Sept. 9) from 10
a.m.-2 p.m. Former Bruin great Terry O'Reilly will sign autographs
from 10-11. Fans purchasing tickets will receive gifts. Buying
three, four, or five games also gets you discounts at the pro shop.
Tickets also are available at BostonBruins.com, TicketMaster
outlets, or by calling (508 or 617) 931-2222 . . . Training camp
opens this week. Ready or not, here it comes.

LINEBACKER MUST BE A PATIENT HEALER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Finally, Ted Johnson is realistic about what the
Injury Fates have hurled at him. In the past, he would fight his
plight, rue his luck, rush to be back in the rush that has
energized him so much _ the rush of playing football.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Johnson is almost indispensable to the Patriots' defense.
Especially against a team like Sunday's opponent, the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers and their punishing fullback Mike Alstott, the New
England inside linebacker would be the ideal chess piece for coach
Bill Belichick to move here and there, always ready to pounce on
Alstott and stymie a Tampa Bay drive.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the case has been for more than two years, it is unclear
when he will be back to being the Ted Johnson who was one of the
most promising young linebackers in the NFL after his first four
years. Now, Johnson is in his sixth year and once again waiting for
his body to tell him it's ready to play the only way Johnson can
play. Fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it's going to be,'' Johnson said of his new
pacifist approach toward the injuries (shoulders, biceps, pectoral
muscle, and now a hamstring) that have forced him to undergo four
operations and miss 14 of the 19 games since he tore a muscle
against Pittsburgh late in the 1998 season. ``From the experiences
I've been through, I've learned that you have to surrender to it.
That's been my path the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Season openers bring out cloaks and daggers in every NFL
stadium. So it is unclear how much Johnson will play Sunday, and
certainly how well. After all, he missed the entire exhibition
season with a new curse from the injury gods: this time a shot to
his lower body, a hamstring pull early in camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to draw it up a little differently, I certainly would
have,'' Johnson said of the endless frustration of the recent
injuries. ``But I can't. That's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will say, ``I learned a lot the last few years, learned
a lot about myself, and learned that I haven't handled these
situations in the right way. I'm trying to handle it better this
time around, realizing that things are out of my control. I'd like
things to be different but they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, this was not Johnson's approach. He has such a
fierce passion for playing football that he simply could not accept
the fact that he could not play football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd put a lot of pressure on myself,'' he said. ``I'd put
undue pressure on myself. I wasn't a fun guy to live with. And I
probably wasn't a good teammate, in supporting guys and stuff. But,
from this experience, I've learned this is the way it's going to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Johnson's best friends is Todd Collins, the linebacker
with the Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams and a former teammate
of Johnson's with the Patriots. And if Patriot fans still rue that
Bobby Grier and Pete Carroll did not do more to keep Collins,
Johnson rues it even more.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Collins has been a huge aid to Johnson, the two talking
often. And, Johnson readily conceded, Collins has been instrumental
in helping him find a new attitude with which to approach his
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking to Todd has really been helpful,'' said Johnson.
``Todd's been injured at several points throughout his career and
he told me how he's dealt with it. And Todd always has such a great
outlook, always upbeat about his whole life, and especially how
he's played football. And I learned a lot just talking to Todd.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, his new/old coach, clearly remembers how instrumental
Johnson was to the turnaround in the New England defense in the
1996 season that eventually led to a Super Bowl appearance. And
while Belichick deflected direct questions about Johnson's status
last week with some humor (``On a personal level, I've never had a
pulled muscle because I never ran fast enough to pull one''), the
coach conceded that Johnson's injury woes have been
``unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether Johnson's injuries might be caused, in part, by
over-training, Belichick said, ``I don't think there is any good
explanation for it. Certainly none of our medical people have one.
The way I look at it and the way I talk to Ted about it this year,
hopefully he has got them out of the way. Nobody works harder than
Ted does. Nobody is more diligent. Nobody trains harder. I can't
explain.''
</P>
<P>
   And Johnson no longer tries to, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough because you put so much of your self-worth and
identity into a game and your job,'' said Johnson. ``And when
you're not able to perform, you kind of have somewhat of an
identity crisis. So it is very difficult and you just have to keep
it in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   It is natural to wonder, though, since Johnson tore a biceps in
the first scrimmage of the 1999 season, and pulled his hamstring in
one of the early drills of the 2000 camp ``when I was just pursuing
the ball.'' Routine plays, both times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to do that, wonder why it happened the way it did,''
said Johnson. ``No more. Now, it's the way it is.''

KEYSHAWN WOULD LOVE TO BE HATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was close to midnight when Keyshawn Johnson _ who had already
been on the phone for 90 minutes _ finally began to yawn. This was
after he had spoken of Terry Glenn, Bill Parcells, the 1992 Los
Angeles riots, Bryant Gumbel, Tiger Woods, linen suits, Johnny
Most, Al Groh, Willie McGinest, Pete Carroll, dogged defenses, Bill
Belichick, and Greg Kite.
</P>
<P>
   This was after the 6-foot-4-inch athlete nicknamed ``Key'' had
traveled to Orlando and back on his day off. This was after his
4-year-old daughter, who was waking from an evening nap, told him
she needed food. And it was after he tried to put Pedro Martinez's
one-hitter against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in perspective. ``Come
on, man,'' he said. ``It's the Devil Rays! What do you expect?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, football's Original Key of Comedy, was tired. But there
was one thing he had to know before going to bed. ``Hey,'' he said,
``who do y'all hate up there in New England? I mean, who are your
villains when it comes to sports?''
</P>
<P>
   He was told of the collective villains from New York, Montreal,
and Los Angeles. He considered the information and stopped short of
asking if he, too, could be placed on the Loathsome List. But it's
obvious he wants the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it up there,'' Johnson said. ``You've got the whole
stadium screaming, `Keyshawn sucks.' I like that. It lets me know
that I have arrived. It lets me know that they really do love me.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I caught a pass there and everyone booed. It was
funny. But it's pretty much like that in all the AFC East cities,
and I can understand why. I've done so much work in the division
and a lot of fans are frustrated. When we played at Miami in the
preseason and they introduced me, everyone booed. It was like I was
John Rocker or something. How many games have I played in New
England in my career? Four? I did work in all four of them, didn't
I?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will make his fifth trip to Foxboro Stadium Sunday. He
promises the results against the Patriots will be the same _ ``I'm
going to do what I normally do; please tell Willie McGinest not to
take it personally'' _ even if his team has changed. He is no
longer a despised New York Jet. He is now a receiver for the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers, a team once known for its exaggerated neon-lamp
fashion and numbing (26 in a row) losing streak. Now, instead of
losing stars such as Steve Young and Bo Jackson, they are
accumulating ones such as Johnson for a run at the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Their newest star says he will enter the stadium wearing a
stylish suit. ``It won't be linen because it wrinkles too easily,''
he explained. He says he will take the field, see his old buddies
(McGinest, Belichick, Ty Law), punch the clock, and go to work as a
crowd of 60,000 heckles him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can the Patriots do against me? They may roll some
coverages to my side, and things like that. But what else? Step on
my big toe and hope that slows me down? Everybody knows that the
only way you can stop me is if you stop my quarterback. They can
use any defense they want. Defense is irrelevant when my team wants
to get me the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   As Johnson speaks, you wonder why television producers haven't
caught up with him yet. Yes, he has been featured on all the sports
programs. But what about ``Politically Incorrect''? Why hasn't
someone figured out a way to make him a questioner in one of the
Bush-Gore debates? Give the 28-year-old Johnson 10 minutes to talk
about anything and someone will certainly walk away either
blushing, gasping, or laughing.
</P>
<P>
   On coaches who scream: ``It's the new millennium, man. It ain't
the 1970s and '80s. You can't do that screaming stuff anymore as a
coach. After a while, a guy is going to pop you in your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jets coach Groh: ``If he sees me, I'd advise him not to
extend his hand (for a handshake). Basically, he'll be standing
there by himself with his hand out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Patriots receiver Glenn: ``Why do y'all talk so bad about
Terry Glenn up there? I like Terry. I don't think he's soft. Look,
everybody can't be hard-nosed like me.''
</P>
<P>
   On his new coach, Tony Dungy: ``He's as cool as the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   On critics who claim golfer Woods is not ``ethnic'' enough:
``Why don't they leave him alone? People have to understand that
he's not like me. He ain't a thugged-out, from-the-projects,
government-cheese-eating type of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   On his critics: ``I'm an outspoken, young, black athlete who is
successful. A lot of people don't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   On a little-known aspect of Parcells's coaching: ``Bill didn't
do as much screaming and yelling as you think.''
</P>
<P>
   On former New England coach Carroll: ``He'll get a head job
again. The NFL has the old-boy network going. All he has to do is
be somebody's defensive coordinator for a couple years. The defense
will be decent, and the phone calls will come. Works every time.''
</P>
<P>
   That verbal style, filled with candor and frequent flirtations
with the outrageous, made Johnson a perfect fit for New York, even
if he is trying to convince everyone that Tampa is his style, too.
He said he likes being around ``(Warren) Sapp and all the other
guys here,'' enjoys Jet Skiing and, despite his dig at them,
tolerates the sad Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   But it's difficult to imagine Johnson out of the AFC. He used to
spend hours talking about his matchups with talented cornerbacks
such as Law, Sam Madison, and Shawn Springs. Last season, he put
pressure on himself by saying he envisioned touchdowns every time
Steve Israel was across from him. At the time, he also said the
Patriots were too smart to leave Tebucky Jones on him without a
chaperone.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson won't have that now. The Buccaneers don't have ancient,
geographical rivals, as the Jets do. His new team plays in a
division in which Green Bay hates Chicago and Minnesota hates
Detroit and all of them rotate on a cold-weather axis. Then there
is warm Tampa, the displaced Central Florida member of the Black
and Blue Division. And while Johnson once argued, incredibly, that
New York could be boring, what is he going to make of Florida's
west coast?
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make a man miss New York. Isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I could care less about what the Jets are doing,'' Johnson
said. ``If reporters didn't ask me about them, I wouldn't talk
about them. Since I watch all sports on TV, I see them when they
are on the highlights, but it's not like I'm on the Internet trying
to keep up with them. A lot of people hear me say that and think,
`Oh, he's (expletive) me.' But I'm serious. I don't think about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he believes the decision to trade him was Groh's,
not Parcells's. The Jets traded him for two first-round picks,
mostly because they feared Johnson would have issues with his
contract. It looked good when he signed it in 1996, but compared
with Joey Galloway's, Johnson's deal made him feel underpaid. He
was asked why he didn't plan to honor a contract that he signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, don't give me that (expletive),'' he said. ``You know a
contract is not a contract. What happened up there with Bruce
Armstrong and Vincent Brisby? They got cut. At the time, no one
said, `Hey, the team can't do that. Those guys had contracts.'
</P>
<P>
   ``No one says that when coaches leave a team so they can make
more money somewhere else. You've got owners who threaten to leave
town unless they get a new stadium. And when they do, all you hear
is commentators say, `It was a great political move. They didn't
want to give the guy his own stadium, so he had to do something.'
Please. Don't give me that (expletive) about a contract I signed. I
wish fans would look at the whole picture when they talk about
money in sports.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, the yawn came. The man who aspires to be a New
England villain, the same man who acknowledges his involvement in
the riots that made Rodney King famous (``I'm from South-Central
LA; everyone there was involved''), was ready to sleep. But before
he hung up the phone, a familiar, raspy voice came across the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Bird steals the ball! He passes to DJ!''
</P>
<P>
   Keyshawn Johnson was doing his Johnny Most impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was that guy's name? The broadcaster?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most, he was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah. Johnny Most. I remember him. I was into all the
Celtics-Lakers stuff in the '80s. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I
believe we beat y'all in two out of three series in the '80s. And
we're about to get a few more with Shaq. What are the Celtics going
to do? Maybe y'all should bring in Robert Parish to coach. Or maybe
Greg Kite.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed, and just to make sure his To Be Disliked in New
England application was being taken seriously, he issued a warning
to Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him that our front seven is no joke. We got all
Rottweilers in that front seven. We're going to be sending Bledsoe
a message, and it won't be a subliminal one. He had better be ready
for the heat we're going to put on him.''
</P>
<P>
   When he hung up the phone, he had to know the job of being hated
was his. He won't have to make any follow-up calls to confirm it;
Sunday in Foxborough, nearly 60,000 people will call him.

SEPTEMBER GIVES NEW MEANING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is it these guys are always saying? ``I want to play in
games that mean something.'' Isn't that it?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's September, and this game meant something. The Seattle
Mariners have a shaky lead in the American League West and the Red
Sox are, somewhat inexplicably, still hanging around in the
wild-card race (only pathetically incurable optimists are thinking
about the Yankees). And so, yes, this game most definitely had
meaning for both clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed it,'' sighed embattled Seattle skipper Lou Piniella,
whose team has played very bad baseball for almost a month. ``We
need to start winning games like this. We need to get our
confidence back.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny things can happen in September. Rosters expand and
managerial options increase. Opportunities that did not present
themselves a week ago pop up, and so one of the key junctures in
the 4-1 Seattle victory was a confrontation between a veteran
lefthanded pitcher and a righthanded batter who, almost without
question, was unknown to the southpaw before he saw him brandishing
that bat some 60 feet 6 inches away.
</P>
<P>
   The lefty was Rheal Cormier and the batter was Brian Lesher, who
is one of those proverbial and ubiquitous callups baseball allows
in the month of September. Other sports limit their rosters as the
season goes on. But baseball expands. It makes no sense, but there
are many things about baseball that make even less sense, and
that's a topic for some future journalistic rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here was Lesher, fresh from Tacoma (25 homers, 92 runs
batted in), up there against Cormier with Mark McLemore on first
base with two away in the seventh inning of a scoreless game. Make
that a scoreless September/pennant race game. The count ran to
3-and-2 when Lesher ripped one to right. Trot Nixon made a critical
move in, and then was unable to catch up with the ball, as it
rolled to the fence for a run-producing triple.
</P>
<P>
   Lesher also doubled in two nice insurance runs in the ninth.
That's the stuff September games are very often made of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a dream last night, right?'' joked Piniella. ``Brian
Lesher. That was a big day for that young man. He got us ahead with
a triple and got us further ahead with the double.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was a W for the struggling Mariners and an aggravating L
for the Red Sox since the Indians were busy losing to the Orioles.
It was a major lost opportunity, all the more so because the Red
Sox were unable to take proper advantage of a heroic pitching
performance by Ramon Martinez, whose first start since returning
from the disabled list was a very impressive 5 1/3 innings of
scoreless baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon looked like the Ramon people were pegging for 15 wins
before the season. His first four innings were downright
spectacular, considering that this was his first start since July
31. He breezed through the Mariners on an economical 49 pitches,
giving up two hits in those first four while walking two and
hitting one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw the ball a lot better than he did when we saw him
earlier this season,'' Piniella observed. ``He had a much better
change-up, and he had command of his fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   He showed signs of mortality in the fifth, when he started
falling behind people and running longer counts, but he was bailed
out following a two-out walk to McLemore when Jason Varitek threw
the Mariner second baseman out stealing on a pitchout. After
retiring the leadoff man in the sixth he went walk, hit batsman,
walk, and Jimy Williams decided that Ramon had gone far enough.
Hipolito Pichardo came in to get Carlos Guillen on a foul pop
(Manny Alexander making a nice catch with one foot in the Seattle
dugout) and Mike Cameron on a swinging third strike.
</P>
<P>
   It was a very heartening performance, one that guarantees Ramon
a second start against the Twins on Thursday. If he were to remain
in the rotation he could get as many as six more starts in the busy
month of September. And if he pitches like that, he might even win
a few.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that presupposes that the Red Sox could actually
score a few runs, and no one on earth can guarantee that. The team
that is 12th in the American League when it comes to scoring runs
managed just three hits and one run off Freddy Garcia Saturday. The
only thing that kept Mr. Garcia from blanking the Red Sox during
his seventh inning stint was an errant changeup that Troy O'Leary
knocked over the farthest spot in the Red Sox bullpen for his 11th
homer. Other than that, the Red Sox were offensively impotent, and
not for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   It really is an amazing thing that the Red Sox remain in
wild-card contention when you examine their non-Everett offense.
Remove Mr. Carl Everett and his 33 homer/99 RBI totals from the
lineup and they could easily be looking up at both Tampa Bay and
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   What is it, for example, with Nomar Garciaparra? If you didn't
know better, you'd think there was some sort of media conspiracy to
suppress the information that the great shortstop has now gone 14
games without driving in a run, and that he has knocked in only
nine runs since very early August. Time was when every Nomar out
was a hard one. No longer. He did hit one ball on the screws (a
ninth-inning liner to center), but most of his recent at-bats have
produced either singles or soft outs.
</P>
<P>
   In a lineup where third base is a black hole and people such as
O'Leary and Jason Varitek are not producing as they did last year,
Nomar remains, along with Everett, one of the two key sources of
power and run production. That the team remains afloat with him not
driving in a run for two weeks is utterly mystifying. It's a
tribute to something.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the absolutely unflappable optimism of the manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come to the ballpark every day believing we're going to
score runs,'' affirmed Williams. He may be the only one.
</P>
<P>
   But they do hang, don't they? They struggle to score, but
they've got Pedro every fifth day and they've got that bullpen and
they do not get discouraged. Friday night they found a way to win a
game in which nothing much was happening in the way of offense.
Saturday, they couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that if you look at their everyday lineup compared
with the everyday lineup of every one of their competitors there is
no comparison. Good Lord, in Cleveland Jim Thome often bats
seventh. You know who batted seventh for Jimy Saturday? Manny
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that it's Labor Day weekend and for these two
teams the games mean still something. And help can come from
somewhere. Saturday, Brian Lesher. Today, who knows? Izzy, maybe.

A BETTER STRETCH FOR RIGHTHANDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a little different from his last start. Ramon Martinez
pitched only one inning July 31 when he allowed five runs on five
walks and only one hit _ a grand slam by Jay Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   After that outing, the Red Sox righthander was placed on the
15-day disabled list with a right knee contusion.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Martinez lasted quite a bit longer in his return. He
went 5 1/3 innings, allowing just two hits and no runs. He walked
four, struck out three, and hit two batters in Seattle's 4-1
victory.
</P>
<P>
   He breezed through the first five innings before running into
difficulty in the sixth. With one out, Martinez walked shortstop
Alex Rodriguez, hit Edgar Martinez, and walked Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, manager Jimy Williams had seen enough. Martinez
was replaced by Hipolito Pichardo, who kept the Mariners off the
board by getting Carlos Guillen to foul out to third baseman Manny
Alexander and then striking out Mike Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I had good command of my changeup, and my fastball was
moving pretty good, too,'' said Martinez. ``It was my change that I
was most pleased with, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez paid close attention to slowing down his mechanics and
watching where he released his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been rushing my pitches before, not throwing the way I
should have been so it's been something that I've been working on
quite a bit, just being more positive,'' he said. ``And it's helped
in my changeup as well as slider.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, he was pleased with his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a while since I pitched like that,'' he said. ``I
haven't felt that way in a couple of weeks, I felt real good. I
felt better as the game went on, and I was able to get it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez pitched two games with Pawtucket during his
rehabilitation. He was 1-0 with a 2.31 ERA in 11 2/3 innings with
the PawSox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about the first or second inning when I was on
the mound. I just went out and threw strikes, just getting the guys
out,'' he said. ``To me, it was just another game. I feel very
strong right now. I feel I can help the team this next month, I
feel we're going to do better as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, Martinez felt he had gone as far as he
could go.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit Martinez, I didn't even know Rodriguez was stealing
on the pitch,'' he said. ``I was just making a high inside pitch on
the play, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez knows he will be needed down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of games, so we have to play hard this
month,'' he said. ``But after five weeks out, I feel 100 percent
back. I think I can help the team. I'm sure I can pitch the way I
want to. My arm is so much better now.''

SOX GET BOGGED DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has a cartoon character's nickname, an opera singer's girth,
and a commoner's humility.
</P>
<P>
   But he no longer has a Rocky Marciano record. El Guapo will ride
again, but for the first time all season, he was shot off his
horse.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox reliever Rich Garces, who had gone 13 months without a
defeat, took the loss in a 4-1 decision to the Seattle Mariners, a
first-place team that has been playing like a cellar-dweller for
more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Losers of 15 of their last 18 games, the Mariners parlayed hits
by Brian Lesher, a September call-up, and a home run by Edgar
Martinez, who had gone almost as long without a hit against the Sox
as Garces had gone without a loss, to even this four-game series at
a game apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The loss, which came after a 1-hour-44-minute rain delay,
dropped the Sox six games behind the Yankees in the American League
East, their biggest deficit of the season. They remained a game
behind Cleveland in the wild-card race, as the Indians lost to the
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember Lesher,'' said manager Jimy Williams of the
29-year-old minor league journeyman who tripled off Rheal Cormier
to break a scoreless tie in the seventh, then delivered an 0-and-2,
two-run double off Garces to make it 4-1 in the ninth. ``I wish I
remember facing Lesher.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesher is the son of a professional basketball player in
Belgium, which explains how he came to be born in Antwerp.
Originally drafted by the Oakland A's, he signed as a minor league
free agent with the Mariners and was leading their Triple A Tacoma
club with 25 home runs and 92 RBIs when he was summoned by the big
club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard of him, except in the pitchers' meeting,''
Garces said. ``But he just reached out with those long arms of his
and got a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez, of course, needs no introduction. The Mariners'
designated hitter leads the American League in RBIs with 128, but
he began the afternoon hitless in 20 at-bats against the Sox this
season. He broke that streak with a fourth-inning single off Ramon
Martinez, one of just two hits the righthander allowed before
loading the bases on two walks and a hit batsman in the sixth and
being replaced by Hipolito Pichardo with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Pichardo danced out of that jam, with Manny Alexander catching
Carlos Guillen's pop on the lip of the visitors' dugout and Mike
Cameron going down on strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the seventh, after Pichardo made a nice barehanded pickup
of Joe Oliver's roller and Nomar Garciaparra ranged to the
right-field side of second base for the first two outs, Mark
McLemore singled to left. That brought up Lesher, pinch hitting for
Al Martin, and brought Cormier out of the bullpen. Lesher caught
right fielder Trot Nixon taking one step in the wrong direction and
the opposite-field liner went over Nixon's head and McLemore scored
the first run of the game. Lesher wound up on third.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Garces made his entrance, which began auspiciously
when he retired Alex Rodriguez on a popup to Mike Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary then tied the score in the bottom of the seventh
with a home run over the Red Sox bullpen, his first in 15 games and
just his second in his last 38 games.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners starter Freddy Garcia, who allowed just three hits in
seven innings, had retired 13 straight until O'Leary took him deep.
</P>
<P>
   It was tied, 1-1, when Martinez led off the eighth by driving an
0-and-1 pitch from Garces onto the tarp in center field, 418 feet
away. The Mariners padded that lead in the ninth when Joe Oliver
singled, McLemore walked, and Lesher belted a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox put two runners on with walks in the ninth, but Kazuhiro
Sasaki, the Mariners' rookie closer from Japan, induced Dante
Bichette to tap into a force play, and O'Leary flied to right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said this before, you knew I wasn't always going to
win,'' said Garces (8-1), who had won 13 consecutive decisions
dating back to Aug. 2, 1999, a streak that tied for third longest
in Sox history (with Ellis Kinder and Ike Delock), behind only
Roger Clemens (14) and Smoky Joe Wood (16 in 1912).
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out there to do the job I've been doing the whole year,
but it was just a bad day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to say those were good hits. You're talking about
Edgar Martinez, who is a good hitter, one of the best hitters in
baseball. I've had some other bad days, but they've turned around.
Bases loaded, a couple of runs, and El Guapo wins the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll be back tomorrow. Nothing hurts. I'm still alive.''

SHEA NOW HOME SWEET MADHOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While the New York Mets chase the Atlanta Braves
in the National League East, there's much more on the line than
just a division title.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a collapse by either squad, one will be the league's
wild card. But the division winner would have home-field advantage,
and that could be enormous for the Mets, who entered Saturday half
a game ahead of the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that Yankee Stadium was a madhouse and Shea
Stadium was family-oriented. But that's changing.
</P>
<P>
   Shea's crowd became an issue last season with Atlanta's John
Rocker during the playoffs last season, but it's been intense this
season. In a recent series with Arizona, Jay Bell had to be
restrained by manager Buck Showalter after a fan heckled him. Randy
Johnson then lasted 2 innings. The next day, fans pounded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the typical Yankee fan is a Wall Street guy who's just
had dinner at The Palm (Steak House),'' Mets lefty Al Leiter said.
``That's not your typical Met fan. ... It was really nasty (with
Johnson). They said, 'We kicked your (butt), you freak. We got you.
We'll get you again.' That has to get in a player's head, no matter
how much he denies it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lead the major leagues with 47 home wins. Besides the
crowd, there's also the swirling winds, the home-field advantage
and the noisy jets flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It's) what we consider normal,'' Mets first baseman Todd
Zeile said. ``Other teams come in here already hating this place,
and that negative thought is in their heads. For us, we've gotten
used to it. We love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Minty fresh, tartar control: While chasing Roger Maris' home run
record, Mark McGwire successfully waded through the constant
barrage of stupid questions and inane topics from scribes searching
for the angle to his life story not yet covered.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Rockies first baseman Todd Helton, trying to become the
first player to bat .400 since Ted Williams in 1941, is learning
about the scrutiny. When about 20 writers showed up last week, they
asked him about superstitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts from when I get in the morning,'' said Helton,
batting .393. ``Most of it has to do with, this is going to sound
really crazy, what I do in the bathroom. Whether I use a wash cloth
to bathe with. Or if I brush my teeth in the shower or out of the
shower. Where I put the shampoo bottle. It depends on how we're
doing, the team.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Mark: Mark Wohlers, the one-time Atlanta closer who was
overwhelming until an anxiety disorder made it nearly impossible
for him to throw a strike, is doing fine for Cincinnati. But before
he got there, he also had to overcome ``Tommy John'' surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers, who is 1-2 with a 1.95 ERA in 13 games, pitched at
Atlanta's Turner Field and came through it a little better than he
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a lot more comfortable than I thought I would be,''
Wohlers said. ``When I pitched against them in Cincinnati (on Aug.
7), I was a little bit more nervous. ... But it (pitching in
Atlanta) was still pretty emotional. I still have a lot of good
friends over there, a lot of guys I played with for an awfully long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton talk: Perhaps the marquee free-agent pitcher will be
Mets lefty Mike Hampton, who the Dodgers will pursue heavily. That
is, if Hampton makes it to free agency. The Mets will try to
re-sign him after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think our chances of signing Mike have been
enhanced by the kind of success we're having as a team,'' Mets GM
Steve Phillips said. ``Mike's fitting here, and the team has played
well. It goes hand in hand. But do I have any idea which way Mike
is leaning? No, I don't.''

U.S. WATER POLO TEAMS SEEK FORMER GLORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ John Vargas and Guy Baker are used to having their
high expectations fulfilled. The same cannot be said for U.S. water
polo teams at recent Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. again has medal aspirations. Vargas and Baker, the
coaches, don't know any other way than to raise the bar high. Plus,
pre-Olympic competitions support the claims U.S. water polo is
returning to the level that produced two Olympic silver medals
during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stay focused, I don't see why not,'' said Vargas, the
men's coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone there will be tough,'' said Baker, the women's coach.
``But we should be right there with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for championship games is something both coaches do
frequently. As a coach at Corona del Mar High, Vargas has led his
boys' teams to berths in nine Southern Section finals, including
five championships. One of his girls' teams also reached the final.
</P>
<P>
   Baker coached both UCLA's men's and women's teams to national
championships during 1999-2000 and has won at least one national
title each year since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the three players who played for him at UCLA,
Baker has standouts in defender Julie Swail and playmaker Brenda
Villa.
</P>
<P>
   When summer began, Baker's team was rarely mentioned as a
serious contender in the inaugural six-team women's field, but that
changed in July at the Holiday Cup. The U.S. won the tournament
that featured all six Olympic teams.
</P>
<P>
   Australia was supposed to be the favorite, but a 12-save
performance by former Bruin Nicolle Payne helped the U.S. win 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a lot of confidence,'' said Coralie Simmons,
another former UCLA player who was named the tournament's Most
Valuable Offensive Player. ``You have to go by how you're playing,
and right now, we're playing pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can cause a lot of havoc for some teams. We've been
playing well and we'll try to bring it all together again at the
Olympics. If we do, I don't think we'll be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas got a taste of disappointment the past two Olympics, as a
player in 1992 and an assistant coach in `96.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans finished fourth in 1992, a year after taking the
gold at the prestigious FINA World Cup, which was held in the same
location as the Olympics. In 1996, the U.S. finished seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas returned the team to its winning ways when he led the
U.S. men to gold at the 1999 Pan American Games in his first year
as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks several games will be decided by one point at the
Olympics, so he is stressing the importance of conditioning and
staying focused to capitalize on that one deciding break.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to win the U.S.'s first medal since 1988 is a mixture of
youth (led by driver Tony Azevedo and 2-meter man Sean Kern and
veterans such as goalkeeper Dan Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Kern sparked UCLA's national championship last year. Azevedo is
entering his freshman year at Stanford after being a three-time
All- American at Long Beach Wilson High and becoming the youngest
player to make the U.S. national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the talent,'' Vargas said.

OPTIMISTIC NOTES, BUT THE SAME SONG FOR SLUGGISH TEXAS A&AMP;M
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ Like the prime-time quarterback he is forever
seeking to develop, Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum sensed the rush
coming. He stepped up and met the question before it met him.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum decreed that Mark Farris, the Aggies' latest edition
under center, would be judged by one simple yardstick: wins and
losses, not fancy statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, we've not been able to get much out of those
guys,'' Slocum said, words dripping with sarcasm. ``If we can just
get him to win, we'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, there should be little joy in Aggieland
after Saturday's 24-10 loss to a Notre Dame team coming off the
school's first losing season since 1986. Farris had his moments. So
did tailback Richard Whitaker and wide receiver Robert Ferguson, a
pair of promising newcomers on an offense that showed far more
imagination and explosive potential than at any point during A&AMP;M's
disappointing 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line proved painfully familiar to Aggies
faithful: one touchdown scored, another road loss collected. For
those counting at home, A&AMP;M has lost five times in its past six
trips to an opponent's home stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies' inability to win on the road, as well as Slocum's
inability to develop a top-flight quarterback, has become a
recurring theme for this team. Both trends surfaced, once again, in
Saturday's season opener. Both were answered with mixed reviews on
a day when No. 25 A&AMP;M seemed in control of everything but the
scoreboard at Notre Dame Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Take out a dropped pass here, a blown coverage there, and the
Aggies win going away.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, you can't remove Chris Taylor's third-quarter drop
of a perfect Farris toss that could have _ should have _ resulted
in a game-turning, 92-yard touchdown strike and a 17-7 lead in the
third quarter. Even though Farris, who completed 16 of 28 passes
for 165 yards, displayed big-play potential on occasion, his final
line showed more interceptions (one) and sacks (two) than touchdown
passes (none).
</P>
<P>
   Nor can you overlook a pair of blown coverages that allowed
Arnaz Battle, Notre Dame's scattershooting quarterback, to complete
consecutive passes in a second-quarter drive that revived a
clinically dead offense. The resulting touchdown produced a 7-7
deadlock at intermission and laid the groundwork for a second-half
rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept thinking we were in position to take control of the
game,'' said Slocum, whose team led, 10-7, until going
three-and-out on three consecutive possessions that coincided with
Notre Dame scoring drives of 44, 69 and 43 yards. ``But there were
key plays we didn't make. And you don't get many opportunities in a
game like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst part, said linebacker Brian Gamble, was the Aggies'
inability to rise to the occasion in crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like they dominated us. We controlled the game,
except for two or three plays,'' Gamble said. ``But you've got to
have that killer instinct to finish it off and we didn't. That
always makes you want to cuss.''
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, newcomers Farris, Whitaker (13 carries, 71 yards)
and Ferguson (five catches, 79 yards) showed enough promise to
suggest this offense could catch fire in the coming weeks and carry
A&AMP;M into contention in the Big 12 South Division. On the other, the
Aggies failed twice in pivotal, short-yardage situations and wasted
enough big-play opportunities to allow a marginal Notre Dame team
to break a four-game losing streak and take some heat, at least
temporarily, off the shoulders of embattled coach Bob Davie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt from the first series we could move the ball on those
guys,'' offensive guard Chris Valletta said. ``But when it came
down to it, we didn't get the ball in the end zone and they did.
They got it done and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a typical A&AMP;M effort in a high-profile road
game. Just don't expect the Aggies to circle the wagons _ yet.
After all, this wasn't as bad as last year's black-eye losses at
Nebraska (37-0) or at Oklahoma (51-6).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first game, and everyone's got to lose some time,''
said cornerback Jay Brooks, who gave up both Notre Dame touchdown
passes. ``That's part of the game. It was a \Rnonconference\S game
and it won't hurt us much.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Gamble: ``I'm not going to hang my head. I don't think
anybody else is, either. We've got all the time in the world to get
better before we hit our conference schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   If they improve enough to become conference contenders, the
Aggies will be absolved of this loss by late October. If not, it
will haunt them well into next season. \Ntagtop:Jimmy Burch, (817)

BIG-PLAY MISTAKES STIFLE TEXAS A&AMP;M IN LOSS TO NOTRE DAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ The pass descended from Indiana's summer sky
as though it would be the strike to shake Notre Dame's thunder.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the tight spiral seared Chris Taylor's hands as if a
bolt of lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made that play a thousand times in practice, but I didn't
today,'' the Texas A&AMP;M receiver said softly. ``It was just a lack
of concentration, and that's totally my fault. In my mind, if
you've got a defensive back beat like that, you're supposed to
score. If I had made the play ...''
</P>
<P>
   If.
</P>
<P>
   Too many ifs and too few big plays doomed the 25th-ranked Aggies
during Saturday's 24-10 loss to the Fighting Irish at Notre Dame
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling them that it was one of those games where people
sitting at home were probably saying, `Man, two or three plays and
they might win that game,' '' Aggies quarterback Mark Farris said,
``but that's the way it goes in close games all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The unranked Irish delivered the goods in a season-opening game
between two programs searching to restore lost luster. Notre Dame
quarterback Arnaz Battle played mistake-free football, despite it
being his first collegiate start, and flanker Javin Hunter
delivered the crucial catch that Taylor let slip through his
fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's leaping, third-quarter reception above A&AMP;M cornerback
Jay Brooks in the end zone provided the Irish their first lead of
the afternoon _ one that would not be surrendered. Battle rolled
right on the sprint-out pass and heaved the ball toward the end
zone. Hunter's savvy and athletic ability prevented Brooks from
defending the play and the end result was a 46-yard touchdown that
gave the Irish a 14-10 lead with 3:24 remaining in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was running with him, I thought I was pushing him,''
said Brooks, who surrendered the touchdown in his attempt to avoid
being hit with an interference penalty. ``So, I let up a little
bit. When I let up, I looked back. And when I looked back, he
nudged me a little bit. That's all part of the game. I was looking
for the ball, and he got in front of me and caught it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only minutes earlier, Taylor slipped behind Irish cornerback
Clifford Jefferson. The Aggies expected tight, man-to-man coverage
on their wide receivers on the third-and-six play from their 8, and
Taylor ran a fade in front of the Notre Dame sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Mark did a good job of delivering the ball right
there,'' Aggies coach R.C. Slocum said of Farris, who completed 16
of 28 passes with one interception for 165 yards. ``That was a key
third-down play, and we had to punt the football. As they come up
in games, two or three of those plays like that make a big, big
difference in ballgames. Instead of having the ball with a first
down ... Who knows what would have happened after that if we don't
have to give up the football.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies also aided the Irish with two blown coverages that
led to Notre Dame's game-tying, second-quarter touchdown. The
Aggies failed to adjust properly when the Irish sent fullback Tom
Lopienski in motion. Battle discovered Lopienski all alone in the
flat twice with no linebacker in sight, and those two completions
gained 34 of the 70 yards during the seven-play drive.
</P>
<P>
   Flanker Joey Getherall tied the game by beating Brooks to the
corner of the end zone for a 9-yard touchdown reception from
Battle, who completed 10 of 16 passes for 133 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let my team down on those two plays,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Misery loves company, though, and Brooks and Taylor were not
alone. Tight end RoDerrick Broughton, Farris, strong safety
Terrence Kiel and inside linebacker Cornelius Anthony also
committed costly blunders.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton's third-quarter penalty on fourth-and-goal from the
Notre Dame 1 forced the Aggies to forgo a shot at the end zone and
settle for Terence Kitchens' 23-yard field goal, which gave Texas
A&AMP;M a 10-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Farris later fumbled a third-quarter snap on a quarterback sneak
on third-and-inches, and that forced one of eight punts by Cody
Scates. Kiel and Anthony also allowed Battle to escape potential
momentum-changing sacks twice by failing to wrap him up in the
backfield.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Aggies entered the final quarter staring at a deficit,
and that altered their game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get in a position where we could run ... and just
keep pounding the ball at them, but we got behind and started
having to throw it at the end a little more than we wanted to,''
Slocum said. ``In a matter of minutes there, the thing turned.''
</P>
<P>
   And only for the worse. nn

NO LOVE LOST: RAY LEWIS IS STILL BALTIMORE'S GUY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
BALTIMORE _ Ray Lewis once purchased 250 tickets to a Washington
Wizards game for Baltimore recreation teams. He has pledged $100 to
the Police Athletic League for every 10 of his tackles. He has
hosted bowling tournaments to aid underprivileged children.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's the Ray Lewis whom Baltimore knows.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has been voted to three consecutive Pro Bowls. He has led
the NFL in tackles for two years in a row. He generally is regarded
as the best middle linebacker in football.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Ray Lewis whom Baltimore loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravens fans have no second thoughts,'' said Vito Stellino, a
sports writer for the ``Baltimore Sun.'' ``He's their guy, and as
far as they're concerned, he's a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Six hours after the St. Louis Rams had defeated the Tennessee
Titans, 23-16, in Super Bowl XXXIV, a fight erupted outside an
upscale club in Atlanta's Buckhead entertainment district, some
seven miles from the Georgia Dome. Two men were left dead, and Ray
Anthony Lewis, then 24, was one of three men charged with their
murders.
</P>
<P>
   Even before murder charges against Lewis were dropped in June,
Baltimore rallied to his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that this city has embraced him,'' Ravens
coach Brian Billick said. ``They have since the incident began,
because they know the Ray Lewis we know.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all saw Ray's confidence in his innocence. The serenity
that he carried himself through the whole process, knowing he was
innocent, I think rubbed off on his teammates and transcended to
the people of Baltimore.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is the second-most popular athlete in town behind Orioles
third baseman Cal Ripken. Among his teammates, Lewis sells the most
replica jerseys, and he gets the most cheers.
</P>
<P>
   When he was introduced with the defensive unit for the first
time this exhibition season, he received a standing ovation. It
wasn't an act of forgiveness, but a show of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was there, and I figured he knew what happened, but
I just didn't think he was capable of murder,'' said Brian Brack, a
36-year-old Ravens' season-ticket holder who wears Lewis' No. 52
jersey to games. ``I feel like he could have come out sooner than
he did, but in the end, he did the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravens fans always have believed in Lewis, the No. 26 choice in
the 1996 draft.
</P>
<P>
   They called Lewis' arrest a rush to judgment, and when his
murder trial began, they blamed an overzealous prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult for them to fathom this man, whom they had
seen give so much of himself, as a murderer,'' said Tony White, the
press secretary for Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley. ``I don't
think it was ever really truly believed here. The Baltimore
community never really accepted that.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lewis left the Cobalt Lounge in the early morning hours of
Jan. 31, a confrontation took place on the street. Punches were
thrown, and a champagne bottle was broken over someone's head.
</P>
<P>
   Jacinth Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24, died of stab wounds
as Lewis and his entourage drove away in his $3,000-a-day rented
stretch Lincoln Navigator limousine.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis was sent to jail for the murders, Baltimore held
prayer vigils, ranted on talk radio and snapped up his replica
jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy enough, but yes, after he was arrested, we saw an
increase in sales for his jersey,'' said Geri Durham, owner of The
Sport Shop near PSINet Stadium. ``I don't know whether it was a
show of solidarity, of support for him or if people thought they'd
be collectors' items if things didn't go well for him. I'd like to
think it was more of a show of support than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 5, Lewis pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of obstruction
of justice for giving incomplete statements to police and ordering
those in his limousine to keep quiet. He was sentenced to one year
of probation and required to pay court costs in return for his
testimony against co-defendants Reginald Oakley and Joseph
Sweeting, whom police called ``longtime associates'' of Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors acquitted Oakley and Sweeting of murder, felony murder
and aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he has paid a heavy price for a crime he didn't
commit. He spent more than $1 million in legal fees, and last month
the NFL fined him $250,000, the largest fine in league history for
a nonsuspended player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about what happened in the off-season,'' said
Lewis, who signed a $26 million contract in 1998 and is scheduled
to make $4.75 million this year after restructuring his deal during
training camp. `` ... That wasn't a good part of my life. I don't
really look back on it, but I know it was there. Football is my
life. That's what I think about.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing Lewis never lost was Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ravens scrimmaged the Washington Redskins at Redskins
Park early in training camp, Lewis acknowledged he heard fans'
taunts of ``We know you did it.'' In Baltimore, they are as
convinced Lewis was guilty only of bad judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he really did anything wrong,'' Ravens fan Greg
Dickey, 31, said. ``He hung around the wrong crowd. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore, all is right with the world again. Back in the
heart of the Ravens' defense, Lewis' only trials now are on the
football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any question about his innocence,'' Ravens fan
Darryl Broll, 36, said. ``He was in the wrong place at the wrong
time. Now that his innocence has been proclaimed, he needs to be
left alone. Let him go back to playing football.'' nn

RAMS PROVE LOST CAN BE FOUND

<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to another NFL season of rampant confusion. Teams
coming. Teams going. The problem is, nobody knows anymore which is
which.
</P>
<P>
   It's like when your wife demands that you stop and ask
directions. You, of course, refuse. The manly thing to do is keep
driving. But an hour later, you've ended up in downtown St. Louis,
right in the middle of the Super Bowl victory parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Louis.'' Hey, that parade was supposed to be in
Jacksonville, or Minnesota, or East Rutherford with the Jets. The
Rams were not even a small dot on last September's projected Super
Bowl map.
</P>
<P>
   There you have it _ today's NFL kickoff provides hope for one
and all, even those teams who at the moment are considered
residents of uncharted territory when it comes to making a major
impact. And basically, that list includes every club except the
Redskins, Tampa Bay, the Rams again, plus the Colts and Titans.
</P>
<P>
   The local focus will be on Texas Stadium, where the outcome of
this afternoon's Heat Stroke Bowl won't necessarily come down to Xs
and Os. This one could be decided by IVs. The football stuff,
however, does provide an interesting contrast.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have regrouped for 2000 in a continuing attempt to
relocate some past glory. The main ingredients are all Dynasty Days
retro, including the new head coach, the new/old offense and future
Hall of Fame quarterback and running back.
</P>
<P>
   All this runs opposite to how the memory process works around
here. Nobody cares about once-was. It's our God-given right for
those Super Bowl things to happen ``every'' year. And it's Troy
Aikman's fault if it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, along comes Philly. Now there's a worthless bunch,
those Iggles. About the last time any of us got excited over
anything involving the Eagles was when Buddy Ryan swallowed the
pork chop bone. Otherwise, it's been a one-team bitter rivalry
(they cared, we didn't). Football-wise, the Eagles were going
nowhere. Or better yet, staying nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's a bright young head coach in Andy Reid, who is
surrounding himself with a collection of talent that potentially
will lead the Eagles to future success. Start with the second-year
quarterback, Donovan McNabb. He's everything Aikman isn't, meaning
young and mobile. He's everything the NFL now wants in its
quarterbacks, meaning mobile.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago this was Aikman, including the mobile part. But he
was the ``everything'' quarterback because he stood strong in the
pocket, and had the big arm. By the way, in-the-pocket meant just
that, too. Most quarterbacks who liked to scoot around ended up in
Canada, or today, it would be in Arena League ball.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has become a relic, so say the scouts and local critics.
Way too stationary back there. Even when Kurt Warner, with a
quarterbacking style from the Aikman era, hurled the Rams to a
world championship, the emphasis on today's NFL quarterback didn't
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain degree, it started with college defenses becoming
much more sophisticated,'' Cowboys director of player personnel
Larry Lacewell said. ``If you can't buy time in the college game
these days, you're in trouble. So colleges are going that way at
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   And also one other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the NFL we're getting a wave of black quarterbacks from the
colleges,'' Lacewell said. ``It was happening in the '80s a little
bit. But the door swung open in the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   McNabb came in that door in the much-heralded quarterback draft
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid has stamped himself as the best of that '99 bunch,''
Lacewell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys still count on there being a place for the
Aikman-style quarterback. Obviously there is _ Warner demonstrated
that. And the best quarterback in the NFL right now is Peyton
Manning, who says he patterned his game after Aikman's.
</P>
<P>
   But McNabb brings that ``now'' element. And he brings new hope
to the Eagles. Based on all accounts from Philly, he's smart and
he's a good kid. Don't think that last part isn't important.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, of course, must smile, reading up on how McNabb has
taken Philadelphia by storm. There's his own TV show, and his own
radio show, where he actually takes calls. The endorsement
opportunities pour in. Aikman has had all that, but these days he
backs away from most everything outside of football except his
charity foundation.
</P>
<P>
   When Aikman was a part of Super Bowl winners, the league was
tougher, much tougher. With the right supporting cast, McNabb will
get his Super Bowl shot, and it could materialize in a hurry in a
watered-down league. In today's NFL, teams are coming and going.
Quarterbacks are coming and going. There is no right or wrong
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this afternoon, even the Cowboys and the Eagles have
hope for the 2000 season. Yeah, sure they do. As the Rams proved, a
winner in this league can come from off the map. nn

 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The slingshot serve from the hulking Mark
Philippoussis crashed into the top of the net, ricocheting into the
air on a flight as unpredictable as paper airplane's. But with
whipsaw reflexes, and a little luck, a wide-eyed Jan-Michael
Gambill managed to leapfrog the wayward serve as it headed toward
his body on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster averted. The ball bounced, and the Aussie's double
fault on break point set up Gambill to serve out the final
second-round match of the U.S. Open. But first, there was the
changeover, and time to ponder the moment while a rowdy crowd
chanted for the American at Louis Armstrong Stadium Saturday. And
yet, as Gambill sat in his chair, he had the detached stare of a
subway passenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw my face, I hope that I betrayed no emotion,''
Gambill said. ``Logically, for me to go out there and be too
emotional isn't how I win.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how he won. He stayed as cool as Frigidaire in the
suffocating heat that coated the grounds on Day 6 of the Open. And
only after he calmly finished off a puzzled Philippoussis, 6-4,
6-4, 6-4, did he allow himself to punch his fist into the air.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, Gambill was more than one of the beautiful
people, more than the telegenic player with the Ford Modeling
contract, more than the tanned pinup from Spokane, Wash. Beneath
the surface, he revealed the serious substance of his game.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, the Anna-obsessed were still
searching for that revelation. Instead, they found heartbreak, but
also discovered the budding talent of Justine Henin as she zipped
26 winners by the unsteady and 12th-seeded Anna Kournikova, 6-4,
7-6 (5).
</P>
<P>
   ``She likes her look, everybody likes her look,'' said Henin, an
18-year-old Belgian ranked 58th on the tour. ``But I am not here to
do cinema. I am here to play tennis, and I think that's the best
important.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a suspicion that Kournikova's priorities are
disorganized, at best. While the photo shoots and appearances
related to her multimillion-dollar endorsement deals have made her
wealthy, the distractions appear to disrupt the attention to her
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any outside interests,'' a typically testy
Kournikova said. ``I just have to go back out there and work on my
consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kournikova was featured inside Arthur Ashe Stadium,
second-seeded Lindsay Davenport was taking care of Tamarine
Tanasugarn, 6-2, 6-1, in Louis Armstrong Stadium. Also moving to
the Round of 16, fifth-seeded Serena Williams won in straight sets,
and fourth-seeded Mary Pierce regrouped after trailing by 4-1 in
the second set to get by a mentally punch-drunk Lisa Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks removed from losing her arbitration bid to
be named to the U.S. Olympic team, a drained Raymond managed to
unearth a performance that almost unnerved Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did a really good job of putting everything behind
me,'' said Raymond, who is ranked 26th in singles. ``If you can't
get up for a Grand Slam, you can't get up for anything. I realized
it was a Grand Slam, and I said, `Let's go.'''
</P>
<P>
   She just didn't have enough oomph to get by Pierce. It was
difficult for players to dig deep in such heat. Still, there was
energy, particularly emanating from the cozy confines of Court 10.
At match point, there was a roar heard around the grounds when the
qualifier Hyung-Taik Lee stunned Rainer Schuettler, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4,
6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The victory for Lee, who is only the third Korean to play in a
Grand Slam tournament since the open era began in 1968, left tennis
officials scrambling for a translator. As Lee drew closer to
victory, there was even a call sent out to the United Nations to
find someone to relate Lee's remarkable story. Finally, someone
emerged from the Korean press.
</P>
<P>
   The quaint story could end soon. Lee plays Pete Sampras in the
Round of 16. But what lies ahead for Sampras? In his half of the
draw, top-seeded Andre Agassi was upset on Thursday, then
fifth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov was shockingly dismissed in
straight sets by Dominik Hrbaty. If Sampras can navigate through
potential upsets, he could face another American.
</P>
<P>
   The unseeded Gambill? It is possible. In his half of the draw,
second-seeded Gustavo Kuerten is gone, and there is no clear-cut
favorite. Gambill put his name in that hat by combating
Philippoussis' power on the hardcourt with his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the quick court favors me just as much,'' said
Gambill, who served 17 aces to the 16 for Philippoussis. ``I hit my
ground strokes just as much as he does. He's hitting his serve
maybe 5, 7 or 10 miles faster than me some of the time, but most of
the time, I'm hitting as many aces as he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambill has begun to live up to the billing as the Next Great
American. It has taken some time, but the 23-year-old is making
progress up the ranking. He ended 1999 ranked 58th but has risen to
No. 27. And this rise is why he made what he called one of the most
difficult decisions of his life when he declined a spot on the
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing so many events,'' said Gambill, who has also
picked up some injuries along the way. ``I need time off after the
Open because I have a full schedule of seven events in the fall. I
really want to make a push for the top 10; that's my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The object of his career is to make a statement with his tennis,
not with his camera-friendly good looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never let anything outside of tennis be a
distraction,'' Gambill said recently. ``My focus is on tennis, 100
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Gambill proved it, while Kournikova still has some
work to do.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

criticism from publishing houses.)

YANKEES BEAT TWINS; STEINBRENNER SPEAKS HIS MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Steinbrenner did not even go to Yankee Stadium
on Saturday for Old-Timers' Day, but the owner's words still
hovered over the Yankees in a weird yet hardly shocking manner.
Steinbrenner squawks when things bother him, which was what he did
Friday and Saturday, and which was why the Boss became the focus
over baseball, past and present.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's Daily News, Steinbrenner expressed doubt about
Chuck Knoblauch's puzzling elbow injury by saying the Yankees'
medical staff cannot discover what is awry. He said Jeff Nelson
should ``give us what we want and zip the lip'' and he criticized
Mike Stanton's poor pitching, but said that at least Stanton
admitted when he was struggling.
</P>
<P>
   The comments caused players and Manager Joe Torre to respond to
the charges and made two relief pitchers and a second baseman more
sought after by reporters than Don Mattingly or Yogi Berra.
Steinbrenner embellished his words during a telephone interview
from Ocala, Fla., Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old-Timers' Day is great, but, if we don't get in the
playoffs, no one's going to care about Old-Timers' Day,''
Steinbrenner said. ``Anything I'm telling these guys, I'm telling
them to try to help the team. It's coming from the owner, so they
should listen.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before the Yankees beat the Minnesota Twins, 13-4,
in a rain-shortened seven-inning game, an outraged Knoblauch
defended himself against what he perceived as accusations that he
was not hurt as seriously as he was claiming and he was not playing
because of his throwing problems. Knoblauch used several expletives
in discussing how ludicrous it would be for him not to want to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of being questioned every day like I've got to prove
myself,'' Knoblauch said. ``What do I got to hide from? Everybody
in the world knows I got a throwing problem. So what am I afraid
of? That means I'm not hurt?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't want to play, I'd be home. I've done every test,
cortisone, whatever. What else am I supposed to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner revealed that Knoblauch twice rebuffed the Yankees
when they asked him to get a cortisone shot in his elbow, but he
had a shot to treat his tendinitis last Tuesday. Knoblauch said
``write whatever you want'' as a reporter tried asking him about
refusing to get a shot. Knoblauch, whose medical results were
reviewed by team doctors in New York and Tampa, Fla., and by Dr.
James Andrews of Birmingham, Ala., was surprised when the Yankees
activated him on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's baffled why he's in New York?'' Steinbrenner asked. ``I'm
baffled. I like this kid, but I can't understand him. Do I know
whether he's hurt? No. I can only go by what our doctors say. They
mark him as able. Jeter is black-and-blue. O'Neill has a hip
problem. Canseco is hobbling. Every player is hurt and they're
fighting like warriors. I hope Knoblauch gets back with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was in uniform and did not play for the second
straight game as the Yankees pummeled Eric Milton and four other
pitchers to win their third in a row and move to 20 games over
.500. Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada and Paul O'Neill, the first three
hitters in the lineup, were 7 for 11 with eight runs scored and
five runs batted in. O'Neill, Posada and Scott Brosius homered, and
Denny Neagle pitched five and a third innings to earn the victory.
</P>
<P>
   After he initially said he did not care if Steinbrenner was
trying to infer that he did not have pain, Knoblauch wondered why
he wasn't asked about it while he was rehabilitating in Tampa,
Fla., last month.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner said: ``I never expressed anything to him because I
never felt he wasn't hurt. I was confounded. I was confounded
because he couldn't throw the ball to first base.''
</P>
<P>
   After Torre said Steinbrenner's comments bothered him only if
they bothered Nelson and Stanton, he defended Knoblauch against the
notion that he was afraid to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate,'' Torre said. ``I don't feel that way. If
people do feel that way, I'm sorry that they do. It's unfair if
someone is hurt. I'm trying to figure out why he would want to be
hurt if he isn't hurt. It doesn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was about 20 feet from Torre's office when he spoke,
his voice rising, and he said everyone should view his elbow injury
the way Torre had.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have a throwing problem, no one would be
questioning why I was hurt. No one,'' Knoblauch said. ``I've got 10
years in the big leagues without being hurt. I go on the D.L. once
and I get questioned about being hurt?''
</P>
<P>
   But Steinbrenner continued to link Knoblauch's tendinitis and
his throwing difficulties, saying: ``This thing came about because
he wasn't able to throw to first base with confidence. When he
couldn't hit the first baseman, all of a sudden, comes this
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson learned about Steinbrenner's comments when a neighbor
alerted him Saturday. Steinbrenner criticized Nelson for pitching
wildly and for having a shouting match with Torre on Aug. 20, even
though the bullpen has been a staple in helping the Yankees win
three of the last four World Series titles. Nelson ominously said,
``I got 29 days and the playoffs to put up with this.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nelson was asked if he was planning to leave New York as a
free agent after the season, he dodged the question. But Nelson was
rebuffed when he asked Steinbrenner for a four-year, $16 million
contract during spring training and one of his friends said the
reliever wanted to sign with the Seattle Mariners. ``Whatever
George says doesn't affect me,'' said Nelson, who has blown four
saves in four tries. ``I'm not going to go on the mound and start
thinking about what George said. I don't pitch for him. I pitch for
the team and myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, who said the Yankees would not go far if Nelson
and Stanton did not ``put up or shut up,'' added: ``Do I want
Nelson back? I hope he comes back. If he wants to know about
frustration, he should have half the frustrations I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton has allowed homers in his last four games after
permitting one in his first 55 games and and said Steinbrenner
would be accurate for saying he had not ``done the job.'' Stanton
was asked about Steinbrenner's curious timing for his comments and
said, ``I think it's more the timing of when I'm stinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughed, something that did not happen around
Knoblauch. Knoblauch was perturbed when he had a sore left forearm
in June and speculation about his not wanting to play because of
throwing problems first arose. And now, on Old-Timers' Day,
Steinbrenner made the present feel more like the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this helps get Knoblauch out there on the field, let him
vent on me,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I'm all for helping the team.''

RESIDENTS FEEL ABANDONED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
 &HT;    By BETH BARRETT  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Living atop an oil well has imperiled the health
of Mario Flores' family and the six tenants of his small apartment
building, not made them rich.
</P>
<P>
   Beset by high levels of poisonous and explosive gases leaking
from the well, long ago abandoned, the nine residents of the
Rockwood Street apartment downtown _ just a few hundred yards from
the Belmont Learning Center _ have fallen through the cracks of the
city, county and state regulatory system.
</P>
<P>
   Gas company inspectors found levels of methane gas so high that
they worried an explosion could occur if they went much higher. So
they turned off the pilot light in the water heater.
</P>
<P>
   State inspectors got readings of toxic hydrogen sulfide 100
times the safe level _ the highest their meter would go _ so they
recommended keeping the basement door open for ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   Other state and county officials responsible for health and
safety said they didn't have jurisdiction, pointing to the Fire
Department, whose officials said city code makes no mention of what
to do in such situations although much of Los Angeles is built on
oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want some answers,'' said Flores. ``We've had
environmental people out here, the Fire Department. A lot of them
come out to look at it. Then they go back to their places and never
do anything. There have been no concrete answers from anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores and his wife scraped together the down payment for the
three-unit building two years ago to provide a better life for
their daughter, now 12. They said they were assured there were no
problems, but the rotten-egg stench of hydrogen sulfide and their
inability to afford up to $60,000 for repairs have left them
desperate and afraid for their health.
</P>
<P>
   They have good reason to worry, according to health experts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kaye Kilburn, professor of medicine at the University of
Southern California and an expert on gas poisoning, was asked about
the health threat based on recent tests by the state Division of
Oil and Gas that got readings for hydrogen sulfide of 10 parts per
million when below .1 part per million is considered safe for
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow! that's extremely toxic,'' Kilburn said. ``They're cooking
in hydrogen sulfide; their brains are cooking in it. It's tragic
and it's callous.''
</P>
<P>
   Former state and county environmental regulator Angelo Bellomo,
who played a key role in exposing similar dangers that led to
abandoning Belmont after $175 million had been spent, said the
system of regulatory protections is seriously flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we've learned anything in the last couple of years, it's
that we need to increase our vigilance when it comes to
developments on top of shallow oil fields,'' said Bellomo, interim
director of the Los Angeles Unified School District's Environmental
Health and Safety Branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not theoretical, but actual measurements that suggest
a source of methane and hydrogen sulfide, which could endanger the
residents of the dwelling. For regulatory agencies not to step in
aggressively and to evaluate the extent of this risk is
unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenant Caesaria Cerda has been complaining to state, county and
local regulators since moving into her apartment in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not indifferent, we care, but he's in a bad position
with that oil well down there that no one is taking responsibility
for,'' said fire inspector Luke A. Milick.
</P>
<P>
   He said abandoned oil wells aren't dealt with in the city's
building and safety codes. The best option might be to abandon the
building, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in real life, you can't do that. Maybe in some cities, the
health department would say, `You can't live here.' But that's not
a very humane way of dealing with the problem,'' Milick said. ``And
I don't have the law behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   The tenants in the downstairs apartment where the odor is
strongest are Johana Sanchez and her husband, a mechanic. She is
pregnant and is worried about birth defects, but the $350-a-month
rent is all they can afford.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanchezes have moved their bed to a corner where the
rotten-egg smell is less noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, we got headaches,'' she said. ``Now we don't
notice.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, Southern California Gas Co. inspectors turned off
the pilot light on the basement water heaters to prevent an
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   California Division of Oil and Gas technicians then went to the
house and got readings for hydrogen sulfide as high as their
instruments would record.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the level exactly was, we don't know,'' said Richard
Baker, district deputy for the Division of Oil and Gas.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors gave the same advice they've provided since their
first visit to the triplex Feb. 17, 1993: Open the basement door
and hire a private consultant to find and fix the leak.
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   Even when the basement was fully ventilated, however, the
hydrogen sulfide was measured at 1 part per million.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said he got a quote from a geologist of $15,000 to study
the oil well, and $45,000 to properly cap it. With minimum-wage
jobs, the Floreses have no money for the repairs, having already
taken out a second mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, Cerda has waged her own unsuccessful battle
with two owners and numerous regulators. Retired, she says she
can't duplicate the rent elsewhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gas investigators who first came to the property in 1993
told Cerda to be careful and get professional advice on mitigating
the oil well.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, the state official, said portions of the building would
have to be torn down enough to expose the leak before the state
could assist in repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Phil McAlmond, president of McAlmond Oil Co. Inc. that operates
10 oil wells near the Floreses and owns the mineral rights under
the apartment, said the well is typical of those closed up years
ago without proper sealant. He said gas seepage is a well-known
problem, which the school district should have known about when it
purchased the Belmont property.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 1,250 oil wells in this field in the early 1900s,''
McAlmond said. ``To pretend there was no gas seepage when there's
gas seepage all over was to ignore reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerda said she finally went to the Los Angeles County Department
of Health Services in 1966 and got inspectors to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out and scared the heck out of me,'' she said.
``They said, `Don't close the windows.' But then after a while,
they finally said there was nothing wrong. I asked them for a
letter saying it was safe. I never got a letter. When I asked, they
said they couldn't send such a letter.''
</P>
<P>
   County records show investigators visited the triplex April 2,
1996, and traced the smell of ``rotten eggs'' to the basement but
their equipment was inadequate to get a reliable measure.
</P>
<P>
   The county file shows Cerda was told to contact a certified
geologist, and in the meantime to install an exhaust fan in the
basement to force the contaminated air outside.
</P>
<P>
   The fan never was installed, but at some point a pipe was shoved
from the basement through an outside wall. Inspectors said the vent
does not appear to meet city codes.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Banuelos, the neighbor closest to the pipe, says he has
to keep all his windows closed to keep the smell of hydrogen
sulfide out of his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reported it 15 to 20 years ago to the Fire Department, and
they put in a pipe, but it doesn't help,'' said Banuelos, a retiree
who suffers from prostate cancer. ``Every place around here is a
problem. You can smell the contamination.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mario Flores, a former Mexico City street singer who has
struggled to make a better life in Los Angeles, the crack in the
regulatory system offers no way out of his dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my American dream. We worked so hard to get it,'' he
said. ``I'm at the point where I'm afraid I'll just have to live
with the situation _ or die with it.''

ACRE BY ACRE, A FAMILY FARM IS DISAPPEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH CALDWELL, N.J. _ Standing in the middle of James
Matarazzo's eggplant patch and gazing up toward his grandfather's
farmhouse, which dates to the 1840s, it's almost possible to
imagine what life was like here before the split level and the
strip mall turned New Jersey into the paradigm of American-style
sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   But without a good set of blinders, there's no missing the newly
built McMansions that surround Matarazzo Farms, nearly 80 of them,
all plunked down on land the family has sold over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Matarazzo grins as he gestures toward one subdivision, Oyster
Pond, where million-dollar homes have been set around a former
livestock watering hole. ``People put docks on it,'' he says with a
bittersweet laugh. Of course, with land selling at $300,000 for
half an acre these days, the laugh is more sweet than bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Of the original 103 acres that Matarazzo's grandfather, who
emigrated from Italy, cleared in 1921, only 23 are still growing
produce.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in northern Essex County, one of the most densely
settled places in the nation's most thickly populated state, it's a
wonder that Matarazzo Farms exists at all. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture counted 21 farms in the county in 1997, but Matarazzo
says all but 2 have since given way to development. Statewide,
despite an ambitious farm preservation program, more than 50,000
acres of farmland have been lost in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we have a sluggish season, we sell off a few more
acres,'' Matarazzo explains. ``The land prices make it too
tempting.'' The most recent parcel he sold, where cauliflower,
broccoli and corn once grew, is awaiting the construction of seven
homes.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he's holding on to the rest. His 88-year-old father,
Joe, still rides the tractor; his wife and sister run the produce
stand; and at 54, Matarazzo figures he has a few more seasons left
in him. ``I'll probably die doing this,'' he says, lighting his
pipe, a Panama hat shading his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   His three children work in air-conditioned offices and hate to
rise with the sun, so Matarazzo has no illusions about the farm's
long-term future. Every month or so, a land-craving developer stops
by and makes an offer. Matarazzo usually tells them to come back
another day. ``Every time I think of selling, I get a knot in my
stomach,'' he says, sorting through a bin of tomatoes, some of them
spotty from the overabundance of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the odd complaint about rotting produce or noisy
irrigation equipment, most residents prize the farm for its fresh
produce, bucolic vistas and autumnal hayrides, which draw
neighborhood children. Maria Rampinelli, a local real estate
broker, said she liked the idea of using more land for more houses,
but would hate to see all of it go. ``You know, there's absolutely
nothing for sale here,'' she said of the housing market. ``But then
again, I'd really miss their bread-and-butter corn.''
</P>
<P>
   When he's not thinking about selling, Matarazzo has more mundane
worries: fiendish weather, sagging crop prices, and voracious deer.
As the amount of open space here shrinks, the remaining deer are
becoming hungrier, peskier, and less fearful. Folk remedies like
human hair, bars of soap, and a pack of barking dogs have all
failed to keep them out. His latest foil, an eight-foot-tall fence
costing $5,000, has been a bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen them hop right over with little effort,'' he says,
pointing out rows of ravaged cucumbers, corn, and arugula leaves.
``We lose more stuff to the deer than we sell.''
</P>
<P>
   With his slightly frayed chinos, well-trimmed beard, and
philosophical musings, Matarazzo doesn't look the part of the
tobacco-chewing, weatherworn yeoman. Like his father before him, he
is the mayor of North Caldwell, a part-time job he has held for 14
years. ``I guess I keep getting re-elected because everyone always
knows where to find me if they have a problem,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Matarazzo never planned to be a farmer. The long hours and the
summer vacations he spent hunched over in the sun as a teenager
convinced him that he was meant for another vocation. The summer
after he graduated from Villanova University with plans to become a
sociologist, Matarazzo returned home to make some pocket money.
</P>
<P>
   He never left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to get away from this,'' he says, yanking a
small cucumber from the vine and popping it into his mouth. ``I
guess I could never get used to the idea of working indoors day in,
day out.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are downsides to the agricultural life. He
rarely takes a day off, and on the few occasions that he and his
wife, Pat, have ventured to Cancun or Boca Raton for a week, he
found himself distracted by the Weather Channel. ``I never really
relax when I'm not here,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, on a Wednesday afternoon, he drives the
17 miles to New York City. After buying cigars, he stops at the
Pierre Hotel on Fifth Avenue for a martini and a game of
matchsticks _ a tradition he's maintained for 35 years. ``It's a
stupid old-men's game, but I love it anyway,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Besides exhausting days and endless weather worries, there is
another downside to farming: dirty fingernails. But Matarazzo has
found a home-grown remedy: laundry bleach. ``If I'm rushing out for
a town meeting or to New York and I don't have time to scrub, I'll
dip my fingers in a cup of Clorox,'' he explains. ``Does the trick
every time.''

RESIDENTS FEEL ABANDONED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 &HT;    By BETH BARRETT  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Living atop an oil well has imperiled the health
of Mario Flores' family and the six tenants of his small apartment
building, not made them rich.
</P>
<P>
   Beset by high levels of poisonous and explosive gases leaking
from the well, long ago abandoned, the nine residents of the
Rockwood Street apartment downtown _ just a few hundred yards from
the Belmont Learning Center _ have fallen through the cracks of the
city, county and state regulatory system.
</P>
<P>
   Gas company inspectors found levels of methane gas so high that
they worried an explosion could occur if they went much higher. So
they turned off the pilot light in the water heater.
</P>
<P>
   State inspectors got readings of toxic hydrogen sulfide 100
times the safe level _ the highest their meter would go _ so they
recommended keeping the basement door open for ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   Other state and county officials responsible for health and
safety said they didn't have jurisdiction, pointing to the Fire
Department, whose officials said city code makes no mention of what
to do in such situations although much of Los Angeles is built on
oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want some answers,'' said Flores. ``We've had
environmental people out here, the Fire Department. A lot of them
come out to look at it. Then they go back to their places and never
do anything. There have been no concrete answers from anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores and his wife scraped together the down payment for the
three-unit building two years ago to provide a better life for
their daughter, now 12. They said they were assured there were no
problems, but the rotten-egg stench of hydrogen sulfide and their
inability to afford up to $60,000 for repairs have left them
desperate and afraid for their health.
</P>
<P>
   They have good reason to worry, according to health experts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kaye Kilburn, professor of medicine at the University of
Southern California and an expert on gas poisoning, was asked about
the health threat based on recent tests by the state Division of
Oil and Gas that got readings for hydrogen sulfide of 10 parts per
million when below .1 part per million is considered safe for
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow! that's extremely toxic,'' Kilburn said. ``They're cooking
in hydrogen sulfide; their brains are cooking in it. It's tragic
and it's callous.''
</P>
<P>
   Former state and county environmental regulator Angelo Bellomo,
who played a key role in exposing similar dangers that led to
abandoning Belmont after $175 million had been spent, said the
system of regulatory protections is seriously flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we've learned anything in the last couple of years, it's
that we need to increase our vigilance when it comes to
developments on top of shallow oil fields,'' said Bellomo, interim
director of the Los Angeles Unified School District's Environmental
Health and Safety Branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not theoretical, but actual measurements that suggest
a source of methane and hydrogen sulfide, which could endanger the
residents of the dwelling. For regulatory agencies not to step in
aggressively and to evaluate the extent of this risk is
unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenant Caesaria Cerda has been complaining to state, county and
local regulators since moving into her apartment in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not indifferent, we care, but he's in a bad position
with that oil well down there that no one is taking responsibility
for,'' said fire inspector Luke A. Milick.
</P>
<P>
   He said abandoned oil wells aren't dealt with in the city's
building and safety codes. The best option might be to abandon the
building, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in real life, you can't do that. Maybe in some cities, the
health department would say, `You can't live here.' But that's not
a very humane way of dealing with the problem,'' Milick said. ``And
I don't have the law behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   The tenants in the downstairs apartment where the odor is
strongest are Johana Sanchez and her husband, a mechanic. She is
pregnant and is worried about birth defects, but the $350-a-month
rent is all they can afford.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanchezes have moved their bed to a corner where the
rotten-egg smell is less noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, we got headaches,'' she said. ``Now we don't
notice.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, Southern California Gas Co. inspectors turned off
the pilot light on the basement water heaters to prevent an
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   California Division of Oil and Gas technicians then went to the
house and got readings for hydrogen sulfide as high as their
instruments would record.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the level exactly was, we don't know,'' said Richard
Baker, district deputy for the Division of Oil and Gas.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors gave the same advice they've provided since their
first visit to the triplex Feb. 17, 1993: Open the basement door
and hire a private consultant to find and fix the leak.
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   Even when the basement was fully ventilated, however, the
hydrogen sulfide was measured at 1 part per million.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said he got a quote from a geologist of $15,000 to study
the oil well, and $45,000 to properly cap it. With minimum-wage
jobs, the Floreses have no money for the repairs, having already
taken out a second mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, Cerda has waged her own unsuccessful battle
with two owners and numerous regulators. Retired, she says she
can't duplicate the rent elsewhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gas investigators who first came to the property in 1993
told Cerda to be careful and get professional advice on mitigating
the oil well.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, the state official, said portions of the building would
have to be torn down enough to expose the leak before the state
could assist in repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Phil McAlmond, president of McAlmond Oil Co. Inc. that operates
10 oil wells near the Floreses and owns the mineral rights under
the apartment, said the well is typical of those closed up years
ago without proper sealant. He said gas seepage is a well-known
problem, which the school district should have known about when it
purchased the Belmont property.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 1,250 oil wells in this field in the early 1900s,''
McAlmond said. ``To pretend there was no gas seepage when there's
gas seepage all over was to ignore reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerda said she finally went to the Los Angeles County Department
of Health Services in 1966 and got inspectors to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out and scared the heck out of me,'' she said.
``They said, `Don't close the windows.' But then after a while,
they finally said there was nothing wrong. I asked them for a
letter saying it was safe. I never got a letter. When I asked, they
said they couldn't send such a letter.''
</P>
<P>
   County records show investigators visited the triplex April 2,
1996, and traced the smell of ``rotten eggs'' to the basement but
their equipment was inadequate to get a reliable measure.
</P>
<P>
   The county file shows Cerda was told to contact a certified
geologist, and in the meantime to install an exhaust fan in the
basement to force the contaminated air outside.
</P>
<P>
   The fan never was installed, but at some point a pipe was shoved
from the basement through an outside wall. Inspectors said the vent
does not appear to meet city codes.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Banuelos, the neighbor closest to the pipe, says he has
to keep all his windows closed to keep the smell of hydrogen
sulfide out of his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reported it 15 to 20 years ago to the Fire Department, and
they put in a pipe, but it doesn't help,'' said Banuelos, a retiree
who suffers from prostate cancer. ``Every place around here is a
problem. You can smell the contamination.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mario Flores, a former Mexico City street singer who has
struggled to make a better life in Los Angeles, the crack in the
regulatory system offers no way out of his dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my American dream. We worked so hard to get it,'' he
said. ``I'm at the point where I'm afraid I'll just have to live
with the situation _ or die with it.''

McCANN PROVES HE CAN 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ So you were expecting what, that he was going
to be sulking over on the bench and not ready? That after he threw
the worst pass of his brief career, he was going to shrivel up?
</P>
<P>
   Seems there is still plenty to learn about quarterback Ryan
McCann, not that Alabama wants to know any more.
</P>
<P>
   McCann is the former Agoura High quarterback who hoped to win
UCLA's starting job this summer, only to learn two weeks ago Cory
Paus had won out.
</P>
<P>
   Being as how they are both redshirt sophomores, this did not
bode well for McCann's UCLA future.
</P>
<P>
   Then something happened to his immediate playing prospects. On
the Bruins' first play from scrimmage Saturday, in their first game
of the year, Paus separated his throwing shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, McCann was the man.
</P>
<P>
   No problem.
</P>
<P>
   He went up to offensive linemen along the sidelines and told
them ``not to worry, we're going to do this.'' Instead of feeling
the pressure, he was rallying the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to let everybody know I wasn't all shook up and
nervous,''McCann said. ``I'd been in this position before last year
with the Washington game. I just wanted to let `em know it was
going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a little better than that. McCann directed the Bruins to
three consecutive touchdown drives. UCLA's confidence grew by the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Then when Alabama intercepted him and returned it for a 91-yard
touchdown, he quickly came back with his first career touchdown
pass, a 46-yarder to Freddy Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   This time UCLA had a lead it would never surrender, rolling to a
35-24 upset over third-ranked Alabama. And UCLA had an understudy
making like a star.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, his life was made dramatically easier by the rushing
of DeShaun Foster (211 yards on 42 carries), but McCann cooly
completed 14 of 24 passes for 194 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And with Paus' injury expected to keep him out for two to four
weeks, the Bruins are in need of a quarterback who can keep his
cool.
</P>
<P>
   All this from someone who could have reacted with borderline
depression to the news he was looking at three years of backing up
Paus. Or he could've taken a quick trip out of town.
</P>
<P>
   When fellow prospect J.P. Losman learned last year he would not
open the season as the starter quarterback, he immediately
transferred to Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan has never moped,'' said UCLA offensive coordinator Al
Borges. ``He has never sulked. He has never complained about being
a second quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He prepares just like our starting quarterback. You get a guy
who's a disgruntled guy, who's going to whine about not playing,
feel sorry for himself - that is not a guy who can take on that
role. But he never did that, and that's why he performed like he
performed. He knew what he was doing when he went in there.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann said he had no interest in making like Losman when UCLA
coach Bob Toledo and Borges told him Paus would start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to deal with it,'' McCann said. ``They said, you
have to be patient. You just have to keep your head up. I knew
opportunities happen like this. You just have to be ready when your
time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann had already experienced the UCLA quarterback roller coast
last year, when he started the year No.4 on the depth charts and
took over for Paus when he got injured against Washington and then
started the USC game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his stats from last year (33 of 63, 388 yards, 3 INTs, 0
TDs) were hardly indicative of Saturday's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan McCann came in and just did an outstanding job of
directing our football team,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He studies the game hard, he works hard, and he'll continue to
get better. I'm proud of him, because a lot of guys when they're
not first, they run for it. He didn't run. He stayed with our
program and he got his chance.''

RUTGERS GETS OFF TO A GOOD START 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ After one game, Rutgers has equaled its
victory total for last season. True, this 34-21 triumph was over
Villanova, a Division I-AA opponent that usually plays teams a
level below the I-A Scarlet Knights. But the result was satisfying
nonetheless for Rutgers Coach Terry Shea, who is trying to save his
job, and for his starting quarterback, Mike McMahon, who returned
from a serious shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon, not yet at his best, threw five touchdown passes, tying
a school record, among his 27 completions in 44 attempts for 323
yards. Shea's team, which was 1-10 last season, survived several
special-teams mistakes before 23,752 in Rutgers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the football game,'' Shea said. ``We have 100 miles to
travel, and we're going to travel them.'' Regarding his
quarterback, Shea said: ``He certainly makes things exciting when
he moves around the field. He's got a tremendous arm.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon, who played just five games in 1999, often worked from
the shotgun, for both running and passing plays. And he showed a
better touch on his shorter throws. He frequently threw while
rolling out and seemed to play with poise despite his long layoff.
He sustained a bloody nose and was temporarily stunned after making
a tackle following an interception in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers led by 14-7 at halftime and it might have been by more
but for a botched punt that helped set up a Villanova score. On
fourth-and-18 on the Rutgers 48, snapper Brian Hohmann sent the
ball over punter Mike Barr. The play died on the Rutgers 10 and
Villanova scored on the next play, a completion from Brett Gordon
to Brian Westbrook to make the score 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the only strange play involving special teams. When
a Rutgers field-goal attempt was blocked, Dennis Thomas of the
Scarlet Knights kicked the ball ahead, picked it up and carried it
to near the Villanova goal line. But the Wildcats were awarded the
ball at their 16 because the play had officially died there. Later
in the second quarter, a Rutgers punt hit the helmeted head of
Villanova's Braheem Powell and went out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon's first touchdown pass went for 17 yards to Errol
Johnson to bring a successful end to Rutgers' first possession. The
second touchdown pass, with 2 minutes 43 seconds left in the second
quarter, went for 3 yards to L.J. Smith to make the score 14-7.
</P>
<P>
   On the first drive of the second half, a Villanova fumble gave
Rutgers the ball at the Wildcats 33. Seven plays later, the Knights
increased their lead to 20-7 when McMahon and Johnson connected in
the end zone again, for 5 yards.

   PASADENA, Calif. _ The afternoon was as delightfully clear, cool
and breezy as you might ever find in the Arroyo Seco in September.
Hello, San Gabriel Mountains, didn't expect to see you looking so
grand.
</P>
<P>
   And the game? Well, that was not in the long-range forecast,
either.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA didn't just defeat Alabama on Saturday in the football
season's local opener. The unranked Bruins pushed around the No. 3
team in the country and won 35-24. It wasn't necessarily that
close. It was a day to savor all around.
</P>
<P>
   As the stadium clock wound down to :00, the Bruins celebrated as
if they'd just won the Rose Bowl - or, more to the point this
season, the Orange Bowl, the national-championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Players sprinted to midfield, hugged and danced as if they'd
been saving it up for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Poli-Dixon had a jolly good laugh at the expense of the
dazed Alabama players, taunting them with a droll ``Roll Tide,
roll!''
</P>
<P>
   Freddie Mitchell bounced up and down in front of the cheering
UCLA fans beside the locker-room tunnel, waving the people to their
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The fans sent the Alabamans home with a sing-song chant of
``Over-rated!''
</P>
<P>
   At his locker minutes later, Mitchell sought to correct those
exuberant fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not overrated,'' the receiver who caught one pivotal
touchdown pass and threw another said of the Crimson Tide.
``They're a great team ... But we might be No. 1!''
</P>
<P>
   At which point you were tempted to say everybody was getting a
bit carried away here.
</P>
<P>
   You wanted to command the Bruins to calm down, at the risk of
raining on their parade.
</P>
<P>
   After all, wasn't it possible this victory, like the weather,
was a freak of nature, a one-time thing? Wasn't this merely the
first game of a long season? Wasn't Alabama undone as much by its
own overconfidence as by UCLA? Wasn't that substantially the same
bunch of players in blue and gold that went 4-7 last year?
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't the Bruins' party mood be tempered by worry about the
state of their quarterbacking after Cory Paus' first-possession
shoulder injury put the ball in the shakier hands of Ryan McCann
for as long as a month?
</P>
<P>
   Where was a coach when they needed one, to tell them to simmer
down and start focusing on the next hurdle - you know, Fresno
State?
</P>
<P>
   ``Reel `em in a little bit?'' offensive coordinator Alan Borges
said with a smile. ``I think we're going to have to (do that) in a
couple of days. But let them enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only get so many chances to win games like this, and to
celebrate wins like this.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right.
</P>
<P>
   This, more than most victories, and more than any last season,
was one the Bruins should be allowed to celebrate as vigorously as
they did.
</P>
<P>
   They suffered through 1999, first at their own hands, because of
their handicapped-parking transgressions, then from injuries and
inexperience. Then they spent an offseason hearing how bad they
were going to be in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   After that, who could blame them for expressing their
satisfaction following their first victory over a top-three
opponent in a decade?
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to show the country that the Bruins are back,''
tailback DeShaun Foster said after gaining 187 yards on 42 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we're back,'' head coach Bob Toledo said,
``but I'm very, very excited right now for our football team and
the Pac-10. ... This has to go down as one of (my) all-time great
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it ensure that there will be more great wins for UCLA in
the weeks ahead? Not at all. This might end up being the high point
of the Bruins' football season. An unaccountably pretty day when
everything went right.
</P>
<P>
   If so, all the more reason to enjoy it while they can.
</P>

   &UR; A STAR CALLED HENRY: Volume 1 of `The Last Roundup' &LR;  By Roddy
Doyle. (Penguin, $14.) The first novel in a planned trilogy
recounts the coming of age of Henry Smart, born into wretched
poverty in the Dublin slums at the turn of the century and caught
up as a teen-ager in the 1916 Easter Rebellion. Before long he is
enlisted by Michael Collins to recruit a rebel army by day and
assassinate the movement's enemies by night. This ``witty, furious
and bitingly detailed story,'' chosen by the editors of The New
York Time Book Review as one of the best books of 1999, plays
subversive tricks with history as it punctures Ireland's national
legend, Richard Eder wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A RAGE TO LIVE: a Biography of Richard and Isabel Burton &LR;  By
Mary S. Lovell. (Norton, $19.95.) The author uses persuasive new
material in her partisan account of an eminent Victorian couple who
offended just about everyone with their many exploits (real and
imagined). Last year the reviewer James R. Kincaid called this ``an
extraordinary biography.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FENCING MASTER &LR;  By Arturo Perez-Reverte. (Harvest/Harcourt,
$13.) This novel, set in Madrid in 1868, revolves around one of
Spain's last remaining fencing masters, who becomes reluctantly
involved in political intrigue after an exotic woman hires him as
an instructor. ```The Fencing Master' is a splendid performance,''
Walter Satterthwait wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INCIDENTS IN THE LIFE OF A SLAVE GIRL: Written by Herself &LR;  By
Harriet A. Jacobs. Edited by L. Maria Child. New edition edited by
Jean Fagan Yellin. (Harvard University, $16.95.) This 1861 slave
narrative, long thought to be either a novel or a ghostwritten
autobiography, but authenticated in 1981 by Yellin, charts the
harrowing sexual exploitation of its narrator. The result is ``one
of the major works of Afro-American literature,'' Henry Louis Gates
Jr. said in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FASTER: The Acceleration of Just About Everything &LR;  By James
Gleick. (Vintage, $14.) From day-trading mania to a Japanese
restaurant that charges by the minute, this fact-filled book
surveys today's hyperdriven society, as well as the pitfalls of
ever-greater speed and connectedness. The result is a ``nimble,
smart, often funny and _ best of all _ fast'' road trip on ``the
autobahn of modern life,'' Barbara Ehrenreich said in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COME BACK, LOLLY RAY &LR;  By Beverly Lowry (Louisiana State
University, $15.95.) The heroine of this 1976 novel is Lolly Ray
Lasswell, a virtuoso high school majorette from a Mississippi
trailer park who enchants _ and later outrages _ the residents of
her small hometown. ``The flashes of Flannery O'Connor-like
toughness are gratifying to the core,'' Joe David Bellamy wrote.
``Lowry's imagination proves sound and patient.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY DATE WITH SATAN: Stories &LR;  By Stacey Richter. (Scribner,
$11.) These tales, populated by rock stars, metalheads and the
Prince of Darkness himself, are bound together by an awareness of
the common humanity underlying our chosen personas, however
eccentric they may be. ``Sometimes very funny, sometimes too
bizarre for their own good,'' the stories display ``a refreshingly
original vision, reminding us at every turn that our surfaces
rarely reflect the depths of our human reality,'' Elizabeth Gleick
wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CATFISH AND MANDALA: A Two-Wheeled Voyage Through the Landscape
and Memory of Vietnam &LR;  By Andrew X. Pham. (Picador USA, $14.) The
author, who fled Vietnam with his parents as a child, describes his
yearlong 4,000-mile bicycle trip up the Pacific Coast of the United
States and on through Japan and finally Vietnam, where he embarks
on a painful parallel journey into his family's past. ``At its
finest moments, his narrative becomes a meditation on the state of
loneliness that is everyone's lot in the modern world,'' Adam
Goodheart wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; SOUTH WIND CHANGING &LR; , by Jade Ngoc Quang Huynh (Graywolf,
$16), a Vietnamese refugee tells of his ordeal in a forced-labor
camp during the war, his harrowing escape and his struggle to
create a new life in America. His account ``achieves an unlikely,
powerful blending of lyricism with straightforward descriptions of
cruelty,'' George Packer said in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY SHE LEFT US &LR;  By Rahna Reiko Rizzuto. (Harper Perennial,
$13.) This novel, featuring four different narrators, follows three
generations of a Japanese-American family whose members were
interned during World War II. Last year the reviewer Sarah Saffian
praised the ``simple, lyrical beauty of the language.''
