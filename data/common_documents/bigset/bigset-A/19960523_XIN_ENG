<HEADLINE> Japan Develops TV Sets Capable of Accessing Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Japanese home electrical appliance
makers are scrambling to develop television technologies that
allow users to access the Internet on their TV screens, Kyodo News
Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
Although users can watch television programs on their personal
computers (PCs), home applicance makers feel it is high time to
develop "Internet television sets," Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Such sets could make their debut by the end of this year, the
news service quoted Japanese industry sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The makers are trying to develop remote control units that
enable users to access Internet home pages easily on TV screens,
so that would-be personal computer buyers will not be scared away
by complicated operating procedures, they said.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Electric Corp. is seeking to develop what it calls
"intelligent television" sets equipped with PC capabilities, Kyodo
said.
</P>
<P>
The company is considering marketing a range of products of
various grades, from a high-end television capable of playing
CD-ROMs to a low-end model which only allows users to retrieve
Internet home pages.
</P>
<P>
Victor Co. of Japan said it is trying to meet the technical
challenge of allowing users to easily access gateways to the
Internet by means of telephone networks.
</P>
<P>
Officials at Toshiba Corp., Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. said
they are also developing Internet television technologies, Kyodo
added.

prepared by the Attorney-General's office on how to deal with any
irregularity, the police chief added.
</P>
<P>
A full closure will be imposed on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
three days before the election day to prevent possible terrorist
attacks against Israeli targets.
</P>

Hefez also said that so far, 120 cases of confrontations and
incidents involving activists from various political parties have
been registered.

PHNOM PENH, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Cambodian People's
Party (CPP) President Chea Sim has reportedly decided to travel to
Beijing on Friday to meet King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk, who suffers from cancer, arrived in Beijing for
medical treatment on May 18.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim, acting head of state, proposed the meeting with King
Sihanouk, according to a report in the local newspaper "The

<P>
An adviser to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and Ly Thuch, chief
of cabinet for First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh, confirmed
the king's agreement on the meeting Tuesday night.

<P>
"He will inquire about the king's health and report on the

Another source close to Chea Sim speculated that the CPP leader
would ask the king to move up his return to Cambodia to prevent

<HEADLINE> Rotary Grants WHO 16 Mln Dlrs for Polio Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Rotary International today granted
the World Health Organization (WHO) 15.8 million U.S. dollars in
support of global eradication of poliomyelitis.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the many grants of the kind the organization has
made since WHO announced in 1988 the target to eradicate polio
globally by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
By the time polio is eradicated, the financial contribution of
the charity of more than a million members organized in 28,000
clubs around the world will total some 400 million dollars,
including about 240 million dollars raised in 1988 alone.
</P>
<P>
"The contribution of Rotary is more than money," said WHO
Director General Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, who meanwhile praised the
commitment individual Rotarians to polio eradication, "which has
made this initiative into a unique collaboration between the
public and private sectors."
</P>
<P>
When presenting the grant, Robert Barth, trustee of the Rotary
Foundation, said, "This grant means that we share... a commitment
to a common goal and to the coalition forged to achieve that
goal."
</P>
<P>
The Rotary grant today includes 9 million dollars aiding
operational support for the 1996 immunization against polio of
over 5 million children under five in 26 sub-Saharan African
countries.
</P>
<P>
The remaining sum will fund the services of polio medical
officers in WHO branches in the Western Pacific, Southeast Asia,
Europe, and Africa from July 1996 through to the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, at least 100 million dollars in external
support will be needed annually to achieve polio elimination by
the year 2000 and after the goal is reached, the world will save
1.5 billion each year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, the overall number of polio cases reported has
declined by 83 percent around the world.
</P>
<P>
The grant was presented to WHO at a ceremony marking the 200th
anniversary of the world's first successful immunization --
vaccination by British physician Edward Jenner on May 14, 1796
against smallpox.

<P>
HANOI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A rare red wolf, listed in the
world's endangered species red book, has been found in Vietnam's
central province of Quang Tri, Vietnam News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
A typical adult of the wolf, formally known as Cuon Alpinus
(Pallas), has fire-like red brown hair and weighs 16-35 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Red wolves appeared in midland areas of the province last year
and killed nearly 150 cattles. Due to lack of information on this
precious species, local people killed many of them.
</P>
<P>
The wolves are also reported to live in the northern mountain
province of Lao Cai and the central highland provinces of Gia Lai
and Kon Tum.
</P>
<P>
The existence of this rare wolf has been confirmed by a group
of Vietnamese and foreign experts from the National Center on

<HEADLINE> Major Calls for Timetable on Lifting Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
called on the European Union today to set out a timetable on
lifting its worldwide ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the prime minister's office revealed that Major
had set up a group to determine the strategy Britain would pursue
to get the EU' ban lifted.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman warned that a partial lifting of the ban by
June 4 was not enough to stop Britain's non-cooperation policy.
</P>
<P>
Amid the beef ban row with the EU, the prime minister lost his
patience Tuesday and threatened to disrupt normal EU business
unless rapid progress was made on this matter.
</P>
<P>
He told the House of Commons that Britain would not be able to
agree on any matter of unanimity of the EU if the European
Commission remained opposed to any relaxation of the
eight-week-ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the prime minister has softened his position
today when he reassured EC President Jacques Santer that Britain's
campaign was not intended to target Brussels bureaucracy,
according to a BBC TV report.
</P>
<P>
Now a task force of senior government ministers has been
meeting at Downing Street to work out the government's strategy on
how to solve the EU's beef ban.
</P>
<P>
At the same time Britain has launched a diplomatic offensive to
explain to its EU partners about Britain's position.

<HEADLINE> World's Fastest Superparallel Computer Developed in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Japanese scientists have developed
what they claim to be the world's fastest superparallel computer,
capable of making 300 billion calculations per second, the Yomiuri
Shimbun reported today.
</P>
<P>
The computer, which uses 1,024 microcomputers, is about 10
times faster than the best supercomputer currently in use and will
help scientists in their quest to understand the birth of
universe, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The computer was jointly developed by more than 30 experts from
Tsukuba University, Tokyo University, Electro-Communications
University and others at a cost of 1.6 billion yen (16 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Supercomputers process data in a conveyor system, whereas
superparallel computers use microcomputers to simultaneously
process data, sharply reducing calculation time, said officials
from the Computation and Physical Science Center in Tsukuba
University.
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope to use the superparallel computer to simulate
conditions right after the birth of universe, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Such an experiment cannot be done with a supercomputer because
of the time required to make the calculations, and only an
approximation of the conditions has been available so far.
</P>
<P>
The newly developed superparallel computer will make it
possible to fully simulate the birth of universe, said Yoichi
Iwasaki, head of the research center.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki's Economic Blueprint Not Rejected: ANC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The African National Congress
(ANC) had not rejected Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's growth and
development strategy, the party said today in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The ANC was reacting to a newspaper report claiming that the
strategy would not become the government's policy document at
this stage, because it had been rejected by the ANC's highest
policy-making body, the National Executive Committee (NEC).
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued from its head office in Johannesburg,
the ANC said: "There is no truth in this claim."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the NEC meeting in Cape Town had not taken
any particular decisions on the growth and development strategy
itself.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki unveiled the strategy in February stipulating an annual
economic growth of six percent with employment to be increased to
500,000 by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that Mbeki's economic blueprint had
resulted in a battle between the "moderates and leftists" within
the ANC.

<HEADLINE> Salt Has Little Effect on Blood Pressure: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Canadian researchers are challenging
conventional wisdom that reducing salt in the diet will be good to
people's health and help prevent hypertension.
</P>
<P>
Salt has little effect on the blood pressure of people under
45, and restricting salt in the diet might create other health
problems, according to a new study by Canadian researchers, which
was published Tuesday by the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
A re-analysis of 56 earlier diet experiments shows that only
older people with high blood pressure would benefit from salt
reduction in their diet, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The study, headed by Dr. Alexander Logan of Toronto's Mount
Sinai Hospital, also argued that avoiding salt can be harmful in
some cases, especially among people who do a lot of exercises.
</P>
<P>
"For healthy people, we can no longer accept on blind faith
that restricting salt intake is harmless," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salt can only be a secondary cause of high blood pressure.
Other factors, including weight, alcohol consumption and lack of
exercise, can have more effect on blood pressure than diet, he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, the Canadian study has been disputed by experts
elsewhere, who insist that the study was paid for and represented
an effort of the salt industry to discredit earlier findings that
low salt in diet helps prevent hypertension.

</P>
<P>
Wu Xueqian, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said
economic factors are playing a more and more important role in
international relations.
</P>
<P>
Wu was speaking at the 14th annual conference of the

<HEADLINE> UK Business Leaders Dismiss Euroscepticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Bryan Nicholson, who retires today
as president of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI),
launched a fierce attack on Conservative Eurosceptics.
</P>
<P>
The CBI president condemned those advocating that Britain
should withdraw from the European Union as "a plague of locusts."
</P>
<P>
At the CBI's annual dinner Tuesday night, Nicholson said he was
appalled by the standard of debate on Europe in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
Some members of parliament conducted themselves with a
discourtesy that "can onely serve to embarrass and alienate those
of us, a large and increasing number, who do business with our
European partners," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the UK's membership of the EU was not
incompatible with operating in global markets.
</P>
<P>
As a trading nation, he said, the UK was dependent on access to
emerging markets such as the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
And access to these markets was more easily secured through
membership of the EU, the world's biggest trading bloc, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the EU had "far more influence" than Britain
alone could have.
</P>
<P>
According to the CBI's news release issued today. Nicholson
particularly condemned Sir James Goldsmith, chief of the
Referendum party, for his bid to secure a referendum on Britain's
future in the EU.
</P>
<P>
He said that serious politicians differed completely from such
"reckless pseudo-patriotic voices."
</P>
<P>
Sir Colin Marshall, who was elected today new president of the
CBI, said that at such a challenging time for business, "our task
must be to secure a climate which supports and increases the
competitiveness of British industry."
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the CBI, as a leading employers' organization
in Britain, would shortly be publishing its business agenda aimed
at influencing the political parties' menifestoes in the run-up to
the general election scheduled for one year later.

ISLAMABAD, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Deep-rooted and time-tested

</P>
<P>
These were remarks made today by Raja Saroop Khan, Governor of

eight-member delegation of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) headed by its

<HEADLINE> Canada Studies Law to Counter Anti-Cuban Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is
considering a tit-for-tat legislation to protect the interests of
Canadians who could face expensive lawsuits in the United States
under a new anti-Cuban bill.
</P>
<P>
Canadians hit with U.S. court orders to pay damages to Cuban
exiles would gain the ability to sue in turn those same exiles in
Canadian courts, today's Globe and Mail newspaper quoted official
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to one proposal under study, Canadians could then get
a court order of their own awarding them the costs of their legal
bills in both countries, plus a sum equal to the damages awarded
by the U.S. court, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. anti-Cuban legislation, called Helms-Burton bill,
purports to extend the jurisdiction of U.S. courts to Canadian and
other foreign businessmen with investments in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The bill was adopted after Cuba downed two light aircraft piloted
by the U.S.-based Cuban exiles.
</P>
<P>
It allows Cuban exiles who have become U.S. citizens to sue for
compensation from foreign business people who "traffic" in
property expropriated by the Cuban government. The executives and
their families could also be barred entry to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy voiced his hope that
diplomacy will head off a legal confrontation before the U.S. law
goes into effect on August 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Once diplomacy fails, the Canadian government is considering
options such as retaliatory legislation, the paper quoted the
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bill Graham, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the
House of Commons, has already drafted his version of the required
retaliatory legislation and sent it to the Canadian foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian legislation "would signal to the United States
that there could be an expensive downside to Washington's attempt
to make Canadians comply with the embargo," Graham noted.
</P>
<P>
The tit-for-tat legislation would require some "simple
amendments" to the an existing Canadian law, the Foreign
Extraterritorial Measures Act, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian act, adopted in 1984, was originally aimed at
preventing Canadian subsidiaries of the U.S.-based companies from
complying with an earlier version of the Cuban trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
Subsidiaries and their Canadian executives caught cancelling
contracts with Cuba are subject to prosecution under the act.
</P>
<P>
Canada has invested heavily in mining and vacation-resort
properties in the Caribbean island countryts interests would be
badly damaged once the U.S. anti-Cuban bill were to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The country has been fighting against the U.S. bill before and
after it was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by President
Bill Clinton over two months ago.
</P>
<P>
It has also enlisted the strong support from Mexico, Japan and
the European Union as well as Central American and Caribbean
countries.
</P>
<P>
Many other countries are also trying to make their case,
arguing that the Helms-Burton bill severely damages international
trade principles.

<P>
LUANDA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Angola's unified national army will
have been formed by June or July this year.
</P>
<P>
This was reached between the government delegation led by
chief of the army's general staff Joao De Matos and the UNITA
delegation headed by its deputy chief of the general staff Lutoki
Wiyo during talks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They told newsmen at the end of the talks that the mixed
commission on the peace process today will decide on the date in
which the UNITA troops will join the unified army, and on the
concrete form of how they will be integrated.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of military leaders from both sides was arranged
in accordance with the talks between the heads of both sides in
Libreville, Gabon on March 1.
</P>
<P>
At the talks Tuesday, the two sides also discussed what posts
the generals of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) will assume in the unified army in the future.
</P>
<P>
The formation of a unified national army constitutes the key
in Angola's peace process. Whether the peace process succeeds or
not hinges on the smooth formation of this army.
</P>
<P>
If this goes on smoothly, the next key issue will be the
formation of a government of national unity, people here say.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The world-known Tretyakov Art
Gallery, located in central Moscow, today held a ceremony marking
its 140th birthday.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin pledged at the ceremony to let Russian
culture "be the key concern of the state policy," signing a decree
for allocating more money and buildings to the gallery.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that the Russian culture is going through a
hard period and vowed to "preserve and replenish our rich culture
heritage."
</P>

The reform in the first years of transformations in Russia had
"put culture in a dramatic position," Yeltsin said.

"Now that we have survived, the spiritual sphere should be the
key concern of the state policy," he added.

<P>
One hundred and forty years ago, a rich Russian, Pavel
Tretyakov, bought a historic painting called "Battle against
Finnish Contrabandists" which formally started the road to the
Tretyakov art collection.

The gallery now exhibits 100,000 Russian classic and modern art
works, receives thousands of visitors all over the world every

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Economic slowdown has led to
the sharp weakening of the South African currency in recent
weeks, a prominent economist of the country said in a statement
here today.
</P>
<P>
Terence Moll of the country's leading insurance company, Old
Mutual, said high economic growth expectations by foreign
investors over the past two years, which led to an "amazingly
stable" Rand for a certain period, appeared to have been too
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
He said the capital inflows might be on the decline due to the
looming economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The Rand has depreciated by almost 20 percent from 3.65
against the U.S. Dollar in mid-February to 4.33 against the
Dollar early this month.
</P>
<P>
Moll predicted that the Rand will not depreciate further but
would not return to its previous levels for the foreseeable
future.

JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- South African Police
Commissioner George Fivaz said in a statement in Cape Town today
that a plan is needed to step up protection of diplomatic corps
and business interests in the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement followed two recent attacks by robbers on the
Libanese diplomats in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The police commissioner said escalating crime against foreign
diplomats in South Africa will have "a negative effect on foreign
investment and tourism".
</P>
<P>
An urgent and intensive consultation process between the
police and other sectors will be initiated in order to seek
common ground on how to address the issue, according to the
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
On May 19, Lebanon's interim ambassador to South Africa,
Charbel Stephan, was handcuffed and roughed up by thugs at his
residence in Johannesburg. The criminals stole about 10,000 Rands
(about 2500 U.S. Dollars) and goods.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in One-Third of EU Regions Above EU Average </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- In the year to April 1996,
unemployment in one-third of the European Union (EU) regions was
still higher than the 10.7 percent average recorded in April 1995,
said a report out today from EUROSTAT.
</P>
<P>
According to the data of EUROSTAT, the Statistical Office of
the European Communities in Luxembourg, the top end of this list
comprises regions of Italy, Finland and Spain, where, for two
consecutive years, more than one quarter of the labor force is
without a job.
</P>
<P>
Foremost in the list is, once again, the Spanish region of
Andalucia with a 33.3 percent of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
As a contrast, Luxembourg, which is not broken into regions,
stands on the other end with a rate of 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that within most EU member countries,
unemployment rates in the hardest-hit regions are two to three
times and more, as high as in the regions with the lowest
percentage of jobless.
</P>
<P>
The level of female unemployment is still higher than the male,
throughout the regions of the EU, with the exception of Finland,
Sweden and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, in some regions of Spain and the south of Italy,
over one-third of the female working population are now without a
job, while the Spanish regions of Ceuta y Melilla, Extremadura and
Andalucia suffer from a female unemployment rate in the vicinity
of 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate among young people under 25 has risen again in
one-quarter of the regions.
</P>
<P>
Rates of over 20.5 percent, which is the EU's average, are
encountered in almost all of the regions of France, Greece, Italy
and Sweden and in all of the regions of Finland and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The situation is most serious in Spain, where in the region of
Ceuta y Melilla, in April 1995, 71.6 percent of young people in
the labor force were not in employment.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kuwaiti MPs Press for Checking Visa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's parliamentary members
have agreed to probe into visa trafficking problem which they said
has become rampant in this small Gulf state which depends mostly on
expatriate laborers in its public as well as private economic
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The MPs called on the government authorities to eradicate
what they described as a "dangerous phenomenon" in the country.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the current Kuwaiti National Assembly (parliament)
set up, for the first time in its term, a three-member
investigation committee to probe the problem of visa traders
through a 25-9 vote on the decision following a heated debate on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
The committee has been given vast powers to investigate the
problem and evaluate measures taken by the Ministry of Social
Affairs and Labour and to report to the Assembly within two
months, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
It is also entrusted with identifying the obstacles that hamper
the detection and a radical and final solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
During a weekly parliamentary session earlier, several
parliamentary members charged that visa trading in the country is
rampant and the government failed to face it because of
influential people behind it.
</P>
<P>
MP Mishari Al-Ossaimi slammed visa traders as "persons trading
with the sweat of humans," adding that a few number of persons
exploited some loopholes in the procedures after the liberation
and traded with labourers.
</P>
<P>
MP Ali Al Baghli said some expatriates yearning to come to
Kuwait to dig gold are sometimes compelled to sell off their
houses and animals at home to obtain a visa for Kuwait, but only
"unknowingly land in hell once they land at the Kuwait
International Airport."
</P>
<P>
Local intermediaries trick these poverty-stricken persons into
coughing up huge sums of money by holding out the promise of a
visa to Kuwait, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the "visa mafia" had submerged the country in surplus
Asian and Arab manpower, adding that the mafia could charge up to
1,500 dinars (nearly 5,000 U.S. dollars) per head in the illegal
laborers trade.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports said that earlier, the visa traders used to
bring in laborers after receiving money and then, after two or
three days, they would report the laborers missing to escape
punishment while the laborers would be deported.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show the total labour force in Kuwait now
exceeds 1 million, including 843,000 non-Kuwaitis and 172,000
Kuwaitis. Now the country has more than 1.6 million residents. But
60 percent of them are foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
The illegal expatriate laborers trade has caused surplus of
labour force, exploitation by the employers of the expatriates,
burden on health care spending and some social problems in the
country, the MPs complained.
</P>
<P>
MP Abdullah Al Naibari said "I believe that the government
authorities are well aware of visa traffickers, but do not take
action against them. The government should clamp down on
influential visa traders and eliminate corruption."
</P>
<P>
He did not indicate whom his criticism was pointed at.
</P>
<P>
The parliament's Health and Labour Committee presented a
report recommending to carry out a comprehensive survey of all
licenses of manpower recruitment in the country in order to find
out which companies or employers have recruited more manpower than
they needed.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the Ministry of Commerce, Interior and
Social Affairs and Labour of the country are responsible for the
booming of this illegal trade because they failed to implement
laws strictly.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Social Affairs and Labour Ahmad Al-Kulaib, while
admitting the problem exists, insisted that its "size is very
small compared to that of the expatriate labour" in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry introduced last year a law according to
which penalties on visa traders could be fines up to 5,000
Kuwaiti Dinars (16,500 U.S. dollars) or a three-year
imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Extradite Palestinian Wanted in Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese authority is to hand
over a Palestinian wanted by Germany for his alleged involvement
in a bloody bombing in Berlin in 1986 to a German military
delegation Thursday, a Lebanese public prosecutor announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
Judge Adnan Adoum said that the German military delegation
would escort Yasser Chreidi to Berlin to stand trial for his
alleged participation in the bombing of the La Belle discotheque
in Berlin on April 15, 1986, in which three persons were killed
and more than 100 were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The public prosecutor added that two Lebanese army officers
would accompany the German delegation to extradite the defendant,
who was born in Ein Al-Hilweh, the largest Palestinian refugee
camp southeast of the southern Lebanese port city of Saida.
</P>
<P>
Chreidi, 36, was sentenced in prison for carrying a forged
passport by a criminal court in Saida two years ago. He is
believed to be linked to Abu Nidhal, one of the terrorists most
wanted by Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany has pressed for long Chreidi's extradition for his
role in the April 15, 1986 bombing, in which two American
servicemen died. The demand was repeatedly rejected by the
Lebanese judicial authority on the grounds that there was no
extradition treaty between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The bombing prompted Ronald Reagan, then-president of the
United States, to order air raids on Libya.
</P>
<P>
Chreidi was employed as a driver at the Libyan diplomatic
mission in East Berlin, capital of the former East Germany,
and returned to live in Lebanon in 1989 after the removal
of the Berlin Wall.

<HEADLINE> WHO Marks Bicentenary of World's 1st Immunization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
today marked the 200th anniversary of the world's first successful
immunization -- vaccination against smallpox in 1796, which was a
milestone event in preventive medicine.
</P>
<P>
"Edward Jenner's use of cowpox against smallpox on 14 May 1796
was probably the single most important breakthrough in the history
of medicine,, said WHO Director General Hiroshi Nakajima at a
commemorating ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He praised the British physician "as one of the greatest
benefactors to mankind and as the father of preventive medicine."
</P>
<P>
Jenner's discovery has led to the eradication of smallpox on
earth in 1977 eventually and the development of many other
vaccines making the prevention of some major killer diseases
possible, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
The instrument also allows the possibility of eliminating or
eradicating some diseases such as poliomyelitis, measles and
neonatal tetanus.
</P>
<P>
WHO has said it is hopeful that in view of the progress so far
made, it will be able to reach the goal set in 1988 of ridding the
earth of polio by the year 2000, making polio the second disease
eradicated following smallpox.
</P>
<P>
WHO also said that about 80 percent of the world's children
were reached by immunizations services by 1990. The WHO
immunization program today targets eight diseases: tuberculosis
(TB), diphtheria, neonatal tetanus, whooping cough, polio,
measles, yellow fever and hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
Of them, TB alone killed about 3.1 million people in 1995.
</P>
<P>
WHO said in the next five years, the challenges the
immunization program faces are to raise immunization coverage to
at least 90 percent and to introduce new and affordable vaccines
without delay.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Confirms Commitment to Peace in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Vikto Chernomyrdin
today reiterated the Russian government's wilingness to settle the
conflict n Chechnya by peaceful methods and confirmed that
President Boris Yeltsin plans to go to the rebel local republic.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with members of the Chechen community in Moscow,
Chernomyrdin said he is "ready to meet any Chechen filed commander
or any influential Chechen who can control the situation in the
republic."
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to guarantee his security, bring him to Moscow
and take him back to Chechnya after talks," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He criticized some political forces' promises to "liquidate the
Chechen conflict within two or three days" if they win
presidential elections in June.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to resolve the Chechen conflict, but how? It
should be remembered that whole peoples were deported in carriages
in a matter of several days," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin stressed that the Russian government's top
priority tasks in Chechnya include the termination of combat
actions and the surrender of arms by separatists and the
residents.
</P>
<P>
"The only issue that will not be discussed is Chechnya's
cessation from Russia. After peace is restored there, we will
focus on elections and the restoration of the republic," the
premier pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He did not specify Yeltsin's plan on Chechen trip.
</P>
<P>
But a high-ranking official of the Russian Defense Ministry
said today that Yeltsin is likely to visit Chechnya only after the
federal troops seize the last rebel stronghold of Bamut in the
southwest of the republic.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting has raged for Bamut, which is a former Soviet
missile base, for several days. As a result, over 20 Russian
servicemen were killed and 48 wounded, the official said, adding
that about 120 Chechen rebels were killed.
</P>
<P>
He said the fighting was going on with the use of artillery,
tanks and aircraft, but the army did not use more "efficient"
weapons to destroy the fortified village in order to save the
lives of Russian POWs kept in Bamut and to spare the military
installations and communications.
</P>
<P>
The federal forces are confronted by "up to 1,000 (Chechen)
rebels there," the official said, without giving the figure of the
federal troops.

ANKARA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana arrived here this evening for a 24-hour visit expected to
concentrate on the disputes between Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Solana told reporters that he was
"optimistic" on solving the problems between the two NATO members.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council calls on all parties to comply with their obligations
under the Basic Agreement on the Region of Eastern Slavonia,
Baranja and Western Sirmium in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Making the disclosure in a presidential statement adopted
today, Council President Qin Huasun of China said that the council
has considered the letter of U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali which contained his assessment of the Transitional
Administrator that the military component of the United Nations
Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and
Western Sirmium (UNTAES) had been deployed.
</P>
<P>
The military component of the UNTAES was ready to undertake its
mission of demilitarizing the region as from May 21.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council stressed that all parties must refrain
from any unilateral action which could hinder the implementation
of the basic agreement including the process of demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
The council called upon the government of Croatia to grant
amnesty to all persons who, either voluntarily or by coercion,
served in the civil administration, military or police forces of
the local Serb authorities in the former United Nations Protected
Areas with the exception of those who committed war crimes as
defined in international law.
</P>
<P>
Noting the law on amnesty recently passed, the council called
upon the government of Croatia to make this amnesty comprehensive
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council underlined the key importance of attention
to the need for economic reconstruction and rehabilitation of the
region and encouraged member states to contribute to this.
</P>
<P>
The UNTAES, which was established by the Security Council in
last January, consists of 100 military observers, 5,000 troops,
600 policemen and 477 international personnel.
</P>
<P>
Its mandate includes monitoring demilitarization, helping
refugees return home, assisting establishment of an interim local
police force, assisting elections and coordinating economic
development in the region in Croatia.

MOSCOW, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the World Bank signed
here today an agreement on the provision of a 350 million U.S.
dollar loan for upgrading Russia's highway overpasses and bridges,
according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by Russian First Deputy Prime Minister

The loan may be fully applied in 1997, he said, adding that the
loan's money will be used to pay for specific completed work and
purchases.
</P>

"would force us to choose a costly missile defense as long-range
missile attacks on the United States is extremely remote".
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry told reporters earlier in
the week that the so-called the rogue nations could not build
long-range missiles against the United States in at least 15
years.
</P>
<P>
It makes little sense to build a system now "before we know the
details and dimension of the threat we face," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has insisted that the United States should
develop and deploy a national missile defense system by 2003. It
has proposed to add billions of U.S. dollars to the Pentagon
budget in the fiscal years of 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year Clinton vetoed the defense legislation that contained
a national missile defense program, expressing concern that it
could violate a 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty with Russia.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Party Wants President to Give up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's former largest
opposition the Awami (People's) League (AL) today reiterated its
call for President Abdur Rahman Biswas to give up his control over
the Defense Ministry for the sake of a "free and fair" atmosphere
for the country's coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
A mutiny attempt by the troops loyal to the deposed Chief of
Army Staff A.S.M. Nasim was thwarted Monday after Nasim was put
under a house arrest by the Defense Ministry under the president.
</P>
<P>
Biswas has kept his control on the defense portfolio since
early April when a caretaker government was set up under the
leadership of Chief Adviser Habibur Rahman following the forced
step-down of the former ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
The AL accused the president of "acting as a representative of
the ex-ruling party BNP, which is conspiring to divide the army to
foil the coming polls" scheduled for June 12.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here this afternoon, AL chief
Sheikh Hasina said the coming general elections might not be "free
and fair" if the president continued to hold the charge of the
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The charge of the Defense Ministry and all executive powers
must be vested in the non-party caretaker government, she
demanded.
</P>
<P>
She said the caretaker government, though assigned to oversee
the elections, could not function independently unless the
president gives up his control over the defense portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the AL would withdraw from the polls if Biswas
rejected its demand, Hasina said "only time will answer that."

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The House of Representatives has
approved to increase the spending of the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) and 11 other mostly Pentagon-based intelligence
agencies in the fiscal year of 1997, Congress sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the House's fiscal 1997 intelligence act passed
Wednesday, the 12 main U.S. intelligence agencies will get more
than 30 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The CIA has said that it will intensify its operations against
growing economic espionage by foreign governments and companies in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Under an amendment that passed 417 to 6 by the House, the
United States would slightly change the current CIA policy
prohibiting use of American journalists as agents or U.S. news
organizations as cover except in cases of extraordinary
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
CIA regulations say that the prohibition could be waived by the
CIA director. Under the amendment, the U.S. president must waive
the ban and certify it is "necessary to address the overriding
national security interest of the United States."

<HEADLINE> WHO Marks Bicentenary of World's 1st Immunization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
today marked the 200th anniversary of the world's first successful
immunization -- vaccination against smallpox in 1796, which was a
milestone event in preventive medicine.
</P>
<P>
"Edward Jenner's use of cowpox against smallpox on 14 May 1796
was probably the single most important breakthrough in the history
of medicine,, said WHO Director General Hiroshi Nakajima at a
commemorating ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He praised the British physician "as one of the greatest
benefactors to mankind and as the father of preventive medicine."
</P>
<P>
Jenner's discovery has led to the eradication of smallpox on
earth in 1977 eventually and the development of many other
vaccines making the prevention of some major killer diseases
possible, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
The instrument also allows the possibility of eliminating or
eradicating some diseases such as poliomyelitis, measles and
neonatal tetanus.
</P>
<P>
WHO has said it is hopeful that in view of the progress so far
made, it will be able to reach the goal set in 1988 of ridding the
earth of polio by the year 2000, making polio the second disease
eradicated following smallpox.
</P>
<P>
WHO also said that about 80 percent of the world's children
were reached by immunizations services by 1990. The WHO
immunization program today targets eight diseases: tuberculosis
(TB), diphtheria, neonatal tetanus, whooping cough, polio,
measles, yellow fever and hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
Of them, TB alone killed about 3.1 million people in 1995.
</P>
<P>
WHO said in the next five years, the challenges the
immunization program faces are to raise immunization coverage to
at least 90 percent and to introduce new and affordable vaccines
without delay.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Calls for Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Nepali official today
urged foreign investors, especially those from Japan, to invest in
Nepal and tap the country's competitive potentials.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on foreign direct investment here today,
Industry Minister Dhundi Raj Shastri said the government has
adopted an open economic policy aiming at transforming Nepal's
agro-based economy through effective industrialization.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, attended by high-ranking government officials,
local industrialists and Japanese investors, was organized by the
Industry Ministry and the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of
Commerce and Industry which are seeking to promote Japan's
investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Shastri, the government has been revamping its
policies on industry, business, labor, revenue and capital flow in
a bid to encourage investment of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government has made the attracting of foreign
investment and technology an important strategy in the country's
industrial development.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Ambassador to Nepal Shigenobu Yoshida said at the
seminar that a group of Japanese investors would invest about 18
million US dollars in Nepal's telecommunications sector within the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Nepal had granted permission to
about 300 foreign investment projects worth nearly 800 million US
dollars by last month.
</P>
<P>
Half of these projects are already in operation, providing jobs
to some 54,000 Nepalese workers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
India is now the top foreign investor in Nepal, followed by
Japan, the United States and China.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Indonesia
defeated South Korea 4-1 and China beat Denmark 5-0 in the
semi-finals to qualify for the final at the 16th Uber Cup world
women's badminton team championships here today.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won Uber Cup in 1994, 20 years after its first
victory. The Indonesian win brought to a stop Chinese triumphant
advance which featured five consecutive wins since their first
appearance in the even in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, who seek for a first ever consecutive win and third
overall victory here, will thus clash with China in the final
Saturday evening. China aim at regaining the sport's most
coverted trophy and a record sixth victory. China has tied with
Japan on the event's history book, each winning five times. The
Americans -- winners of the first three titles during the 50s and
60s -- have long faded away from the sport.
</P>
<P>
Susi Susanti, Indonesia's ace and Olympic champion, brought
about somthing unblievable as she defeated South Korea's Bong Soo
Hyun in just 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean, obviously under great pressure, collected
only seven points in the two games, the third time to be defeated
so badly in the 24 meetings so far between the two, ranked second
and third in the world.
</P>
<P>
Bang lost to Susanti 11-5, 11-2 in the Asian Games final in
1994 and conceeded to the Indonesian 11-1, 11-6 in the final of
last year's Malaysian Open.
</P>
<P>
But, considering Bang's three wins over Susanti during the last
12 months, including that at the All-England Open semi-finals
earlier this year, what happened today really came as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
The defeat of their ace player's greatly dampened South Korea's
determination as the following doubles match went 15-3, 17-16 in
defending champions's favor and Indonesia's new star Mia Audina
scored a hard-won 2-1 win over Kim Ji Hyun, ranked 10th in the
world.
</P>
<P>
But the South Koreans were not someone easily to give up.
After losing the second doubles, 12th-ranked Ra Kyung Min won
their team's only match, by beating Yuliani Santoso 11-4, 11-4 in
the third singles.

<P>
BONN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The world's population grew by 1.6
percent to nearly 5.8 billion last year, despite a slowdown in the
growth rate, a German population research fund has reported.
</P>
<P>
The increase of 87.7 million, was marginally lower than the 88
million increase in 1994, a local newspaper quoted the report as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The global birth rate has fallen 0.1 percentage points from 3.1
percent in 1994 to 3 percent last year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the population of developing countries
has reached 4.5 billion, 80 percent of the total world population.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 95 percent of the world's births were in Asian,
African and Latin American countries and regions, while Europe's
population growth has been at a standstill for years.
</P>
<P>
The report predicts that if the birth rate keeps declining at
last year's speed over the next 29 years, the global population in
2025 will be 8.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 5 Thai Ministers Resign to Avoid Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 23 (Xinhua) -- One minister and four deputy
ministers resigned from the Thai cabinet today to save Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-archa from a dilemma on cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties and some members of the ruling seven-party
coalition have been urging Banharn to dismiss unpopular ministers
with suspected involvement in money scandals.
</P>
<P>
The five cabinet members who resigned today are Minister of
University Affairs Boonchu Trithong, Deputy Interior Minister
Suchart Tancharoen, Deputy Finance Minister Newin Chidchob, Deputy
Industry Minister Anusorn Wongwan and Deputy Commerce Minister
Pairote Suwanchawee.
</P>
<P>
All of them belong to the Therd Thai faction within Banharn's
Chart Thai (Thai Nation) party.
</P>
<P>
During a no-confidence debate from May 8 to 10, Deputy Interior
Minister Suchart and Deputy Finance Minister Newin were among the
10 cabinet members accused by the opposition of implication in
inappropriate land and financial deals.
</P>
<P>
Although the opposition's motion was defeated in the
parliament's voting on May 11, one of the coalition parties -- the
Palang Dharma (Virtue Force) party -- abstained on the vote for
Suchart, who, as a result, received the least support among the
10.
</P>
<P>
The Palang Dharma said the deputy interior minister's defense
against the opposition's charge of land and loan irregularities
was not convincing enough.
</P>
<P>
The Palang Dharma urged the prime minister to reshuffle the
cabinet and dismiss Suchart, or the party might reconsider its
position in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Howeve, the Therd Thai faction claims 25 of the 391
parliamentary seats in the lower house -- a strong force in the
coalition's total of 232 seats, which Banharn cannot afford to
forsake.
</P>
<P>
The en masse resignation today has apparently made it possible
for both the Therd Thai faction and the Palang Dharma to stay in
Banharn's government.
</P>
<P>
Therd Thai sources said the faction would remain in the Chart
Thai party and that the five cabinet members would be replaced by
five people from the same faction.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Premier Stresses Relations with Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres met here today with visiting Turkish navy commander
Adm. Guven Erkaya amid reports of Turkish dissatisfaction with the
bilateral military cooperation agreement.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Peres stressed the importance of warm
relations between Israel and Turkey and praised the military
cooperation agreement signed between the two countries earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish navy commander is currently on an official visit to
Israel at the invitation of Israeli Navy Commander Rear-Adm. Alex
Tal.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz reportedly said earlier
this week that the military agreement with Israel did more harm
than good.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz raised doubts about the accord, which has been
criticized primarily by Syria and Iran. Two Turkish newspapers
cited him as telling his own party that the harm of this accord
has outweighted its advantages.
</P>
<P>
The statement cast a shadow upon relations between Israel and
Turkey. However, the Turkish Foreign Ministry issued a statement
in Ankara Wednesday night denying comments by Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
The party of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz also issued a
statement this morning, declaring that Turkey has no intention to
alter the agreement.
</P>
<P>
In February, Israeli Defense Ministry Director-General David
Ivry and Turkish Deputy Chief of Staff Cevik Bir signed the
bilateral military cooperation agreement which is widely believed
to involve shared military training, exchange of observers,
intelligence and an exchange of visits by aircraft and naval
vessels.
</P>
<P>
Israel will be permitted to use Turkish air space for training
four weeks a year, according to the agreement.

<HEADLINE> OECD Members Urged to Abide by WTO Trade Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Ministers attending the OECD meeting
urged countries to resist all forms of protectionist pressure and
stop all international trade practices that run against World
Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
</P>
<P>
A communique released at the end of the annual ministerial
meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) said all members should abide by the principles
of the WTO and boycott any form of protectionism.
</P>
<P>
It urged all member states to settle their trade disputes
through negotiation and the mechanisms stipulated in the
agreements under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that most member states are showing
prospects of economic recovery, with inflation generally under
control and interest rates dropping considerably.
</P>
<P>
However, large budget deficits, high unemployment rates and
imbalances in distribution remain challenges, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers vowed to strengthen cooperation with non-member
states to realize sustainable development and non-inflationary
economic growth, to create more jobs and to combat poverty.
</P>
<P>
The ministers asked the OECD to map out a new strategy for the
organization's future role and work and to reform its management
and working methods.
</P>
<P>
Before the opening of the two-day meeting, Russia surprised
many by presenting its application to join the 27-nation body. But
most representatives believe Russia shouldn't rush for membership.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland have already applied to
join.
</P>
<P>
Donald Johnston, of Canada, is to succeed France's Jean-Claude
Paye as secretary-general of the organization on June 1.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition Commemorates Late Chinese Bridge Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of China's bridge
construction opened here today to mark the 100th anniversary of an
outstanding Chinese bridge building expert.
</P>
<P>
Mao Yisheng (1896-1989) designed China's first modern bridge, a
steel double-decker bridge over the Qiantang River in east China's
Zhejiang Province, which enables both trains and automobiles to
across the river.
</P>
<P>
Before that, all steel bridges in China were built by
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Mao received his master's and doctor's degrees in the United
States in the 1910s and 1920s. "Mao's Law", stipulated by Mao in
his doctorate thesis titled "Secondary Stresses in Bridge
Trusses", made him a well-known figure among world bridge experts.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s Mao was involved as an adviser in building the
first bridge over the Yangtze River, the longest river in
China. He was also the head of the inspection team for the
construction of the Great Hall of the People during the same
period.

SOFIA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two AIDS sufferers have been

18 patients in the whole of last year, a state official said here

Eighteen of the 22 patients were infected with the virus

AIDS, the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, has killed 38
people and infected 172 in Bulgaria. Three of the dead were

<HEADLINE> City Denies Punishing Brides For Pre-Marriage Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Municipal officials here have
strongly denied reports that the city's hospital examined
unmarried women and penalized those who has lost their virginity.
</P>
<P>
Earlier a western news agency carried a report, based on a
story published in Nanfang Weekend, a Guangzhou-based tabloid,
claiming that Wuhan had taken the measure to examine the hymens of
women applying for a marriage certificate with fines imposed on
women found with a "broken hymen".
</P>
<P>
An official who was quoted in the tabloid story refuted the
report. "The author of the tabloid's story never interviewed me,"
said Zhang Xianwu, director of the marriage division of Wuhan
Civil Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"Wuhan municipal government has never issued any regulation to
punish those who had pre-marital sex," said Li Jieju, director of
the municipal Civil Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"The city's marriage registration office never made a rule to
penalize women found to have had sexual experiences before
marriage or not being a virgin," the bureau chief added.
</P>
<P>
"The city's marriage registration office only penalizes those
people who get married without registering with the government or
those who get married before reaching the legal marriage age," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to China's marriage law, the legal marriage age for
men is 22, and women 20.
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely absurd to punish women who were found not to
be a virgin," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The medical examination of unmarried couples before issuing
marriage certificate aims to discover if either of the couple have
any diseases harmful to marital life," he said,"this requirement
shows the government's concern about the married couple."
</P>
<P>
Over recent years, the city's marriage registration office has
issued certificates to 50,000 couples annually, including over 200
spouses from the United States, Germany and France, as well as
from Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
As Wuhan has a population of seven million, "the marriage
registration work is so heavy that it is inevitable to see a few
cases of misconduct by a few individual staff workers," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
"But the wrongdoings of a few individuals cannot be blamed as
the conduct of the local government," the local government
official said.

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Price Indices Rise in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Consumer Price Index
A (CPI A) rose by 6.9 percent in April compared with an increase
of 6.7 percent in March this year, according to the Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Price Index B (CPI B) also rose marginally, from
7.3 percent in March to 7.4 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the increase of Hang Seng CPI was 7.7
percent in April, slower than the corresponding increase of 8.2
percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Composite CPI, which is compiled based on the combined
expenditure pattern of all households, showed an increase of 7.3
percent in April 1996, same as in both February and March.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said here today that the slightly faster
 increase in CPI A in April than in March was mainly due to higher
 prices of some food items, including vegetables and live poultry.
</P>
<P>
The prices of durable goods, transport fares, and charges for
miscellaneous consumer services rose more moderately, the
spokesman said, adding that the prices of miscellaneous goods
continued to record a year-on-year decline.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first four months together, the increase in CPI A
and CPI B averaged at 6.5 percent and 7.2 percent respectively
over a year earlier. The corresponding increase for Hang Seng CPI
and Composite CPI were 8 and 7.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
For the 12 months ended April 1996, CPI A and CPI B were
higher by 7.7 and 8.3 percent respectively than the preceding
12-month period. The Corresponding increases for Hang Seng CPI
and Composite CPI were 8.9 and 8.3 percent respectively.

<P>
KUNMING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The State Education Commission
(SEC) is seriously concerned about providing educational
opportunities to children whose parents travel around the country
in search of employment.
</P>
<P>
Urban schools might be required to open to these children on
weekends, and during the summer and winter vacations.
</P>
<P>
An SEC official attending an international workshop on primary
and middle-school education in the 21st century in this capital of
southwest China's Yunnan Province, suggested that retired teachers
might be recruited for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
The floating population throughout China now totals about 80
million, and the problem of education for their children is
becoming acute.
</P>
<P>
Schools in Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin cities, south China's
Guangdong Province, east China's Zhejiang Province and north
China's Hebei Province started trial education for such children
in March.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Encourages Growth of Hi-Tech Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior official has called for a
greater scale and more efficient operation of enterprises in the
country's new and hi-tech zones.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, minister in charge of the State Science and
Technology Commission, made the call today at a seminar held in
this capital of Shaanxi Province, which aims promote the sound
growth of new and hi-tech zones.
</P>
<P>
The zones should fully display the advantage of local resources
to boost key industrial projects, he said, adding that both
central and provincial governments should co-operate to manage the
hi-tech zones properly.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are 52 new and hi-tech zones across the country
at the national level, most of which are situated in the
economically booming eastern part of China.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years the hi-tech zones should also make
more contacts and co-operation with the western and central parts
of the country so as to achieve common development, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he called on local governments to take active
measures to introduce more advanced scientific achievements and
talented people to the hi-tech zones.
</P>
<P>
The zones themselves should also step up the training of
entrepreneurs and managers, especially younger ones.
</P>
<P>
Song noted that the new and hi-tech zones have made marked
achievements over the past few years and boosted the sustained,
sound and rapid development of the national and local economies.
</P>
<P>
He said the development of hi-tech industries will decide the
future fate of China as new and high technologies have become a
focus of global economic competition.
</P>
<P>
The hi-tech zones must optimize their industrial structure and
improve the quality of their products to achieve sustainable
development, he said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Fuels Speculation of Grachev's Sacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today fueled speculation he intends to sack his defense minister
Pavel Grachev by meeting the man widely rumored to be his
replacement.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin held talks with former deputy defense minister General
Boris Gromov, a deputy in the State Duma (lower house of
parliament) and one of his campaigners.
</P>
<P>
But Gromov, an Afghan war hero and opponent of the 17-month
conflict in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, refused to comment
on what was discussed at the meeting or on speculation that he
will be appointed defense minister.
</P>
<P>
However, the president's spokesman Sergei Medvedev said the two
men discussed military reform and the campaign for the
presidential election on June 16.
</P>
<P>
Kremlin sources also confirmed that the two men "paid much
attention to the issues of reforming the armed forces and ways of
implementing the recent decrees of the president on the gradual
transition in the manning of the armed forces to a contract basis."
</P>
<P>
Gromov, 52, the commander who led the Soviet military
withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989 and now a deputy of the State
Duma was dismissed as deputy defense minister in March 1995 after
his row with Grachev over the Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
He openly supports Yeltsin's plan on military reform announced
last week, which Grachev opposes.
</P>
<P>
Long-standing rumors of Grachev's sacking have been growing
after Gromov, not Grachev, accompanied Yeltsin to attend V-day
celebrations on May 9 in Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also pledged earlier this month to reshuffle his
government after opposition party leaders, including the reformist
Yabloko bloc leader Grigory Yavlinsky, demanded the sacking of
several ministers, including Grachev, as a condition for
supporting Yeltsin's re-election.
</P>
<P>
Some observers have speculated that Yeltsin may sack Grachev
during or after his expected tour of Chechnya later this
month.

<HEADLINE> 1,000 Workers Occupy Ammunition Shops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 striking workers at
a Russian defense company today broke past armed guards and
occupied the shops of enterprises producing explosives and
ammunition in a protest over unpaid wages.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the action was staged to
force the administration of the instrument-making plant in the
city of Murom, 340 kilometers east of Moscow, to pay back wages
for five months.
</P>
<P>
Pyotr Kaurov, governor of Murom, told reporters that the
takeover took both the authorities and the company's strike
committee completely by surprise.
</P>
<P>
He said the plant's administration is seriously concerned about
what the workers plan to do with the explosives in the shops.
</P>
<P>
The company owes workers more than 5 billion roubles (1 million
U.S. dollars) in back pay and the government owes the plant over
40 billion roubles (8 million dollars), the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Now, local authorities are holding urgent talks with the
Savings Bank on a two-billion-rouble (400,000 dollars) credit line
to allow the firm to pay the workers part of what they are owed.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, IMF Open Talks on Dropping Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) opened a new round of talks here today aiming to reach
an accord on forgiving Egypt some 4 billion U.S. dollars of debts.
</P>
<P>
The sum is the third and last installment of Egypt's debts
which Western creditor nations of the Paris Club have agreed to
write off in support of Egypt's economic reform program launched
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The two sides would discuss the second phase of Egypt's
economic reform, which began in the second half of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, which represents the Western creditor nations, has
delayed writing off the debts citing the slow pace of Egypt's
economic reform.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the reform is mainly aimed at reducing the
budget deficit, promoting production and exports, lowering the
inflation rate, creating more jobs and quickening the pace of the
privatization of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The talks came just one day after the Egyptian Cabinet decided
to take a number of measures to boost investments, considered a
key factor in Egypt's future economic development.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri heads the Egyptian side at the
talks, while the IMF mission is led by Abdul Shakur Sha'lan, the
executive director of the Middle East Administration of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Since Ganzouri was appointed prime minister last January, Egypt
has quickened its pace of privatizing state-owned enterprises. The
World Bank has praised Egypt's reform drive.
</P>
<P>
Egypt expects the new round of talks to have positive results.

<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Officials with China's Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC), say that a Memorandum of
Understanding on Cooperation in Securities and Futures Regulation
signed today heralds a new era of Sino-Australian cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the CSRC, China's securities watchdog,
and the Australian Securities Commission was a year in the making
and is expected to "lay a sound foundation for Chinese enterprises
to raise funds in Australia, a major capital market in the world,"
according to a CSRC official.
</P>
<P>
One of China's major policies is to raise funds on the
international capital market, and this "will play a positive role
in promoting Chinese enterprises to be listed in Australia," the
official noted.
</P>
<P>
China selected the first state enterprise to issue B-shares,
which are strictly for overseas investors, on domestic stock
exchanges in 1991. So far, 70 state enterprises in the country
have issued B-shares, raising 2.45 billion US dollars in foreign
capital.
</P>
<P>
Since China began experimenting with issuing shares on overseas
stock markets in 1993, 23 state enterprises have issued shares
abroad, 21 in Hong Kong and two in New York. They have raised a
total of 4.3 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC has MOUs with counterparts in Hong Kong, the United
States, and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Steel Producer Urged to combat Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- An environmental inspection group
has urged the Capital Iron and Steel Corporation (Shougang), one
of China's steel giants, to make greater efforts to solve
pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
The group, consisting of members of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress, China's highest legislature,
conducted an inspection of air and water pollution conditions
around Shougang.
</P>
<P>
The corporation has a great environmental impact on the capital
because it is situated to the windward side of Beijing and
upstream on areas of water sources, officials with the group said.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the 1970s, the steel producer has been working hard
on improving environmental conditions in the vicinity. However,
air pollution remains serious, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the Shijingshan District, where Shougang
is situated, covers only five-thousandths of the city's territory
but releases 55 percent of the city's waste gases, including 51
percent of its sulphur dioxide, 61 percent of its nitrous oxide,
75 percent of its carbon monoxide and 50 percent of its dust.
</P>
<P>
Shougang is the major pollution causer, said the officials, who
also noted that the corporation's waste water does not reach the
municipal standard for disposal and causes serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
The officials stressed that the corporation should become more
aware of the importance of protecting the environment while
raising its profits.

<P>
This is the major common understanding reached between China
and Pakistan during the visit to Pakistan by a high-level Chinese
delegation led by Sun Fuling, vice chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>

all walks of life on the further enhancement of the traditional
Sino-Pakistan friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
They expressed belief that the Sino-Pakistan friendship has
struck deep roots in the hearts of the two peoples and will
further flourish in future.

"The Sino-Pakistan friendly and cooperative relationship has
become a model for countries with different social systems," Sun
said, noting that the bilateral cooperation has made remarkable
achievements in the fields of politics, economy, defense and
culture.
</P>
<P>
He said both China and Pakistan are peace-loving countries and
China appreciates the peaceful, independent and non-aligned
foreign policy pursued by Pakistan and highly values Pakistan's
support for China in the regional and international affairs.

According to Senate Chairman Sajjad, "the Pakistan-China
friendly ties will help sustain and develop world peace."
</P>

"It is the cornerstone of the Pakistani foreign policy to
develop the friendly ties with China," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Sajjad said Pakistan and China share common or similar views on
various international issues and the two countries have no
conflict on basic issues.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the new international situation requires Pakistan
and China to cooperate more closely to jointly counter foreign
pressure.

In his meeting with Sun, Speaker of Pakistani National Assembly
Yousaf Gilani said that Pakistan and China enjoy sound cooperation
in all fields.
</P>
<P>
He added that Pakistan is grateful to the Chinese government
and its people for their support and assistance in times of need
during the past decades.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China's 380 million children will
soon have their own home-grown cartoon heroes to follow.
</P>
<P>
The country - backed by the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China - wants to break the hold of foreign imported
cartoons.
</P>
<P>
It means that American favorites like Mickey Mouse and Donald
Duck will have new rivals - developed and created in China.
</P>
<P>
To advance the march of the cartoon age China has built a new
cartoon publication base in Chengdu city of southwest China's
Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
The base plans to publish 62 cartoon books by the end of this
year for juveniles and children.
</P>
<P>
A cartoon producing unit has already been set up in Chengdu to
work on cartoon books and movies for children.
</P>
<P>
China has established three cartoon publication bases - one in
Beijing and neighboring Tianjin, and the other two in Shanghai,
and south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The new cartoon publication base in Chengdu, headed by Sichuan
Juveniles and Children Publishing House, includes northwest
China's Shaanxi Future Publishing House, central China's Hubei
Juveniles and Children Publishing House, southwest China's Yunnan
Chenguang Publishing House, and Sichuan Emei Film Studio.
</P>
<P>
Guangming Daily reported today that the establishment of
cartoon publication bases aims to break the market monopoly of
foreign cartoon books in China. Chinese children will soon have
Chinese cartoon heroes of their own.
</P>
<P>
The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China and the Press and Publication
Administration jointly launched a vitalization project for cartoon
publications in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the project China is building five cartoon publication
bases, publishing 15 cartoon book serials, and five cartoon
magazines for children.
</P>
<P>
"A group of cartoon reading material with both national
characteristics and rich contents have been devised since the
Chinese Cartoon project was launched several months ago," said Yu
Hong, director of the cartoon editing department of the Beijing
Children Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
There are 380 million children in China, accounting for
one-third of China's total population.

parliament yesterday that the resettlement programme would now be
sped up following the formation of a land identification
committee.
</P>

The committee, whose responsibility would be to identify land
in each province for acquisition and resettlement would be
chaired by the resident ministers and governors in the eight
provinces, according to the deputy minister.
</P>

He said the government had been unable to resettle as many
people it wanted due to lack of funds and land.

Sixteen years after independence, only 66,850 families had
been resettled as of March 30 this year, with 78,895 families on
the waiting list for resettlement.

SEOUL, May 23 (Xinhua) -- South Korea today welcomed the
initialing of a document on protecting international personnel
involved in building light-water nuclear reactors in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic privileges, immunities and consular protection
protocol was initialed Wednesday by the DPRK and the Korea
Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) in New York, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the protocol guarantees the rights and legal basis
for KEDO personnel to work effectively in the DPRK, the South
Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it "paved the way
for the KEDO to proceed with" the DPRK's nuclear reactor project.
</P>
<P>
Under the document, the KEDO will enjoy diplomatic privileges
and immunities similar to those granted to international
organizations like the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the KEDO staff and government representatives from
KEDO member countries will be accorded privileges and immunities
similar to those given to diplomats.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement reached between the DPRK and the
United States in Malaysia in June last year, the KEDO, a
multinational consortium led by the United States, South Korea and
Japan, is responsible for supplying two reactors to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-Pyongyang Geneva framework agreement signed in
October 1994 stipulates that two 1,000-megawatt light-water
nuclear reactors will be provided to the DPRK in return for
freezing its nuclear program. The KEDO has selected South Korea
as the prime supplier of the light-water reactors.

<HEADLINE> Poland Takes Measures to Curb Rising Food Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Polish government has taken a
series of measures to curb the soaring prices for food staples,
meat and dairy products including boosting grain production and
lowering import tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The amount of low-interest loans available for agriculture this
year has been trebled to 630 million zlotys (243 million
U.S. dollars) from 210 million zlotys (81 million dollars) last
year and halted or restricted the export of some commodities.
</P>
<P>
Food prices began to rise at the beginning of the year, with
grain price increases being followed by hikes in processed food,
meat, dairy products.
</P>
<P>
Grain prices in April were up 77 percent on the same time last
year at 57 zlotys (22 dollars) per 100 kilograms, and up 10.3
percent on March.
</P>
<P>
The dire situation has been exacerbated by the late spring
planting season which will lead to lower grain output later this
year.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview on Thursday, Polish Prime Minister
Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said food prices will continue to rise
over the next two or three months.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that the government must cut the profits of
middlemen who have a big influence on prices.
</P>
<P>
The government is planning a special agricultural meeting to
deal with the problem.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Ruling Party Willing to Talk with Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The top leader of South Korea's
ruling New Korea Party (NKP) said today his party is willing to
talk with the opposition to settle the current political impasse.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hong-koo, Chairman of the NKP, told a press conference that
the purpose of the his party's initiative is to assure that the
15th National Assembly can open on time.
</P>
<P>
"We will strive to do all we can for solving the political
confrontation so that the 15th legislature will be organized as
provided by the National Assembly law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee also formally proposed meetings with main opposition
leaders, Kim Dae-jung of the National Conference for New Politics
(NCNP) and Kim Jong-pil of the United Liberal Democrats (ULD).
</P>
<P>
"I would still like to meet with the presidents of the two
opposition parties," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the ruling party's recruitment of lawmakers-elect,
Lee brushed aside the opposition's criticism, claiming that "the
NKP's intention to conduct responsible politics with a parliament
majority should not be a cause for denunciation and struggle."
</P>
<P>
The current political impasse has been triggered by the ruling
party's recruitment of 11 independent and opposition
lawmakers-elect to secure a majority at the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th South Korean National Assembly elections held on
April 11, the NKP headed by President Kim Young-sam won 139 seats,
11 short of a simple majority in the 299-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties denounced the ruling party for
recruiting independent and opposition lawmakers and asked for a
thorough investigation of all alleged election campaign
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
They also declared that they will boycott the new parliament,
which will open early next month, if the ruling party fails to
meet their demand.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Fossil of Monkey Living 10,000 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Two scientists have discovered in
the Amazon jungle what was believed to be the fossil of a giant
monkey living more than 10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The scientists, Cartelle of the Universidad Federal de Minas
Gerais in Brazil and Walter Hartwig of George Washington
University of the United States, reported the finding in the
journal Nature published today.
</P>
<P>
The monkey, named Protopithecus brasiliensis, partly after the
place of its origin, lived in the treetops of the jungle in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Estimated to be twice as big as the present South American
counterparts, the ancient species, weighing about 25 kilograms,
had strong arms and a huge voice-box.
</P>
<P>
A complete skeleton of the animal was recovered, for the first
time, from a cave in the Brazilian state of Bahia.
</P>
<P>
The scientists assumed that the monkey went extinct as a result
of insufficient food caused by climate changes, mainly drier
weathers, on the continent over the 10,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The finding, they said, also suggested that South America was
more fertile then than it is today.

KUWAIT CITY, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia expressed
satisfaction with the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food agreement allowing
Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil in the world market after six
years of embargo, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a delayed official response to the agreement, an official of
the Saudi Arabian Foreign Ministry was quoted by SPA as saying
late Wednesday that "the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has always
strongly supported the efforts of the U.N. Security Council to
secure humanitarian needs for the fraternal Iraqi people and
sought to speed up the implementation" of the various
U.N. resolutions in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.N. reached an agreement Monday on implementing
U.N. resolution 986 to allow Baghdad to sell two billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil in the world market in six months to buy
medicine and food badly needed by the sanction-stricken Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed curbs, including oil embargo, on Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia was a part of the allied forces led by the
U.S. to drive the Iraqi occupation army out of Kuwait in the 1991
Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus International State Fair Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
opened the 21st Cyprus International State Fair Wednesday night
with a pledge to promote the island to be a hub of cooperation in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, President Clerides said
that the fair provides an opportunity for the projection of
business achievements, promotion of trade relations and
development of export trade.
</P>
<P>
"Our firm aim is to turn Cyprus into a meeting point and a hub
of cooperation among the countries and the peoples of our region
for our mutual benefit," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Describing the condition of the economy as stable, the
President said that "in 1996 the rate of growth is expected to be
about 4 percent, which is considered satisfactory and compares
favorably with the rate of growth of the European Union and the
international economy in general."
</P>
<P>
"Our economy in 1995 satisfied all Maastricht Treaty
convergence criteria," Clerides said, adding that the inflation
in 1995 was reduced and the unemployment kept in a low level.
</P>
<P>
Other than the business sector, the President noted, the
government also promotes the sectors of tourism, offshore
activities, export services and transit trade. "A sound, stable
and growing economy is not only a factor contributing to the
welfare and progress of our people but also the secure foundation
of our struggle for national survival and vindication," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Cyprus is utilizing its important
strategic position in the eastern Mediterranean to "serve the
wider strategic aims of the international community for peace,
stability, progress and prosperity of all the people of the
region."
</P>
<P>
This year's fair, which runs until June 2, boasts 500 kiosks
covering 41,500 square meters and with the products and services
of over 1,600 companies from 40 countries.

<HEADLINE> Indian New Parliament Speaker Elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Joint opposition candidate Purno
A. Sangma was today unanimously elected speaker of the 11th Lok
Sabha (lower house of Indian parliament) in virtually the first
show of strength against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) minority
government, the Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
The motion for consensus election of 48-year-old Sangma was
carried by the house by a voice vote as the ruling BJP decided to
avoid any embarrassing show-down by not fielding its candidate.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a ruling party candidate will not
occupy the speaker's chair.
</P>
<P>
The election of the former information and broadcasting
minister became clear even a few days ago when the opposition
Congress Party and United Front decided on his name and the BJP
opted out of the race.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the election, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
and the leader of the opposition P.V. Narasimha Rao conducted
Sangma to the speaker's chair, which he occupied.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee, Rao and other leaders of the opposition congratulated
Sangma on his election and pledged full cooperation to him in the
smooth functioning of the house.

<HEADLINE> US Marines To Remain In Monrovia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The united states marines and other
troops, sent last month to protect the U.S. embassy in monrivia,
will remain indefinitely in the Liberian capital, said a U.S.
information agency report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
''We do not intend that U.S. armed forces deployed to Liberia
become involved in the hostilities,'' it quoted president Bill
MM our forces are equipped and prepared to defend
American lives and property if necessary,'' said Cliton.
</P>
<P>
Spiralling viollence between warring plh|Z1factions has
engulfed the Liberian capital of monrovia, causing tens of
thousands of Liberians and other Nationals to flee to safety.
</P>
<P>
U.S. helicopters last month managed to evacuate over 2,300
non-liberians from Monrovia, including more than 470 U.S.
citizens. A number of warships and marines are off Liberia's
coast, ready to conduct further evacuations if needed.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of armed clashes in Monrivia started on April
6 when the ''government troops'' led by the country's two largest
warlords, Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah, tried to arrest
another faction leader, Roosevelt Johnsom.
</P>
<P>
A new ceasefire has yet to be installed with fighting still
hanging on in Monrovia, casting doubts on the peace prospects in
the west African state torn apart by over six years of civil war.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Breed New Deer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
successfully bred a new high-yield variety of red deer.
</P>
<P>
It took Chinese scientists 22 years to breed the new variety of
the deer, the first such kind in the world, sources from the
Chinese Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The new breed is based on a selection of Tianshan red deers
from northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Qingyuan variety of Tianshan red deer is bigger than the
original Tianshan red deer in shape, stronger, and has fat, big
and fresh antlers.
</P>
<P>
The fresh antlers of each deer weigh 7.857 kilograms, and in
1994 the finished antlers of each deer weigh 3.194 kilograms and
93 percent are quality ones.
</P>
<P>
The newly-bred red deer can produce antlers for 15 consecutive
years, and some 60 percent of such deers can survive.
</P>
<P>
These deers are easy to feed, and seldom become ill, according
to Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
Material from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural and Forestry
Sciences shows that the average weight of first batch of fresh
antlers and re-produced fresh antlers of each deer stood at 7.857
kilograms in 1994, one-third heavier than that of Tianshan red
deer.
</P>
<P>
An 11-year old deer has already made history by producing 23.75
kilograms of fresh antlers and 9.3 kilograms of finished antlers.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have cross-bred this kind of deer with red
deer of northeast China and popularized 10,000 hybrid deers in
five provinces and autonomous regions in northeast and north
China, producing an added value of 55 million yuan in profits.

<HEADLINE> Somali Town of Huddor Falls Into Hands of RRA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Somalia's Southwestern town of
Huddur is reported to have fallen in the hands of the Rahanwein
Resistance Army (RRA) yesterday following a heavy battle between the
militiamen of General Aidid who occupied the town on January 17
this year and those of RRA.
</P>
<P>
According to North Mogadishu radio
controlled by Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed, RRA forces have attacked the
town from two directions and managed to confine General Aidid's
men in one nook of the town before they were totally dislodged
from Huddor, 450 Km Southwest of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the victory of RRA is a victory for all Somalis,
adding that the RRA will further continue its insurgence on
General Aidid's men until they leave the last centimeter of their
territories. RRA fighters are
still hunting for those of General Aidid in the surrounding
villages, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued in Mogadishu last night, RRA
claimed that their forces have killed 90 people and wounded many
more others during the six hours long fighting in which they
forced General Aidid's men to flee Huddor.
</P>
<P>
The statement also
said three technicals belonging to General Aidid's men were
neutralized during the raid. However, other sources put the
casualty fighures down to 34 and only one armed wagon
neutralized.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, RRA has lost only five
fighters and suffered 10 other wounded. RRA usually minimizes the
casualty fighure on their side.
</P>
<P>
RRA said their victory was facilitated by the recent heavy
rain in the region which cut off all non-tarmac roads leading to
Huddor. It is also believed that land mines were buried in the
tarmac road before Huddor was attacked so as to prevent any
militia reinforcement from Baidoa where General aidid still
controls.
</P>
<P>
General Aidid has been relocating his militiamen from the
Rahanwein territories steadily ever since the armed conflict has
begun between his militiamen and those of his former financier,
Mr Osman Hassan Ali Atto, in South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
This is the first major militia set back for General Aidid
after the loss of Beletuein to the Hawadle clan last year. The
militia set back of General Aidid is attributed to political
split among the Habar Gidir clan politicians after Osman Atto has
ousted General Aidid from the chairmanship of USC/SNA in the
middle of last year. Both General Aidid and Osman Atto belong to
the Sa'ad subclan of Habar Gidir.
</P>
<P>
Radio South Mogadishu supporting General Aidid did not mention
the fighting in Huddor, but instead kept encouraging the people
to pay what they called the governmental tax on all business
items being imported from abroad the country.

<HEADLINE> Mahmoud Abbas Named Arafat's Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Senior Palestinian official
Mahmoud Abbas would succeed Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat as head of the PLO if the Palestinian
leader were to die, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Palestinian official as saying that Arafat
had named Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, his deputy four months
ago, in a step never made public.
</P>
<P>
"If, God forbid, something were to happen to Arafat, (on his
death) Abu Mazen takes over," said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
Executive Committee elected Abbas its secretary-general, formally
confirming his position as deputy to 67-year-old Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"The Executive Committee has elected Abu Mazen as its
secretary-general, and officially, he acts as second man (to
Arafat), according to PLO regulations," PLO information chief
Yasser Abded Rabbo said.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, 61, one of the founders of the PLO and of Arafat's
mainstream Fatah faction, was a main architect of the 1993
Israeli-Palestinian Oslo peace accord which led to the
Palestinian autonomy in much of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
According to Palestinian sources, Abu Mazen has already been
acting as the PLO's second-ranking official in the absence of
Farouk Kaddoumy, head of the Political Department of the PLO, who
opposes the Oslo accord and remains in Tunis.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israel Television Channel 2 reported
last week that Arafat had suffered a mild stroke, following a
visit to Cairo to attend the three-way summit between Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's King Hussein and himself.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian leader's personal doctor later
dismissed the report as "totally untrue," saying Arafat has
been sick, suffering from flu and exhaustion, but has not
had a stroke.
</P>
<P>
The doctor stressed that he found "no serious illness,"
after conducting "routine medical checkups" on Arafat in Gaza.

<HEADLINE> China, the Netherlands Sign Aviation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China and the Netherlands signed a
civil aviation agreement in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guangyi, director of the Civil Aviation Administration of
China (CAAC), and D. J. van Houten, the Netherlands' ambassador to
China, signed the document on behalf of their respective
governments.
</P>
<P>
With the agreement, designated carriers of the two countries
can operate regular passenger and cargo flights between Beijing
and Amsterdam, and chartered cargo flights between Amsterdam and
the south China city of Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Dutch Airlines will open the first direct flight
between Beijing and Amsterdam on June 26, on a twice-a-week
basis. And China Southern Airlines has been designated by the CAAC
 as the Chinese carrier to fly the Sino-Dutch routes.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the signing ceremony, van Houten called the
agreement the most important one he has signed in his four-year
stay in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the volume of visitors between China and
the Netherlands has surged in recent years, and the current
agreement enables the establishment of a direct link between the
two countries for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Amsterdam, he added, in its capacity as both a seaport and an
airport open to Chinese cargos and passengers, will become an
important link between China and the world.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guangyi emphasized the importance the Chinese government
has attached to Sino-Dutch ties.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the aviation agreement will help expand
bilateral political, economic, trade and cultural exchanges, and
promote China's relations with Europe and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
This is the 71st civil aviation agreement China has signed with
other countries, and the third this year, Chen revealed. The
country is to sign an agreement with Lebanon later this year.
</P>
<P>
So far China has established air links with 56 cities in 39
countries and regions across the world. And 40 airlines from 34
countries are operating flights to China.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Poll Campaign Kicks Off in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's four major political
parties kicked off formal hustings on Wednesday for the scheduled
June 12 general elections with their candidates and supporters
across the country holding rallies, processions and parades to woo
the voters.
</P>
<P>
The main four parties are the Awami (people's) League (AL), the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the Jatiya (national) Party
(JP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami. According to the Representation of
the People's Order, parties and candidates can begin their
campaigns only three weeks before the day of polling.
</P>
<P>
BNP chairperson and former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia
launched her party's campaign by addressing several public
meetings in the northern districts of Mymensingh and Jamalpur.
</P>
<P>
She called on the people of all strata to cast votes in favor
of the ex-ruling party to protect the national independence,
nourish democracy and turn Bangladesh into an economic "Asian
Tiger."
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina, president of the AL, the former largest
opposition party in the country, staged the AL's campaign through
a tour in parts of the capital city of Dhaka, urging the people to
give the AL another chance to serve the nation by forgiving past
mistakes, if any, during its three-year rule in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a total of 2,572 candidates are contesting
for the 300 parliamentary seats in the coming polls.
</P>
<P>
In fact, most political parties and their candidates have much
earlier undertaken their electioneering in terms of "unofficial"
or "mass contact" while all the major parties have also announced
their respective poll manifestoes earlier.
</P>
<P>
In its manifesto announced on May 18, the BNP pledged to
complete its unfinished task in turning Bangladesh into a happy
and healthy country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The BNP has generally promised to protect constitution and
democratic system, not to renew the 25-year friendship treaty
signed with India in 1972, to solve water sharing issue of the
Ganges permanently, to maintain liberal and free market economy
and to make campuses terrorism-free.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the AL in its 21-point manifesto announced on May
11,  promised not to renew the friendship treaty with India, to
equip armed forces suitably, to follow liberal economic policy, to
subsidize agricultural sector, to strengthen the local government
system, to separate judiciary from executive, and to make
state-owned radio and TV stations autonomous.
</P>
<P>
There are no essential differences between the manifestos of
the two major rival parties, observers here said, adding that the
only purpose of their quarrels is to win the power through legal
elections.
</P>
<P>
The two rivals have used every chance to attack each other in
order to reach their end. In recent days, they have exchanged
attacks to foil the poll process following an attempted mutiny on
Monday by some troops loyal to the just deposed chief of army
staff after he was given forced retirement by the Defense Ministry
under President Abdur Rahman Biswas.
</P>
<P>
The AL alleged that the mutiny was a "planned conspiracy" to
undermine the authority of the non-party caretaker government
while demanding that the caretaker government, instead of the
president, be equipped with all authorities of the armed forces
and civil administration.
</P>
<P>
But the BNP denied the allegation and thanked the army for
foiling the AL-led plot to create divisions in the army and to
disrupt the democratic process and the June 12 polls.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the poll will be held on the
schedule, but the political situation in Bangladesh is likely to
be uncertain as the government-opposition conflict will still
exist even after the election.

<HEADLINE> China bans unauthorized expeditions to ancient ruins in desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China has banned unauthorized
expeditions and tourist groups from Loulan and Niya, two
world-known Buddhist city ruins in the country's northwestern
Takalamakan Desert.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting of the government of
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to protect the two
archaeological sites from being damaged or even looted.
</P>
<P>
Niya, located in the heartland of Takalamakan and Loulan
located at Lop Nur on the edge of the desert, were two prosperous
Buddhist cities 2,000 years ago on the legendary Silk Roads.
</P>
<P>
The two cities had been buried by sand since the decline
of the ancient trade route about 1,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
But the discoveries of a dozen mummies with Caucasian features
from the two sites by archaeologists in recent years has inspired
amateur archaeologists, adventurers and tourist agencies, both at
home and abroad, to organize intrepid expeditions to the ruined
towns.
</P>
<P>
People who enter the ruined cites without the permission of the
cultural relics administrative departments will be investigated
and dealt with according to law, according to the State
Administration of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang local government urges archaeologists to
collaborate with petroleum companies, who are drilling oil in
the desert, for the protection of the archaeological sites.
</P>
<P>
"Any damage to cultural relics and ancient ruins will not be
tolerated," an official from the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Cultural Relics has only issued
official permission to Sino-Japanese Scientific Expeditions
financed by Japanese Buddhist monk Wasutaka Kojima into Niya since
1993.

<P>
HANOI, May 23 (Xinhua)-- Vietnam has imported 52,000 tonnes of
paper during the first four months of this year, more than the

</P>
<P>
Sources from the Ministry of Trade and Ministry of Industry
said that this year the country needs between 250,000 and 253,000
tonnes of paper, with the Vietnam Paper Corporation contributing
132,000 tonnes and other paper enterprises 74,500 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Local paper market is deficient by 43,500 to 45,000 tonnes, but
domestic paper factories haven't produced to their full capacities.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Vietnam Paper Corporation has proposed that the
government impose policies to protect domestic production.
</P>
<P>
The proposals include stopping imports of writing paper,
general printing paper and newspaper in the short-term, and in the
long-term increasing the tax rates on imports from the current
rate of 20 percent to 40 percent for writing paper and from 10 to
20 percent for newspaper.

This all adds up to a lucrative market for overseas investors,
say communications experts.
</P>
<P>
Last year the country had 3.63 million mobile phones users, a
rise of 131.6 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
And in the next five years, the country expects to add almost
15 million mobile phones subscribers to that number.
</P>
<P>
China's annual demand for mobile phones during the 1996-2000
period is estimated to range from 1.8 million to 2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
To increase its share of China's mobile communications market,
Sweden's Ericsson has introduced its improved GSM 388 model of
mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
Today more than 60 percent of the analog and digital mobile
phone users in China are served by Ericsson. The company had more
than 1.2 billion US dollars in sales in China last year.
</P>
<P>
China has become the third largest market for Ericsson's
products worldwide, with its net sales in China last year
accounting for eight percent of its world total.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Ericsson had poured more than 100
million US dollars' worth of investment into the China market. It
now has 13 offices and seven joint ventures in China.

<HEADLINE> Panic Withdrawals From Troubled Thai Bank Subside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Withdrawals by depositors from the
embattled Bangkok Bank of Commerce (BBC) have slowed down.
</P>
<P>
Panic withdrawals have slowed from one billion baht (40 million
US dollars) a day last week to 200 million baht (8 million
dollars) on Wednesday, according to BBC Acting President Samrong
Vanichayanonda.
</P>
<P>
Since the opposition revealed the poor condition of the bank
during the May 8-10 censure debate, the bank has lost about 12-13
billion baht (480-520 million dollars) in deposits.
</P>
<P>
The opposition claimed that the bank had extended substantial
loans to a group of politicians, including some government deputy
ministers, on overvalued collateral, driving the bank further into
red.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that at the start of this year, BBC was over 6
billion baht (240 million dollars) in red and now it has bad and
doubtful debts to the tune of 78 billion baht (3.12 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Last week the central bank injected more than 10 billion baht
(400 million dollars) to shore up the bank.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 78 billion baht bad and doubtful debts, half is
said to have been extended to the politicians and the other half
to companies belonging to BBC President Krirkkiat Jalichandra.
</P>
<P>
Among deputy ministers involved in the scandals is Deputy
Interior Minister Suchart Tancharoen. Some coalition parties have
demanded his removal from the cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Determined to Seek More Supports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
al-Hariri is determined to make more diplomatic efforts to seek
international supports for his country, a statement issued at the
end of a cabinet meeting here Wednesday night announced.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting which was presided by President Elias
Hrawi, the prime minister briefed the Council of Ministers on
results of his recent visits to a number of "brotherly and
friendly" countries, especially the United Arab Emirates, the
Vatican and France, and his meetings with foreign ministers of
European Union (EU) countries in Brussels, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister stressed that the atmosphere of these
visits was good, and the responses he received over the Lebanese
suggestions were positive," the cabinet statement said. "He
believes that the next stage needs more pursuits and activities."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told the cabinet that he will continue his
visits to a number of brotherly and friendly countries, and will
visit Brussels later to follow up the talks.
</P>
<P>
Before the cabinet meeting, Hariri announced that a continuous
existence of the U.N. peace-keeping forces in south Lebanon "is
not a subject to the discussion in the (current) negotiations on
the formation of the security committee for monitoring cease-fire
in the framework of the April understanding."
</P>
<P>
As long as Israel rejects the implementation of U.N. Security
Council resolution 425 and prevents the execution of its texts,
there is still a need for the existence of the international
forces in south Lebanon, Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
After the United Nations published a controversial report on
its investigation into the Israeli bombardment at a U.N. base in
south Lebanon on April 18, in which over 100 Lebanese refugees
were killed and more others were wounded, Israeli officials have
repeatedly asked a departure of the U.N. peacekeeping forces from
south Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian daily today published on
the front page a photo of a Turkish diplomat who is alleged to
have killed two women in a traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Jomhuri Islami said in the report that the
Turkish diplomat is identified as Cank Karaduman.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish source told Xinhua that the diplomat is in late 20s
and serves as a third secretary in the embassy.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry Wednesday lodged a formal protest
against Turkey for killing two Iranian women in a traffic
accident.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that Turkish
Ambassador to Tehran Mithat Balkan was summoned to the Iranian
Foreign Ministry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry protested the carelessness of the Turkish
diplomat in driving, and his inhuman conduct for fleeing the scene
of the accident.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred in northern Tehran on Tuesday night, in
which the two Iranian women -- Tahereh Nabati, 49, and her
daughter Margan Pirani, 19 -- were allegedly killed by the Turkish
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted unidentified sources as saying that the
diplomat may have already left Iran, and most probably he is back
to Ankara now.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Turkish ambassador was called on
to carry out necessary cooperation with relevant organizations.
</P>
<P>
Balkan in response expressed his sorrows and sympathy on
behalf of the Turkish government and voiced the readiness of the
Turkish Embassy to cooperate with the law-enforcement authorities
to carry out investigations on the accident.

<P>
ROME, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Former Italian Prime Minister Bettino
Craxi and Foreign Minister Gianni de Michelis will stand on trial
in October for illegally raising fund for their Socialist Party, a
report said today.
</P>
<P>
A Rome court, after four days of deliberations, Wednesday
ordered the trial of Craxi and other 33 people including three
ambassadors and several businessmen, the Italian News Agency ANSA
said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the accused stole some of the millions of
dollars in funds supposed for projects in African, Latin American
and Asian countries and used them to finance the Socialist Party.
The businessmen were accused of helping arrange the transfer of
government cash.
</P>
<P>
Craxi, who was prime minister from 1983 to 1987 and is now
living in self-imposed exile in Tunisia, has already been
sentenced, in absentia, to four jail terms totaling more than 25
years in prison on charges of corruption.
</P>
<P>
Craxi has repeatedly denied the charges and said he is the
victim of a political feud.
</P>
<P>
De Michelis, Socialist foreign minister during 1990-92, was
condemned to four years in prison last year for taking bribes in
exchange for supporting highway construction in the northeast
Veneto region. He also denied all corruption charges against him.

<HEADLINE> NZ Government Announces Budget Through to 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government will
spend 15 billion NZ dollars (one dollar equals 0.68 US dollars) in
three major areas from the current year through to June 1998.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Finance Minister Bill Birch in Parliament
this afternoon in his "Budget and Fiscal Strategy Report 1996."
</P>
<P>
As a conventional practice, NZ's budget not only covers the
spending in the next year, but also the following two years.
</P>
<P>
The three major areas announced in the budget are: debt
repayment, priority social spending and tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
In the three years, 8 billion NZ dollars will go to debt
repayment. The government plans to cut net public debt from the
present 32 percent of gross domestic product to less than 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Priority social spending will get an extra funding of 3.7
billion NZ dollars in the period, mainly for family assistance,
health care, education and environment.
</P>
<P>
Tax cuts announced in February will take up 3.3 billion NZ
dollars  starting from the next fiscal year on July 1 1996.
</P>
<P>
Birch said the government operating surplus in 1995/96 amounts
to 3.9 billion NZ dollars, but will go down to 2.8 billion NZ
dollars next year because of tax cuts. The surplus will rise to
3.3 billion NZ dollars in 1997/98 and 4.9 billion NZ dollars the
following year.
</P>
<P>
The budget came as no surprise to the New Zealanders as many
funding boosts had already been announced by the Government, like
the tax cuts spending and increases for health and environmental
conservation.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts see education spending as the major news in the
budget, which receives a boost of 206 million NZ dollars over the
next three years.

<HEADLINE> Congressional Republicans Propose Welfare Reform, Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House and Senate
Republicans today unveiled a revised welfare legislation that
would urge people to work, rather than wait, for benefits and
limit government cash assistance to five years in lifetime.
</P>
<P>
"We believe people ought to work for their benefits. There
ought to be strict time limits (to cash assistance). We ought to
cut off welfare for non-citizens and felons and we ought to turn
welfare over to the states," House Ways and Means Chairman Bill
Archer, a Republican from Texas, said.
</P>
<P>
This would be Congress' third attempt in the past two years at
reforming the welfare system, following two presidential vetos.
</P>
<P>
A White House official has hinted that the bill will hardly win
approval of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"The president has made it clear that if Congress sends him a
clean welfare reform bill that requires work, promotes
responsibility and protects children he will sign it," Mary Bain,
Health and Human Services assistant secretary told a House
subcommittee today.
</P>
<P>
"However, as the president has noted, good welfare reform
should not be ruined by attaching bad proposals that shouldn't be
there in the first place," she added.
</P>
<P>
The White House opposes eliminating aid to all non-citizens and
has concerns about the Republican language on health care.
Clinton is also against linking sweeping welfare reform and
Medicaid fund cuts in a single bill as the Republicans have
proposed.
</P>
<P>
Medicaid, the country's chief health program, involves 36
million poor and disabled. About 14 million people are on public
assistance, 9 million of whom cannot work for a variety of
reasons, according to Bain.
</P>
<P>
However, Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, a
Republican from Delaware, insisted that the Medicaid system has to
be changed to give the states more flexibility.

<P>
HARARE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Minister of Lands,
Resettlement and Rehabilitation Pendukeni Ithana is in Zimbabwe to
study the Zimbabwe's land policy and resettlement programs as Namibia
prepares to review legislation to speed up land acquisition.
</P>
<P>
She said here yesterday that Namibia's initial land acquisition
legislation had not helped the country's 1.6 million people to
quickly redress land imbalances.
</P>
<P>
At least 30 percent of the population needed to be resettled and
the landless, especially excombatants, were becoming increasingly
restless, she said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 80 percent of the arable land is controlled by the white
minority of 10 percent of the population, while the majority was
crowded in overgrazed and arid areas, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, ''We are in the process of reviewing our own
legislation on land acquisition and before we do that, we are looking
at what other countries in the region did so that we can broaden our
horizon.''

<HEADLINE> African Visitors Save Chinese Man From Mouth of Wild Boar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese man in his sixties was
rescued by two African workers who saw him being viciously
attacked by a wild boar.
</P>
<P>
They ran to the rescue after hearing cries for help from Ji
Weiqiang, the doorkeeper of the Jinhua Steelcasting Factory in
east China's Zhejiang province.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Abdelmalek from Tunisia and J.E Mugyenzi from Uganda,
are in China attending a United Nations training course on small
hydro-power stations.
</P>
<P>
They were among the 43 foreign students from 22 Asian, African and
European countries who visited power stations located at Guohu and
Andi in Jinhua County.
</P>
<P>
On their way back, shouts of "Help! Help!" were heard from
nearby Jinhua Steelcasting Factory. A group of the visitors rushed
into the factory and found a wild boar biting the
blood-covered Ji.
</P>
<P>
At that time there was no body else in the factory.
</P>
<P>
Armed with a hoe and spade, Abdelmalek and Mugyenzi ran to the wild
boar and beat it, sending the wild boar fleeing into a
storage house, and the two African guests locked the door.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later more people arrived, including a hunter who shot
and killed the wild boar which weighed over 70 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Ji, who was seriously bitten on the shoulders and buttocks,
was immediately sent to a local hospital. After emergency
treatment he is making a good recovery.

MEXICO CITY, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Mexico is one of the countries
which have made significant progress in environmental protection,
head of Environmental Control and Evaluation for Honduras' Health
Ministry, Irasema Montaya Chan, said today.
</P>

Honduras and the other countries in the region, including
Mexico, are facing worsening environmental problems like
deforestation and water pollution, added Montaya Chan.

<HEADLINE> Labor Contract System to Be Implemented in Private Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities said all
private businesses in the country will have to sign labor
contracts with their employees.
</P>
<P>
"The work of fully applying the labor contract system to
private businesses will be completed by the end of the year,"
according to a circular jointly issued by the Labor Ministry, the
State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the China
Individual Laborers' Association recently.
</P>
<P>
Self-employed business people should also draw up contracts
with their trainees or employees if they have any, the circular
said.
</P>
<P>
The job of replacing China's "iron rice-bowl" with a new labor
system as set forth in the country's Labor Law has begun in all
areas of work, observers said, and over 80 percent of workers in
the state-owned enterprises have signed labor contracts with their
employers.
</P>
<P>
The decree said that such a system in private businesses is
intended "to defend the rights and interests of both employees and
employers, to better handle labor relations in accordance with the
law, and to promote the healthy development of private businesses."
</P>
<P>
Labor contracts must be agreed to under the principles of
equality, mutual willingness, and by unanimous decision, by
consultation, and in accordance with laws and regulations, and the
terms of contracts must be observed once they are signed.
</P>
<P>
Labor departments across the country should provide sufficient
policy references, recommend standard contract forms, increase
efforts to be certain contracts are legitimate to establish a
contract labor system as soon as possible, and to see that they
are observed, it said.
</P>
<P>
Industry and commerce bureaus and local workers associations
are expected to help the labor departments by urging private
businesses to implement the new system.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses that intentionally ignore the labor contract
system will be subjected to investigations and punishment in line
with the first Labor Law that took effect early last year.

YANGON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Deputy Minister for
Information U Thein Sein said here today that some members of the
National League for Democracy (NLD) had been called in for
questioning and the move was to preclude instability of the

members had been called in for questioning and they were not
arrested.

<HEADLINE> National Anti-Crime Drive Wins Public Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Ever since China launched the
anti-crime drive April 28, the general public has been actively
co-operating with the police to capture criminals.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of the criminal cases cracked in east China's
Shandong Province were the result of tipoffs from the general
public, who also positively helped the police capture 45 percent
of the criminals rounded up.
</P>
<P>
In Liaoning Province, northeast China, six out of the eight
major criminal cases were cracked as a direct consequence of
information provided by the general public.
</P>
<P>
On May 5, Xu Fengqi, a worker at the Zhangdian Iron and Steel
Plant in Shandong Province, turned over his fugitive son who had
been involved in a theft case to the local police station and
demanded that the police punish his son.
</P>
<P>
He even appeared on local television to urge the police and the
public to co-operate in the anti-crime crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an association of self-employed persons in Weifang
city of Shandong Province presented an inscribed board to praise
the local police's dedication to law and order.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Windy Days In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China's capital has fewer days of
strong winds and the dust storms that come in their wake. Massive
tree planting around Beijing takes the credit, according to
today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper, the country's leading newspaper, said that in the
1960s Beijing had 27 days of strong winds and 17 days of dust
storms on average a year.
</P>
<P>
During the 1971-1978 period the city had over 36.6 days of
strong winds and 20.5 days of dust.
</P>
<P>
But since the beginning of the 1990s the number of days of
strong winds has dropped to a yearly average of 18, and that of
days of dust to 12.
</P>
<P>
Beijing currently has 6.8 million hectares of trees, the paper
said, adding that green space covers 36 percent of the city's land
mass.

<HEADLINE> Stronger Private Spending Dampens Australian Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Strong private business and
consumer spending so far this year has dampened the hopes of
interest rate cuts in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today that
private capital spending in the first three months of this year
rose by 2.7 percent compared with the previous quarter on a
seasonally adjusted basis.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures released today also showed that total new motor
vehicle registration rose by a seasonally adjusted 3.7 percent in
April over March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, private businesses are planning to spend 11.4
percent more than expected in capital in the fiscal year of
1996-97. Earlier figures also showed that people had been
spending more on housing since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Relatively strong consumer demands have pinned down the
continuous growth of the Australian economy. Increases in private
capital spending also helped to remove the need for an immediate
interest rate cut to revitalize the economy.
</P>
<P>
Some local economists are concerned that the present level of
interest rates might push the already weakened economy into a
recession. The official interest rates are among the highest in
the West, standing at 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
High interest rates helped to cool down the economy from a
5.8-percent annual growth rate in 1994 to a 3.25-percent rate as
forecasted by the federal Treasury recently.
</P>
<P>
However, unemployment showed signs of declining after peaking
at 8.9 percent in April. The inflation rate also dropped to 3.7
percent annually as wages growth stabilized.
</P>
<P>
Australia is expected to have a record 19 quarters of
continuous economic growth in the country's history when the March
quarter result is published next week.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth is expected to be accelerated to around four
percent annually in 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Newspaper Urges Permanent MFN for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Journal of Commerce today
urged an end to the annual debate on China's most-favored-nation
(MFN) status and called on U.S. Congress and the Clinton
administration to grant China permanent trading privileges.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper in its editorial "Grant China MFN" said that
after President Bill Clinton announced his decision to renew
China's MFN status, a core group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill are
predictably fighting it.
</P>
<P>
But the yearly battle on this issue "achieves nothing good,"
said the paper. "Since threats to cancel MFN are, for the most
part, not credible, they make the United States look feckless,
confuse our Asian allies and needlessly irritate the Chinese."
</P>
<P>
The paper stressed that withdrawing China's trading rights, as
some in Congress advocate, would harm U.S. interests in countless
ways. It called the annual process of renewing China's MFN "a
Cold War anachronism."
</P>
<P>
Withdrawing MFN was originally intended to force the former
Soviet Union to allow the emigration of Russian Jews, but the
process is now used in ways Congress never intended, and China is
today virtually the only nation still subjected to annual MFN
review, mainly because of human rights issues, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is alone in linking human rights to trade,
and "absent European and Japanese support, Washington's position
carries little weight," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the economic costs, especially for U.S. investors,
caused by the lack of permanent MFN for China, the newspaper
quoted General Motors chairman Jack Smith as saying earlier this
week that "while the United States is debating over China, Europe
is selling them Airbuses."
</P>
<P>
The editorial described Clinton's remark that MFN renewal "is
not a referendum on all China's policies" as an acknowledgement
that China can be neither isolated nor ignored.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that Clinton reinforce that view by "ending the
tortured MFN process" and supporting permanent trading rights for
China.

<HEADLINE> ICBC Bank Backs State Firms with Big Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC) has allocated 6.9 billion yuan (831 million
U.S. dollars) in working capital loans to support production in
286 key State-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the bank said the money is aimed at easing
capital shortages facing the enterprises. The second quarter is
usually a busy production season, when enterprises have peak
demand for capital.
</P>
<P>
Just over 200 of the enterprises, located in 50 major cities,
have absorbed 5.01 billion yuan of the loans--72.6 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials said that major sectors which have been given
priority include the metallurgical, machinery, chemicals,
petrochemicals, electronics, automobile and light industries.
</P>
<P>
Most of the money will be used as working capital to organize
production. But some enterprises are expected to use it to carry
out technical renovation projects.
</P>
<P>
According to the ICBC, the enterprises were selected on the
basis that their products are well-received on the market, they
are economically efficient, and they will not default on interest
payments.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the money went to the right places, the bank
organized a special group to investigate the performances and
capital situations of key State enterprises in over 20 provinces
and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
As China's leading supplier of working capital loans to
industrial and communication enterprises, the bank has, since last
year, tilted its loans towards the country's 1,000 key
enterprises, most of which are large and medium-sized State firms.
</P>
<P>
Last year it also allocated 6.3 billion yuan (759 million
U.S. dollars) in working capital loans to State key enterprises in
50 major cities.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials said these two batches of loans were arranged by
the headquarters of the bank which is compatible with the practice
of commercial banks, while on the other hand reflects the
reinforced capital management ability of the headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Cuba, Russia Sign Documents to Foster Closer Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Cuba and Russia signed two
agreements today to reinvigorate bilateral relations which have
stagnated since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The documents were signed by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto
Robaina and his Russian counterpart Evgeni Primakov after
their meeting in the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The "Declaration of the Principles of Reciprocal Relations
between Cuba and Russia" sets out the principles of
non-interference, equal rights and mutual benefit that should
govern their relationship.
</P>
<P>
The other document broadens cultural and scientific cooperation
between Cuba and Russia in 1996-1998.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's visit during a critical time demonstrated Russia's
political will to strengthen mutual ties, said Robaina. The two
agreements signed today will help to breathe new life into their
relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that the agreements laid the foundation for
expanding bilateral relations under new conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister, who arrived here Tuesday on a
three-day visit, will also meet with President Fidel Castro,
Vice-President Carlos Lage, Parliamentary President Ricardo
Alarcon and Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Cuba and Russia contracted considerably with
the break-up of the Soviet Union, Cuba's main trading partner and
aid donor, but have been reviving in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The last high-ranking Russian official to visit Cuba was First
Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets who came in November 1995 and
signed eight cooperation agreements with the Cuban government.

<HEADLINE> Indian National Congress Prefers to Sit in Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Indian National
Congress appears to prefer to sit in opposition rather than form a
new government or participate in a coalition in the event of the
fall of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) minority government, the
Times of Indian said today.
</P>
<P>
Party circles are of the view that the chances of President
Shankar Dayal Sharma inviting Congress Party leader P.V. Narasimha
Rao to form the government are dim, as his letter of support for
the United Front leader H.D. Deve Gowda is already with the
president.
</P>
<P>
The United Front, comprising the National Front-Left Parties
Combine and some regional parties, is poised to form a new
government with the outside support of the Congress Party if the
BJP government fails to survive a vote of confidence in the new
parliament scheduled for May 27.
</P>
<P>
"But even if Rao is invited to form the government, he will
turn down the offer," a senior Congress Party official said.
</P>
<P>
When the United Front constituents were struggling to elect
their leader about a week ago, some Congress Working Committee
(CWC, supreme decision-making body of the Congress Party) members
were in favor of supporting the Front government from outside with
the option of joining it at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
Some other CWC members and party officials close to Rao were,
however, all for the Congress to try to form the government. The
opinion in the party seems to have now crystallized in favor of
sitting in the opposition.

<HEADLINE> New Italian PM Promises Stability, Decentralization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 23 (Xinhua) -- New Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi promised today to work for political stability and conduct
reforms to turn the country into a decentralized state.
</P>
<P>
In his maiden speech to the upper house of parliament, Prodi
said he wanted stability after four years of political chaos and
urged the Opposition to cooperate in a cross-party drive to
rewrite the constitution and decentralize the state. The speech
will be followed by a confidence debate.
</P>
<P>
"The new Italy that will be born from these reforms will be an
Italy of autonomies," said Prodi, who came to power after his
center-left Olive Tree bloc won the elections last month. His
government is the first in 50 years to include the left.
</P>
<P>
Prodi underlined his opposition to "a desire for division" and
said he believed Italy's problems could be solved "only by
decentralization, subsidiarity and responsibility from all
citizens." He also pledged to boost development in Italy's south.
</P>
<P>
On the economy, he promised to resume talks on the lira's
return to the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a top
priority already listed by his predecessor Lamberto Dini. But he
ruled out tax cuts before 1999 and said economic growth would fail
to meet forecasts this year.
</P>
<P>
Most Opposition parties in the Senate, including the defeated
center-right Freedom Alliance and the separatist Northern League,
were indifferent to Prodi's policy address.
</P>
<P>
Francesco Peroni, chief League representative in the Senate,
described Prodi's hour-long speech as boring and threatened that
if no new proposals emerged during the debate, his party would
vote against the government in Friday's confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
Guido Maceratni, leader of the far-right National Alliance in
the Senate, said Prodi's speech would "send Italy to sleep." Even
Prodi's ally, the hardline Communist Refoundation party,
considered that speech old hat and called on him to take prompt
action.
</P>
<P>
But Northern League leader Umberto Bossi, who has set up a
self-styled parliament of the north with its own government and
wants to set up an independent state in the north, showed some
interest in Prodi's decentralization idea.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that Prodi had brought up the subject was
"partially positive" and there was "a glimmer of light."
</P>
<P>
Prodi's government needs to win twin votes of confidence in
both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, which will vote next
Friday, before being fully empowered. But analysts here say
parliamentary confirmation is a foregone conclusion because
Prodi's Olive Tree bloc enjoys a majority in the Senate and can
control the lower house with its ally, the lesser Communist
Refoundation party.

<HEADLINE> China, Bulgaria Issue Joint Communique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China and Bulgaria have issued a
joint communique today, calling for further cooperation on the
basis of equality, friendship and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that priority will be given to bilateral
cooperation in the fields of trade, economy, and science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will also encourage direct trade and economic
links between their localities and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The communique was issued at the end of the Bulgarian Premier
Jean Videnov's four-day trip to China.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in China, Videnov held talks with his Chinese
counterpart Li Peng, and met with Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, and
Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the leaders of the two countries are
satisfied with results of their talks and meetings and agreed that
Videnov's successful visit to China will produce a positive impact
to push forward bilateral relations, friendship and
mutually-benefiting cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Bulgaria believe that a stable and long-term
development of bilateral relations is not only beneficial to the
common wishes of their peoples and the fundamental interests of
the two countries, but also beneficial to the peace and
development in Asia and Europe, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the two countries reiterate that
the rights of each country's people to decide on their own destiny
and to choose the political system and road of economic growth at
their own will should be respected, and differences in such
regards should not become obstacles to the normal development of
state-to-state relations.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, China reiterates that it respects the
development road Bulgaria has chosen, and it follows with interest
the fundamental changes Bulgaria has undertaken in the political,
economic and social fields.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bulgaria reiterates its stand that there is only
China, and Taiwan is an integral part of China, the communique
said. Bulgaria will not change its position that the government of
the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government
of China and it will not establish any official links with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are willing to have closer cooperation and
more consultations on international issues and try their best to
safeguard regional and world peace, security and development, the
communique said.

HAVANA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Evgueni
Primakov today described his country's ties with Cuba as positive
and stressed that "we are on the verge of the apogee in our
relations."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, the Russian foreign minister said
relations between Russia and Cuba are based on the principle of
equal rights and non-interference in internal affairs.

Minister Roberto Robaina to visit Moscow after the presidential
elections in Russia in June.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Row Over U.S. Sanctions Features OECD Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A major row between the United States
and its trading partners over the U.S. practice of unilateral
sanctions unexpectedly dominated an annual ministerial meeting of
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, which ended here today, took on a
political tone after the European Union (EU) and Japan launched an
offensive against the U.S. trade position of unilaterally imposing
economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The meeting had been supposed to focus on examining the
economic situations of the Western industrialized nations,
discussing the 27-member bloc's future role in world economy and
coordinating the members' economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The EU and Japan urged the United States to drop its practice of
sanctions, calling it "anachronistic," and suggested that such
practice should be condemned in the final communique of the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The motion won support from Canada, Mexico and other
participants and a heated debate was unfolded after the United
States stubbornly rejected it.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed into law the Helms-Burton
bill to tighten its sanctions against Cuba after two small planes
of a U.S.-based anti-Cuba organization were shot down by the Cuban
Air Force, killing four Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
The law, which allows U.S. citizens to sue foreign companies
that invest in Cuba, threatens at least 1,000 European, Canadian
and Mexican companies, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives is also working on a law that
would slap sanctions on foreign companies that have economic and
trade links with Iran and Libya, two other bitter foes of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
U.S. repeated waving of sticks aroused strong resentment among
U.S. major trading partners, quite a few of whom have also suffered
from sanctions under the U.S. Special 301.
</P>
<P>
The United States is also threatening to punish China, using as
excuse China's so-called failure to protect U.S. intellectual
property rights.
</P>
<P>
These rude actions on the part of the United States in
international trade has given rise to worldwide anger.
</P>
<P>
Most of the participants in the meeting said U.S. sanctions
against Cuba and threat of sanctions against China are
"unacceptable" as they run counter to the rules of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Deputy President of the EU Commission Leon Brittan complained
that the U.S. trade stance jeopardized all the positive results of
international trade agreements and the United States is forcing its
domestic legislation on other countries.
</P>
<P>
Japanese delegates also lodged strong protests against the
United States.
</P>
<P>
In face of the concerted criticism, the United States argued that
international terrorism would be a better target for such censure.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been better if some of the energy spent on
criticizing our position was spent on criticizing international
terrorism," said White House chief economic advisor Joseph
Stiglitz, who is heading the U.S. delegation.
</P>
<P>
The final communique was a compromise between the two sides. It
included clauses like those calling for resisting "protectionist
pressure" and avoiding "taking trade and investment measures that
would be in contradiction with (WTO) rules and OECD codes." But it
failed to directly condemn the U.S. position on trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
France will again raise the question of U.S unilateral sanction
measures at a WTO meeting, said Yves Calland, minister-delegate to
the Ministry of Economy and Finance in charge of foreign trade
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The wrangle at the OECD meeting shows that the U.S. position
toward international trade is increasingly unpopular, even among
its allies and major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
To settle all trade disputes through equal and peaceful talks
in line with WTO principles is the only choice for the United
States and the rest of the world as well.

<P>
HEFEI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)
"is still waiting for final approval from the relevant
authorities" to build a medium-sized experimental thermonuclear
facility in Hefei, the capital of Anhui province.
</P>
<P>
Wan Yuanxi, director of the Institute of Plasma Physics at the
CAS, said in a statement to Xinhua today that the program will

The program is known as the HT-7U Superconductive Tokamak
Controlled Thermonuclear Fusion Experimental Facility.
</P>
<P>
A report released yesterday saying that China and the United
States are to build an experimental thermonuclear facility is
inaccurate, Wan said.

BRASILIA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and Canada signed a nuclear
cooperation agreement today covering the exchange of nuclear
information, material and equipment, research and technical
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz
Felipe Lampreia and his Canadian counterpart Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia said at the signing ceremony that Brazil was committed
to the peaceful application of nuclear energy. Nuclear technology
should be used for the generation of electricity and the
production of radio isotopes for medicine, agriculture and
industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian minister, who arrived here this morning, said that
the accord demonstrated the high level of political and diplomatic
understanding between the two countries. It would also enable
Canadian companies to explore business opportunities in Brazil, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be in effect for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
In April, Brazil joined the Nuclear Providers Group, which
consists of 30 countries possessing nuclear technology. Members of
the group are pledged to nuclear non-proliferation and have to
abide by rules governing the sale of nuclear materials and
equipment.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela is happy about the World
Trade Organization's (WTO) decision to let its petroleum companies
export 120,000 barrels of reformulated gasoline every day, said
Venezuela's Foreign Trade Institute today.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the WTO made a decision in favor of the sales of
the reformulated gasoline from Venezuela and Brazil over the
U.S. discriminatory treatment.
</P>
<P>
In this way, Venezuela will maintain its lead in the premium
market of oil on the east coast of the United States, to be
reinforced by the service of overhauled Cardon Refinery.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. Clean Air Bill, North American gasoline
companies were allowed to reformulate gasoline on the basis of an
overall average of polluting components while Venezuela had to
comply with the minimum requisites of each pollutant.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Foreign Reserves Reaches 56.7 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's foreign reserves in
gold and dollars reached a record high of 56.7 billion U.S.
dollars in April.
</P>
<P>
The reserves represent at least a year's worth of imports, the
head of the Central Bank's Economic Department, Altamir Lopes,
said.
</P>
<P>
The reserves also act as a guarantee for the Real Plan by
showing that the government has enough dollars to offset any
future flight of capital, added Lopes. The Real Plan was launched
in 1994 to curb high inflation by devaluing the real, the
Brazilian currency.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank officials said the dollars being pumped into the
country are not predominantly speculative but are direct
investments and long-term loans which Brazilian companies have
received from abroad.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, direct investments climbed
to 1.2 billion dollars, surpassing the 758 million dollars in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Direct investments are projected to reach 7 billion dollars
this year.

CAIRO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- World number one Jansher Khan
defeated Ahmed Barada of Egypt to win the Al-Ahram International
squash tournament in straight games here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jansher beat the 19-year-old world junior champion 15-4, 15-11,
15-8 in just under 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The unseeded Barada, visibly weary after a triumphant week
during which he toppled world number two Rodney Eyles and sixth
seed Chris Walker of England, briefly challenged Jansher in the
second game.
</P>
<P>
He fought his way to 10-10 with a series of volleys and
attacking cross-court shots which occasionally wrong-footed the
champion.
</P>
<P>
But Jansher, unruffled by a few unforced errors, took five of
the next six points to clinch the game.

<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China's fledgling duty-free
industry is expected to maintain its growth in the Ninth Five-Year
Plan Period (1996-2000), China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The wider opening up of China and the rapid development of
international travel have created a larger and stable market for
the duty-free industry, Cheng Wendong, deputy director of China
National Tourism Administration, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years, some 255 million people will visit
China, giving a huge potential market for duty-free industry,
Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to earn 58 billion US dollars in foreign
exchange from tourism during 1996-2000, with sales of duty-free
products playing a more important role, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Cheng urged the domestic duty-free industry to strengthen
co-operation with its international counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Sixtyseven duty free suppliers from 15 countries and regions
including the United States, Britain, Italy and France will show
their commodities in a two-day exhibition which opens today in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China started duty-free business in 1979 and has set up 103
duty-free shops in 62 cities, selling more than 1,000 varieties of
goods including alcohol, cigarettes, perfume and clothes.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Business representatives from
Hawaii are aiming to draw investors to Hawaii State government
sponsored projects.
</P>
<P>
A 50-person business delegation from Hawaii was expected to
arrive on Tuesday in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, to
seek business co-operation with the region, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Guangdong Board of Investment and the Hawaii
Investment Promotion Council, the trade mission will present a
seminar to mark the start of new co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yuehua, director of the Department of American Affairs of
the Guangdong Board of Investment, said business co-operation with
the island was not yet active, but business activities with other
parts of the US have been quite successful.
</P>
<P>
The US investment in Guangdong is mainly from big cities on the
US mainland in areas of infrastructure and industry.
</P>
<P>
In the province, there are three US projects each with
investment of more than 100 million US dollars, eight with at
least 50 million US dollars and 114 with more than 10 million US
dollars.

About 50 of them are scattered in big cities across the US.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Intercepts US Wastes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Customs has intercepted 20
containers containing hazardous solid wastes, whose import here is
banned, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The 20 were among some 128 containers intercepted for
inspection for untimely or ineffective customs certificates.
</P>
<P>
Most of the containers of harmful wastes came from the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Authorities ordered the US companies that had shipped the waste
to China to return it to its place of origin, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
After a large amount of imported hazardous solid wastes was
found in Beijing, a joint investigation team was set up early this
month by the central government.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 640 tons of imported solid wastes were found early in
May in Pinggu County, in suburban Beijing. The process of sealing
the garbage into containers started on Tuesday afternoon, to
prevent the possibility of serious environmental pollution and
epidemic disease.
</P>
<P>
Empty containers were sent to Pinggu on Monday afternoon by the
China Oceanic Shipping Corp, which had shipped the garbage in.
</P>
<P>
The garbage had passed through Qingdao Customs in Shandong
Province last July and had arrived at a paper mill in Pinggu last
September.
</P>
<P>
Last week, while the joint investigation team was still probing
how the garbage passed customs in Qingdao, additional imported
hazardous solid wastes - more than 500 tons - were found in the
port. That shipment originated in New York.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Urges G-7 to Promote Partnership Spirit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto urged
the Group of Seven (G-7) countries to promote partnership between
the rich and poor countries to avoid exploitation, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The partnership spirit would prevent the developed countries
to exploit the poor countries," Soeharto said when talking to
French President Jaques Chirac's special envoy Bruno Burieux on
Wednesday at the Merdeka Palace.
</P>
<P>
The president said the partnership spirit enabled both
developing and less developed countries to grow strong and stand
on their own feet, according to State Secretary Moerdiono after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Partnership spirit does not mean that the developing countries
let themselves to be exploited by the rich. Instead, they use aids
to make themselves strong," the president noted.
</P>
<P>
In order to realize the partnership spirit, Soeharto reiterated
the importance of strengthening the South-South cooperation as
well as the North-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He told the French envoy that international partnerships could
be established through world organizations, including the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the French envoy's visit to Jakarta was
soliciting views from developing world which could be taken up in
the G-7 meeting, scheduled for June in Lyon, France, Moerdiono
said.
</P>
<P>
The views of Soeharto, Chirac's envoy said, are needed as the
president plays a key role in the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and
the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).
</P>
<P>
"France, which currently chaired the G-7, sees the upcoming G-7
meeting as crucial as it is expected to bring about positive
impacts on the globalization trend and on the developed and
developing countries," Moerdiono added.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 groups the United States, Germany, Japan, France,
Italy, Britain and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Forty Russian Soldiers Reported Killed in Predawn Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels reportedly killed 40
Russian soldiers and wounded 48 others in a predawn raid today
around the Chechen village of Bamut, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The rebels attacked Russian positions on the edge of the
village under the cover of darkness, resulting in an armed clash
which also left 120 separatists dead, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
It was the heaviest fighting in several weeks in Chechnya,
where rebels have been seeking independence from Russia.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 rebels holed up in Bamut, 40 kilometers southwest
of the Chechen capital, Grozny, according to a source in Russia's
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Despite several weeks of efforts by Russian troops to flush
them out, the rebels in Bamut were still holding a missile base,
designed by former Soviet engineers to withstand nuclear attacks.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here today, Chechen Prime Minister Nikolai
Koshman said the rebels would "hold out to the last" in what he
called their final stronghold.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin has promised to visit Chechnya before
the presidential election on June 16 to restart negotiations on
ending the 17-month-old conflict, in which more than 3,000 people
have been killed.
</P>
<P>
However, an unidentified Defense Ministry source said that only
the capture of Bamut would make the president's trip to the rebel
republic possible.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev announced that
Russian troops will start to pull out of the region on June 1,
saying it is unnecessary to station so many troops there as the
situation has changed.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Jiang's Tour: Milestone in Sino-African Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin's tour
of six African nations, which ended here today, marked a milestone
in developing the Sino-African relations.
</P>
<P>
The 38,000-kilometer tour, beginning on May 8, took him across
the entire African continent from Kenya, Ethiopia, Egypt, Mali,
Namibia to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Wherever he went, the Chinese president was accorded the
highest courtesy from his African counterparts and greeted by
thousands of people on the roadside.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-African relations have a long tradition, and Jiang's
current visit, the first by a Chinese president in recent years,
is to further enhance the friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
As Jiang put it midway on his tour, China is "ready to join
hands with Africa, the biggest developing continent in the world,
to share weal and woe and march into the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Jiang held meetings with heads of state of the six nations and
chiefs of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Arab
League, and reached broad agreement on bilateral relations and
major regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
In his speech on China's African policy in Addis Ababa, where
the OAU is based, Jiang raised five proposals and observations for
developing Sino-African relations in a new situation: to foster a
sincere friendship, to treat each other as equals, to seek common
development on the basis of mutual benefit, to increase
consultation and cooperation in the international affairs and to
look into the future and create a more splendid world. This was
highly appraised and broadly supported by the African nations.
</P>
<P>
China and the African countries also agree that they have a
long history of friendship which has been tested by time and the
changeable international situation.
</P>
<P>
It is easy for them to understand each other because of their
shared experience in the past and the common task of building a
thriving national economy and maintaining political stability.
</P>
<P>
Under the new situation, it is necessary as well as possible
for the two to become each other's "all-weather friend," to
increase exchanges in all fields and to march into the new century
together with more fruitful and concrete cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president and his African counterparts all believe
that the shock wave caused by the drastic changes in the post-Cold
War world has become, by and large, a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
In long term, Africa is now entering from the "liberation
century" into the "development century", taking the second
historical leap from national independence to economic take-off.
</P>
<P>
The two sides believe that peace and development in Africa and
the whole world are faced with both opportunities and
challenges. China and African nations should strengthen their
consultation and cooperation in international affairs, fight
against hegemonism and power politics and join efforts in
establishing a just and equitable new international political and
economic order.
</P>
<P>
In the two-week tour, Jiang and his hosts also discussed ways
of strengthening economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China's capital, technology and management skills and Africa's
rich resources and broad market can compliment each other,
offering huge potential and prospects for further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The leaders all agree to gradually expand cooperation between
their business communities while keeping governmental
contacts. They signed 23 documents on economic and technology
cooperation, encouraging joint ventures and cooperative-managing
enterprises to exert greater influence based on the principle of
mutual benefit and joint development.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang's visit successfully achieved the goal of
enhancing friendship, strengthening unity, furthering cooperation
and learning from the African people.
</P>
<P>
The "historical visit," as the African press puts it, is a
major event in Sino-African history. And it could be predicted
that it will open a new page in the Sino-African relations and
contribute greatly to world peace and development.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Defense Minister's Resignation Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula
Horn said today he had turned down the resignation of Defense
Minister Gyorgy Keleti and instead praised him for his "excellent
performance."
</P>
<P>
Horn made the remarks shortly after Keleti told reporters that
he had submitted his resignation to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Keleti quit after being sharply criticized by the opposition
for his failure to seek parliamentary approval for Hungary's
participation in war games in Poland earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Jeno Poda of the opposition Democratic Tribunal told
parliament Tuesday that the Defense Ministry sent eight Mig-29
fighters to take part in missile test-firing in Poland without a
prior go-ahead from parliament, in serious violation of the state
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Poda and all other opposition deputies said Keleti should bear
the blame and urged Horn to fire him. Horn admitted that a mistake
had been made and promised it would not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
But Keleti said he had been in the dark about the issue and put
the blame on Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces Sandor
Nemeth.
</P>
<P>
Nemeth in turn dismissed the charge, saying that the General
Staff had presented the military plan for 1996 to the Defense
Ministry in February and it was up to the Ministry to seek
parliament's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
A special committee has been set up to look into the issue.

<HEADLINE> Last Round of Bosnian Disarmament Talks Starts in Vienna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The last and most decisive round of
Bosnian disarmament talks started today in Austria's former
imperial palace, the Hofburg.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations, involving the Muslim-Croat Federation,
Bosnian Serbs, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
would be supervised by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
An OSCE spokesman told reporters that the organization hoped
the talks could finish before the June 6 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Those close to Norwegian General Vigleik Eide, who presides
over the talks, however, have reservations about the prospects of
the negotiations, saying it is up to all the representatives to
decide when the talks will end.
</P>
<P>
The arms control talks, starting in Vienna on January 5, aim
to reach a disarmament agreement which, as required by the Dayton
accord signed in November 1995, must be initialed on June 6 and
formally signed at the ministerial level on June 22.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton accord stipulates that if the disarmament talks
cannot produce an agreement before the deadline, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia will have to cut its troops by 25 percent
and the Bosnian government will be allowed to maintain a military
force twice the size of the Bosnian Serb forces.

projects in rural China while meeting with local officials in
charge of energy production.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years, another 300 rural counties will take
pioneering measures to promote the construction of such stations
with government and bank supports, he said, adding that favorable
electricity prices will also be worked out for this purpose.

<P>
-- Premier Li Peng has urged mayors of Chinese cities to do a
better job in city management. He said at a meeting of mayors that
the scope of cities should be put under control to make management
easier. Top priority should be given to the development of public
transportation as traffic jam is a big problem in cities, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the construction of luxury buildings must be
kept under control, and more residential buildings should be built.

years to come.
</P>
<P>
-- A front-page roundup hailed President Jiang Zemin's recent
visit to six African nations as "a milestone of developing
trans-century Sino-African relations." Jiang's visit is conducive
to the strengthening of solidarity and cooperation between China
and the developing countries, especially the African states.

amendment to the Statistics Law has stipulated severe punishment
for those who falsify statistics, Shao Zongming, deputy
director-general of the State Statistics Bureau was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
-- China's establishment of foundations for funding scientific

<HEADLINE> Juventus Win European Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Juventus won the European Champions
Cup here Wednesday night when they beat holders Ajax Amsterdam
4-2 in a penalty shoot-out after the extra time wound up at
one-all.
</P>
<P>
Fabrizio Ravanelli gave Juventus a 13th minute lead, sweeping
the ball into an open net, but Ajax's Finnish striker Jari
Litmanen equalised four minutes later.
</P>
<P>
After a goalless second-half and extra-time, the final went to
penalties, with Ajax midfielder Edgar Davids missing the first of
the night and teammate Sonny Silooy later botching another.
</P>
<P>
Juventus converted all of their efforts and the stadium erupted
when substitute Vladimir Jugovic banged in their fourth to clinch
the trophy for the second time in the club's history.
</P>
<P>
The last European Cup final in Rome also went to penalties with
Liverpool beating AS Roma 4-2 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Juventus had the better chances in an open, finely-balanced
match, which fully lived up to its expectations -- a clash
between the passion and commitment of the Italians and the class
of the holders.
</P>
<P>
However, that class was too often stifled by underdogs
Juventus, who took the match to their opponents right from the
start and harried them for the entire 120 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Monsanto to Help China Develop Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The American company that helped
rid China's famous Forbidden City of unsightly weeds, is planning
a major investment drive in the country.
</P>
<P>
Monsanto, the third largest chemical company in the United
States, is to help China to develop agriculture, promising it will
help create a healthy environment.
</P>
<P>
Robert Shapiro, chairman of the company, made the announcement
as he made his first visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said that with business in agricultural,
pharmaceutical, food, ingredient and chemical products, Monsanto,
a global corporation, will focus its investment in China in
agriculture, providing China with high-quality fertilizers and
pesticides as well as bio-chemical technologies.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to rapid growth of China's economy, Monsanto views an
optimistic future for its business expansion in China, said
Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
Monsanto is considering more than 20 projects in China,
including joint ventures, partnerships and potential investments
or acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
In a co-operative project with Chinese universities and
colleges Monsanto will commit 200,000 US dollars over a five-year
period to fund Monsanto Scholarships and Funds in the China
Agricultural University in Beijing and Fudan University in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Famous for its "Roundup" brand herbicide, Monsanto intends to
set up 10 joint ventures in China by the end of the century,
including the current three, and to lift its annual sales in China
to 500 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> 100,000 Residents of Chengdu Relocated for River Cleaning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Liu Guoqin, a retired construction
worker in the capital of Sichuan Province, is pleased with his new
house, which he got thanks to a 330 million US dollar
environmental protection project, saying "I never dreamt of living
in such a good house."
</P>
<P>
Liu and 100,000 other residents from 30,000 families in Chengdu
were moved from the downtown area into newer, more spacious
housing as part of a project to clean up the seriously polluted
Funan River around the city.
</P>
<P>
The relocated residents were given the same amount of housing
and were able to buy an additional 25 square meters for each
family at a subsidized price of 200 yuan (about 24 US dollars) per
square meter.
</P>
<P>
Most of the old houses in downtown Chengdu were 200 years old,
and were low-lying, damp, and rundown, and near the Funan
River. The silted-up river, a tributary of the Yangtze, is only
capable of withstanding the kind of flooding that occurs every
decade.
</P>
<P>
The 100,000 residents now live in about 20 new residential
zones in suburban areas. At the same time, 4,000 enterprises and
institutes along the river, which were mostly responsible for the
daily discharge of 600,000 cu.m. industrial waste and sewage, were
also resettled.
</P>
<P>
The city government has allocated 2.7 billion yuan (3.3 billion
US dollars) for the project, a figure equivalent to all the
government's revenues for 1994.
</P>
<P>
The project, designed to clean 505 sq km of polluted river and
to promote local economic development, was started in late 1994,
and is expected to be completed by next year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Rongxuan, a city official, said that its goal is curbing
pollution and ecological degradation in Chengdu, but even more
importantly, to improve Chengdu's investment conditions, since
1,957 joint ventures have been set up over the past five years,
with a total investment of more than 2 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jihai, who is in charge of the project, said that 80
percent of the project is expected to be finished by the end of
the year, including environmental protection, flood-control,
greenery, underground pipelines, and resettlement.
</P>
<P>
The flood-control project involves 18 km of embankments and
consolidation of a 23-km dyke system, and dredging 16 km of the
river, which will be widened 40 to 120 meters to increase the
river's flood-control capacity to the worst possible flood every
200 years.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Japan and Britain say that an urban construction
project involving the relocation of 100,000 residents from
downtown areas is unprecedented even in developed countries.

<HEADLINE> Tourism in Panama Grows 6.4 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in Panama were
up 6.4 percent in the first quarter of this year over the same
period last year in what the government has targeted as a growth
industry.
</P>
<P>
A total of 118,797 foreigners visited Panama in the first three
months of 1996, thanks to a government campaign to attract more
tourists, director of the Panamanian Tourism Institute Pedro
Campagnani said today.
</P>
<P>
Panama is confident that tourism - called here the "industry
without smokestacks" - will become one of its most important
sources of revenue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism generated about 310 million U.S.dollars last year and
is expected to earn twice as much this year as Panama benefits
from a recent pledge by Central American presidents to turn the
region into an integrated tourist destination, added Campagnani.
</P>
<P>
Last year Central American countries received more than 2
million tourists who brought in at least 1.3 billion dollars in
revenue.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A comeback of Argentine soccer star
Diego Armando Maradona to the Italian soccer league was reported
as possible by Perugia president Luciano Gaucci on Wednesday, a
press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
``If he can solve his tax problems with Italian authorities,
Maradona is ready to return to Italy and play with Perugia,'' said
Gaucci, whose B-league team is in the running from promotion to the
first division.
</P>
<P>
Gaucci, an industrialist, made his disclosure at Rome's Olympic
stadium, before kickoff of the Juventus-Ajax Champions Cup final.
</P>
<P>
``If Perugia is promoted and tax problems are solved, there are
good chances to see Maradona wearing the white-and-red jersey
(Perugia colors),'' Gaucci said.
</P>
<P>
Maradona, one of the world's most popular and highest paid
soccer players, left Italy in 1991 - when playing with
first-division Napoli - after receiving a 15-month international
suspension for cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
He swore at the time he would never return to Italy again.
</P>
<P>
He was suspended again during the 1994 World Cup in the United
States when he was captain of the Argentine national team.
</P>
<P>
Maradona currently plays with Boca Juniors. His contract with
Boca expires at the end of the current Argentine soccer season.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- David Whitaker, coach of Britain
men's hockey team, walked out on Wednesday -- just two months
before he was due to lead the team in the quest for a second
Olympic gold medal in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Whitaker, who masterminded Britain's route to gold in Seoul
eight years ago, blamed increasing business commitments and also
claimed it was not a sudden decision.
</P>
<P>
"I discussed my withdrawal after the Olympic qualifier in
January," said the 47-year-old Whitaker in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
Richard Dodds, chairman of the Britain Men's Hockey Committee,
said: "Obviously we regret it, but we believe his decision has
been made in the best interests of the team in the build-up to
Atlanta."
</P>
<P>
Whitaker is known to have been upset by media attention
surrounding his private life, although Dodds stressed: "That is
nothing to do with me or my committee. As far as I am concerned,
it did not affect his role as coach."
</P>
<P>
He led the British team to a bronze medal at the Los Angeles
Olympics in 1984, coached England to a World Cup silver two years
later before striking gold in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Whitaker then resigned to follow a new career in management
consultancy, although he returned to hockey in 1993. Since then
he has found it difficult to recreate his earlier success, with
England finishing only sixth in the 1994 World Cup.

<HEADLINE> Germany Beaten by Spain in World Team Cup Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Germany lost its second straight
defeat when it was beaten by Spain in the World Team Cup tennis
tournament in Dusseldorf, Germany, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker withdrew from his scheduled clash with Sergi
Bruguera and will miss the French Open beginning in Paris next
week after suffering a thigh muscle injury on Monday while playing
Marc Rosset.
</P>
<P>
Becker, ranked 5th in the world, will now undergo therapy and
receive a series of injections over the next 10 to 14 days in an
effort to get fit for the grass court season that begins in less
than three weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
In the Spain-Germany contest, Alberto Costa was far too
consistent for the adventurous but erratic Carl-Uwe Steeb and
swept to a 6-0, 6-3 victory in just over an hour.
</P>
<P>
David Prinosil gave the struggling Bruguera a fright by taking
the opening set, but was denied his first clay court victory of
the year as the Spaniard bounced back to win 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Even so, it was a real struggle for Bruguera, who has slipped
to 23 in the world, his lowest ranking for four years.
</P>
<P>
Like Germany, defending champions Sweden lost their first two
matches, falling to Switzerland on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Marc Rosset, who has struggled to find any consistency this
year after breaking his hand in January, used his big serve to
gain a confidence-boosting 6-1, 2-6, 6-3 win over 9th-ranked
Thomas Enqvist.
</P>
<P>
Jakob Hlasek found a single break of serve at 3-2 in the final
set was enough to earn him a 2-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory over Magnus
Larsson, who has still to return to form after a broken foot gave
him an unwanted four-month vacation last year.
</P>
<P>
In matches held over from Tuesday because of rain, the
Netherlands completed a 2-1 victory over Russia by winning the
deciding doubles when Paul Haarhuis and Jan Siemerink overcame
Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Alexander Volkov 6-4, 4-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic completed a 3-0 whitewash over the United
States as Petr Korda and Daniel Vacek edged past Richey Reneberg
and Jonathan Stark 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 7-6 (7/5).
</P>
<P>
Eight teams, split into two groups, each play three rounds here
with the winners of each group contesting Sunday's final.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The improving investment environment
in the Yantai Economic and Technology Development Zone in east
China's Shandong province has drawn the interest of foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1985, the zone has spent 6.6 billion yuan on fixed
assets, and concluded 620 contracts on foreign investments.
Included were 127 foreign-funded projects that have gone into
production.
</P>
<P>
According to Yan Yuantian, chairman of the zone's
administrative committee, the zone has built infrastructural
facilities and public utilities within a ten-square-kilometer area.
</P>
<P>
It also has created a soft investment environment in line with
the international convention.
</P>
<P>
Yan noted that the zone has simplified formality by opening a
"special window", through which foreign business people can
complete all necessary procedures.
</P>
<P>
In addition senior government officials regularly visit the
zone to handle official business, and consult opinions from
foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To improve the service to foreign-funded enterprises, the zone
has separated the administrative functions of enterprises from
those of government by way of auction or transforming into
shareholding companies.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many foreign-funded enterprises at the zone have
expanded their production scales, and increased their investment.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The British and Irish governments
failed here today to reach agreement on procedures for arms
decommissioning by rival paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Irish Foreign
Minister Dick Spring held talks for nearly five hours on this
issue. Both of them said they were making progress, but there were
a number of issues still to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed tonight that the two governments agreed that
arms decommissioning had to be addressed and that weapons should
be handed over at all-party talks process scheduled for June 10.
</P>
<P>
The issue of arms decommissioning has become pressing, as
elections in Northern Ireland and all-party talks are approaching.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the biggest Protestant party
In Ulster with nine seats in the House of Commons, threatened
Tuesday to vote against the British government if Prime Minister
John Major made more concessions to the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) and its political wing Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
Mayhew and Spring reiterated that only an unequivocal
cease-fire by the IRA could earn Sinn Fein a seat at the coming
all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
They vowed that "inclusive" all-party talks should start on
June 10.

NEW YORK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on the New York Stock

The Dow Jones industrial average gained 41.74 at 5,778.00 at

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a slim margin, with
volume being moderately high but slightly below Tuesday's level.

The yielding of the 30-year Treasury bond ended up at 6.81
percent.
</P>
<P>
Broad indexes gained as well, with the NYSE composite up 2.14

The American Stock Exchange's market value index up 2.72 at
614.95, working toward its fifth straight record high. The Nasdaq
composite was up 2.31 at 1,246.73.
</P>
<P>
Stocks paused Tuesday as strong consumer spending rekindled
inflation fears in the bond market, sending interest rates higher.
Trading was restrained before and after a meeting by the Federal
Reserve's policy makers, who, as expected, left the central bank's
short-term lending rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
After cutting short-term rates three times since last July to
stimulate economic growth, the committee decided in March to hold
rates steady as signs of a moderately rebounding economy and
higher inflation emerged.

ensuring the full freedom of movement for the Bosnian citizens and
the economic reconstruction of the war-torn areas, Tanjug news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The freedom of movement in Bosnia is hardly realized until now
although it is vital to the success of the upcoming elections.
Local civilians, with ethnic hatred still in their heart, have
refused to allow other nationals to enter their land either for
brief visit or for settle-down.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian president and his U.S. guests also discussed
bilateral relations and agreed that regular political dialogues
between Belgrade and Washington extend an undoubted contribution
to the improvement of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed that a full normalization of diplomatic
relations between Yugoslavia and the United States would help
strengthen peace and stability in the region, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Much Work To Be Done For Growth In Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A real economic take-off is
possible in southern Africa, but much work needs to be done
before this happens, businessmen said today at the opening of the
1996 Southern African Economic Summit in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit, organized jointly by the World Economic
Forum of Geneva and the Southern African Development Community
(SADC), is being attended by political leaders from the SADC and
about 400 senior businessmen from around the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the summit, South Africa's Transnet managing
director Anton Moolman said the question as to whether
infrastructure will prove to be a springboard or a barrier to the
development in southern Africa is in the region's hands.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Delta Corporation managing director Patrick Rooney
said southern Africa has the necessary infrastructure to allow
for a real business take-off, more so in some areas than others.
</P>
<P>
He argued that policies present more of a barrier to
investment, and the region's policy formulation is not keeping
pace with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Standard Bank investment chairman Conrad
Strauss emphasized that sustained economic growth is
skills-based, and that with the globalization of world markets
businesses will use labour where it is cheapest.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, political leaders also stressed that regional
cooperation is essential for the SADC to become prosperous.
</P>
<P>
SADC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> National Park Service Planning For Pennsylvania Avenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A year after a two-block section
of Pennsylvania Avenue was closed out of security concern for the
White House, the National Park Service proposed on Wednesday that
it be turned into a pedestrian mall.
</P>
<P>
National Park Service Director Roger Kennedy called the plan
"our best effort."
</P>
<P>
The plan would replace concrete barriers with less-obtrusive
security barricades around the perimeter of the stretch of
boulevard in front of the White House.
</P>
<P>
The plan, still awaiting approval, is the result of more than
600 design suggestions proposed since the Park Service began
working on the issue last October.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the two blocks closed on
May 20, last year, on the recommendation of the Secret Service,
less than six weeks after the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal
building.
</P>
<P>
Some people have argued that the street should be reopened and
there have been complaints about traffic tie-ups.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Official: More Than 10,000 Persons Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- An international Red Cross
official said today more than 10,000 persons are missing in Bosnia
due to the bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
Head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
mission in Bosnia Pierre Kraehenbiell said in Banja Luka, the Serb
industrial city in northwestern Bosnia, that the ICRC mission in
Bosnia had so far processed and forwarded to the inter-ethnic
working group for missing persons about 4,000 requests for search
of missing persons, while the others were being worked on, Tanjug
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
In order to speed up the search, the ICRC will start this week
to show on television lists with the names of the registered
missing persons, and will begin to distribute leaflets of the same
content in two weeks, the IFCR official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Kraehenbiell also said the working group -- which includes
three representatives from each of the three ethnic parties in
Bosnia and international observer Republika Srpska -- would also
be allowed to attend the session, he said.

<HEADLINE> China on Formulation of Strategies for Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese diplomat said on
Wednesday that five points should be observed in formulating the
United Nations' integrated development strategies for poverty
eradication.
</P>
<P>
The remarks was made at an eight-day special session of the
United Nations Commission for Social Development. The session was
called on May 21 to elaborate the commission's multi-year
program of activity to the year 2000 on the follow-up to the
1995 World Summit for Social Development.
</P>
<P>
Meng Xianying, who is the alternate representative of Chinese
Delegation at the special session, said the five points are as
followed:
</P>
<P>
-- First, to eradicate poverty is a requirement for the
protection of people's right to existence.
</P>
<P>
"Only when people manage to exist, can there be any possibility
for development," she said. "All other rights should be premised
on the right to survival."
</P>
<P>
-- Second, to raise people's level of education is a basic
prerequisite for poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
-- Third, poverty eradication requires that developed countries
make more contributions and that international cooperation be
vigorously carried out.
</P>
<P>
-- Fourth, governments are needed for organizing anti-poverty
activities as well as rendering assistance.
</P>
<P>
--fifth, to mobilize resources of the whole society in the
efforts to eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Eradication of poverty is an important agenda of the United
Nations. The U.N. General Assembly has proclaimed 1996 as the
International Year for the Eradication of Poverty and designated
1997-2006 as the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication
of Poverty.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Propose Campaign Funding Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- House Democrats Wednesday
introduced a campaign finance reform bill which would limit
congressional candidates' spendings to 600,000 dollars and
restrict large contributions from individuals and political action
committees (PACs).
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Representative Sam Farr, a Democrat of California,
the bill would set up a voluntary system to limit spending and
fund-raising by candidates.
</P>
<P>
The bill would limit spending in a two-year cycle to 600,000
dollars, limit contributions to 8,000 dollars per PAC, limit
contributions from large contributors to 200,000 dollars and limit
a candidate to providing 50,000 dollars of his or her own money.
</P>
<P>
The bill would ban so-called "soft money" donated to state
political parties for certain expenses. The bill also would limit
independent expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Farr said his bill was needed because campaign spending has
exploded, going from about 38 million dollars in 1974 to 231
million dollars in the 1994 campaign.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Republicans are pushing a campaign finance reform
bill that would ban PACs, which corporate, labor and other
interests use to funnel money to politicians.
