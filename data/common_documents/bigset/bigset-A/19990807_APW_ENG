<HEADLINE> Man Allegedly Helped Wife's Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A 75-year-old man has been charged with  
manslaughter for allegedly hanging a noose from a ceiling beam and 
leaving his ailing wife alone to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Florio, 75, pleaded innocent Friday and was ordered held  
on $10,000 bail, said Sherry Hunter, spokeswoman for the Queens 
district attorney. If convicted, he could face up to 15 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a very loving couple and now the family is dealing  
with a tragedy of immense proportion,'' said Florio's lawyer, John 
Halton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Florio, 70, was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and heart  
problems earlier this year. Her husband told police that she had 
repeatedly asked for his help in committing suicide as her health 
deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, Florio allegedly drilled a hole through a  
ceiling beam in their home. Investigators said he then ran the rope 
through it and left a slipknot noose dangling. He left the 
apartment Thursday morning, and returned that afternoon to find his 
wife dead, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Halton would not comment on the circumstances of Mrs. Florio's  
death.

<HEADLINE> Jets Stars Respond To Parcells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Coach Bill Parcells vented -- and the New  
York Jets responded. 
</P>
<P>
	One day after being criticized by Parcells for lackluster play  
early in training camp, key members of the Jets' explosive offense 
showcased tremendous plays Saturday in the club's first intrasquad 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	In limited action, quarterback Vinny Testaverde threw for 145  
yards, including sensational touchdown throws of 19 yards to a 
diving Wayne Chrebet and 31 yards to Keyshawn Johnson, who fought 
off a physical defense to snare the pass with only his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Those three players had been part of Parcells' harsh attention  
on Friday, when he wondered aloud when the headliners on his 
``Superstar Central'' offense were going to make an impact. 
Testaverde finished 8-for-16 passing, with no interceptions, with 
Johnson catching three passes for 100 yards and Chrebet two for 33. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things like that don't bother me,'' Johnson said of Parcells'  
criticism. ``It goes in one ear and out the other, that superstar 
stuff. He couldn't have been talking about me. I just come in and 
try to help the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kicker John Hall, who missed a 53-yard field goal attempt,  
connected from 23, 22 and 48 yards. Second-year player Brian Musso, 
fighting for the fourth receiver spot, had four catches for 69 
yards. On defense, linebackers J.J. Syvrud, Olrick Johnson and 
Bryan Cox, along with defensive end Anthony Pleasant, registered 
sacks and safety Victor Green an interception. 
</P>
<P>
	The 90-minute scrimmage, held before approximately 1,000 fans,  
included 91 plays and featured most of the 80-man roster. Included 
in the action was wide receiver Dwight Stone, signed by the team 
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some good and some bad,'' Parcells said.  
</P>
<P>
	Parcells supervised the scrimmage only hours before his former  
star linebacker, Lawrence Taylor, was inducted into the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame at Canton, Ohio. The coach, who was not asked 
to introduce Taylor, elected not to attend the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I can see it,'' said Parcells, who expressed  
irritation over some commentaries criticizing his decision to stay 
away from Canton. ``I'm very proud of him. I heard someone on the 
radio today refer to Parcells' ego and how because he didn't get to 
induct (Taylor) that he didn't go. There could be nothing further 
from the truth.''

<HEADLINE> Jones Ties Season's Best in 100M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Marion Jones tied her fastest time of the year and  
world record holder Maurice Greene cruised to victory on Saturday 
at Crystal Palace in a tune-up for this month's World Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene's 9.97 seconds at the British Grand Prix was well short  
of the 9.79 he ran in Athens two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a bit tired now because I have done a lot of racing  
recently,'' Greene said. ``I didn't feel any pressure here today 
and I just had to come out and have fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the time proves I am in great shape and I am ready for  
Seville,'' said Greene after he finished clear of Canada's Bruny 
Surin (10.02) and Britain's Dwain Chambers (10.04) with Olympic 
champion Donovan Bailey, still on his way back from long-term 
injury, last in a season's best 10.36. 
</P>
<P>
	The consolation for Greene was that he became the first sprinter  
to run inside 10 seconds on a British track. Not even Linford 
Christie, Britain's former Olympic champion currently at the center 
of drugs allegations, achieved that. 
</P>
<P>
	The American returned to anchor a 4x100 relay team to victory in  
38.02 seconds. The other three runners were Jon Drummond, Ato 
Boldon and Curtis Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 100, Jones matched 10.80 she clocked last month  
at Lausanne.	   She finished almost three meters clear of world 200-meter 
champion Zhanna Pintusevich of Ukraine, who clocked 10.98 with 
another American, Inger Miller, third in 11.13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so far ahead of the rest of the world that everyone is  
just judging me by my times,'' said Jones, the only runner other 
than the late Florence Griffith Joyner to run inside 10.73. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj failed in his bid to break the  
world mile record he set a month ago in Rome and Haile Gebrselassie 
was just over three seconds outside the world two-mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj eclipsed former world record holders Sebastian Coe,  
Steve Ovett and Steve Cram in running the fastest mile on a British 
track, 3:47.10. Kenya's Laban Rotich finished a distant second in 
3:50.79. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy with the time bearing in mind the (hemarroids)  
problems I had,'' said El Guerrouj, who had suffered the illness 
since his world record run. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie, who has set 15 world records, was left to run the  
last mile of the two-mile race on his own after the pacemakers 
dropped out with the rest of the field at least 50 meters behind. 
</P>
<P>
	With no one to attack him, the Ethiopian made a big late attempt  
to break the record of 7:58.61 owned by his great rival Daniel 
Komen of Kenya but he crossed the line in 8:01.72 with no one else 
within 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenyans finished second and third, Paul Bitok clocking 8:16.44  
and James Kosgei 8:16.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco's Zahra Ouaziz ran the fastest women's 5,000 meters in  
the world this year with a 14:42.03. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie was expected to be at the meet to coach his sprinters  
but decided not to attend because he was concerned that the 
publicity surrounding his suspension would be a distraction for the 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old 1992 Olympic 100m champion, who is retired but  
runs for fun, was suspended after failing a drugs test at Dortmund 
in February. A test detected the presence of metabolites of the 
banned steroid nandrolone and news reports on Saturday said the 
levels were 100 times the permitted amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie has declared his innocence saying the tests were flawed  
and UK Athletics, which is responsible for the sport in Britain, 
has launched a campaign for more accurate tests for nandrolone.

	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- New York Yankees slugger Darryl Strawberry  
continued his comeback with a pair of singles for Triple-A Columbus 
on Friday night in an 11-4 loss against Indianapolis. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Games Give Winnipeg a Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Locals here joke about mosquitoes so  
large they can carry off small children and winter temperatures so 
frigid that it is the one way they always beat the rest of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Winnipeg's image -- or lack of one -- is almost matter of pride.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think most people don't know about us,'' says Mayor Glen  
Murray. ``We're north of Minneapolis, so people think we're an 
iceberg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it's not a surprise that the city thought it would be great  
to put on a big international sporting event. Trouble is, they 
picked the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking on 5,000 athletes, 41 sports and almost as many  
countries, this tortilla-flat town created a folksy regional 
Olympics that combined grand hopes with low expectations in a 
strategy that foreshadows the financial realities of sporting 
events to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Though still wildly popular in Latin America, Winnipeg found  
that there are consequences to the fact the games themselves aren't 
what they once were. 
</P>
<P>
	When Winnipeg played host to the 1967 Pan American Games, it was  
one of the largest multisport events outside of the Olympics, a 
launching pad for future greats such as sprinter John Carlos and 
swimmer Mark Spitz. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, with many individual federations holding their own  
championships, elite athletes have other things to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball's Dream Team was busy in Puerto Rico, for example,  
only four days before the Pan Ams opened. NBA stars like Tim 
Duncan, Steve Smith and Jason Kidd qualified for Sydney in 2000. A 
cobbled bunch of CBA players went to Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first two weeks of the games, which end Sunday, only one  
world record was set -- Cuban weightlifter Hidalberto Aranda hoisted 
453 pounds in the 77-kilogram clean-and-jerk. 
</P>
<P>
	Games officials realized early on that they would lack star  
power, signing Olympic 100-meter gold medalist Donovan Bailey to an 
appearance contract on home soil that reportedly paid $132,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey -- who skipped the 100 here -- helped some, but the lack of  
top athletes showed in the stands, which were usually empty unless 
Canada was on the field. Games officials were reduced to taking out 
full-page ads to sell tickets for the closing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest news out of the games was negative -- a handful of  
high-profile drug failures, including world high-jump record holder 
Javier Sotomayor flunking a test for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of trouble isn't Winnipeg's fault, sports marketers said.  
With the real Olympics now occurring every two years and the 
Goodwill Games, the Commonwealth Games and dozens of other 
international competitions saturating on cable in between, the Pan 
Ams found it impossible to attract attention, much less excitement, 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Scandals in the Olympic movement have by association tarnished  
the reputation of its lesser cousins in the public imagination, 
said Jed Pearsall of Performance Research, a Newport, R.I., 
marketing firm that evaluates events for corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're finding that passion is less, less and less for  
international sporting events,'' he said. As for the Pan Ams, 
Pearsall was even more blunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletes are most interested in the best event for their  
single category and the Pan Am Games doesn't do that for any 
category,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unsure of what to expect, Pan Am officials budgeted for an  
almost doomsday scenario and worked hard to make up in warmth what 
the event lacked in glitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Limousines for VIPs were out; minivans were in. Superstar  
entertainers skipped the opening ceremony and were replaced by 
audience participation. Some 20,000 volunteers took on the grunt 
work, picking up trash and handing out results. 
</P>
<P>
	The games had a budget of $93.1 million, a figure so low that  
Pan Am press secretary Brian Koshul joked it probably wouldn't even 
buy the liniment needed for sore muscles in Salt Lake City, the 
2002 Winter Olympic site with a budget of $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The specter of the $1 billion debt Montreal incurred in playing  
host to the 1976 Olympics also pushed organizers to make fiscal 
restraint a top priority, planning for spectator projections so low 
they almost couldn't fail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a realization that there isn't a bottomless  
pot of money,'' said Bob McMahon, the chief operating officer for 
the Pan American Games Society Inc. ``I think it's better to 
deliver what you promise than to have your expectations so high 
that you can't deliver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon said he was ``absolutely confident we're going to break  
even.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This trading center nicknamed the ``Chicago of the North'' knows  
something about dashed expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a bustling industrial center that served as the gateway for  
much of the settlement of western Canada, Winnipeg's economy 
stagnated in the 1970s, losing business to high taxes and talent to 
the booming oil towns like Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the eighth-largest city in Canada, economists say Winnipeg  
cashed in on the North American Free Trade Agreement, earning 
growth in the less-than-glamorous worlds of bus and furniture 
manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking to expand trade, the Pan Am Games offered an ideal way  
for this city to raise its profile in Latin American markets, no 
matter what happened in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	It paid off. Brazil, one of Latin America's largest economies,  
sent 453 athletes and accredited 50 reporters to cover the games. 
Once the country started racking up the golds, even that wasn't 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest Brazilian television network, O Globo, has broken in  
to regular programing with live broadcasts and featured coverage 
every night. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether that helps the Winnipeg economy in the end is hard to  
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it comes down to is what people carry in their heads and  
their heart,'' McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
	One city that took close account of Winnipeg's efforts was Santo  
Domingo, site of the next Pan American Games in 2003. Delegation 
leader Luis Mejia Oviedo said he was busy lobbying the Pan American 
Sports Organization and individual federations to make certain the 
top talent appears. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have good athletes,'' he said, ``television will pay  
attention.''

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Reform Up in Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaign finance reform, a cause as durable as  
its unyielding foes, is coming up again this fall, with advocates 
still trying to find a path past the perennial Senate Republican 
filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders agreed to action on bills they oppose, after  
the sponsors threatened to force the issue, clogging other business 
on the crowded agenda just before Congress quit for summer 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	So the House will consider an assortment of four campaign bills  
next month, among them one that would deal with the chief target of 
reformers by banning the unlimited contributions that now can flow 
into political parties -- unrestricted political money that has 
become a route around the limits that cover donations to 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the bill that House passed 252 to 179 in 1998, overriding  
the opposition of GOP leaders, to send it to its regular filibuster 
fate in the Senate. It never came to a direct vote there, but a 
majority did side with the reformers on a preliminary step. Their 
problem, now as then, is that a majority won't do. 
</P>
<P>
	They need 60 votes -- or three-fifths of the Senate -- to stop the  
talk and force action. Opponents, led by Sen. Mitch McConnell, 
R-Ky., say they've got the votes to block the bill again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	It has become an annual exercise, to the same stalemate, leaving  
the loopholed, 25-year-old campaign finance law alone. It limits 
contributions to candidates, but the Supreme Court ruled that their 
spending can't be limited because that would infringe on freedom of 
speech. The contribution limits are $1,000 for individuals, $5,000 
for political action committees and $25,000 to a national political 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	``But those limits are easily evaded by the unlimited  
contributions of soft money,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. ``We 
have, in effect, no limits today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, chief Republican sponsor of the  
bill that would ban those unrestricted donations, agreed to the 
deal that promises the measure will come up by Oct. 12 for at least 
three days of debate. McCain, a GOP presidential candidate, had 
threatened to snarl Senate action this month to get something done 
on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid that, Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, offered the  
agreement for action in the fall, but with a price on it. The 
sponsors get one chance to push the bill past the filibuster to a 
vote. Lott, R-Miss., promised them ample time for debate and action 
on amendments, after which the Senate is to vote on ending the 
filibuster. Their part of the deal is that unless they win the 60 
votes to do it, they won't try to raise the issue again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., McCain's cosponsor, said that  
with ``real amendments, real debate and a real discussion,'' he 
thinks the reformers can round up 60 votes, maybe 70. 
</P>
<P>
	They've never come close to those numbers, not even when the  
campaign reform issue was dramatized and driven by Democratic 
fundraising abuses and Republican investigations of illicit foreign 
donations in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the reformers have narrowed their aims, to the soft  
money ban, stronger disclosure requirements, and regulation of what 
are called issue ads. Those are campaign commercials paid for by 
interest groups which avoid the contribution limits because they do 
not directly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate. They 
do so without saying so. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier campaign bills sought to curb political action  
committees, and to have the government provide incentives to 
candidates who would agree to limit their campaign spending. 
</P>
<P>
	That hasn't placated opponents. ``The American people do not  
need government speech police dictating what, where, when and how 
they can speak about issues,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, the GOP whip. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert said campaign legislation will be  
considered the week of Sept. 13; his timetable held after a 
petition drive by the reformers stalled short of the majority it 
would have taken to force earlier action.

<HEADLINE> President Lauds Author Willie Morris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Author Willie Morris was ``the classic  
Southerner'' who helped outward-looking young people recognize they 
could love the South ``and want to change it at the same time,'' 
President Clinton writes in Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippian Morris died Monday of a heart attack at age 64. He  
wrote more than a dozen books during a wide-ranging career as 
journalist, editor and novelist. At 33, he became the youngest 
editor ever of Harper's Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	In a two-paragraph essay that Time released Saturday, Clinton  
wrote that he met Morris in New York in 1968, the year after he 
took over at Harper's. Clinton, just selected for a Rhodes 
scholarship, had written former Rhodes scholar Morris asking for a 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``To my surprise, he agreed to see me. He was wonderfully wry  
and funny -- the classic Southerner,'' Clinton wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, for most of my generation of Southerners who went  
North, the book that stuck in their minds was (Thomas Wolfe's) `You 
Can't Go Home Again.' Willie's `North Toward Home' was a 
beautifully written evocative portrait of one person's love for the 
South who had profound regret over the racial situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wrote that Morris' perspective ``helped a lot of people  
like me who wanted to see the world and do well up North but also 
come home and live in the South. He showed us how we could love a 
place and want to change it at the same time. ... He showed us we 
could go home.''

	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Switzerland's sober financial capital  
throbbed to the beat of techno music Saturday as a half a million 
revelers flooded the streets for the annual Lake Parade. 
</P>
<P>
	The event, which started in 1991, is now one of Europe's best

dancers -- wound their way through the packed lakeside streets in 
the country's biggest open air party.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Hooligans Use Web for Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARDIFF, Wales (AP) -- The English soccer season got off to a  
violent start as fans of division two clubs, Cardiff City and 
Millwall, fought in the city today after apparently arranging the 
clashes via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen people were hurt and six arrested during a day of  
violence as Cardiff followers fought some of the 700 Millwall 
supporters who went to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	According to police, shoppers cowered in terror as rival gangs  
of hooligans battled in the center of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	An Internet bulletin board contained a number of references to  
the Cardiff City-Millwall match, including details of where the 
violence would start and even a running commentary on the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	One message said the fighting had begun and added, ``Don't miss  
the tear-up of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another suggested a rendezvous for any hooligans looking for a  
fight: ``11 o'clock Cardiff Central, where we go from there its up 
to u.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the National Criminal Intelligence Service  
published its annual report, which highlighted the dangers posed by 
organized gangs of thugs using the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which showed the first rise in the number of arrests  
for soccer hooliganism in six years, said violent fans were 
becoming more organized.

<HEADLINE>  Jets Stars Respond To Parcells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Coach Bill Parcells vented -- and the New  
York Jets responded. 
</P>
<P>
	One day after being criticized by Parcells for lackluster play  
early in training camp, key members of the Jets' explosive offense 
showcased tremendous plays Saturday in the club's first intrasquad 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	In limited action, quarterback Vinny Testaverde threw for 145  
yards, including sensational touchdown throws of 19 yards to a 
diving Wayne Chrebet and 31 yards to Keyshawn Johnson, who fought 
off a physical defense to snare the pass with only his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Those three players had been part of Parcells' harsh attention  
on Friday, when he wondered aloud when the headliners on his 
``Superstar Central'' offense were going to make an impact. 
Testaverde finished 8-for-16 passing, with no interceptions, with 
Johnson catching three passes for 100 yards and Chrebet two for 33. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things like that don't bother me,'' Johnson said of Parcells'  
criticism. ``It goes in one ear and out the other, that superstar 
stuff. He couldn't have been talking about me. I just come in and 
try to help the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kicker John Hall, who missed a 53-yard field goal attempt,  
connected from 23, 22 and 48 yards. Second-year player Brian Musso, 
fighting for the fourth receiver spot, had four catches for 69 
yards. On defense, linebackers J.J. Syvrud, Olrick Johnson and 
Bryan Cox, along with defensive end Anthony Pleasant, registered 
sacks and safety Victor Green an interception. 
</P>
<P>
	The 90-minute scrimmage, held before approximately 1,000 fans,  
included 91 plays and featured most of the 80-man roster. Included 
in the action was wide receiver Dwight Stone, signed by the team 
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some good and some bad,'' Parcells said.  
</P>
<P>
	Parcells supervised the scrimmage only hours before his former  
star linebacker, Lawrence Taylor, was inducted into the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame at Canton, Ohio. The coach, who was not asked 
to introduce Taylor, elected not to attend the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I can see it,'' said Parcells, who expressed  
irritation over some commentaries criticizing his decision to stay 
away from Canton. ``I'm very proud of him. I heard someone on the 
radio today refer to Parcells' ego and how because he didn't get to 
induct (Taylor) that he didn't go. There could be nothing further 
from the truth.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Gives Gore Campaign Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore may be concerned about  
being perceived as too close to a president who was impeached, but 
that is not stopping him from using Bill Clinton's fund-raising 
prowess to boost his White House hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was speaking Saturday night at a fund-raiser for  
the Gore 2000 presidential campaign committee, the first of a 
series of such events featuring Clinton. The president also will 
attend four fund-raisers in the nation's capital, two next week and 
two on Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's dinner at the State House Convention Center was  
expected to draw 500 of Arkansas' most influential Democrats, with 
each asked to contribute at least $500. Other scheduled speakers 
included Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark.; U.S. Transportation 
Secretary Rodney Slater and Arkansas Attorney General Mark Pryor. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, Gore has told associates he had felt the drag of  
Clinton's impeachment on attempts to get his own campaign in gear 
during the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign officials said last week they were confident the  
public was well past any unease about Clinton and his personal 
behavior. But it was clear Saturday that public pairings of Clinton 
and Gore were planned carefully planned so the politicians would 
not come across as a team. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president arrived in Little Rock separately from  
Clinton, flying in from Chicago where he was speaking to a meeting 
of the Rainbow Coalition. Clinton and Gore were appearing together 
for a private meeting with farmers and African-American ministers 
before the fund-raising dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign has stressed that the president plays no  
hands-on role in stump strategy -- even as the campaign takes 
advantage of Clinton's ability to invigorate Democrats in the face 
of a primary challenge from Sen. Bill Bradley, and the possibility 
of a tough race against the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Clinton strategist Paul Begala, who is supporting Gore  
from the sidelines, said Gore only stands to benefit from having 
Clinton in his corner, in terms of fund raising and putting the 
full force of presidential power behind Gore's policy ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This slavish devotion to Bush's lead in the polls is breeding  
a surrenderist strategy among a few faint-hearted Democrats,'' 
Begala said. ``I don't think people are going to say, 'Clinton 
cheated on his wife, so let's go back to Reaganomics and give more 
tax cuts to the rich.' And that's exactly what the other side, the 
Republicans would do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore and Clinton were teaming up again on the campaign  
trail, the Bradley team watched from the sidelines with little 
noticeable interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``All presidential elections are about the future and people are  
going to make a judgment of who they want for the future, not so 
much a calculation about the past,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric 
Hauser.

<HEADLINE> Walden Looking for Menifee Race Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Trainer Elliott Walden can only hope that  
history repeats itself for Menifee in Sunday's $1 million Haskell 
Invitational at Monmouth Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, who has never raced at the same track twice, will be  
returning to the site where he broke his maiden on July 16, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides returning to the Jersey shore track, Menifee should also  
benefit from having regular jockey Pat Day in the saddle. 
</P>
<P>
	Day had his choice of riding either favored Menifee, who was  
second in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, or 2-1 second choice 
Cat Thief. 
</P>
<P>
	It probably wasn't a hard decision for Day. The two 3-year-olds  
have gone head-to-head four times and Menifee has come out ahead 
each time. 
</P>
<P>
	``My horse beat Cat Thief three times this year,'' Walden said.  
``I don't know if he'll beat him again on Sunday or not but I think 
that advantage was part of Pat's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat has ridden Menifee in all but his first start and he has a  
lot of faith in him, as do I.'' said Walden. ``I think he made the 
right decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only question with Menifee seems to be whether he can  
rebound from a disappointing eighth-place finish in the Belmont 
Stakes on June 5. Prior to that, he had run either first or second 
in every race he had entered. He has not raced since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why he ran so poorly,'' Walden said. ``It was  
uncharacteristic. Maybe he had a virus, maybe he was just at the 
end of a long road. He's been off for a while and he seems good 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee's chief competition should come from Cat Thief, who is  
trained by D. Wayne Lukas and will be ridden by Mike Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief won the Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park on July 18 with  
Day in the saddle after finishing third in the Kentucky Derby and 
seventh in the Preakness. He did not enter the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who is two-for-two in the Haskell, is hoping for a replay  
of last year's race when his horse Coronado's Quest took the lead 
and held on to beat Walden's Victory Gallop down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monmouth has always been a speed favoring track and I think  
that suits Cat Thief,'' said Smith. ``You can use the speed to your 
advantage. That's what I did with Coronado's Quest. I opened up 
enough around the far turn so that Victory Gallop couldn't come and 
get us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If either of the favorites, who have drawn the seventh and  
eighth post positions, falter Bob Baffert's Forestry could step up 
with Jerry Bailey on board. The 4-1 third choice has won six of 
eight starts, including the last five in a row. His latest success 
coming in the Grade 2 Dwyer Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll be better than he was in the Dwyer,'' Baffert  
said. ``He didn't go through the Triple Crown so he's a fresh horse 
and that may be the advantage we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other horses in the Haskell field include Woodcarver, Prime  
Directive, Ghost Story, Unbridled Jet and Ecton Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecton Park has also been entered in Sunday's Grade 2 Jim Dandy  
Stakes at Saratoga and it Walden may run him there.

<HEADLINE> Fusion 2, MetroStars 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Saul Martinez scored his first two  
goals in Major League Soccer as the Miami Fusion won their first 
game since losing top scorer Diego Serna, beating the New York-New 
Jersey MetroStars 2-0 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars suffered their fourth consecutive shutout and now  
have gone 366 minutes since scoring, an MLS record. Their last goal 
came in a 3-2 loss to New England on July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez scored in the opening minute of the second half and  
again in the 56th minute to become the first Fusion player this 
year to score more than once in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson Vargas and Welton each had two assists and Garth Lagerwey  
made four saves to notch his third shutout. 
</P>
<P>
	Their performance easily made up for the loss of Serna, out for  
the season after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament in last 
Sunday's 4-0 loss to Columbus. Serna was fourth in MLS with 10 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami (9-13) won for the fifth time in its past six games and  
moved into third place in the Eastern Conference. The MetroStars 
(5-15) have lost 11 of 12.

<P>
	After a scoreless first half, Martinez entered as a substitute  
and immediately made an impact. He faked goalkeeper Mike Ammann to 
the ground, leaped over his defender and put the ball in the left 
corner of the open net. 
</P>
<P>
	It took just 10 minutes for Martinez to make the score 2-0.  
After taking a cross from Vargas, he weaved between two defenders 
and shot past Ammann. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, 23, was discovered during an invitational tryout in  
February. The Honduras native had 13 goals and three assists in two 
years with the Long Island Rough Riders of the A-League.

<HEADLINE> Official: Russia Must Wean Off Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia needs to wean itself from foreign aid that  
it has been ``eating through'' without achieving long-term 
structural gain, the country's top envoy to international lenders 
said in an interview published Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikhail Zadornov also warned that foreign investors will not  
return to Russia until after elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Zadornov's comments in the business daily Kommersant contrasted  
with the optimism among many officials -- including President Boris 
Yeltsin -- after two recent deals with foreign lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund resumed aid to Russia last  
month, disbursing part of a $4.5 billion loan that is the first 
substantial credit for the country since a financial crisis hit a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Russia convinced the Paris Club of creditors to reschedule  
$8 billion in Soviet-era foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the agreements come nowhere near the comprehensive  
rescheduling that Russia is seeking for its $150 billion foreign 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Zadornov, a former finance minister, acknowledged that the deals  
would provide welcome temporary relief, but said Russia should be 
concentrating on better using foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia should ``not just eat through (loans), as we often did in  
recent years,'' he said. ``We should gradually stop the loans from 
the IMF.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also told Kommersant that Russia shouldn't rely on foreign  
investors to boost the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Private investors will not come to us before the elections,''  
Zadornov said. He did not indicate whether he meant December 
parliamentary elections or presidential polls scheduled for next 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Many foreign investors have pulled out of Russia or scaled back  
since the government defaulted on some debt and devalued the ruble 
last August, freezing the banking system and pummeling Russia's 
financial markets.

	Clinton Pledges Poverty Fight  
</P>
<P>
	HELENA, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton today promised to devote  
the rest of his term to eliminating the poverty that clings to this 
neglected corner of his home state and other parts of the delta 
region, where unemployment is twice the national averageplaces like 
this neglected corner of his home state. Clinton stopped in Helena 
for a private meeting with 54 local officials, who are organizing a 
commission to take on the enormous problems of the Mississippi 
Delta, from education to housing and civic infrastructure. The 
president submitted his so-called ``new markets'' legislative 
proposal to Congress last week. It includes a series of tax 
incentives and lending guarantees for new investment.

	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- A black man assumed control of  
South Africa's all-important central bank today, moving forward the 
country's transformation from a white-dominated land to a 
multiracial society. Tito Mboweni, a former labor minister, becomes 
Reserve Bank governor while most of South Africa's majority blacks 
remain mired in poverty five years after apartheid collapsed. 
Mboweni shoved aside notions that the Reserve Bank should 
accelerate the transformation of South Africa from a society where 
only whites had privilege to one where opportunity awaited 
everyone, saying: ``Our role is to ensure there is a stable 
financial environment. Our mandate is very narrow.''

accused fellow Republicans in Washington of trying to renege on 
pledges to ship the money to states. They suggested the development

congressional leaders have considered asking the nation's governors 
to return up to $6 billion in welfare money to help balance the

hundreds of ethnic Albanians trying to cross into the Serb section 
of a northern Kosovo town. As this simmering dispute over free 
movement erupted, soldiers kept the ethnic Albanians from crossing 
a bridge over the Ibar River. An equally agitated Serb crowd jeered 
from the far side. Local leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the 
ethnic Albanian guerrilla group being disbanded under an agreement 
with NATO, led the protest and eventually persuaded the crowd to 
disperse after the four people arrested were freed.

University struggled to digest news of an investigation into 
alleged irregularities involving an SMU defensive line coach. The 
mere whiff of alleged impropriety is enough to rattle SMU faithful 
still recovering from the shame of the 1980s football scandal that 
earned the only NCAA death penalty ever imposed. SMU athletic 
director Jim Copeland announced late Friday that the alleged 
problems surrounding assistant coach Steve Malin, were uncovered 
about 2 1/2 weeks ago during a routine compliance check.

<P>
	WINNEMUCCA, Nev. (AP) -- Cooler temperatures and higher humidity  
helped firefighters make progress Saturday in their battle against 
more than 100 fires that had blackened 1 million acres of brush and 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
	However, flames threatened numerous ranch structures in the  
Denio area near the Oregon border and a state transportation 
department maintenance station on I-80 west of Elko. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, two homes were burned near Elko.  
</P>
<P>
	Most of the fires were burning along a 200-mile stretch of  
Interstate 80, northern Nevada's major artery, between Lovelock and 
Elko. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here for four decades and I've never seen anything  
like this,'' said Bureau of Land Management spokesman Bob Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	The fires had blackened more than 1,500 square miles, an area  
larger than Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	No estimated containment time for the fires was being offered,  
said firefighters' spokeswoman Judith Dyess. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the fires in remote, uninhabited range had been started  
by lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke intermittently closed Interstate 80 on Friday near  
Lovelock, Winnemucca, Battle Mountain and Elko.

<HEADLINE> Krayzelburg Sets Backstroke Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Lenny Krayzelburg broke his own American  
record in the 200-meter backstroke Saturday in the second day of 
competition of the National Swimming Championships at the 
University of Minnesota Aquatic Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Krayzelburg was on pace to snap the world mark, held by Spain's  
Martin Zubero (1 minute, 56.57 seconds), but the 23-year-old 
resident of Studio City, Calif., finished in 1:56.68 to win his 
ninth national title. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending world champion Jenny Thompson narrowly missed breaking  
her own national record in the 100-meter freestyle. Thompson, of 
Menlo Park, Calif., finished in 54.66, just 0.18 seconds off the 
mark she set in 1992. It was the 21st national title for the 
26-year-old Thompson, who moved into a tie for 11th place on the 
career list of American national titles with Gary Hall and Eleanor 
Holm-Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	Four-time 1996 Olympic gold medalist Amy Van Dyken, absent from  
competition since the 1998 Spring Nationals due to shoulder 
surgery, came in second (55.99) despite having to wear a men's body 
suit after breaking two of her own while getting dressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Youth dominated the 200-meter breaststroke, as 14-year-old  
Kristen Caverly (2:30.11) and 17-year-old Brendan Hansen (2:16.07) 
earned national titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Other champions included Jason Lezak in the men's 100-meter  
freestyle (49.34), Lindsay Benko in the women's 200 backstroke 
(2:12.26), Misty Hyman in the women's 200 butterfly (2:10.14) and 
Ugur Taner in the men's 200 butterfly (1:58.82). 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,400 swimmers are competing in the five-day meet, which  
should produce 10 additional qualifiers for the U.S. team in the 
Pan Pacific Games Aug. 22-28 in Sydney, Australia.

<HEADLINE> Defected Cuban Coach Looking for Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Cuban pitching coach who defected in  
Baltimore two months ago still is waiting for permission to work in 
the United States, his dreams of working for a major league team on 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigoberto Betancourt Herrera did not return with the Cuban team  
that played an exhibition game in early May against the Orioles in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Within weeks of slipping out of the Sheraton Inner Harbor Hotel  
and hiding beneath a row of bushes for six hours in downtown 
Baltimore before seeking asylum at a police station, Betancourt 
Herrera said, the Boston Red Sox interviewed him for a job, 
coaching minor leaguers at their training camp in Fort Myers, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	That was more than two months ago. The U.S. Immigration and  
Naturalization Service has granted Betancourt Herrera political 
asylum. But under INS rules, he has to wait until October to apply 
for a work permit. It could take a few more months before 
permission is granted. 
</P>
<P>
	Betancourt Herrera told The (Baltimore) Sun he's worried that a  
job with the Red Sox could be gone by then. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Qualls, the team's director of player development, said  
nothing is guaranteed until Betancourt Herrera receives INS 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until he gets his working papers, there's nothing to talk  
about,'' Qualls said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were working, I'd be the happiest man in the world,''  
Betancourt Herrera, 55, said. ``Now, I'm worried. I don't have any 
doubts about my decision. But I have doubts about working in this 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 feet, 6 inches, Betancourt Herrera became known as the  
``Little Giant,'' a pitcher who could ring up as many as 18 
strikeouts a game. He was later selected to the national teams that 
played during the Central American-Caribbean games in Puerto Rico 
in 1966 and the Pan American Games in Winnipeg in 1967.

<HEADLINE> Saudis To Boycott Qatar Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOHA, Qatar (AP) -- Saudi Arabia will boycott a handball  
tournament in Qatar later this month because of the presence of an 
Israeli team, al-Sharq newspaper reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia has officially informed Qatar's Foreign Ministry  
that it will not attend the World Youth Handball Tournament, the 
paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi officials were not available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia does not recognize the state of Israel, believing  
it is usurped Palestinian land. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's participation in games has also been condemned by many  
Qataris. The Qatari press lashed out at the government for allowing 
Israel to participate and has urged the public to boycott the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Qatar has limited commercial ties with the Jewish state, but no  
diplomatic ties. Most Qataris sympathize with fellow-Arab 
Palestinians, Lebanese and Syrians in their territorial disputes 
with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Qatari officials have said the Israelis were welcome and that  
they would secure visas for Israeli fans if requested, in keeping 
with the rules of the International Handball Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-two teams were to participate in the Aug. 22 to Sept. 6  
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Arab teams that are to take part are Egypt, Tunis,  
Bahrain, Kuwait and host Qatar. 
</P>
<P>
	Qatar has been trying to promote itself as a sports venue and is  
the first Gulf country to regularly host international meets. The 
emirate hopes to win the right to stage the 2006 Asian Games.

	The others were Eric Dickerson, the NFL's third leading career  
rusher; Tom Mack, a guard who played 13 years for the Los Angeles 
Rams; Ozzie Newsome, a tight end for the Cleveland Browns; and 
Billy Shaw, a guard for the Buffalo Bills from 1961-69 who became 
the first Hall of Famer to spend his entire career in the old 
American Football League. 
</P>
<P>
	But Taylor, whose election last January was preceded by several  
weeks of controversy because of his drug arrests and suspensions, 
was clearly the star of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheered on by a large contingent of New York fans chanting ``LT,  
LT,'' he seemed ready to make peace with his troubled past. 
</P>
<P>
	And it started with the introduction by his 17-year old son,  
Lawrence Taylor Jr. -- called T.J. by friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could pick anyone to be my father, I'd pick Lawrence  
Taylor,'' T.J. said. That prompted his Dad to say: 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a bet with Bill Parcells that I wouldn't cry. I almost  
lost the bet there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as emotional was the induction of Newsome, the leading  
receiver among tight ends. He played his entire career with the 
Cleveland Browns, but as the team's personnel director moved to 
Baltimore when owner Art Modell moved the franchise there. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell was booed when his image appeared on the big screen  
showing highlights. 
</P>
<P>
	But Newsome was roundly cheered by the ``Dawg Pound,'' the  
famous Cleveland fan section that will be revived when the new 
expansion Browns begin play this season. And he won them over 
completely when he concluded his induction speech by saying: 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a cause for celebration. Today we have that cause  
because in 1999 there is football back on the lakefront. There's a 
song that's been playing in my head for the past three of four 
hours. It's 'Here we go again.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, there was some levity.  
</P>
<P>
	After Shaw thanked his children, coaches, employers and just  
about everyone but his dog, it was Dickerson's turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last few days we talked about who was going to forget  
someone,'' Dickerson said, looking toward where Shaw's wife was 
sitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat Shaw would you please stand up.'' She did, to applause and  
laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was the last of the five to be inducted. On hand were his  
parents, his ex-wife and his three children to whom he said: 
``Thank you for putting up with me for all those years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also got emotional when he saw Harry Carson, his former  
teammate who had openly criticized Taylor's off-field conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's class,'' Taylor said to Carson. ``I love you, man.''  
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said the three people who most influenced his career with  
the Giants from 1981-93 were Parcells, who coached him; George 
Young, the general manager then, and Wellington Mara, the owner. 
</P>
<P>
	He paid special tribute to Mara, who tried to help Taylor with  
his drug problems, saying: 
</P>
<P>
	``He probably cared more about me as a person than he really  
should have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the final, most touching tribute was from Taylor's own son.  
</P>
<P>
	``You people,'' T.J. said, pointing to bleachers full of fans  
wearing Giants' number ``56'' shirts, ``love him for being LT. I 
love him not for being LT, but for being Lawrence Taylor, my

<HEADLINE> Cubs May Open 2000 in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs players are willing to open the 2000  
baseball season with a two-game series against the New York Mets in 
Japan if an acceptable agreement can be worked out with the players 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't a vote, but the team has agreed we want to go,''  
player representative Steve Trachsel said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Issues that still need to be decided are flight schedules,  
accommodations, off days and the number of family members allowed 
to go along, Trachsel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The experience would be great. I think we're the last major  
sport not to play overseas. That would be great to expand the 
sport, and of course Sammy's popularity is a big thing,'' Trachsel 
said, referring to Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa traveled with Major League Baseball's postseason exhibition  
team last fall and was hailed by Japanese fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs will wait to take an official vote on the offer until  
after negotiations with Japanese officials are over.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Wet While Nation Broils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The city that prides itself for having at least  
300 days of sunshine a year is experiencing an unusual amount of 
rainfall -- while much of the country suffers under drought 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, rainfall in Colorado is up 50 percent in some areas  
thanks to wet spells this month and in late May and early June. 
Denver this week reached its usual annual precipitation total of 16 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday arrived dry and sunny, a sharp change from the steady  
rain that has left Denver seeming more like soggy Seattle. Colorado 
Springs reported 4.21 inches of rain in 24 hours Thursday, breaking 
the city's record. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, drought conditions have crippled much of the East  
Coast and states as far inland as Kentucky. The drought is the 
worst ever for farmers in Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and Rhode 
Island. To provide some relief, the Senate on Wednesday approved 
$7.4 billion in emergency farm aid. 
</P>
<P>
	For Colorado, the wet weather has brought its own problems.  
</P>
<P>
	Slugs are turning up everywhere, and so are mushrooms.  
</P>
<P>
	Mudslides have caused more than $1.6 million in damage, the  
Colorado Department of Transportation estimates. Buildings were 
flooded on the campuses of Colorado State University in Fort 
Collins and the University of Colorado in Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	In southeastern Colorado, prized melon crops receiving double  
the normal amount of rain are threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pueblo, the city has received more complaints about weeds  
this year than in the past 15 years. Carl Olson, city planning 
director, is getting 30 to 40 calls a day complaining about uncut 
weeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weed growth has been fantastic. Too bad we can't harvest  
it and eat it In my front yard,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nebraska, heavy storms on Saturday drenched the eastern part  
of the state, setting off flash floods that left at least one man 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	While the drought has hit hard in the East, other states besides  
Colorado have seen unusually wet weather, including Arizona, Utah, 
Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Major Golf Courses Getting Longer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- At this rate, it might not be long before a  
major championship is contested on a golf course measuring 8,000 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I don't ever see one,'' Justin Leonard said. ``It might  
make caddies obsolete, because they won't be able to walk that 
far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That may be stretching it, but the truth is in the yardage book.  
</P>
<P>
	Of all the changes made to Augusta National Golf Club for this  
year's Masters, most of the attention was on the teeing areas moved 
back 25 yards on Nos. 2 and 17. Carnoustie Golf Links, already the 
toughest links course in the world, was the longest course in 
British Open history, measuring a mighty 7,361 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinehurst No. 2 was the longest par-70 for a U.S. Open in 44  
years. It featured six par-4s of at least 445 yards, including two 
of more than 480 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	And now this.  
</P>
<P>
	Medinah Country Club, site of the 81st PGA Championship that  
starts Thursday, will play at an estimated 7,401 yards. That's the 
longest course in a major championship since 1967, when the PGA was 
played at Columbine Country Club, 7,436 yards long in the mile-high 
air outside Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods played Medinah, a three-time U.S. Open site, six  
weeks ago when he was in Chicago for the Western Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to the course superintendent. He said the PGA of  
America wants the golf course to play harder than it was in the 
U.S. Open,'' Woods said. ``Obviously, it will play a little longer 
than it was in the U.S. Open. And it will probably play pretty 
tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that anyone should be surprised.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, Dan Pohl led the PGA Tour in driving distance at 274.3  
yards. Going into the Buick Open, 75 players averaged longer off 
the tee, and the average for drives among all PGA Tour players was 
272.4 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game has changed,'' Mark O'Meara said. ``In the last 10  
years, it's a power game -- but it's a power game with touch. When I 
go out and play with Tiger and David Duval, these guys are hitting 
40 yards by me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly how long Medinah will play won't be known until the  
championship starts Thursday. Woods thinks the tee boxes will be up 
on a few holes, meaning it might be ``only'' 7,300-plus. And 
defending champion Vijay Singh notes that most of the yardage can 
be accounted for on the par-5s -- the shortest is 530 yards, the 
other three are over 580 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although it's playing 7,400 yards, a lot of holes are going  
downhill,'' Singh said. ``And most of the par-5s are long, so 
that's where all the distances are. The tour's average is quite 
long now, so I don't think it's going to play anywhere as long as 
what they say it will for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not to say Medinah won't play plenty tough.  
</P>
<P>
	Medinah was the site of the 1949, 1975 and 1990 U.S. Opens. And  
while it never played quite this long, it has a reputation of 
putting up a good fight to protect par. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Middlecoff and Lou Graham won the first two Opens over-par.  
Hale Irwin was 8-under-par in 1990, but that was partially because 
the USGA mowed the rough and Mother Nature dumped enough rain to 
take the fright out of the slick, rock-hard greens. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the players are longer because of titanium, graphite  
shafts, high-tech balls and their own conditioning, Medinah won't 
be reduced to driver-pitching wedge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm practicing with a lot of 3- and 4-irons ... knowing that's  
coming up,'' said Leonard, who also took a sneak peek of Medinah 
during the Western Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to have to drive the ball well because of the  
length of the golf course,'' he said. ``You're going to have to hit 
it straight. You're going to have to hit some good mid- to 
long-iron shots. It's going to test everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The majors have clearly tested everything this year, although  
length isn't the sole factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Maria Olazabal won the Masters with the lowest score of any  
major in 1999, an 8-under 280. Payne Stewart conquered the 
domed-shaped greens of Pinehurst that were particularly difficult 
to hold with long irons. He won at 1-under 279. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of length, wind and fairways as wide as a  
model's waist made Carnoustie a brute. Paul Lawrie won a playoff 
after finishing at 6-over 290. 
</P>
<P>
	``These golf courses certainly have held up,'' Leonard said.  
</P>
<P>
	There is one test left on what is known as the ``Monster of the  
Midwest.'' Medinah combines its length with 4,161 trees that could 
be a daunting view from the tee box. The edge goes to the player 
who can keep it in the short grass. It won't hurt to be long off 
the tee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said there's no course that's not good for a long  
hitter if he plays well,'' Fred Couples said. ``That's an 
advantage.''

<HEADLINE> Racer Fernandez Out Indefinitely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Patrick Racing driver Adrian Fernandez is out  
indefinitely while he recuperates from surgery to repair his broken 
right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez was injured during Friday morning's practice session  
for the Tenneco Automotive Grand Prix of Detroit when he crashed in 
Turn 2. He was flown to Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis late 
Friday and had surgery to insert a plate and screws. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury forced Patrick to withdraw Fernandez' car from  
qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is obviously a very unfortunate and sad situation,'' team  
owner Pat Patrick said Saturday. ``Adrian was off to a very strong 
start and is a contender for the PPG Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important things are that he receives the best  
medical care possible and that he has a full recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick said Dr. Terry Trammell, CART's chief orthopedic  
consultant, will examine Fernandez to determine the amount of time 
he will be sidelined from the Indy-car circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez is currently fifth in the FedEx Series championship  
points standings with 95 points. He had finished in the top six in 
the last five races. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DRIVER SEARCH:* The search is on for another Canadian driver to  
replace Greg Moore, who is leaving the Players Forsythe Racing Team 
at the end of the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, along with Gil de Feran, will drive for Penske Racing  
beginning next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's with mixed feelings that we will be ending our  
relationship with Greg at the end of this season,'' Mark Thorne, 
marketing communications manager for the Players team, said 
Saturday at a news conference. ``We will now provide another 
Canadian driver with the opportunity to make the jump to CART and 
follow in the footsteps of Jacques Villeneuve, Greg Moore and 
Patrick Carpentier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thorne would not identify who the new driver will be. He said  
the team is scheduling testing with various drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Players will continue to sponsor a two-car team next year,  
Thorne said. However, he noted that all of Players' auto racing 
sponsorship will cease in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to (team owner) Jerry (Forsythe) and to  
Players Forsythe Racing next year at the two-car level,'' said 
Thorne. ``With the Canadian tobacco legislation, currently there 
will be restrictions placed on us in the year 2000 as to the way we 
advertise. Unfortunately in October 2003, we will not be able to 
sponsor many activities and the racing program will come to a 
halt.''

</P>
<P>
	 *SUPER SUB:* Roberto Moreno, also known as ``super sub,'' made a  
super jump in Saturday's final round of qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Filling in for the injured Christian Fittipaldi, Moreno sped to  
the fifth-fastest qualifying lap of 114.338 mph. On Friday, he had 
the 19th best speed of 110.501. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely happy,'' Moreno said. ``After Friday, I knew the  
only thing we could do was get better. The car was very good today. 
The team did a wonderful job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fittipaldi was injured Monday when he crashed his Newman-Haas  
car during testing at Gateway International Raceway in Madison, 
Ill. He suffered a subdural hematoma and is out indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno is fresh off subbing for eight races for PacWest's Mark  
Blundell, who had been out 12 weeks with a burst fracture of his 
seventh cervical vertebrae. Sunday's race will be his eighth career 
start as a driver for Newman-Haas. His best finish with the team 
was fifth place in 1997 at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good place for me to switch teams and get used to  
the car,'' Moreno said. ``Most of my career has been on street 
courses. We'll still have room for lots of improvement.''

	 *MOTORSPORTS WEB SITE:* PPG Industries, Inc., one of the leading  
sponsors in auto racing, has launched ppgmotorsports.com -- an 
Internet site dedicated to CART, NASCAR, the Indy Racing League and 
Indy Lights. 
</P>
<P>
	The site offers news commentary, exclusive interviews, PPG  
merchandise and free screen savers featuring the PPG pace cars.

<P>
	``The popularity of the Internet and motor sports is growing at  
an incredible pace,'' said Rich Zahren, PPG vice president of

Lights event with current points standings and other information.

<HEADLINE> Southern Party Holds Inaugural Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLAT ROCK, N.C. (AP) -- The Southern Party's inaugural rally drew  
150 supporters Saturday, many in Confederate grey, while party 
leaders pledged to work for a separate Southern nation 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders said this time their struggle would be a peaceful one,  
and short-term goals were to win elections. ``We expect the 
struggle for Southern independence to be a long and tedious 
battle,'' said George Kalas of Houston, the party chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	He condemned violent means and likened the party's efforts to  
independence struggles in Quebec, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally was held at an inn where Confederate troops lodged  
during the Civil War. The overwhelmingly white crowd sang 
``Dixie.'' One black woman attended the rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering themselves the philosophical heirs to the  
Confederate States of America, the Southern Party has registered 
with the Federal Election Commission and in Florida, Georgia, Texas 
and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Party leaders are hoping to eventually send enough members to  
Congress to one day form a separate Southern nation. Party vice 
chairman Jerry Baxley said it was time to fulfill Confederate 
President Jefferson Davis' prophecy that ``the South would rise 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics have said the group presents a narrow view of the  
South that leaves out blacks and other minorities. Party members 
repeatedly denied that they are racist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Southerners are not a race, they are a people,'' said Kalas,  
whose father is a Greek immigrant. ``There's simply no room in the 
Southern Party for people who are racially bigoted against 
others.''

<HEADLINE> Braves Helped by Odd Foul Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Braves infielders looked like a bunch of  
Little Leaguers when they let an infield pop-up drop between them 
in the ninth inning of Saturday's 15-4 victory over the San 
Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	But quick thinking by shortstop Ozzie Guillen turned the miscue  
into an unusual foul ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The towering pop by J.T. Snow fell on the pitcher's mound when  
second baseman Bret Boone called off the other infielders, then 
couldn't reach the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen let it bounce toward the third-base line. As soon as it  
crossed into foul territory, he grabbed the ball -- turning it into 
a mere foul. Snow then flied out to Ryan Klesko in left field. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you play 20 years in baseball, you've seen it all,''  
Guillen said. ``It's funny when the game is 15-4. It wouldn't have 
been if the score was 1-0.''

<HEADLINE> Montoya Wins Detroit Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Rookie sensation Juan Montoya edged Paul Tracy by  
.040 of a second Saturday to earn his fifth pole of the season with 
a lap of 114.773 mph at the Tenneco Automotive Grand Prix of 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya brushed the wall, leaving a trail of sparks during his  
fastest lap. But it didn't slow him down much on the 2.3-mile 
temporary road course on Belle Isle, in the middle of the Detroit 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just touched the wall,'' Montoya said. ``That didn't help  
me, but it didn't slow me down. It didn't damage the car at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gil de Ferran, who made news off the track this weekend by  
signing a three-year contract to drive for Roger Penske, starting 
in 2000, was third in the final qualifying. He will start beside 
Dario Franchitti in the second row. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifying is vital because the Belle Isle course is very  
narrow, making passing next to impossible. Last year's race, for 
example, was won by Alex Zanardi, who led for 50 of the 72 laps. 
Pole-sitter Greg Moore led the first 22 laps before relinquishing 
the lead to Zanardi during a pit stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, who leads the CART FedEx Series championship race with  
129 points -- 13 better than Franchitti -- will be aiming for his 
fifth victory of the season. He is the only driver on the circuit 
with more than one win. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he is a rookie on the CART circuit, Montoya, the  
23-year-old racer from Colombia, drove this course in 1994 during a 
support race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like this track,'' Montoya said.  
</P>
<P>
	The course has been changed somewhat since then, but nothing new  
seems to bother him. Montoya, who finished second in the U.S. 500, 
has won at Long Beach, Nazareth, Rio and Cleveland. Two of those 
victories were on ovals, two on road courses like Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy, who won the provisional pole on Friday, blamed himself  
for not holding it. He hasn't started on the pole since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the tires were fresh, I pushed hard and that was a  
mistake,'' Tracy said. ``I felt there was more time there. But to 
do what we did, seven laps into the run, I felt that was good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy, whose lone victory this season was at Milwaukee, has a  
history of running well in Detroit, winning in 1994. Tracy, who 
finished third in the U.S. 500 at Michigan Speedway two weeks ago, 
was seventh at Detroit in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car was better today,'' Tracy said. ``I just didn't catch  
it right. I just made mistakes at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Ferran, a Brazilian born in France, heads into the Detroit  
race in seventh place in the driver standings. He has earned poles 
at Japan and Toronto this season, and won the race at Portland -- 
his third since joining CART in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	De Ferran has finished third in each of his previous three  
starts on Belle Isle. In those three races, he has been a total of 
15 seconds behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Third is a good position,'' De Ferran said. ``Last year, I  
started ninth and finished third. This year, I start third and 
maybe do a little better. I'd love to move up two places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, 13 points behind Montoya and nine ahead of Michael  
Andretti in the series championship chase, made the biggest move 
between provisional and final qualifying, going from last to 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti hit the wall going into the third turn during  
Friday's provisional run and lost the rear left tire on his primary 
car. He went back out in his backup car, only to have it stall in 
the turn before the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of track time Friday certainly hurt us,'' Franchitti  
said. ``I've been playing catch-up, really. I learn something new 
about the track every time I go out there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thrilled to be starting fourth. It's nice to have a good  
starting spot because you can stay out of trouble in Turn 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adrian Fernandez, fifth in the standings, had surgery late  
Friday at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis to insert a plate and 
screws to close a fracture of the radius bone of his right arm. He 
sustained the injury when his car hit a wall during Friday's 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	No backup car was entered by the Patrick Racing team in place of  
Fernandez, so the race will go with 26 cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Zanardi won't be around to defend his championship. He is  
driving the Formula One circuit this season.

<HEADLINE> Gas Leak Cause of Texas Hotel Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) -- Investigators confirmed Saturday that a  
gas leak was to blame for a blast that ripped through a new hotel, 
seriously burning a man and injuring dozens with broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Marshal Dick Ward said natural gas lines that supplied the  
hotel's swimming pool heater caused the Friday evening explosion at 
the Embassy Suites Outdoor World. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas E. Marcer, a subcontractor who was working on the heater  
when the blast occurred, remained in serious condition Saturday at 
Parkland Hospital in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcer, interviewed by authorities Saturday in his hospital  
room, and another worker apparently didn't know there was gas in 
the line as they worked on it, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no negligence involved by either one of these  
technicians,'' the fire marshal said. ``They were doing their jobs 
properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ward said the gas was ignited either by an electrical pump or an  
ignitor system on the pool equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion blew through an exterior wall and a gift shop only  
three days after the hotel opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten people, including six children, were treated for minor  
injuries at nearby hospitals. About two dozen other people were 
treated by paramedics at the scene for cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the 330-unit hotel, located near Dallas-Fort  
Worth International Airport, might reopen early next week.

<HEADLINE> Mike Ditka Buys La. Restaurant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Mike Ditka has spent the past two seasons  
trying to Ditka-ize the New Orleans Saints. Now, a restaurant is in 
for the same fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike's on the Avenue, where for the past decade chef Mike  
Fennelly mixed the flavors of the American Southwest and several 
Asian countries, was sold to a group headed by Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fare will feature the flavors of New Orleans with the  
steak-and-chop-house fare of Chicago. And, of course, there will be 
a new name: Mike Ditka's Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Saints at training camp in La Crosse, Wis., Ditka  
wanted to talk about football, not food. He declined to discuss the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not football. Next,'' Ditka said.  
</P>
<P>
	Developers plan to have the restaurant open by midseason. What  
are the chances of rubbing shoulders with the coach? 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't expect to see me there,'' Ditka said.

<HEADLINE> Martin Tired of Being No. 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mark Martin is tired of being No. 2 at the  
Brickyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Runner-up to Jeff Gordon in last year's Brickyard 400, Martin  
qualified behind Gordon for a second-place start in today's Winston 
Cup race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is second to Dale Jarrett in the season standings, and  
despite winning on Friday, he finished second to Dale Earnhardt -- 
by a single point -- in this year's International Race of Champions 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think there was a chance in the world to win the IROC  
championship,'' Martin said. ``But once I was in the car, the race 
was on, like always. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, we came kind of close. What Dale Earnhardt did was  
unbelievable, winning three of the four races. We didn't score 
enough points to beat him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt won the IROC championship and a $225,000 prize with 75  
points. Martin finished with 74 points for $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just go race, do the best you can,'' Martin said.  
``Sometimes it's good enough; sometimes it's not. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that is pressure for you just gets to be more and  
more as the season goes on,'' said Martin, who had 12 top-five 
finishes but only one victory in the first 19 Winston Cup starts 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was the only driver to finish among the top six each of  
the past four Brickyard races at Indianapolis. He started seventh 
last year, worked his way to the front and led one lap midway 
through the race after Jarrett ran out of gas. Martin was in second 
place and preparing for a dash to the checkered flag when the race 
ended under the yellow following a crash by defending champion 
Ricky Rudd with two laps to go. 
</P>
<P>
	He also started second in 1996 and led 19 laps before finishing  
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a totally different scenario than qualifying, but we've  
had great races here in the past,'' Martin said. ``The Valvoline 
team is really strong now. They're giving me a great car, and 
they're great in the pits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more important to drive a fast car than to start up front  
with a mediocre car. We look at the pole as a competition within a 
competition. We try to qualify as best we can and then perform our 
best in the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way the season has gone, Martin is lucky he can even drive a  
car. 
</P>
<P>
	Still recovering from multiple fractures from a crash in  
practice at Daytona last month, he's only now starting to feel 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people might call it tough and some people might call it  
dumb,'' he said of driving with the knee, rib and wrist injuries. 
``Getting through Daytona (in 17th place) was unbelievable torture. 
It feels good to drive a car pain-free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's 178.941 mph qualifying speed on Thursday was second  
only to Gordon's record 179.612. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprising David Green, whose average starting position in 17  
previous races this season was 34th, qualified third at 178.902, 
just ahead of Jarrett's 178.859. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 25 qualifiers were locked in place. Most of the others  
gambled their speeds would hold up, while Ted Musgrave, Steve Park 
and Rick Mast re-qualified at faster speeds to gain spots in the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven others, including two-time pole starter Ernie Irvan, were  
added as provisional starters based on owners' points. The others 
were Bobby Hamilton, Chad Little, Johnny Benson, Kenny Wallace, 
Jimmy Spencer and Kevin Lepage. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who failed to make the field were Brett Bodine, the  
Brickyard runner-up in 1994, and veterans Dick Trickle, Morgan 
Shepherd, Rich Bickle and Mike Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	Rusty Wallace, the older brother of Kenny and Mike, qualified  
17th in the 43-car field, hoping to get his 50th career victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got our 49th career win back at Bristol in April and have  
been trying hard to get that 50th win ever since,'' Wallace said. 
``Can you imagine how cool that would be to get the 50th victory in 
the Brickyard 400 at Indy? 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a hell of a way to go down into the history books,  
I can tell you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rusty Wallace was the 1989 Winston Cup champion and is 10th in  
points this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of disappointments this year, a lot of things  
happening to us that we couldn't do anything about,'' he said. ``We 
had a super shot at winning the Daytona 500 back in February and 
lost the thing with 10 laps to go (when he got shuffled to the rear 
of the lead draft). 
</P>
<P>
	``Then we had a pretty good car in Charlotte for the 600 (in  
May) before we crashed out. So, what's left is that third and final 
leg at Indy this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Martin, Wallace knows what it's like to finish second at  
Indy. He was runner-up to Dale Earnhardt by .37 second -- about two 
car-lengths -- in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one race that really sticks out in my mind as one of  
the biggest fish that ever got away,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Viking Coach Fan of Scrimmage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green said  
the injuries to his wide receiving corps won't cause him to 
reconsider his annual intrasquad scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	Jake Reed and Robert Tate both sustained shoulder separations  
and Matthew Hatchette came out with a high ankle sprain in Friday 
night's intrasquad scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	All are expected to be back for the regular season opener Sept.  
12 against Atlanta, but they could miss a good chunk of the 
remainder of training camp, hurting their timing with the 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings didn't start camp until Monday and their first  
exhibition game is Friday against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``You gotta play,'' Green said. ``You're ready to hit this week  
or you're ready to hit next week. The bottom line is injuries occur 
in football. That's just part of the game. We're going to scrimmage 
next week (against the New Orleans Saints in La Crosse, Wis., on 
Monday) and we can't in my opinion wait until we play the Giants to 
start hitting. Then, you'd have more injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green tried to be an optimist regarding his injured players  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tate and Reed have separated shoulders, which are not as  
serious as dislocations. So, we're looking anywhere from two, 
three, four weeks. Maybe two weeks, maybe a little bit more,'' 
Green said. ``Tate's had his before, so it probably heals a little 
faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatchette's high ankle sprain means less swelling but also more  
recovery time, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Green said the Vikings would seek free agent help to restock the  
wide receiving corps during camp to protect starters Cris Carter 
and Randy Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed was beset by injuries all last year, but Green said he was  
confident Reed would be healthy for the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he should be, that's six weeks away, five weeks  
away,'' he said. ``So, we think he should be ready before that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Hatchette, who emerged during Reed's down time last year,  
nobody's sure when he'll be back on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``High ankle sprains normally take longer than you'd think,''  
Green said. ``So, that one is probably a minimum of two weeks and 
it could be a lot longer that that. Matthew has never had an ankle 
injury before.''

<HEADLINE> Banshee Breeze Wins $250K Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Banshee Breeze collared Beautiful  
Pleasure in the stretch and prevailed by a half-length in 
Saturday's $250,000 Go for Wand Handicap at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, Beautiful Pleasure went directly to the lead while  
Jerry Bailey, widest away from the gate, dropped Banshee Breeze 
over to the rail before reaching the first turn, and quickly moved 
her into contending position just behind the leader. Coming into 
the stretch, Banshee Breeze moved to engage Beautiful Pleasure, 
assumed a short lead and held gamely to the precarious advantage 
through the final furlong. 
</P>
<P>
	Beautiful Pleasure held for second, 8 3/4 lengths ahead of Heritage  
of Gold. 
</P>
<P>
	As in her return from a year's inactivity on July 9, Mossflower  
showed no semblance of her best form, finishing a non-threatening 
fourth in the field of five, beating only Diggins. 
</P>
<P>
	Banshee Breeze, last year's 3-year-old filly champion, remained  
undefeated in four starts this year, all in graded stakes. She 
previously won the Fleur De Lis at Churchill Downs and the Apple 
Blossom and Rampart, both at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twelve pounds is a lot of weight to give up. She's been a  
beautiful thing and training this kind of filly is not hard work; 
you just point her in the right direction,'' winning trainer Carl 
Nafzger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Banshee Breeze, high-weighted at 124 pounds, went 1 1/8 miles in  
1:49 4-5 on the fast track to earn $150,000 for Jayeff B Stables 
and James B. Tafel. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner returned $3.30, $2.30 and $2.10. Beautiful Pleasure  
paid $2.90 and $2.10 and Heritage of Gold was worth $2.10.

<HEADLINE> China Airlines To Buy From Airbus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's China Airlines will sign a  
contract with Europe's Airbus Industrie to purchase 15 passenger 
jets next week, scrapping an earlier plan to buy them from Boeing, 
the state-run news agency reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase of the A340 and A330 jets instead of Boeing's 777  
jets was purely a business decision and had nothing to do with 
politics, the Central News Agency quoted China Airlines' Chairman 
Chiang Hung-yi as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. newspapers have reported China Airlines was told to cancel  
the $2 billion order from Boeing in protest of the Clinton 
administration's mainland China policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing officials were traveling to Taipei to sign a larger order  
from China Airlines for 13 747-400 freighters worth $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's China Times quoted unnamed sources as saying the  
government-controlled China Airlines switched its order to Airbus 
to help the island acquire weapons and gain diplomatic support from 
European nations. 
</P>
<P>
	But China Airlines spokesman Hamilton Liu said although interest  
groups had lobbied hard for the jet order, it was ultimately a 
business decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying the Airbus jets was part of a plan to phase out aging  
MD-11 and 747-200 aircraft from China Airlines's fleet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration angered Taiwan when it appeared to  
side with China in a spat between Beijing and Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
	It all started last month, when Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui  
said Taiwan and China should regard each other on a 
``state-to-state'' basis. The statement infuriated Beijing, which 
sees Taiwan as a renegade province that must one day return to 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration then reiterated its support for  
Beijing's stance that there is but one China and asked Taiwan not 
to challenge the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
	In a dispatch from Macedonia where he was visiting with Premier  
Vincent Siew, the China Airlines chairman was quoted saying the 
decision to switch to Airbus ``was completely unrelated'' with the 
statehood issue.

<HEADLINE>  Joe DiMaggio's Only Child Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio Jr., the troubled son of the baseball Hall of Famer  
and a pallbearer at his father's funeral in March, died at a 
hospital in Antioch, Calif., apparently of natural causes, 
relatives and hospital officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, 57, was not breathing and had no heartbeat when he was  
brought by ambulance to Sutter Delta Medical Center late Friday 
night, hospital spokeswoman Nancy Monfort said. Attempts at 
resuscitation were unsuccessful and he died about 11:25 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Monfort said the cause of death was not known, it was  
believed to be from natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was the only child of Joe DiMaggio and Dorothy Arnold,  
an actress whom the elder DiMaggio married in 1939 and divorced 
five years later. The elder DiMaggio did not have any children with 
his second wife, Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Jr., who struggled with substance abuse and homelessness  
during the last two decades, was estranged from his father and saw 
him infrequently in recent years. He was divorced and had two 
adopted daughters who were doted upon by their grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Amato Goodman, a cousin whose son was a close friend of  
DiMaggio, said the son was unable to cope with his father's fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a brilliant mind. He was one of the intelligentsia,''  
Goodman said. ``He lived in the shadow of his father and could not 
rise above that. 
</P>
<P>
	``He marched to a different drummer. He was very sensitive to  
the people close to him,'' she said. ``He really was not a bad boy. 
He was confused about a lot of issues in his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris Engelberg, a close friend and attorney for the elder  
DiMaggio, said, ``It's very sad. He loved his father. He turned 
down a seven-figure offer to do a book about Joe, as much as he 
could have used the money. He was broke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg said Joe Jr. had suffered from asthma.  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio attended Yale, but dropped out to enroll in the  
Marines. In the mid-1970s, he had a blood clot removed from his 
head following a car accident. During the past two decades, he 
battled drug and alcohol problems. He often lived alone on the 
street, and took shelter at one point in a trucking container. For 
a while, he was the manager of a trucking company in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1995, he fractured his leg when the bicycle he was  
riding hit a van. He had a permanent limp after the accident, and 
was cited by the California Highway Patrol for operating a bicycle 
under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph DiMaggio Jr.'s middle name was Paul, the same as his  
father and uncles, Vince and Dominic, both of whom also played in 
the major leagues. Joe DiMaggio Sr. once explained, ``Saint Paul 
was my father's favorite saint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger DiMaggio and his wife, Susan, adopted daughters  
Paula and Katherine in the 1960s, but the marriage collapsed after 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder DiMaggio set up a trust fund that was to pay his son  
$20,000 a year. The bequest, in a will signed May 21, 1996, 
appeared to be the smallest gift in the document, which also 
established trust funds for DiMaggio's two grandchildren and four 
great-grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Joe DiMaggio's Only Child Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANTIOCH, Calif. (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio Jr., the only child of  
baseball great Joe DiMaggio, died at a local hospital apparently of 
natural causes, relatives and hospital officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, 57, was one of the six pallbearers at the funeral of  
his father in March. He was estranged from his father, though, and 
had seen him infrequently in the years before the elder DiMaggio's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the only son of DiMaggio and Dorothy Arnold, an actress  
whom the elder DiMaggio married in 1939. The elder DiMaggio did not 
have any children with his second wife, Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger DiMaggio, who was divorced, had two stepdaughters  
with whom his father was very attached and doted over as a 
grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio Jr. was not breathing and had no heartbeat when he  
was brought by ambulance to Sutter Delta Medical Center late Friday 
night, hospital spokeswoman Nancy Monfort said. Attempts at 
resuscitation were unsuccessful and he died about 11:25 p.m. PDT, 
Monfort said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who was living in Pittsburg, had a history of drug and  
alcohol abuse and had several minor scrapes with police. He had 
been homeless for periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Monfort said the cause of death was not known, she said  
it was believed to be from natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Amato Goodman, a cousin whose son was a close friend of  
the younger DiMaggio, said the Yale-educated man was unable to cope 
with his father's fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a brilliant mind. He was one of the intelligentsia,''  
Goodman said. ``He lived in the shadow of his father and could not 
rise above that. 
</P>
<P>
	``He marched to a different drummer. He was very sensitive to  
the people close to him,'' Goodman said. ``He really was not a bad 
boy. He was confused about a lot of issues in his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph DiMaggio Jr.'s middle name was Paul, the same as his  
father and uncles, Vince and Dominic, both of whom also played in 
the major leagues. Joe DiMaggio Sr. once explained, ``Saint Paul 
was my father's favorite saint.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Leak Cause of Texas Hotel Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) -- Investigators confirmed Saturday that a  
gas leak was to blame for a blast that ripped through a new hotel, 
seriously burning a man and injuring dozens with broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Marshal Dick Ward said natural gas lines that supplied the  
hotel's swimming pool heater caused the Friday evening explosion at 
the Embassy Suites Outdoor World. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas E. Marcer, a subcontractor who was working on the heater  
when the blast occurred, remained in serious condition Saturday at 
Parkland Hospital in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcer, interviewed by authorities Saturday in his hospital  
room, and another worker apparently didn't know there was gas in 
the line as they worked on it, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no negligence involved by either one of these  
technicians,'' the fire marshal said. ``They were doing their jobs 
properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ward said the gas was ignited either by an electrical pump or an  
ignitor system on the pool equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion blew through an exterior wall and a gift shop only  
three days after the hotel opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten people, including six children, were treated for minor  
injuries at nearby hospitals. About two dozen other people were 
treated by paramedics at the scene for cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the 330-unit hotel, located near Dallas-Fort  
Worth International Airport, might reopen early next week.

<HEADLINE> Retired Temple Coach Litwack Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Retired Temple University basketball coach  
Harry Litwack, whose 21-year reign included the 1969 NIT 
championship, died of a stroke at his home in Huntingdon Valley 
today. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Litwack, a cigar-smoking gentleman known as ``The Chief,'' had  
been battling a spinal disease for three years when he passed away, 
his wife, Estelle, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached the Owls from 1952 until his retirement in 1973.  
Litwack's reign included an 89-75 victory over Boston College for 
the 1969 NIT title, and he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of 
Fame in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Litwack also led the Owls to the NCAA Final Four in 1956 and  
1958, where the team finished third both times. 
</P>
<P>
	Litwack's 373-193 record also made him the second-winningest  
coach in Temple University, after being surpassed by current head 
coach John Chaney in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Litwack played at Temple in the late 1920s, where he captained  
the team twice in his three years on the varsity. Litwack was 
freshman team coach and assistant varsity coach for 20 years before 
taking over the Temple program in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basketball really was his life; he loved it,'' Mrs. Litwack  
said. ``He went right from high school on scholarship to Temple and 
stayed there until he retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his years as coach, Litwack soon became known ``The  
Chief'' because of the friendly manner in which he greeted people, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he used to drive a car, if he needed directions and saw a  
pedestrian walking by, he would say, 'Say, chief,''' she said. ``It 
was an expression he said so often when he needed information that 
people soon began calling him that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The name captured the polite gentleman that was Harry Litwack,  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his wife, Litwack is survived by two daughters, Lois  
Kieserman and Shelley Smoger, three grandsons and two great 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services are set for 1 p.m. Monday at Goldensteins'  
Rosenberg's Raphael-Sacks in Southampton.

<HEADLINE> Marlins Considering Ballpark Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Florida Marlins launched their campaign for a  
new ballpark Saturday by announcing six sites under consideration, 
and owner John Henry said he'll pay for the entire project himself 
if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry said the location chosen later this year will depend on  
which community most strongly supports a new stadium, which would 
cost an estimated $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry repeated an earlier pledge that he'll build a ballpark  
even if no tax money is forthcoming. But the expense of financing 
the project entirely with private money would mean a small player 
payroll for years to come and prevent the last-place Marlins from 
becoming competitive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that's what this community wants,'' Henry said.  
``It's up to the community to decide how much their share should 
be, rather than me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is for a baseball-only stadium with a retractable roof  
that would open in April 2003. The Marlins will consider four sites 
in Broward County and two in downtown Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broward sites are near Fort Lauderdale City Hall and in the  
suburbs of Lauderhill, Miramar and Davie. The Miami sites are near 
the Miami River and alongside Biscayne Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	In their current home at Pro Player Stadium, the Marlins project  
they'll lose $2.5 million this year despite a player payroll of 
just $19 million. Florida has the worst record in the major leagues 
and ranks ahead of only Montreal in National League attendance, 
averaging 18,144 fans per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about fielding a team which will represent the community  
competitively,'' Henry said. ``We are not a small market. The only 
thing which separates us from the kind of success Cleveland, 
Baltimore, Denver, Atlanta and Dallas have is a ballpark, not 
market size. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today these teams can afford salaries in excess of $60  
million. We cannot. At Pro Player Stadium we cannot afford a $20 
million payroll. A new home will enable the team to have payrolls 
comparable to the most successful franchises in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins said they're not ready to disclose how they would  
prefer to finance a new ballpark, but Henry said that with similar 
projects elsewhere, public money contributed an average of 80 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The multimillionaire commodities trader bought the team in  
January from founding owner Wayne Huizenga. He reiterated that he 
won't move the Marlins out of South Florida regardless of the 
public response to his appeal for support. 
</P>
<P>
	``Funding will require creativity and commitment, but I'm  
convinced we'll succeed,'' Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in both counties say they want any tax increase to be  
approved by voters, which could be difficult. A proposed 1-cent 
sales tax increase for transportation in Miami-Dade was defeated by 
a 2-1 margin last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlins officials believe there may be more willingness in  
Broward to help finance a ballpark. Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas 
is opposed to using public money to build stadiums.

<HEADLINE> SMU Faithful Rattled by Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- An investigation into possible minor NCAA rules  
violations would register barely a ripple at most schools. Not so 
at Southern Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
	The mere whiff of alleged impropriety is enough to rattle SMU  
faithful still recovering from the shame of the 1980s football 
scandal that earned the only NCAA death penalty ever imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	And so on Saturday -- the same day former Mustang Eric Dickerson  
was inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame -- those connected with the 
school struggled to digest news of an investigation into alleged 
irregularities involving an SMU defensive line coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an absolute shock,'' said Robert Folsom, an SMU booster  
and co-captain of the late 1940s Mustangs teams that included 
football greats Doak Walker and Kyle Rote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had been just absolutely annihilated, and we're coming out  
of the absolute pits and it's so hard to believe someone would do 
something like that knowing the problems we've had getting this 
program back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SMU athletic director Jim Copeland announced late Friday that  
the alleged problems, which date back three or four years, were 
uncovered about 2 1/2 weeks ago during a routine compliance check. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coach Steve Malin was suspended with pay, and the NCAA  
was notified this past week. Malin couldn't be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now they're just suspected violations and allegations,''  
Copeland said. ``But there was enough there to merit some type of 
suspension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from SMU described the issue as ``narrow in scope''  
and ``with no evidence of booster involvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Narrow or wide, the alleged wrongdoing had to make those who  
suffered through the late 1980s at SMU cringe. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only a dozen years ago that SMU, then an elite college  
program, was hit with the NCAA's harshest punishment after it was 
discovered that a banned booster paid 13 players thousands of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The pay-for-play scandal included a six-figure slush fund and  
involved Bill Clements, the once and future governor of Texas and a 
former chairman of the SMU Board of Governors. 
</P>
<P>
	SMU's reputation was tarred and the team was killed for two  
seasons. The Mustangs were reborn on Sept. 3, 1989 -- a decade ago 
next month -- as a 98-pound weakling that got clobbered in its first 
game by a lowly Rice team that had lost 18 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until 1997, under first-year coach Mike Cavan, that  
the Mustangs had another winning season, going 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavan did not return a call from The Associated Press on  
Saturday. He told The Dallas Morning News that the investigation 
will not affect preparation for the upcoming season. Freshman 
players report for practice starting Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that we're going to go through,'' Cavan said.  
``I'm just anxious for us to get in and get started, put this 
behind us and go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SMU trustee Cary Maguire on Saturday refused to discuss  
specifics of the Malin case, but said the school has ``zero 
tolerance for NCAA violations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I understood it to be just a very minor infraction and nothing  
to compare with the prior problems that the university had,'' 
Maguire said. ``The university has made a pretty strong effort to 
make people aware of the rules and the desire to comply with 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lonnie Kliever, a religious studies professor who led an  
internal investigation of the football program in the 1980s, also 
said it didn't appear the latest alleged problem was a major 
breach. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always the temptation to cut corners in  
intercollegiate athletics,'' Kliever said. ``I suppose, human 
nature being what it is, even SMU's past couldn't stop this from 
happening again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take some comfort in the fact that this seems to be an  
isolated incident in that it concerns one coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Kliever acknowledged, the incident can't help a  
reputation that was still healing. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the tag we're going to have to live with for a long,  
long time,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Caps Swimming With Three Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Too late.  
</P>
<P>
	Even with its best one-day gold medal haul of the Pan American  
Games, the United States swimming team wound up with its worst 
showing ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans finished strongly, getting golds from Denali Knapp  
in the women's 200-meter backstroke, from Timothy Siciliano in the 
men's 1,500 freestyle and from Tammie Spatz in the women's 50 
freestyle. Knapp swam a Pan Ams record 2 minutes, 12.48 seconds, 
Siciliano came through with a career-best 15:14.94, and Spatz sped 
to a best-ever 25.50. 
</P>
<P>
	In 32 events, the Americans won only 10 gold medals, three by  
men, seven by women. Not since 1963, when there were only eight 
events for men and eight for women, had either of the U.S. teams 
won fewer than 10 golds. 
</P>
<P>
	Never before had opposing swimmers combined to win more golds  
than the Americans. The previous high gold medal harvest for the 
non-Americans was 10 in 1995. This time, the total was 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's previous worst showing was six losses in 1995; this  
time, they lost 13 races. They didn't lose a single event in 1959 
or '63 (8-0), and went 15-0 in 1979. They had 14-1 records in 1971 
and 1975 and were 15-1 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	The women had been just as imposing in the past. This time, they  
were vulnerable, losing nine races, all to Canadians, in 16 events. 
The American women's previous high losses was six in 1971. Like the 
men, they also had unbeatable years, 8-0 in 1959 and 1963. Among 
their other overwhelming showings were 13-1 in 1975 and 1979 and 
12-2 in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Other noteworthy negatives this year included not getting anyone  
into the finals in two men's events for the first time, and failing 
to medal in three men's events, something that happened only twice 
previously. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't do quite as well as we wanted,'' men's coach Gregg  
Troy said, ``but we had a lot of young guys get experience. It took 
some great performances to beat us. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, the medals performance rated against the past was not  
good. If rated on what (athletes) we brought, it was one of the 
best performances ever. It bodes well for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``These type of kids will step up next year.''  
</P>
<P>
	Women's coach Pete Malone also was optimistic, pointing to gold  
medalists Kaitlin Sandeno, Staciana Stitts and Karen Campbell as 
stars of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've learned what international experience is all about,''  
he said. ``Sending the kids here means they will have a better 
Olympic journey next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids have gained a lot of valuable experience, along with  
the coach, who made some mistakes. They've gained experience so 
that when they go to Sydney they will be ready for the high octane 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here, the crowds were loud and hostile.''  
</P>
<P>
	The United States did get some satisfaction, topping the medals  
table with 37: 20 for women, 17 for men. Canada was second with 32, 
matching the U.S. women with 20 and getting 12 by the men. Canada, 
however, won the gold medal battle 13-10. Brazil finished third in 
overall medals with 15, including a men's high of seven golds. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada collected two golds Saturday night and Brazil got one.  
</P>
<P>
	Jessica Daglau became the first Canadian to win four golds at  
the Pan Am Games, taking the women's 200 butterfly with a meet and 
national record of 2:09.64. Deglau, 19, also won two silvers. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Curtis Myden, the 1996 Olympic bronze medalist in the  
200 individual medley, won his specialty at 2:02.38. Earlier, he 
won the 400 IM. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil capped the meet by winning the men's 400 medley relay  
with a Pan Ams record 3:40.27, as 200 freestyle champion Gustavo 
Borges outdueled American Scott Tucker in the final 100 freestyle 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Knapp, 21, of Davis, Calif., led a 1-2 U.S. finish in the  
women's backstroke. Beth Botsford, the 1996 Olympic 100 backstroke 
champion from Timonium, Md., finished second. 
</P>
<P>
	Siciliano, 19, from San Marcos, Calif., lowered his personal  
best by a remarkable seven seconds in cruising to a seven-second 
victory in the 1,500 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Siciliano got a reward for winning.  
</P>
<P>
	``My coach told me if I won the mile here, I wouldn't have to  
swim it at the national championships,'' the Michigan freshman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he will swim the 400 IM and the 400 freestyle at  
nationals, now being held at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Spatz, 23, a 1998 graduate from Texas, will have something even  
bigger to celebrate next Saturday than her Pan Ams victory; that's 
when she'll get married. 
</P>
<P>
	Spatz's victory was especially remarkable because when she was  
5, she was bedridden for a year with dermatomyocytis, a rare skin 
muscle and joint disease. 
</P>
<P>
	She began swimming at 9, and last year she thought about giving  
up the sport. Then, she was selected to the Pan Ams team and 
decided to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I'll stay with the sport for a while now,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Boggs Homers for 3,000th Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Wade Boggs became the first player  
to homer for his 3,000th hit, kissing home plate tonight to cap an 
amazing three-day run of baseball milestones. 
</P>
<P>
	One day after Tony Gwynn got his 3,000th hit and two days after  
Mark McGwire hit his 500th home run, Boggs reached his lifelong 
individual goal. 
</P>
<P>
	And Boggs, who rode a police horse around Yankee Stadium after  
winning his only World Series championship in 1996, celebrated with 
an emotional trip around the bases after becoming the 23rd player 
to reach 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs already had a pair of RBI singles for the Tampa Bay Devil  
Rays when he lined a hanging, 2-2 breaking ball from Cleveland's 
Chris Haney over the right-field wall in the sixth inning for a 
two-run, 372-foot homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs pointed upwards in a tribute to his mother, killed in a  
1986 car accident, as he approached second base. 
</P>
<P>
	A few steps from home, Boggs again pointed up. He then got down  
on his knees and kissed the plate as his teammates and family 
waited to embrace him. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs' father, Win, his wife, Debbie, and his 12-year-old son,  
Brett, came on the field to join the festivities. Brett, whose 
godfather is fellow 3,000-hit club member George Brett, was the 
Devil Rays' batboy. 
</P>
<P>
	Fireworks were set off when Boggs connected, and a scramble  
developed for the historic ball. Several fans ran onto the field, 
but security guards stopped them from reaching Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball was caught in the stands by Mike Hogan, 32, of Tampa,  
who planned to give it back to Boggs. Fans were presented with a 
commemorative postcard when the game resumed after a four-minute 
delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs, 41, is a five-time AL batting champion. He grew up about  
20 miles from Tropicana Field and played Little League ball in 
Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs, best known for spraying line drives to the opposite  
field, reached 3,000 by pulling a rare home run. This was just his 
second of the season and 118th of his career, which began in 1982 
with Boston and later took him to the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the sixth time that two players have gotten their  
3,000th hit in the same season. It last happened in 1992 when Brett 
and Robin Yount did it. 
</P>
<P>
	The others were: Honus Wagner and Nap Lajoie in 1914, Tris  
Speaker and Eddie Collins in 1925, Hank Aaron and Willie Mays in 
1970 and Lou Brock and Carl Yastrzemski in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken could become the third player to reach 3,000 this  
year. The Baltimore star, currently on the disabled list, needs 32 
more hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, an eight-time NL batting champion who also made his major  
league debut in 1982, had said he wanted to beat Boggs to 3,000. 
The 39-year-old San Diego star did it Friday night at Montreal with 
a first-inning single, and went on to get three more hits. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire became the 16th player to reach the 500-homer mark  
Thursday at St. Louis. Like Gwynn, the Cardinals slugger kept going 
after making history, later connecting for No. 501 in the same 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Stung by criticism after he acknowledged he wanted to reach the  
milestone at home in front of his father, Boggs moved within three 
of the plateau with a hit at Seattle on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	He sat out the last four innings of that game because of slight

before opening a six-game homestand Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 0-for-3 against Dave Burba in the series opener and  
grounded out in his first at-bat against longtime nemesis Charles 
Nagy on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays loaded the bases for Boggs with two singles and a  
walk in the third. The 12-time All-Star was just 11-for-54 against 
Nagy going into the game, but grounded a 1-0 pitch to right for his 
2,998th hit to drive in Tampa Bay's first run. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2,999 found the same hole between first and second base,  
just beyond the reach of a diving Roberto Alomar. The crowd gave 
Boggs a standing ovation and the hometown hero acknowledged the 
applause with a wave.

<P>
	He walked in his final plate appearance in the eighth.

<HEADLINE> Beef Might Be Labeled by Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shoppers can tell if their shoes or shirts are  
made in America. They may know soon if their steak is, too, should 
producers and food retailers settle on a voluntary program for 
promoting U.S. beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle producers, who want to curb cattle imports from Canada,  
have been stymied so far in getting Congress to require beef to be 
labeled with the country of origin. 
</P>
<P>
	But now the National Cattlemen's Beef Association and the Food  
Marketing Institute, the trade group for the nation's supermarkets, 
are discussing a system for identifying U.S.-grown beef in stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be meeting our goal, which is clearly identifying  
U.S. product in the meat case,'' said Dale Moore, legislative 
director for the cattlemen's group. 
</P>
<P>
	For the retailers, a voluntary system aimed at promoting U.S.  
products rather than stigmatizing imports would get around their 
longstanding objections to being told by the government what to put 
on food labels, and to identifying foreign products. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the issue is that we want our consumers to be aware of  
product that is grown, made, produced in the U.S., then we want to 
cooperate with our producers to promote those products,'' said 
Karen Brown, senior vice president of the supermarket group. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether U.S. beef would be labeled as such or simply identified  
by a sign at the meat case has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Other issues are unresolved: Should Mexican cattle brought into  
the United States as calves be considered U.S. or Mexican: What 
should be the identify of ground beef that often is a mix between 
U.S. meat and meat imported from Australia or New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, the Senate approved legislation that would have  
required meat to be labeled as imported, domestic or a blend. But 
meatpackers, who claim that labeling meat could cost the industry 
$1 billion a year, got the measure killed before it became law. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Department officials warned at the time that the  
labeling requirement would cost the government $60 million a year 
to enforce and could backfire on producers if foreign countries 
retaliated against U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, however, cattle producers worked out a compromise  
with packers on another thorny issue -- requiring packers to report 
the prices they pay for livestock. That gives producers hope a deal 
can be struck on meat labeling as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the meatpackers would have to go along; otherwise,  
retailers would have no way of knowing the meat they are selling is 
American. So far, packers are showing little interest, citing the 
cost and trouble of identifying where meat originates. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has identified any benefits associated with it,'' said  
Jens Knudson, staff economist for the American Meat Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	But one supermarket chain, Iowa-based Hy-Vee Inc., already has a  
program for promoting U.S.-grown beef and produce that dramatically 
has increased sales of both, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement with Montfort Inc., one of the nation's  
biggest packers, Hy-Vee sells a Blue Ribbon line of beef that comes 
from cattle raised in the upper Midwest, its marketing area. 
Through similar deals with produce suppliers, Hy-Vee identifies the 
region of the country where fruits and vegetables are grown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's celebrate the best that American agriculture has to  
offer, and consumers will surely respond,'' Hy-Vee executive Ray 
Stewart told a congressional committee. ``We don't need laws to do 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department, asked by Congress to study the  
impact of a mandatory labeling law, says in a draft report there is 
no evidence to suggest it would increase producer income. About 10 
percent of the beef that Americans consume is imported. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers say they will move ahead with plans to encourage  
retailers and packers to agree on a voluntary system. ``I don't 
know if a voluntary agreement will lead to an end, but I know it 
won't lead to a strong enough approach if we don't continue to push 
mandatory legislation,'' said Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Gives Gore Campaign Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore may be concerned about  
being perceived as too close to a president who was impeached, but 
that is not stopping him from using Bill Clinton's fund-raising 
prowess to boost his White House hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was speaking Saturday night at a fund-raiser for  
the Gore 2000 presidential campaign committee, the first of a 
series of such events featuring Clinton. The president also will 
attend four fund-raisers in the nation's capital, two next week and 
two on Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's dinner at the State House Convention Center was  
expected to draw 500 of Arkansas' most influential Democrats, with 
each asked to contribute at least $500. Other scheduled speakers 
included Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark.; U.S. Transportation 
Secretary Rodney Slater and Arkansas Attorney General Mark Pryor. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, Gore has told associates he had felt the drag of  
Clinton's impeachment on attempts to get his own campaign in gear 
during the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign officials said last week they were confident the  
public was well past any unease about Clinton and his personal 
behavior. But it was clear Saturday that public pairings of Clinton 
and Gore were planned carefully planned so the politicians would 
not come across as a team. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president arrived in Little Rock separately from  
Clinton, flying in from Chicago where he was speaking to a meeting 
of the Rainbow Coalition. Clinton and Gore were appearing together 
for a private meeting with farmers and African-American ministers 
before the fund-raising dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign has stressed that the president plays no  
hands-on role in stump strategy -- even as the campaign takes 
advantage of Clinton's ability to invigorate Democrats in the face 
of a primary challenge from Sen. Bill Bradley, and the possibility 
of a tough race against the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Clinton strategist Paul Begala, who is supporting Gore  
from the sidelines, said Gore only stands to benefit from having 
Clinton in his corner, in terms of fund raising and putting the 
full force of presidential power behind Gore's policy ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This slavish devotion to Bush's lead in the polls is breeding  
a surrenderist strategy among a few faint-hearted Democrats,'' 
Begala said. ``I don't think people are going to say, 'Clinton 
cheated on his wife, so let's go back to Reaganomics and give more 
tax cuts to the rich.' And that's exactly what the other side, the 
Republicans would do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore and Clinton were teaming up again on the campaign  
trail, the Bradley team watched from the sidelines with little 
noticeable interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``All presidential elections are about the future and people are  
going to make a judgment of who they want for the future, not so 
much a calculation about the past,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric 
Hauser.

<HEADLINE> Teen Leads U.S. Swimming Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- There's no question that Kaitlin  
Sandeno is a leader, even at the tender age of 16. 
</P>
<P>
	She's been the president of her freshman and sophomore classes  
at El Toro (Calif.) High School and will be the president of her 
junior class in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	She's also been the leader of the U.S. swim team at the Pan  
American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the swimmers have been sinking faster than a lead  
balloon at these games, the precocious Sandeno, a former standout 
soccer player, has stayed afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was an awesome feeling,'' she said Friday night, after  
becoming the first U.S. swimmer to win two individual gold medals 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Also grabbing gold Friday was Gerald Tucker, 20, of Cincinnati,  
who easily won the bantamweight title, outpointing Neouar Cermeno 
of Venezuela 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt this is my biggest win ever,'' he said. ``I'll never  
forget this, not for the rest of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans won the other five bouts, with middleweight Arthur  
Palac of Hamtramck, Mich., losing to Yohason Martinez in the 
middleweight division. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men's basketball team moved into the final against  
Brazil by defeating Argentina 84-76. Brazil took Puerto Rico 95-85. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Williams scored 19 points to lead the Americans, who will  
try to give the United States it first Pan Ams championship since 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is why you come,'' U.S. coach Mo McHone said. ``I think  
our guys are focused, we've had great practices and we've really 
had a great effort. I feel like we're where we want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So was Lea Foreman, of Denmark, Wis., who lifted 474 pounds to  
take the 152-pound class. It was the third U.S. gold in the games 
for a woman weightlifter; Robin Byrd Goad earlier won the 117-pound 
class. Tara Nott won in 105.6 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The American men won bronze in soccer by beating Canada 2-1.  
Carlos Bocanegra drove in a header off a cross from Cory Gibbs in 
the seventh minute. Then 17-year-old forward Landon Donovan of 
Bayer Leverkusen in Germany added a second off a rebound in the 
60th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed the ``Energizer,'' Sandeno provided a spark for the  
floundering Americans, leading all the way en route to winning the 
women's 800-meter freestyle with a Pan Ams record of 8 minutes, 
34.65 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something I didn't expect,'' Sandeno said of her  
victories in the 400 and 800 freestyles in her first major 
international competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandeno won't have any time to savor her success. Today, she  
left for the U.S. Swimming Championships at Minneapolis. A 
versatile swimmer -- she was the 400 individual medley champion at 
this year's spring nationals -- Sandeno still is undecided in which 
events she will compete at nationals. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's 400 medley relay of Denali Knapp, Staciana Stitts,  
Karen Campbell and Tammie Spatz gave the Americans another gold, 
winning with a games record 4:06.08. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite those victories, the U.S. team has won only seven of 26  
events, its worst showing ever at the Pan Ams. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans led the way today in four of the five preliminaries  
for tonight's finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Spatz, coming back off her strong leg in the winning relay, went  
25.67 in the 50 freestyle, with teammate Shannon Hosack fourth at 
26.22. Beth Botsford, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist in the women's 
100 backstroke, had the fastest qualifying time in the 200 
backstroke prelims, with 2:15.15. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Montague was more than two seconds faster than anyone  
else in the prelims of the men's 200 individual medley, clocking a 
career-best 2:02.99, and the men's 400 medley relay team of Justin 
Ewers, Jarrod Marrs, Adam Messner and Dan Phillips led the way into 
the final with a qualifying time of 3:45.34. 
</P>
<P>
	Two others swimmers joined Sandeno as double individual gold  
medalists Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Joanne Malar earned her 15th Pan Ams medal in three  
Games, winning the women's 200 individual medley in 2:14.18, 
breaking the meet record of 2:14.81 she set in the preliminaries. 
Earlier, she won the 400 IM. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's Fernando Scherer, the men's 100 freestyle champion, won  
the 50 freestyle at 22.24, after setting the games record of 22.22 
in the prelims. The victory gave Brazil a sweep of all four men's 
freestyle titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The other swimming winners were Canada's Shamek Pietucha in the  
men's 200 butterfly at 1:59.10 and Cuba's Rodolfo Cabrera in the 
men's backstroke at 54.93.

<HEADLINE> Piatkowski Signs With Clippers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For Eric Piatkowski, life with the Clippers for $3 million per  
year was better than the alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year veteran took the most lucrative deal he could find  
Friday and stemmed the tide of players abandoning the Clippers, 
becoming the first of Los Angeles' many free agents to re-sign with 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look around the league, everyone can see there's no money  
out there,' he said. ``This is the best deal. I thought about it a 
lot, it was a hard decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only three free agents signed deals Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	John Wallace, who entered the NBA with the Knicks in 1996 before  
being traded to Toronto, rejoined New York for three years and $6.6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaren Jackson, a key component in the Spurs' push to the NBA  
title last season, decided to stay in San Antonio for a three-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first five days of the NBA's trading and signing period,  
the Clippers lost Rodney Rogers and Darrick Martin on the open 
market and worked out a sign-and-trade deal sending Lamond Murray 
to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles also could lose Lorenzen Wright, who is reportedly  
close to signing a one-year, $2 million contract with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea what he's going to do,'' Clippers vice  
president Elgin Baylor said. ``I know we're still talking with him, 
it's not a dead issue as far as we're concerned. We would like to 
keep him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sherman Douglas and Tyrone Nesby are the Clippers' other two  
free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the best remaining unsigned free agent is Mitch  
Richmond, who is holding out hope he can somehow be traded to 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	With Seattle, Golden State and Sacramento out of the Richmond  
sweepstakes, Miami was believed to be the only team still trying to 
make a sign-and-trade deal with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, however, was that a third team -- Toronto, Chicago  
or the Los Angeles Clippers -- was needed to facilitate a Richmond 
trade under the NBA's salary cap rules. And with the Heat unwilling 
to part with P.J. Brown, it was looking less likely that Richmond 
would be moving on to Miami, his destination of choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still give it some hope, but all these deals are very hard  
to do,'' Richmond's agent, Mike Sharpe, said. ``It's a tough 
situation, but we haven't stopped trying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, meanwhile, left everyone wondering why he might sign  
with the Lakers for $2 million when his old team, the Clippers, had 
offered him $30 million for six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five million (per season) was put on the table,'' Baylor, the  
Clippers vice president of basketball operations, told the Long 
Beach Press-Telegram. ``He (agent Robert Fayne) didn't find that 
acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fayne and Wright were reportedly meeting with Lakers executives  
Friday, although the team refused to confirm it. 
</P>
<P>
	The news that Wright might sign with the Lakers came as somewhat  
of a shock to Indiana, Minnesota and Atlanta, all of which had 
tried to obtain the forward-center in a sign-and-trade deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Press-Telegram said the Pacers offered Travis Best and  
Austin Croshere, while the Timberwolves offered Anthony Peeler and 
Dean Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks, who backed off a proposed Jim Jackson-Wright trade  
earlier this week, were believed to have discussed a different 
offer with the Clippers in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	Fayne did not return numerous phone messages.  
</P>
<P>
	Richmond, offered $30 million over three seasons by the Wizards,  
would accept less money if it would get him traded to the Heat, his 
agent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Golden State had been interested in Richmond, but the Warriors  
could only pay him less than half of what Washington has offered. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle also tried to get Richmond and would have paid him more  
than Golden State could, but Wizards general manager Wes Unseld 
turned down the Sonics' sign-and-trade proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economic package has to be weighed against everything  
else, and Mitch has said that if he can't get the right economic 
package he wants to go someplace where the team will be 
competitive,'' Sharpe said. ``We haven't given up yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, who had been included in recent three-way trade talks  
involving Miami, Washington and Toronto, decided to sign with the 
Knicks under the middle-class exception. He spent his first NBA 
season with the Knicks and was a fan favorite before being traded 
to Toronto in the Chris Dudley deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we traded John, it was a necessary evil,'' coach Jeff Van  
Gundy said. ``The only way we could get Dudley was to part with a 
quality player, so we made that trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson averaged 6.4 points and 2.1 rebounds during the Spurs'  
NBA championship season, the best year of his nine-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	He had several key moments during the Spurs' playoff run. He led  
the team in 3-pointers (31 in 17 games), and averaged 8.2 points 
per game in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Piatkowski, 28, averaged 10.5 points and 2.9 rebounds last  
season, becoming the Clippers' all-time leader in 3-point shots 
attempted and made.

<HEADLINE> Gov't 'Print and Delete' Policy OKd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agencies may purge records from  
computers once copies of the original documents are made, an 
appellate court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision Friday was the first major setback for the advocacy  
group Public Citizen in a records-preservation battle that began a 
decade ago with an effort to keep the White House from destroying 
records of the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  
District of Columbia Circuit overturned a lower court's ban on 
destruction of records. 
</P>
<P>
	Public Citizen sued John Carlin, archivist of the United States,  
and executive branch agencies in 1996 over Carlin's ruling the year 
before authorizing federal agencies to ``print and delete'' from 
government computers electronic mail or word processing records. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlin's position makes such orders applicable to all federal  
agencies. His order allowed paper, microfilm or electronic 
retrieval copying. 
</P>
<P>
	Public Citizen, with the American Library Association, the  
American Historical Association, the Organization of American 
Historians and other research groups, sued on grounds Carlin's 
order violated the U.S. Records Disposal Act and was ``arbitrary 
and capricious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court, in a decision written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg,  
ruled that the order did not violate the act, which gave Carlin 
wide discretion to set standards and methods for destroying 
documents. Judges Laurence Silberman and Stephen Williams joined in 
the opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, the court said, the plaintiffs did not question  
Carlin's right to order destruction of reproduced original computer 
records but argued that Carlin erred in not requiring electronic 
storage. Such retrieval systems are much easier for researchers and 
others to use than other forms of storage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus, therefore, is upon whether the archivist acted  
arbitrarily and capriciously in determining that a paper copy in a 
paper record-keeping system is an adequate substitute for the 
electronic original,'' the judges wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	They ruled that, although Carlin wrote in issuing his order of  
the benefits of electronic over paper record-keeping, his failure 
to order it was neither arbitrary nor capricious. 
</P>
<P>
	They quoted Carlin's reasoning in a document that accompanied  
the original order: 
</P>
<P>
	``Electronic record-keeping systems may be the best means to  
preserve the content, structure and context of electronic records. 
In addition, an automated system may be more easily searched and 
manipulated than paper records,'' Carlin wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he wrote, ``agencies must create and maintain records to  
conduct government business and account for their activities. Only 
the agency can determine what format best serves these purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public Citizen first challenged the routine destruction of  
electronic records in 1989. A court ordered the government not to 
push ahead with destruction of Iran-Contra e-mail and word 
processing files from the computers of Oliver North and other 
National Security Council officials. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the NSC's ``print and destroy'' policy that Carlin's 1995  
order sent throughout the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The appellate panel's ruling overturned a decision two years ago  
by U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman in which he voided Carlin's 
order and instructed him to come up with a permanent plan for 
handling electronic documents by last September. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Friedman's ruling, agencies have backed away from ``print  
and destroy,'' Michael Tankersley, Public Citizen's lead attorney 
in the Carlin case, wrote in paper posted on the group's Web site 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Department of Defense, one of the government's largest  
generators of computer records, has announced detailed plans to 
preserve and manage its electronic records in electronic format,'' 
Tankersley wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Other agencies also are guarding against premature destruction  
of electronic records, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	It was uncertain whether Public Citizen would appeal the loss.  
Tankersley did not immediately return a telephone call Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	His colleague in the case, Alan Morrison, told The Washington  
Post that a decision on a higher appeal had not been made.

	SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) -- Francesco Casagrande of Italy today  
won his second consecutive San Sebastian Classic, a World Cup 
cycling event. 
</P>
<P>
	A flat tire knocked out Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong.  
</P>
<P>
	The American dropped quit about 25 miles from the finish, after  
getting a puncture as he approached the traditionally decisive

<P>
	And, it was on the Jaizkibel pass that Casagrande opened up his  
lead, crossing the finishing line 43 seconds ahead of the pack of 
25 riders. Rik Verbrougghe of Belgium finished second, followed by

<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- It wasn't Mexico. It wasn't the  
Confederations Cup. It was another bronze medal. For the United 
States, that's major progress. 
</P>
<P>
	With a goal in each half, the United States overcame a driving  
rain, gusting wind, a hostile crowd and Canada to win 2-1 Friday 
night and take third place at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``With our youngsters, U.S. soccer has never been in as good  
shape as it is right now,'' U.S. coach Clive Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Bocanegra drove in a header off a cross from Cory Gibbs  
in the seventh minute. Then 17-year-old forward Landon Donovan of 
Bayer Leverkusen in Germany added a second off a rebound in the 
60th minute to give the United States only its third men's soccer 
medal in Pan American play. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming here with an amalgamated squad of under-17, under-20 and  
under-23 players, the United States admitted before the tournament 
began it came to Winnipeg to test prospects for the Olympic 
qualifying run next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The players had other ideas. They wanted a medal.  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't even know,'' Donovan said, unable to quantify the  
desire to get a medal despite the little hope observers gave them. 
``I'm just happy we won the game. That's all I care about. It's all 
about that bronze medal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys are going nuts,'' Charles said. ``They're very  
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bronze medal came only three days after the United States'  
senior team beat Saudi Arabia 2-0 in Mexico City to take third 
place at the Confederations Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Bocanegra's header from the 6-yard line came amid intermittent  
rain. But then the skies opened up with heavy rain and strong 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a capacity crowd of about 8,000, Canada rarely  
threatened until the final 10 minutes. Chris Pozniak gave the host 
nation hope, launching a right-footer from just outside the arc 
past the outstretched arm of goalkeeper Tim Howard and into the 
upper right corner of the net in the 85th. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got up a goal early and we didn't play very well,''  
Canada coach Bruce Twamley said. ``They deserved it.''

<HEADLINE> Weightlifter Carrying U.S. Flag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- It was a big day for weightlifter Wes  
Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, of St. Joseph, Mo., won a bronze medal, his third Pan  
American Games medal, on Saturday. And he was selected the flag 
bearer for the U.S. team at the closing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, 29, earned the bronze medal in the 105-kilogram  
division after winning a gold medal in the 1995 Pan Ams. He added 
another bronze by lifting 380 kilos (838 pounds) this year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1991 games, Barnett was a last-minute addition to the  
team and captured the silver medal. He is the only member of the 
U.S. weightlifting team competing in his third Pan Ams. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett is a six-time national champion, two-time Olympian,  
two-time world championships medalist and currently holds two 
American records. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as impressive as his athletic accomplishments are the  
challenges he has faced. Barnett has learned to live with treatment 
for a cancerous tumor found in his eye in 1998. He also attempts to 
overcome the stereotype of drug use in his sport by speaking to 
youth groups to emphasize drug-free training. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's flag bearer was chosen by the captains of the various  
U.S. sports. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HOT TIME IN THE POOL:* A small fire in a basement lounge  
delayed the start of the swimming preliminaries Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alarm warnings were sounded just before the start of the  
scheduled competition and the pool building was evacuated. A few 
minutes later, everyone was allowed to return and the program began 
15 minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SUPER SWORDSMEN:* Not everything involving Cuba in these games  
is political. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. fencers saluted the Cubans after losing to them in the  
finals of the men's team foil. American Cliff Bayer said the Cubans 
are an inspiration because of the way they train and compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of training sessions with them,'' Bayer said.  
``They're role models. They're role models for me, they're role 
models for the rest of the national team. They train nonstop with 
heart and soul and they're the people that we should try to 
imitate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because they're people that fence with their technique and  
most importantly, they fence with their heart and that's what gets 
the win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba beat the U.S. men without its top competitor, Elvis Gil  
Gregory, who's ranked No. 3 in the world. Gregory injured a knee 
while winning the individual foils earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're truly great sports people,'' said George  
Kolombatovich, the U.S. team leader. ``They're tough competitively. 
They're respected throughout the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CAR COLLECTION:* When Brazil's Bernardo Alves gets ready to  
drive to the equestrian ring, he has to make a tough decision: 
Which car does he take? 
</P>
<P>
	Cars are awarded as prizes for championships in Brazil. With  
victory after victory in the show ring, Alves, 24, has amassed a 
collection of 18 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now he's a car dealer,'' teammate Andre Johannpeter said.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FOREIGN AID:* Swimmer Melissa Mata's participation in the  
200-meter butterfly on Saturday had been in doubt -- until volunteer 
Joan Mayhew stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
	Mata, Costa Rica's only female swimmer in the games, had her  
sports bag stolen at the athletes village. Mayhew learned of the 
theft Friday while driving Mata to the dentist, so she began 
working the phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours, local businesses had outfitted Mata with a new  
swimsuit, goggles, a cap, a sports bag, a wind suit and a 
sweatsuit. Mayhew also gave Mata $100 ($67 U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
	Mata finished fifth in her heat and did not qualify for the  
finals. But at least she got to swim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really proud to have these kinds of volunteers working for  
me,'' said Brad Sciback, Mayhew's supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FAMILY AFFAIR:* It should come as no surprise that the Sebelen  
family makes up three-fourths of the Dominican Republic's bowling 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	As the owners of the only bowling center in their country, the  
Sebelens -- father Rolando and sons Rolly and Rolando Antonio -- get 
a lot of free practice time. 
</P>
<P>
	Papa Sebelen, 59, is a former world champion and has rolled four  
300 games in his career. Rolando Antonio, 31, also has four perfect 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very competitive athlete,'' Rolly, 35, said of his  
father. ``He pushes us because he always does his best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth family member, 25-year-old Rolando Rafael, will join  
the others at the world championships in the United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
	``God gave me a chance to bowl with my boys,'' Papa said. ``We  
have to make the most of these chances.''

<HEADLINE> New Orleans Schools Call in Marine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- To fix schools where paint peels off  
classroom walls like snakeskin, where teachers bring their own 
toilet paper and where test scores are lower than the surrounding 
swamps, New Orleans has called in the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, just one Marine -- Alphonse Davis, 48, a slender,  
bespectacled former colonel who left his job as a Pentagon division 
chief for a $150,000-a-year job in his home town. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he's never been a schoolteacher and has no education  
degrees, the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education had 
to rewrite the rules for superintendents. It decreed Davis a CEO 
rather than a superintendent and told him he had to hire a No. 2 
with a background in education, by late October. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some call me superintendent, some call me colonel. To me, it  
doesn't matter,'' Davis says. He notes he's taught young Marines -- 
he ran the Officer Candidates School from 1995-97 -- and says his 
New Orleans job is to harness everyone's knowledge and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm grateful for nay-sayers. It proves to me that people are  
interested and excited about education,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' task is to rescue a school system many parents have  
already abandoned -- unless they have kids in one of the few magnet 
schools or can't afford to send them to private or parochial 
school. More than a fifth of the city's 106,000 students are in 
private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Make no mistake -- ours is a system in crisis,'' he told his  
new troops in his first communique last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis wears mufti these days, but his shoes still sport a high  
military gloss from his 26 years in the Marines and he still spouts 
the odd bit of mil-bizspeak. He won't appoint committees to find 
ways to improve schools, for instance -- he'll have Tiger Teams, 
``fast-strike'' crews that aim to get answers fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Terence Bradford, whose daughter just graduated from a New  
Orleans high school and has one son in high school and another in 
fourth grade, says he's impressed with what he's read about Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very optimistic. I think he's going to do a great job,''  
he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Any way you look at New Orleans' school system, it's a mess.  
</P>
<P>
	A few magnet schools are successful, but systemwide scores are  
abysmal. 
</P>
<P>
	One principal defended his students' standardized test scores by  
noting they were above the city average. Yet the city average was 
at the 26th percentile, which means it was lower than 74 percent of 
all U.S. students who took the test. 
</P>
<P>
	Statewide norms this spring were at the 44th or 45th percentile,  
depending on grade level. Orleans Parish norms were at the 23rd to 
25th percentile. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the successful schools aren't exempt from turmoil. Academic  
magnet schools are rewriting admissions policies because of 
allegations they discriminated against blacks. Supporters of the 
newly renovated arts magnet school want the state to take it over 
because they fear the cash-strapped city might not be able to keep 
it up. 
</P>
<P>
	The last superintendent, Morris Holmes, hired from Fort Worth,  
Texas, in 1993 as the system's savior, was bought out in 1997, just 
months after signing his second contract, because of a series of 
controversies that brought further scorn on the district. 
</P>
<P>
	They included reports that test scores might have been inflated,  
forfeiture of an $800,000 state grant because student expulsions 
were misreported and revelations that the district over five years 
had lost $3.4 million in property -- including computer monitors, 
sewing machines, a photocopier, automotive shop equipment, 10 air 
conditioners, three pianos and 450 bank instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a federal jury last year found that the Orleans  
Parish School Board had deliberately overcharged the U.S. 
Department of Education by $7.6 million in insurance costs over 11 
years, including Holmes' entire stint as superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	On his first day on the job last month, Davis announced a  
100-day plan that includes Tiger Teams for reading, summer school, 
the discipline and dress code, and the state tests that decide 
whether students get promoted. The teams must have final reports in 
by Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for students to write regular essays about books  
he chooses. It also proposes a ``Word of the Month'' program that 
involves essays and discussions about ``values-based'' words such 
as ``respect'' or ``discipline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's also proposed neighborhood homework centers staffed by  
volunteer college students and residents. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he'll get rid of people who aren't committed to change,  
even if they have contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Change is not going to happen overnight,'' warns Davis, an  
admitted sloganeer. ``Change and progress are evolutionary, not 
revolutionary.''

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Facing Rapid AIDS Spread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Saroeun Thuong's eyes search the  
faces of strangers for any sign of compassion, trying to make her 
pleas for help heard over the traffic on dusty Monivong Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
	Squatting in the only patch of shade outside an orphanage in  
Cambodia's capital, she cradles her daughter, a sickly 7-month-old 
probably ill with AIDS. ``I have not named her yet because she is 
so sick,'' Thuong says. 
</P>
<P>
	Thuong has come to abandon her baby. The agony of the decision  
is etched deeply in her sunburned face. Tears fill her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	She has made her way to the orphanage, the Phnom Penh Nutrition  
Center, from a village 25 miles east of Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
	A nurse spots Thuong before she can leave the child.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was told that I could hand over my baby to the doctors here.  
I don't have any money to feed my baby and my other child,'' Thuong 
tells her. 
</P>
<P>
	The nurse listens patiently, but then tells the 32-year-old  
mother to leave. The child is too ill for the orphanage to accept, 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Quietly Thuong gathers herself and the baby and disappears down  
a side street. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic elections a year ago gave many Cambodians hope for  
better times after a long civil war that left their nation one of 
the world's poorest. But a new kind of death is spreading. 
</P>
<P>
	Cambodia is suffering the highest rate of infection with the  
AIDS virus in Asia. The first case of HIV infection was detected in 
1991, and now the virus is infecting an estimated 100 people a day. 
Prime Minister Hun Sen says more than 8,000 Cambodians died of AIDS 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cambodia's thriving commercial sex industry is seen as the main  
culprit in the spread of the disease. It is believed half the 
10,000 to 20,000 sex workers are infected with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the saddest cases are the infants. The authorities say  
more and more HIV-positive babies are being abandoned at orphanages 
and hospitals in Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the next year as many as 1,700 Cambodian children will  
die from the virus,'' says Dr. Tia Phalla, the Ministry of Health's 
national manager for its AIDS program. 
</P>
<P>
	He says the number of orphans under age 15 infected with the  
virus is expected to reach more than 12,000 next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lying in a simple wooden crib in a nursery at the Phnom Penh  
Nutrition Center, 6-month-old Roath Chamrouen stares blankly at the 
ceiling. Any movement near the crib causes him to cry out. The 
cries are silent; he is too weak to make any noise. 
</P>
<P>
	Ly Da, a nurse, quietly slips on a pair of rubber gloves before  
changing the boy's diaper. ``Every month we get more and more 
babies like this,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 40 to 50 AIDS children at the aging orphanage.  
Infants, toddlers and young teens are tended lovingly by nurses and 
volunteers. Small mountains of freshly laundered cloth diapers 
compete for space along with toys and strollers. 
</P>
<P>
	Da gently changes the diaper of Roath Chamrouen, smiles and puts  
him back in the crib. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pity because they are born from parents with AIDS, but  
I love these children as my own,'' she says.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Reactor Heads for Burial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAINIER, Ore. (AP) -- Entombed in concrete and 6-inch steel, the  
radioactive reactor of the largest U.S. nuclear power plant ever to 
be shut down was loaded onto a barge Friday and began a 270-mile 
river journey skirting the northern edge of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time a commercial reactor of this size -- and  
level of contamination -- will pass so near a major American city, 
according to officials at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the 
agency overseeing the decommissioning of the Trojan Nuclear Plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the utility that owns the reactor, which is headed for  
burial 45 feet deep on the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in 
Washington, considered the river journey risky, and 
environmentalists were worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying if the reactor falls off into the water,  
everybody would have to be evacuated from Portland, but it would 
not be good for the Columbia River to have a reactor vessel sitting 
in it,'' said Lloyd Marbet, who led three unsuccessful ballot 
initiatives to have the plant shut down. ``The fact of the matter 
is that the interior of the vessel contains a very high level of 
radioactivity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moving the 1,000-ton reactor is contentious because  
environmentalists had urged the plant's owner, Portland General 
Electric, to mothball the entire site for at least 50 years and 
wait for the radioactive isotopes to cool down before dismantling 
the facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, PGE opted to barge the reactor vessel from its current  
site, 42 miles northwest of Portland on the banks of the Columbia 
River, to the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. Before moving the 
towering, dumbbell-shaped object, it was shrink-wrapped in blue 
plastic and plastered with a sign reading ``Radioactive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chugging along no faster than 12 mph, a tug was to take the  
barge past Portland by early Saturday and continue upstream until 
it reaches the Port of Benton dock near Hanford sometime Sunday. 
From there, two trucks creeping along at 5 mph will pull the vessel 
on a 320-wheel, 16-axle trailer to Hanford, 15 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Utility officials say barging the leakproof reactor is the  
safest way to decommission the plant, which for 16 years generated 
enough electricity to power all of Portland. It was closed in 1993, 
two decades earlier than planned, after a series of problems, 
including a faulty safety system that drew federal fines, the 
accidental release of radioactive gases and cracked steam tubes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would characterize it as a risky move, but it's a lot safer  
than the traditional method of cutting the reactor into pieces and 
trucking it over the highway,'' PGE spokesman Kregg Arntson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, a train hauled away the reactor vessel of the Yankee  
Rowe nuclear plant in Massachusetts, but unlike Trojan, it weighed 
only 360 tons and was not transported through heavily populated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland General Electric already has shipped off Trojan's  
contaminated steam generators in five trips to Hanford since 1995, 
and the Navy has long shipped old reactors from submarines and 
cruisers up the Columbia for burial at the site -- all without any 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The only difference is that the Trojan reactor contains 15 times  
as much radioactivity as those objects, according to state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Arntson said the vessel poses little risk to the workers  
handling it or residents living along the river, once it is encased 
in concrete. A person standing within six feet of the reactor for 
an hour would receive no more radiation than an airplane passenger 
would get from the sun during two cross-country flights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A potentially more dangerous problem remains at the Trojan site:  
hundreds of highly radioactive spent fuel rods. Since the federal 
government has yet to build a disposal site for such waste, PGE has 
no option but to encase the rods in canisters and leave them there.

<HEADLINE> Hearst Buying S.F. Chronicle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- One of the last great rivalries of American  
journalism has ended with the purchase of the San Francisco 
Chronicle by its century-old nemesis, the Hearst Corp., publisher 
of the San Francisco Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives announced the sale Friday, promising that employees  
of both newspapers will keep their jobs. The promise brought relief 
-- and skepticism -- to the two newsrooms, where reporters and 
editors had anxiously awaited news of a rumored sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most of our first choices would be to have two  
separate, thriving voices in the city,'' said Examiner columnist 
Stephanie Salter. ``My second choice would be to have a really 
well-financed, well-staffed mega-newspaper, a combined Examiner and 
Chronicle. That doesn't bother me at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Hearst Corp. will buy the Chronicle and then put  
the Examiner up for sale. If Hearst can't find a buyer for its 
afternoon paper, it will combine them into a morning daily, an idea 
that was immediately condemned. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll find that there are no qualified buyers and then  
they'll kill it. They'll call it the Chronicle-Examiner or some 
dreadful arthritic name and it will be a morning paper,'' said 
Bruce Brugmann, publisher of the San Francisco Bay Guardian, a free 
alternative weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the assurances of management, job cuts are almost  
inevitable, said Ben Bagdikian, former dean of the University of 
California at Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism and author of 
``The Media Monopoly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a speech made by the people doing it saying  
they're never going to lay off anybody,'' Bagdikian said on KPFA 
radio. ``In most cases, those promises aren't kept because it 
doesn't make business sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chronicle is the nation's 11th-largest daily newspaper with  
a circulation of 482,000. The Examiner sells 115,000 papers a day. 
A combined Sunday edition has a circulation of 605,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher profits were what prompted the Chronicle Publishing Co.  
board of directors to order an exploration into the sale of some or 
all of the company in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the cash acquisition were not disclosed, but the  
newspapers' Web site reported that ``speculation has placed it at a 
minimum of $500 million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Examiner Executive Editor Phil Bronstein was in the hospital  
Friday recovering from angioplasty to open a blocked artery. His 
actress-wife Sharon Stone, the subject of many catty columns in the 
Chronicle, was at his side. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to continuing to serve our readers and our  
community,'' Bronstein said in Friday's edition of the Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chronicle was founded in 1865 by brothers Charles and M.H.  
de Young and has been owned by their heirs ever since, reporting on 
the insular world of San Francisco with style. Its writers have 
included Mark Twain, Jack London and beloved columnist Herb Caen, 
who died in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Examiner, which was won as payment of a card game debt in  
1880 by the father of William Randolph Hearst, has been the 
flagship newspaper of the Hearst Corp., an empire caricatured in 
the classic film ``Citizen Kane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now one of the papers may fold, or worse in the eyes of some  
readers, they'll be combined into one noncompetitive corporate 
entity, leaving San Francisco's unruly populace with fewer ways to 
challenge authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst has a disturbing precedent for Examiner supporters: In  
October 1992, it bought the San Antonio Express-News from Rupert 
Murdoch's News Corp., then shut down its own San Antonio Light. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst President Frank Bennack Jr. said a search for a buyer  
would be ``sincere and genuine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afternoon papers have been declining for years as use of mass  
transit falls off and a longer work day takes away readers. The 
rise of alternative news media including television and now the 
Internet has also hurt afternoon papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 47 remaining cities with two or more daily newspapers,  
this merger would leave 13 cities with papers under joint operating 
agreements and 16 with papers under common ownership. Only 18 of 
these cities have independent newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chronicle Publishing has said the company would most likely be  
sold in pieces. Holdings also include the Bloomington Pantagraph in 
Illinois and the Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette in Massachusetts; 
television stations KRON, San Francisco's NBC affiliate; KAKE in 
Wichita, Kan.; and WOWT in Omaha, Neb., and two book publishing 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst is one of the country's biggest media companies. It has  
holdings in newspapers, magazines, book publishing and broadcast 
outlets that include shares of ESPN and the Lifetime network.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Finds Winning Is Not So Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Two years ago, Martina Hingis took  
advantage of a lull in women's tennis. She won 37 consecutive 
matches, three Grand Slam tournament titles and ascended to the No. 
1 ranking at age 16. 
</P>
<P>
	With Steffi Graf injured most of 1997 and Lindsay Davenport and  
sisters Venus and Serena Williams not yet developed into serious 
challengers, Hingis easily ruled the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had an open road,'' she said. ``I don't think I understood  
really what was going there at that time. I kept winning, but I 
didn't really appreciate it because it just was so easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	Hingis heads into the U.S. Open later this month wondering if  
she can still beat the top players. She admits to being nervous, a 
feeling that first consumed her a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've won five Grand Slams, I shouldn't be nervous about  
that, but still, if you can do it again, if you can beat those 
players you used to beat,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though she's ranked second, Hingis says, ``I miss being one  
of the best players in the world. I'm used to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old no longer dominates the way she did in 1997.  
She's been replaced at No. 1 by Davenport, who beat Hingis in last 
year's U.S. Open final. 
</P>
<P>
	And the once-cocky Hingis has lost crowd support this year. A  
fan shouted, ``Go home, Martina'' during one of her matches at the 
TIG Classic this week. 
</P>
<P>
	She began the year by defending her Australian Open title, but  
she ran into controversy Down Under when she reportedly described 
her opponent in the final, Amelie Mauresmo, as ``half a man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, Hingis lost to Graf in the final and repeatedly  
battled with the umpire and linesmen. Hingis was jeered by the 
crowd for serving underhand, and only returned for the awards 
ceremony at the urging of her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	She hit rock bottom at Wimbledon, losing in the first round to  
16-year-old qualifier Jelena Dokic. For the first time, she was at 
a tournament without her mother and coach Melanie Molitor, who has 
since returned to her side. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much tougher,'' Hingis said. ``I would love to have  
another year like '97.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Hingis ponders her vulnerability, so do other players.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very interesting to see how she reacts to the  
troubles she's had,'' said former No. 1 Aranxta Sanchez-Vicario. 
``I guess that's the test; to see how one reacts when they are 
down. Only time will tell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis admits she was complacent in '97. She won so often and  
easily that she never had to think much on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, everything was so natural, I just came out there and I  
had the feel and I just played my game,'' she said. ``In practice, 
I don't always have that confidence like I used to have a half-year 
ago. My body has changed and I have to work more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis took a month off after her Wimbledon disaster. She  
practiced and worked on her strength by lifting weights. And she 
thought long and hard about being the best. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want that again because you're used to it and you know it  
is possible, so you want to go back out there and beat everybody,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, Hingis believes fans forget she's still only 18, a  
teen-ager struggling to regain her place in the new world order of 
women's tennis. But even though she's heard more boos this year 
than at any time in her career, Hingis still craves the attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there wouldn't be anybody watching me, I wouldn't like  
it,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Gas Leak Cause of Texas Hotel Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) -- Investigators confirmed Saturday that a  
gas leak was to blame for a blast that ripped through a new hotel, 
seriously burning a man and injuring dozens with broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Marshal Dick Ward said natural gas lines that supplied the  
hotel's swimming pool heater caused the Friday evening explosion at 
the Embassy Suites Outdoor World. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas E. Marcer, a subcontractor who was working on the heater  
when the blast occurred, remained in serious condition Saturday at 
Parkland Hospital in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcer, interviewed by authorities Saturday in his hospital  
room, and another worker apparently didn't know there was gas in 
the line as they worked on it, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no negligence involved by either one of these  
technicians,'' the fire marshal said. ``They were doing their jobs 
properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ward said the gas was ignited either by an electrical pump or an  
ignitor system on the pool equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion blew through an exterior wall and a gift shop only  
three days after the hotel opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten people, including six children, were treated for minor  
injuries at nearby hospitals. About two dozen other people were 
treated by paramedics at the scene for cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the 330-unit hotel, located near Dallas-Fort  
Worth International Airport, might reopen early next week.

<HEADLINE> Man Allegedly Helped Wife's Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A 75-year-old man has been charged with  
manslaughter for allegedly hanging a noose from a ceiling beam and 
leaving his ailing wife alone to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Florio, 75, pleaded innocent Friday and was ordered held  
on $10,000 bail, said Sherry Hunter, spokeswoman for the Queens 
district attorney. If convicted, he could face up to 15 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a very loving couple and now the family is dealing  
with a tragedy of immense proportion,'' said Florio's lawyer, John 
Halton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Florio, 70, was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and heart  
problems earlier this year. Her husband told police that she had 
repeatedly asked for his help in committing suicide as her health 
deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, Florio allegedly drilled a hole through a  
ceiling beam in their home. Investigators said he then ran the rope 
through it and left a slipknot noose dangling. He left the 
apartment Thursday morning, and returned that afternoon to find his 
wife dead, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Halton would not comment on the circumstances of Mrs. Florio's  
death.

<HEADLINE> A's Raines Suffering From Lupus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Tim Raines will concede this much in his  
battle against Lupus -- he won't be able to play baseball for the 
rest of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm not going to retire, so don't even ask me that  
question,'' a defiant Raines said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	There are many reasons why the 39-year-old Oakland Athletics  
outfielder, one of baseball's top base stealers and leadoff batters 
over a 20-year career, wants to stay in the game. But perhaps the 
biggest reason is the hope he can one day play on the same team as 
his son, 19-year-old Tim Raines Jr., who is in the Baltimore 
Orioles' farm system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the opportunity to play with my son,'' said Raines.  
</P>
<P>
	Raines, who went on the disabled list July 19 because of  
swelling in his kidneys, added that when it's time for him to leave 
the game, he hopes to do it on his terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually felt this year, I didn't get a chance to make a  
decision on whether this was it for me,'' he said. ``I want to be 
able to do that. I've been around 21 years. I still enjoy the game. 
I still enjoy being around my team. I still enjoy the competition. 
I feel like I can still play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raines said he feels pretty good physically right now, though an  
intense treatment regimen has left him feeling fatigued. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Elliott Schwartz described Lupus as a connective tissue  
disease in which the immune system turns against a person's own 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might think of it as the body almost becoming allergic to  
its own tissues,'' Schwartz said. ``In Tim's case, his body became 
almost allergic to his own kidneys, starting an inflammation 
process in those kidneys. We've given him medications to suppress 
that inflammation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz said if the disease remains in remission, Raines could  
be ready for spring training next year. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no known cure for Lupus, but its symptoms can be  
treated. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're sick and you're a ballplayer, you always feel a  
pill is going to make you better,'' Raines said. ``But I think any 
time you get into a situation where it's maybe a life or death 
thing, you tend to think about it and wonder what you're going 
through. 
</P>
<P>
	``As baseball players, we kind of live a sheltered life, good,  
bad or ugly. I mean, you're on the top of the world. You feel like 
nothing can ever get to you. I think what I've gone through over 
the last three weeks, it's been pretty humbling, because I haven't 
been able to do the things I love to do and that's play baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raines, who broke into the majors in 1979 with Montreal, ranks  
first among active players in triples (112), second in stolen bases 
(807) and third in runs scored (1,548). 
</P>
<P>
	He was 6-for-18 (.333) as a pinch-hitter this season, but  
2-for-15 over his last five games before being disabled. He was 
batting .215 overall in 58 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines became bloated and mysteriously gained 15 pounds near the  
All-Star break. A kidney biopsy was performed July 23, and after an 
analysis conducted at the University of California, San Francisco, 
he was diagnosed with Lupus. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines said he had never before heard of the disease.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's always a relief to find out what's wrong with  
you,'' he said. ``I know I never felt like that before. I didn't 
feel like I was dying but I wanted to know what was wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raines underwent four days of treatment at Summitt Hospital in  
Oakland, where he was given high doses of medications designed to 
relieve the swelling in his kidneys and to try keep his immune 
system from attacking his own body. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has had extensive treatment with powerful  
immunosuppressants and he has responded very, very well,'' Schwartz 
said. ``The fluid weight has all gone out of his body. His blood 
pressure, which was very high, has returned to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's at home feeling better and we need to follow his kidney  
function and how he's doing regularly from now on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz said Raines would be undergoing intensive treatment for  
the next couple months. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if everything goes optimally, we would hope that he could  
be ready for spring training in the year 2000,'' Schwartz said.

<HEADLINE> Cubs May Open 2000 in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs players are willing to open the 2000  
baseball season with a two-game series against the New York Mets in 
Japan if an acceptable agreement can be worked out with the players 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't a vote, but the team has agreed we want to go,''  
player representative Steve Trachsel said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Issues that still need to be decided are flight schedules,  
accommodations, off days and the number of family members allowed 
to go along, Trachsel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The experience would be great. I think we're the last major  
sport not to play overseas. That would be great to expand the 
sport, and of course Sammy's popularity is a big thing,'' Trachsel 
said, referring to Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa traveled with Major League Baseball's postseason exhibition  
team last fall and was hailed by Japanese fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs will wait to take an official vote on the offer until  
after negotiations with Japanese officials are over.

<HEADLINE> Chautauqua's Influence Still Felt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAUTAUQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- The word ``Chautauqua'' comes from the  
Senecas; it means ``one has taken out fish there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Chautauqua Institution has given the word another,  
universal meaning: Chautauquas are places where people come 
together to share ideas and the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	By the 1920s, it was estimated that one in three Americans had  
had some contact with Chautauqua programs. But by World War II, 
most local and traveling Chautauquas had died out. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, they have had a resurgence. Each summer, the  
Great Plains Chautauqua, founded in 1978, visits 10 towns in six 
states -- the Dakotas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Kansas and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most of the new Chautauquas, it sets up a tent under which  
scholars impersonate historical figures like Theodore Roosevelt and 
Booker T. Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really transports you there,'' says Barbara Gill, whose  
Heartland Chautauqua makes stops in Missouri and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Chautauqua resonates in other ways. In his 1974 book ``Zen and  
the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,'' Robert M. Pirsig talks about 
Chautauqua. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that we do have some time, and know it, I would like to  
use the time to talk in some depth about things that seem 
important. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is in mind is a sort of Chautauqua ... that's the only  
name I can think of for it ... like the traveling tent-show 
Chautauquas that used to move across America, this America, the one 
that we are now in, an old-time series of popular talks intended to 
edify and entertain, improve the mind and bring culture and 
enlightenment to the ears and thoughts of the hearer. The 
Chautauquas were pushed aside by faster-paced radio, movies and TV, 
and it seems to me the change was not entirely an improvement. 
Perhaps because of these changes the stream of national 
consciousness moves faster now, and is broader, but it seems to run 
less deep. The old channels cannot contain it and in its search for 
new ones there seems to be growing havoc and destruction along its 
banks. In this Chautauqua I would like not to cut any new channels 
of consciousness but simply dig deeper into old ones that have 
become silted in with the debris of thoughts grown stale and 
platitudes too often repeated.''

<HEADLINE> Caymans Fret About Banking Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands (AP) -- Blackbeard and other pirates  
used the swampy mangrove lagoon off Grand Cayman as a hideout -- and 
if U.S. investigators and critics of offshore banking are correct, 
not much has changed since. 
</P>
<P>
	Claims by U.S. investigators that the spectacularly successful  
Caymans financial industry is a safe haven for a fortune in unpaid 
U.S. taxes sent alarm bells ringing throughout the community of 
some 40,000, which also happens to be the world's fifth largest 
banking center. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could be bad -- real bad,'' said Glenrick Randall, a car  
rental agent. ``It's so unfair. Pretty soon everybody be pulling 
their money out of Cayman! Who'll I rent cars to then?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like everyone here, Randall knew all about John M. Mathewson of  
San Antonio, Texas, who was sentenced Monday in a Newark, N.J., 
federal court for helping U.S. citizens evade taxes while running 
the now-defunct Guardian Bank and Trust Limited of the Cayman 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson got off with probation by providing what U.S. District  
Judge Alfred J. Lechner called ``unparalleled'' cooperation: 
computerized records that could produce tax evasion charges against 
1,500 U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	That prospect rattles Caymanians, who take great pride in their  
zero direct taxation, a lack of exchange controls, and bankers who, 
according to a satisfied client in John Grisham's ``The Firm,'' 
``make the Swiss look like blabbermouths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In hushed tones, bankers and officials here disputed Mathewson's  
claims that his actions were commonplace -- and suggestions by U.S. 
officials that by obtaining the secret codes to Guardian's files, 
they might have pierced other banks' secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolute nonsense,'' said Nick Duggan, managing director of  
the Brown Brothers Harriman and Co. branch. ``It's a black eye. 
It's an embarrassment. But I think in time it'll blow away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Eduardo D'Angelo Silva, manager of the Caymans' Sul America  
International Bank and president of the Cayman Islands' Bankers 
Association, said the case ``could put at risk what we've been 
building for two or three decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question for Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Carney, lead  
prosecutor on the Mathewson case, is exactly what have the Caymans 
been building. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no great business in the Caymans. It doesn't have its  
own capital market. Its services are not any better,'' Carney said. 
``What it has is the secrecy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neville Grant, managing director of the Cayman Monetary  
Authority, defended the Caymans, noting that local authorities shut 
down Guardian three years ago -- although Mathewson said it happened 
because he refused to pay bribes. More recently, three banks were 
liquidated for unspecified financial irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant cited a 1996 law that allows criminal courts to recover  
proceeds from serious offenses and bars bankers from assisting in 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want people who will bring us disrepute,'' he said in  
an interview in his yellow-brick and glass headquarters in George 
Town, where serious young people in suits and ties scurry between 
modern buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are gateways through the secrecy laws,'' Grant said,  
``but we also don't want to help people obtain information because 
they're on fishing expeditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So the disagreement appears to be over where the bar is set --  
and critics say it's not quite low enough yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Intriago, publisher of the Miami-based newsletter Money  
Laundering Alert, said the Caymans and other Caribbean banking 
centers have too often been reluctant to open their records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rarely does a major money laundering case arise, especially in  
the United States, that does not have a Cayman Islands peg, either 
through the use of an offshore facility or through one of the 
corporations formed in the Caymans,'' Intriago said. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1503, the Caymans were  
ceded by Spain to England in 1670 and remain a colony by choice. 
But London seems to exert limited pull. Its efforts to bring the 
Caymanian banking system in line with Europe's have received polite 
rebuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements,  
in December 1998 Caymanian banks held $521.5 billion in foreign 
institutional deposits -- behind only the United States, the United 
Kingdom, Germany and Japan. That doesn't include another $100 
billion or so in individuals' deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also a huge insurance sector and more registered  
companies -- about 45,000 -- than people. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks employ a tenth of the workforce, Grant estimated, and  
provide about a fifth of the roughly $1 billion gross national 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's defenders argue that Caribbean islands with few  
natural resources deserve a break. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at the Cayman Islands and ask yourself what they've got  
to sustain themselves,'' said Ivelaw Griffith, an offshore banking 
expert at Florida International University. ``It's always a 
delicate thing to balance trying to clamp down on illegitimacy 
while not destroying their economies.''

<HEADLINE>  Turkish Union Leader Shot to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZONGULDAK, Turkey (AP) -- The deputy head of Turkey's largest  
labor union confederation was shot to death outside his home early 
Saturday in the Black Sea coastal city of Zonguldak, the Anatolia 
news agency said. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Uneasiness Seen on Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The wave of worry that washed over Wall Street  
this past week had one primary source: fears of higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But for weeks now, markets have also been rattled by a pesky  
undercurrent of currency woes. The U.S. dollar has been in a slide 
against the Japanese yen and the euro as global economies improve, 
suggesting to investors around the world that the United States is 
far from the only place to put their money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The relative weakness of the dollar has surprised people,''  
said Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at Dain Rauscher 
Wessels in Minneapolis. ``It's a wild card that has definitely had 
an impact on Wall Street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday afternoon, a dollar bought 114.15 yen, up slightly  
from a six-month low of 113.65 reached Thursday. As recently as May 
20, a dollar was worth 124.82 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has also fallen against the euro, the European common  
currency that sank after its debut in January. The dollar hit a 
three-month low of $1.0824 against the euro on Thursday before 
recovering to $1.0734 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has been pulled down by a number of factors,  
including jitters about higher interest rates, uncertainty about 
economic policy and a burgeoning recovery of Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The story that's emerging is that there are signs of growth  
outside the U.S.,'' said Allison Montgomery, currency economist 
with IDEAGlobal.com in New York. ``Capital is shifting to different 
parts of the world for the first time in quite a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the second quarter, international mutual funds had a positive  
inflow of cash for the first time in more than a year, according to 
the Investment Company Institute. Japan isn't the only attraction; 
Russian, European and Brazilian investments are all on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent weakness in U.S. stocks has multiple roots, and even  
if the dollar regains some of its strength, that won't necessarily 
bolster the stock market. That's because currencies and stock 
markets don't always move in step, said Marc Chandler, chief 
currency strategist at Mellon Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market is anchored to the business cycle,'' he said.  
``Currency is not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, a strong dollar could fortify the broader economy,  
warding off market menaces like inflation. A strong dollar makes 
imports cheaper, so while U.S. consumers have spent heavily on 
foreign-made goods like sports cars and CD players, they've been 
able to do so without touching off inflation. Heavy U.S. demand 
helped Asia climb out of its financial crisis of 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's the catch: All those foreign goods have created a massive  
trade deficit with the rest of the world. The big trade gap doesn't 
trouble economists as long as foreign investors bought into U.S. 
stocks and bonds. But once foreign economies start to improve, 
overseas investors begin keeping their money at home. They buy 
fewer U.S. stocks, and they don't need to buy dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll be even more likely to give up their U.S. investments if  
the Federal Reserve raises interest rates for a second time, as 
many analysts expect. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed's decision has the potential to disrupt the fragile  
balance in the global economy,'' said Kathy Jones, director of 
futures research at Prudential Securities. Higher interest rates 
make stocks less appealing as escalating borrowing costs cut into 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for the dollar's decline is the reluctance of  
U.S. officials to take steps to push it higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's strength in recent years was reinforced by former  
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who made a strong dollar a 
cornerstone of his economic policy. Rubin stepped down in May, and 
while his successor, Lawrence Summers, has maintained his interest 
in a strong U.S. currency, he has not yet been willing to intervene 
in the currency market. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers has balanced his policy efforts with Japan's strong  
desire to prevent the yen from rising too far, too fast. Japan has 
already spent $30 billion to buy dollars, hoping to raise their 
value and hold down the rising yen. A stronger yen would make 
Japanese goods more expensive overseas, which could crush the 
recovery before it truly takes off. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler believes that the dollar remains safe and stable,  
pointing out that the U.S. currency is extremely strong compared to 
that of some key trading partners -- the Canadian dollar, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plenty of people think this is just a long overdue  
correction,'' he said. ``I think the dollar is strong and I think 
the stock market is strong. You can have both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average was the only  
major market indicator to end higher, rising 58.88 points. The Dow 
lost 79.79 points Friday, closing at 10,714.03. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq ended the week with a loss of 90.52 points, slipping  
17.86 on Friday to close at 2,547.97. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index lost 28.43 for the week,  
dropping 13.42 Friday to close at 1,300.29. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange composite was down 15.03 for the  
week, losing 6.35 Friday to close at 611.04. The American Stock 
Exchange composite lost 10.31 on the week and closed at 777.92, 
rising 1.83 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, which reflects the performance of  
small-company stocks, plunged 16.73 for the week to 428.04, after 
falling 1.71 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- which represents the  
combined market value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- 
ended the week at $11.84 trillion, off $326.96 billion from last 
week. A year ago the index was $10.17 trillion.

<HEADLINE> GOP Govs. Wary of Tax Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Suspicious of their party leaders in  
Washington, Republican governors applauded Congress' tax cut plan 
Saturday but warned that they will not let GOP lawmakers raid state 
budgets to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican congressional leaders have considered asking the  
nation's governors to return up to $6 billion in welfare money to 
help balance the books on their 10-year, $792 billion tax cut 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Several governors accused fellow Republicans in Washington of  
trying to renege on pledges to ship the money to states. They 
suggested the development could damage their promised partnership 
with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``This must be a calamitous staff error, because I can't believe  
they would do this to us,'' said Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, 
attending the four-day National Governors' Association meeting, 
which opened Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would lose a great deal of credibility and I don't think  
they want to do that,'' said Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, a 
national leader on welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing force in Republican politics, the GOP governors said  
they are confident congressional leaders are preparing to back 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	But even the prospect of success has not dampened the state  
leaders' bitterness. For most governors, the first word of a plan 
to seek state money came from press accounts -- not their leadership 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Governors do not like being kept out of the loop, especially  
after the leadership promised in 1998 to give them a greater role 
in framing policy and political strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``With any partnership, you've got to make sure your partner is  
reliable,'' Gov. John Engler of Michigan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said congressional leaders owed  
governors more information -- a ``heads up'' -- about their plans for 
the welfare money. ``It better be heads up or heads off,'' he said 
after a briefing conducted by the GOP state executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors' stock rose after huge victories in the 1998  
elections underscored the popularity of their mainstream, can-do 
politics while confrontational congressional Republicans suffered a 
series of election night defeats. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking the return of money would be an irony for a political  
party whose oft-stated philosophy is to dispense dollars and power 
to the states. It also might force Republican governors to forsake 
tax cuts at home for spending needs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal posed a dilemma for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the  
elected leader of the nation's second-largest state and the 
front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Bush ``supports keeping the funds  
in the states and hopes Congress will listen to the nation's 
governors on this issue.'' Bush was not attending the NGA meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Under welfare reform legislation enacted in 1996, the nation's  
governors were guaranteed current levels of funding for five years. 
Governors lobbied for the guarantee, saying they had assumed a 
heavy risk because the need for welfare money could outstrip the 
supply of federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	The states have dramatically reduced welfare rolls and, in some  
cases, have surplus welfare money. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Gov. Michael Leavitt of Utah, incoming chairman of  
the governors' group, said Congress needs to realize the states are 
done with the easiest part of welfare reform; the toughest and most 
expensive cases -- welfare recipients with the lowest prospect for 
jobs -- remain a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's keep the financial integrity of our relationship (with  
Congress) intact,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of seeking state money was broached last month by Rep.  
Tom DeLay of Texas, the GOP whip, and approved by Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Several governors and their aides said they suspected the idea  
was leaked to reporters to test the level of opposition, which is 
high. Engler said the leadership used the threat to show 
rank-and-file lawmakers what might happen if they propose too much 
new spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fizzled,'' Thompson said of the idea. He and several  
other high-profile state executives personally lobbied 
congressional leaders in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., and Hastert are making separate  
appearances at the governors' meeting and are expected to offer an 
olive branch, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no clear signal Saturday that the leadership was  
backing down. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the House,  
said Saturday he has not heard from an unhappy governor. A second 
House GOP leader, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, was more pointed: 
``If it's good to cut taxes at the state level, it's good to cut 
taxes at the federal level,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, former governor of Arkansas, has promised to  
veto the GOP tax plan, and may warn governors in a speech Sunday at 
their meeting that the cuts will hurt state budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Clinton also was expected to implore the governors to  
be more aggressive in enrolling children in the 1997 Children's 
Health Insurance Program in which Congress allocated the states $25 
billion over five years to provide health coverage for children who 
do not qualify for Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton recently expressed disappointment that only about 1.3  
million children have been enrolled in the new program, when he 
says should have at least 3 million covered by now. 
</P>
<P>
	The aides said Clinton also will outline plans to send federal  
health insurance officials into the states to make sure they are 
maximizing outreach programs to children who are eligible for 
Medicaid and that the Education Department will be enlisted to work 
through schools to inform parents about health coverage available 
for their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Notwithstanding an element of prodding in his remarks, one aide  
said the president will assure the governors he is on their side 
and that he will resist any efforts in Congress to pull back unused 
welfare money or the unspent child health insurance funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax cut dispute has muted the governors' praise of the  
congressional package. Leavitt said he support ``the theory of 
cutting taxes'' but wanted to see the details of the congressional 
plan before endorsing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating delivered the national radio address for the party  
Saturday, criticizing the Clinton-Gore administration's tax 
history. ``They want to use it to buy more government,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 31 Republican governors and 17 Democrats. Gov. Jesse  
Ventura of Minnesota is a member of the Reform Party. Gov. Angus 
King of Maine is an independent.

<HEADLINE> Perez Withdraws Suspension Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Catcher Eddie Perez withdrew his appeal of a  
four-game suspension and will begin serving the penalty today when 
the Braves play the San Francisco Giants in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez was suspended and fined $1,000 for triggering a brawl in a  
game with the Philadelphia Phillies last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble began after Phillies pitcher Paul Byrd hit Perez in  
the third inning, the second time in less than a week that Byrd hit 
his former teammate with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The following inning, the pair exchanged words when Byrd came to  
the plate. Perez threw a punch, setting off the brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Braves manager Bobby Cox drew a two-game suspension, which he  
served, for his actions in the same game. Cox returned to the field 
after being ejected in the previous inning for arguing a 
double-play call. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he came back to restore order.  
</P>
<P>
	Perez will miss the final two games of the Giants' series and  
the start of a series with the Houston Astros.

<HEADLINE> Thinking Not 'Free' at Chautauqua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAUTAUQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- Even the people who own homes on the  
grounds of the Chautauqua Institution must pay a fee to get in 
during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Chautauqua is a gated community; admission is charged every day  
but Sunday, although children under 12 and adults over 90 get in 
free. Tickets range from $6 for an afternoon, to $190 for a week, 
to $815 for the nine-week season. 
</P>
<P>
	Once you're in, there are other expenses. Admission is charged  
for some entertainment (this year's performers included Wynonna and 
the Beach Boys), theater and opera. There are fees for classes, and 
tuition for Chautauqua's children's school. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors can stay in denominational houses, inns, guest houses,  
rental apartments and houses or hotels. There are restaurants and 
shops, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everything has a price tag. Lectures, services and poetry  
readings are free, as are symphony and dance. There are also 
exhibitions of work by visual arts students, and performances by

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Nephew Wins Appeal in Conn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Statements made by a nephew of the late  
Sen. Robert Kennedy at a substance abuse center should not be 
disclosed to a grand jury investigating an unsolved 1975 killing, a 
judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Skakel, whose father is a brother of Kennedy widow Ethel  
Kennedy, is being investigated in the Oct. 30, 1975, bludgeoning of 
15-year-old Martha Moxley of Greenwich. 
</P>
<P>
	The Connecticut Appellate Court ruled Thursday that a lower  
court erred when it rejected Skakel's claim that statements he made 
at the Elan school in Poland Spring, Maine, were protected by 
psychiatrist-patient privilege. 
</P>
<P>
	Skakel's lawyers called it a clear victory in their attempt to  
stop prosecutors from forcing Joseph Riccim, the owner of the Elan 
school, from testifying before a grand jury investigating Moxley's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claim that Ricci overheard or knew about potentially  
incriminating statements Skakel made while he attended the school 
in the years 1978 to 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	In hearings last fall, Skakel's lawyers argued that any  
statements he made at the school were confidential because the 
facility specialized in the psychological treatment of teen-agers 
with substance abuse problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Skakel, who was 15 at the time of the killing, and his older  
brother Thomas, then 17, have been identified as suspects in the 
girl's death. Both brothers have denied any involvement in her 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Moxley lived across the street from the Skakels in the exclusive  
Belle Haven section of Greenwich. 
</P>
<P>
	She was beaten to death with a golf club on her family's estate.  
The 6-iron was later matched to a set owned by the Skakel family.

<HEADLINE> Gwynn Reaches 3,000-Hit Milestone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Tony Gwynn has worn a lot of different uniform  
designs and color schemes on his way to joining the 3,000-hit club. 
Most important to him, they've all been uniforms of the San Diego 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joining the 3,000-hit club as a member of one team and one  
team only, that has a nice ring to it as far as I'm concerned,'' 
Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	With a base hit in his first at-bat Friday night Gwynn became  
the 22nd major leaguer to reach 3,000 hits, and just the eighth 
player to record all of them with one major league team. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished the night with four hits as the Padres beat the  
Montreal Expos 12-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn took care of the milestone hit in his first at-bat as he  
reached down and golfed a soft line drive past second base on a 1-2 
pitch from Dan Smith, a rookie making his 11th career start. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn's teammates raced from the dugout to congratulate him, and  
first base umpire Kerwin Danley -- Gwynn's college teammate at San 
Diego State -- gave him a hug. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball and the first base bag were taken out of play, with one  
or both likely to end up in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``The relief that you feel is the first thing that hits you,''  
Gwynn said. ``Then I was starting to get emotional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fireworks, usually reserved for Expos' home runs, were set off  
as soon as the hit dropped in, and Gwynn's mother, Vendella, 
celebrating her 64th birthday, came onto the field and embraced her 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn became the first NL player since the Cardinals' Lou Brock  
in 1979 to reach 3,000 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	He reached the milestone in front of 13,540 fans -- more than  
30,000 fewer than watched him get his 2,999th hit Thursday in St. 
Louis when Mark McGwire hit his 500th and 501st homer.

	Gunmen Surround Russian Villages  
</P>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian helicopter gunships today  
attacked gunmen surrounding three villages in the troubled and 
violent Caucasus region, near the border of breakaway Chechnya. The 
militants crossed from Chechnya into Dagestan early today and took 
up positions around the villages of Ansalta and Rakhata, Interior 
Ministry officials said. The rebel group has said it wants to merge 
the republics into one Islamic state. The gunmen appeared to be 
from the fundamentalist Wahhabi Islamic movement, which has been 
active in Chechnya and Dagestan since the 1994 launch of Chechnya's 
war for independence. Chechnya won de facto independence from 
Russia in the war, though Moscow still claims it is part of Russia.

	Clinton Aims To Eliminate Poverty  
</P>
<P>
	HELENA, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton today promised to devote  
the rest of his term to eliminating the poverty that clings to this 
neglected corner of his home state and other parts of the 
Mississippi delta region, where unemployment is twice the national 
average. Clinton stopped in Helena for a private meeting with 54 
local officials, who are organizing a commission to take on the 
enormous problems of the Delta, from education to housing and civic 
infrastructure. The president submitted his so-called ``new 
markets'' legislative proposal to Congress last week. It includes a 
series of tax incentives and lending guarantees for new investment.

	Black Gets S. African Bank Post  
</P>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa's all-important  
central bank today was placed in the hands of Tito Mboweni, moving 
forward the country's transformation from a white-dominated land to 
a multiracial society. Mboweni, a former labor minister, becomes 
Reserve Bank governor while most of South Africa's majority blacks 
remain mired in poverty five years after apartheid collapsed. 
Mboweni shoved aside notions that the Reserve Bank should 
accelerate the transformation of South Africa from a society where 
only whites had privilege to one where opportunity awaited 
everyone, saying: ``Our role is to ensure there is a stable 
financial environment. Our mandate is very narrow.''

	Governors Wary of Tax Cut Plan  
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Republican governors meeting today warned that  
they will not let GOP lawmakers raid state budgets to pay for the 
GOP's congressional tax cut plan. Several governors accused fellow 
Republicans in Washington of trying to renege on pledges to ship 
the money to states. They suggested the development could damage 
their promised partnership with Washington. Republican 
congressional leaders have considered asking the nation's governors 
to return up to $6 billion in welfare money to help balance the 
books on their 10-year, $792 billion tax cut proposal.

	Bomb Hurled at Israeli Soldiers  
</P>
<P>
	HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -- Attackers threw a gasoline bomb into an  
Israeli army jeep today, injuring two soldiers and further 
aggravating the region's ethnic tensions. The incident occurred in 
the Israeli-controlled sector of this tensely divided West Bank 
city, where two Jewish settlers were injured Tuesday, apparently by 
militant Palestinian gunmen. Since then the area's 30,000 
Palestinians have been barred from leaving or entering Hebron, and 
have been kept in their homes by a curfew. There have been several 
clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian stone throwers on 
the region's dividing line in the past few days.

	Boggs Homers for 3,000th Hit

	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Wade Boggs became the first player  
to homer for his 3,000th hit, connecting in the sixth inning for a 
two-run shot tonight against Cleveland. Boggs reached his lifelong 
goal and celebrated with an emotional trip around the bases. Boggs 
pointed upwards -- a tribute to his mother, killed in a 1986 car 
accident -- as he became the 23rd player to get 3,000 hits. A few 
steps from home, Boggs again pointed up. He then got down on his 
knees and kissed home plate as his teammates waited to embrace him.

tennis tournament today with a 4-6, 6-1, 6-3 victory over 
ninth-seeded Nicolas Kiefer of Germany. Johansson advances to face 
the winner of today's other semifinal matching Andre Agassi and 
Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia. In the semifinals, Johansson came in 
fresh from having played an early match the day before while Kiefer 
was still recovering from a late-night, three-set victory over 
top-seeded Patrick Rafter of Australia. Johansson now stands one 
victory away from the biggest victory of his career.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promotes 'Untapped' Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton promised Saturday to  
devote the rest of his presidency to erasing the poverty that 
clings stubbornly to places like this neglected corner of his home 
state. ``We ought to really make an effort,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stopped in Helena for a private meeting with 54 local  
officials, who are organizing a commission to take on the enormous 
problems of the Mississippi Delta, from education to housing and 
civic infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit also was designed to assuage hurt feelings -- Clinton  
opted to stop in nearby Clarksdale, Miss., rather than Helena, 
during his national poverty tour last month. But here, Clinton 
noted that Eastern Arkansas has ``been very good to me for more 
than 20 years now,'' and made an unequivocal promise that he did 
not make during the earlier tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you to know that in the year and a half that I have  
left on my term, I am going to do everything I can to bring more 
economic opportunity not only to the delta, but to every place in 
America that is not a part of what our country as a whole is 
enjoying today,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president submitted his so-called ``new markets''  
legislative proposal to Congress last week. It includes a series of 
tax incentives and lending guarantees for new investment that 
Clinton said could turn places like Helena into ripe markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to really make an effort,'' Clinton said. ``There's a  
great feeling in the Congress, and I think in both parties, that we 
ought to do something for the areas that have still not felt the 
economic recovery of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing a few hundred people inside an aging hangar at the  
municipal airport, Clinton noted that unemployment in the delta 
region was twice the national average, despite 19 million new jobs 
created in the six years of Clinton's presidency. He said the 
country can no longer afford to overlook the needs of the 
Mississippi Delta. 
</P>
<P>
	But overlooked seems the best way to describe Helena, a town of  
7,491 perched on the banks of the Mississippi River. The hangar 
where Clinton spoke was rusty, its paint peeling, its inside dusty 
and dark. Rep. Marion Berry, D-Ark., jokingly told Clinton that he 
could smell 100 years' worth of cotton dust inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's motorcade rolled past dozens of squat, crumbling  
houses. Not one building looked new, and there were no national 
retail chains along Helena's main roads. A large lumber company sat 
closed, its sign out front offering it for rent or sale. A few feet 
away, a huge billboard touted the four fine restaurants at the Lady 
Luck river casino. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some concern we have not done as much as we could have  
in the delta,'' Berry said. He described the private meeting as ``a 
very frank discussion'' of Helena's crying needs. One of the main 
priorities, he said, was to attract manufacturing and agribusiness 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The 54 officials -- about half of whom were white, the remainder  
black or Asian -- also discussed race relations in the delta. 
Clinton aide Bob Nash, a native of Helena, acknowledged some racial 
tensions but said economic worries eclipse them. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, the president returned to Little Rock to join Vice  
President Al Gore at a fund-raiser expected to raise $250,000 for 
Gore's presidential campaign.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Hugh Grant managed to saunter into an Atlanta bar  
undetected by the 150 fans assembled to see him. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant dropped by the Rose &AMP; Crown Pub on Thursday to discuss his  
upcoming comedy, ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' on a radio program. 
</P>

Julia Roberts while they were shooting a love scene for the 
romantic comedy released earlier this summer.

<HEADLINE> Vermont Eugenic Project Uncovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A doctoral student has uncovered a dark secret in  
Vermont's past: Scientists in the 1920s and 30s had an active 
eugenics plan to eliminate the state's ``degenerate'' bloodlines 
and replenish ``old pioneer stock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a book to be published later this year, Nancy Gallagher  
details the plan called the ``Vermont Eugenics Survey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-year survey, developed by an independent team of social  
scientists, studied ``good'' and ``bad'' families in the state and 
listed those which it determined needed to be eliminated, Gallagher 
told The Boston Globe for a story in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was circulated among policymakers at the time and led  
to the passage of a 1931 sterilization law. 
</P>
<P>
	The law resulted in the sterilization of several hundred poor,  
rural Vermonters, Abenaki Indians and others deemed unfit to 
procreate, the Globe reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermont was hardly alone in embracing eugenics, the science of  
human breeding that branched off from social Darwinism. 
</P>
<P>
	The concept was to manage the misery of the poor. Studies had  
suggested domestic abuse and alcoholism were thought to be caused 
by recessive genes and inbreeding. Thus, by reducing the number of 
babies born to sick or unwed parents, and by attracting desirable 
settlers, social scientists thought they could a build a healthier 
society, the Globe reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher said Vermonters seemed willing to accept eugenic  
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	She said public records of the eugenics project reflect an  
abhorrent mindset of scientists. One, Dr. Henry Perkins of the 
University of Vermont, came up with ``pedigrees of degeneracy,'' 
Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1931, Perkins' work prompted Vermont to become the 31st state  
to enact a sterilization law for the handicapped or ``the 
feeble-minded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Records do not show the extent to which the sterilization policy  
was enforced or how the option was presented to its subjects. The 
laws were rolled back in the 1960s and 70s. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher, a 50-year old former biology teacher, said she  
initially hesitated pursuing her thesis because she knew some 
families would find their relatives among those the scientists 
considered unfit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every step of the way, I wondered if I should even be writing  
it,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Honors Bombing Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright marked  
the one-year anniversary of the fatal bombings at two U.S. 
embassies in Africa with a pledge today that ``we will not rest'' 
until the terrorists are caught. 
</P>
<P>
	A letter from President Clinton, read at a State Department  
ceremony, said: ``The intended victims of this vicious crime stood 
for everything that is right about our country and the world, 
Americans and Africans working together for peace and progress and 
a better future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bombings at the embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and  
Dar-es-Salaam in neighboring Tanzania killed 224 people, including 
12 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen people have been charged by U.S. federal prosecutors  
in New York in the nearly simultaneous attacks. Nine suspects 
remain at large, including Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, accused 
of ordering the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright told about 250 invited guests that the mourning -- and  
search for justices -- continues. In attendance were friends and 
families of the U.S. victims, and some of the injured Africans 
still receiving medical treatment in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we vow that America will not be intimidated. We will not  
retreat from the world. We will not rest until every one of those 
responsible for the embassy bombings has been brought to justice 
and we thank our law enforcement and intelligence personnel for the 
progress already made,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in a letter read by the national security adviser,  
Sandy Berger, added: ``Terrorists murdered these men and women and 
tore the hearts of those who loved them. But their violence could 
not and did not destroy the ideals for which their victims stood. 
Instead, we have only intensified our commitment to fundamental 
values, democracy and human rights, justice and tolerance.''

<HEADLINE> Ore. Reactor Heads for Burial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAINIER, Ore. (AP) -- Entombed in concrete and 6-inch steel, the  
radioactive reactor of the largest U.S. nuclear power plant ever to 
be shut down was loaded onto a barge Friday and began a 270-mile 
river journey skirting the northern edge of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time a commercial reactor of this size -- and  
level of contamination -- will pass so near a major American city, 
according to officials at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the 
agency overseeing the decommissioning of the Trojan Nuclear Plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the utility that owns the reactor, which is headed for  
burial 45 feet deep on the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in 
Washington, considered the river journey risky, and 
environmentalists were worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying if the reactor falls off into the water,  
everybody would have to be evacuated from Portland, but it would 
not be good for the Columbia River to have a reactor vessel sitting 
in it,'' said Lloyd Marbet, who led three unsuccessful ballot 
initiatives to have the plant shut down. ``The fact of the matter 
is that the interior of the vessel contains a very high level of 
radioactivity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moving the 1,000-ton reactor is contentious because  
environmentalists had urged the plant's owner, Portland General 
Electric, to mothball the entire site for at least 50 years and 
wait for the radioactive isotopes to cool down before dismantling 
the facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, PGE opted to barge the reactor vessel from its current  
site, 42 miles northwest of Portland on the banks of the Columbia 
River, to the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. Before moving the 
towering, dumbbell-shaped object, it was shrink-wrapped in blue 
plastic and plastered with a sign reading ``Radioactive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chugging along no faster than 12 mph, a tug was to take the  
barge past Portland by early Saturday and continue upstream until 
it reaches the Port of Benton dock near Hanford sometime Sunday. 
From there, two trucks creeping along at 5 mph will pull the vessel 
on a 320-wheel, 16-axle trailer to Hanford, 15 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Utility officials say barging the leakproof reactor is the  
safest way to decommission the plant, which for 16 years generated 
enough electricity to power all of Portland. It was closed in 1993, 
two decades earlier than planned, after a series of problems, 
including a faulty safety system that drew federal fines, the 
accidental release of radioactive gases and cracked steam tubes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would characterize it as a risky move, but it's a lot safer  
than the traditional method of cutting the reactor into pieces and 
trucking it over the highway,'' PGE spokesman Kregg Arntson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, a train hauled away the reactor vessel of the Yankee  
Rowe nuclear plant in Massachusetts, but unlike Trojan, it weighed 
only 360 tons and was not transported through heavily populated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland General Electric already has shipped off Trojan's  
contaminated steam generators in five trips to Hanford since 1995, 
and the Navy has long shipped old reactors from submarines and 
cruisers up the Columbia for burial at the site -- all without any 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The only difference is that the Trojan reactor contains 15 times  
as much radioactivity as those objects, according to state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Arntson said the vessel poses little risk to the workers  
handling it or residents living along the river, once it is encased 
in concrete. A person standing within six feet of the reactor for 
an hour would receive no more radiation than an airplane passenger 
would get from the sun during two cross-country flights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A potentially more dangerous problem remains at the Trojan site:  
hundreds of highly radioactive spent fuel rods. Since the federal 
government has yet to build a disposal site for such waste, PGE has 
no option but to encase the rods in canisters and leave them there.

<P>
	CHAUTAUQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- They were looking for a ride to nowhere,  
some good scenery, a modest adventure. They did not expect to find 
Shangri-La. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard and Lorene Bowles left their home in Cleveland 11 years  
ago and drove northeast on Route 90, across the corner of 
Pennsylvania and into New York. They saw a sign for Chautauqua, and 
found it on the map. 
</P>
<P>
	A lake. This should be nice.  
</P>
<P>
	And so they paid their fee and went through the gate and fell in  
love -- deeply, completely, forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, there was a lake at the edge of these leafy 225 acres. But  
there was also ballet and music and theater and opera. There were 
lectures on religion, philosophy and the great issues of the day. 
There were classes on personal finance, astronomy, jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	And scurrying amid Victorian houses, Richard and Lorene found  
more than 7,000 kindred spirits who would rather ponder 
``Millennialism and Western Culture'' than don mouse ears and visit 
Tomorrowland. 
</P>
<P>
	They've been back every summer since.

<P>

lecture. You don't want to miss anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For nine weeks each summer, more than 140,000 people come to the  
Chautauqua Institution. Among them are neurosurgeons, lawyers and 
ministers, but also tool-and-die makers and homemakers, like the 
Bowles. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the America that is queuing up to see ``American  
Pie,'' or perusing WWF Magazine, or organizing its days around 
``Jerry Springer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This America is filling museums and traipsing to Elderhostels.  
It is following Oprah Winfrey's lead and reading and discussing 
books like Toni Morrison's ``Beloved'' and Jacquelyn Mitchard's 
``The Deep End of the Ocean.'' It is logging onto the Cafe Utne 
site on the World Wide Web to discuss ``What is forgiveness?'' 
</P>
<P>
	This America is not the majority. But it was a major force in  
the 19th century, and today it is growing again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like an undercurrent or a subculture,'' says  
Donald Biffen, a dentist from Stroudsburg, Pa., after hearing the 
Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra perform Chopin's ``Piano Concerto No. 
1 in E minor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be the main culture but it's been submerged by  
television. People are tired of the glossing over of some things, 
of being spoon-fed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biffen takes part in Civil War reenactments -- not because he  
likes the guns and uniforms, but because ``I'm always learning 
something new, something more than the Hollywood version.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Says Eric Utne, founder of the eponymous magazine, salons and  
Web site: ``People crave interaction and connection around ideas. 
Increasingly, people find they want to get together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is why, after 125 years, Chautauqua still thrives.  
</P>
<P>
	That, and the sheer charm of the place. At Chautauqua, each  
morning begins at 8 a.m. with a carillon playing ``Morning has 
Broken.'' Newsboys walk down carless streets, chanting, 
``Chay-TAU-qua DAI-ly, 40 CENTS!'' The grand hotel, the Athenaeum, 
offers everyone a second dessert-- to make up for the fact that no 
liquor is served, here or elsewhere on the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	(Of course, during the season, alcohol sales in nearby Mayville  
increase 100 percent.) 
</P>
<P>
	Chautauqua is ``wholesome ... a less tense, less self-consumed,  
slightly more cerebral world ...,'' says historian David 
McCullough. ``It has the virtues of much that once was commonplace 
in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was commonplace in the 19th century, during what was known as  
the lyceum movement, when hundreds of towns large and small set up 
lecture halls. Shopkeepers would put away their aprons, farmers 
would hitch up their rigs, and they would gather to listen. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were going to be an independent person, you not only  
needed an education, you had a right to education,'' says Jeffrey 
Simpson, author of ``Chautauqua: An American Utopia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lyceum movement died with the Civil War. And then two men --  
John H. Vincent, later bishop of what was then known as the 
Methodist Episcopal Church, and Lewis Miller, an Ohio industrialist 
-- hit upon the idea of an annual assembly to train Sunday school 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	They settled on Lake Chautauqua in western New York, site of a  
camp meeting -- a euphoric, ecstatic Christian gathering. But 
Vincent and Miller wanted education, with time for recreation. 
</P>
<P>
	Summer vacation was a new thing in the 19th century, McCullough  
notes. But it was ``not just to be frittered away with fun and 
games. One could improve one's education. One could enlarge one's 
sense of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The country was built on hard work,'' he says, and Chautauqua  
was a place where hard-working Americans could vacation without 
guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	The accommodations were rustic -- tents, some cottages and an  
open shed that served as a hotel -- but that was no impediment: 
Between 10,000 and 15,000 people attended the first two-week 
session, in 1874. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was,'' Vincent would say, ``a hunger of mind abroad in  
the land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, even more people came, President Ulysses S. Grant  
among them. The year after, the Sunday School Assembly bought the 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Chautauqua never lost its religious soul, but its classes and  
lectures soon became more secular. People flocked to learn Latin 
and German, to hear lectures on the constellations, electricity and 
that controversial theory, evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Chautauqua, Theodore Roosevelt said, was ``typically American,  
in that it is typical of America at its best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone loved the place; to some, it was -- and is --  
middlebrow and bland. Psychologist William James, after a week's 
stay, lamented ``this unspeakable Chautauqua.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This order is too tame, this culture too second-rate, this  
goodness too uninspiring ... this atrocious harmlessness of all 
things, I cannot abide with them,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in the minority. Towns created their own Chautauquas; by  
1904, there were nearly 300. After 1907, traveling Chautauquas 
blossomed, setting up tents and offering lectures and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle --  
the CLSC, established in 1878, ancestor of all of today's book 
clubs. More than 300,000 people had joined by the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
	Members, all across the country, were asked to read 12 books  
over four years -- history, philosophy, biography, science, poetry 
and more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just opened new worlds for people,'' says Simpson. He  
quotes a letter from one woman who had fallen behind in her 
membership duties: 
</P>
<P>
	``I live on a farm, and my husband has no help except what I  
give him. All of the time I am not doing housework, I am obliged to 
drive the horse at the horsepower. ... I have done my reading while 
driving the horse for the past two months, but I cannot write while 
driving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Circle survives. Richard and Lorene Bowles have read all 12  
books, and are now in the process of reading 14 more books so they 
can advance to the next level, The Guild of the Seven Seals. 
</P>
<P>
	(``Yes, we have a talent for names,'' one Chautauquan says  
wryly.) 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, the Bowles come back for CLSC Recognition Day, when  
graduates are feted in the time-honored fashion: They march through 
a golden gate to the Parthenon-like Hall of Philosophy, children 
showering flower petals in their path. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bowles are 57, at the low end of the 55-to-75 age group that  
is Chautauqua's largest segment. Chautauqua once was known as ``a 
place where old ladies took their mothers,'' says Jeffrey Simpson, 
and humorist Mark Russell once referred to the Athenaeum Hotel as 
``God's waiting room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a few years ago, the Athenaeum's dining room got its first  
high chairs. These days, you see a lot of young families at 
Chautauqua. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelly Burns, 33, has been coming here since she was a child,  
and now she brings her 2-year-old twins, Emily and Drew. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun to expose them to a few minutes of the concerts'' in  
the big, open-air Amphitheater, she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Chautauqua still draws well-known speakers and performers, and  
they still mix and chat with the public. Winnie Lewellen runs the 
Wensley House, where these guests often stay, and she is eager to 
page through a guestbook that includes Buster Crabbe and Stephen 
Jay Gould, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge and Victor Borge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isaac Stern pinched my fanny!'' she exclaims, laughing  
uproariously. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chautauqua is no longer the national podium it was in the  
late 19th century, or in 1936, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
delivered his famous ``I Hate War'' speech in the Amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Bratton wants to regain that status. But Chautauqua's  
president knows that it must be a different kind of podium in the 
21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	He talks about a conference next February on ``God at 2000,''  
which will be uplinked and downlinked to 500 schools and other 
centers. He looks forward to collaborations on radio and television 
and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Next March, Chautauqua will stage a four-day program on family  
at the Disney Institute in Florida, an adult-education complex 
which was itself inspired by Chautauqua. 
</P>
<P>
	The Disney Institute offers classes in cooking and gardening,  
but it also offers job-related training. That is where the great 
growth in adult education has come, says James H. Ryan, vice 
president for outreach and cooperative extension at Penn State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chautauqua movement was for a small, select, elite  
group,'' he says. ``What we have done now is taken that to the 
public. If you can make their lives better -- if you can help them 
put food on the table -- then they can take the time to enjoy the 
arts and great books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bratton does not shy away from the e-word. ``Yup, we're elitist,  
in the sense of intellectual curiosity and artistic achievement,'' 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chautauquans are comfortable with their elitism. They love  
ideas and art, and they adore this place. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chautauqua people are real believers,'' says David  
McCullough. ``Their love for the place is quite lovable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every Sunday, Ross Mackenzie -- director of Chautauqua's  
Department of Religion -- leads services in the Amphitheater. At one 
point, he asks all newcomers to Chautauqua to stand up; he welcomes 
them, and proclaims them Chautauquans for life. They will be back, 
he says. Everyone comes back. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the beginning, there was the word,'' Mackenzie would later  
say. ``And the word was Chautauqua.''

<HEADLINE> Club Opens 'Oz' Conference in Pa. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- It may not have a yellow brick road, but  
Pennsylvania's capital has the spirit of Judy Garland and the 
``Wizard of Oz'' this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 people are expected for a three-day conference that  
started Friday and features appearances by two of the original 
Munchkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the conference, one of three regional meetings sponsored  
by the International Wizard of Oz Club, focuses on all aspects of 
the Oz legacy, the 60th anniversary of the film's release is 
prompting a special emphasis on the 1939 film. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference features an auction and sale of Oz memorabilia, a  
costume contest and a short story contest for writers inspired by 
the 40 books written in the Oz series from 1900 to 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is much discussion about the contributions of the series  
to the nature of fantasy and interpretations of the books as 
discussions of quests for self-identity,'' said Peter Hanff, the 
club's president.

<HEADLINE> Rodriguez Sparks Yankee-Mariner Brawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The New York Yankees knew what to expect when  
Frankie Rodriguez stood on the mound and Jose Mesa was watching 
from the bullpen in the ninth inning for the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	After New York's Jason Grimsley was ejected the previous inning  
for hitting Edgar Martinez, Rodriguez -- who triggered a brawl at 
Dodger Stadium last month by throwing a pitch at Mark 
Grudzielanek's head -- took the mound to start the ninth Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mesa is pitching that ninth inning, no doubt about it,'' New  
York's Chad Curtis said. ``OK, all of a sudden, Mesa's not out 
there. Rodriguez is back out there. So they left Rodriguez out 
there so he could get tossed instead of Mesa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, who was claimed off the waiver wire by the  
pitching-short Mariners on May 26, became the focal point of 
Seattle's second on-the-field fight in less than a month on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	In an 11-8 victory by New York, he hit the Yankees' second  
batter in the ninth, Chuck Knoblauch, with a pitch and then, after 
being taken out by manager Lou Piniella, went after New York 
catcher Joe Girardi, who was the next batter. 
</P>
<P>
	The benches and bullpens emptied with some of the Yankees intent  
to get Rodriguez, who knocked Girardi down with two punches. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you watch the replay, you'll see (Mariners catcher Dan)  
Wilson on the first pitch to Chuck tap his hands on the grounds 
like give me the curveball in the dirt this time so that he can hit 
him with the second pitch fastball,'' Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He throws second-pitch fastball and it hits him in the rear  
end. If his manager tells him to hit a guy, you hit him in the rear 
end. The guy did his job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't end there because the Yankees were up and screaming in  
their dugout for plate umpire Gary Cederstrom to throw Rodriguez 
out, too. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Derek Jeter did not play Friday night after being hit  
in the left wrist by a pitch by Jose Paniagua in Thursday night's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They instigated it,'' Piniella said. ``It was their pitcher  
that hit Edgar after he gave up a home run (to Alex Rodriguez) and 
it was obvious and it was blatant. What are we supposed to do? We 
did what we had to do and hit one of their players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piniella said the Mariners didn't hit Jeter on purpose.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is no connection,'' he said. ``There should be no  
connection at all. Jeter wasn't hit intentionally. Edgar was hit 
intentionally. It was obvious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez did some screaming at the Yankees as he was leaving  
the field, too. The screaming escalated into his charging Girardi. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he should have done was just go off the field,'' Curtis  
said. ``He did his job. He did what he was supposed to do. He had 
the respect of his team and he had the respect of our team for 
doing that. Why didn't he just go off the field? You don't need to 
incite anything by screaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the melee that followed, Safeco Field's first brawl since  
replacing the Kingdome as the Mariners' home July 15, Yankees coach 
Don Zimmer, 68, fell to the ground and then stumbled to his feet, 
looking dazed. 
</P>
<P>
	And Bernie Williams, the Yankees' center fielder who hit one of  
four homers off Mariners starter Jeff Fassero, broke loose of 
Wilson and chased Rodriguez to the Seattle dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't get up,'' said Zimmer, who almost left the team  
earlier this season because of chronic knee problems. ``My leg gave 
out on me and hurt a little bit and I was out of breath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No players were injured seriously in the fight. The Mariners  
lost Brian Hunter and Charles Gipson, both outfielders, with 
injuries in the Dodgers' brawl. In that game, Mariners Jay Buhner, 
Damaso Marte, Mesa and Paniagua were ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday night's fight, Zimmer and Girardi were ejected.  
Afterward, Girardi was not in a forgiving mood. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Rodriguez) tried to hurt me and I'm not going to going to  
forget it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre watched the brawl on TV from his  
office after tossed by first-base umpire Doug Eddings in the eighth 
for arguing too strongly on a play at first. He held his breath. 
</P>
<P>
	``You talk about ending careers. It could happen in a  
heartbeat,'' Torre said. ``It was really ugly, but I guess ESPN 
will have something to lead with.''

<HEADLINE> Oolong, Campbell Wins Oaks Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Oolong came roaring down the  
stretch today to give Hall of Fame driver John Campbell his first 
win in the $500,000 Hambletonian Oaks at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, who has won five Hambletonians, took his first Oaks by  
swinging Oolong wide at the top of the stretch and letting her pass 
five fillies for a 1 1/2-length win in a career-best 1:54.4. 
</P>
<P>
	Loveelytobehold set the early pace through relatively slow early  
fraction of 28.3 seconds and 56.4 before being caught by the 
$16,000 purchase out of Armbro Goal by China Tea. 
</P>
<P>
	The Per Hendricksen-trained filly, paid $5.40, $3.80 and $3 as  
the favorite. Lovelytobehold held second while Bit O Candy finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	French Panicure won the $400,000 Mistletoe Shalee pace for  
3-year old fillies with a late burst of speed that carried her past 
Beach Crystal and Marfa Hanover to a length victory in a career 
best 1:50.4. 
</P>
<P>
	Driven by George Brennan, trained by Brett Pelling and owned by  
Bob Glazer, French Penicure was third in the top of the stretch 
before closing. She paid $17 to increase her lifetime earnings to 
$338,814. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Bow Tie swung three-wide and came charging down the stretch  
for Luc Ouellette to successfully defend the $131,000 U.S. Pacing 
championship in 1:48.4. He paid $4.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Galleria ($8.60) took an early lead and set a world  
record of 1:49.1 in winning the $100,000 invitational for mares 
with Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
	In the $424,000 Nat Ray Final, a one mile free for all trot,  
Magician held off a late bid by Supergrit to win by a half length 
in 1:52.4. The Earl Cruise-trained gelding was driven by David 
Miller and paid $18.20.

<HEADLINE> Diet Drug Award May Spur More Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Texas (AP) -- A jury's $23 million award to a woman who  
blamed her heart problems on the diet drug combination fen-phen 
should encourage thousands of others who have sued the drug's 
makers, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will let them know the fen-phen users with serious injuries  
will be seen by juries as having solid cases,'' Darrell Keith, a 
Fort Worth trial attorney familiar with the fen-phen cases, said 
Friday. ``I think it's definitely enough to bring about corrective 
justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, more than 3,100 people have sued American Home  
Products and subsidiary Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories over health 
problems allegedly caused by the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Debbie Lovett's case was the first to reach a verdict. At least  
a dozen cases have been settled, some after trial began. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lovett said she suffered heart-valve problems after taking  
the drugs for more than three months, starting in October 1995. Her 
attorney said she suffers fatigue and shortness of breath and 
likely will need surgery to replace two heart valves as her ailment 
progresses. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated Wednesday, deep into the night Thursday and  
about two hours Friday before determining the company was liable 
for Ms. Lovett's heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a statement that they can't do this to people,'' Ms.  
Lovett said. ``What that company has done makes you lose faith in a 
lot of things. Maybe they'll learn their lesson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The award includes $2 million for her physical impairment and  
future medical care and $20 million in punitive damages. The rest 
compensates her for pain, mental anguish and past medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say this is a beacon,'' said Washington, D.C.,  
attorney Michael Hausfeld, who is representing plaintiffs in a 
class-action lawsuit against American Home in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``American Home was clearly of the impression that they were  
going to prevail. And that makes the loss that much more 
significant. They chose a battle that they didn't win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Tommy Wallace must approve the award. A ruling is expected  
within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home attorney Bob Schick said the company will appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is just one jury's opinion,'' he said. ``Through  
sympathy, they wanted to award money to Ms. Lovett and they 
answered the jury questions accordingly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lovett's attorneys said the company hid evidence that the  
drug combination caused heart valve damage, and encouraged jurors 
to award a judgment large enough to punish American Home. The 
company reported second-quarter profits of $399 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sold Pondimin, the brand name for fenfluramine, the  
``fen'' part of the fen-phen combination, and its chemical cousin 
Redux until September 1997. That was when the Food and Drug 
Administration pushed for their withdrawal, citing a study that 
linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart-valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenfluramine had been sold since the 1970s but became widely  
used in the 1990s when doctors prescribed it in combination with 
phentermine, which is made by another company. When taken alone, 
phentermine never was associated with health problems, and it 
remains on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Madison, N.J.-based American Home argued that Ms.  
Lovett was seeking compensation for a health condition she had 
before taking the drug and said her weight was a bigger threat than 
the drug.

<HEADLINE> Browns' Couch Ready for Prime Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Whether it was as a Kentucky high school  
football sensation or as the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, Tim Couch 
has always been in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	But never in one as bright as he'll step into Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``My first game in the NFL,'' said the Cleveland Browns rookie  
quarterback. ``To me, it's like the Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio, against the  
Dallas Cowboys is like the Super Bowl to all of Cleveland, which 
has waited three years for the Browns' return. And when the Browns 
take the field for the first time, a new football era will dawn in 
football-mad Northeast Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans here are unbelievable,'' Couch said. ``Their support  
before we've even played a game has been unreal. This is an 
exciting time for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Cleveland, it's more than an exhibition opener. It's  
history. 
</P>
<P>
	For the new Browns, the game will be gauge of how far they've  
come in two weeks of training camp, and how far they'll need to go 
to get ready for the Pittsburgh Steelers in the regular-season 
opener Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have butterflies right now,'' said Browns coach Chris  
Palmer, who like Couch, will be making his NFL debut. ``Hopefully, 
we'll be organized, have our heads in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch is the Browns QB of the future, and he'll come into  
Monday's game after Ty Detmer, the QB of the present, runs 12 to 15 
plays with the first-team offense. Couch will then work with the 
first unit, and play the second half of the second quarter with the 
second team. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll remain in the game for part of the third quarter before  
third-stringer Mike Cook takes over. Palmer asked Couch and Detmer 
to give him a list of 10 or 12 plays each feels comfortable 
running. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some fairly aggressive plays,'' Couch said, ``and  
there are some real high-percentage plays just to get me started. 
Hopefully, we can get a couple of deep passes in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns have $59.4 million and seven years invested in Couch,  
and they're eager to see how their franchise player has developed. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch has been impressive. Like every rookie, he was initially  
overwhelmed and seemed to have trouble adjusting to the speed of 
the pro game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hand the ball off and you look back and see a big hole  
open up and how quickly it closes is phenomenal,'' he said. ``It 
looks like a play is going for 40 yards, and ... Bam! Here comes 
somebody to make the play at the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said his confidence is growing by the day, and it shows.  
He looks poised under pressure and has shown he can improvise, 
sidestepping rushers to sidearm passes or looking off a covered 
receiver and throwing to his secondary target. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first day of training camp the guys were just flying by  
me, everything was so fast here. Now everything has slowed down 
just a little bit where I can settle in and make the throws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a recent scrimmage, Couch, tripped while backpedaling by  
one of his offensive guards, completed a 15-yard pass down field 
while laying flat on his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's looked good,'' Palmer said. ``He's worked hard and  
continues make good progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch has been working overtime to be ready for the day he's  
called upon to lead the Browns for good. He spends hours after 
practice going over the Browns' thick playbook. 
</P>
<P>
	He studies a play, traces the passing routes over in his  
notebook. Studies it, and then does it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike some of the other rookie quarterbacks around the league  
who have held out, Couch came to camp signed and ready to play. He 
thinks that has helped him focus, and may have won him some fans 
among his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``With me being here on time, it went over well with guys,'' he  
said. ``I've been here working hard and just trying to fit in. And 
I think they've just accepted me as a regular guy.''

<HEADLINE> Indian Actor Silverheels Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Jay Silverheels, the Lone Ranger's  
poker-faced sidekick ``Tonto,'' has been inducted into the Western 
New York Entertainment Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The late American Indian performer from Ontario's Six Nations  
Reserve went to Hollywood in 1933 by way of Buffalo, where he had 
been an Eastern State Golden Gloves boxing champion and runner-up 
for the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverheels was a far different man than the character he  
portrayed in the 1950s television series, family members said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My greatest pride is the fact that he played the role of Tonto  
very well -- because he wasn't the type of person who would be 
subservient to anyone unless the script called for it,'' an uncle, 
Leslie Smith of Fort Erie, Ontario, told guests at Thursday's 
induction ceremony.

<HEADLINE> De Niro Fan Names Eatery After Actor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- For years, restaurateur Salli  
Pateman has worshipped Robert De Niro. She's even named her hip 
Yaletown restaurant DeNiro's Supper Club in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
	A creaky black swivel chair in her office has been specially  
reserved for him in hopes he'll come in for a martini or maybe for 
Sunday brunch to sample the Vito Corleone or the Jake LaMotta or 
the Travis Bickle -- eggs benedict variations named after characters 
De Niro played in Godfather II, Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Now her loyalty is being tested. Pateman says she has received a  
letter from De Niro's lawyer telling her to stop using his name, 
citing a section of the British Columbia Privacy Act. The letter 
threatened legal action against her if she doesn't, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely serious,'' said Pateman, who doesn't want  
to change the name of her restaurant. ``So much for him coming in 
to dine in his sacred chair.''

<HEADLINE> Self Possessed Wins $1M Hambletonian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Self Possessed recorded the fastest  
trotting mile in winning the Hambletonian on Saturday, giving 
driver Mike Lachance and trainer Ron Gurfein their third victory 
since 1994 in trotting's biggest race. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed came into the $1 million race at the Meadowlands  
Racetrack as the prohibitive favorite, and the 3-year-old son of 
Victory Dream didn't disappoint, covering the mile 1:51.3. 
</P>
<P>
	The time broke the trotting world record of 1:51.4 set by Beat  
The Wheel, a 4-year-old mare, in 1994 at the Meadowlands. It also 
shattered the Hambletonian stakes record of 1:52.1 set in a 1996 
elimination by another Gurfein-Lachance winner, Continentalvictory. 
She came back in the final to win in 1:52.2, the fastest time in a 
Hambo final. 
</P>
<P>
	Gurfein and Lachance's first win came with Victory Dream.  
</P>
<P>
	Angus Hall, driven by five-time Hambletonian winner John  
Campbell, finished a distant second, 5 1/2 lengths behind. Enjoy Lavec 
was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed paid $2.80, $2.40 and $2.10 as part of a  
three-horse entry that included Angus Hall and Raffaello Ambrosio. 
Enjoy Lavec, whose trainer Jimmy Takter is appealing a one-year 
suspension for having an illegal substance in a detention barn, was 
$2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed, who had the fastest time in last weekend's  
eliminations, broke from the No. 4 post position in the field of 10 
colts and really didn't get away great although the colt was in 
good position by the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell had gotten Angus Hall, the other elimination winner,  
out of the No. 9 post fast and by the time the leaders reached the 
first turn, Angus Hall, Pearsall Hanover and Self Possessed were 
near the front. 
</P>
<P>
	Lachance played hardball with Campbell and forced Angus Hall  
three-wide but Campbell got to the lead as the field reached the 
backstretch after a 27.2 first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed didn't stay behind long and Lachance put him on  
the lead halfway down the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
	CR Renegade, who beat Self Possessed in the Beacon Course Trot  
final a month ago, made a bold challenge as Self Possessed reached 
the final turn. For a split second, it appeared Rod Allen and CR 
Renegade would take the lead, but Lachance asked Self Possessed for 
more and the colt gave it to him. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the stretch, Self Possessed had a 2 1/2 length lead  
and he was never challenged in the stretch, with Lachance letting 
him drift out just so he would not break stride. 
</P>
<P>
	Raffaello Ambrosio finished fourth and was followed by Cherry  
Hills, Comets Tail, Davanti, Pearsall Hanover, CR Renegade and CR 
Commando, who broke early in denying 69-year-old trainer-driver 
Carl Allen his first Hambletonian win. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell scored his first victory in the Hambletonian Oaks just  
two races before the colt final, rallying favored Oolong in the 
stretch for a 1 1/2 length win over Lovelytobehold. The 3-year-old 
daughter of Armbro Goal out of China Tea trotted the mile in 
1:54.4.

<HEADLINE> Winfield Excels At Corner for Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Bills didn't hear the whispers  
that 5-foot-8 Antoine Winfield was too small to play cornerback in 
the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, they're glad their hearing wasn't real sharp.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bills' top draft choice and Thorpe Award winner as the  
nation's top defensive back has stood taller than his critics, not 
to mention a few receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a natural at corner,'' Bills safety and eight-year  
veteran Kurt Schulz said in training camp Saturday. ``He's quick 
and aggressive, he's smooth. He can play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winfield was one of the top deep coverage defenders in college  
and a hard hitter who could help stop the run and also blitz. 
Drafted 23rd overall behind Georgia's Champ Bailey and Arizona's 
Chris McAlister, Winfield already has shown the Bills almost 
everything, except for one thing -- hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's only because there has been none of that allowed yet,  
to Winfield's disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we should have done some tackling before we had our  
first preseason game at Seattle next weekend,'' Winfield said after 
Saturday's non-contact scrimmage. ``But that's up to the coaches. 
I'm just here to do what they want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the Bills want is for Winfield to provide the kind of deep  
coverage that allowed him to take a top receiver out of the game 
all by himself. 
</P>
<P>
	They also expect him to provide run support. Winfield had 75  
stops and two sacks for the Buckeyes in 1998, coming off a 
100-tackle season in 1997. ``He's the best overall cornerback I've 
ever had,'' OSU coach John Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically in college I was known for tackling,'' Winfield  
said. ``They want me more as a cover man up here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of height doesn't add up to lack of might in Winfield's  
case. ``That's not a factor,'' he said. ``I'm a ballplayer. I can 
match up with these guys. I'm doing pretty well, no complaints from 
the coaches. I'm not worried about the height issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winfield and Tennessee standout Peerless Price, the Buffalo  
Bills' top draft picks, needed no introduction at training camp. 
They both grew up in Ohio, Winfield in Akron and Price in Dayton, 
and they met in a high school all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
	They also met in the Citrus Bowl after the 1995 season when both  
were freshmen. The Vols beat Ohio State 20-14. ``He's a good 
corner,'' Price said. ``He has quick feet and is able to backpedal 
really fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Irvin, who finally nailed down a full-time position as a  
starter at left cornerback last season following the departure of 
free agent Jeff Burris, knows all about the tough challenges 
Winfield faces. 
</P>
<P>
	``At Ohio State, people really weren't coming at him,'' Irvin  
said. ``In this league, nobody's really fearful of going at 
corners, so he's going to get balls caught on him and he has to 
come back from those and not get in a slump. But he has all the 
tools, no question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winfield's weaknesses, besides his alleged lack of height, are  
said to be that he tends to bite on play action, and doesn't always 
find the ball instinctively. He did not intercept a pass in his 
last season at OSU. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's meeting his challenges face-to-face, literally. ``You  
have to get your hands on these receivers; they'll run right by 
you, and the quarterbacks put the ball right there,'' Winfield 
said. ``I'm kind of getting used to how fast the game is and 
receivers' routes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winfield, whose five-year $7 million contract includes a  
$3.5-million signing bonus, is settling in. He quickly bought a 
house in Orchard Park, where the Bills play. 
</P>
<P>
	He's just a few hours down the turnpike from his family in  
Akron. He has a son and is engaged, but hasn't set a date for the 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not quite ready yet,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Oregon Nuke Reactor Heads to Burial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A pair of tugboats chugged up the Columbia  
River on Saturday hauling a 1,000-ton nuclear reactor to a burial 
site, escorted by a Coast Guard cutter keeping other boats 300 
yards away from the radioactive hulk. 
</P>
<P>
	The barge carrying the empty reactor vessel had been floated  
past Portland during the night, the first time a commercial reactor 
of that size and level of contamination had passed so near a major 
American city, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far it's been smooth sailing,'' said Kregg Arntson,  
spokesman for Portland General Electric, the utility 
decommissioning the largest commercial reactor ever taken off line 
in United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The dumbbell-shaped vessel is destined for the Hanford Nuclear  
Reservation in central Washington, where it will be buried 42 feet 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
	After a voyage that began Friday at the dismantled Trojan  
Nuclear Plant 40 miles west of Portland, the barge was to stop 
Saturday night at Pasco, Wash., so the remaining 10 miles of the 
river could be traveled in daylight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stretch between Pasco and Benton (Wash.) is uncharted,''  
Arntson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The channel, however, is marked and safe for passage, though it  
doesn't see a lot of river traffic, said Coast Guard Lt. Tom Allan. 
</P>
<P>
	PGE already has shipped Trojan's contaminated steam generators  
upriver to Hanford since 1995, and the Navy often ships reactors 
from submarines and cruisers up the Columbia for burial at the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it no longer contains its uranium fuel, the Trojan  
reactor contains 15 times as much radioactivity as those objects, 
according to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
	After being filled with concrete and encased in 6-inch thick  
steel, the reactor is considered safe for shipment. Workers 
handling it wear no more protection than a hard hat. 
</P>
<P>
	From Benton, the reactor vessel will be hauled 15 miles on a  
320-wheel trailer to the Hanford reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trojan plant operated for 16 years, generating enough  
electricity to supply all of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	It was shut down in 1993, two decades earlier than planned,  
after a series of problems including a faulty safety system that 
drew federal fines, an accidental release of radioactive gases and 
cracked steam tubes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 800 spent but highly radioactive uranium fuel rod  
assemblies removed from the reactor over the years remain in 
storage at the Trojan site.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Hooligans Use Web for Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARDIFF, Wales (AP) -- The English soccer season got off to a  
violent start as fans of division two clubs, Cardiff City and 
Millwall, fought in the city today after apparently arranging the 
clashes via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen people were hurt and six arrested during a day of  
violence as Cardiff followers fought some of the 700 Millwall 
supporters who went to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	According to police, shoppers cowered in terror as rival gangs  
of hooligans battled in the center of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	An Internet bulletin board contained a number of references to  
the Cardiff City-Millwall match, including details of where the 
violence would start and even a running commentary on the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	One message said the fighting had begun and added, ``Don't miss  
the tear-up of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another suggested a rendezvous for any hooligans looking for a  
fight: ``11 o'clock Cardiff Central, where we go from there its up 
to u.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the National Criminal Intelligence Service  
published its annual report, which highlighted the dangers posed by 
organized gangs of thugs using the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which showed the first rise in the number of arrests  
for soccer hooliganism in six years, said violent fans were 
becoming more organized.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Boxer Wins Gold at Pan Am </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Gerald Tucker stood on the medal  
stand, a notch above the other top finishers, and it was there that 
his achievement took a tug at his emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was coming onto me that I had won a gold medal. It was  
coming slowly but surely, and I was feeling it,'' said Tucker, who 
put his hand over his mouth as his eyes got teary. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt this is my biggest win ever. I'll never forget this,  
not for the rest of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker, of Cincinnati, scored a lopsided 15-3 victory Friday  
night over Venezuela's Neouar Cermeno in the bantamweight finals on 
a night when Cuban boxers claimed five gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Cuban victories came at the expense of American  
Arthur Palac, who lost the middleweight championship to a 
showboating Yohason Martinez of Cuba 12-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more U.S. boxers, flyweight Jose Navarro of Los Angeles and  
super heavyweight Davin King of Temple Hills, Md., will go after 
gold medals tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker, 20, was as surprised as anyone that the score was so  
one-sided against his taller opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my hands up, but I was like running into a lot of shots.  
I don't know if it was knocking my head back or not. But I know I 
was feeling punches in there, more than three. So I didn't think it 
was lopsided,'' Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	An Olympic alternate in 1996, Tucker finished second in two  
other tournaments this year. His nerves were racing as he prepared 
for the fight of his life. Then he let his quickness and instincts 
take over. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 165-pound Palac had to contend with Martinez, who  
danced around the ring with his hands down most of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically his style is typical of a Cuban boxer who is kind of  
cocky,'' Palac said. ``He was a little cocky and I let that take 
control of me a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palac, of Hamtramck, Mich., was bothered by a sore shoulder, but  
said winning the silver medal has prepared him for Olympic 
qualifying. He'd like another shot at Martinez in about 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just wait until I meet him in 2000 at Sydney,'' Palac  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban Maikro Romero beat Mexico's Liboria Romero 8-4 to win the  
light flyweight gold. And in the lightweight title match, Cuba's 
Mario Kindelan scored with a left jab in the final 15 seconds to 
edge Canadian Dana Laframboise 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian welterweight Jeremy Molitor lost a tough decision to  
1996 Olympic silver medalist Juan Hernandez. The score was tied 1-1 
after four rounds, so it was decided on a punch callback, in which 
the scores of the two judges who have awarded the most and least 
blows are thrown out. The number of blows recorded by the three 
remaining judges are then added and Hernandez was declared a 19-7 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban heavyweight Odlaniel Solis made it a near-sweep with a 4-2  
win over Mark Simmons of Canada.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Gives Gore Campaign Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore may be concerned  
about being perceived as too close to a president who was 
impeached, but that is not stopping him from using Bill Clinton's 
fund-raising prowess to boost his White House hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton lavished praise on Gore at a Saturday night fund-raiser  
for the Gore 2000 presidential campaign committee, the first of a 
series of such events featuring the president. He also will attend 
four Gore fund-raisers in the nation's capital, two next week and 
two on Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been with this man in every conceivable kind of  
circumstance,'' Clinton said. ``I know him as few people do. If 
everything was on the line and I had to pick an American to make a 
decision ... I would pick Al Gore, and so should you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there's a real friend for you,'' Gore said. He pitched an  
agenda heavy on improving health care and education, then made his 
own shameless appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need your help,'' Gore said. ``I need your vote. I want your  
vote, your support, and everything you can do to convince people to 
be for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During an outreach meeting with about 200 black ministers prior  
to the fund-raiser, Clinton promised to help Gore unconditionally, 
in part to repay the loyalty Gore showed during the impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time now, he's been at my back, and I intend to be  
with his,'' Clinton said. He called Gore ``a good and decent man,'' 
and predicted Gore would go down in history as one of most 
influential vice presidents to ever hold the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``An election is a job interview. He wants you to hire him,''  
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do, I do,'' Gore interjected amid peals of laughter.  
</P>
<P>
	``And all of these other people that are running are perfectly  
nice people, but all of them are saying, 'Hire us too, we want to 
be president, and sooner or later we'll get around to telling you 
why,''' Clinton continued. ``You already know more about him than 
anybody else running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's dinner at the State House Convention Center drew  
about 500 of Arkansas' most influential Democrats, with each asked 
to contribute at least $500. Other scheduled speakers included Sen. 
Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark.; U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney 
Slater and Arkansas Attorney General Mark Pryor. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, Gore has told associates he had felt the drag of  
Clinton's impeachment on attempts to get his own campaign in gear 
during the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign officials said last week they were confident the  
public was well past any unease about Clinton and his personal 
behavior. But it was clear Saturday that public pairings of Clinton 
and Gore were planned carefully so they would not come across as a 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president arrived in Little Rock separately from  
Clinton, flying in from Chicago where he was speaking to a meeting 
of the Rainbow Coalition. Clinton and Gore were appearing together 
for a private meeting with farmers and African-American ministers 
before the fund-raising dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	They met with about 75 farmers at a coffee house near the  
Arkansas River, shedding their blue jackets while they chatted with 
the casually dressed farmers about an array of problems, including 
subsidized rice from Japan and subsidized cotton from China. Both 
crops are grown in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proclaimed the current farm bill ``badly broken'' and  
Clinton said he would try to keep Congress in session all year if 
necessary to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign has stressed that the president plays no  
hands-on role in stump strategy -- even as the campaign takes 
advantage of Clinton's ability to invigorate Democrats in the face 
of a primary challenge from Sen. Bill Bradley, and the possibility 
of a tough race against the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Clinton strategist Paul Begala, who is supporting Gore  
from the sidelines, said Gore only stands to benefit from having 
Clinton in his corner, in terms of fund raising and putting the 
full force of presidential power behind Gore's policy ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people are going to say, 'Clinton cheated on his  
wife, so let's go back to Reaganomics and give more tax cuts to the 
rich,''' Begala said. ``And that's exactly what the other side, the 
Republicans would do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Bradley team watched Gore and Clinton with little  
noticeable interest. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Gives Gore Campaign Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore may be concerned  
about being perceived as too close to a president who was 
impeached, but that is not stopping him from using Bill Clinton's 
fund-raising prowess to boost his White House hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton lavished praise on Gore at a Saturday night fund-raiser  
for the Gore 2000 presidential campaign committee, the first of a 
series of such events featuring the president. He also will attend 
four Gore fund-raisers in the nation's capital, two next week and 
two on Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been with this man in every conceivable kind of  
circumstance,'' Clinton said. ``I know him as few people do. If 
everything was on the line and I had to pick an American to make a 
decision ... I would pick Al Gore, and so should you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there's a real friend for you,'' Gore said. He pitched an  
agenda heavy on improving health care and education, then made his 
own shameless appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need your help,'' Gore said. ``I need your vote. I want your  
vote, your support, and everything you can do to convince people to 
be for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During an outreach meeting with about 200 black ministers prior  
to the fund-raiser, Clinton promised to help Gore unconditionally, 
in part to repay the loyalty Gore showed during the impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time now, he's been at my back, and I intend to be  
with his,'' Clinton said. He called Gore ``a good and decent man,'' 
and predicted Gore would go down in history as one of most 
influential vice presidents to ever hold the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``An election is a job interview. He wants you to hire him,''  
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do, I do,'' Gore interjected amid peals of laughter.  
</P>
<P>
	``And all of these other people that are running are perfectly  
nice people, but all of them are saying, 'Hire us too, we want to 
be president, and sooner or later we'll get around to telling you 
why,''' Clinton continued. ``You already know more about him than 
anybody else running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's dinner at the State House Convention Center drew  
about 500 of Arkansas' most influential Democrats, with each asked 
to contribute at least $500. Other scheduled speakers included Sen. 
Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark.; U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney 
Slater and Arkansas Attorney General Mark Pryor. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, Gore has told associates he had felt the drag of  
Clinton's impeachment on attempts to get his own campaign in gear 
during the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign officials said last week they were confident the  
public was well past any unease about Clinton and his personal 
behavior. But it was clear Saturday that public pairings of Clinton 
and Gore were planned carefully so they would not come across as a 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president arrived in Little Rock separately from  
Clinton, flying in from Chicago where he was speaking to a meeting 
of the Rainbow Coalition. Clinton and Gore were appearing together 
for a private meeting with farmers and African-American ministers 
before the fund-raising dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	They met with about 75 farmers at a coffee house near the  
Arkansas River, shedding their blue jackets while they chatted with 
the casually dressed farmers about an array of problems, including 
subsidized rice from Japan and subsidized cotton from China. Both 
crops are grown in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proclaimed the current farm bill ``badly broken'' and  
Clinton said he would try to keep Congress in session all year if 
necessary to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign has stressed that the president plays no  
hands-on role in stump strategy -- even as the campaign takes 
advantage of Clinton's ability to invigorate Democrats in the face 
of a primary challenge from Sen. Bill Bradley, and the possibility 
of a tough race against the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Clinton strategist Paul Begala, who is supporting Gore  
from the sidelines, said Gore only stands to benefit from having 
Clinton in his corner, in terms of fund raising and putting the 
full force of presidential power behind Gore's policy ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people are going to say, 'Clinton cheated on his  
wife, so let's go back to Reaganomics and give more tax cuts to the 
rich,''' Begala said. ``And that's exactly what the other side, the 
Republicans would do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Bradley team watched Gore and Clinton with little  
noticeable interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``All presidential elections are about the future and people are  
going to make a judgment of who they want for the future, not so 
much a calculation about the past,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric 
Hauser.

<HEADLINE> Indians Lose Lofton, Cruz to Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Just what the Indians didn't need --  
another major injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland placed two more players on its lengthy disabled list  
Saturday, adding outfielders Kenny Lofton and Jacob Cruz, who may 
have been lost for the season after tearing a thumb ligament Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton hasn't played since injuring his hamstring when he tried  
to stretch a single into a double in the eighth inning of a 14-5 
win over the Detroit Tigers July 27. He was placed on the 15-day DL 
retroactive to July 28, and could be eligible to come off next 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz injured his thumb Friday night, also trying to stretch a  
single into a double in Cleveland's 4-2 loss at Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz, a rookie, flew back to Cleveland for an MRI exam late  
Friday night. He is scheduled to undergo surgery Monday and will be 
out 8-10 weeks, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Roberts and Jolbert Cabrera were promoted from Triple-A  
Buffalo and will platoon in center field until Lofton can return. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians now have seven players on the disabled list,  
including four regulars -- third baseman Travis Fryman, catcher 
Sandy Alomar, outfielder/DH Wil Cordero and Lofton. Pitcher Dwight 
Gooden is also on the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Cleveland has had 13 players on the DL this season yet  
still leads the AL Central by 13 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen anything like this,'' Cleveland general  
manager John Hart said. ``Now even our shock troops are getting 
hurt before they get out of the trenches.''

<HEADLINE> Gwynn Reaches 3,000-Hit Milestone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Tony Gwynn has worn a lot of different uniform  
designs and color schemes on his way to joining the 3,000-hit club. 
Most important to him, they've all been uniforms of the San Diego 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joining the 3,000-hit club as a member of one team and one  
team only, that has a nice ring to it as far as I'm concerned,'' 
Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	With a base hit in his first at-bat Friday night Gwynn became  
the 22nd major leaguer to reach 3,000 hits, and just the eighth 
player to record all of them with one major league team. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished the night with four hits as the Padres beat the  
Montreal Expos 12-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn took care of the milestone hit in his first at-bat as he  
reached down and golfed a soft line drive past second base on a 1-2 
pitch from Dan Smith, a rookie making his 11th career start. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn's teammates raced from the dugout to congratulate him, and  
first base umpire Kerwin Danley -- Gwynn's college teammate at San 
Diego State -- gave him a hug. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball and the first base bag were taken out of play, with one  
or both likely to end up in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``The relief that you feel is the first thing that hits you,''  
Gwynn said. ``Then I was starting to get emotional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fireworks, usually reserved for Expos' home runs, were set off  
as soon as the hit dropped in, and Gwynn's mother, Vendella, 
celebrating her 64th birthday, came onto the field and embraced her 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn became the first NL player since the Cardinals' Lou Brock  
in 1979 to reach 3,000 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	He reached the milestone in front of 13,540 fans -- more than  
30,000 fewer than watched him get his 2,999th hit Thursday in St. 
Louis when Mark McGwire hit his 500th and 501st homer.

<HEADLINE> ABA Chief Urges Better Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The president of the nation's largest lawyers'  
organization advocated stronger gun control measures, saying 
Saturday that most Americans believe more can be done to prevent 
firearm violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be instances like those that occurred in Atlanta  
and Alabama despite our best efforts to avoid it,'' Philip 
Anderson, president of the American Bar Association, said during 
the group's annual meeting. ``But we can still do something about 
gun violence in our society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, three people were shot to death at two companies in  
Pelham, Ala. A week earlier, day trader Mark Barton shot nine 
people to death and injured 13 others at two Atlanta brokerage 
firms. Barton also killed his wife and two children; he committed 
suicide as police closed in. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said it should be unlawful for teen-agers to buy  
military assault weapons. He also favored banning the importation 
of high-capacity ammunition clips and said the background check 
required for firearms sales by license gun dealers should apply to 
such sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Background checks should take a minimum of three days, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``National studies show that 80 percent of the people in America  
believe that we can do more than we are doing now and make it more 
difficult for children to buy guns ... There is no reason in the 
world why teenagers should be able to buy assault weapons,'' 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the ABA has no policy on state efforts to bar cities  
from suing gun manufacturers over firearm violence, but that the 
group generally favors access to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I believe that any entity, city or otherwise, that  
has a legitimate claim should be able to pursue it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pointing to civil rights cases during the 1960s and more recent  
litigation over tobacco, he added, ``The gun industry is another 
industry that it looks like the people will have to resort to the 
courts for relief if the legislatures don't act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson also accused the Immigration and Naturalization Service  
of failing to ensure adequate access to lawyers for aliens detained 
in county jails and other facilities not operated by the federal 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Such access is allowed for those being held in INS facilities,  
he said, but not for the 60 percent of detainees sent under 
contract to other facilities. He said the Justice Department asked 
the ABA to help provide legal help to the detainees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been stonewalled for a year by the INS and I assume  
the INS thinks it can put it off forever,'' Anderson said.

<HEADLINE> FBI Fired 32 for Misconduct in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of FBI employees fired for  
misconduct rose from 19 to 32 between 1997 and 1998. The bureau 
says swifter completion of more internal investigations was the 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
	In its annual report Friday, the bureau's Office of Professional  
Responsibility said that 301 employees received discipline ranging 
from oral reprimands to dismissal in 1998, compared with 212 the 
preceding year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is premature to describe the increase as a trend,'' the  
FBI's internal watchdog office said. ``The increase in employees 
disciplined is attributable in part to increased efficiency in the 
disciplinary process'' because more agents were assigned to the 
watchdog office. 
</P>
<P>
	The expanded office completed 528 investigations during 1998,  
compared to only 399 in 1997. The report also said the backlog of 
cases open for more than a year was reduced from 24.3 percent of 
the outstanding total at the end of fiscal 1997 to 16.7 percent at 
the end of fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most notable 1998 cases, special agent Daron  
Council of New Orleans was accused of attempting to extort money 
from a drug dealer. After an investigation, Council was arrested, 
fired and pleaded guilty to two counts of soliciting and accepting 
a bribe. He was sentenced to 16 months in prison and fined $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Other FBI employees were fired for lying to internal  
investigators, unauthorized disclosures, unprofessional conduct, 
misuse of government property, drunk driving, drug abuse, sexual 
harassment, misuse of a bureau position, theft or embezzlement of 
government property and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 301 employees disciplined in 1998 represented just under  
half the 615 employees whose investigations for serious misconduct 
were completed that year. The 301 include 140 agents and 161 
support workers and comprise 1.1 percent of the bureau's total 
workforce. Of the 32 fired, 11 were agents and 21 support workers. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, the 212 disciplined in 1997 included 99 agents  
and 113 support workers and comprised 0.8 percent of the workforce 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1998, six employees were demoted, 60 were suspended  
without pay for 15 or more days, 94 were suspended without pay for 
14 or fewer days, five were put on probation, 64 were censured, and 
40 received oral reprimands. 
</P>
<P>
	An increasing number of allegations of domestic violence by FBI  
workers is being reported as more and more local police use arrests 
rather than conciliation to resolve such incidents, the Office of 
Professional Responsibility said. ``Allegations regarding such 
abuse have included agent and support employees, males and females, 
spouses and unmarried persons and children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which was distributed to all FBI employees, warned:  
``A criminal assault in the home is conduct far beneath the 
standards the FBI expects of its employees and is treated as 
serious misconduct. ... Discipline may be imposed even if a local 
criminal conviction does not result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI Director Louis Freeh has more than doubled the staff at the  
Office of Professional Responsibility since 1997, and Justice 
Department Inspector General Michael Bromwich said last week it has 
become more professional. But Bromwich said the bureau needs a 
permanent outside watchdog agency whose investigations he said 
would have greater deterrent effect and more public credibility 
than internal reviews.

<HEADLINE> Freud Changed Way We Look at Things </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One hundred years ago, a 43-year-old Viennese  
neurologist produced a book with an intriguing claim: that dreams 
express our hidden desires. Despite its vivid prose and frank talk 
about sex, almost no one read it. Six years after publication, 
``The Interpretation of Dreams'' had sold only 351 copies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the author, Sigmund Freud, started a conversation, and we  
haven't stopped talking since. 
</P>
<P>
	``Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a  
lifetime,'' Freud himself observed later. 
</P>
<P>
	After a century of Freud, you can blame him or thank him, laugh  
or lie down, but a couch may never again be just a couch. Never 
again will we look at ourselves and each other in quite the same 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	He took us inward. He gave us the talking cure, a technique he  
called ``psychoanalysis'' that uses free association, dream 
interpretation and the patient's response to the analyst to explore 
the mind. A father of three boys and three girls, Freud plumbed the 
child's-eye view to find the core of the adult. If our dreams 
tumble with secrets exposed, he said, awake we're driven by 
conflicts deep in the unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing is accidental. Everything has meaning. Freedom comes  
when we know how we were shaped by the past -- that's the goal of 
psychoanalysis. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been doubters from the start -- the most basic  
criticism that there's simply no proof that Freud's methods work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if people get better, that doesn't mean they get better  
because of the treatment,'' said Adolf Grunbaum, a leading Freud 
skeptic who is a philosopher of science and a research professor of 
psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. Grunbaum respects 
Freud's genius but says he generalized too much and claimed credit 
as originator of ideas from antiquity. 
</P>
<P>
	Original or not, Freud's work swept away old views of how the  
mind works and brought new insights into mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Freud's time, the mentally ill were lucky if they didn't  
get locked away in an asylum, where shackles and beatings were 
common, said his biographer, historian Peter Gay, who runs the 
Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
	An alternative, usually available only to the wealthy, was  
sometimes called moral treatment or moral therapy. This was found 
in country retreats that offered mainly rest, exercise, nourishing 
food and a lot of talking. ``Above all, being gentle with them,'' 
Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people were just neglected or just let go. These are  
the crazy eccentrics you read about in Dickens,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And after Freud?  
</P>
<P>
	Just listen. Everyday talk bubbles with words from the  
psychological lexicon: psyche out, obsessive, compulsive, 
repressed, oedipal, well-adjusted, manic. 
</P>
<P>
	We're urged to talk about our feelings. We fantasize. We  
project. We're in denial. We internalize. We grow paranoid with 
anxiety. We're on guard against subliminal messages in advertising. 
We suppress urges when our inner child threatens to get us in 
trouble by acting out. 
</P>
<P>
	A newsletter for investors advises those suddenly enriched by a  
windfall: ``Maintaining our former sense of self might be difficult 
and important relationships are likely to change. ... if you decide 
not to work, will you be able to feel good about yourself?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flocks of counselors offer psychological rescue for whole towns  
after traumas such as school shootings and deadly weather. Project 
Heartland, funded by government to provide counseling after the 
1995 Oklahoma City bombing, offered the same service when tornadoes 
ripped through the Midwest this year. Tipper Gore, the vice 
president's wife, led a recent White House conference to dispel 
myths about people who suffer from mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not all serious.  
</P>
<P>
	The ``Peanuts'' comic strip character Lucy dispenses psychiatric  
help at 5 cents a pop. Robert DeNiro plays a mobster with 
trigger-anxiety and Billy Crystal plays his therapist in the comedy 
movie ``Analyze This.'' But then, show business has always loved 
Freud. Check out ``Lady in the Dark,'' a Broadway musical turned 
into a 1944 movie starring Ginger Rogers as a magazine editor who 
undergoes analysis to decide among three beaux, with music by Kurt 
Weill and Ira Gershwin. 
</P>
<P>
	There was even a 1962 Hollywood biography, ``Freud,'' with  
Montgomery Clift in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
	Sigmund Freud was born May 6, 1856, in what is now the Czech  
Republic, and lived in Vienna most of his life. His home is a 
museum and he's a revered national figure in Austria. He died Sept. 
23, 1939, in London, a refugee from the Nazis, who burned the books 
of the atheist Jew. An 83-year-old man with cancer of the jaw, he 
asked for a fatal dose of morphine. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1800s, his research into neurology had drawn him to  
study hysteria -- strange symptoms of distress, like paralyzed limbs 
with no physical cause. This led him toward the mind. The Victorian 
period was waning, sex was back in vogue. Then World War I put a 
focus on aggression. Freud concluded the two drives were basic. 
</P>
<P>
	A writer of clear and powerful prose, Freud reached  
practitioners and public alike. He organized a movement to spread 
his theories. 
</P>
<P>
	Timing, good writing and promotion. ``Those three coalesced,''  
said Michael Roth, curator of the Library of Congress exhibit 
``Sigmund Freud: Conflict and Culture'' now at the Jewish Museum in 
New York and headed to Vienna and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Freud applied his theories to other fields. He analyzed society  
and history, religion and art, morality and politics. 
</P>
<P>
	By midcentury, his influence and stature were clear -- placing  
him, according to one scholar's choice published in 1949, third 
among the 10 ``greats of our time,'' after Mohandas Gandhi and 
Albert Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
	The '50s and '60s were Freud's heyday in America.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was the only show in town,'' said Rosemarie Sand, a retired  
psychoanalyst in White Plains, N.Y. ``It was the answer to 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1970s, Freudian psychoanalysis, a process that may  
involve several sessions each week and take years, has been 
eclipsed in popularity by other forms of less costly and intensive 
psychotherapy and by drugs. Employers and health insurers no longer 
want to pay for unlimited therapy and many people lack the time or 
inclination. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguments over Freud continue to rage. Witness the controversy  
over the Library of Congress show, which opened last year in 
Washington after a two-year delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers blamed a lack of funding, but concern that it would  
be worshipful and one-sided prompted historian Peter Swales to 
circulate a petition in which 50 scholars and critics urged that 
the exhibit ``adequately reflect the full spectrum of informed 
opinion about the status of Freud's contribution to intellectual 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curator Roth, associate director of the Getty Research Institute  
for the History of Art and the Humanities in Los Angeles, said he 
had intended to consult Freud's critics before the petition, but 
the controversy made him more sensitive to it. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, emblazoned above the displays of letters and  
diaries and drafts in Freud's fluid, uphill script, are statements 
like feminist Germaine Greer's acid observation in 1970: ``Freud is 
the father of psychoanalysis. It had no mother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Swales questioned the entire discipline that  
Freud fathered. ``What are the benefits of 100 years of 
psychoanalysis?'' he said, speaking from his home in New York. The 
field that probes the mind is subject to fads, he said, noting 
current enthusiasm for drugs like Prozac, the world's best-selling 
antidepressant. ``The field of psychiatry is overpopulated with 
fashion victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, feminists were among those who brought Freud down  
from his pedestal, ridiculing ideas such as his theory that women 
are destined to be unhappy because they lack the physical apparatus 
of males. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women are quite right about Freud,'' said Mrs. Sand.  
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to a female friend Freud famously asked, ``What does  
a woman want?'' What a woman wants, said Mrs. Sand, is equal rights 
and fair treatment. ``Nowadays, your typical analyst, he's not 
going to hit her with penis envy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Decades earlier, Karen Horney, a prominent German-American  
psychiatrist, called Freud's theories on femininity male fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
	Freud ``did make a great contribution because he was the first  
one to talk about the sexuality of women,'' said Ruth Lax, an 
author, psychologist and analyst who teaches at Cornell Medical 
School. ``He didn't fully understand it, but he acknowledged it. 
That was a great step forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Freud's work was not about women, however, but about  
people in general. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout his life he revisited his theories, discarding,  
changing and trying out new ones. Like the patients he treated -- 
like the patients who today seek help from psychotherapists and 
analysts -- Freud was shaped by who he was, when and where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
	As his granddaughter Sophie Freud, a psychologist, has said of  
his theories: ``They should never be cast in cement; only religion 
does that. His work is a mixture of amazing leaps into the future, 
with other parts embedded in his own time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His ideas have provided a bedrock from which more modern theory  
has evolved, even though many were only grasped on a ``superficial 
... cocktail-party level,'' Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freud offered explanations for the everyday mysteries. For  
example, sibling rivalry. ``Everybody has known brothers and 
sisters don't always get along,'' Gay said. ``But he gives you ways 
of understanding how this might come about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Gay, ``Maybe one of the most important things he talks  
about is that people love and hate each other at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freud visited the United States just once. In September 1909 he  
spent a week at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., lecturing on 
psychoanalysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet it was this country that gave Freud's ideas their warmest  
embrace. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? Perhaps it's American insecurity, identity issues in a  
nation of immigrants, people always reinventing themselves; or, in 
a culture that exalts the striver, another way to seek personal and 
interpersonal perfection. 
</P>
<P>
	Freud, if he were alive today, might not recognize his legacy,  
much less approve. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet a direct lineage can be traced from the neurotic Europeans  
on Freud's couch -- really more of a chaise lounge draped with an 
oriental rug -- to today's walking wounded of America talking 
upright to psychotherapists about anything from childhood abuse to 
marriage troubles and alcoholism to neurotic pets. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, it's normal in much of the world to seek professional  
help for what ails the mind. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, psychologist Rika Kayama writes a magazine advice  
column and appears on TV variety and quiz shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In Scotland, two policewomen sent to the 1996 school massacre in  
the town of Dunblane, where 16 children and a teacher died, are 
suing their employers, claiming they didn't get enough counseling 
for stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people in India can afford psychotherapy, but they can call  
and seek advice from Dr. Broota, a popular voice on New Delhi 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia, where Freud's works were once banned and dissidents  
were tossed into psychiatric wards as punishment, people now clamor 
for therapy to cure stress, sex problems, alcoholism, drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, the Chinese used to denounce psychology as bourgeois  
and told the insane to improve their thinking by reading Mao 
Tse-tung. These days they worry about a therapist shortage. Many 
cities now offer counseling hotlines; Shanghai has at least nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Buenos Aires claims the world's highest per capita supply of  
psychoanalysts, many clustered in one part of town. It's called 
``Villa Freud.''

<HEADLINE> Browns Days From 'Great Comeback' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The greatest comeback in NFL history is nearly  
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Browns are just days from their rebirth following  
an excruciating three-year absence for their devoted fans, whose 
football passion helped return the team. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the expansion Browns take the field in their  
traditional, plain orange helmets and all-white uniforms for Monday 
night's Hall of Fame Game against the Dallas Cowboys in Canton, 
Ohio, one of the league's signature cities will officially have its 
beloved team back. 
</P>
<P>
	And its heart.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, baby,'' said cornerback Antonio Langham, one of the  
three new Browns who also played for the team taken to Baltimore by 
former owner Art Modell in February 1996. ``It's Cleveland football 
again. It's time to start bleeding orange and brown again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the rest of the world has been counting down the days  
until the new millennium, Cleveland has been ticking off the hours 
and seconds to the moment the new Browns kick off. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what Cleveland has been waiting for,'' Langham said.  
``Get ready everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Get ready, NFL. The Dawg Pound is about to be unleashed.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	With the possible exception of Green Bay, nowhere is a city's  
makeup more defined by football than in Cleveland. Football is more 
than a sport or passing interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's who we are,'' electrician Armand Monday said after  
wrapping up one of his final days working at the new, 72,000-seat, 
state-of-the-art Cleveland Browns Stadium, constructed on the 
shores of Lake Erie over the site of the old Municipal Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Football has always been here, that's what made it so tough  
when the Browns left,'' he said. ``Sometimes you don't know how 
much you'll miss something until it's gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long before comedian Drew Carey was fitted for his first pair of  
black glasses in suburban Brooklyn, Ohio, and decades ahead of the 
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame becoming the city's top tourist 
attraction, the Browns owned Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns Town, they called it.  
</P>
<P>
	Paul Brown's teams of the 1940s dominated the old All-America  
Football Conference, winning four straight titles, and when the 
storied coach brought the Browns into the NFL in 1950, they 
promptly won the championship and redefined the game with a 
wide-open passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns played in 10 straight championship games, and their  
success carried into the '60s when Jim Brown shredded defenses as 
perhaps the greatest running back in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's teams of the '70s and '80s never made it to the  
Super Bowl. But their close calls -- ``Red Right 88'' (Brian Sipe's 
end-zone interception against Oakland in 1981), The Drive (John 
Elway's 98-yarder in 1987), and The Fumble (Ernest Byner's at the 
goal line in Denver in 1988) -- epitomized the struggling city, 
which became a national joke when its river caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet despite five losing seasons in six years to start the 90s,  
no one was prepared for Nov. 6, 1995. After failing to convince 
Cleveland officials to build him a new stadium, Modell announced he 
was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was devastating,'' said Bob Wilson, a real-estate broker  
and season-ticket holder. ``He ripped our hearts out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grown men wept openly while watching Modell's news conference  
from Baltimore a few days later. And all of Cleveland, which had 
undergone a remarkable downtown renaissance, felt crushed and 
betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Three thousand miles away, 49ers president Carmen Policy thought  
he knew how Browns fans felt. But Policy, an Ohio native who left 
his job in San Francisco to run the new Browns, said it wasn't 
until he came to Cleveland that he began to understand the depth of 
the city's pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was as though they'd been cheated,'' Policy said. ``People  
referred to it like a death in the family. Well, it wasn't like it 
was just a death in the family. It was like a family member had 
been murdered. That's the feeling. It wasn't just a loss, it was a 
cruel and unfair loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sundays that once revolved around Browns games weren't fun  
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't watch football for three years,'' Dale Gailbraith of  
Indianapolis said recently after driving six hours to see the new 
Browns hold their first summer training camp practice. ``It was a 
long, long three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine New York without the Yankees. Montreal without the  
Canadiens. Notre Dame without the Fighting Irish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember saying to my father, those people have to be  
hurting,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer said. ``I grew up rooting for 
the New York Giants, and it took me a year to get over them moving 
across the river to play in Jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the shock wore off, Clevelanders wiped away their tears and  
began to fight. They overwhelmed NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue's 
office with faxes and letters demanding a new franchise. Led by 
Mayor Michael R. White and with the help of former Browns players 
such as Bernie Kosar, Lou Groza and Paul Warfield, Cleveland 
mounted a ``Save Our Browns'' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The unprecedented movement convinced the NFL to make a deal with  
Cleveland, agreeing to allow the city to keep its nickname, colors 
and history, and promising a new team in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Lerner, a local billionaire and minority owner under Modell  
(it was on Lerner's private jet that Modell signed the final papers 
to go to Baltimore), won an ownership bidding war and bought the 
new Browns for a then-record $530 million in September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Monday night, after 40 former Browns are introduced  
before the game and Hall of Famers Otto Graham, Leroy Kelly, Groza 
and Warfield participate in the coin toss, a new era of football 
will begin in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won,'' said John Thompson, aka ``Big Dawg'', the leader of  
the Browns' rabid Dawg Pound. ``It's a big victory. We showed the 
rest of the country that Cleveland sticks together, that we aren't 
the Mistake on the Lake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just 12 days later, Browns fans will gather again on the  
lakefront, making the familiar walk across the foot bridge on West 
Third Street to their brand new stadium as the Browns play the 
Minnesota Vikings in Cleveland's first home game since Dec. 17, 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	When fans enter the stadium, they'll pass by a plaque honoring  
their commitment to bringing the Browns back. 
</P>
<P>
	It reads, in part: ``Cleveland Browns Stadium is dedicated to  
the invincible spirit of Browns fans who, through their 
perseverance and tenacity, refused to say goodbye. OUR TEAM ... OUR 
NAME ... OUR COLORS.''

<HEADLINE> Brickyard Finish Goes Up in Smoke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Dale Jarrett drove 'round and 'round in the  
Brickyard 400 today, with a phalanx of drivers chasing him. It 
promised to be a quite a finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it all went up in a puff of smoke.  
</P>
<P>
	When Dave Marcis' engine went ``poof'' on lap 142, so did all  
the questions about who would make it to the end of the race and 
who wouldn't. Given a chance to stop for gas and tires, everyone 
made it fine -- except none of them even came close to catching 
Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything was possible,'' said Jeff Gordon, who was right in  
the mix of leaders and knew he wasn't going to make it to the 
checkered flag without stopping once more for gas. ``But it doesn't 
matter, because the caution did come out and that's the way that it 
ended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of nervously watching a shootout at the end, the  
leaders' pit crews had to hustle into action. Jarrett gambled and 
took two tires, then easily drove away to his second Brickyard 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``The caution came out, and I said, `Here we go again. What do  
we do?''' said Jarrett, the Winston Cup points leader who ran out 
of gas last year at the Brickyard. ``Do we get four tires? I said 
two, and Todd agreed with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's Todd, as in Parrott, Jarrett's crew chief. He's the one  
who told Jarrett with about 40 laps to go that he could make it to 
the end without refueling. 
</P>
<P>
	A few laps later, car owner Robert Yates was asked the same  
question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' Yates said nervously, then pausing for a beat before  
rephrasing. ``Maybe. If we're lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if anyone on Jarrett's No. 88 Ford Taurus team was nervous,  
they didn't convey that to the man who was at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jarrett, Mark Martin, Bobby Labonte and Gordon emerged from  
their final pit stops, only Gordon had a car as fast as Jarrett's. 
All the leaders took two fresh tires except Gordon, who took four 
and made up several spots to finish third. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just didn't have enough laps to get it done,'' Gordon said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett's car was so strong that it didn't matter that he only  
had two new tires. 
</P>
<P>
	``With two tires, we had no idea what it would do,'' Jarrett  
said. ``We hadn't tried it. ... Once we got out front, it just took 
off. They were some of the fastest laps we ran all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Burton also was in the mix for the final round of stops,  
shooting through the field like a rocket to make up several spots 
and take third. 
</P>
<P>
	But he decided to ignore crew chief Frank Stoddard, who called  
for four new tires. As the crew started removing the lug nuts on 
the driver's side, Burton drove away -- possibly leaving some of the 
lugs loose. He faded badly and finished fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't any miscommunication,'' Burton said. ``That was  
simply a case of the driver overruling the crew chief. I know it 
scared Frank, but taking two tires was the only thing we could 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the smoke cleared, the 320,000 fans who packed the stands  
for the sixth Brickyard got to see some intriguing pit strategy. 
They'll have to wait at least until next year for a fantastic 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just the way it is,'' Labonte said. ``Sometimes, the  
difference between first and second is that piece of paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not this time.

<HEADLINE> Anheuser-Busch Teamsters Ratify Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Teamsters at all 12 of Anheuser-Busch Inc.'s  
plants across the country approved a five-year contract Saturday, 
but labor woes at the nation's largest brewery are not over. 
</P>
<P>
	Because union members at six breweries rejected local contract  
supplements, it was unclear whether the national contract would be 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch -- maker of Budweiser, Bud Light, Michelob and  
other beers -- has said that until there is agreement on all 
national and local contracts there is no agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 8,000 bottlers, distillers, truck drivers and mechanics at  
the domestic breweries ratified the national contract by a 59 
percent margin, Teamsters President James P. Hoffa said. 
</P>
<P>
	John E. Jacob, spokesman for Anheuser-Busch, said the two  
parties will likely talk about whether there is a middle ground. He 
said options could include establishing the national contract only 
in those breweries where local agreements were reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Local contract supplements were rejected in St. Louis;  
Cartersville, Ga.; Fort Collins, Colo.; and Jacksonville, Fla. Some 
locals at plants in Newark, N.J., and Los Angeles rejected the 
contract supplements, while others approved them.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Gives Gore Campaign Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore may be concerned  
about being perceived as too close to a president who was 
impeached, but that is not stopping him from using Bill Clinton's 
fund-raising prowess to boost his White House hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	The president extolled Gore's accomplishments Saturday during an  
outreach meeting with religious leaders here, calling Gore ``by far 
the most influential and effective and productive vice president'' 
in history and directly urging them to support him. 
</P>
<P>
	``An election is a job interview. He wants you to hire him,''  
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do, I do,'' Gore interjected amid peals of laughter.  
</P>
<P>
	``And all of these other people that are running are perfectly  
nice people, but all of them are saying, 'Hire us too, we want to 
be president, and sooner or later we'll get around to telling you 
why,''' Clinton continued. ``You already know more about him than 
anybody else running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the president addressed a fund-raiser for the Gore 2000  
presidential campaign committee, the first of a series of such 
events featuring Clinton. The president also will attend four 
fund-raisers in the nation's capital, two next week and two on 
Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's dinner at the State House Convention Center was  
expected to draw 500 of Arkansas' most influential Democrats, with 
each asked to contribute at least $500. Other scheduled speakers 
included Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark.; U.S. Transportation 
Secretary Rodney Slater and Arkansas Attorney General Mark Pryor. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, Gore has told associates he had felt the drag of  
Clinton's impeachment on attempts to get his own campaign in gear 
during the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign officials said last week they were confident the  
public was well past any unease about Clinton and his personal 
behavior. But it was clear Saturday that public pairings of Clinton 
and Gore were planned carefully planned so the politicians would 
not come across as a team. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president arrived in Little Rock separately from  
Clinton, flying in from Chicago where he was speaking to a meeting 
of the Rainbow Coalition. Clinton and Gore were appearing together 
for a private meeting with farmers and African-American ministers 
before the fund-raising dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	They met with about 75 farmers at a coffee house near the  
Arkansas River, shedding their blue jackets while they chatted with 
the casually dressed farmers about an array of problems, including 
subsidized rice from Japan and subsidized cotton from China. Both 
crops are grown in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proclaimed the current farm bill ``badly broken'' and  
Clinton said he would try to keep Congress in session all year if 
necessary to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign has stressed that the president plays no  
hands-on role in stump strategy -- even as the campaign takes 
advantage of Clinton's ability to invigorate Democrats in the face 
of a primary challenge from Sen. Bill Bradley, and the possibility 
of a tough race against the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Clinton strategist Paul Begala, who is supporting Gore  
from the sidelines, said Gore only stands to benefit from having 
Clinton in his corner, in terms of fund raising and putting the 
full force of presidential power behind Gore's policy ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This slavish devotion to Bush's lead in the polls is breeding  
a surrenderist strategy among a few faint-hearted Democrats,'' 
Begala said. ``I don't think people are going to say, 'Clinton 
cheated on his wife, so let's go back to Reaganomics and give more 
tax cuts to the rich.' And that's exactly what the other side, the 
Republicans would do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore and Clinton were teaming up again on the campaign  
trail, the Bradley team watched from the sidelines with little 
noticeable interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``All presidential elections are about the future and people are  
going to make a judgment of who they want for the future, not so 
much a calculation about the past,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric 
Hauser.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Titans Explore New Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans, anxious to check  
out their new stadium, held a dress rehearsal today at Adelphia 
Coliseum. And the initial reviews are just what the team wanted to 
hear. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awesome,'' said Tony Wakefield of Nashville, who showed  
up with his 19-year-old son Jeremiah. ``I've been driving by the 
stadium for months. My wife is sick of me driving by this place. 
We're just about to bust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 49,000 owners of personal seat licenses, who have the  
right to buy season tickets, were invited to watch the team end its 
first week of training camp with a practice and rookie scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans play their first exhibition game at the stadium Aug.  
27 against the Atlanta Falcons with the season opener Sept. 12 
against Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, 41,637 PSL owners showed up for their first chance  
to sit in their seats and check out what the $292 million stadium 
looks like with players on the field. It didn't hurt that the 
Titans eased the 90-degree plus heat with cut-rate concessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The players also had the opportunity for a sneak peek of game  
days by driving themselves to the stadium before fanning out to 
meet fans and sign autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	``How nice it is to finally have a home,' said free safety  
Marcus Robertson. ``It's real exciting. At the same time, it's 
going to be kind of overwhelming when we get to that first 
preseason game. The guys are real excited with the buzz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Fisher thanked the crowd, which was larger than the  
team could fit into Vanderbilt Stadium where Tennessee played last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been four years Aug. 11 when this whole thing started,''  
Fisher said of the move from Houston. ``This is the start of a new 
era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the 67,700-seat stadium, which sits next to Interstates 24  
and 65 and across the Cumberland River from downtown Nashville, 
drew the biggest raves. 
</P>
<P>
	The team played one year in Memphis and last season at  
Vanderbilt Stadium in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Television sets still have to be installed near concession  
areas, and the stairwells need sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
	But Joe and Cindy Holland of Nashville said maybe critics will  
stop complaining and start attending games now that the team is no 
longer playing in college stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	The franchise drew a league-worst average of 28,095 playing the  
1997 season in Memphis' Liberty Bowl and 37,444 last year at 
Vanderbilt Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hollands, who have attended NFL games at Chicago's Soldier  
Field, Atlanta's Georgia Dome and Minnesota's Metrodome, have been 
waiting for the Titans' new stadium to open to have the NFL 
experience in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vandy did not compare,'' Mrs. Holland said. ``I hated  
Vanderbilt.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Govs. Eye Tax Cut Plan Warily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Suspicious of their party leaders in  
Washington, Republican governors applauded Congress' tax cut plan 
Saturday but warned that they will not let GOP lawmakers raid state 
budgets to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican congressional leaders have considered asking the  
nation's governors to return up to $6 billion in welfare money to 
help balance the books on their 10-year, $792 billion tax cut 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Several governors accused fellow Republicans in Washington of  
trying to renege on pledges to ship the money to states. They 
suggested the development could damage their promised partnership 
with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``This must be a calamitous staff error, because I can't believe  
they would do this to us, said Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, 
attending the four-day National Governors' Association meeting, 
which opened Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would lose a great deal of credibility and I don't think  
they want to do that,'' said Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, a 
national leader on welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing force in Republican politics, the GOP governors said  
they are confident congressional leaders are preparing to back 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	But even the prospect of success has not dampened the state  
leaders' bitterness. For most governors, the first word of a plan 
to seek state money came from press accounts -- not their leadership 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Governors do not like being kept out of the loop, especially  
after the leadership promised in 1998 to give them a greater role 
in framing policy and political strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``With any partnership, you've got to make sure your partner is  
reliable,'' Gov. John Engler of Michigan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors' stock rose after huge victories in the 1998  
elections underscored the popularity of their mainstream, can-do 
politics while confrontational congressional Republicans suffered a 
series of election night defeats. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking the return of money would be an irony for a political  
party whose oft-stated philosophy is to dispense dollars and power 
to the states. It also might force Republican governors to forsake 
tax cuts at home for spending needs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal posed a dilemma for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the  
elected leader of the nation's second-largest state and the 
front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Bush ``supports keeping the funds  
in the states and hopes Congress will listen to the nation's 
governors on this issue.'' Bush was not attending the NAG meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Under welfare reform legislation enacted in 1996, the nation's  
governors were guaranteed current levels of funding for five years. 
Governors lobbied for the guarantee, saying they had assumed a 
heavy risk because the need for welfare money could outstrip the 
supply of federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	The states have dramatically reduced welfare rolls and, in some  
cases, have surplus welfare money. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Gov. Michael Leavitt of Utah, incoming chairman of  
the governors' group, said Congress needs to realize the states are 
done with the easiest part of welfare reform; the toughest and most 
expensive cases -- welfare recipients with the lowest prospect for 
jobs -- remain a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's keep the financial integrity of our relationship (with  
Congress) intact,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of seeking state money was broached last month by Rep.  
Tom DeLay of Texas, the GOP whip, and approved by Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Several governors and their aides said they suspected the idea  
was leaked to reporters to test the level of opposition, which is 
high. Engler said the leadership used the threat to show 
rank-and-file lawmakers what might happen if they propose too much 
new spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fizzled,'' Thompson said of the idea. He and several  
other high-profile state executives personally lobbied 
congressional leaders in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Don Nichols, R-Okla., and Hastert are making separate  
appearances at the governors' meeting and are expected to offer an 
olive branch, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no clear signal Saturday that the leadership was  
backing down. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the House,  
said Saturday he has not heard from an unhappy governor. A second 
House GOP leader, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, was more pointed: 
``If it's good to cut taxes at the state level, it's good to cut 
taxes at the federal level,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both lawmakers spoke in Omaha, Neb., at a gathering of  
Republican activists from the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, former governor of Arkansas, has promised to  
veto the GOP tax plan, and may warn governors in a speech Sunday at 
their meeting that the cuts will hurt state budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute has muted the governors' praise of the congressional  
tax package. Leavitt said he support ``the theory of cutting 
taxes'' but wanted to see the details of the congressional plan 
before endorsing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating delivered the national radio address for the party  
Saturday, criticizing the Clinton-Gore administration's tax 
history. ``They want to use it to buy more government,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 31 Republican governors and 17 Democrats. Gov. Jesse  
Ventura of Minnesota is a member of the Reform Party. Gov. Angus 
King of Maine is an independent.

<HEADLINE> GOP Hopefuls Take Shots at Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Republicans from Steve Forbes to Gary Bauer  
took aim Saturday at an absent Texas Gov. George W. Bush, while the 
GOP front-runner and other big names in the presidential field 
skipped a meeting of Midwestern activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander proposed a ``12th  
commandment'' to go along with the one about Republicans not 
attacking each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a 12th Commandment for Republicans,'' Alexander said:  
``When picking a president, thou shalt have a contest, and the 
contest shall be on the issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative activist Bauer warned that leading Republicans are  
cheating the party by not debating the GOP's direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're not willing to confront each other on the direction  
of the party, how are we going to confront Al Gore?'' Bauer asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, Alexander, Forbes and commentator Alan Keyes were among a  
shrunken list of Republican contenders who spoke at a meeting of 
GOP activists from 13 Midwestern states. 
</P>
<P>
	Commentator Pat Buchanan dropped out Friday, and former Vice  
President Dan Quayle sent word earlier Saturday he wouldn't show 
up. Aides said later it was because Quayle's mother is ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and former Cabinet officer Elizabeth Dole never agreed to  
attend the meeting. Thus the 850 delegates found themselves with 
the lesser-known candidates focusing harsh words on Bush, enjoying 
a huge lead in the early polls and in raising money. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Eric Woolson said Bush was spending the weekend on  
vacation with his family in Maine. ``This is the last weekend 
before his daughters start back to school,'' said Woolson. ``He 
wanted to be with them. He understands the event in Omaha is 
important, but his commitment to his daughters is his first 
priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately you're not going to win by being anointed by the  
elite in Washington,'' Forbes said. ``Ultimately, the people make 
the decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think that we face a crisis in this country, a crisis of  
arrogance,'' Keyes said. ``A crisis of those who believe that they 
are going to usurp the votes of our people, substituting money 
power and media power for the actual decisions that people make in 
the voting booth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes argued that Bush' skipping many early campaign events  
amounts to a ``spit in the face of ordinary voters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's big lead in the polls drew scorn from candidates who  
insisted that voters haven't really begun to focus on the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strong message, ground forces and resources: Ultimately that's  
how you win,'' Forbes said. ``When the American people start to 
focus nationally on this campaign later this year and the next 
year, we are going to be ready. Others, I think, are going to be 
following in our wake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the conference was opened by Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who  
dropped out of the campaign last month, endorsed Bush and told 
reporters Saturday his nomination is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stars are aligned,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Alexander rejected that argument, saying Bush will inevitably  
have to engage other contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans are looking for a winner and a leader, and we  
don't get that by letting big money or big media decide this for 
us,'' Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said many in the GOP see Bush leading the party away from  
its conservative base. ``There's a lot of discontent in the 
Republican ranks,'' Bauer said. ``There are people who are yearning 
for a Reagan-type message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said many activists are becoming annoyed that Bush is  
skipping events. ``I would hope the time is fast approaching when 
it is getting to be more than disappointment,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates were treated to a list of GOP congressional leaders  
who were beginning the job of selling a tax-cut package they've 
approved.

<HEADLINE> Freud Changed Way We Look at Things </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One hundred years ago, a 43-year-old Viennese  
neurologist produced a book with an intriguing claim: that dreams 
express our hidden desires. Despite its vivid prose and frank talk 
about sex, almost no one read it. Six years after publication, 
``The Interpretation of Dreams'' had sold only 351 copies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the author, Sigmund Freud, started a conversation, and we  
haven't stopped talking since. 
</P>
<P>
	``Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a  
lifetime,'' Freud himself observed later. 
</P>
<P>
	After a century of Freud, you can blame him or thank him, laugh  
or lie down, but a couch may never again be just a couch. Never 
again will we look at ourselves and each other in quite the same 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	He took us inward. He gave us the talking cure, a technique he  
called ``psychoanalysis'' that uses free association, dream 
interpretation and the patient's response to the analyst to explore 
the mind. A father of three boys and three girls, Freud plumbed the 
child's-eye view to find the core of the adult. If our dreams 
tumble with secrets exposed, he said, awake we're driven by 
conflicts deep in the unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing is accidental. Everything has meaning. Freedom comes  
when we know how we were shaped by the past -- that's the goal of 
psychoanalysis. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been doubters from the start -- the most basic  
criticism that there's simply no proof that Freud's methods work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if people get better, that doesn't mean they get better  
because of the treatment,'' said Adolf Grunbaum, a leading Freud 
skeptic who is a philosopher of science and a research professor of 
psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. Grunbaum respects 
Freud's genius but says he generalized too much and claimed credit 
as originator of ideas from antiquity. 
</P>
<P>
	Original or not, Freud's work swept away old views of how the  
mind works and brought new insights into mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Freud's time, the mentally ill were lucky if they didn't  
get locked away in an asylum, where shackles and beatings were 
common, said his biographer, historian Peter Gay, who runs the 
Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
	An alternative, usually available only to the wealthy, was  
sometimes called moral treatment or moral therapy. This was found 
in country retreats that offered mainly rest, exercise, nourishing 
food and a lot of talking. ``Above all, being gentle with them,'' 
Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people were just neglected or just let go. These are  
the crazy eccentrics you read about in Dickens,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And after Freud?  
</P>
<P>
	Just listen. Everyday talk bubbles with words from the  
psychological lexicon: psyche out, obsessive, compulsive, 
repressed, oedipal, well-adjusted, manic. 
</P>
<P>
	We're urged to talk about our feelings. We fantasize. We  
project. We're in denial. We internalize. We grow paranoid with 
anxiety. We're on guard against subliminal messages in advertising. 
We suppress urges when our inner child threatens to get us in 
trouble by acting out. 
</P>
<P>
	A newsletter for investors advises those suddenly enriched by a  
windfall: ``Maintaining our former sense of self might be difficult 
and important relationships are likely to change. ... if you decide 
not to work, will you be able to feel good about yourself?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flocks of counselors offer psychological rescue for whole towns  
after traumas such as school shootings and deadly weather. Project 
Heartland, funded by government to provide counseling after the 
1995 Oklahoma City bombing, offered the same service when tornadoes 
ripped through the Midwest this year. Tipper Gore, the vice 
president's wife, led a recent White House conference to dispel 
myths about people who suffer from mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not all serious.  
</P>
<P>
	The ``Peanuts'' comic strip character Lucy dispenses psychiatric  
help at 5 cents a pop. Robert DeNiro plays a mobster with 
trigger-anxiety and Billy Crystal plays his therapist in the comedy 
movie ``Analyze This.'' But then, show business has always loved 
Freud. Check out ``Lady in the Dark,'' a Broadway musical turned 
into a 1944 movie starring Ginger Rogers as a magazine editor who 
undergoes analysis to decide among three beaux, with music by Kurt 
Weill and Ira Gershwin. 
</P>
<P>
	There was even a 1962 Hollywood biography, ``Freud,'' with  
Montgomery Clift in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
	Sigmund Freud was born May 6, 1856, in what is now the Czech  
Republic, and lived in Vienna most of his life. His home is a 
museum and he's a revered national figure in Austria. He died Sept. 
23, 1939, in London, a refugee from the Nazis, who burned the books 
of the atheist Jew. An 83-year-old man with cancer of the jaw, he 
asked for a fatal dose of morphine. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1800s, his research into neurology had drawn him to  
study hysteria -- strange symptoms of distress, like paralyzed limbs 
with no physical cause. This led him toward the mind. The Victorian 
period was waning, sex was back in vogue. Then World War I put a 
focus on aggression. Freud concluded the two drives were basic. 
</P>
<P>
	A writer of clear and powerful prose, Freud reached  
practitioners and public alike. He organized a movement to spread 
his theories. 
</P>
<P>
	Timing, good writing and promotion. ``Those three coalesced,''  
said Michael Roth, curator of the Library of Congress exhibit 
``Sigmund Freud: Conflict and Culture'' now at the Jewish Museum in 
New York and headed to Vienna and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Freud applied his theories to other fields. He analyzed society  
and history, religion and art, morality and politics. 
</P>
<P>
	By midcentury, his influence and stature were clear -- placing  
him, according to one scholar's choice published in 1949, third 
among the 10 ``greats of our time,'' after Mohandas Gandhi and 
Albert Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
	The '50s and '60s were Freud's heyday in America.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was the only show in town,'' said Rosemarie Sand, a retired  
psychoanalyst in White Plains, N.Y. ``It was the answer to 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1970s, Freudian psychoanalysis, a process that may  
involve several sessions each week and take years, has been 
eclipsed in popularity by other forms of less costly and intensive 
psychotherapy and by drugs. Employers and health insurers no longer 
want to pay for unlimited therapy and many people lack the time or 
inclination. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguments over Freud continue to rage. Witness the controversy  
over the Library of Congress show, which opened last year in 
Washington after a two-year delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers blamed a lack of funding, but concern that it would  
be worshipful and one-sided prompted historian Peter Swales to 
circulate a petition in which 50 scholars and critics urged that 
the exhibit ``adequately reflect the full spectrum of informed 
opinion about the status of Freud's contribution to intellectual 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curator Roth, associate director of the Getty Research Institute  
for the History of Art and the Humanities in Los Angeles, said he 
had intended to consult Freud's critics before the petition, but 
the controversy made him more sensitive to it. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, emblazoned above the displays of letters and  
diaries and drafts in Freud's fluid, uphill script, are statements 
like feminist Germaine Greer's acid observation in 1970: ``Freud is 
the father of psychoanalysis. It had no mother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Swales questioned the entire discipline that  
Freud fathered. ``What are the benefits of 100 years of 
psychoanalysis?'' he said, speaking from his home in New York. The 
field that probes the mind is subject to fads, he said, noting 
current enthusiasm for drugs like Prozac, the world's best-selling 
antidepressant. ``The field of psychiatry is overpopulated with 
fashion victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, feminists were among those who brought Freud down  
from his pedestal, ridiculing ideas such as his theory that women 
are destined to be unhappy because they lack the physical apparatus 
of males. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women are quite right about Freud,'' said Mrs. Sand.  
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to a female friend Freud famously asked, ``What does  
a woman want?'' What a woman wants, said Mrs. Sand, is equal rights 
and fair treatment. ``Nowadays, your typical analyst, he's not 
going to hit her with penis envy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Decades earlier, Karen Horney, a prominent German-American  
psychiatrist, called Freud's theories on femininity male fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
	Freud ``did make a great contribution because he was the first  
one to talk about the sexuality of women,'' said Ruth Lax, an 
author, psychologist and analyst who teaches at Cornell Medical 
School. ``He didn't fully understand it, but he acknowledged it. 
That was a great step forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Freud's work was not about women, however, but about  
people in general. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout his life he revisited his theories, discarding,  
changing and trying out new ones. Like the patients he treated -- 
like the patients who today seek help from psychotherapists and 
analysts -- Freud was shaped by who he was, when and where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
	As his granddaughter Sophie Freud, a psychologist, has said of  
his theories: ``They should never be cast in cement; only religion 
does that. His work is a mixture of amazing leaps into the future, 
with other parts embedded in his own time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His ideas have provided a bedrock from which more modern theory  
has evolved, even though many were only grasped on a ``superficial 
... cocktail-party level,'' Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freud offered explanations for the everyday mysteries. For  
example, sibling rivalry. ``Everybody has known brothers and 
sisters don't always get along,'' Gay said. ``But he gives you ways 
of understanding how this might come about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Gay, ``Maybe one of the most important things he talks  
about is that people love and hate each other at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freud visited the United States just once. In September 1909 he  
spent a week at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., lecturing on 
psychoanalysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet it was this country that gave Freud's ideas their warmest  
embrace. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? Perhaps it's American insecurity, identity issues in a  
nation of immigrants, people always reinventing themselves; or, in 
a culture that exalts the striver, another way to seek personal and 
interpersonal perfection. 
</P>
<P>
	Freud, if he were alive today, might not recognize his legacy,  
much less approve. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet a direct lineage can be traced from the neurotic Europeans  
on Freud's couch -- really more of a chaise lounge draped with an 
oriental rug -- to today's walking wounded of America talking 
upright to psychotherapists about anything from childhood abuse to 
marriage troubles and alcoholism to neurotic pets. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, it's normal in much of the world to seek professional  
help for what ails the mind. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, psychologist Rika Kayama writes a magazine advice  
column and appears on TV variety and quiz shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In Scotland, two policewomen sent to the 1996 school massacre in  
the town of Dunblane, where 16 children and a teacher died, are 
suing their employers, claiming they didn't get enough counseling 
for stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people in India can afford psychotherapy, but they can call  
and seek advice from Dr. Broota, a popular voice on New Delhi 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia, where Freud's works were once banned and dissidents  
were tossed into psychiatric wards as punishment, people now clamor 
for therapy to cure stress, sex problems, alcoholism, drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, the Chinese used to denounce psychology as bourgeois  
and told the insane to improve their thinking by reading Mao 
Tse-tung. These days they worry about a therapist shortage. Many 
cities now offer counseling hotlines; Shanghai has at least nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Buenos Aires claims the world's highest per capita supply of  
psychoanalysts, many clustered in one part of town. It's called 
``Villa Freud.''

<HEADLINE> Government Padlocks Nevada Brothel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSTANG, Nev. (AP) -- When the government burned down Joe  
Conforte's bordello, he just bought another one. When the IRS 
seized that one for taxes and auctioned it, Conforte bought back 
the $5 million-a-year operation on the sly. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with Conforte on the lam and the payoffs that helped keep  
it open dried up, the Mustang Ranch is on the verge of being 
padlocked. For good. 
</P>
<P>
	The bordello's court-ordered closure Monday will end a colorful  
chapter in Nevada history -- while cutting $230,000 from tiny Storey 
County's budget and throwing about 70 legal prostitutes out of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad situation because you're going to have prostitutes  
on the streets in Reno like you do in Las Vegas,'' former Mustang 
manager and county Commissioner Shirley Colletti said. Prostitution 
is legal in Storey County but illegal in Reno and surrounding 
Washoe County. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of the Mustang Ranch is the story of Conforte, a  
squat, cigar-puffing, raspy-voiced Sicilian immigrant who landed in 
Oakland, Calif., in 1950, and supplemented his cab driver's income 
by pointing men to prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	He opened his own brothels in Northern California before moving  
to less fussy Nevada. There, he teamed up with veteran madam Jesse 
Sally Burgess to operate the Triangle Ranch near Wadsworth, 30 
miles east of Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	When Washoe County District Attorney Bill Raggio tried to close  
the place down, Conforte moved it just outside the county. Their 
battle led to a feeble extortion plot in 1959 in which Conforte 
accused Raggio of plying a woman under 18 with liquor in a 
seduction attempt. Conforte didn't know Raggio was taping the 
conversation, which sent him to jail for extortion. 
</P>
<P>
	While Conforte was in prison, a judge declared the Triangle  
Ranch a public nuisance and it was burned down in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Conforte and Burgess bought the nearby Mustang Ranch,  
where a buzzer let visitors through a gate in a 10-foot fence and 
also signaled the prostitutes to line up in the red-wallpapered 
lobby for pairing off. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government kept the heat on Conforte's tendency to  
overlook paying taxes until he fled to Brazil in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he cut a deal with the U.S. government to testify that he  
bribed U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne in an effort to stay out 
of prison. Claiborne was removed from the bench and imprisoned. 
Conforte was back at the Mustang after a year behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, he and Burgess declared bankruptcy and the IRS seized  
the Mustang Ranch and sold it at a tax auction. 
</P>
<P>
	A brother of Conforte's lawyer made the lone bid and snapped it  
up for $1.49 million -- a tenth of the back taxes. Conforte said he 
had no part in the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Storey County Commission met to consider whether to  
allow prostitution to resume at the 104-room brothel, Conforte, 
then listed only as the manager, made the issue moot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We reopened this morning,'' he announced. ``I'm not here to  
ask for a license. I'm here as a common courtesy to this board to 
tell you how it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, with the federal government still after him for taxes,  
Conforte fled to South America again while remaining on retainer 
with the Mustang management as a $10,000-a-month consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony at a trial last month alleged that 10 times that  
amount was siphoned from the brothel to South America. 
</P>
<P>
	That trial also confirmed that Ms. Colletti was on the payroll  
as manager while serving as a county commissioner. A jury convicted 
her of conspiring with two shell companies to conceal Conforte as 
the true owner of the $5 million-a-year operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the conviction, U.S. District Court Judge Howard  
McKibben ordered the brothel closed at 5 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	While other county officials have denied receiving tributes, the  
brothel has helped out in other ways. A school bus was bought for 
the county, there were almost unquestioned handouts to anybody 
asking for them, and reduced rent for the needy at a Mustang-owned 
trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have been a very good neighbor to us. They've donated  
thousands of dollars to the community,'' said county commission 
vice-chairman Carl Trink at a meeting to debate how to absorb the 
loss of revenue generated by the brothel. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who find the brothel morally offensive are just glad to  
see it go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to see this historic day as the beginning of the  
end of the brothels in Nevada,'' said Barbara Jones, a member of 
the Sunrise Fellowship and Point of Grace in Reno.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges $120M for Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton promoted a support  
system to help youngsters graduate from ``the playground to the 
college classroom,'' announcing $120 million in grants Saturday 
intended to put higher education within their reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as ``Operation Gear Up'' gets under way, Clinton said it is  
threatened by the Republicans' $792 billion tax-cut package. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should decide on this big tax cut and just  
hope there's enough left over to pay for education and to save 
Social Security and Medicare and pay off our national debt,'' the 
president said in his weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is not the time to turn our backs on our children's  
future,'' he said. ``As far as we've come, we know, still, there is 
much to do -- for too many children, especially in economically 
distressed communities, aren't getting the chance to reach their 
highest potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he will ask the Republican-controlled Congress to  
double the financial commitment to the program ``so that we can 
reach more of our children than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To really make a difference in disadvantaged children's lives,  
we must instill in them the unshakable belief that if they work 
hard, they will be able to go on to college,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP, through House Republican Conference chairman J.C.  
Watts, R-Okla., accused the president of misleading the people 
about the Republicans' tax plan. ``The debate over education is not 
about money but control. The choice is between Washington 
bureaucrats or parents, teachers and local leaders,'' Watts said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very same tax relief package the president criticized  
today will make college more affordable by expanding popular 
prepaid tuition plans. The package also increases the amount of 
money parents can save for their children's education in tax-free 
savings accounts and makes these funds available for primary and 
secondary education costs as well as college.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, Arkansas' former governor, is spending the  
weekend in Little Rock. Also Saturday, he spoke at a poor community 
in the Arkansas Delta and planned to appear Saturday evening with 
Vice President Gore at a fund-raiser for Gore's presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said ``Operation Gear Up'' will create hundreds of  
partnerships between universities, colleges, communities and 
middle- and junior-high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to make contact with youngsters no later than the  
seventh grade and provide mentors ``who encourage them to have high 
hopes and expectations for themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative also seeks to ensure schools offer classes to  
prepare young people for college entrance examinations and that 
families get help in figuring out how to pay for college. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he wants to build on current efforts to encourage  
national teaching standards and to increase scholarship funds for 
tuition tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of these efforts,'' the president said, ``more young  
people have the chance to make the most of their God-given 
abilities and take their places in the high-tech world of the 21st 
century.''

<HEADLINE> Braves' Perez Begins Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Braves catcher Eddie Perez withdrew his appeal of  
a four-game suspension and began serving the penalty Saturday, 
forcing Atlanta to recall Pascual Matos from Triple-A Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves optioned first baseman Randall Simon to Richmond,  
where he will have to spend a minimum of 10 days. Since Atlanta 
carries only two catchers on its 25-man roster and a suspended 
player can't be replaced, Matos was needed as a backup to Greg 
Myers. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez was suspended and fined $1,000 for triggering a brawl in a  
game with the Philadelphia Phillies on July 30. He originally 
appealed the suspension, but decided it was futile to wait for a 
hearing in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Better to do it now than later,'' Perez said prior to  
Saturday's game against the San Francisco Giants. ``I don't think 
I'm going to get any less than four games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the hearing would not have been held until the Braves  
visited New York the final week of the regular season for a 
three-game series against the Mets. Prior to Saturday's games, New 
York led the Braves by 1 1/2 games in the NL East. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people told me I might get one game less if I waited  
until we got to New York,'' Perez said. ``But I can't take a 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brawl began after Phillies pitcher Paul Byrd hit Perez in  
the third inning, the second time in less than a week that Byrd hit 
his former teammate with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The following inning, the pair exchanged words when Byrd came to  
the plate. Perez threw a punch, setting off the brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Braves manager Bobby Cox drew a two-game suspension, which he  
served, for his actions in the same game. Cox returned to the field 
after being ejected in the previous inning for arguing a 
double-play call. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, who will miss the final two games of the Giants' series  
and the first two games of a three-game series with the Houston 
Astros, said he doesn't hold a grudge against Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be all right,'' Perez said. ``He's still my friend.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Possible Buyers Say No to Examiner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- With two potential buyers turning down the  
chance to buy the San Francisco Examiner, newspaper analysts, 
journalists and readers are predicting that the paper and its bold 
headlines and raucous style will become another casualty in an 
American institution: the afternoon newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper's parent company, The Hearst Corp., announced Friday  
that it would buy the larger San Francisco Chronicle. The Chronicle 
reported the sale was for $660 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Hearst will buy the Chronicle and then put the  
Examiner up for sale. If Hearst can't find a buyer for its 
afternoon paper, it will combine them into a morning daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about the future is rampant in the Bay Area. Would a  
marriage of the restrained Chronicle and the scrappy Examiner be 
happy? Would the lost competition be offset by the increased 
resources of a unified paper? 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to have the choice,'' said Frank Ingram, a sales  
representative who works in San Francisco. ``Every time we lose a 
paper, we lose another piece of our country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others are optimistic that a richer newspaper would be  
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe for the first time in decades people will take San  
Francisco journalism seriously,'' said Examiner reporter Marsha 
Ginsberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have long complained that the Chronicle is too staid and  
the Examiner too thin. The Chronicle is the 12th largest newspaper 
in the country, with 482,000 daily readers. The Examiner has 
115,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives from two local competitors, Knight Ridder and  
MediaNews Group, said they are not interested in buying. Knight 
Ridder owns the San Jose Mercury News and Contra Costa Newspapers 
group. MediaNews owns five smaller Bay Area newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There simply isn't enough demand for the print medium to  
justify having two papers,'' said Charles Baird, an economist at 
California State University, Hayward. Long commutes, television 
news and declining mass transit have killed many afternoon papers. 
</P>
<P>
	History is not on the Examiner's side. Although most American  
cities once had several newspapers, only 47 still have two or more 
dailies. Afternoon papers from San Diego to Milwaukee to Pittsburgh 
have closed, although they still outnumber morning papers 781 to 
721. 
</P>
<P>
	As in several other two-paper cities, the Chronicle and Examiner  
share business operations to cut costs. During the past 15 years, 
similar arrangements have been terminated in 12 cities. Only once, 
in St. Louis, did the second paper get purchased. It lingered two 
years before folding. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the Examiner's fate, local journalists say they will  
miss the unflagging rivalry between the city's two venerable 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the Yankees selling to the Mets,'' said Carl Hall, a  
union leader and science writer for the Chronicle. ``I have a hard 
time thinking of myself as a Met. But at least we're not out on the 
street.''

<HEADLINE> Joe DiMaggio's Only Child Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio Jr., the troubled son of the baseball Hall of Famer  
and a pallbearer at his father's funeral in March, died at a 
hospital in Antioch, Calif., apparently of natural causes, 
relatives and hospital officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, 57, was not breathing and had no heartbeat when he was  
brought by ambulance to Sutter Delta Medical Center late Friday 
night, hospital spokeswoman Nancy Monfort said. Attempts at 
resuscitation were unsuccessful and he died about 11:25 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Monfort said the cause of death was not known, it was  
believed to be from natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was the only child of Joe DiMaggio and Dorothy Arnold,  
an actress whom the elder DiMaggio married in 1939 and divorced 
five years later. The elder DiMaggio did not have any children with 
his second wife, Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Jr., who struggled with substance abuse and homelessness  
during the last two decades, was estranged from his father and saw 
him infrequently in recent years. He was divorced and had two 
adopted daughters who were doted upon by their grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Amato Goodman, a cousin whose son was a close friend of  
DiMaggio, said the son was unable to cope with his father's fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a brilliant mind. He was one of the intelligentsia,''  
Goodman said. ``He lived in the shadow of his father and could not 
rise above that. 
</P>
<P>
	``He marched to a different drummer. He was very sensitive to  
the people close to him,'' she said. ``He really was not a bad boy. 
He was confused about a lot of issues in his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris Engelberg, a close friend and attorney for the elder  
DiMaggio, said, ``It's very sad. He loved his father. He turned 
down a seven-figure offer to do a book about Joe, as much as he 
could have used the money. He was broke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg said Joe Jr. had suffered from asthma.  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio attended Yale, but dropped out to enroll in the  
Marines. In the mid-1970s, he had a blood clot removed from his 
head following a car accident. During the past two decades, he 
battled drug and alcohol problems. He often lived alone on the 
street, and took shelter at one point in a trucking container. For 
a while, he was the manager of a trucking company in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1995, he fractured his leg when the bicycle he was  
riding hit a van. He had a permanent limp after the accident, and 
was cited by the California Highway Patrol for operating a bicycle 
under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph DiMaggio Jr.'s middle name was Paul, the same as his  
father and uncles, Vince and Dominic, both of whom also played in 
the major leagues. Joe DiMaggio Sr. once explained, ``Saint Paul 
was my father's favorite saint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger DiMaggio and his wife, Susan, adopted daughters  
Paula and Katherine in the 1960s, but the marriage collapsed after 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder DiMaggio set up a trust fund that was to pay his son  
$20,000 a year. The bequest, in a will signed May 21, 1996, 
appeared to be the smallest gift in the document, which also 
established trust funds for DiMaggio's two grandchildren and four 
great-grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Neo Nazis Cancel Rally to Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A neo-Nazi group abruptly canceled its planned  
rally Saturday in the nation's capital even though the city closed 
a number of streets and spent an estimated $1 million on police to 
protect them, Metropolitan Police Chief Charles Ramsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four members of the Knights of Freedom Nationalist Party showed  
up to take part in the march in support of an Aryan homeland, 
Ramsey said. They told police who were to escort them to the 
beginning of the parade route that they would not march, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The march was canceled because of huge counter demonstrations  
were planned and ``the media worked this thing up into a frenzy,'' 
said Jeff Krause, executive vice president of the group that has 
recently started calling itself the American Nationalist Party. 
``We did not want any of our people hurt,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group had a permit -- obtained under the name Knights of  
Freedom Nationalist Party -- that would have allowed up to 300 
supporters to march six blocks along Pennsylvania Avenue and hold a 
rally in Lafayette Square -- the tiny park across the street from 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department said Ramsey  
will ask the district's legal staff to sue the American Nationalist 
Party, a name recently taken by the small group formerly known the 
Knights of Freedom, to recover the costs incurred for providing 
security for the march and several counter protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the media is to blame, Krause said, a suit against the  
party would be unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	City police and the United States Park Police deployed nearly  
2,000 police officers in riot gear in the downtown area to deal 
with potential problems that never materialized. ``There also is an 
expectation that if you are going to do this sort of thing that you 
follow through,'' Ramsey said noting that personnel and equipment 
costs could exceed $1 million. ``The taxpayers ought to be 
reimbursed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had worked on plans for controlling the neo-Nazi  
demonstration and several counter protests for more than six weeks. 
Portions of more than a dozen city blocks were closed for much of 
Saturday afternoon. ``Our plan of action included street closures 
for the safety of the public,'' said Sgt. Robert McClean, a 
spokesman for the U.S. Park Police, which has jurisdiction in the 
vicinity of the White House. The area of blocked off to general 
public access was similar to the security perimeter put in place 
for the NATO meeting earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also used steel barricades to divide Lafayette Park into  
two fenced perimeters where opposing demonstrators could express 
their views had Saturday's demonstrations gone off as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shut them down cold today, and that's exactly what we set  
out to do, '' said Rami Elamine, an organizer of D.C. United to 
Stop the Nazi's. The ad hoc coalition of community groups marched 
six blocks to Lafayette Square and held a noisy anti-Nazi rally 
that became a victory celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand how all this ignorance festers,'' said Josh  
Trapp of Jackson, Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	At another counter-rally at the Lincoln Memorial, Mayor Anthony  
Williams called the planned neo-Nazi march a ``chilling reminder'' 
that at the start of the new millennium people still want to spread 
hate. 
</P>
<P>
	There are still people who think their ``skin color gives them a  
mandate'' to exclude others, Williams said. ``We must speak up and 
we must speak out against hate now and always,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton blasted the neo-Nazis as ``the  
ugliest part of America.''

<HEADLINE> Wright Headed to Clippers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Lorenzen Wright, the center-forward from the Los  
Angeles Clippers who was contemplating a job with the Lakers, 
instead will be traded to the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday for two No. 1 
picks, The Associated Press learned Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two NBA sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed  
the trade. Atlanta will give up its own No. 1 pick and one 
originally belonging to Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, who turned down a $30 million, six-year offer to stay  
with the Clippers, should get similar money from the Hawks. Atlanta 
is over the salary cap, but has a trade exception worth $4.4 
million that it can use in this deal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the 6-foot-11 Wright was reportedly contemplating a  
one-year, $2 million offer from the Lakers, which came as shocking 
news to the Pacers and Hawks -- both of who were trying to get 
Wright in a sign-and-trade deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks and Clippers had discussed a Jim Jackson-for-Wright  
deal early last week, but Atlanta decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
	But when given a chance to get the three-year veteran for the  
price of two draft picks, the Hawks decided to do it. Atlanta had 
four No. 1 picks this year and kept three of the players -- guard 
Jason Terry, center-forward Cal Bowlder and guard Dion Glover. 
</P>
<P>
	With the fourth pick, the Hawks drafted forward Jumaine Jones  
but immediately traded his rights to Philadelphia for a future No. 
1 that initially belonged to Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	That pick will be sent to the Clippers along with the Hawks' top  
selection in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta called a news conference for Sunday morning, but a team  
spokesman would not reveal the announcement. A Clippers spokesman 
could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Wright gives the Hawks some depth and security  
along the front line. Alan Henderson, last season's starting power 
forward, missed the playoffs with an eye injury that has been slow 
to heal. His backup, Grant Long, is a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	After being swept in the second round of the playoffs by the  
Knicks, Atlanta has been one of the busiest teams during the 
offseason. The Hawks traded their starting backcourt, sending point 
guard Mookie Blaylock to Golden State for the pick that landed 
Terry, and Steve Smith, their leading scorer four years in a row, 
to the Portland Trail Blazers for Isaiah Rider and Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers have already lost free agents Rodney Rogers and  
Darrick Martin without getting anything in return, although they 
did pull off a sign-and-trade deal with Cleveland in which they 
received Derek Anderson and Johnny Newman in exchange for Lamond 
Murray. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles did manage to re-sign shooting guard Eric  
Piatkowski, but Sherman Douglas and Tyrone Nesby remain free 
agents. The Clippers have the right to match any offer made to 
Nesby. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright averaged 6.6 points and 7.5 rebounds last season,  
splitting time at center with rookie Michael Olowokandi and at 
forward with Maurice Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old made it clear to the Clippers that he did not  
want to continue playing for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft pick that originally belonged to Toronto is lottery  
protected, meaning the Raptors will keep it unless they make the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto first traded the pick to the Knicks for John Wallace,  
and New York sent it to Philadelphia for Mirsad Turkcan.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Tries To Take Over Brickyard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The roar of engines can be heard several  
blocks away from Indianapolis Motor Speedway. It's not the 
high-pitched wail that penetrates the neighborhood in May, but a 
deep, raspy whine that carries a message of change. 
</P>
<P>
	From Indiana's favorite racing sons to the folks who live a  
stone's throw from the speedway, the old Brickyard is rounding up 
stock-car converts at an astounding rate. It's summertime, which 
means Indy becomes NASCAR country. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years after the good ol' boys first fired up their noisy  
engines here in 1994, the Brickyard 400 has done more than find a 
niche in the Camelot of racing. These guys look like they're taking 
over the place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to be where the action is, and the biggest  
action is in NASCAR,'' said John Andretti, whose family name has 
been synonymous with Indianapolis for decades. ``That's probably 
the biggest reason why you see us come down here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brickyard 400 is still second to the Daytona 500 on NASCAR's  
list of prestige and winnings; the purse for Saturday's race will 
be $6.1 million, compared with $7.3 million at Daytona earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the race attracts so many fans, merchandise sales and  
interest that it is making a strong bid to unseat the Indy 500 as 
the biggest race in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you guys have any doubt in your mind that this is the  
biggest race in our minds right now?'' asked Tony Stewart, another 
Indiana native who has fled the fractured world of American 
open-wheel racing for the riches and recognition of NASCAR's 
Winston Cup series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know ever since I was born, I can remember coming to the  
Speedway,'' Stewart said. ``And you always dreamed that someday you 
could be the first one to the checkered flag here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Stewart and Andretti, Jeff Gordon and Kenny Irwin dreamed  
about racing at Indy during the time they spent in Indiana. All of 
them are here in gaudy stock cars instead of the sleek open-wheel 
machines they were trained to drive as they rose through Indiana's 
racing ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	And they understand the explosiveness of the issue concerning  
who rules the Brickyard after American open-wheel racing split into 
two divisions -- CART and the Indy Racing League. 
</P>
<P>
	All but the outspoken Andretti were silent when asked about how  
Indy and racing have changed since NASCAR showed up here in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nope,'' Gordon said with a smile when asked if he'd like to  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The media and race fans around here are not nearly as guarded.  
</P>
<P>
	``NASCAR's more fan friendly,'' said Lisa Scott, sitting on her  
sister's lawn across the street from the speedway. ``The 500, 
they've just become too big for their britches, if you ask me. They 
cater to the richest people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce Scott, who has lived on 28th Street, in sight of the  
speedway for 16 years, said, ``I'd rather go to the Brickyard than 
the 500.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stock car racing gets strong TV ratings in Indy, too. The  
Indianapolis market was third in ratings for the 1999 Daytona 500 
and first for Winston Cup's Atlanta race. It was first for the last 
two Brickyard 400s, and consistently pulls top-five ratings for 
Winston Cup races. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR memorabilia sales, known for their relentless strength,  
have taken over the streets around the speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see Dale Earnhardt bring in eight transporters with  
his clothing and memorabilia, that's pretty big,'' said Fred 
Nation, the speedway's vice president for corporate communications. 
</P>
<P>
	All this led the Indianapolis Star to proclaim this week that  
the Brickyard 400 ``has shoved the Indianapolis 500 into secondary 
status.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nation disputes this, pointing out that the Indy 500 still draws  
a bigger crowd, better local TV ratings and far more international 
interest than the Brickyard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Indy 500 is an event that lasts more than two weeks,''  
Nation said. ``The Brickyard 400 is a three-day event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the extent of NASCAR's success in the heartland was never  
more evident than on Friday morning, when the four Winston Cup 
drivers with Indiana ties gathered in one room to trade quips and 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say even winning a go-cart race here would be the biggest  
thing,'' said Irwin, a Winston Cup rookie and Indianapolis native. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to name their favorite Indiana tracks and race cars, none  
of the drivers came up with what used to be the obvious answer -- 
Indy-cars at Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stock car, Indianapolis,'' Gordon said. ``I thought that was  
an easy question.''

<HEADLINE>  Saints Already Nursing Wounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) -- New Orleans Saints coach Mike Ditka went  
into training camp saying he wanted his team to be tough and 
hard-hitting with a nasty attitude. He was referring to the games, 
though, not the practice field. 
</P>
<P>
	With their first exhibition game still almost a week away, the  
Saints on Saturday were already nursing wounds inflicted by another 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Keith Poole's nose was broken, his left eye was  
purple and swollen closed. It took six stitches to close cuts above 
and below it, inflicted Friday during a melee that culminated a day 
of brawls in two practice sessions with the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Poole said, and television footage appeared to confirm, that  
Chiefs free safety Jerome Woods hit him late. When Poole turned to 
confront Woods, Kansas City cornerback Chris Dishman grabbed Poole, 
pinned his arms back and stripped off Poole's helmet. A moment 
later, Chiefs cornerback Carlton Gray dove over Poole's back and 
hit him in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches separated the players and called off the rest of  
practice, but as the teams left the field, Poole challenged Gray, 
nearly touching off another brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I shouldn't have done it,'' Poole said Saturday. ``But it was  
a cheap shot and the guy knows it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scrimmage planned for Saturday morning was canceled.  
</P>
<P>
	Friday night, additional police were dispatched to the cafeteria  
where the teams ate dinner before the Saints returned to La Crosse. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there were no serious injuries from the fights, Ditka  
implied that Chiefs coaches encouraged their players to 
deliberately hurt people and his players had to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you going to tell your guys, `Just take what they give  
you. Let them hit you in the back, take their helmets off and swing 
them at you.''' Ditka said. ``That's bull. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tried to hit our top running back (Ricky Williams), when  
the play is over, and to have one of their coaches say, ``Take him 
out,' from what I understand. I don't know if I can say that for 
sure, but I heard that. That bothers me. Then again, I guess you 
consider the source.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka said one of his coaches told him the Chief's coaches were  
telling their players to take Williams out. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive lineman Kyle Turley also said it was a hit on Williams  
that set off the chain of events. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took a couple of cheap shots at Ricky, and that's not  
right,'' Turley said. ``No. 97 (Ty Parten) had some cheap shots on 
Ricky, he tackled him when he was in the middle of a pile. We 
started making plays on them, and they started taking people out. 
We were just defending ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiefs general manager Carl Peterson said no one was to blame,  
but Saints defensive line coach Walt Corey said Chiefs first-year 
coach Gunther Cunningham failed to control his team after fights 
erupted throughout the morning session. 
</P>
<P>
	``The person in charge over there is to blame,'' Corey said,  
indicating the Chiefs. ``Whoever's in charge is in total control. 
It was supposed to be a practice, not a fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham apparently tried to stop the fights. He loudly  
scolded his team after Kansas City tackle Marcus Spears used his 
helmet to hit Saints defensive end Brady Smith in the back of the 
head during one brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the players that we weren't going to play like this and  
it just kept escalating,'' said Cunningham, who sent Spears to the 
locker room after the incident. ``I tried to calm them down and we 
said if it didn't we were going to stop practice. I looked at Mike 
and he said he felt the same way, so we stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spears later apologized for his actions.  
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize to this organization and the team because you  
can't have that,'' he said. ``In the heat of battle, things are 
going on. But you've got to keep your composure and I lost my 
composure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka said he had not heard from the league and did not know if  
there would be any sanctions or investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our guys stuck together,'' Ditka said. ``I like that, and I  
can't stand up and be too critical of that, and I'm not going to be 
critical of them. What we did, we did in defense. I didn't think we 
precipitated any of it. That makes a difference. ... We were the 
guys that just reciprocated. Maybe we shouldn't have done that but 
we did. We fought back.''

<HEADLINE> Coin Could Fetch Million-Dollar Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOLFEBORO, N.H. (AP) -- To the inexperienced eye, it's an old  
silver dollar. But to collectors, it's the Mona Lisa, the king of 
U.S. coins, the Holy Grail. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a pristine silver dollar dated 1804, and it's expected to  
attract bids of around $2 million at auction this month in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	``To a coin collector, this is something to say, 'Gosh, I've  
seen it,''' said Q. David Bowers, chairman of the Wolfeboro-based 
Auctions by Bowers and Merena. ``Someone might travel a thousand 
miles to see one, for example, in the Smithsonian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coin was minted specially for a secret mission to the Middle  
and Far East, part of a set of U.S. coins presented to the Sultan 
of Muscat (now Oman) as a gift for a trade treaty and pampered for 
more than a century and a half. A second set went to the King of 
Siam, now Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sultan of Muscat dollar was one of eight such coins made in  
1834 -- despite the 1804 date -- and shortly after and is in the best 
condition of the group, by far, Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, all along the way it's been handled with the  
proverbial kid gloves,'' Bowers said. ``There is not a scratch or a 
mark on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other seven are in private collections or museums. Other  
``1804'' dollars were made in later years, but are not as notable 
as the original eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Collectors began calling Sultan of Muscat silver dollar the King  
of U.S. coins in the 1880s, Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is to numismatists (coin collectors) as, let's say, the  
Mona Lisa is to art,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is part of a collection of nearly 1,000 coins up for auction  
by Bowers and Merena on Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowers and Merena auctioned another of the original eight 1804  
silver dollars in 1997 for $1.8 million, the highest price ever 
paid for a coin. The Sultan of Muscat dollar is in better 
condition, said Raymond Merena, the company president. 
</P>
<P>
	``This coin is probably the biggest of the big deal coins,''  
said Kenneth Bressett, editor of ``A Guide Book of United States 
Coins'' and co-author of ``The Fantastic 1804 Dollar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story of the coin began with then-President Andrew Jackson's  
desire in the 1830s to win trade treaties in the Middle and Far 
East, where America was shut out by European nations. 
</P>
<P>
	A Portsmouth sea trader, Edmund Roberts, got himself appointed a  
special agent for a secret mission to rulers in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	He won trade treaties from the sultan and the king of Siam, and  
on a return trip with the ratified treaties Roberts carried gifts, 
including special presentation sets of U.S. coins ordered by 
Jackson for the two monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
	No silver dollars had been struck since 1803, but the U.S. Mint  
still had 1804-dated dies so it used them for new coins. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowers learned they almost didn't survive the trip. In the  
auction catalog, he writes that Roberts' ship, the USS Peacock, ran 
aground and was attacked by pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a truly harrowing adventure, Roberts and a few others were  
able to row to safety, narrowly escaping pursuing pirates, while 
the Peacock was left behind,'' he wrote. The ship was later 
refloated.

<HEADLINE> Ocean Marathon Winner Sets Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- David Meca-Medina, the second-ranked  
swimmer in the world, won Saturday's Ocean Marathon with more than 
five minutes to spare, eclipsing the course record by six seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Meca-Medina, of Spain, was a favorite to win the 22-mile race  
around Absecon Island along with top-ranked Stephane Lecat, who 
dropped out about three hours into the trip. Meca-Medina finished 
in six hours, 56 minutes and 43 seconds to win the $4,200 purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Andre Wilde, was second after finishing in 7:02.17.  
Slovenian Igor Majcen, who completed the course in 7:07.26 seconds, 
was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 25 swimmers who began Saturday morning -- 12 women and 13  
men -- only 21 finished. Three of the four dropouts were men, 
including sixth-ranked Christof Wandratch of Germany, who said he'd 
failed to train enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could get seasick. You could take a bad gulp of salt  
water. You could get a jellyfish sting,'' said race spokeswoman 
Lauralee Dobbins. ``People have dropped out because of hypothermia 
and sometimes they get beaten up by the tides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbins said seas were calm Saturday morning, speeding the  
beginning of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't really meet any ferocious tides or currents until  
the last hour,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	First-time racer Gabe Lindsay, of Oviedo, Fla., took fourth  
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy went out like a madman, way ahead of all the pros,''  
said race director Sid Cassidy. ``He absolutely astounded me.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Fired 32 for Misconduct in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of FBI employees fired for  
misconduct rose from 19 to 32 between 1997 and 1998. The bureau 
says swifter completion of more internal investigations was the 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
	In its annual report Friday, the bureau's Office of Professional  
Responsibility said that 301 employees received discipline ranging 
from oral reprimands to dismissal in 1998, compared with 212 the 
preceding year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is premature to describe the increase as a trend,'' the  
FBI's internal watchdog office said. ``The increase in employees 
disciplined is attributable in part to increased efficiency in the 
disciplinary process'' because more agents were assigned to the 
watchdog office. 
</P>
<P>
	The expanded office completed 528 investigations during 1998,  
compared to only 399 in 1997. The report also said the backlog of 
cases open for more than a year was reduced from 24.3 percent of 
the outstanding total at the end of fiscal 1997 to 16.7 percent at 
the end of fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most notable 1998 cases, special agent Daron  
Council of New Orleans was accused of attempting to extort money 
from a drug dealer. After an investigation, Council was arrested, 
fired and pleaded guilty to two counts of soliciting and accepting 
a bribe. He was sentenced to 16 months in prison and fined $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Other FBI employees were fired for lying to internal  
investigators, unauthorized disclosures, unprofessional conduct, 
misuse of government property, drunk driving, drug abuse, sexual 
harassment, misuse of a bureau position, theft or embezzlement of 
government property and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 301 employees disciplined in 1998 represented just under  
half the 615 employees whose investigations for serious misconduct 
were completed that year. The 301 include 140 agents and 161 
support workers and comprise 1.1 percent of the bureau's total 
workforce. Of the 32 fired, 11 were agents and 21 support workers. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, the 212 disciplined in 1997 included 99 agents  
and 113 support workers and comprised 0.8 percent of the workforce 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1998, six employees were demoted, 60 were suspended  
without pay for 15 or more days, 94 were suspended without pay for 
14 or fewer days, five were put on probation, 64 were censured, and 
40 received oral reprimands. 
</P>
<P>
	An increasing number of allegations of domestic violence by FBI  
workers is being reported as more and more local police use arrests 
rather than conciliation to resolve such incidents, the Office of 
Professional Responsibility said. ``Allegations regarding such 
abuse have included agent and support employees, males and females, 
spouses and unmarried persons and children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which was distributed to all FBI employees, warned:  
``A criminal assault in the home is conduct far beneath the 
standards the FBI expects of its employees and is treated as 
serious misconduct. ... Discipline may be imposed even if a local 
criminal conviction does not result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI Director Louis Freeh has more than doubled the staff at the  
Office of Professional Responsibility since 1997, and Justice 
Department Inspector General Michael Bromwich said last week it has 
become more professional. But Bromwich said the bureau needs a 
permanent outside watchdog agency whose investigations he said 
would have greater deterrent effect and more public credibility 
than internal reviews.

<HEADLINE> De Ferran, Moore Ink Penske Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The decision to drive for Roger Penske, while  
emotional, was a no-brainer for both Gil de Ferran and Greg Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Penske ended weeks of rumors this weekend by announcing he had  
signed both drivers to three-year contracts to begin with his CART 
Indy-car racing team in 2000. They will replace Al Unser Jr., who 
has driven for Penske since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it is some great news as far as my career is  
concerned,'' De Ferran said Saturday, prior to qualifying for the 
Tenneco Automotive Grand Prix of Detroit. ``I'm joining one of the 
legendary teams in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penske Racing, founded in 1969, is the winningest team in FedEx  
Championship series history with 99 victories, including 10 
Indianapolis 500 wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``No driver in his right mind would fail to take that into  
serious consideration,'' De Ferran said. 
</P>
<P>
	Which might explain why some of the most famous names in racing  
have driven for Penske. They include Gary Bettenhausen, Bobby 
Allison, Tom Sneva, Mario Andretti, Rick Mears, Bobby Unser, Al 
Unser -- Little Al's father -- Emerson Fittipaldi and Paul Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something you can tell your grandkids,'' De Ferran said.  
``You can say, `I drove for Penske once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Ferran and Moore were two of the hottest free-agents on the  
circuit because their contracts were about to expire with their 
current teams. De Ferran, a Brazilian born in France, is leaving 
Walker Racing while Moore, a Canadian, is leaving Players Forsythe 
Racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making the decision to leave the team was one of the most  
difficult decisions I've had to make in my life,'' Moore said. ``It 
was kind of like splitting up with a girlfriend that you've been 
with for five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Ferran, 32, has earned poles at Japan and Toronto this  
season, and won the race at Portland. He heads into Sunday's race 
in seventh place in the driver standings. Since joining CART in 
1995, he has six poles and three victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, the 24-year-old Canadian who gained prominence with the  
Player's Forsythe team, won from the pole at the season-opener at 
Homestead.

	``It was a decision that me and my dad thought about and thought  
about,'' Moore said. ``We're not parting enemies. We still have 
eight or nine races to go this year. I'm looking for a few more 
wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore is eighth in the standings heading into Sunday's race.  
Moore has five poles and five victories in four years of CART 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
	The parting between Penske and Unser also was amicable.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, it was tough, but we just decided a change of scenery is  
good,'' Unser said. ``De Ferran and Moore are both great race car 
drivers. The surprise wasn't that Roger went with them, but that he 
went with a single car this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unser is rumored to be heading to the rival IRL, but declined to  
discuss his future until after his divorce proceedings are final, 
perhaps in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser, who has 31 victories in 266 career starts, hasn't won in  
almost four years. In 10 races this season, his top finish is fifth 
at Cleveland. In his last start, he completed 206 of 250 laps 
before retiring with engine problems at Michigan Speedway, 
finishing 13th in the U.S. 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had great success,'' Unser said. ``The last three years,  
we just haven't been able to achieve this success and maintain 
it.''

<HEADLINE> New Dictionary Offers New Age Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The first new English dictionary in 30 years is a  
tickety-boo venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickety-boo?  
</P>
<P>
	That's a British and Canadian word meaning ``perfectly fine''  
and it is found in the Encarta World English Dictionary, which is 
based on a global perception of English. 
</P>
<P>
	Encarta is the first full dictionary of the computer age, said  
Anne Soukhanov, the U.S. general editor of the dictionary, who also 
is the ``Word Watch'' columnist for The Atlantic Monthly. It is 
being published in print and electronically on CD-ROM by Microsoft 
and Bloomsbury Publishing of London. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sea change in dictionary making. This couldn't have  
been done five years ago,'' Soukhanov said. The dictionary shares 
its name with Microsoft's Encarta encyclopedia on CD-ROM and DVD. 
</P>
<P>
	There are eight versions of the dictionary -- Britain and  
Ireland; United States; Canada; Caribbean; Africa; South Asia; East 
Asia; and Australia and New Zealand -- and each contains many local 
usages. 
</P>
<P>
	But the local words considered most likely to be encountered by  
a traveler or browser were included in all versions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the dictionaries of the future will have to include  
words from around the world, given the way things have changed,'' 
Soukhanov said, referring to Internet use and wider international 
travel and commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those expressions are the Canadian ``slob ice,'' the  
slush that forms as snow melts on roadways; the Australian ``tall 
poppy syndrome,'' relating to public figures who loom large and the 
tendency by the media to want to knock them down; ``bangbelly,'' a 
piece of fried dough in Canada; ``toenadering,'' a gathering of 
political parties in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market contributed the phrase ``dead cat bounce,''  
meaning false signals of a stock recovery brought on by a group 
buying into the stock to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Encarta is the first new English dictionary since 1969, when the  
American Heritage Dictionary was published as a response to what 
was viewed as the too-liberal treatment of language by the 
Merriam-Webster's Third New World Dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
	Entries for the dictionary, which runs 2,074 pages on paper,  
were compiled by 320 editors who used computers and communicated by 
e-mail as they combed usages in the 74 countries where English is 
spoken. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a big difference from only a few years ago, when such  
work was done by hand on 3x5 cards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel as though I have moved from the Kitty Hawk to the space  
shuttle Columbia,'' said Soukhanov. 
</P>
<P>
	Encarta is selling in the United States for $50 in the print  
version and will cost $34.95 on CD-ROM, which will be available 
Aug. 27.

<P>
	A sampling of comments made or inspired by Sigmund Freud:  

</P>
<P>
	``Nothing can be brought to an end in the unconscious; nothing  
is past or forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Freud, ``The Interpretation of Dreams.''  

</P>
<P>
	``The interpretation of dreams is the royal road to a knowledge  
of the unconscious activities of the mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Freud, ``The Interpretation of Dreams.''  

</P>
<P>
	``The great question that has never been answered, and which I  
have not been able to answer, despite my 30 years of research into 
the feminine soul, is, `What does a woman want?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Freud to Marie Bonaparte.  

</P>
<P>
	``Anatomy is destiny.''  
</P>
<P>
	-- Freud, ``Collected Writings.''  

</P>
<P>
	``No neurotic harbors thoughts of suicide which are not  
murderous impulses against others redirected upon himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Freud, ``Beyond the Pleasure Principle.''  

</P>
<P>
	``In popular language we may say that the ego stands for reason  
and sanity, in contrast to the id which stands for untamed 
passions.''

<P>
	-- Freud, ``New Introductory Lectures in Psychoanalysis.''  

</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.''  
</P>
<P>
	-- A comment often attributed to Freud, which biographer Peter  
Gay could find no evidence he said or wrote. 

</P>
<P>
	``For the only therapy is life. The patient must learn to live,  
to live with his split, his conflict, his ambivalence, which no 
therapy can take away ...''

<HEADLINE> Watergate Source Remains Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a city where even the kinkiest details of a  
president's sex life can end up on the front pages, one big secret 
has remained secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Who was ``Deep Throat''?  
</P>
<P>
	For more than a quarter-century, journalists, pundits,  
historians and politicians have tried to divine the identity of the 
Nixon White House insider who kept a pair of resourceful young 
Washington Post reporters steps ahead of the competition on the 
news story of their generation. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation has ranged from Alexander Haig to Diane Sawyer, who  
both deny being perhaps the century's most famous anonymous news 
source. 
</P>
<P>
	Another theory maintains there was no actual ``Deep Throat,''  
that the source was rather a composite, a fictional device created 
by the writers to provide cover for numerous Nixon White House 
leakers and to spice up their best-selling book and blockbuster 
movie, ``All the President's Men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No way, say the reporters, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward.  
``Deep Throat,'' they insist, is a real person whose identity 
they've sworn to keep secret until he dies. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Deep Throat' does exist,'' Bernstein has said. ``He was and  
is one person -- exactly who we have said, a highly placed official 
in the executive branch. ... If we had made up 'Deep Throat,' we 
would have been fired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other names from the Nixon administration on the list of  
possible suspects include: Assistant Attorney General Henry 
Petersen, Deputy White House Counsel Fred Fielding, FBI Director L. 
Patrick Gray, Nixon lawyer Leonard Garment and the late William 
Casey, a government official who later became CIA director. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodward, who continues to write for the Post and is the author  
of ``Shadow,'' a new book that examines the effects of Watergate on 
the men who've occupied the White House since Nixon's resignation 
in 1974, says honoring his promise to ``Deep Throat'' helps him 
convince people he's serious about keeping confidential sources 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	Katharine Graham, the Post's publisher during the Watergate era,  
wrote in her memoirs that her newspaper's top editor, Ben Bradlee, 
assured her of ``Deep Throat's'' reliability. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's why I remain convinced that there was such a person and  
that he ... was neither made up nor an amalgam or a composite of a 
number of people, as has often been hypothesized,'' she wrote.

	Today is Sunday, Aug. 8, the 220th day of 1999. There are 145  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 8, 1974, President Nixon announced he would resign  
following new damaging revelations in the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte set sail for St. Helena to spend the  
remainder of his days in exile. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1876, Thomas A. Edison received a patent for his mimeograph.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, six convicted Nazi saboteurs who'd landed in the United  
States were executed in Washington, D.C.; two others were sentenced 
to life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1945, President Truman signed the United Nations Charter; The  
Soviet Union declared war against Japan during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, the United States and South Korea initialed a mutual  
security pact. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1963, in what became known as Britain's Great Train Robbery,  
thieves made off with 2.6 million pounds in bank notes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, Richard M. Nixon was nominated for president at the  
Republican national convention in Miami Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, Vice President Agnew branded as ``damned lies'' reports  
he had taken kickbacks from government contracts in Maryland and 
vowed not to resign -- which he eventually did. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, the United States launched Pioneer Venus II, which  
carried scientific probes to study the atmosphere of Venus. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: The space shuttle Columbia blasted off from Cape  
Canaveral, Fla., on a secret, five-day military mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: Israel and Jordan opened the first road link  
between the two once-warring countries. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: President Clinton, in his Saturday radio address,  
vowed the bombers of two U.S. embassies in Africa would be brought 
to justice, ``no matter how long it takes or where it takes us.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> `Military Brats' Celebrate Reunion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Gail Gunther Concannon stood in a crowded hotel  
lobby, trading handshakes, hugs and childhood stories. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't matter that she recognized few, if any, of the people.  
</P>
<P>
	Here, she was at home among the estimated 3,000 ``military  
brats'' -- children of military personnel -- attending ``Grand 
Reunion 99,'' the largest such gathering ever held. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all members of a group of people who have no hometowns,  
no roots. We went where our parents went,'' said Mrs. Concannon, 
who lives in Manhattan. ``This is like a little support group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day gathering, which ends Sunday, brought together  
former students from more than 200 military and international 
schools provided for children living abroad with their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4 million children were estimated to have attended such  
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like these people can go see old friends. The places  
they grew up, the bases, either don't exist anymore or it's 
impossible to take such a trip,'' said reunion organizer Joe 
Condrill. 
</P>
<P>
	While the get-together offered typical reunion fare, such as  
dances and dinner, it was also an opportunity to share ``brat 
stories'' about life overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a chemistry that happens when you bring like-minded  
people together,'' said Condrill, founder of Overseas Brats, an 
organization dedicated to reuniting military dependents. ``People 
here are discovering that 80 percent of their backgrounds are the 
same story. They have the same experiences if they went to school 
in Japan or Germany.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a table in the lobby of the Hyatt Regency, Gail Butler  
Newchurch of New Orleans reunited with two friends who graduated 
with her in 1965 from an American high school in Karlsruhe, 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Newchurch, Peter Grammer of El Paso, Texas, and Roger North  
of Dallas flipped through old yearbooks, pointing out former 
teachers and pondering what happened to some of their fellow 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's reconnecting with part of your life that you thought was  
gone and washed away,'' said Mrs. Newchurch, 51. ``When we 
graduated, everybody scattered around the world. It was nearly 
impossible to find people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reunion also offered classes on how to find missing friends  
and panel discussions on the brat experience. On display was 
``Operation Footlocker,'' a traveling museum of brat memorabilia, 
including dog tags, yearbooks, military identification cards and 
school letter jackets. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the former brats got to have their say about the  
American Overseas School Historic Park, scheduled to open in 
Wichita, Kan., in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The $12 million, seven-acre park will contain a museum and  
archive and serve as a gathering point for former brats.

<HEADLINE> Flat Tire Finishes Armstrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) -- Francesco Casagrande of Italy today  
won his second consecutive San Sebastian Classic, a World Cup 
cycling event. 
</P>
<P>
	A flat tire knocked out Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong.  
</P>
<P>
	The American dropped quit about 25 miles from the finish, after  
getting a puncture as he approached the traditionally decisive 
Jaizkibel mountain pass among the leading pack of cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
	The puncture apparently ended Amstrong's hopes of being among  
the leaders at the finish line and he decided to abandoned the race 
rather than change the wheel and carry on. 
</P>
<P>
	And, it was on the Jaizkibel pass that Casagrande opened up his  
lead, crossing the finishing line 43 seconds ahead of the pack of 
25 riders. Rik Verbrougghe of Belgium finished second, followed by 
Italy's Guiliano Figuera. 
</P>
<P>
	Casagrande covered the 143 miles in 5 hours, 15 minutes and 29  
seconds in the sixth of 10 one-day races making up cycling's World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong had said the San Sebastian would be his last race of  
the European season. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's race was the first world class event since the Tour  
de France in July.

<HEADLINE> De Niro Fan Names Eatery After Actor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- For years, restaurateur Salli  
Pateman has worshipped Robert De Niro. She's even named her hip 
Yaletown restaurant DeNiro's Supper Club in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
	A creaky black swivel chair in her office has been specially  
reserved for him in hopes he'll come in for a martini or maybe for 
Sunday brunch to sample the Vito Corleone or the Jake LaMotta or 
the Travis Bickle -- eggs benedict variations named after characters 
De Niro played in Godfather II, Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Now her loyalty is being tested. Pateman says she has received a  
letter from De Niro's lawyer telling her to stop using his name, 
citing a section of the British Columbia Privacy Act. The letter 
threatened legal action against her if she doesn't, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely serious,'' said Pateman, who doesn't want  
to change the name of her restaurant. ``So much for him coming in 
to dine in his sacred chair.''

<HEADLINE> Beer-Barrel Football Tradition Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Less than one year after a fatal  
alcohol-related truck crash involving two Kentucky football 
players, Tennessee and Kentucky have discontinued using a beer 
barrel as the trophy for their football rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky athletic director C.M. Newton said Friday that he and  
Tennessee athletic director Doug Dickey made the decision to stop 
the 74-year-old tradition. Officials would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls Saturday to Tennessee officials were not immediately  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue, white and orange-painted keg has traditionally gone to  
the winner of each year's game. 
</P>
<P>
	But last November, the annual post-game display was canceled out  
of respect for the victims of the crash one week earlier that 
killed Kentucky transfer player Arthur Steinmetz and Eastern 
Kentucky student Scott Brock, the best friend of then-Kentucky star 
quarterback Tim Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests showed that Kentucky football player Jason Watts, the  
driver and sole survivor of the wreck, had a blood-alcohol content 
1 1/2 times the legal limit following the Nov. 15 crash. He pleaded 
guilty to two counts of reckless homicide and was sentenced to 10 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident darkened Kentucky's most successful football season  
in years, climaxing with an appearance in the Jan. 1 Outback Bowl. 
Watts, a senior from Oviedo, Fla., played a key role in the team's 
success, anchoring a line that protected Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts was in jail from March 31 to July 19. Circuit Judge Daniel  
J. Venters released him early and sentenced him to five years 
probation. Watts also is required to attend an alcohol abuse 
program and to do at least 50 hours of community service each year.

<HEADLINE>  Last Solar Eclipse of Century Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAND'S END, England (AP) -- At 11:10 a.m. Wednesday, the small  
island of Bryher in the Scilly Isles off southwestern England will 
go dark as the moon slides across the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first landfall of the millennium's last total  
solar eclipse, an event that is stirring eclipse fever from Europe 
to South Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	From Bryher, the moon's shadow will race at 1,522 mph across the  
southwestern tip of England, where it will be pursued by two 
supersonic Concorde jetliners carrying eclipse revellers, paying 
$2,400 each for the privilege. Then it will speed across northern 
France and swathes of Germany, Austria and Yugoslavia, turning day 
to night in a corridor 69 miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
	It will rush across Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, the Black Sea,  
Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and India, before dying at evening in 
the Bay of Bengal. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters around the world will carry the event live, and  
millions of spectators are expected to gather along the eclipse 
route. Despite inflated prices, many hotels have been booked for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are warning people not to look directly at the sun  
and to avoid traveling during the blackout. Experts say they will 
experience a spectacular rushing wall of darkness, gusting winds 
and an unearthly silence as birds and animals are tricked into 
believing it is night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had fallen. It was extinct. There was no color. The earth  
was dead,'' author Virginia Woolf wrote after watching Britain's 
last total eclipse, on June 29, 1927. 
</P>
<P>
	There will not be much time for marveling. At its longest, over  
south-central Romania, the ``totality'' -- the period when the sun 
is totally obscured -- will last just 2 minutes and 23 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	First recorded in Babylonia in the 21st century B.C., solar  
eclipses were feared by ancient cultures, which believed the sun 
was forsaking the Earth to the demons of the dark. In ancient 
China, astronomers who flubbed eclipse predictions were beheaded. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, an eclipse is an occasion to celebrate.  
</P>
<P>

	A solar eclipse occurs when the moon crosses between the Earth  
and sun, blocking the sun's light. The moon is only one-400th the

dark more than an hour before totality, as the moon ``nibbles'' at 
the sun's rim.

<P>

valleys along the moon's edge look like a celestial necklace, known 
as Baily's beads. This is soon reduced to what looks like a diamond

<P>
	Then the sun is obscured, and its corona -- a radiant halo of  
superheated gas that surrounds the sun -- becomes visible and the

	Scientists also hope to learn more about the gas explosions,  
which cause magnetic storms that can interfere with radio, TV and 
telephone signals on earth and disrupt satellite communications. A 
direct hit in 1989 knocked out power to the Canadian city of

the sun, they also provide a chance to study the earth's 
atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> US Women Win Gold in Softball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The world's best women's softball team  
finally got a challenge. It still got the gold at the Pan American 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Fernandez singled home Dot Richardson in the bottom of the  
eighth inning Saturday night, lifting the United States to a 1-0 
victory over Canada. The Americans, who won the 1996 Olympic gold 
medal with great help from Fernandez and Richardson, went 12-0 in 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But they couldn't shake Canada in the title game after easily  
beating the hosts 5-0 in the afternoon. Although Michele Smith had 
a no-hitter for 6 2-3 innings, the Americans needed an extra inning 
to win it. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a controversial call in the seventh inning left the  
U.S. men's softball team frustrated and angry as they walked off 
the field with a silver medal, losing 4-3 to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	At night, Smith kept Canada off-balance, but the Americans  
couldn't score off pitcher Sandy Newsham. Finally, in the eighth, 
Richardson singled with one out and was sacrificed to second. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez singled off the glove of shortstop Jacki Nichol into  
left field. Running all the way, Richardson slid head-first for the 
championship-clinching run. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men weren't so fortunate.  
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Bobroske hit a bases-loaded infield single off reliever  
Michael White's glove with two outs in the bottom of the seventh to 
give Canada a 4-3 victory and the Pan Am Games championship -- the 
sixth straight time the Canadians have beaten the Americans for the 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans thought they were out of the inning two batters  
earlier when U.S. second baseman Ehren Earleywine fielded Steve 
Price's hopper and threw to first for what appeared to be the final 
out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	But first base umpire Arthur Thompson ruled U.S. first baseman  
Shawn Rychcik pulled his foot and Price was safe. A walk to Douglas 
Chase followed before Bobroske got the game winner to the left of 
the pitcher's mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Replays showed that Rychcik's foot was on the bag, and a couple  
of irate American players were screaming at the umpires as they 
departed the field following the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely thought he was out. It's tough when you give  
Canada four or five outs,'' U.S. manager Dennis Bruckert said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to have that call back and go from there. I think  
both teams know we should have been going another inning. But they 
beat us three times in the tournament. No excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rychcik said his foot was firmly on the bag after taking the  
throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real hard way to lose,'' he said. '' The umpire said I  
came off the base, but I was never on the base until the throw came 
and all I did was drop my foot back. And I drilled the base. I 
could even feel him (Price) come down while I was still on it and 
hit the base. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd rather see a base hit straight off the bat or a home  
run. Lose that way and you always have doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans tied the game in the fourth on a two-run homer by  
Chris DeLarwelle.

<HEADLINE>  Last Solar Eclipse of Century Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAND'S END, England (AP) -- At 11:10 a.m. Wednesday, the small  
island of Bryher in the Scilly Isles off southwestern England will 
go dark as the moon slides across the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first landfall of the millennium's last total  
solar eclipse, an event that is stirring eclipse fever from Europe 
to South Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	From Bryher, the moon's shadow will race at 1,522 mph across the  
southwestern tip of England, where it will be pursued by two 
supersonic Concorde jetliners carrying eclipse revellers, paying 
$2,400 each for the privilege. Then it will speed across northern 
France and swathes of Germany, Austria and Yugoslavia, turning day 
to night in a corridor 69 miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
	It will rush across Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, the Black Sea,  
Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and India, before dying at evening in 
the Bay of Bengal. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters around the world will carry the event live, and  
millions of spectators are expected to gather along the eclipse 
route. Despite inflated prices, many hotels have been booked for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are warning people not to look directly at the sun  
and to avoid traveling during the blackout. Experts say they will 
experience a spectacular rushing wall of darkness, gusting winds 
and an unearthly silence as birds and animals are tricked into 
believing it is night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had fallen. It was extinct. There was no color. The earth  
was dead,'' author Virginia Woolf wrote after watching Britain's 
last total eclipse, on June 29, 1927. 
</P>
<P>
	There will not be much time for marveling. At its longest, over  
south-central Romania, the ``totality'' -- the period when the sun 
is totally obscured -- will last just 2 minutes and 23 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	First recorded in Babylonia in the 21st century B.C., solar  
eclipses were feared by ancient cultures, which believed the sun 
was forsaking the Earth to the demons of the dark. In ancient 
China, astronomers who flubbed eclipse predictions were beheaded. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, an eclipse is an occasion to celebrate.  
</P>
<P>
	In Bucharest, Romania, Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti will  
perform in front of the giant palace built by former communist 
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. The German city of Munich is staging a 
festival of music and food, and Stuttgart plans a rap concert and 
all-night dance party. 
</P>
<P>
	Three big open-air festivals are on tap in southwestern  
England's Cornwall county, which expects up to 1 million visitors. 
The Vienna Symphony Orchestra will perform in the northern Turkish 
city of Amasya, directly on the eclipse trajectory. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, it will be a time to work.  
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are converging on remote sites in India, Iraq and  
Iran to monitor the eclipse, and others will be at the Romanian 
town of Ramnicu Valcea, where the phenomenon will last longest.

Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and NASA's Transition Region and

<HEADLINE> Nursing-Home Neglect Rampant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (AP) -- It wasn't the hard times that  
finally broke Marion Heide. Not the death of her beloved husband, 
or the days of hard work and little money, or the fire that took 
her home. 
</P>
<P>
	She survived all that and lived to a ripe old age.  
</P>
<P>
	But her life ended at 88, with Marion bruised and bleeding,  
curled into a ball in a nursing home bed, so scared of the nurses 
who were supposed to help her that she cried when they came near. 
</P>
<P>
	Her decline began with a scraped leg. Without the care she  
needed, the scrape turned into a sore. The skin around it turned 
black, and infection sank to the bone. Finally, doctors cut off her 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion died three months later.  
</P>
<P>
	Jurors understood that she was near the end of her life, sick  
with diabetes and a bad heart. That didn't excuse her final 11 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	They slapped the nursing home's owner and its operator -- a  
corporation that runs more than 100 nursing homes across the 
Southeast -- with a negligence verdict and $6.5 million in 
compensatory damages. When the jurors said they wanted to consider 
punitive damages, too, the defendants' lawyers settled for an even 
$10 million and ended the case there. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite federal and state laws, hundreds of inspectors across  
the country and years of newspaper and TV horror stories, neglect 
and abuse of the elderly remain cruel realities. 
</P>
<P>
	One nursing home in four has severe deficiencies that endanger  
people's health or their lives, according to a recent federal 
study. Advocates for reform say that figure is low, and they note 
that the aging of the baby boom generation promises to exacerbate 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Why is it so difficult to solve these nagging problems, to stop  
these tragedies? The answer is complicated, but part of it may be 
found in Marion Heide's story. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	She could be bullheaded, Marion could.  
</P>
<P>
	She wouldn't change the channel on her TV set. She liked only  
ABC, especially ``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of Fortune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She liked her beer, but not cold. Let it sit until it got to  
room temperature, she'd say. 
</P>
<P>
	A stout woman with frizzy hair and sensible dresses, she spent  
two decades working at a Salvation Army store after her second 
husband, George Heide, a cabdriver, died of a heart attack. She 
wouldn't leave the little house on Marion Street in Brooklyn where 
they lived. 
</P>
<P>
	She was going to die in that house, she'd say.  
</P>
<P>
	In her 70s, her eyesight failing, she ended up a widow alone  
with a worn, hand-painted portrait of George beside her bed. Few 
relatives came to visit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Halloween 1993, a fire burned her out. Grandson Brian  
Schroeder took Marion to his home on Long Island and got her an 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion had been unwilling, yet suddenly she had family again --  
dinners, great-grandchildren, birthday parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``You saved my life,'' she wrote to Brian and his wife that  
year, her script slow and careful but the words tumbling together. 
``I know I'm a hindrance to you I will try to do everything you 
both think I should do I thought I was going to end my life... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I love my home,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	When Schroeder decided to move to Florida a year later, stubborn  
Marion didn't want to go. He packed the car, told her he was taking 
her to the store and headed south. She figured it out by the time 
they were crossing into New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, another grandchild, Barbara Meley, took Marion into  
her home in New Port Richey. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion adjusted. She liked to sit by a slow-moving creek behind  
Mrs. Meley's house where trees hang over the water. She liked to 
hold Stormy, a little poodle. She'd talk about George, her home 
that burned, Brooklyn. ``I want to go back,'' she'd say. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the ailments came. She had a mini-stroke and began to fall.  
Some nights she couldn't make it out of bed to get to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	At 87, she fell and cut her head against a glass table.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Meley, who worked during the day, realized she could no  
longer care for Marion. ``I was afraid leaving her at home all 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Americans 65 and older number 34 million, and that figure is  
expected to reach 90 million in 40 years. Nearly half of those over 
65 will spend at least a little time in a nursing home, and one in 
four will spend one year or more in one, demographers predict. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, about 1.5 million people, largely the World War II  
generation, live in nursing homes. That could grow to 5 million by 
2040. 
</P>
<P>
	It is big business. There are some 17,000 nursing homes, and  
large corporations dominate the industry. Nursing-home care cost 
$78 billion in 1996, with more than half paid by the federal and 
state Medicaid and Medicare systems. 
</P>
<P>
	There are many choices for the elderly who remain independent:  
assisted living facilities, adult day care, home health care. But 
for the frailest, those who are bedridden or need constant 
supervision, the nursing home can be the only option. 
</P>
<P>
	The modern nursing home industry was born in the mid-1960s with  
Medicaid and Medicare. What followed was a cycle of abuse and 
reform, repeated over three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s there were widespread reports of fraud and abuse,  
including a scathing study from Ralph Nader. Government hearings 
brought new regulations. The cycle returned in the 1980s. A 1986 
law strengthened protection, but problems remain. 
</P>
<P>
	A stream of complaints of neglect and abuse has prompted a U.S.  
Senate committee to order investigations and begin hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering the vast amount of money that Congress pays on  
Medicare and Medicaid,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, an Iowa 
Republican who is the panel's chairman, ``we haven't done an 
adequate job of oversight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Hill Nursing Home won superior ratings from Florida's  
inspectors for several years running. The low building has a 
welcoming lawn, cheerful plants out front and chairs for residents 
and guests to sit in the sun. Schoolchildren visit. It was clean 
and bright when Barbara Meley toured the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Heide arrived at Heather Hill after three months at an  
assisted living facility. She'd grown to like it there but fell and 
broke her hip. After surgery, she needed rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems began almost immediately: Marion was so sleepy she  
couldn't keep her head up. Mrs. Meley questioned nurses about the 
medication, and soon Marion was again alert and able to eat with 
the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Meley had other complaints: The food was often cold; she  
found her grandmother naked in her bed; and sometimes Marion had 
soiled herself and no one had cleaned her. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was more, according to nursing home documents  
presented at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Meley's lawyers argued that the nursing home operator --  
National Healthcare Corp. -- knowingly left the home understaffed on 
nights and weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	Aide after aide testified about the workload, how they were told  
when they began working that they would care for 15 residents but 
that often became 20 or 30, occasionally 60. Residents would go 
without spoon-feeding or a bath. They would not get turned in bed, 
the surest way to prevent bed sores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always worked short, shorthanded, you know, not enough help,  
and I couldn't give my patients the care that they deserved,'' 
Marcia Wakefield, a former nurse's aide at the home, testified at 
the March trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The home ignored repeated complaints from workers that they were  
overloaded, aides testified. A former administrator at an NHC-run 
home testified that superiors repeatedly refused her requests for 
more staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months after Marion entered Heather Hill, a nurse recorded  
a ``small abrasion'' on her shin. Though bedsores are a significant 
danger for the bedridden and elderly, nobody contacted a doctor for 
six weeks, according to the home's records. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, the shin was badly infected. Nursing home documents  
show sporadic treatment. Over 5 months, the sore grew 20 times in 
size, eating into Marion's body until her ankle bones 
disintegrated. 
</P>
<P>
	The records also showed that months went by with no indication  
that she got medicine prescribed for her depression, and that she 
received only half her doses of narcotic pain medication, despite 
screams of pain. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 3, Marion's right leg was amputated at the hospital.  
She died on July 17, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In court, lawyers for operator NHC and owner York Hannover  
Nursing Centers argued that Marion's poor health, including a 
circulatory disorder, prevented her leg from healing. She refused 
to eat and drink, they said. Their lawyers argued that care was 
provided even if it was not documented. That was an argument jurors 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was gross negligence,'' said juror William Tingley.  
``It's a pity we have our senior citizens taken care of this way at 
nursing homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This woman came into the nursing home and she was walking, she  
was talking, she was mentally OK except for she didn't want to go 
in,'' said a juror who spoke about the verdict on condition her 
name not be used. ``And when she left, she was screaming, and 
saying she wanted to die, in a state of severe depression and in 
severe pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, an 80-year-old man starved to death in a nursing home,  
and a jury last year awarded $250 million to his family. In 
California, a worker dropped a nursing-home patient and broke her 
hip, and jurors awarded $94 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers say the growing number of lawsuits and the high damage  
awards reflect a frustration with lax government oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Wilkes, whose firm handled Mrs. Meley's case, said suits hit  
the corporations where they understand, the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll break them eventually if they do it enough. And we'll get  
justice,'' Wilkes said. 
</P>
<P>
	But even when government oversight is in place, it does not  
necessarily stop problems. Two recent studies by the General 
Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, found: 
</P>
<P>
	--Even after sanctions, 40 percent of homes with the most severe  
deficiencies were in violation again three years later. 
</P>
<P>
	--The most prevalent of the serious problems are bedsores,  
letting people go hungry, failing to care for the incontinent. 
Advocates say all are the outcome of simple neglect, not physical 
beatings or sexual assaults that draw headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pressure sores are the biggest of the serious problems  
nationwide, with 2,809 homes cited from January 1997 to October 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators are studying whether the government  
should, for the first time, mandate specific per-patient staffing 
ratios of nurses and aides. Research by several academics and 
consumer advocates has concluded that staffing levels are often too 
low to let nurses and aides do their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is considering establishing a national criminal  
background check for every nursing home employee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are failing our parents and we must do more,'' President  
Clinton said last summer, ordering random inspections so nursing 
homes can't hide their problems and faster punishment for repeat 
serious violators. 
</P>
<P>
	The nursing home industry agrees abusive homes should be  
punished. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the worst homes cut back staff for profits, and they should  
and will be caught by the state and federal oversight system, said 
Tom Burke, a spokesman for the American Health Care Association, 
which represents 11,000 care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even the best homes struggle with a tight labor market  
and staffing needs that change according to the health of 
residents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Heather Hill acknowledged there were times when the  
home was not fully staffed but denied that was corporate policy. 
Officials with NHC did not return repeated phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the industry say extra regulatory paperwork takes time  
away from residents, and closing down homes simply limits options 
for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need the state, I don't need the ombudsman, I don't  
need a reporter, and I don't need an attorney to tell me to do a 
good job,'' said Roy Meredith, the administrator of another NHC-run 
home in Clearwater, Fla. The home has had 10 years of superior 
state ratings for being clean of violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the so-called neglect is just aides failing to write  
down the care they provide, he said. Sympathetic jurors respond to 
the horror stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a person falls, fractures their hip -- which is what old  
people do -- we lose,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	The house at 338A Marion St. is gone. An apartment building  
stands in its place now. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen blocks away is a cemetery, lush and green with oak trees  
and quiet, except for the passing hum of a tractor-trailer on the 
Interborough Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
	There are purple cloth flowers, faded in the sun, next to the  
granite tombstone bearing the inscription: George Heide, 1898-1964. 
Marion's name is not here, but this is her resting place. 
</P>
<P>
	``She'd always say, 'I want to be with Grandpa,''' Mrs. Meley  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And so Mrs. Meley drove from Florida to New York, dug a hole  
next to the grave for Marion's ashes, and returned her grandmother 
to her beloved Brooklyn.

<HEADLINE> Crews Clean After Ala. Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PELHAM, Ala. (AP) -- While a victim of the latest workplace  
violence was buried Saturday, cleanup continued at one of the 
companies where a gunman killed three people. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson Enterprises, where two of the victims were shot, plans  
to reopen Monday. Only cleaning crews and investigators were 
allowed in on Friday. Post Airgas, site of the third killing, also 
was closed Friday. Some employees placed a white wreath on the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Eugene Miller, 34, of Billingsley, is charged with capital  
murder in the shootings that took place Thursday, and is being held 
without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services for Terry Jarvis, 39, a Post Airgas employee,  
were held Saturday. The other two funerals were to take place 
Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson officials said Miller was employed there at the time of  
the shootings. Miller's mother said he had been laid off from Post 
Airgas in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Though a motive has yet to be determined, authorities said the  
victims apparently were chosen deliberately. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings in the Birmingham suburb of Pelham took place one  
week and about 145 miles from an Atlanta office massacre in which 
nine were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a safe little city south of Birmingham,'' Pelham  
Mayor Bobby Hayes said Friday. ``But what's a safe area anymore?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was arrested by officers who spotted him driving on  
Interstate 65. He struck a deputy before being subdued, said Pelham 
Police Chief Alan Wade. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Johnson, one of Miller's court-appointed attorneys, said  
defense lawyers haven't decided on a plea, but said it would be 
something along the lines of innocent by reason of mental disease 
or defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said Miller ``knows he's in jail, but I don't think he  
understands the significance of it all.''

<HEADLINE> Freud Changed Way We Look at Things </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One hundred years ago, a 43-year-old Viennese  
neurologist produced a book with an intriguing claim: that dreams 
express our hidden desires. Despite its vivid prose and frank talk 
about sex, almost no one read it. Six years after publication, 
``The Interpretation of Dreams'' had sold only 351 copies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the author, Sigmund Freud, started a conversation, and we  
haven't stopped talking since. 
</P>
<P>
	``Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a  
lifetime,'' Freud himself observed later. 
</P>
<P>
	After a century of Freud, you can blame him or thank him, laugh  
or lie down, but a couch may never again be just a couch. Never 
again will we look at ourselves and each other in quite the same 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	He took us inward. He gave us the talking cure, a technique he  
called ``psychoanalysis'' that uses free association, dream 
interpretation and the patient's response to the analyst to explore 
the mind. A father of three boys and three girls, Freud plumbed the 
child's-eye view to find the core of the adult. If our dreams 
tumble with secrets exposed, he said, awake we're driven by 
conflicts deep in the unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing is accidental. Everything has meaning. Freedom comes  
when we know how we were shaped by the past -- that's the goal of 
psychoanalysis. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been doubters from the start -- the most basic  
criticism that there's simply no proof that Freud's methods work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if people get better, that doesn't mean they get better  
because of the treatment,'' said Adolf Grunbaum, a leading Freud 
skeptic who is a philosopher of science and a research professor of 
psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. Grunbaum respects 
Freud's genius but says he generalized too much and claimed credit 
as originator of ideas from antiquity. 
</P>
<P>
	Original or not, Freud's work swept away old views of how the  
mind works and brought new insights into mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Freud's time, the mentally ill were lucky if they didn't  
get locked away in an asylum, where shackles and beatings were 
common, said his biographer, historian Peter Gay, who runs the 
Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
	An alternative, usually available only to the wealthy, was  
sometimes called moral treatment or moral therapy. This was found 
in country retreats that offered mainly rest, exercise, nourishing 
food and a lot of talking. ``Above all, being gentle with them,'' 
Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people were just neglected or just let go. These are  
the crazy eccentrics you read about in Dickens,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And after Freud?  
</P>
<P>
	Just listen. Everyday talk bubbles with words from the  
psychological lexicon: psyche out, obsessive, compulsive, 
repressed, oedipal, well-adjusted, manic. 
</P>
<P>
	We're urged to talk about our feelings. We fantasize. We  
project. We're in denial. We internalize. We grow paranoid with 
anxiety. We're on guard against subliminal messages in advertising. 
We suppress urges when our inner child threatens to get us in 
trouble by acting out. 
</P>
<P>
	A newsletter for investors advises those suddenly enriched by a  
windfall: ``Maintaining our former sense of self might be difficult 
and important relationships are likely to change. ... if you decide 
not to work, will you be able to feel good about yourself?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flocks of counselors offer psychological rescue for whole towns  
after traumas such as school shootings and deadly weather. Project 
Heartland, funded by government to provide counseling after the 
1995 Oklahoma City bombing, offered the same service when tornadoes 
ripped through the Midwest this year. Tipper Gore, the vice 
president's wife, led a recent White House conference to dispel 
myths about people who suffer from mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not all serious.  
</P>
<P>
	The ``Peanuts'' comic strip character Lucy dispenses psychiatric  
help at 5 cents a pop. Robert DeNiro plays a mobster with 
trigger-anxiety and Billy Crystal plays his therapist in the comedy 
movie ``Analyze This.'' But then, show business has always loved 
Freud. Check out ``Lady in the Dark,'' a Broadway musical turned 
into a 1944 movie starring Ginger Rogers as a magazine editor who 
undergoes analysis to decide among three beaux, with music by Kurt 
Weill and Ira Gershwin. 
</P>
<P>
	There was even a 1962 Hollywood biography, ``Freud,'' with  
Montgomery Clift in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
	Sigmund Freud was born May 6, 1856, in what is now the Czech  
Republic, and lived in Vienna most of his life. His home is a 
museum and he's a revered national figure in Austria. He died Sept. 
23, 1939, in London, a refugee from the Nazis, who burned the books 
of the atheist Jew. An 83-year-old man with cancer of the jaw, he 
asked for a fatal dose of morphine. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1800s, his research into neurology had drawn him to  
study hysteria -- strange symptoms of distress, like paralyzed limbs 
with no physical cause. This led him toward the mind. The Victorian 
period was waning, sex was back in vogue. Then World War I put a 
focus on aggression. Freud concluded the two drives were basic. 
</P>
<P>
	A writer of clear and powerful prose, Freud reached  
practitioners and public alike. He organized a movement to spread 
his theories. 
</P>
<P>
	Timing, good writing and promotion. ``Those three coalesced,''  
said Michael Roth, curator of the Library of Congress exhibit 
``Sigmund Freud: Conflict and Culture'' now at the Jewish Museum in 
New York and headed to Vienna and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Freud applied his theories to other fields. He analyzed society  
and history, religion and art, morality and politics. 
</P>
<P>
	By midcentury, his influence and stature were clear -- placing  
him, according to one scholar's choice published in 1949, third 
among the 10 ``greats of our time,'' after Mohandas Gandhi and 
Albert Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
	The '50s and '60s were Freud's heyday in America.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was the only show in town,'' said Rosemarie Sand, a retired  
psychoanalyst in White Plains, N.Y. ``It was the answer to 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1970s, Freudian psychoanalysis, a process that may  
involve several sessions each week and take years, has been 
eclipsed in popularity by other forms of less costly and intensive 
psychotherapy and by drugs. Employers and health insurers no longer 
want to pay for unlimited therapy and many people lack the time or 
inclination. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguments over Freud continue to rage. Witness the controversy  
over the Library of Congress show, which opened last year in 
Washington after a two-year delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers blamed a lack of funding, but concern that it would  
be worshipful and one-sided prompted historian Peter Swales to 
circulate a petition in which 50 scholars and critics urged that 
the exhibit ``adequately reflect the full spectrum of informed 
opinion about the status of Freud's contribution to intellectual 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curator Roth, associate director of the Getty Research Institute  
for the History of Art and the Humanities in Los Angeles, said he 
had intended to consult Freud's critics before the petition, but 
the controversy made him more sensitive to it. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, emblazoned above the displays of letters and  
diaries and drafts in Freud's fluid, uphill script, are statements 
like feminist Germaine Greer's acid observation in 1970: ``Freud is 
the father of psychoanalysis. It had no mother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Swales questioned the entire discipline that  
Freud fathered. ``What are the benefits of 100 years of 
psychoanalysis?'' he said, speaking from his home in New York. The 
field that probes the mind is subject to fads, he said, noting 
current enthusiasm for drugs like Prozac, the world's best-selling 
antidepressant. ``The field of psychiatry is overpopulated with 
fashion victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, feminists were among those who brought Freud down  
from his pedestal, ridiculing ideas such as his theory that women 
are destined to be unhappy because they lack the physical apparatus 
of males. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women are quite right about Freud,'' said Mrs. Sand.  
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to a female friend Freud famously asked, ``What does  
a woman want?'' What a woman wants, said Mrs. Sand, is equal rights 
and fair treatment. ``Nowadays, your typical analyst, he's not 
going to hit her with penis envy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Decades earlier, Karen Horney, a prominent German-American  
psychiatrist, called Freud's theories on femininity male fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
	Freud ``did make a great contribution because he was the first  
one to talk about the sexuality of women,'' said Ruth Lax, an 
author, psychologist and analyst who teaches at Cornell Medical 
School. ``He didn't fully understand it, but he acknowledged it. 
That was a great step forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Freud's work was not about women, however, but about  
people in general. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout his life he revisited his theories, discarding,  
changing and trying out new ones. Like the patients he treated -- 
like the patients who today seek help from psychotherapists and 
analysts -- Freud was shaped by who he was, when and where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
	As his granddaughter Sophie Freud, a psychologist, has said of  
his theories: ``They should never be cast in cement; only religion 
does that. His work is a mixture of amazing leaps into the future, 
with other parts embedded in his own time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His ideas have provided a bedrock from which more modern theory  
has evolved, even though many were only grasped on a ``superficial 
... cocktail-party level,'' Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freud offered explanations for the everyday mysteries. For  
example, sibling rivalry. ``Everybody has known brothers and 
sisters don't always get along,'' Gay said. ``But he gives you ways 
of understanding how this might come about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Gay, ``Maybe one of the most important things he talks  
about is that people love and hate each other at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freud visited the United States just once. In September 1909 he  
spent a week at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., lecturing on 
psychoanalysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet it was this country that gave Freud's ideas their warmest  
embrace. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? Perhaps it's American insecurity, identity issues in a  
nation of immigrants, people always reinventing themselves; or, in 
a culture that exalts the striver, another way to seek personal and 
interpersonal perfection. 
</P>
<P>
	Freud, if he were alive today, might not recognize his legacy,  
much less approve. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet a direct lineage can be traced from the neurotic Europeans  
on Freud's couch -- really more of a chaise lounge draped with an 
oriental rug -- to today's walking wounded of America talking 
upright to psychotherapists about anything from childhood abuse to 
marriage troubles and alcoholism to neurotic pets. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, it's normal in much of the world to seek professional  
help for what ails the mind. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, psychologist Rika Kayama writes a magazine advice  
column and appears on TV variety and quiz shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In Scotland, two policewomen sent to the 1996 school massacre in  
the town of Dunblane, where 16 children and a teacher died, are 
suing their employers, claiming they didn't get enough counseling 
for stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people in India can afford psychotherapy, but they can call  
and seek advice from Dr. Broota, a popular voice on New Delhi 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia, where Freud's works were once banned and dissidents  
were tossed into psychiatric wards as punishment, people now clamor 
for therapy to cure stress, sex problems, alcoholism, drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, the Chinese used to denounce psychology as bourgeois  
and told the insane to improve their thinking by reading Mao 
Tse-tung. These days they worry about a therapist shortage. Many 
cities now offer counseling hotlines; Shanghai has at least nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Buenos Aires claims the world's highest per capita supply of  
psychoanalysts, many clustered in one part of town. It's called 
``Villa Freud.''

<HEADLINE> No Trace of Escaped Killer Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NOTTINGHAM, Pa. (AP) -- Police found no trace today of an escaped  
quadruple murderer in their search of a wooded park near the 
Maryland border, and said the suspect likely left the area in a 
stolen car. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Johnston, who escaped from a Pennsylvania prison earlier  
in the week, is considered ``armed and extremely dangerous,'' state 
police Lt. David M. Presto said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said it was likely that he has left the Nottingham  
area in a silver Buick that was stolen Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Local residents described a cautious and curious mood.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some people are locking their door,'' resident Jim Murray said  
this morning as he stopped outside a convenience store. ``There's a 
lot of curiosity because this is a town that doesn't get a lot of 
attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, 48, was spotted talking on a pay phone Friday night  
but escaped into the 600-acre Nottingham County Park after a 
scuffle with one of the rangers, said state police Capt. Henry 
Oleyniczak. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston was convicted in 1980 of killing four teen-agers to  
cover up a multimillion-dollar burglary ring he ran with his two 
brothers. The film ``At Close Range,'' starring Sean Penn, was 
based on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	He escaped Monday from a prison where he was serving a life  
sentence. Police said he opened the window in his cell, sneaked 
across a grassy yard and wriggled through a fence at the 
maximum-security complex.

<HEADLINE> Neo Nazis Cancel Rally to Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A neo-Nazi group abruptly canceled its planned  
rally Saturday in the nation's capital even though the city closed 
a number of streets and spent an estimated $1 million on police to 
protect them, Metropolitan Police Chief Charles Ramsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four members of the Knights of Freedom Nationalist Party showed  
up to take part in the march in support of an Aryan homeland, 
Ramsey said. They told police who were to escort them to the 
beginning of the parade route that they would not march, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The march was canceled because of huge counter demonstrations  
were planned and ``the media worked this thing up into a frenzy,'' 
said Jeff Krause, executive vice president of the group that has 
recently started calling itself the American Nationalist Party. 
``We did not want any of our people hurt,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group had a permit -- obtained under the name Knights of  
Freedom Nationalist Party -- that would have allowed up to 300 
supporters to march six blocks along Pennsylvania Avenue and hold a 
rally in Lafayette Square -- the tiny park across the street from 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department said Ramsey  
will ask the district's legal staff to sue the American Nationalist 
Party, a name recently taken by the small group formerly known the 
Knights of Freedom, to recover the costs incurred for providing 
security for the march and several counter protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the media is to blame, Krause said, a suit against the  
party would be unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	City police and the United States Park Police deployed nearly  
2,000 police officers in riot gear in the downtown area to deal 
with potential problems that never materialized. ``There also is an 
expectation that if you are going to do this sort of thing that you 
follow through,'' Ramsey said noting that personnel and equipment 
costs could exceed $1 million. ``The taxpayers ought to be 
reimbursed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had worked on plans for controlling the neo-Nazi  
demonstration and several counter protests for more than six weeks. 
Portions of more than a dozen city blocks were closed for much of 
Saturday afternoon. ``Our plan of action included street closures 
for the safety of the public,'' said Sgt. Robert McClean, a 
spokesman for the U.S. Park Police, which has jurisdiction in the 
vicinity of the White House. The area of blocked off to general 
public access was similar to the security perimeter put in place 
for the NATO meeting earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also used steel barricades to divide Lafayette Park into  
two fenced perimeters where opposing demonstrators could express 
their views had Saturday's demonstrations gone off as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shut them down cold today, and that's exactly what we set  
out to do, '' said Rami Elamine, an organizer of D.C. United to 
Stop the Nazi's. The ad hoc coalition of community groups marched 
six blocks to Lafayette Square and held a noisy anti-Nazi rally 
that became a victory celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand how all this ignorance festers,'' said Josh  
Trapp of Jackson, Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	At another counter-rally at the Lincoln Memorial, Mayor Anthony  
Williams called the planned neo-Nazi march a ``chilling reminder'' 
that at the start of the new millennium people still want to spread 
hate. 
</P>
<P>
	There are still people who think their ``skin color gives them a  
mandate'' to exclude others, Williams said. ``We must speak up and 
we must speak out against hate now and always,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton blasted the neo-Nazis as ``the  
ugliest part of America.''

<HEADLINE> Pilots' Union Approve Reno Air Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Leaders of the union representing  
American Airlines pilots have voted to approve a proposal that they 
say could end the stalemate with management over the acquisition of 
Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich LaVoy, president of the Allied Pilots Association, said  
Friday he would not reveal specifics of the proposal until American 
management has an opportunity to review it and respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's offer to pilots had fallen short of some  
long-standing union demands and led to a February sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	The sickout was blamed for the cancellation of more than 6,700  
flights, and the union was fined $45.5 million for ignoring court 
orders to tell pilots to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake was how American will absorb about 300 pilots from Reno  
Air, which American's parent, AMR Corp., bought in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9,500-member pilots' union said American was undercutting  
its members' pay by using the Reno Air pilots and paying them 
substantially less than American pilots.

<HEADLINE> Some New Nursing Home Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Efforts to improve the nation's nursing homes include orders  
from President Clinton, suggestions from federal auditors and 
legislation in Congress: 

</P>
<P>
	On Clinton's order, the Department of Health and Human Services  
now: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Levies immediate fines of up to $10,000 for problem nursing  
homes, instead of giving them time to correct problems before 
facing penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Requires state inspection agencies to respond more quickly --  
within 10 days -- to complaints alleging harm to residents. 

</P>
<P>
	New requirements proposed after the General Accounting Office,  
Congress' investigative arm, found evidence in two studies that at 
least one out of four homes provided such poor care that residents 
were harmed: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Inspections of nursing homes on nights and weekends so  
surveyors get a more complete picture of the care provided. 
</P>
<P>
	-- More thorough review of a home's efforts to fix problems.  

</P>
<P>
	In Congress, lawmakers are still considering legislation that  
would create a national criminal background check for the nursing 
home industry to ensure that abusive aides and nurses previously 
convicted of violent crimes are not rehired. 

</P>
<P>
	Under review are changes that would:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Target nursing home chains with a poor record of meeting state  
standards, so that they will be inspected more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cut off inspection funds to states that continually have a  
poor record of citing nursing homes for substandard care. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Collect information on patient care in a national automated  
data system, so that federal and state officials can identify 
problem facilities earlier.

<HEADLINE> State Sen. Wife in Nude Photo Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The wife of a top state lawmaker has quit her  
job with the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission after technicians 
found nude photos of her that had been shot in the turnpike 
headquarters, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnpike Executive Director John Durbin had suspended Deborah  
Eckert Jubelirer, 43, after officials learned that a nude photo of 
her was in the commission computer system, the paper reported. She 
resigned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband is Senate President Pro Tem Robert Jubelirer. He had  
no comment, said an aide, David Atkinson. Aides said Jubelirer knew 
nothing of the situation and that he and his wife have separated. 
</P>
<P>
	A commission technician, Kenneth R. Manherz, was accused of  
shooting the photos with a digital camera that belonged to the 
commission, the newspaper said. He was fired Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one other female employee at the turnpike building in  
Highspire appeared in the photos, but no action was taken because 
her role was minor, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jubelirer, who earned $65,539 a year, could not be located  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnpike officials refused to discuss personnel issues.  
</P>
<P>
	``We consider the case closed,'' said Bill Capone, deputy  
executive director in charge of the marketing department.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Battle Nevada Wildfires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Rain and cooler weather helped conquer one big  
fire in western Nevada but 3,000 firefighters continued battling 
more than 100 brush fires that have burned an area nearly the size 
of Rhode Island and were threatening some homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, all across the northern part of the state is  
fires,'' JoLynn Worley, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Land 
Management, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	At 611,000 acres and growing, the fires threatened ranches and  
homes near the Oregon border, and smoke intermittently forced the 
closure of Interstate 80 on Friday near Lovelock, Winnemucca, 
Battle Mountain and Elko. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, firefighters said Friday night they had fully  
contained one of the worst blazes, Idaho's Mule Butte fire that had 
burned more than 92,500 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a fire in eastern Idaho was sparked by lightning  
Friday afternoon and burned about 4,000 acres before it was 
contained. 
</P>
<P>
	In northeast Nevada's Elko County, a fast-moving brush fire  
burned two unoccupied mobile homes and forced the evacuation of at 
least 20 people in Spring Creek. Flames came within a few feet of 
some homes in that densely populated subdivision 12 miles southeast 
of Elko along the Ruby Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Fires also burned within a mile of a housing subdivision in  
Battle Mountain. But only three outbuildings had been destroyed, 
with no homes damaged or injuries reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the fires were sparked by more than 8,000 lightning  
strikes as thunderstorms rolled across the state. They were burning 
sage brush and cheat grass across remote, uninhabited range, 
forcing hand crews to hike for long distances. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty steep. We ran into rattlesnakes. It was pretty  
tough conditions,'' firefighter Stan Henrich said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 firefighters were focusing their attention on the  
Skyline housing subdivision near Battle Mountain, where a series of 
fires has burned more than 70,000 acres about 200 miles east of 
Reno.

<HEADLINE> Uneasiness Seen on Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The wave of worry that washed over Wall Street  
this past week had one primary source: fears of higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But for weeks now, markets have also been rattled by a pesky  
undercurrent of currency woes. The U.S. dollar has been in a slide 
against the Japanese yen and the euro as global economies improve, 
suggesting to investors around the world that the United States is 
far from the only place to put their money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The relative weakness of the dollar has surprised people,''  
said Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at Dain Rauscher 
Wessels in Minneapolis. ``It's a wild card that has definitely had 
an impact on Wall Street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday afternoon, a dollar bought 114.15 yen, up slightly  
from a six-month low of 113.65 reached Thursday. As recently as May 
20, a dollar was worth 124.82 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has also fallen against the euro, the European common  
currency that sank after its debut in January. The dollar hit a 
three-month low of $1.0824 against the euro on Thursday before 
recovering to $1.0734 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has been pulled down by a number of factors,  
including jitters about higher interest rates, uncertainty about 
economic policy and a burgeoning recovery of Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The story that's emerging is that there are signs of growth  
outside the U.S.,'' said Allison Montgomery, currency economist 
with IDEAGlobal.com in New York. ``Capital is shifting to different 
parts of the world for the first time in quite a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the second quarter, international mutual funds had a positive  
inflow of cash for the first time in more than a year, according to 
the Investment Company Institute. Japan isn't the only attraction; 
Russian, European and Brazilian investments are all on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent weakness in U.S. stocks has multiple roots, and even  
if the dollar regains some of its strength, that won't necessarily 
bolster the stock market. That's because currencies and stock 
markets don't always move in step, said Marc Chandler, chief 
currency strategist at Mellon Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market is anchored to the business cycle,'' he said.  
``Currency is not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, a strong dollar could fortify the broader economy,  
warding off market menaces like inflation. A strong dollar makes 
imports cheaper, so while U.S. consumers have spent heavily on 
foreign-made goods like sports cars and CD players, they've been 
able to do so without touching off inflation. Heavy U.S. demand 
helped Asia climb out of its financial crisis of 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's the catch: All those foreign goods have created a massive  
trade deficit with the rest of the world. The big trade gap doesn't 
trouble economists as long as foreign investors bought into U.S. 
stocks and bonds. But once foreign economies start to improve, 
overseas investors begin keeping their money at home. They buy 
fewer U.S. stocks, and they don't need to buy dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll be even more likely to give up their U.S. investments if  
the Federal Reserve raises interest rates for a second time, as 
many analysts expect. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed's decision has the potential to disrupt the fragile  
balance in the global economy,'' said Kathy Jones, director of 
futures research at Prudential Securities. Higher interest rates 
make stocks less appealing as escalating borrowing costs cut into 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for the dollar's decline is the reluctance of  
U.S. officials to take steps to push it higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's strength in recent years was reinforced by former  
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who made a strong dollar a 
cornerstone of his economic policy. Rubin stepped down in May, and 
while his successor, Lawrence Summers, has maintained his interest 
in a strong U.S. currency, he has not yet been willing to intervene 
in the currency market. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers has balanced his policy efforts with Japan's strong  
desire to prevent the yen from rising too far, too fast. Japan has 
already spent $30 billion to buy dollars, hoping to raise their 
value and hold down the rising yen. A stronger yen would make 
Japanese goods more expensive overseas, which could crush the 
recovery before it truly takes off. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler believes that the dollar remains safe and stable,  
pointing out that the U.S. currency is extremely strong compared to 
that of some key trading partners -- the Canadian dollar, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plenty of people think this is just a long overdue  
correction,'' he said. ``I think the dollar is strong and I think 
the stock market is strong. You can have both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average was the only  
major market indicator to end higher, rising 58.88 points. The Dow 
lost 79.79 points Friday, closing at 10,714.03. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq ended the week with a loss of 90.52 points, slipping  
17.86 on Friday to close at 2,547.97. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index lost 28.43 for the week,  
dropping 13.42 Friday to close at 1,300.29. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange composite was down 15.03 for the  
week, losing 6.35 Friday to close at 611.04. The American Stock 
Exchange composite lost 10.31 on the week and closed at 777.92, 
rising 1.83 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, which reflects the performance of  
small-company stocks, plunged 16.73 for the week to 428.04, after 
falling 1.71 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- which represents the  
combined market value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- 
ended the week at $11.84 trillion, off $326.96 billion from last 
week. A year ago the index was $10.17 trillion.

<HEADLINE>  Self Possessed Wins $1M Hambletonian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Self Possessed recorded the fastest  
trotting mile in winning the Hambletonian on Saturday, giving 
driver Mike Lachance and trainer Ron Gurfein their third victory 
since 1994 in trotting's biggest race. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed came into the $1 million race at the Meadowlands  
Racetrack as the prohibitive favorite, and the 3-year-old son of 
Victory Dream didn't disappoint, covering the mile 1:51.3. 
</P>
<P>
	The time broke the trotting world record of 1:51.4 set by Beat  
The Wheel, a 4-year-old mare, in 1994 at the Meadowlands. It also 
shattered the Hambletonian stakes record of 1:52.1 set in a 1996 
elimination by another Gurfein-Lachance winner, Continentalvictory. 
She came back in the final to win in 1:52.2, the fastest time in a 
Hambo final. 
</P>
<P>
	Gurfein and Lachance's first win came with Victory Dream.  
</P>
<P>
	Angus Hall, driven by five-time Hambletonian winner John  
Campbell, finished a distant second, 5 1/2 lengths behind. Enjoy Lavec 
was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed paid $2.80, $2.40 and $2.10 as part of a  
three-horse entry that included Angus Hall and Raffaello Ambrosio. 
Enjoy Lavec, whose trainer Jimmy Takter is appealing a one-year 
suspension for having an illegal substance in a detention barn, was 
$2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed, who had the fastest time in last weekend's  
eliminations, broke from the No. 4 post position in the field of 10 
colts and really didn't get away great although the colt was in 
good position by the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell had gotten Angus Hall, the other elimination winner,  
out of the No. 9 post fast and by the time the leaders reached the 
first turn, Angus Hall, Pearsall Hanover and Self Possessed were 
near the front. 
</P>
<P>
	Lachance played hardball with Campbell and forced Angus Hall  
three-wide but Campbell got to the lead as the field reached the 
backstretch after a 27.2 first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed didn't stay behind long and Lachance put him on  
the lead halfway down the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
	CR Renegade, who beat Self Possessed in the Beacon Course Trot  
final a month ago, made a bold challenge as Self Possessed reached 
the final turn. For a split second, it appeared Rod Allen and CR 
Renegade would take the lead, but Lachance asked Self Possessed for 
more and the colt gave it to him. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the stretch, Self Possessed had a 2 1/2 length lead  
and he was never challenged in the stretch, with Lachance letting 
him drift out just so he would not break stride. 
</P>
<P>
	Raffaello Ambrosio finished fourth and was followed by Cherry  
Hills, Comets Tail, Davanti, Pearsall Hanover, CR Renegade and CR 
Commando, who broke early in denying 69-year-old trainer-driver 
Carl Allen his first Hambletonian win. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell scored his first victory in the Hambletonian Oaks just  
two races before the colt final, rallying favored Oolong in the 
stretch for a 1 1/2 length win over Lovelytobehold. The 3-year-old 
daughter of Armbro Goal out of China Tea trotted the mile in 
1:54.4.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Debate Role of Truth in Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Some call the U.S. legal system a ``sporting''  
way of seeking justice, with winners and losers as well as promises 
that lawyers will keep their clients' secrets. But where does the 
truth come in? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not as simple as finding the truth,'' Monica Lewinsky's  
former lawyer, William Ginsburg, said as legal experts and 
religious leaders Saturday debated the role of truth in the law at 
the American Bar Association's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a sporting system of justice. Everybody wants to  
win,'' said Los Angeles lawyer Johnnie Cochran Jr., who won O.J. 
Simpson's acquittal on murder charges. For defense lawyers, he 
said, ``You're there to protect the client.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's a lawyer to do when a client confesses to a murder?  
</P>
<P>
	Moderator Charles J. Ogletree Jr., a Harvard law professor, spun  
a tale of a man who stabbed a woman and then confessed to his 
lawyer or minister under a promise of secrecy. Such confidentiality 
is one of the oldest traditions of the U.S. legal system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who would call the police?'' Ogletree asked the panel.  
</P>
<P>
	``The victim is dead?'' asked lawyer and author Ann H. Coulter,  
meaning the victim could not be helped by calling an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	``And you've asked me not to?'' said the Rev. Calvin O. Butts  
III, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we're in our professional capacity?'' asked Stephen  
Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the lawyers or ministers said they would call the  
police, although several said they would try to persuade the man to 
turn himself in. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do we explain to the public what just happened?'' Ogletree  
said. ``Because of our professions we can do nothing. I have the 
ultimate power as a client to muzzle every one of you people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coulter said the adversarial legal system ``has become an end in  
itself for most lawyers,'' adding that she saw nothing wrong with a 
lawyer suggesting a client confess to the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Bright countered that as a defense lawyer, ``my responsibility  
is to make it clear to them ... they don't have to confess to 
anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford law professor Deborah L. Rhode said, ``Truth is a  
value, but it's not the only value. We are also concerned about 
individual rights. We need someone to challenge the government's 
case. Protecting the guilty really does protect the innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton took a verbal beating from panelists for his  
actions during the Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Clinton, everybody knew immediately, I think, that he was  
lying,'' Butts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode said she thought the president got poor legal advice at  
times but that he had ``some loose connections to the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should tar and feather all of the lawyers,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said Clinton's lawyers could not be blamed for his  
infamous statement before a grand jury -- ``It depends upon what the 
meaning of the word 'is' is.'' Said Rhode: ``That was the client.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard law professor David B. Wilkins wondered, ``Was Clinton  
more likely to do that because of the training he had as a 
lawyer?'' 
</P>
<P>
	One truth of the legal system, Bright suggested, is that ``the  
kind of justice a person gets in America today depends completely 
on how much money he has.'' Without an adequate legal defense, he 
said, ``The jury's not going to get the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the audience, Chicago attorney G. Marc Whitehead,  
said it may be unrealistic to expect the legal system to find the 
truth. ``We would be better off if we said our job is to present a 
fair playing field, so disputes can be fairly resolved,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Butts said it may not always be clear what the truth is.  
</P>
<P>
	But he added that if he were heading to a police station with a  
potential defendant, ``I may have a heavenly savior, but Johnnie 
Cochran is going to be my earthly savior.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Sign Goalie Fitzpatrick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- The Carolina Hurricanes signed veteran  
goaltender Mark Fitzpatrick today. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Fitzpatrick was 6-8-6 and a 2.64 goals against average in 27  
appearances with the Chicago Blackhawks last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old has also played for Los Angeles, the New York  
Islanders, Florida and Tampa Bay in 11 NHL seasons. He has a career 
record of 113-134-49 with a 3.11 goals against average. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzpatrick is expected to back up all-star goalie Arturs Irbe.  
Carolina left former starter Trevor Kidd unprotected in June's NHL 
expansion draft. Kidd was claimed by Atlanta but later traded to 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Jablonski, who spent most of last season with New Haven of  
the American Hockey League, also remains in the Hurricanes' farm 
system.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Adds Another Pitcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- With two months of the season left, the Seattle  
Mariners are on the verge of setting a team record for pitchers 
used in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Saturday night's game with the New York Yankees, the  
Mariners recalled right-hander Todd Williams from Triple-A Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Williams, 28, the Mariners optioned outfielder  
Shane Monahan back to their Pacific Coast League farm club. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, acquired in a trade with Cincinnati on July 22, will  
be the 26th pitcher to be used this season, a club record and most 
in the majors. Williams also will be the 14th rookie pitcher used 
by Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5.78, the Mariners had the worst ERA in the American League  
before Saturday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams pitched for Team USA at the Pan American Games this  
summer, helping the Americans win a silver medal and qualify for 
the 2000 Olympics. He made his debut in Tacoma on Friday night, 
pitching 1 2-3 shutout innings for a save in the Rainiers' 5-3 win 
against Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	At Triple-A Indianapolis this season, Williams was 1-3 with a  
5.10 ERA in 38 games and 42 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 0-1 with a 7.71 ERA in six games and 9 1-3 innings in  
Cincinnati last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Monahan, 24, played in two games and had two at bats after being  
recalled by the Mariners from Tacoma July 29. He was Seattle's left 
fielder in the second half of last season, playing in 60 games and 
hitting .242 with four home runs and 28 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Thomas Hits Career Homer No. 300 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- White Sox slugger Frank Thomas hit a solo  
homer into the left-field seats off Oakland starter Kevin Appier 
with one out in the sixth inning for his 300th career home run. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas becomes the 84th player in major league baseball history  
to record 300 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas also becomes the fifth active player to record at least  
300 homers, 1,000 RBI (1,031) and 1,000 walks (1,050). He joins San 
Francisco's Barry Bonds, Tampa Bay's Fred McGriff, St. Louis' Mark 
McGwire and Baltimore's Cal Ripken, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has three career home runs and is batting .360  
(18-for-50) lifetime against Appier.

	S. Korea Child Fire Victims Mourned  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A mass funeral was held today for the  
19 kindergarten children who died in a pre-dawn fire while at 
summer camp. In Seoul's sun-Olympic Park, 1,200 family members and 
government officials stood silently with bowed heads, stifling sobs 
with handkerchiefs. Marine guards played a funeral dirge. The June 
29 blaze gutted a three-story dormitory at the Sealand Youth 
Training Center in Hwasung County, 60 miles southeast of Seoul. 
Four adults also were killed.

	Gunmen Seize Russian Villages  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- About 500 gunmen seized two villages today in the  
southern Russian republic of Dagestan near its border with 
breakaway Chechnya, news reports said. The militants crossed from 
Chechnya into Dagestan early today and occupied the villages of 
Ansalt and Rakhat, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Dagestan 
Interior Ministry officials as saying. Dagestani authorities said 
the gunmen appeared to be from the same group blamed for an attack 
on a neighboring region last week, the fundamentalist Wahhabi 
Islamic movement. No casualties were immediately reported.

	Thousands Battle Nevada Wildfires  
</P>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Three thousand firefighters continued battling  
more than 100 brush fires that have burned an area nearly the size 
of Rhode Island and were threatening some homes. At 611,000 acres 
and growing, the fires threatened ranches and homes near the Oregon 
border, and smoke intermittently forced the closure of Interstate 
80 yesterday near Lovelock, Winnemucca, Battle Mountain and Elko. 
Firefighters said last night they had fully contained one of the 
worst blazes, Idaho's Mule Butte fire that had burned more than 
92,500 acres.

<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Two more members of a banned Chinese dissident  
group have been detained by police, a group that monitors dissident 
activity said today. Chen Wei and Ouyang Yi were taken away 
yesterday and early today, respectively, in Suining, a city in the 
western province of Sichuan, the Hong Kong-based Information Center 
of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. Chen and 
Ouyang are members of the China Democracy Party, a group set up 
last year to challenge the Chinese Communist Party's monopoly on 
power.

	NATO Concerned Over Peackeeper Attacks

<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO officials are worried over an  
increase of violence aimed at international peacekeepers in the 
alliance's force in Kosovo. The attacts are considered a threat to 
the ability of NATO and the United Nations to set up a civil 
administration in Kosovo to run the territory until elections can 
be held. Meanwhile, efforts are continuing to establish a strong 
international police force in Kosovo.

	Turkish Union Leader Fatally Shot

	ZONGULDAK, Turkey (AP) -- The deputy head of Turkey's largest  
labor union confederation was shot to death outside his home early 
today in the Black Sea coastal city of Zonguldak, the Anatolia news 
agency said. Semsi Denizer, 49, became popular when he led some 
50,000 striking coal miners on a 165-mile protest march from 
Zonguldak to the capital, Ankara, for higher pay in 1991. He was 
general-secretary of the Turk-Is labor confederation. The 
assailant, Cengiz Balik, who has a long criminal record, was 
arrested after the attack, police said.

Taylor will be joined today by running back Eric Dickerson, 
offensive guards Tom Mack and Billy Shaw and tight end Ozzie 
Newsome for their induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
Taylor retired with two Super Bowl rings and a glittering stack of 
statistics. He had 142 sacks in his career and all but 
revolutionized his position with his athleticism and mental 
approach. Former Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann 
said, ``If there ever was a Superman in the NFL, I think he wore 
number 56 for the Giants.''

<HEADLINE> Governors Ponder Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Ten governors swapped veto pens for neon  
crayons Saturday as they followed a 10-year-old's drawing 
directions during an exercise designed to showcase high-achieving 
youngsters at a magnet school. 
</P>
<P>
	The assignment from sixth-grader Janay Anderson was amusing, but  
the governors' goal was serious: boosting student achievement by 
changing how students are taught -- and finding money to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Education is the theme of the four-day meeting of the National  
Governors Association, with 45 chief executives scheduled to attend 
meetings on school accountability, harnessing technology and new 
ways of teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	For a classroom experience, the governors came to Gateway  
Elementary, a math, science and technology magnet school in the 
city's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The group did its best to draw the friendly monster, as  
instructed. Each drawing turned out about the same: creatures with 
an L-shaped nose, a square orange head topped by a crown, three 
orange fingers on each hand and purple boots with toes jutting 
outward. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've finally found something I can do well,'' joked GOP Gov.  
William Janklow of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The school, a product of federal court-ordered desegregation  
funding, cost $25 million to build and millions more to operate 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a desegregation settlement, the state's forced spending is  
coming to an end. But the school holds such promise as a model for 
the future of learning that the city school board has committed to 
continued funding, said the board president, Marlene Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	She said neither Gateway's cost nor its ambitious programs  
should frighten the governors. The schools offers five computers 
with Internet capability per classroom; a courtyard that is also a 
classroom, complete with a prairie, windmill and weather station; 
and one teacher and a student teacher for every 24 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway is open to any student in St. Louis public schools. They  
are selected by lottery, and there is a 1,000-student waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, St. Louis school officials said the quality of learning  
at Gateway increasingly is available at other city schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is doable in other states. The first thing you have to do  
is make a commitment to make it happen,'' Davis said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors are exploring creative ways to find money for  
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Democratic Gov. Thomas Carper of Delaware said his  
state set aside $30 million from a court settlement to wire all 
classrooms for the Internet. In Minnesota, Reform Party Gov. Jesse 
Ventura supported extra state aid for schools that met goals of 
reducing class sizes to 17 students for every teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri has made technology grants available to all schools,  
and that money usually is matched locally, said Democratic Gov. Mel 
Carnahan. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's Michael Leavitt, a Republican who is the incoming  
chairman of the governors' group, urged building ``ubiquitous 
capacity'' for students and teachers to reach high-speed Internet 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
	That is just what was displayed at Gateway, where Janay and her  
classmates have an electronic friendship with a two-room elementary 
school in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important for students to go beyond classroom walls,''  
said Janay, who told Carper she aims to become a corporate lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is you will be -- and I want to buy stock in the  
corporation,'' Carper replied.

<HEADLINE> Ford Defends U. Mich Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lawsuits challenging the University of  
Michigan's affirmative action policies threaten to destroy what is 
now ``the finest educational environment for all students,'' former 
President Gerald R. Ford wrote in an opinion piece published 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, a 1935 University of Michigan graduate, wrote in Sunday  
editions of The New York Times that the lawsuits could reverse a 
century of hard-won progress toward racial justice. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory by the plaintiffs ``would scuttle Michigan's current  
system, one that takes into account nearly a dozen elements -- race, 
economic standing, geographic origin, athletic and artistic 
achievement among them -- to create the finest educational 
environment for all students,'' Ford wrote. ``This eminently 
reasonable approach, as thoughtful as it is fair, has produced a 
student body with a significant minority component whose record of 
academic success is outstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuits were filed in 1997 by three white  
applicants alleging that the university rejected them because of 
their race. With the guidance of a conservative legal group, the 
three are seeking to force the main undergraduate college and law 
school to ignore race in admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court is currently considering whether outside  
groups can intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford recalled the racial climate of his senior year at Michigan  
in 1935, when he and his teammates were preparing for a football 
game against Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Among the best players on that year's Michigan squad was  
Willis Ward, a close friend of mine whom the Southern school 
reputedly wanted dropped from our roster because he was black,'' 
Ford wrote. ``My classmates were just as adamant that he should 
take the field. In the end, Willis decided on his own not to play. 
... His sacrifice led me to question how educational administrators 
could capitulate to raw prejudice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want future college students to suffer the cultural  
and social impoverishment that afflicted my generation,'' he wrote.

<HEADLINE> Report: NCAA Violation at Notre Dame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Notre Dame officials anticipate a ruling from the  
NCAA that the school's football program has committed a major 
violation of the organization's rules, according to a published 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	They expect the NCAA's Committee on Infractions to determine  
that members of the athletic department should have done more to 
learn of gifts football players received from convicted embezzler 
Kim Dunbar, the Chicago Tribune reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunbar embezzled more than $1.2 million from the South Bend firm  
where she worked as a bookkeeper, providing players, their families 
and friends with more than $35,000 in gifts and trips. Her 
admission that she gave money to players led to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	A person familiar with the university's interests, speaking on  
the condition of anonymity, said the committee was expected to 
maintain that Dunbar's gifts could have been discovered earlier had 
members of then-coach Lou Holtz's staff brought information to 
Notre Dame officials in charge of NCAA compliance, the Tribune 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials did not immediately return phone messages  
left Saturday by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma law professor David Swank, chairman of the infractions  
committee, told The AP this week that a decision was not expected 
to be released in the case for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune also cited its unidentified source in reporting that  
Notre Dame would not necessarily appeal a major violation, choosing 
instead to place the already embarrassing episode in its past. 
</P>
<P>
	Findings of a major violation would overrule what was described  
as a surprisingly strong assertion by the NCAA's enforcement staff. 
The Tribune reported that its source said enforcement 
representatives maintained during a closed-door hearing on June 4 
that Notre Dame players and staff members had not knowingly 
violated any rules, had been vigilant in the reporting process, had 
not gained any advantage as a result of Dunbar's gifts and had not 
shown a failure of institutional control. 
</P>
<P>
	Several people with knowledge of the hearing said the session  
was often contentious, the Tribune reported. Speaking only if they 
would not be quoted, they said committee members were skeptical 
that athletic department officials in a relatively small university 
community were not more aware of Dunbar's gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunbar pleaded guilty last September to two Class C felony theft  
charges for embezzling the money. She was sentenced to four years 
in prison, meaning she would be eligible for release after two 
years with good behavior. She was also ordered to serve probation 
until 2014. 
</P>
<P>
	But her attorney said this week that Dunbar's release has been  
moved up to Oct. 17 because she earned an associate's degree from 
Indiana while in prison, qualifying for a new state law that 
rewards inmates for earning educational degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame coach Bob Davie said Friday he had no reason to  
believe an NCAA decision was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect it to come sometime during the season,'' he said  
during a news conference marking the start of fall practice, ``and 
we'll deal with it when it comes.''

<HEADLINE> President Lauds Author Willie Morris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Author Willie Morris was ``the classic  
Southerner'' who helped outward-looking young people recognize they 
could love the South ``and want to change it at the same time,'' 
President Clinton writes in Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippian Morris died Monday of a heart attack at age 64. He  
wrote more than a dozen books during a wide-ranging career as 
journalist, editor and novelist. At 33, he became the youngest 
editor ever of Harper's Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	In a two-paragraph essay that Time released Saturday, Clinton  
wrote that he met Morris in New York in 1968, the year after he 
took over at Harper's. Clinton, just selected for a Rhodes 
scholarship, had written former Rhodes scholar Morris asking for a 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``To my surprise, he agreed to see me. He was wonderfully wry  
and funny -- the classic Southerner,'' Clinton wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, for most of my generation of Southerners who went  
North, the book that stuck in their minds was (Thomas Wolfe's) `You 
Can't Go Home Again.' Willie's `North Toward Home' was a 
beautifully written evocative portrait of one person's love for the 
South who had profound regret over the racial situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wrote that Morris' perspective ``helped a lot of people  
like me who wanted to see the world and do well up North but also 
come home and live in the South. He showed us how we could love a 
place and want to change it at the same time. ... He showed us we 
could go home.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Speaks at Rainbow/PUSH Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Al Gore was up to scaling Mount Rainier, but on  
Saturday the vice president didn't take on a direct challenge from 
presidential campaign rival Bill Bradley on a racial issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first appearance since spending the week climbing Mount  
Rainier with his 16-year-old son, Gore spoke to the annual 
Rainbow/PUSH convention in a speech rich with Clinton 
administration themes. 
</P>
<P>
	But he had no direct response to Bradley's comments Thursday to  
the civil rights organization in which the former senator said Gore 
should help bring an immediate end to racial profiling -- the 
targeting of minorities during traffic stops and airport searches. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore last month said putting a stop to racial profiling would be  
his ``first civil rights act of the new century,'' but Bradley said 
the vice president should push President Clinton to immediately 
sign an executive order banning such practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore did call for an end to arrests based on ``hollow  
stereotypes'' on Saturday, but did not directly address Bradley's 
comments. In fact, the vice president has yet to publicly 
acknowledge Bradley as his opponent for the Democratic presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore drew several standing ovations from the Rainbow/PUSH  
crowd of about 400 at the city's lakefront McCormick Place, 
mentioning tax cuts for the poor, the Clinton-Gore ``Patient's Bill 
of Rights'' and other such themes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You better bet that American still needs affirmative action,''  
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Jackson, president of Rainbow/PUSH, had high praise for  
Gore, saying ``his campaign and his quest will make America 
better,'' but he said it's still too early to commit his support to 
either Gore or Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore thanked the civil rights leader for comforting his family  
after the death last December of his father, Albert Gore Sr. The 
elder Gore, also a former Tennessee senator like his son, was a 
longtime supporter of civil rights and lost a re-election bid after 
backing the Voting Rights Act in 1965.

<HEADLINE> Watergate Source Remains Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a city where even the kinkiest details of a  
president's sex life can end up on the front pages, one big secret 
has remained secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Who was ``Deep Throat''?  
</P>
<P>
	For more than a quarter-century, journalists, pundits,  
historians and politicians have tried to divine the identity of the 
Nixon White House insider who kept a pair of resourceful young 
Washington Post reporters steps ahead of the competition on the 
news story of their generation. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation has ranged from Alexander Haig to Diane Sawyer, who  
both deny being perhaps the century's most famous anonymous news 
source. 
</P>
<P>
	Another theory maintains there was no actual ``Deep Throat,''  
that the source was rather a composite, a fictional device created 
by the writers to provide cover for numerous Nixon White House 
leakers and to spice up their best-selling book and blockbuster 
movie, ``All the President's Men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No way, say the reporters, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward.  
``Deep Throat,'' they insist, is a real person whose identity 
they've sworn to keep secret until he dies. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Deep Throat' does exist,'' Bernstein has said. ``He was and  
is one person -- exactly who we have said, a highly placed official 
in the executive branch. ... If we had made up 'Deep Throat,' we 
would have been fired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other names from the Nixon administration on the list of  
possible suspects include: Assistant Attorney General Henry 
Petersen, Deputy White House Counsel Fred Fielding, FBI Director L. 
Patrick Gray, Nixon lawyer Leonard Garment and the late William 
Casey, a government official who later became CIA director. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodward, who continues to write for the Post and is the author  
of ``Shadow,'' a new book that examines the effects of Watergate on 
the men who've occupied the White House since Nixon's resignation 
in 1974, says honoring his promise to ``Deep Throat'' helps him 
convince people he's serious about keeping confidential sources 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	Katharine Graham, the Post's publisher during the Watergate era,  
wrote in her memoirs that her newspaper's top editor, Ben Bradlee, 
assured her of ``Deep Throat's'' reliability. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's why I remain convinced that there was such a person and  
that he ... was neither made up nor an amalgam or a composite of a 
number of people, as has often been hypothesized,'' she wrote.

on NASCAR's Winston Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Speedway Motorsports Inc. is planning to start holding World of  
Outlaws races next year at its Winston Cup properties in Atlanta, 
Charlotte, Dallas and Las Vegas and televise them on The Nashville 
Network, industry sources told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	A news conference to announce the partnership is scheduled for  
Tuesday at Lowe's Motor Speedway at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement calls for Concord-based SMI, which holds nearly  
one-third of the races on NASCAR's top circuit, to build half-mile 
dirt tracks at its Winston Cup properties in Georgia, North 
Carolina and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's Las Vegas Motor Speedway already has a half-mile  
dirt track on its property for World of Outlaws cars and has 
experienced success with the sprint-car circuit. Las Vegas has two 
weekends of racing each year for the winged, open-wheel cars and 
has sold out the events at its 12,000-seat facility, which sits 
about one-fourth of a mile behind the main speedway where the 
Winston Cup cars run. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement would improve the visibility of the World of  
Outlaws series, a circuit that several recent surveys have shown to 
be one of the fastest-growing in racing. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal also would provide another revenue stream for SMI,  
which draws the bulk of its profits from races involving stock 
car's top two circuits, the Winston Cup and Busch Grand National 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	SMI officials hope the World of Outlaws cars will be a more  
steady revenue source than the 3-year-old Indy Racing League, which 
has struggled to draw consistent crowds at company facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The only SMI track that has been able to annually draw IRL  
crowds in excess of 50,000 is Texas Motor Speedway, where IRL 
ticket sales are tied into those for the track's Winston Cup 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, Charlotte and Las Vegas have had difficulty making  
money on IRL events, and SMI is considering dropping the series at 
Charlotte, where three spectators were killed during the circuit's 
race in May.

<HEADLINE> Tighter Security Protects Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The sign says FBI tours are closed due to  
``capacity visitation.'' A steady stream of visitors is being 
turned away from the J. Edgar Hoover Building, however, because of 
the threat of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	It's just one of an abundance of tight security measures imposed  
in the capital surrounding today's first anniversary of the bombing 
of two U.S. embassies in Africa. With what officials see as an 
increasing threat of both domestic and international terrorism, 
security has been getting progressively tighter over the last 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout Washington, metal detectors, armed guards and  
anti-bomb barriers disguised as mammoth planters are becoming as 
prominent as statues and national monuments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand, but you're not safe anywhere really,'' said  
Mike Kasper of New Baltimore, Mich. His wife, Penny, said the 
family had hoped to view the FBI's renowned collection of 
confiscated weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The capital never has suffered a major terrorist attack, but  
persistent threats and violent acts around the globe are prompting 
ever-heavier security in a city that attracts guests ranging from 
heads of state to hordes of local and international tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pennsylvania Avenue was closed off in front of the White House  
and barricades erected at several federal offices after Middle East 
terrorists hit the World Trade Center in 1993. That security 
remains in place. 
</P>
<P>
	--Metal detectors and new security walls went up at more  
buildings and monuments after domestic terrorists killed 168 people 
at the Oklahoma City federal building. 
</P>
<P>
	--Concrete and steel barricades now wall off the State  
Department, erected since the dual embassy bombings, which killed 
224, including 12 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department on Thursday renewed a warning for all  
Americans worldwide to avoid routines, be suspicious of unfamiliar 
packages and ``keep a low profile'' abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence of how caught up the city is in protecting itself came  
early Friday when federal agents with firemen and a bomb squad 
received word of a possible bomb-making operation and raided a 
house in a quiet neighborhood far from the monuments. Containers 
seen carried into the building turned out to be part of a 
neighborhood plan to store water for the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department, concrete barriers have ringed the  
building since the embassy bombings, with driveways blocked by 
metal barriers that rise from the ground or by vans moved only for 
authorized vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department's main entrance on C Street, where visitors  
used to be dropped off from an elegant circular driveway, is now 
blocked. Taxis and limousines leave passengers at the curb. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest security web affects millions of tourists,  
constituents and residents who pass through metal detectors, submit 
to probing questions and get pinned with tags whenever they visit 
federal offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists generally take the security measures in stride.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure the FBI has better things to do than worry about  
tourists,'' said Rita Delrue of Minnetonka, Minn., touring the city 
with relatives from Belgium. Told of terrorist threats, she said, 
``Then it's even more sensible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, metal detectors and other measures have been  
used for years, but ordinary people wander most hallways. Unlike 
procedures in most federal offices, people enter the Capitol or its 
surrounding offices without identification. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the tightest security is at the Pentagon, but its main  
entrance doubles as a major station for Washington's subway and 
suburban bus systems through which thousands pass without security 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Security at the city's most prominent target -- the White House --  
has increased steadily since the late 1980s after an assassination 
attempt on President Reagan at the entrance to a Washington hotel. 
Sharpshooters patrol the roof, and armed officers guard gates to 
the 18-acre compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Pennsylvania Avenue closure, it remains paved. And  
in a side-benefit of tight security, it is open to pedestrians, 
skateboarders and occasional informal street games.

<HEADLINE> LT, Dickerson, Newsome Enter Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Being humble did not get Lawrence Taylor to  
the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet that's what LT was Saturday, a few hours before his official  
induction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started out just wanting to play high school ball, then  
succeed in college,'' said the player who redefined the outside 
linebacker position in 13 seasons with the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I wanted to make it in the pros, make All-Pro and finally  
make it to the Hall of Fame. If nothing else goes right in my life, 
at least that was one thing I did that was complete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That last reference was to Taylor's well-publicized, off-field  
problems, including drug arrests and suspensions and financial 
woes. But in the past month, as he's prepared for his induction, he 
seems to have tried to come to terms with his troubled past -- 
suggesting, for example, that he's grateful it was he rather than 
his children who had bouts with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Inducted with Taylor, who made the Hall on the first ballot  
despite the controversy about his election, were: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Eric Dickerson, the third-leading rusher in NFL history and  
another first-ballot electee; 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tom Mack and Billy Shaw, only the fourth and fifth guards  
elected, and; 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ozzie Newsome, the tight end who played his entire career 60  
miles away with the Cleveland Browns and is now personnel director 
of the Baltimore Ravens. Newsome left Cleveland with the team when 
owner Art Modell moved to Baltimore after the 1995 season. He 
wondered about his welcome here. 
</P>
<P>
	All were a bit tired after two days of breakfasts, lunches,  
dinners, parades and other functions that surround the induction. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Taylor, they all seemed a bit awed.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the one team you cant be traded from, cut by, or  
retire from,'' Newsome said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, outside of northern Ohio, where Newsome played and Mack  
grew up, most of the attention was on Taylor, who would have been 
an automatic, non-debatable choice if not for his off-field 
headlines. He still made it, but only after prolonged public 
discussion during Super Bowl week, when the vote was taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said the three people who most influenced his career with  
the Giants from 1981-93 were Bill Parcells, who coached him on 
Super Bowl winners in 1986 and 1990; George Young, the general 
manager then, and Wellington Mara, the owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``He probably cared more about me as a person than he really  
should have,'' Taylor said, referring to Mara, who has helped him 
with his personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	And speaking about Parcells, now coach of the New York Jets, he  
said: 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like one of those marriages that's been going for 30  
years. You really don't talk much, but you know you love each 
other.''

 *Byron Farwell    	
</P>
<P>
	LEESBURG, Va. (AP) -- Byron Farwell, author of military books and  
former Hillsboro mayor, died Tuesday after a heart attack. He was 
78. 
</P>
<P>
	Farwell, who specialized in British warfare, wrote 13 books.  
Among his works are ``Queen Victoria's Little Wars,' ``Mr. 
Kipling's Army,'' and a biography of journalist Henry M. Stanley, 
``The Man Who Presumed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 14th book, the Encyclopedia of 19th-Century Land Warfare,  
will be published next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Farwell's interest in military history began with his Amry  
service during the invasion of North Africa in World War II, and in 
the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Manchester, Iowa, he worked for the Chrysler Corp.  
from 1954 to 1971 before moving to Hillsboro, a town of about 125 
people. He was mayor from 1976 to 1982. He lost the election for a 
fourth term after a 17-17 vote. To break the tie, a name was drawn 
from a punch bowl. 

</P>

</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Rozelar Goode, a former sharecropper and  
laundry worker who raised seven children, including former Mayor W. 
Wilson Goode, died Thursday of heart failure. She was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	``She taught me that hard work, education and honesty will take  
you where you need to go,'' the former mayor said. ``She always 
told me not to worry, everything was taken care of, and you know, 
she was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Goode was born in North Carolina, where she was a  
sharecropper with her husband, Albert, for more than three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The family moved to Philadelphia in 1954, as machines began to  
replace manual labor on the farms. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Goode was very active in various churches for more than 75  
years.

 *Harry Litwack    	
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Retired Temple University basketball coach  
Harry Litwack, whose 21-year reign included the 1969 NIT 
championship, died Saturday of a stroke. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Litwack, a cigar-smoking gentleman known as ``The Chief,'' had  
been battling a spinal disease for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached the Owls from 1952 until his retirement in 1973.  
Litwack's reign included an 89-75 victory over Boston College for 
the 1969 NIT title, and he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of 
Fame in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Litwack also led the Owls to the NCAA Final Four in 1956 and  
1958, where the team finished third both times. 
</P>
<P>
	Litwack's 373-193 record also made him the second-winningest  
coach in Temple University, after being surpassed by current head 
coach John Chaney in February.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Kazuo Miyagawa, cinematographer for ``Rashomon''  
and other Japanese film classics, died Saturday of kidney failure. 
He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyagawa's technique is characterized by balanced composition  
and unobtrusive camera handling. His hand-held camera work in 
``Tokyo Olympiad,'' directed by Kon Ichikawa in 1965, established 
new methods for making documentary films. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kyoto native joined Japan's major film production company,  
Nikkatsu Corp., in 1926 after graduating from Kyoto Commercial 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950, he filmed the award-winning ``Rashomon,'' directed by  
the late Akira Kurosawa. Three years later, he filmed another 
classic, ``Ugetsu,'' with late director Kenji Mizoguchi.

</P>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Kathryn Murray, widow of famed dance instructor  
Arthur Murray, died Friday. She was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	The Murrays met at a Newark, N.J., radio station when she was  
18. They married about four months later in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	They were co-hosts of his television show, ``The Arthur Murray  
Dance Party,'' which ran from 1950 to 1960 and featured such guests 
as Helen Hayes and Milton Berle. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray sold his chain of dance studios in 1952, but remained  
president until 1964. The couple moved to Hawaii the following 
year.

	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Puey Ungphakorn, a former central bank  
official and leading intellectual in postwar Thailand, died July 28 
at his home in London. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Puey was the former head of Bangkok's Thammasat University. He  
had lived in self-imposed exile since a 1976 coup, in which police 
and right-wing mobs killed scores of students staging a peaceful 
demonstration at the university. 
</P>
<P>
	Puey's three sons announced their father died after suffering  
abdominal pains, the ITV television network reported Friday. One of 
the sons, Jon Ungphakorn, told the Bangkok Post that blood vessels 
in his father's stomach lining burst, causing internal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Puey was part of the Free Thai resistance movement to Japanese  
occupation during World War II. He joined the central bank in the 
1950s as an economist, eventually becoming governor. He was 
credited with turning the Bank of Thailand into one of the most 
independent, competent financial institutions in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Married To See Biggest Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The rich might get the most money back from  
the Republican tax cut, but married couples with incomes of 
$100,000 or less would see the largest percentage reduction in 
income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year, $792 billion tax cut approved by Congress would  
have widely differing effects on individual taxpayers, depending on 
their marital status, number of children, investments and claimed 
deductions, according to an analysis by the Deloitte &AMP; Touche 
accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of total dollars, the wealthiest taxpayers would get  
the most money back -- about 60 percent of the overall cut would go 
to the top 10 percent income bracket. But married couples of 
middle- and upper-middle class incomes would benefit from the 
largest percentage cut in taxes owed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Republican analysis, Deloitte &AMP; Touche found that married  
couples earning between $50,000 and $100,000 -- with or without 
children -- would see tax reductions of 6.8 percent to 17.9 percent 
if the Republican tax bill became law today. 
</P>
<P>
	Single people in those same income categories, however, would  
receive a tax cut of 4.4 percent to 5.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	This is partly because lawmakers targeted the ``marriage  
penalty'' now paid by millions of two-income couples by proposing 
to double the standard deduction for joint tax filers and 
increasing the amount of income subject to the lowest income tax 
rate -- currently 15 percent but 14 percent under the GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, married couples with children, and those with  
children in college, can lower their taxes under current law by 
claiming $500-a-child and education tax credits. Those credits 
would not change. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, delivering the Republican Party's  
weekly radio address today, said his fellow GOP state executives 
have led the way in cutting tax by recognizing that ``your tax 
dollars belong to you -- not us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keating said opponents of the state tax cuts -- ``mostly  
Democrats'' -- predicted that ``doom and gloom would descend if 
state governments let taxpayers keep a few extra dollars. Well, 
those state governments are still in business -- in fact, they're 
being run more efficiently than ever before. And the citizens of 
those states are enjoying real prosperity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican bill, which President Clinton on Friday again  
threatened to veto as too large, would make dozens of changes to 
tax laws affecting individuals and business, but the analysis 
focused on the sections that would affect the greatest number of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	These include a 1-percentage-point reduction in all five income  
tax rates, a doubling of the standard deduction for married people, 
a widening of the lowest tax bracket for married people and a cut 
in capital gains taxes on investments from 20 percent to 18 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the cuts would be phased in between 2000 and 2009 and  
are not fully in effect until the final year, Deloitte &AMP; Touche 
examined what would happen if all changes were in place for the 
current 1999 tax year. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a look at five different scenarios if the GOP tax cut  
proposals were in effect: 
</P>
<P>
	--A single taxpayer with no children earning $35,000 a year with  
no capital gains tax and standard deductions would owe $4,199 in 
income taxes, compared with $4,479 under current law. That's a 6.2 
percent cut and a savings of $280. 
</P>
<P>
	--A married couple with no children earning $48,500 a year and  
$1,500 in capital gains -- with itemized deductions of $12,500 -- 
would owe $4,405, down from $4,725, a cut of 6.8 percent and 
savings of $320. 
</P>
<P>
	--A married couple with two children under age 17 earning $72,750  
and $2,250 in capital gains with $15,750 in itemized deductions 
would owe $5,643, down from $6,734. That's a 16.2 percent tax cut, 
or $1,091. 
</P>
<P>
	--A married couple with one child under 17 and one in college,  
earning $100,000 a year including $3,000 in capital gains -- and 
$20,000 in itemized deductions -- would owe $11,165, down from 
$12,984. That's a drop of 14 percent, or $1,819. 
</P>
<P>
	--A married couple with no children earning $1 million a year,  
including $30,000 in capital gains, with $153,798 in itemized 
deductions would owe $292,517, down from $302,377. That's a cut of 
3.3 percent, or $9,861.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Has 2 RBIs in Minors Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry continued his comeback  
from a drug suspension Saturday with two hits and two RBIs in the 
first game of a Triple-A doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry doubled in the second inning and singled in the fifth  
to drive in two runs in the Columbus Clippers' 7-4 victory over 
Charlotte in the International League. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who went 2-for-3 batting fourth and playing left  
field, also struck out looking in the third. He is batting .400 
(6-for-15) in four games with Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was playing for the New York Yankees last season when  
he was diagnosed with colon cancer. His return to the majors was 
delayed in April when he was arrested on solicitation and drug 
charges and suspended from baseball for 120 days.

<HEADLINE> GOP Govs. Eye Tax Cut Plan Warily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Suspicious of their party leaders in  
Washington, Republican governors applauded Congress' tax cut plan 
Saturday but warned that they will not let GOP lawmakers raid state 
budgets to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican congressional leaders have considered asking the  
nation's governors to return up to $6 billion in welfare money to 
help balance the books on their 10-year, $792 billion tax cut 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Several governors accused fellow Republicans in Washington of  
trying to renege on pledges to ship the money to states. They 
suggested the development could damage their promised partnership 
with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``This must be a calamitous staff error, because I can't believe  
they would do this to us, said Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, 
attending the four-day National Governors' Association meeting, 
which opened Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would lose a great deal of credibility and I don't think  
they want to do that,'' said Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, a 
national leader on welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing force in Republican politics, the GOP governors said  
they are confident congressional leaders are preparing to back 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	But even the prospect of success has not dampened the state  
leaders' bitterness. For most governors, the first word of a plan 
to seek state money came from press accounts -- not their leadership 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Governors do not like being kept out of the loop, especially  
after the leadership promised in 1998 to give them a greater role 
in framing policy and political strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``With any partnership, you've got to make sure your partner is  
reliable,'' Gov. John Engler of Michigan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors' stock rose after huge victories in the 1998  
elections underscored the popularity of their mainstream, can-do 
politics while confrontational congressional Republicans suffered a 
series of election night defeats. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking the return of money would be an irony for a political  
party whose oft-stated philosophy is to dispense dollars and power 
to the states. It also might force Republican governors to forsake 
tax cuts at home for spending needs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal posed a dilemma for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the  
elected leader of the nation's second-largest state and the 
front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Bush ``supports keeping the funds  
in the states and hopes Congress will listen to the nation's 
governors on this issue.'' Bush was not attending the NAG meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Under welfare reform legislation enacted in 1996, the nation's  
governors were guaranteed current levels of funding for five years. 
Governors lobbied for the guarantee, saying they had assumed a 
heavy risk because the need for welfare money could outstrip the 
supply of federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	The states have dramatically reduced welfare rolls and, in some  
cases, have surplus welfare money. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Gov. Michael Leavitt of Utah, incoming chairman of  
the governors' group, said Congress needs to realize the states are 
done with the easiest part of welfare reform; the toughest and most 
expensive cases -- welfare recipients with the lowest prospect for 
jobs -- remain a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's keep the financial integrity of our relationship (with  
Congress) intact,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of seeking state money was broached last month by Rep.  
Tom DeLay of Texas, the GOP whip, and approved by Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Several governors and their aides said they suspected the idea  
was leaked to reporters to test the level of opposition, which is 
high. Engler said the leadership used the threat to show 
rank-and-file lawmakers what might happen if they propose too much 
new spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fizzled,'' Thompson said of the idea. He and several  
other high-profile state executives personally lobbied 
congressional leaders in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Don Nichols, R-Okla., and Hastert are making separate  
appearances at the governors' meeting and are expected to offer an 
olive branch, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no clear signal Saturday that the leadership was  
backing down. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the House,  
said Saturday he has not heard from an unhappy governor. A second 
House GOP leader, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, was more pointed: 
``If it's good to cut taxes at the state level, it's good to cut 
taxes at the federal level,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both lawmakers spoke in Omaha, Neb., at a gathering of  
Republican activists from the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, former governor of Arkansas, has promised to  
veto the GOP tax plan, and may warn governors in a speech Sunday at 
their meeting that the cuts will hurt state budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute has muted the governors' praise of the congressional  
tax package. Leavitt said he support ``the theory of cutting 
taxes'' but wanted to see the details of the congressional plan 
before endorsing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating delivered the national radio address for the party  
Saturday, criticizing the Clinton-Gore administration's tax 
history. ``They want to use it to buy more government,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 31 Republican governors and 17 Democrats. Gov. Jesse  
Ventura of Minnesota is a member of the Reform Party. Gov. Angus 
King of Maine is an independent.

<HEADLINE>  LT, Others Head Into Football Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- It's been six years since Lawrence Taylor  
ended one of the most successful pro football careers ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 40 years old, he said he has few regrets and has mellowed  
somewhat as he prepares for his induction into the Pro Football 
Hall of Fame this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	But he still has moments when visions of prone running backs  
dance through his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't miss playing the game of football at all, but during  
championship time and during the playoffs, you miss the 
excitement,'' he said. ``Sometimes I find myself dreaming of some 
of the games, reliving the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former New York Giants linebacker will be joined by running  
back Eric Dickerson, offensive guards Tom Mack and Billy Shaw and 
tight end Ozzie Newsome when the class of 1999 is enshrined today 
on the front steps of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor -- who became the fearsome prototype of a rush linebacker  
during his 13 seasons -- never settled for second best from himself 
or his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came to work, I came to work planning on being the  
best,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor retired with two Super Bowl rings and a glittering stack  
of statistics. He had 142 sacks in his career and all but 
revolutionized his position with his athleticism and mental 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was nasty. He's the nastiest kid I've ever been around,''  
said Denny Marcin, the Giants' defensive line coach who also 
coached Taylor at North Carolina. ``If you were lying on the ground 
and he was going back to the huddle, he might kick you in the 
head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann said, ``If  
there ever was a Superman in the NFL, I think he wore number 56 for 
the Giants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since retiring in 1993, Taylor has encountered legal,  
substance-abuse and financial problems. He referred to those who 
didn't vote for his induction as ``old phonies'' who had no 
business judging him. He has since said he spoke out of anger and 
now is thrilled to be entering the elite hall. 
</P>
<P>
	His induction fits neatly into his personal checklist.  
</P>
<P>
	``We do things in packages as far as life goes: high school  
ball, college ball, you want to get in the pros, make All-Pro and 
finally you want to be in the Hall of Fame. That has finally 
happened. I have a complete package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those joining him fit that same description.  
</P>
<P>
	Playing 11 seasons with four teams, Dickerson gained 13,259  
career yards -- third-best behind Walter Payton and Barry Sanders. 
He said his induction is the ultimate compliment. 
</P>
<P>
	``That'll be a proud moment for me,'' he said in a televised  
interview recently. ``I never made it to a Super Bowl. ``For me, 
this shows I did do something right in my sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He topped 1,000 yards in each of his first seven seasons,  
including an NFL-record 2,105 in 1984, while showing the ability to 
run around, over or through defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack, a 6-foot-3, 250-pound offensive guard, played all of his  
13 seasons with the Los Angeles Rams -- going 184 games without 
missing a game due to injury or illness. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to wait 11 years to finally get the call to Canton, while  
Shaw -- a sterling offensive guard for the Buffalo Bills from 1961 
to 1969 who was selected for induction by the veterans committee -- 
waited almost three times that. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were only three guards in the hall. Now he and I make  
five,'' Shaw said. ``I can't explain to you why more guards haven't 
made it into the Hall of Fame. But it's an honor. It'll be fun 
going in with Tom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome caught 662 passes in his 13 years -- all spent as a  
premier receiver and blocker with the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was happy that he had to wait four years for  
induction because it now dovetails with the advent of the new 
Browns franchise, which plays Dallas in Monday night's Hall of Fame 
exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was disappointment the first year, the second year and  
the third year when I got into the final six but didn't make it,'' 
he said. ``But to be going in at the same time those guys are going 
back on the field -- those orange helmets show up and football 
returns to the lakefront -- that makes it worth the wait.''

<HEADLINE> Scars of Columbine Shootings Erased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. -- When the bell rings to start the fall term at  
Columbine High School, there will be no physical trace of the 
deadly rampage last spring that left 15 dead and dozens injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullet holes have been patched, broken glass has been  
replaced and the library -- where most of the killings occurred -- 
has been hidden behind a new wall of lockers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want students to feel good about being back here,'' said  
Jack Swanzy, the director of planning for Jefferson County School 
District. ``If students can walk down these halls and not cringe 
... we feel we've been very successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was lunchtime on April 20 when seniors Dylan Klebold, 17, and  
Eric Harris, 18, walked into Columbine, setting off bombs and 
firing weapons. Twelve students and a teacher were killed before 
the gunmen committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	After the massacre, witnesses said the school resembled a war  
zone, with overturned furniture, backpacks scattered throughout the 
building and heavy damage to the cafeteria and library. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction crews have spent the summer inside the sprawling  
suburban high school, completing $1.2 million worth of renovations. 
</P>
<P>
	They've done everything from plastering bullet and shrapnel  
holes to replacing blood-stained carpets with linoleum and 
repainting gray walls blue, white and green. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking back at the Saturday after the shooting, I was in  
shock,'' Columbine Principal Frank DeAngelis said Friday. ``I was 
not sure what the future held for CHS. It's exciting that within 
two weeks Columbine will become a school again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Architects still haven't decided what to do with the library,  
which has remained closed since the shootings. For now, a new 
locker-lined wall covers the entrance. Some books have been 
destroyed because they were damaged by bullet holes and blood, 
Swanzy said, while the rest have been put in storage. 
</P>
<P>
	A trailer outside the school, complete with computers that have  
Internet access and about 1,000 books, will act as a temporary 
library until a more permanent solution is found. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of student-designed tiles have been put up along  
hallways, many of which are dedicated to classmates who died in the 
rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	There are new tables and chairs in the cafeteria, and purple  
carpeting in hallways has been replaced by gleaming white tile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it looks awesome,'' said Mike Sheehan, 17, the student  
body president. ``What's nice is that it's the same school, but 
still looks a little different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Security has also been enhanced. Sixteen video cameras have been  
added and students will have to wear identification tags. A 
card-swipe system has been set up to replace standard door locks 
for after-hours entry to the school.

<HEADLINE> Gov't 'Print and Delete' Policy OKd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agencies may purge records from  
computers once copies of the original documents are made, an 
appellate court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision Friday was the first major setback for the advocacy  
group Public Citizen in a records-preservation battle that began a 
decade ago with an effort to keep the White House from destroying 
records of the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  
District of Columbia Circuit overturned a lower court's ban on 
destruction of records. 
</P>
<P>
	Public Citizen sued John Carlin, archivist of the United States,  
and executive branch agencies in 1996 over Carlin's ruling the year 
before authorizing federal agencies to ``print and delete'' from 
government computers electronic mail or word processing records. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlin's position makes such orders applicable to all federal  
agencies. His order allowed paper, microfilm or electronic 
retrieval copying. 
</P>
<P>
	Public Citizen, with the American Library Association, the  
American Historical Association, the Organization of American 
Historians and other research groups, sued on grounds Carlin's 
order violated the U.S. Records Disposal Act and was ``arbitrary 
and capricious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court, in a decision written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg,  
ruled that the order did not violate the act, which gave Carlin 
wide discretion to set standards and methods for destroying 
documents. Judges Laurence Silberman and Stephen Williams joined in 
the opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, the court said, the plaintiffs did not question  
Carlin's right to order destruction of reproduced original computer 
records but argued that Carlin erred in not requiring electronic 
storage. Such retrieval systems are much easier for researchers and 
others to use than other forms of storage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus, therefore, is upon whether the archivist acted  
arbitrarily and capriciously in determining that a paper copy in a 
paper record-keeping system is an adequate substitute for the 
electronic original,'' the judges wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	They ruled that, although Carlin wrote in issuing his order of  
the benefits of electronic over paper record-keeping, his failure 
to order it was neither arbitrary nor capricious. 
</P>
<P>
	They quoted Carlin's reasoning in a document that accompanied  
the original order: 
</P>
<P>
	``Electronic record-keeping systems may be the best means to  
preserve the content, structure and context of electronic records. 
In addition, an automated system may be more easily searched and 
manipulated than paper records,'' Carlin wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he wrote, ``agencies must create and maintain records to  
conduct government business and account for their activities. Only 
the agency can determine what format best serves these purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public Citizen first challenged the routine destruction of  
electronic records in 1989. A court ordered the government not to 
push ahead with destruction of Iran-Contra e-mail and word 
processing files from the computers of Oliver North and other 
National Security Council officials. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the NSC's ``print and destroy'' policy that Carlin's 1995  
order sent throughout the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The appellate panel's ruling overturned a decision two years ago  
by U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman in which he voided Carlin's 
order and instructed him to come up with a permanent plan for 
handling electronic documents by last September. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Friedman's ruling, agencies have backed away from ``print  
and destroy,'' Michael Tankersley, Public Citizen's lead attorney 
in the Carlin case, wrote in paper posted on the group's Web site 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Department of Defense, one of the government's largest  
generators of computer records, has announced detailed plans to 
preserve and manage its electronic records in electronic format,'' 
Tankersley wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Other agencies also are guarding against premature destruction  
of electronic records, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	It was uncertain whether Public Citizen would appeal the loss.  
Tankersley did not immediately return a telephone call Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	His colleague in the case, Alan Morrison, told The Washington  
Post that a decision on a higher appeal had not been made.

<HEADLINE> Saints Already Nursing Wounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) -- New Orleans Saints coach Mike Ditka went  
into training camp saying he wanted his team to be tough and 
hard-hitting with a nasty attitude. He was referring to the games, 
though, not the practice field. 
</P>
<P>
	With their first exhibition game still almost a week away, the  
Saints on Saturday were already nursing wounds inflicted by another 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Keith Poole's nose was broken, his left eye was  
purple and swollen closed. It took six stitches to close cuts above 
and below it, inflicted Friday during a melee that culminated a day 
of brawls in two practice sessions with the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Poole said, and television footage appeared to confirm, that  
Chiefs free safety Jerome Woods hit him late. When Poole turned to 
confront Woods, Kansas City cornerback Chris Dishman grabbed Poole, 
pinned his arms back and stripped off Poole's helmet. A moment 
later, Chiefs cornerback Carlton Gray dove over Poole's back and 
hit him in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches separated the players and called off the rest of  
practice, but as the teams left the field, Poole challenged Gray, 
nearly touching off another brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I shouldn't have done it,'' Poole said Saturday. ``But it was  
a cheap shot and the guy knows it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scrimmage planned for Saturday morning was canceled.  
</P>
<P>
	Friday night, additional police were dispatched to the cafeteria  
where the teams ate dinner before the Saints returned to La Crosse. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there were no serious injuries from the fights, Ditka  
implied that Chiefs coaches encouraged their players to 
deliberately hurt people and his players had to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you going to tell your guys, `Just take what they give  
you. Let them hit you in the back, take their helmets off and swing 
them at you.''' Ditka said. ``That's bull. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tried to hit our top running back (Ricky Williams), when  
the play is over, and to have one of their coaches say, ``Take him 
out,' from what I understand. I don't know if I can say that for 
sure, but I heard that. That bothers me. Then again, I guess you 
consider the source.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka said one of his coaches told him the Chief's coaches were  
telling their players to take Williams out. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive lineman Kyle Turley also said it was a hit on Williams  
that set off the chain of events. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took a couple of cheap shots at Ricky, and that's not  
right,'' Turley said. ``No. 97 (Ty Parten) had some cheap shots on 
Ricky, he tackled him when he was in the middle of a pile. We 
started making plays on them, and they started taking people out. 
We were just defending ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiefs general manager Carl Peterson said no one was to blame,  
but Saints defensive line coach Walt Corey said Chiefs first-year 
coach Gunther Cunningham failed to control his team after fights 
erupted throughout the morning session. 
</P>
<P>
	``The person in charge over there is to blame,'' Corey said,  
indicating the Chiefs. ``Whoever's in charge is in total control. 
It was supposed to be a practice, not a fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham apparently tried to stop the fights. He loudly  
scolded his team after Kansas City tackle Marcus Spears used his 
helmet to hit Saints defensive end Brady Smith in the back of the 
head during one brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the players that we weren't going to play like this and  
it just kept escalating,'' said Cunningham, who sent Spears to the 
locker room after the incident. ``I tried to calm them down and we 
said if it didn't we were going to stop practice. I looked at Mike 
and he said he felt the same way, so we stopped.''

<P>
	Spears later apologized for his actions.  
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize to this organization and the team because you  
can't have that,'' he said. ``In the heat of battle, things are 
going on. But you've got to keep your composure and I lost my 
composure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka said he had not heard from the league and did not know if  
there would be any sanctions or investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our guys stuck together,'' Ditka said. ``I like that, and I  
can't stand up and be too critical of that, and I'm not going to be 
critical of them. What we did, we did in defense. I didn't think we 
precipitated any of it. That makes a difference. ... We were the 
guys that just reciprocated. Maybe we shouldn't have done that but 
we did. We fought back.''
