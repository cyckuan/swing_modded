   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- The new alliance between Lutherans and
Episcopalians isn't official until January, but two ministers in
Maine already are showing how crossover congregations can work.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. David Snyder is the first Lutheran minister to take on
an all-Episcopal congregation in New England. He's believed to be
the first in the country since this summer's interdenominational
accord, said the Rev. Ron Jackson, associate to the bishop of the
New England synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sun is rising over Maine,'' Jackson said. ''It's a cause
for rejoicing.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly four decades of talks, Episcopalians approved an
alliance in July that allows the churches to share clergy,
sacraments and programs. The pact was approved by the Lutherans
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Artificial barriers that have divided and separated Christians
for centuries are beginning to be slowly but surely dismantled,''
Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   A search committee at St. Peter's in Bridgton decided Snyder
would become the congregation's new spiritual leader in April, even
before the alliance was celebrated in July.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may be the only state in the country that has already moved
toward putting flesh on this new agreement,'' Snyder said of his
part-time ministry.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some crossover for years under a 1982 interim
Eucharistic agreement that allowed the two denominations to share
pastors in cases of shortages. Often that meant ministering to
mixed congregations of Lutherans and Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
   Without the new alliance, Snyder would have had to give up his
Lutheran identity and become an Episcopalian to minister to the
people of St. Peter's.
</P>
<P>
   The Lutheran religion dates back to the 1500s, when Martin
Luther rebelled against the Roman Catholic Church, triggering the
Protestant Reformation. The Episcopalians trace their roots to the
Anglican Church, which stretches back to Henry VIII of England and
his spurning of Catholic authority in the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   The movements established presences in America a century later,
but differences in culture and language posed a longtime barrier to
communication, Jackson said. Many Lutherans are of Scandinavian or
German ancestry, in contrast to the English background common to
many Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not bound by those language and cultural barriers
anymore, so it's a marvelous time for us to get together,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James Morgan, 53, a retired Episcopal military chaplain
who became part-time minister at a Lutheran church under the 1982
agreement, said the two denominations share as much as 95 percent
of their beliefs and practices.
</P>
<P>
   But there are subtle differences. For example, Lutheran
ministers are known as pastors; Episcopalians are ministered to by
priests. There was initial confusion in Bridgton about what to call
Snyder. Parishioners have since settled on ''Father Dave.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'Well, I have four children, I'm a father, so I'd feel
very comfortable if you call me 'father,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There also are some style differences. Lutherans tend to
improvise more than Episcopalians do when reading from the prayer
book, Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone came up to me, very gently, and said, 'As
Episcopalians, we like to use the words in the book,''' Snyder
recalled with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder sees his ministry as an opportunity to bring together
people of various Christian faiths. He's seen how it can work in
his capacity as executive director of the Habitat for Humanity of
Greater Portland, which brings people of different faiths together
on the common project of building affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we share in common is so much more important than the
differences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder's presence already is marked by unusual circumstances and
unity. St. Peter's doesn't have a church, so it uses space at
Bridgton's Methodist church. Snyder's ministry celebration was held
at a Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   Especially unusual is the fact that both the Episcopal and
Lutheran bishops overseeing the arrangement are women. Only eight
of the Episcopalians' 150 bishops are women, said the Rt. Rev.
Chilton Knudsen, the region's Episcopal bishop. Only three of the
65 Lutheran bishops are women, according to the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America
</P>
<P>
   ''The law of averages is way far extended,'' Knudsen said.
''It's too many wonderful things.''
</P>
<P>
   Knudsen was looking forward to brainstorming with the Lutheran
bishop and seeing how the alliance pans out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm rejoicing and giving thanks that the Holy Spirit seems to
have chosen this corner of the world for this,'' Knudsen said. ''At
one level, I'm not at all surprised it's happening here because we
do things the way we think we ought to here, in our Yankee
fair-mindedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatrice White, a 20-year member of St. Peter's and a member of
the search committee, said Snyder wasn't chosen as a maker of
religious history.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just think he's a spiritual man who will be able to lead us
well,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Lobbies UN for Recognition  </HEADLINE>
By FAIZA SALEH AMBAH
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Afghanistan's ousted government called
Thursday for increased sanctions against the Taliban at the same
time that the religious militia was lobbying the United Nations for
official recognition four years after taking control of most of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   A Taliban delegation headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Abdur
Rahman Zahid arrived in New York on Sunday for what aides said
would be the most concerted effort yet by the Taliban to gain
Afghanistan's U.N. seat.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan is now represented at the United Nations by the
government of ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani, whose alliance
controls less than 10 percent of the country.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference staged at the same time Rabbani's
government was addressing the General Assembly, Zahid told
reporters that he came to New York to inform the United Nations
that the Taliban had fulfilled all the conditions for the U.N.
seat.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to take that same message to Washington over the next
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why do they recognize a country that does not exist, that does
not have an address? On what grounds does the opposition have that
seat?'' Zahid asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as the conditions that have been set by the United
Nations, we have fulfilled them. We have the land, the population,
government and authority. We are waiting for the world to come to
that realization and do justice,'' Zahid said through an
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
recognize the Taliban government, which has imposed a rigid form of
Islamic law in the 90 percent of Afghanistan it controls. The
United States, Russia and other U.N. member states have opposed
Taliban representation at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright repeated
that the United States would oppose any shift in the U.N. seat to
the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   While some governments automatically recognize whoever controls
a country, ''we pick and choose,'' Albright told reporters in
Washington, citing the Taliban's human rights record and the fact
that it is a sanctuary for Saudi exile Osama bin Laden as reasons
for denying the Taliban a U.N. seat.
</P>
<P>
   The United States accuses bin Laden of masterminding the bombing
of two U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998. U.N. sanctions were
imposed on Afghanistan in November barring international flights to
or from Taliban territory.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the United States have threatened more -- a call
echoed by the ousted government in an address to the General
Assembly's ministerial debate.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Foreign Minister Abdullah, who uses only one name, said
that since the Taliban took over, ''it has been a reign of terror
imposed by religious police, and abuse in the name of religion,
elimination of all freedoms and civil liberties, massive violation
of human rights and degrading and tormenting treatment of men and
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan in 1979 and spent nearly a
decade battling Western-backed Islamic groups before withdrawing in
1989. Three years later, the Islamic groups overthrew the communist
regime in Kabul; the Taliban have since taken control of most of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Big 10 Presidents Back Myles Brand  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SUNDHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The presidents of the other Big Ten
universities are standing behind Indiana's Myles Brand on his
decision to fire basketball coach Bob Knight.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 other presidents, joined by the heads of three national
higher education associations, published a full-page announcement
in Friday's Chicago Tribune backing Brand's decision to dismiss
Knight and praising Indiana's trustees for supporting his
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Their announcement endorses ''the difficult but necessary
exercise of presidential authority'' in firing Knight.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy surrounding Knight's behavior had begun to
eclipse the university's academic mission, the presidents said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The exercise of presidential leadership to counter such
situations is critical. Even popular and successful coaches must
observe institutional chain of command and be bound by values and
policies of the institutions they serve,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   After Knight was fired Sept. 10, Brand and other administrators
were the targets of jeering and threats from the coach's defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's departure sparked campus protests that drew more than
2,000 students. Demonstrators burned effigies and knocked over
light poles outside the president's residence.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Brand and his wife, were driven from their campus
home. Peg Brand, a philosophy professor at the school, taught
classes with a police officer at her side.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the reaction to Knight's firing prompted
university leaders to make a public show of support for
presidential control of college athletics, said Stanley Ikenberry,
president of the American Council on Education and former president
of the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ''This statement is directed to presidents and boards nationally
and not confined to the public debate taking place in the State of
Indiana,'' Ikenberry said.
</P>
<P>
   Also signing the statement were heads of the Association of
American Universities and the National Association of State
Universities and Land-Grant Colleges.

<HEADLINE> To classmates, teen sanctioned by SEC was notable for carrying a briefcase </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR GROVE, N.J. (AP) - Aside from the briefcase and a
reputation for stock market savvy, 15-year-old Jonathan G. Lebed
did not get much notice from his classmates, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, that is, when they learned he had become the
youngest person sanctioned by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Cedar Grove High School classmate Nicole Basalyga, 16, said
teachers and students spent the day asking Lebed for stock tips.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McCarthy, 16, said he was a longtime friend of Lebed and
knew he was trading over the Internet, but ''he never told people
how much he was making.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To an extent, he's a normal kid, hanging out and stuff. But
this investment stuff, he keeps quiet,'' McCarthy said. Both are
juniors.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed says he has been fascinated by finance since he was 11. He
soon started trading, and by eighth grade, he and two friends were
among the finalists in CNBC's stock-picking contest.
</P>
<P>
   He became a ''very active'' trader, an SEC official said
Thursday, a day after the agency announced the boy would pay them
$285,000 to settle charges he profited by selling stocks he
promoted with baseless information.
</P>
<P>
   ''It intrigued me watching all the numbers go by on
television,'' the teen told The Wall Street Journal in Thursday's
editions.
</P>
<P>
   The teen operates two E-commerce companies: PR Host, which
serves as a home for business Web sites, and Promotion Solutions,
which sells e-mail addresses and provides advice on business
marketing, he told The Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site for PR Host boasts that the company is among the
''fastest-growing hosting companies on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a series of online trades while he was 14 that led
the SEC to charge him with illegal stock manipulation in 11
instances from Aug. 23, 1999, to Feb. 4, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said he was the first minor it has sued.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, Lebed agreed to repay $285,000, which the
SEC said represented illegal profits and interest. He neither
admitted nor denied the commission's findings, but agreed to
refrain from similar behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC alleged a ''pump and dump'' scheme: Lebed bought large
blocks of nine low-priced stocks, hyped them on Internet financial
message boards, watched the prices rise, and then sold - all within
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But those 11 trades are just a fraction of Lebed's activity,
said Joy Thompson, associate director of the SEC's Philadelphia
office, which handled the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We looked at thousands of trades. He was a very active trader.
These 11, we felt, were the strongest case, where he clearly
violated the anti-fraud provisions,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to speak to Lebed on Thursday were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   He left the school Thursday in the back seat of a car driven by
friends who cursed at reporters as they left.
</P>
<P>
   E-mails sent to Lebed via his Web-based companies did not get an
immediate reply.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Gregory Lebed, told reporters at the family's home,
''I'm proud of my son,'' but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Lebed told reporters on Wednesday he could not
comment on the SEC case, but spoke about how he got interested in
trading: watching CNBC at age 11.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, one of his earliest picks was America Online
because it was offering unlimited access, he told the Journal: ''I
bought shares of AOL at $25. The next day it was up a few points.''
He said he sold when it hit $30.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has urged Cedar Grove officials to get high-speed
Internet access in the township.
</P>
<P>
   A message left Thursday for the township manager was not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   For the future, he's considering attending culinary school while
continuing with his Internet businesses, The Star-Ledger said.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said the case demonstrates the risks of Internet
stock tips, especially in thinly traded issues.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed traded in custodial accounts in his father's name at two
brokers, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   The nine stocks in which he agreed to disgorge profits from 11
trades were traded on the NASD Over the Counter Electronic Bulletin
Board or the NASDAQ National Market: Manchester Equipment Co. Inc.,
Just Toys Inc., Yes Entertainment Inc., Fotoball USA Inc., Man Sang
Holdings Inc., West Coast Entertainment Inc., Havana Republic Inc.,
Classica Group Inc. and Firetector Inc., according to SEC
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC found that after Lebed bought a stock he sent hundreds
of identical, false e-mail messages, each under a fictitious name,
touting the stock he had just purchased.
</P>
<P>
   His profits on each trade ranged from more than $11,000 to
nearly $74,000, ultimately totaling $272,826. The $285,000
settlement reflects prejudgment interest of $12,174.

Firestone Says Ford Had Wrong Tire Pressure
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The tire pressure that Ford recommends for Explorers is
lower than what Bridgestone/Firestone suggests and makes the popular sport
utility vehicle less safe, a tire company executive told Congress Thursday. The
tire maker wrote Ford this week requesting it raise the recommended pressure
from 26 pounds per square inch (psi) to 30 pounds, Bridgestone/Firestone
executive vice president John Lampe told a House Commerce subcommittee.
Firestone tires, which have been linked to 101 U.S. traffic deaths, are standard
equipment on the Explorer, the world's best-selling sport utility vehicle.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Surviving World War II prisoners of war who allege they

lawsuits brought by about three dozen former POWs, U.S. District Court Judge
Vaughn Walker ruled that a 1951 peace agreement between the United States and
Japan bans such compensation claims. California became a magnet for such cases
last year when the legislature enacted a law allowing victims of slave labor to

<HEADLINE> Spanish Farmers: More Fuel Protests  </HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spanish farmers said Thursday they would
continue their blockades of distribution centers for a month after
the government refused to cut fuel taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's two top farming associations said they would continue
talks with the government but had no plans to call off protests
scheduled for the next month.
</P>
<P>
   That came after an overnight meeting in which the government
refused to budge from its refusal to cut taxes on fuel, but
reiterated its offer of income tax relief and soft loans for
farmers, fishermen and truckers.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank warned governments not to sacrifice
tax and spending plans and undermine economic growth to placate
protesters outraged by skyrocketing fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said in its monthly report that doing so would ''risk
endangering the continuation of the non-inflationary growth
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The fuel protests, which have paralyzed many highways, ports and
fuel depots this month as they move across the continent, began in
France and then spread to other EU nations, most recently, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   But while France bowed to some trucker demands and granted tax
rebates, Germany, Britain and Spain have refused to lower fuel
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is still serious and the Spanish government
position is very clear,'' Spain's Foreign Minister Josep Pique said
Thursday from Stockholm. ''There will be no ambiguous signals to
the market and the lowering of taxes is not foreseeable''
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, thousands of fishermen and farmers blocked several
highways and ports and surrounded fuel distribution centers,
continuing protests which began last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers with tractors and trucks blocked three regional fuel
distribution centers for a second day as some 20 fishing boats
launched a 24-hour blockade of the port of the eastern city of
Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   For average consumers, taxes in Spain account for roughly 58
percent of the price at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers between Spain and France got a break when some 250
fishermen who blocked the border crossing at La Junquera called off
their protest after three hours to express condemnation of the
shooting of a politician in Barcelona, a killing blamed on the
Basque separatist group ETA.
</P>
<P>
   Other fishermen and supporters are blocking delivery of fish and
seafood to the market at the eastern port of Valencia leading
officials to warn of fish price rises as a consequence.
</P>
<P>
   In Sweden, some 300 truckers called an end to their blockade of
ports in the southwestern city of Goeteborg in recognition of the
disruption they were causing.
</P>
<P>
   In Poland, the government suspended duties on all imported fuel
in an effort to ease rising prices and head off a big jump in
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Some fuel dealers said they doubted the move would mean lower
prices at the pump soon, however, because fuel sold by Polish
refineries which dominate the market already is cheaper than
imports.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, truckers met Thursday with the provincial government
of Ontario to try to avert a threatened protest over high fuel
prices. The truckers said they would decide Friday whether to hold
protests.

<HEADLINE> World War II Memorial Approved  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Planners approved a World War II memorial for
the National Mall on Thursday night, rejecting complaints that the
design was confusing and its siting would obstruct views of the
Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will allow the ground-breaking to begin and I'm delighted
with that,'' said Chairman Harvey B. Gantt of the National Capital
Planning Commission after the panel voted 7-5 to approve the
design.
</P>
<P>
   Two substitute motions were defeated that might have delayed the
ground-breaking, scheduled for Veterans Day, Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing 10 hours of testimony, the commission left open
the question of a central statue bearing a ''Light of Freedom,'' to
be placed in the middle of the Rainbow Pool until they could see a
design for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they don't get a design they like, they may not put
anything there at all,'' said Michael G. Conley, a spokesman for
the American Battle Monuments Commission. It also asked designers
to bring in a new lighting plan.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of minor structures including an information booth and
a comfort station were deferred until another meeting Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argued that the new memorial would obstruct the views of
the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument across the grassy
expanse of the National Mall. One of the chief critics, Rep.
Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's delegate to
Congress, called the design a ''confused set of half-baked
notions.''
</P>
<P>
   Countering her objections were former Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole and Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, both of whom were wounded
in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a good friend of Eleanor's but we just happen to have a
disagreement here,'' Dole said. ''We'll try to lay it out and let
the commission decide, and that's what World War II was all about --
so we could have freedom of expression and have different views.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole urged approval of the design so there could be a
groundbreaking on Veterans Day.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has dedicated a site between the Washington
Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. But opponents argue the new
memorial would interfere with the vista between the structures.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial would sit at the head of the Reflecting Pool in
front of the Lincoln Memorial, with 56 pillars and a pool
surrounding a sunken plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Two fountains would send jets of water, and wind sensors able to
reduce the flow would protect visitors from the spray. A wall of
gold stars would represent veterans killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who would history blame for the unspeakably confused set of
half-baked notions before you that pass for a memorial, while
displaying at once a warped sense of the nation's history and
marring the simple vow of our noble World War II veterans?'' Norton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole has led a campaign that has raised nearly $140 million for
the new monument. Another veteran who helped in that effort was
Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who was awarded the Medal of Honor for
bravery in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that Kerrey had once criticized the design, Dole said
he told the Nebraska senator, ''You know, Bob, I'm not the
architect. I agreed to help raise the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Architect Friedrich St. Florian said the monument's central
sculpture by Ray Kasky is ''a work of art still in progress'' and
he did not know when the design would be ready.
</P>
<P>
   He told the commission that it would be no more than 15 feet
high and would not interfere with views of either the Lincoln
Memorial or the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, plans were announced Thursday for an education center
aimed at adding context to the 58,220 names on the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters doubt legislation authorizing it will pass
Congress this term, in part because the World War II memorial and a
proposal to honor President Reagan may crowd it out.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., who lost three limbs in a grenade
blast, says he is frustrated by the delays in erecting memorials.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's part of our history, and it's a history we ought to
publicly acknowledge,'' Cleland said. ''When you reduce the
complexities of war down to an individual name, you realize an
individual American suffered for the country. Then when you see so
many, it's overwhelming.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Blasts OPEC, Gore Proposal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Ending a four-state campaign swing, Reform
Party presidential candidate Pat Buchanan on Thursday blasted OPEC
for the rising price of crude oil and criticized Al Gore for
proposing to tap into the nation's strategic oil stockpile to lower
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that (President) Clinton and (Vice President) Gore
have failed America and their failure is responsible for this
energy crisis,'' Buchanan said, ridiculing the Democratic
presidential nominee's proposal to oil reserves to drive down oil
prices before winter arrives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of breaking up Microsoft let's break up OPEC,''
Buchanan said, referring to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. ''They've got Europe by the throat, and here we are
begging this price-rigging, criminal conspiracy to help us'' and
increase oil production.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tell the Persian Gulf countries, if they want us to defend
them, 'Pump oil!'''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's stop in front of a Roman Catholic book and supply
store that serves as his Pittsburgh campaign headquarters put the
capper on a trip that also took him to Michigan, Ohio and South
Carolina since Monday. About 50 vocal supporters gathered to talk
to the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Green Party candidate Ralph Nader also criticized Gore's
proposal, calling it ''a ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The reserve was established for national security emergency
objectives, not for bailing out a politician whose long record of
receiving oil industry political money and caving in to Big Oil has
become an embarrassment during this election season,'' Nader said.

<HEADLINE> Eastwood Takes the Stand in ADA Case  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN BERGSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Clint Eastwood took the witness stand
Thursday to testify about what he knew about building codes when he
renovated a hotel that allegedly violated the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood, 70, is being sued by Diane zum Brunnen, who suffers
from muscular dystrophy and wants unspecified damages from the
actor-director because his Mission Ranch just outside Carmel was
not fully accessible to her wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood harshly criticized the case in a hearing before
Congress in May. In court, zum Brunnen's attorney, John Burris,
asked Eastwood whether he developed any expertise in construction
codes as mayor of Carmel from 1986 to 1988 and as a film director
who had sets built.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood said he delegated many of the specifics of the
renovation of Mission Ranch, a 150-year-old dairy farm he bought in
1987, to a contractor. He said he was familiar with the Americans
with Disabilities Act as it was being written a few years later and
similar California laws already on the books.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew there were some requirements but didn't know
specifically what they were,'' Eastwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Zum Brunnen, 51, sued Eastwood in 1997, claiming her rights were
violated when she and her husband had dinner at the hotel the year
before. Among their complaints: The wheelchair-accessible bathroom
for Mission Ranch's restaurant was more than 200 feet away, across
a driveway; the lone guest room for the disabled was $225, when
other rooms were as low as $85; and there was no ramp to the main
office.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood says he was not given a chance to improve disabled
access at Mission Ranch before he was sued.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from Burris, Eastwood acknowledged that a
wheelchair ramp could have been added to the office as far back as
1992, when other work was being done.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were so busy restoring and repairing the place,'' Eastwood
said, explaining why a ramp wasn't added. ''This is an ongoing
process and it's an ongoing process today.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood attorney Chuck Keller says the zum Brunnens cannot
prove they went to Mission Ranch on the day they claim. If they
did, the lawyer said, they were merely trying to find grounds for a
lawsuit. He said the couple also had filed a complaint against the
Heritage House hotel in Mendocino County.
</P>
<P>
   In zum Brunnen's time on the stand Thursday, Keller asked her to
explain inconsistencies in her testimony and pretrial depositions,
especially about the timing of a picture they say they took to show
the office did not have a ramp.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 disabled-rights activists protested outside the
courthouse as testimony began Wednesday, but Eastwood was greeted
Thursday instead by several autograph-seekers, whom he sheepishly
indulged.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood's celebrity was not lost on U.S. District Judge James
Ware, either. When Burris asked Eastwood to step off the stand to
show something on a map of Mission Ranch, Ware joked, ''This isn't
a disguised attempt to get his autograph, is it?''

<HEADLINE> News Anchor Settles Textbook Suit  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA K. BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The Society of Professional Journalists
has agreed to stop selling a journalism ethics textbook portraying
a Texas television anchor as an avid supporter of George W. Bush's
1994 gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement of the defamation lawsuit filed last year by Mike
Snyder of Dallas-Fort Worth TV station KXAS also calls for the
defendants to publish in their magazines and Web sites a statement
that the handbook contains ''significant factual errors that have
injured Mr. Snyder's reputation and caused him public
embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants -- Poynter Institute for Media Studies, Viacom
Inc., the Society of Professional Journalists and authors of
''Doing Ethics in Journalism'' -- also agreed to send the statement
to colleges using the book, to pay Snyder's attorney fees of more
than $17,000 and to remove Snyder's name from future editions of
the book.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way we could get them to admit what they did was to
take them to court and sue them,'' Snyder said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert D. Lystad, a lawyer for the defendants, said the lawsuit
was unnecessary because the authors apologized and offered to make
corrections immediately after realizing the errors.
</P>
<P>
   The correction statement is not yet posted on the journalism
society's Web site, but Lystad it would appear within 30 days of
the filing of the settlement, which was signed last week.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder is mentioned in a chapter titled ''Conflicts of
Interest'' about journalists who have been disciplined by their
employers for supporting politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The authors wrote that Snyder acted as a master of ceremonies
during 1994 rallies for Bush, who was running against Democrat Gov.
Ann Richards. The authors said Snyder often introduced Bush as
''the next governor of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   In the settlement, the authors acknowledge that Snyder never
worked for the Bush campaign and never introduced him at any event.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said he attended only one event, a 1994 Republican
women's picnic where Bush was the featured guest. But Snyder said
he only introduced House Majority Leader Dick Armey. After that,
the television station suspended Snyder without pay for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said the book researchers fabricated stories and quotes
to go with the story of his suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based upon my judgment, they had a scenario they wanted to
prove ... to show the dangers of a news anchor stepping over the
line,'' Snyder said. ''Instead of using an actual story, they went
and created a story.''
</P>
<P>
   In the settlement agreement, the authors said they attributed
quotes to Snyder that he never made and never interviewed Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   But Lystad said the authors -- Bob Steele, director of the ethics
program at the Poynter Institute, and professors John Black of the
University of South Florida and Ralph Barney of Brigham Young
University -- oppose calling it a fabrication because the mistakes
were unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was never a deliberate intent to write something
false,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Jews Reject Iranian's Offer  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iranian Jews living in the Los Angeles area
rejected an offer Thursday from Foreign Minister Kemal Kharrazi to
meet with them.
</P>
<P>
   Kharrazi had been granted permission by the State Department to
go to Los Angeles to meet with UCLA students and also with Iranian
Jews who live in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But Sam Kermanian, head of the nine-person Jewish delegation,
said the group decided to cancel the meeting after an appeals court
in Iran did not reverse the conviction of 10 Iranian Jews on
charges of cooperating with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she was ''very
disappointed'' by the court decision, which reduced the time the
Jews would spend in prison but upheld their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not think that due process existed either in the whole
way this was set up,'' Albright told reporters at the State
Department. ''So I think this is a disappointing decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright has tried to encourage moderation in Iran. A meeting by
the foreign minister with Jews who emigrated to the United States
appeared a step in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   But Kermanian said, ''We came to the conclusion it would send a
stronger message of protest'' to cancel the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current order in Iran is not prepared for any kind of
substantive talk with anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   American Jewish groups have told the State Department that 11
Jews who attempted to leave Iran over a number of years have
disappeared inside Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure coincided with a ruling by an appeals court in
Iran reducing the time 10 other Iranian Jews found guilty of
cooperating with Israel will be required to serve in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish groups provided the State Department this week with a
report of the disappearances. A department official said Thursday
the report was being examined.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 Jews, from Tehran, Shiraz and other Iranian cities, have
been missing for up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Their cause was taken up by Jewish leaders in a meeting Aug. 31
in New York with Mehdi Karrubi, speaker of the Iranian parliament.
It was the first such meeting since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Hoenlein, executive director of the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, was in the
meeting with Karrubi.
</P>
<P>
   Hoenlein said Thursday he had told him of reports that some of
the missing Jews had been seen by a Muslim prisoner in a jail near
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   ''We asked Mr. Karrubi to have the government of Iran look into
this and provide information,'' Hoenlein told a reporter. ''We have
gone to the U.S. government and they have been responsive to our
request that they help, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoenlein said, ''This is a tragedy that has dragged on for many
years and needs to be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Salai Meridor, head of the Jewish Agency,
took his concerns about the missing Jews to Sens. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., and Russ D. Feingold, D-Wis., and to a half-dozen members
of the House.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 missing Jews, according to information obtained by The
Associated Press, are:
</P>
<P>
   Babak Shaoulian-Tehrani, 23, of Tehran; Shahin Nik-Khoo, 25, of
Tehran; Salari Behzad, 27, of Kermanshah; Farad Ezati-Mahmoudi, 28,
of Kermanshah; Homayoun Bala-Zade, 47, of Shiraz; Omid Solouki, 23,
of Tehran; Rubin Kohan-Mosleh, 23, of Shiraz; Ibrahim Kohan-Mosleh,
22, of Shiraz; Syrous Ghahremani, 45 or 35, of Kermanshah; Ibrahim
Ghahremani, 64, of Kermanshah; and Nourollah Rabi-Zade, 55, of
Shiraz.

<HEADLINE> Japan Unmoved by Whale Kill Critics  </HEADLINE>
By GINNY PARKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Beer flowed and cheers went up Thursday as a ship
pulled into port carrying Japan's latest ocean catch -- 88 whales.
</P>
<P>
   The nation, which consumes whales both cooked and raw as a
delicacy, remains unabashedly defiant before growing international
criticism, defending the hunt as scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Japan plans to catch up to 160 whales -- and much of
the meat will end up in upscale restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ''All they think is that whales are cute,'' fisheries official
Masayuki Komatsu said derisively of Westerners at a ceremony aboard
the ship, the Nisshin Maru.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's hunt has drawn international ire. The United States
punished Japan last week by denying it some fishing rights in U.S.
waters and launched an investigation that could lead to trade
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese feel that consuming blubber is part of their
culture and are miffed about having outsiders meddle with their
eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   ''National dietary habits are products of history and should be
mutually respected,'' the Mainichi newspaper said in an editorial.
''The United States and those European states that have turned
against whaling used to slaughter whales for their oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese public has shown little interest in the whaling
controversy. TV news programs Thursday were devoted to coverage of
the Sydney Olympic Games and showed nothing on the whaling mission.
</P>
<P>
   The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling
in the mid-1980s but allows whaling countries to kill whales for
research to gather information on migration, eating patterns and
pollution levels.
</P>
<P>
   After pulling into a Tokyo harbor ending a monthlong mission,
the Nisshin Maru crew celebrated their return by lifting beer cans
in a joyous toast. Officials at the ceremony praised the ship's
crew and defended Japan's fight against international anti-whaling
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no reason to criticize the mission,'' crew member
Katsuo Nemoto said. ''This is biological science.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nisshin Maru and its fleet of research vessels brought back
in a refrigerated hull 88 whales caught and killed in the northwest
Pacific Ocean -- 43 Bryde's whales, five sperm whales and 40 minke
whales.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in more than a decade that the catch
included not just minke but also Bryde's and sperm whales -- two
species protected under U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo says both are plentiful, putting estimates at 100,000 for
sperm whales and 22,000 for Bryde's whales.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt is in no way endangering the species, fisheries
officials say, adding that the whales are hurting the livelihoods
of Japanese fishermen by eating too much fish.
</P>
<P>
   Activists say the research is no more than a guise for
satisfying Japan's taste for whale meat.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're simply trying to revive commercial whaling,'' said
Sanae Shida of Greenpeace Japan. ''Do you normally have to kill
animals to do this kind of research?''
</P>
<P>
   Kazuo Shima, an official with the government-linked Institute of
Cetacean Research, said Japan's efforts benefit the entire world.
</P>
<P>
   ''This research is not just for Japan,'' he said. ''If Japan
doesn't do this research, who will?''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Bring Tech To Disabled  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- President Clinton got a close-up
demonstration Thursday of technology that's helping people with
disabilities connect to cyberspace: computers that let people read
books online in Braille, send e-mails with a gaze of their eyes or
translate Web pages aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew to Michigan, a battleground state in the
presidential election, to announce actions that his administration,
private companies, universities and organizations are taking to
make sure more of the millions of Americans with disabilities can
join the digital economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not given every American the chance first to get an
education, and second to use their education to work and achieve
the American dream,'' Clinton said at Mott Community College after
touring a center that trains people with disabilities to use new
tools to access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this information age, when the pace of change increasingly
accelerates at a breathtaking rate, we cannot achieve that goal if
we leave any Americans stranded on the other side of the now-famous
digital divide.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said 17.3 million Americans have severe
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   At the Disability Network, a nonprofit technology center for the
disabled, Clinton tried to operate Eye Gaze, a system that tracks
users' eye movements to allow them to control their computers. He
had a little trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton focused his eyes on grids, letters and symbols on the
multicolored screen, but kept moving his head, instead of his eyes.
Nancy Cleveland, medical and technology coordinator of the system,
held the president's head between her hands to stabilize it, and he
did better.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty hard, but if you learn, you can get it down,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton walked into the campus event on the arm of Karla Hudson,
a 29-year-old rehabilitation counselor who lost her sight as a
child. Clinton observed a demonstration of a blind user typing on a
computer keyboard that orally repeated every command, letter and
punctuation mark she typed. Then, he sat down and typed: ''I would
like to have this everywhere.'' Onlookers applauded.
</P>
<P>
   At the community college, Clinton announced a series of actions
that will be taken to give people with disabilities access to new
technology. He said he has directed the Cabinet to find ways to
allow Medicare and Medicaid pay for technology to enable people
with disabilities live and work independently. Also, AmeriCorps is
awarding $9 million in grants to put 1,200 volunteers in schools
and communities to teach computer skills to students with
disabilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Clinton on Thursday, the executive officers of
more than 45 companies, including Microsoft, America Online,
BellSouth, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems, said within six
months they would train employees to develop products that give
disabled people better access to the digital world.
</P>
<P>
   In another letter, presidents of 25 research universities
pledged to ensure that computer scientists and engineers are
trained on making computers that can be more easily used by
disabled people. They also agreed to make sure their own
university's online resources are accessible to people with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Washington, Clinton urged Congress to pass a bill
that would provide $3 billion a year for 15 years to buy land,
restore coastlines and protect wildlife. The money would come from
oil and gas leases, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska.
The measure has stalled in the Senate. Some budget writers don't
want to lock in spending for 15 years, and some Republicans don't
want the government to buy more land in the West.
</P>
<P>
   While in Michigan, the president spoke to about 800 people at a
reception that raised an estimated $350,000 for the Democratic
Party in Michigan. At the event, in Livonia, he was joined by Rep.
Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., who is challenging Republican incumbent
Sen. Spence Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   He also addressed the State Bar of Michigan's 65 annual
reception in Detroit, where he complained that 42 of his
nominations to fill vacancies on the federal bench have been
stalled in the Senate. Thirty-four of the nominees have never had a
hearing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In an election year, there has always been some slowdown. But
if you look at the statistics here over the last five years, this
Senate has been far less forthcoming on these nominees than the
Democratic senators were with Republican presidents who were my
predecessors,'' Clinton said. ''These people are very highly
qualified, which leads to only conclusion -- that the process has
been politicized.''

   The freshman rallied the undefeated Wolfpack again, throwing
three touchdown passes to Koren Robinson in a 30-23 overtime
victory over Georgia Tech on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's as tough of an 18-year-old quarterback that I've ever
been around that has had to go out and perform,'' Wolfpack coach
Chuck Amato said. ''Just think what this youngster can do, not only
for this year, but for this program for the next four years to help
us get somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The comeback by Rivers was the third in four games as the
Wolfpack won their Atlantic Coast Conference opener and improved to
4-0 for the first time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no question there was a belief they thought they
could do it,'' Amato said of his team, which beat Arkansas State in
overtime in its home opener. ''This is something that is kind of
hard for me to say, but I'm speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers hit Robinson from 23 yards out in the right corner of the
end zone on the second play of OT. Robinson's reception gave him
122 yards -- the ninth time in his last 10 game he's gone over 100
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've talked to him about great players making great plays,''
Amato said of Robinson, last year's ACC rookie of the year. ''He
has done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech (2-2, 0-2) failed on its final chance when Kerry
Watkins, who scored the game-tying touchdown moments earlier,
couldn't haul in George Godsey's pass at the 5.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a perfectly catchable ball,'' Watkins said. ''That's
all on me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we gave them a gift,'' added Georgia Tech coach
George O'Leary. ''We dropped too many passes and had too many lost
opportunities in the red zone. We have to learn how to play
smart.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Wolfpack fans stormed the field and tore down
the goal posts.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers, who threw for only 87 yards in the opening 30 minutes,
hit Robinson on a fade route from 6 yards out with 12:13 left to
start the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Holt, the younger brother of St. Louis Rams receiver
Torry Holt, intercepted Godsey's pass deep in Wolfpack territory
and his 34-yard return set up Kent Passingham's 34-yard field goal
with 4:51 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Godsey's interception was his first in 122 attempts dating to
last season.
</P>
<P>
   However, a 50-yard kickoff return by Kelly Campbell gave the
Yellow Jackets excellent field position, and Godsey connected on a
fourth-down TD pass to Watkins to tie it with 1:20 left, setting
the stage for N.C. State's second OT win this season.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers, second in the nation in total offense, was 21-for-36 for
262 yards and two interceptions. He also took a beating, getting
sacked seven times.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack closed the gap to 13-7 in the third quarter after
the teams combined for three turnovers in five plays. Levar Fisher
recovered a fumble at the Georgia Tech 43 -- and less than a minute
after Rivers threw an interception -- Fisher caused a fumble that
resulted in J.J. Washington's 1-yard TD return.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack tied it less than six minutes later when Rivers
escaped a sure sack and threw a short pass to Robinson, who ran 48
yards as Rivers celebrated at midfield.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State's lead was short-lived though. Luke Manget kicked a
39-yarder late in the third for his third field goal of the game as
the Yellow Jackets regained the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Burns' 31-yard scoring run early in the first quarter, and
Manget's field goals of 50 and 43 yards staked the Yellow Jackets
to their first-half lead.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech had won five straight against N.C. State.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just a beautiful win,'' Fisher said.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Protests Taking of Cuban Plane  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- The Cuban government called Thursday for a mass
mobilization next week to protest American immigration policies it
blames for this week's commandeering of a state-owned plane to fly
a group of people out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came at the end of an evening public affairs
program examining the Tuesday flight of a crop-duster plane out of
Cuba by a pilot who stopped to pick up his family and friends
before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans will gather at 9 a.m. Monday to express ''their most
energetic protest'' at the plaza constructed outside the U.S.
Interests Section during the national campaign to repatriate
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, a moderator on the program said, reading
a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had feared that controversy over Tuesday's
flight would disrupt U.S.-Cuba migration talks set for Thursday,
but the session was held in New York as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ''And to that extent, I could say we got as much out of these
talks today as we realistically thought we would -- or could --
get,'' said U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State William
Brownfield in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He said the two sides said they were committed to end the
organized criminal smuggling of Cubans to the United States, but
they remained at odds over other migration issues -- including the
separation of families.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government, however, said in its announcement that
''absolutely nothing'' had come out of the session. ''So no other
alternative remains except to battle without truce against the
brutal and murderous (Cuban Adjustment Act), which everyday draws a
bit more Cuban blood,'' the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   It blasted what it called ''the continued cynical policies of
the government of the United States to continue promoting and
stimulating illegal departures'' of U.S.-bound Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba says the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act encourages its citizens
to undertake risky journeys to the United States because the law
allows any Cuban who reaches American soil to apply for U.S.
residency. Most Cubans picked up at sea are repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   Washington accuses Havana of provoking the risky journeys by
preventing Cubans who have U.S. visas from legally leaving the
island. Cuban officials deny the charge.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening communique, the government also complained that
American authorities ''have not even moved a finger'' to break up
U.S.-based smuggling rings that charge Cubans thousands of dollars
to be transported to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, being held at a New York office, were led by
Brownfield and Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National
Assembly and a confidant of President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The most important item on the U.S. agenda was raised three
weeks ago when the State Department officially protested that
President Fidel Castro's government was preventing Cubans who have
U.S. visas from legally leaving the island. As a result, would-be
immigrants had to attempt high-risk escapes by boat or plane.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our point to them ... is if you close the route of legal
migration to a bloc or a group of people, you are merely
encouraging them to find alternative ways to depart,'' Brownfield
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unknown if Cuba intended to launch a new round of
rallies, marches and other gatherings such as those that absorbed
the nation during the seven-month campaign to repatriate Elian, who
returned to Cuba in late June following a protracted custody
battle.
</P>
<P>
   The crop duster at the center of the current dispute crashed
Tuesday in the southern Gulf of Mexico about 50 miles west of Cuba,
killing one of the 10 people on board. The others were rescued by a
merchant ship and taken to Key West, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Ex-judge Testifies in Court Crisis  </HEADLINE>
By NORMA LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A former Supreme Court judge testified
Thursday that the chief justice was a trusted friend, contradicting
earlier testimony that he held such a strong grudge against Chief
Justice David Brock that he threatened to bring down the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were in a foxhole ... If the chief justice was the
(commanding officer) and he said 'fix bayonets and go up the hill,'
I'd do it,'' the ex-justice, Stephen Thayer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Brock's lawyers say the impeachment case against him depends
heavily on Thayer.
</P>
<P>
   ''You may question if I'm vindictive, but no one has ever
accused me of being stupid,'' said Thayer, who testified under a
grant of immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate is considering four charges in Brock's
unprecedented trial: that he routinely allowed judges to
participate in cases from which they were disqualified, lied to
House investigators, made an improper phone call to a lower-court
judge in 1987, and solicited Thayer's comments on judges appointed
to hear an appeal of Thayer's divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sherman Horton testified Wednesday he warned Brock to
watch out for Thayer after Thayer's Feb. 4 outburst objecting to a
judge appointed to the panel hearing the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Horton said Thayer was capable of being vindictive and blamed
Brock and retired Justice William Johnson for not supporting his
application to a federal position a decade ago. But Thayer said he
was glad he didn't get the job because he started a rewarding
teaching career.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the time I was upset my colleagues were not more laudatory.
As time went on, I realized it was the best thing that happened to
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer supported the prosecution's case on all four charges, but
his key testimony focused on the Feb. 4 incident. He said Brock
invited reaction when he announced his selections for the appeals
panel and spoke further with him about the panel in a private,
hallway conversation.
</P>
<P>
   In the conference room, ''He looked at me ... and said something
like 'What do you think about that?' or 'Is there a problem?'''
Thayer said.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer said Brock sent him out of the room but later joined him
in the hallway, where he told him the judge he had objected to
would serve on the panel and asked him whether he had problems with
two others.
</P>
<P>
   ''It happened very quickly,'' Thayer said.
</P>
<P>
   Brock denies the conversation ever happened. Justice John
Broderick testified Thursday he remembers Thayer peeking into the
room and asking if he could return, but Thayer said that wasn't
true.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was sent into the hallway I was staying there until
someone came and got me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brock's lawyer, Michael Madigan, emphasized it was Thayer who
was out of line, not Brock.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you think it he thought it was inappropriate for you to be
the room making comments about your own divorce?'' he said. ''Don't
you think it was strange the chief justice asked you to leave?''
</P>
<P>
   Thayer said he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't forget, he asked me to respond, and I shouldn't have.
Why are you suggesting he would in one instance request me to
respond and when I responded, tell me I did something wrong?'' he
said. ''I had no feeling I was being sent to the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, court Clerk Howard Zibel decided to report
Thayer's outburst and Brock's reaction to it. After learning of
Zibel's plans, the court filed its own report with a committee that
disciplines judges. Brock later reported Thayer to the attorney
general's office, triggering an investigation that led to Thayer's
resignation in March.
</P>
<P>
   Brock, a judge since 1976, has been on the high court since 1981
and chief justice since 1986. Fifteen of the 22 senators
participating would have to vote to convict him.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Hostages Soon Free  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine troops located the area on a
remote island where Muslim rebels were believed to be holding an
American hostage and moved in on the site Thursday, a presidential
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The jungle assault on the separatist Abu Sayyaf rebels on the
southern island of Jolo began in the afternoon, and Ricardo Puno
said military officials believe ''there are hopeful and promising
signs that they may be able to get something accomplished in the
very, very near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Schilling, from Oakland, Calif., was among 19 hostages
the Abu Sayyaf held on the run across Jolo last weekend after the
military began a major mission to rescue the captives.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a radio station broadcast the first interview with
Schilling since the rescue assault began Saturday. In the
interview, conducted by satellite telephone, he appealed to the
Philippine government to halt the mission and resume negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still alive,'' Jeffrey Schilling said. ''I'm fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview, conducted by the Radio Mindanao Network, was the
first confirmation that Schilling was alive. In it, he said many
civilians were being hurt by the assault, creating more support for
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am appealing to negotiators to talk to the U.S. government
and have the operations immediately ceased, the negotiations
continue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a second interview on Friday, Schilling said the military
operation has forced the rebels to flee, taking the hostages with
them through the jungle. ''That's really been tiring to walk most
of the day and night to avoid the military,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials believed Schilling was being controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Mr. Sabaya was telling him what to say and Mr. Sabaya
was using him for his own propaganda efforts,'' said Puno, the
presidential spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Schilling's mother, Carol, said she was relieved
he was alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very worried about his safety right now,'' she said. ''I
hope that he is released soon.''
</P>
<P>
   A faction of the Abu Sayyaf grabbed Schilling, a Muslim convert,
three weeks ago when he visited a rebel camp with his Filipino wife
and reportedly angered rebel leaders during an argument about
religion and politics.
</P>
<P>
   A separate faction led by Ghalib ''Robot'' Andang is believed to
be holding 16 other hostages, although a Cabinet official admitted
Thursday that the military has lost track of three Malaysian
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Two French journalists escaped from the rebels Tuesday night,
leaving Schilling, the three Malaysians and 13 Filipinos still in
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel spokesman Abu Sabaya, speaking in the same interview as
Schilling, acknowledged that four of his men had been killed and
said the rebels were open to negotiations with the Philippine and
U.S. governments.
</P>
<P>
   Using their satellite phone, the rebels have sought Libya's help
in restarting negotiations, a Cabinet official said. But the
military is not likely to be interested, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The military announced Thursday that 18 rebels were confirmed
dead and 42 others were reported dead but had not been confirmed.
Six government troops were injured in the six days of fighting, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   Four civilians who were earlier reported dead were actually only
injured, military spokesman Gen. Generoso Senga said. However,
wounded civilians interviewed at Jolo's hospital said they
personally witnessed the deaths of at least three other villagers
shot by the military.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada said Wednesday he would order a halt to
the attack if all the hostages are freed.
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed the escape of the two French journalists as
vindication of his decision to use force against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The attack had been strongly criticized by French President
Jacques Chirac, who said it could endanger the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The two journalists-- Jean-Jacques Le Garrec and Roland Madura of
France-2 television -- headed home Wednesday after crediting their
nighttime escape to the army assault.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in France, however, they criticized the government's
handling of the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's impossible to imagine a military operation that could
have gotten us out of there,'' Le Garrec said. He called the
military assault ''a criminal operation'' that was endangering the
island's innocent civilians and legitimizing the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were seized July 9 while visiting a rebel camp to
interview other hostages.

<HEADLINE> Slain Cameraman Honored at Mass  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Friends, family and colleagues gathered Thursday
for a simple memorial Mass for Associated Press Television News
cameraman Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora, slain four months earlier in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Miguel had done on earth what God wanted him to do, and he did
it very well,'' the Rev. Robert Farrell, the presiding priest, told
about 150 people assembled at St. James's Church in London.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest of several memorials honoring Gil Moreno de
Mora, who died along with Kurt Schork, a correspondent for the
Reuters news agency, in a May 24 rebel ambush while covering the
civil war in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues traveled from all over the world to attend Gil Moreno
de Mora's funeral in his hometown of Vimbodi, in eastern Spain.
Another memorial was held in July in Sarajevo, scene of only one of
the many violent and dangerous conflicts he had covered.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian government awarded posthumous citizenship to Gil
Moreno de Mora and Schork to honor them for their work.
</P>
<P>
   At the London Mass, Farrell, who was a friend of Gil Moreno de
Mora, said he believed the 32-year-old Spaniard ''was convinced he
was called to holiness of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He had no doubt that how he carried out his professional work
had a lot to do with that holiness,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Former Olympic 5,000-meter champion
Dieter Baumann lost a last-ditch effort to lift his drug suspension
in time to run in the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Arbitration for Sport, which convened in Sydney to
hear cases involving the Olympics, dismissed the German's appeal on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An International Amateur Athletic Federation arbitration panel
ruled on Monday that Baumann will be suspended from competition for
two years for twice testing positive for the anabolic steroid
nandrolone. The IAAF ruling council refused to reconsider the
penalty on Tuesday. The IAAF is the governing body for track and
field.
</P>
<P>
   Baumann, who was the gold medalist in the 1992 Barcelona Games,
had contended that the IAAF panel's ruling ''is ineffective with
regard to the Olympic Games and does not affect the athlete's
admission to the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Baumann has been outspoken in his criticism of those who use
performance-enhancing drugs. He contends that someone spiked his
toothpaste.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Softball On Losing Streak  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKTOWN, Australia (AP) -- Lisa Fernandez finally snapped her
0-for-the-Olympics slump.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States finally won another game.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez singled to lead off the fifth inning as the defending
gold medalists beat New Zealand 2-0 on Friday (Thursday night EDT)
to move one victory away from the medal round.
</P>
<P>
   The win came one day after Fernandez suggested that her
teammates stage a cleansing ceremony to remove a ''voodoo curse''
that was behind the team's unprecedented three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just got all the bad stuff off,'' she said. ''The voodoo's
gone. We're ready to rock and roll.''
</P>
<P>
   With no hits in her first 20 at-bats and a loss in the team's
game against Australia, Fernandez said her Olympic experience had
been a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse: it was a recurring one.
</P>
<P>
   In a game reminiscent of her loss in the 1996 Games, the star
U.S. pitcher cruised through a scoreless game and into extra
innings against Australia on Thursday -- then gave up a two-run
homer to lose 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sitting in the locker room thinking, 'It can't happen
again,''' Fernandez said. ''But one thing about Atlanta is, we won
the gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's defeat was the Americans' third straight loss in
Sydney, a stunning string for a team that had won 112 in a row and
was heavily favored in these Olympics. The United States had never
lost three straight international games, but it has now lost as
many games in these Olympics as it had since the last ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like this voodoo that's over us,'' said Christie Ambrosi,
who singled in the top of the 13th to give the United States a
short-lived lead. ''But it's got to end sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   It did on Friday (Thursday night EDT), when the Americans beat
New Zealand 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago in Atlanta, Fernandez had a perfect game through
nine innings of a scoreless game before the United States scored in
the top of the 10th. She got the first two outs in the bottom of
the inning, then gave up a two-run homer to Australia's Joanne
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Americans' only loss of the inaugural Olympic
softball tournament. Fernandez sobbed after the game, and she
stewed over it for the past four years while waiting for an
opportunity to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   She had her chance on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez struck out an Olympic record 25 batters and allowed
only one hit into the 13th. She retired the first batter, and then
got Brown to ground out to leave the Americans one out from a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fernandez threw a ''drop pitch'' that didn't drop, and Peta
Edebone knocked it over the left-field fence. The ending brought
both teams to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can now understand the emotions Joey went through in 1996,''
Edebone said. ''It's a feeling that takes over you. When I rounded
third and I looked at my teammates at home plate all crying, I
burst into tears.''
</P>
<P>
   The memories of the 1996 game and the burgeoning rivalry between
the teams -- from the '96 Games until these, Australia was the only
team to beat the Americans -- made Thursday's matchup a crucial one
for both sides. But the game became increasingly important when
both lost to Japan -- and then the Americans lost to China, which
played Australia Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The top four in the eight-team tournament advance to the medal
round. The third and fourth place teams would have to win an extra
game to win the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost to the top three teams in the standings, the
Americans are likely headed for fourth. They will have to beat
non-contenders New Zealand and Italy in the round robin and then
win three straight in the medal round to win the gold.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I've ever been a part of a bigger challenge than
we're in right now,'' Fernandez said. ''If we come back and win the
gold, there will be no sweeter win.''
</P>
<P>
   That will happen only if the Americans start hitting. They were
batting .181 heading into the New Zealand game, with Fernandez
still looking for her first hit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost like the Olympics isn't real,'' she said. ''I'm
0-for-whatever at the plate, and I was already nervous coming in
because of the expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want someone to pinch me and wake me from this nightmare.''

<HEADLINE> Cuba 1, Australia 0 in Baseball  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Cuban baseball team made sure its
first Olympic loss didn't turn into a losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans bounced back from their first-ever defeat by beating
host Australia 1-0 Friday (Thursday night) behind their best
big-game pitcher, Jose Ariel Contreras.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Ulacia singled home a run in the third inning and Contreras
allowed only three singles in a complete game that made the Cubans
winners again.
</P>
<P>
   The main question was how Cuba (4-1) would respond to its first
Olympic loss, 4-2 to the Netherlands on Wednesday. The Cubans
showed little emotion as they walked off the field that day after
their 21-game winning streak was ended.
</P>
<P>
   They wore their all-red uniforms -- the ones that earned them
recognition as the ''Big Red Machine'' of amateur baseball in the
'90s -- but were again subdued as they pulled out a close game
against Australia (2-3).
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans managed only one run in 7 2-3 innings off Shane
Bennett, and needed some help getting it. Right fielder Glenn
Reeves got a slow start on Miguel Caldes' slicing drive and had to
lunge for it. The ball popped out of his glove when he hit the
ground hard, resulting in a double, and Ulacia singled sharply to
right for the run.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras took it from there, striking out 10 with a sharp
breaking ball and a fastball that registered 97 mph on the
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras, one of 12 players on the Cuban roster who got gold
medals in Atlanta four years ago, pitched two vital games in the
Pan American Games last year. He beat the Dominican Republic and,
on one day's rest, shut down the United States in a 5-1 win for the
Pan Am championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans will play the Americans on Friday night in the
second-to-last game of the Olympic round-robin. Both teams are in
line to advance to the medal round, where they could meet again.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba won the gold in both Barcelona and Atlanta, undefeated and
rarely challenged. It brought back the core of that team to try for
a third.
</P>
<P>
   Known for pumping their fists and tossing their bats after each
big hit, the Cubans were subdued in their loss to the Dutch and
again in the close win over Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The only in-our-face gesture came from Ulacia, who caught a fly
on the warning track in left field in the fourth and posed with his
glove up for a few seconds after the catch, sending a murmur
through the crowd of 14,036.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Servio Borges got his bullpen going in the fourth, when
Dave Nilsson walked with two outs and Clayton Byrne singled sharply
through the hole at short for Australia's first hit.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras struck out free-swinging Paul Gonzalez -- he went down
on strikes four times -- to end the Australians' best threat.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 12, Pirates 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The season is winding down too soon for Marquis
Grissom.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom went 4-for-4 with a home run and Geoff Jenkins homered
for the third straight game as the Milwaukee Brewers routed the
Pittsburgh Pirates 12-2 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Confidence, that's all it is,'' said Grissom, who has had a
subpar season but raised his average to .248 with his perfect
night. ''I'm just trying to end strong, trying to build for next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, who also connected Tuesday and Wednesday against the
Chicago Cubs, hit his 32nd homer of the season, a three-run shot in
the seventh, to wrap up the scoring in a 14-hit Brewers attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''Home runs kind of come in spurts,'' Jenkins said. ''You just
try to get a pitch in your zone and hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 1-0, the Brewers made it easy for starter
Paul Rigdon (4-4) by scoring nine runs over the next five innings.
Rigdon allowed two runs and five hits in seven innings. He struck
out four and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't about my performance tonight,'' Rigdon said. ''The
team played great behind me and it makes it a lot easier when they
score 12 runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates took a 1-0 lead on Kevin Young's sacrifice fly in
the first inning after loading the bases with one out on two
singles and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't have excuses for getting off to a start like that,''
Rigdon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers answered with two in the second against Jimmy
Anderson (5-10). Jeromy Burnitz tied it with his 28th homer and
Kevin Brown added an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee took a 5-1 lead in the third as Jenkins had an RBI
double and Richie Sexson had a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers added two in a sloppily-played fourth inning. Brown
reached when second baseman Warren Morris dropped his high popup
for an error and the Brewers loaded the bases on a fielder's choice
on Rigdon's bunt and a walk to Grissom. Mark Loretta hit a
potential double play grounder to shortstop, but the throw pulled
first baseman Kevin Young off the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Young insisted he had tagged Loretta, but umpire Eric Cooper
ruled him safe, saying the tag was too late. Young was ejected and
then had to be restrained after a heated argument. When play
resumed, Brian O'Connor's wild pitch allowed Rigdon to score.
</P>
<P>
   ''The umpire evidently said something that set Kevin off,''
Pittsburgh manager Gene Lamont said, ''because I've never seen
Kevin like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said, ''There wasn't any doubt that I tagged him. That
wasn't the right call. I told him that was two calls that he
missed. Sometimes even good umps miss calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Grissom's 13th homer of the season in the fifth made it 9-1.
</P>
<P>
   John Vander Wal hit his 23rd home run leading off the sixth for
Pittsburgh. Jenkins' three-run shot in the seventh finished the
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't play great defensively,'' Lamont said, ''but we
didn't pitch very good, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers, playing their final homestand, have won four
straight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll try to put a string together for the remaining six
games,'' Milwaukee manager Davey Lopes said.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Both teams started the series coming off three-game sweeps,
the Pirates over the Phillies in Philadelphia and the Brewers at
home over the Cubs. ... Pittsburgh CF Adrian Brown had a 10-game
hitting streak stopped. His soft liner in the fifth was caught by
Rigdon on the fly with his pitching hand. ... Pittsburgh
pinch-hitters were 0-for-2 Thursday after going 9-for-13 in their
previous seven games. ... Burnitz drew his 91st walk to tie his
Brewers team record for a single season in the NL.

<HEADLINE> Softball: U.S. Snaps Losing Streak  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKTOWN, Australia (AP) -- Lisa Fernandez finally snapped her
0-for-the-Olympics slump.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States finally won another game.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez singled to lead off the fifth inning as the defending
gold medalists beat New Zealand 2-0 on Friday (Thursday night EDT)
to move one victory away from the medal round.
</P>
<P>
   The win came one day after Fernandez suggested that her
teammates stage a cleansing ceremony to remove a ''voodoo curse''
that was behind the team's unprecedented three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just got all the bad stuff off,'' she said. ''The voodoo's
gone. We're ready to rock and roll.''
</P>
<P>
   With no hits in her first 20 at-bats and a loss in the team's
game against Australia, Fernandez said her Olympic experience had
been a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse: it was a recurring one.
</P>
<P>
   In a game reminiscent of her loss in the 1996 Games, the star
U.S. pitcher cruised through a scoreless game and into extra
innings against Australia on Thursday -- then gave up a two-run
homer to lose 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sitting in the locker room thinking, 'It can't happen
again,''' Fernandez said. ''But one thing about Atlanta is, we won
the gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's defeat was the Americans' third straight loss in
Sydney, a stunning string for a team that had won 112 in a row and
was heavily favored in these Olympics. The United States had never
lost three straight international games, but it has now lost as
many games in these Olympics as it had since the last ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like this voodoo that's over us,'' said Christie Ambrosi,
who singled in the top of the 13th to give the United States a
short-lived lead. ''But it's got to end sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   It did on Friday (Thursday night EDT), when the Americans beat
New Zealand 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago in Atlanta, Fernandez had a perfect game through
nine innings of a scoreless game before the United States scored in
the top of the 10th. She got the first two outs in the bottom of
the inning, then gave up a two-run homer to Australia's Joanne
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Americans' only loss of the inaugural Olympic
softball tournament. Fernandez sobbed after the game, and she
stewed over it for the past four years while waiting for an
opportunity to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   She had her chance on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez struck out an Olympic record 25 batters and allowed
only one hit into the 13th. She retired the first batter, and then
got Brown to ground out to leave the Americans one out from a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fernandez threw a ''drop pitch'' that didn't drop, and Peta
Edebone knocked it over the left-field fence. The ending brought
both teams to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can now understand the emotions Joey went through in 1996,''
Edebone said. ''It's a feeling that takes over you. When I rounded
third and I looked at my teammates at home plate all crying, I
burst into tears.''
</P>
<P>
   The memories of the 1996 game and the burgeoning rivalry between
the teams -- from the '96 Games until these, Australia was the only
team to beat the Americans -- made Thursday's matchup a crucial one
for both sides. But the game became increasingly important when
both lost to Japan -- and then the Americans lost to China, which
played Australia Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The top four in the eight-team tournament advance to the medal
round. The third and fourth place teams would have to win an extra
game to win the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost to the top three teams in the standings, the
Americans are likely headed for fourth. They will have to beat
non-contenders New Zealand and Italy in the round robin and then
win three straight in the medal round to win the gold.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I've ever been a part of a bigger challenge than
we're in right now,'' Fernandez said. ''If we come back and win the
gold, there will be no sweeter win.''
</P>
<P>
   That will happen only if the Americans start hitting. They were
batting .181 heading into the New Zealand game, with Fernandez
still looking for her first hit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost like the Olympics isn't real,'' she said. ''I'm
0-for-whatever at the plate, and I was already nervous coming in
because of the expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want someone to pinch me and wake me from this nightmare.''

<HEADLINE> Protestant Wins N. Ireland Election  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A fire-and-brimstone critic of
Northern Ireland's peace accord was elected to the British
parliament Friday, reflecting substantial Protestant opposition to
the province's fledgling power-sharing government and its pragmatic
Protestant leader.
</P>
<P>
   To the hoots and hollers of supporters, the Rev. William McCrea
of the Democratic Unionist Party won the by-election to the British
Parliament for the South Antrim seat. He beat a rival from the
Ulster Unionist Party, the more moderate Protestant party that had
represented the district for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict dealt a blow to Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble, the Nobel laureate who last December persuaded his badly
split party to form the key institution proposed in Northern
Ireland's 1998 peace accord: a four-party coalition government that
included the Irish Republican Army's political allies, Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Unionists, who hold posts in the power-sharing
administration but refuse to sit at the same Cabinet table as Sinn
Fein, believe McCrea's victory demonstrates they can overtake the
Ulster Unionists in wider elections next year and become the
predominant Protestant party for the first time. That position
would allow them to pull the plug on power-sharing with Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Notice has been served on David Trimble that his time is up.
There's no confidence in the unionist people in him any more,''
said McCrea, who received 11,601 votes to 10,779 cast for the
Ulster Unionists' David Burnside.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clearly a reflection of the level of unease within the
unionist community at this time,'' Trimble said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   And Burnside -- himself only a halfhearted supporter of the Good
Friday peace accord -- said his defeat demonstrated particular anger
at British government plans to reform Northern Ireland's
predominantly Protestant police, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, or
RUC.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has insisted that the terrorist-hardened force -- which
had nearly 300 members slain and thousands wounded by the IRA
before the outlawed group called a 1997 cease-fire -- will be
renamed the Police Service of Northern Ireland as part of a wider
reform package commissioned under terms of the peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to his campaign workers, Burnside said ''the
disgraceful treatment of the RUC ... symbolizes all that has gone
wrong with this peace process, which unfortunately has turned into
a drip-by-drip appeasement process'' of IRA supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was low at just 43 percent. Analysts said that favored
McCrea, because most moderate but politically unmotivated
Protestant voters didn't bother to turn out to support Trimble's
man.
</P>
<P>
   The by-election was caused by the April death of the district's
Member of Parliament, Clifford Forsythe, who had held the seat for
the Ulster Unionists since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The victory marked a speedy return to Northern Ireland's
political front line for McCrea, a veteran lawmaker and fiery
orator who in 1997 narrowly lost his British parliamentary seat in
a neighboring district to Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness.
</P>
<P>
   McCrea is a minister in the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster,
an anti-Catholic denomination founded by Ian Paisley, the
Democratic Unionist leader.
</P>
<P>
   McCrea is probably best known locally for his prolific career as
a popular Christian singer, with more than two dozen albums and
regular province-wide tours to his credit.
</P>
<P>
   He has been targeted by IRA assassins, most recently in 1994,
when his rural home was riddled with machine-gun bullets. But he
has also courted controversy by publicly backing anti-Catholic
militants, saying he was defending freedom of speech.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Afghanistan's ousted government called Thursday for
increased sanctions against the Taliban at the same time that the religious
militia was lobbying the United Nations for official recognition four years
after taking control of most of the country. A Taliban delegation headed by
Deputy Foreign Minister Abdur Rahman Zahid arrived in New York on Sunday for
what aides said would be the most concerted effort yet by the Taliban to gain
Afghanistan's U.N. seat. Afghanistan is now represented at the United Nations by
the government of ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani, whose alliance controls

Firestone Says Ford Had Wrong Tire Pressure

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The tire pressure that Ford recommends for Explorers is
lower than what Bridgestone/Firestone suggests and makes the popular sport
utility vehicle less safe, a tire company executive told Congress Thursday. The
tire maker wrote Ford this week requesting it raise the recommended pressure
from 26 pounds per square inch (psi) to 30 pounds, Bridgestone/Firestone
executive vice president John Lampe told a House Commerce subcommittee.
Firestone tires, which have been linked to 101 U.S. traffic deaths, are standard

lawsuits brought by about three dozen former POWs, U.S. District Court Judge
Vaughn Walker ruled that a 1951 peace agreement between the United States and
Japan bans such compensation claims. California became a magnet for such cases
last year when the legislature enacted a law allowing victims of slave labor to

<HEADLINE> Report: Port Authority seeking to limit peak flights at La Guardia Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Citing unacceptable delays at La Guardia
Airport, the Port Authority has told airlines they cannot add more
flights during the airport's busiest and most popular flying times,
The New York Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   The ban, effective Oct. 1, would prohibit airlines from adding
new regional flights between 8 a.m. and 9:59 a.m. and between 5:30
p.m. and 8:29 p.m., officials said. The plan was detailed in a
letter dated Tuesday from Robert E. Boyle, the director of the Port
Authority, and sent to the airlines that serve La Guardia. It was
reported Friday in The Times.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even during ideal weather conditions, runway configurations
and air traffic control patterns, the level of delay has increased
to an unacceptable level,'' Boyle wrote, adding: ''Requests to the
airlines from the Port Authority that flights be rescheduled to
other times of the day when there may be some additional capacity
have been disregarded, thus necessitating the above action.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Boyle said that during those times, jet traffic
already meets or exceeds the airport's capacity. The ban is
intended to prevent what airport managers see as the gridlock that
could result from as many as 600 more takeoffs and landings a day,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency foresees the increase in flights under the passage of
a federal law last year creating more slots for smaller regional
jets that hold up to 71 passengers. Boyle wrote that nearly 200
more regional flights a day have already been added since the
passage of the law, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, there were 371,000 total takeoffs and landings from
the airport, up from 358,157 in 1998 and 345,647 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials told the newspaper that the Port Authority, as
the airport's landlord, has the power to act to prevent flight
delays from worsening. A spokesman for Continental Airlines said he
had concerns about the legality of the agency's decision to block
service.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the federal Department of Transportation said
they were reviewing the action. A spokesman for the agency said
there was no formal process in place for mediating disputes between
airlines and airport managers over flight restrictions, The Times
said.
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority officials would not say Thursday how many or
which flights would be affected, but said the flights do not
necessarily have to be canceled, but must be moved to other times,
The Times said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, San Francisco International Airport came to a
compromise with United Airlines, shifting some of the airline's
regular flights to help ease congestion in peak periods.

<HEADLINE> Sosa's Agent Meets With Cubs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa's agent met with Cubs president Andy
MacPhail on Thursday to discuss the outfielder's future.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa had one season left in a $42.5 million, four-year contract
and wants an extension. Earlier this year, he asked the Cubs to
explore a trade but after talks with the New York Yankees
collapsed, he told Chicago he wanted to stay.
</P>

   Since then, his production had returned to normal. He leads the
major leagues with 50 home runs and tops the NL with 136 RBIs.

<P>
   ''We met. We're in preliminary stages and we're working on it,''
said Sosa's agent, Adam Katz.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rider Takes Gold in Equestrian  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- David O'Connor won the individual
three-day event Friday (Thursday night EDT), giving the United
States its first equestrian gold medal since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, of The Plains, Va., riding Custom Made, had a margin
of two jump rails over Andrew Hoy of Australia as he entered the
ring as the last rider. He took down only one.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor added 5 points for that jump rail to his dressage score
of 29.0 and his clean cross-country round to finish with 34.0
points.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest cheers were for hometown favorite Hoy. Aboard
Swizzle In, he moved from fourth to silver with a clean jumping
round and 39.8 points.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Todd of New Zealand won the bronze on Eyespy II with 42.0
points.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor gave himself and his fans a start when he almost made a
wrong turn on course, nearly missing fence 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was so worried about the green gate (fence 6) that I got a
little lost,'' O'Connor said. ''Before going in, I knew exactly
what I had to do -- two rails and no time faults. All kinds of
thoughts were running through my head.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor also won a bronze medal in the team three-day event on
Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Second-seeded Alex O'Brien and Jared
Palmer were upset in their opening doubles match at the Olympics,
dropping the United States to 1-4 in men's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   The only American still alive was Jeff Tarango, who won his
opening singles match.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien and Palmer, making their Olympic debut, lost Friday to
Mark Merklein and Mark Knowles of the Bahamas 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I've ever felt worse in my entire career,'' said
O'Brien, 30. ''I really wanted to step up and do some good for the
U.S. We had a chance to be a bright spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams and U.S. coach Billie Jean King led chants of
''USA! USA!'' from the stands as Venus Williams beat Jana Kandarr
of Germany 6-2, 6-2. Chelsea Clinton and Bill Gates were also in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, seeded second, extended her winning streak to 29
matches and advanced to Sunday's quarterfinal, where she'll face
fifth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, the last player to beat her.
Sanchez-Vicario, a four-time Olympic medalist from Spain, beat
Colombian Fabiola Zuluaga 6-2, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has won four of seven matches against Sanchez-Vicario
but lost the last time they met at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien and Palmer, playing on Court 3 before 250 spectators,
quickly fell behind Merklein and Knowles 4-0. The Americans, who
had a first-round bye because of their seeding, never held a break
point.
</P>
<P>
   ''In hindsight, it probably would have benefited us to play a
first-round match,'' Palmer said. ''They were loose and really
swinging away and got on us early. That set the tone for the
match.''
</P>
<P>
   The doubles defeat was the most surprising setback yet for the
U.S. men's tennis team. O'Brien and Palmer have both been ranked
No. 1 this year, and they reached the semifinals of the Australian
Open and the quarterfinals of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully there's a brighter horizon for us,'' O'Brien said.
''Right now I'm at the bottom of the barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   In other women's singles, eighth-seeded Dominique Van Roost of
Belgium beat Silvia Farina-Elia of Italy 6-1, 7-5.

   BLACKTOWN, Australia (AP) -- South Korea got a pair of
run-scoring singles in the first inning and held the Netherlands to
two hits for a 2-0 victory Friday (Thursday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Park Seok-jin gave up a single and a double in eight innings,
ensuring that South Korea (2-3) wouldn't let another close game
slip away.
</P>
<P>
   In their two previous games, the South Koreans lost to Cuba on
an eighth-inning solo homer and to the United States on an
eighth-inning grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, the Netherlands (2-3) pulled off the biggest
upset in Olympic baseball history, beating Cuba 4-2 to end its
21-game unbeaten streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch couldn't build on the momentum. They managed only four
baserunners -- two on hits, two on walks -- and one scoring threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands loaded the bases with two outs in the second on
a double and a pair of walks. Evert-Jan 't Hoen flew out to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hensley Meulens, who doubled with the bases loaded to set up the
win over Cuba, struck out in three of his four at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Jurriaan Lobbezoo gave up five hits in six innings, three of
them in the first. Lee Byung-kyu led off with a double and scored

<HEADLINE> Swango charged in 1984 slaying of hospital patient  </HEADLINE>
By LIZ SIDOTI
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Franklin County has filed aggravated
murder charges against a former physician who admitted killing
three patients in New York and is suspected of poisoning dozens in
the United States and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Swango, who was charged Thursday with aggravated
murder in the 1984 death of Cynthia Ann McGee, has agreed to plead
guilty, Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   Swango is accused of injecting McGee, 19, with potassium on Jan.
14, 1984, when he was an intern at Ohio State University Hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Swango, 45, pleaded guilty two weeks ago in U.S. District Court
in New York to killing three patients at a veterans' hospital there
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He also had been investigated in Zimbabwe and was convicted of
the nonfatal poisonings of co-workers in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll take what we can get,'' Ed Morgan, assistant prosecutor,
said of the county grand jury indictment. ''I wish we could have
gotten more, but as an attorney I'm bound by the rules of
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan has investigated Swango for 15 years in the suspicious
deaths of at least six patients at Ohio State Hospitals between
1983 and 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always felt that he's been involved in a lot more deaths
at Ohio State, but I didn't have - and still don't have - the
evidence to prove it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his plea on Sept. 6, Swango admitted that he
administered a toxic substance to McGee, according to the
transcript.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say they needed that admission in order to charge
him in Ohio because they had only a nurse's account that she had
seen him entering McGee's hospital room with a syringe just before
the patient lapsed into a coma and died.
</P>
<P>
   Swango also admitted poisoning OSU patient Rena Cooper, who
survived but was paralyzed. Prosecutors can't pursue assault
charges because too much time has passed under Ohio law.
</P>
<P>
   McGee, of the suburb of Dublin, was recuperating from an
accident in Champaign-Urbana, Ill., where she was on the gymnastics
team at the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bone, the driver of the car that struck her bicycle, was
convicted of reckless homicide. Bone, then 17, was sentenced to 30
months' probation and 1,000 hours of community service and lost his
license for several years.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Judy Bone, has said she hoped her son's record would
be cleared if Swango was found to have killed McGee. Morgan said
Bone's attorney could petition the Illinois court to reopen the
case.
</P>
<P>
   McGee's parents, William and Janis McGee of Beverly Hills, Fla.,
could not be reached to comment on the indictment. A telephone
message was left at their home.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Ferguson, spokesman for the Ohio State University Medical
Centers, as the hospital division is now known, said the university
believes it has done everything possible to protect patients'
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State changed certain policies to ensure patients' safety
after McGee died, Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum penalty on the aggravated murder charge is life in
prison with the chance of parole after 20 years, which was the most
severe penalty in 1984, when McGee died.
</P>
<P>
   Swango already has been sentenced to life without parole for the
three New York murders in a plea bargain that spared him the
possibility of the death penalty. He will be sent to a maximum
security prison in Colorado, Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't known when Swango, in federal custody in Brooklyn,
N.Y., will be sent to Columbus to enter his plea, Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Swango also is suspected of poisoning patients in Zimbabwe and
served time in prison for the nonfatal poisoning of co-workers in
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   A book about him, ''Blind Eye: The Story of a Doctor who Got
Away with Murder,'' suggests that Swango might have killed as many
as 35 patients as he moved from hospital to hospital, lying about
his background. Zimbabwe has agreed not to pursue charges.

<HEADLINE> Lacy Wins Again for U.S. Boxers  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER JR.
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Jeff Lacy once again had the right
stuff at the Olympic boxing tournament.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight fight, Lacy used smashing right hands to
dominate an opponent. Friday afternoon (Thursday night EDT) it was
Pawel Kakietek of Poland who could not handle the punching power of
Lacy, who advanced to the 165-pound quarterfinals with a 21-7
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Three Amercians now have advanced to quarterfinals. Five others
have won bouts and three have yet to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The only American boxing on the night program was world
106-pound champion Brian Viloria of Waipahu, Hawaii, who was
scheduled to meet Brahim Asloum of France.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team lost a second fighter when David Jackson of
Seattle was disqualified for weighing three pounds over the limit
for his second-round bout at 132 pounds against Selim Palyani, who
advanced on a walkover.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were really hoping he would be able to maintain his weight
throughout the tournament, and obviously we are really
disappointed,'' U.S. team coach Tom Mustin said of Jackson's being
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the U.S. champion at 132 pounds in 1997, was out of
boxing because of personal problems in 1998-99. He weighed 174
pounds last October, boxed at 139 in the U.S. championships in
January and got a silver medal.
</P>
<P>
   The 139-pound U.S. boxer is Ricardo Williams Jr. of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   World 132-pound champion Mario Kindelan of Cuba outpointed
Phongsit Wiangviset of Thailand and advanced to the quarterfinals.
Nine Cubans have won at least once. One has lost.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the best action fights of the tournament, 30-year-old
Rafael Lozano of Spain, boxing in his third Olympics, beat Danilo
Lerio of the Philippines 17-15 in a second-round bout at 106 pounds
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Lerio took a 7-6 lead when he knocked down Lozano with a left to
the head just before the bell ended the second round. The Filipino
led 10-8 after three rounds. In the fourth round, the two men
exchanged scoring blows until the 4-foot-11 Spaniard, several
inches shorter Lerio, broke a 15-15 tie with two scoring rights to
the head in the closing seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano won a controversial decision over world champion Eric
Griffin of Houston at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. He won a
bronze medal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In another 106-pound bout in the afternoon, Kim Un Chol, the
only North Korean boxer in the tournament, dominated the third
round 10-2 and won 20-8 against Pal Lakatos, a 32-year-old veteran
of international competition from Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Liborio Romero of Mexico, who staged a stirring comeback victory
in the first round, failed to advance to the 106-pound
quarterfinals when he lost 24-11 to Ivan Stapovic of Lithuania.

<HEADLINE> Records Fall in Women's 25m Pistol  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Maria Grozdeva of Bulgaria broke the
Olympic record with a score of 690.3 in the women's 25-meter
pistol, after double-medalist Tao Luna set the Olympic qualifying
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Grozdeva set the mark Friday (Thursday night EDT) after Yang
Ling of China edged Moldova's Oleg Moldovan to win the gold medal
in the 10-meter running target at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Grozdeva broke the record of China's Li Duihong, who scored
687.9 at the 1996 Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did what was supposed to be done,'' Grozdeva said. ''I had
the strongest wish to beat the Chinese girl. I got my wish, my
dream title.''
</P>
<P>
   Tao, who also won the women's air pistol, had 590 points to lead
the eight-women final and snap Li's mark of 589.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was not too nervous, but I probably paid more attention on
my first few shots,'' Tao said. ''I became nervous on my last shot
and I started to think too early.''
</P>
<P>
   Lolita Evglevskaya of Belarus took the bronze with a score of
686.
</P>
<P>
   Beki Snyder of Grand Junction, Colo., finished in a ninth-place
tie with 580 points, two short of the final qualifier. Janine
Bowman of Woonsocket, R.I., was 24th with a score of 574.
</P>
<P>
   Yang, the World Cup winner at Milan, scored 681.1 to top
Moldovan's 681.0 and win. Niu Zhiyuan, also of China, took the
bronze with a score of 677.4.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't think,'' Yang said. ''All I wanted was to do well.
Winning by one point ... I'm really excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Saathoff of Hereford, Ariz., finished in a three-way tie
for 12th with 570 points. Lance Dement of Runge, Texas was 18th
with 541.
</P>
<P>
   Yang and Moldovan were among five players who scored 293 points
in the first day of qualifying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very difficult, but I feel very blessed to have won a
medal,'' said Moldovan, who trailed Yang 581-580 heading into the
eight-man final.
</P>
<P>
   Niu was ranked 15th after the first day and shot a 292 during
the fast runs to reach the final round.

<HEADLINE> Isler Leads in Olympic Sailing Race  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- J.J. Isler reclaimed first place in the
women's 470 fleet, and men's 470 skipper Paul Foerster guided the
third U.S. boat to a fleet race victory in the Olympic regatta
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With the breeze kicking up to 12 knots, Jonathan and Charlie
McKee of Seattle led at all five turning marks to win the 11th
fleet race in the 49er class. Coupled with two third-place finishes
earlier in the day, they held onto first place.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers raced on one of the innermost courses on Sydney
Harbor, within sight of Sydney Opera House, the Harbor Bridge and
several spectator vantage points on shore. Several dozen fans lined
the tip of Bradley's Head.
</P>
<P>
   The 49er is a high-performance, winged skiff making its Olympic
debut. It was designed four years ago along the lines of the famous
Sydney 18-footers. The two-man crew stands on the wings the whole
race, held in by a trapeze harness, and hike out as far as possible
to try to keep the boats level.
</P>
<P>
   Although they've yet to get winds in the 20-knot range that
would really make them fly, the 49ers have been among the most
exciting boats here.
</P>
<P>
   The skiffs had been easily identifiable by their country flag
spinnakers during their first two races, but those have been stowed
because the cloth was weakened during the printing process.
</P>
<P>
   They're still easy to pick out, flying spinnakers in the Olympic
colors of red, blue, green, yellow and black.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan McKee, 40, won the gold medal in the Flying Dutchman in
1984 and Charlie McKee, 38, won the bronze in the 470 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Isler, of San Diego, finished fourth in the fifth 470 fleet
race, a finish good enough to move her from third to first overall.
Isler and her crew, Pease Glaser of Long Beach, Calif., were in
first place after the first two fleet races on Wednesday, then
dropped to third on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Isler led at the end of the first downwind leg. She couldn't
hold the lead, but stayed in touch with the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Isler won the bronze medal in 1992, then went into big-boat
sailing, including the America's Cup in 1995. She was tactician on
the all-women's America3 crew, but with the team struggling, she
was replaced by Dave Dellenbaugh, who had been one of the team's
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Foerster's win moved him from sixth to fourth overall. He passed
the French boat sailing downwind on the second-to-last leg, then
held the lead on the short reaching leg to the finish just off
Middle Head in the outer part of Sydney Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Foerster, of Garland, Texas, joined Isler and the McKees as
fleet-race winners.
</P>
<P>
   Foerster won the silver medal in the discontinued Flying
Dutchman class in 1992. His crew member is Bob Merrick of
Portsmouth, R.I.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Accompanied by chants of ''USA! USA!''
led by her sister and her coach, Venus Williams advanced Friday to
the Olympic quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Williams extended her winning streak to 29 matches, beating Jana

U.S. coach Billie Jean King led the chants in a crowd that included
Chelsea Clinton and Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stars and stripes, USA,'' Williams said with a grin.
''Everyone else has team spirit. So should we.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up for the second-seeded Williams will be fifth-seeded
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, the last player to beat her.
Sanchez-Vicario, a four-time Olympic medalist from Spain, defeated
Colombian Fabiola Zuluaga 6-2, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has won four of seven matches against Sanchez-Vicario,
but lost the last time they met at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't have the same game I usually have,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded Alex O'Brien and Jared Palmer were upset in their

had a first-round bye because of their seeding, never held a break
point.
</P>
<P>
   ''In hindsight, it probably would have benefited us to play a
first-round match,'' Palmer said. ''They were loose and really
swinging away and got on us early. That set the tone for the
match.''
</P>
<P>
   The doubles defeat was the most surprising setback yet for the
U.S. men's tennis team. O'Brien and Palmer have both been ranked
No. 1 this year, and they reached the semifinals of the Australian
Open and the quarterfinals of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully there's a brighter horizon for us,'' O'Brien said.
''Right now I'm at the bottom of the barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   In other women's singles, eighth-seeded Dominique Van Roost of
Belgium beat Silvia Farina-Elia of Italy 6-1, 7-5.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- It was a day for an Olympic double
feature: ''The Exorcist,'' starring the U.S. softball team. And
''American Beauty,'' featuring the debut of U.S. track stars
Michael Johnson, Maurice Greene and Marion Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, Greene and Johnson easily finished first in their heats
Friday (Thursday night EDT), the first step toward success in
Sydney. And the softball squad, reeling after three straight
extra-inning losses, beat New Zealand 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting just .181 as a team and desperate for runs, the softball
team conducted an athletes' village ceremony to lift the ''voodoo
curse'' from their bats. It worked for Jennifer Brundage, who went
3-for-3 with a homer, and star Lisa Fernandez, who had her first
hit Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans can advance to the medal round with a victory over
Italy on Saturday (Friday night EDT). Once there, they would need
three consecutive victories to repeat as gold medalists.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- TRACK: Jones and Johnson made two statements -- one athletic,
one sartorial -- in their debuts at the 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, seeking five gold medals before she leaves Australia,
enjoyed a leisurely win in her first heat of the 100 meters while
wearing custom-made, chrome-covered black shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Medal favorite Johnson, sporting gold shoes, wasted no time in
kicking off his quest for back-to-back golds in the 400 meters. On
Day One of the track and field, the defending gold medalist cruised
to an easy victory in his first-round heat.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson advanced to the second round with U.S. teammates Alvin
Harrison and Antonio Pettigrew.
</P>
<P>
   The first track and field medal went to Robert Korzeniowski of
Poland in the 20-kilometer walk after the first finisher, Bernardo
Segura of Mexico, was disqualified. No reason for the
disqualification was immediately cited.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who wept while watching the 1996 Olympics from the
stands, celebrated with a smile after winning his first-round heat
in the 100 meters. Greene holds the world record of 9.79 seconds,
but had failed to qualify for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Also advancing to the second round were Americans Curtis Johnson
and Jon Drummond, 1996 bronze medalist Ato Boldon of Trinidad &AMP;
Tobago and defending champion Donovan Bailey of Canada. Bailey
overcome a flu bug to advance.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 800, it was a family affair as Joetta
Clark-Diggs, her kid sister, Hazel Clark, and their sister-in-law,
Jearl Miles-Clark, all easily advanced to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   All three American shot putters also advanced to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   When the women's 400 heats begin, defending gold medalist
Marie-Jose Perec will not be there. After a mysterious day where
she flew to Singapore and watched a friend scuffle with a
cameraman, the Frenchwoman officially dropped out of the Olympics
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   WEIGHTLIFTING: The next event for U.S. weightlifter Tara Nott:
picking up a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   The 105-pound weightlifter was awarded the gold Friday after the
winner in her event, along with a second Bulgarian lifter, tested
positive for a banned diuretic. It is the first U.S. weightlifting
gold since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria's Izabela Dragneva -- the first women's weightlifting
champion in Olympic history -- and men's bronze medalist Sevdalin
Minchev tested positive for furosemide, the same diuretic for which
another Bulgarian lifter was kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   After the test results became public, Bulgaria's entire
weightlifting team was thrown out of the Olympics and suspended
from international competition for 12 months. It was the second
time in 12 years that Bulgarian weightlifters have been ejected
from an Olympics for using the banned weight-losing drug.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- EQUESTRIAN: David O'Connor won the individual three-day event
Friday, giving the United States its first equestrian gold medal
since 1984. The Virginian defeated Australia's Andrew Hoy by
clearing all but one jump rail after entering the ring as the last
rider.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BOXING: The U.S. boxers took a blow at the weigh-in Friday
when 132-pounder David Jackson failed to make the weight limit.
Jackson, scheduled to fight Selim Palyani of Turkey in a
second-round bout later in the day, tipped the scales at 135.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the ring, they fared better. Jeff Lacy advanced to
the 165-pound quarterfinals with a 21-7 victory over Pawel Kakietek
of Poland, making him the third American to advance that far.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BEACH VOLLEYBALL: Winning ugly is one thing. How do you
describe this? The U.S. beach volleyball tandem of Rob Heidger and
Kevin Wong lost its first two matches, but advanced on point
difference as the tournament's ''lucky loser.'' On Friday (Thursday
night EDT), the pair reach the quarterfinals when their Mexican
opponents forfeited due to injury.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SWIMMING: With two gold medals already in her pocket, Inge de
Bruijn of the Netherlands set herself up as the woman to beat in
the 50-meter freestyle. De Bruijn set an Olympic record of 24.46
seconds to win her heat.
</P>
<P>
   Americans Dara Torres and Amy Van Dyken finished second and
third one day after teammate Jenny Thompson failed in her bid for
an individual gold medal. Thompson's bronze helped the United
States collect eight medals on the sixth night of the swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 27, took a bronze medal in the 100-meter freestyle,
giving her a career total of nine -- adding that one to her seven
relay golds and one individual silver. But she failed to get the
individual gold medal she had been seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ''The individual gold medal wasn't in the cards, I guess,''
Thompson said. ''I'm just completely satisfied with how I did. I
know I did the best I could.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers back her up: Nine medals made her the most-decorated
woman swimmer in history. Thompson also broke a tie with American
swimmer Shirley Babashoff for most Olympic medals by an American
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- TENNIS: The next opponent for Venus Williams is the last woman
to beat her. Williams advanced to the Olympic quarterfinals by
knocking off Jana Kandarr of Germany 6-2, 6-2. Next up for the
second-seeded Williams will be fifth-seeded Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario, the four-time Olympic medalist from Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez-Vicario's victory over Williams in the French Open was
the American's last loss.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmarish effort by the U.S. men's tennis team continued
when second-seeded Alex O'Brien and Jared Palmer were upset in
their opening doubles match, dropping the United States to 1-4 in
men's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   The only American man still alive after the first round was Jeff
Tarango, who won his opening singles match.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- ROWING: The Americans qualified nine boats for the weekend
finals. Lightweight rowers Christine and Sarah Garner won their
semifinal heat Friday to advance to the Olympic double sculls medal
race.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Beach Volleyball Team Advances  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Rob Heidger and Kevin Wong may be the
luckiest losers of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   The American beach volleyball team won on a forfeit to move into
the quarterfinals on Friday (Thursday night EDT) when their Mexican
opponents dropped out due to injury.
</P>
<P>
   That means the seventh-seeded team that lost its opening match,
then lost its second consolation match but still advanced on point
differential as the ''lucky loser,'' has reached the final eight of
the men's competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will play the winner of a match later Friday
between countrymen Dain Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana, seeded ninth,
and Norway's Jorre Kjemperud and Vegard Hoidalen, seeded eighth.
</P>
<P>
   In other matches Friday, top-seeded Julien Prosser and Lee
Zahner of Australia were ousted, losing 15-8 to the fourth-seeded
Laciga brothers of Switzerland. Defending bronze medalists John
Child and Mark Heese of Canada advanced 15-6 over Mikhail
Kouchnerev and Sergey Ermishin of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Heidger and Wong remained in the sold-out Bondi Beach stadium
after the announcement of the forfeit and an hour-long break before
the next match drew an angry audience response. They goaded NBC
analyst Mike Dodd, a silver medalist in beach volleyball four years
ago, to join in an exhibition match teamed with Juan Ibarra of the
Mexican team. It ended in a 6-6 tie with the fans on their feet
cheering.
</P>
<P>
   Ibarra and Joel Sotelo forfeited due to Sotelo's groin muscle
injury that was aggravated in their first-round upset over the
top-seeded Australians. Sotelo said he initially injured himself in
July, and felt the muscle tear again near the end of their 15-12
victory on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe this,'' he said. ''Only a miracle'' would have
allowed him to play, Sotelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Heidger and Wong called the forfeit a mixed blessing -- they
reached the quarterfinals,but now will go five days from their last
match Tuesday until the quarterfinal round on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are saying, 'God what a break,' but in a way, I really
think this is not to our advantage,'' Heidger said. ''I wish we had
gotten to play a full-speed game at game-like intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Heidger and Wong had been questioned over whether they
intentionally lost their second consolation match to get a better
draw against the 24th-ranked Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Even the president of the FIVB, the international volleyball
federation, conceded Thursday the system for choosing four teams
from 12 first-round losers to advance to the final 16 included a
circumstance in which a second loss became an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We never thought that this could create some doubts about the
results of a game,'' Ruben Acosta of FIVB said. ''It seems that
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   For Heidger and Wong to be competing is fortunate after they
dropped their opening match 17-15 to Canadians Jody Holden and
Conrad Leinemann, then split their consolation games, beating a
French team before losing to Prosser and Zahner.
</P>
<P>
   Because Heidger and Wong had the best points differential of the
three teams that lost their second consolation matches, they
advanced as the ''lucky losers.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the tournament format, the lucky loser automatically was
placed at the top of the second-round bracket, presumably to face
the No. 1 seed. The other three consolation survivors were paired
with the second, third and fourth seeds.
</P>
<P>
   When Ibarra and Sotelo upset Prosser and Zahner, though, being
the lucky loser brought a match with the 24th-seeded team. That
circumstance, and the way the Americans lost to Prosser and Zahner
on Tuesday, raised questions.
</P>
<P>
   Heidger and Wong took control early, surging to a 9-4 lead. Nine
points was the amount they needed to guarantee they had the best
points difference and would advance to the second round, win or
lose.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, the Australians rebounded in a match they
had to win. The final score was 15-11 for Prosser and Zahner,
benefiting both teams and delighting the host nation and volleyball
officials eager for continued sellout crowds at the spectacular
Bondi Beach venue.
</P>
<P>
   Heidger and Wong denied they lost on purpose to face the
Mexicans. They said they played hard even though a victory would
have drawn them against one of the two favored Brazilian teams or
the fourth-seeded Laciga brothers of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Acosta and Sinjin Smith, a longtime player who now heads the
FIVB beach volleyball world council, acknowledged that seed
jockeying is a part of volleyball, but insisted it had no bearing
on the overall outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day, the winner will be the best team,''
Acosta said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said any team playing in the Olympics that knew it had
qualified for the next round would take it easy to preserve
strength and avoid injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you know you don't have to win, why are you going to kill
yourself when you have difficult matches coming up?'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Disqualified in 20K Walk  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Bernardo Segura of Mexico, world record
holder in the 20-kilometer walk, was disqualified moments after
crossing the finish line first at the Olympic Games Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The disqualification sent the gold medal to Robert Korzeniowski
of Poland, who finished just behind Segura in a tight race. It was
the first track medal of the games.
</P>
<P>
   Segura was accused of improperly breaking contact with the
ground three times during the race. Olympic officials rejected an
appeal by Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Segura denied breaking any rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't give me back a medal I never lost. I won clearly.
They can't disqualify me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be unfair because I ran a clean race.''
</P>
<P>
   Segura was the bronze medalist at Atlanta four years ago and
crossed the finish line Friday in a time of 1 hour, 18 minutes, 58
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Korzeniowski, the gold medalist at the Atlanta games in 1996,
finished in 1 hour 18 minutes, 59 seconds. Noe Hernandez, also from
Mexico, won the silver medal, followed by Vladimir Andreyev of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez offered support for his teammate.
</P>
<P>
   I can't believe Segura was disqualified,'' he said. ''It's
nonsense. He won the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Segura, Korzeniowski and Hernandez entered Olympic Stadium side
by side after the walk, which took them through the streets of
Sydney. Then Segura, the Pan American Games champion and World Cup
winner last year, who posted a world best time of 1:17.25 for the
event in 1994, pulled a few strides in front in the final 100
meters.
</P>
<P>
   After they crossed the finish line, Segura and Hernadez wrapped
themselves in the Mexican flag as they celebrated together.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican team said officials should have charged Segura with
only two violations of improper form. A third instance of lifting
feet and breaking contact with the ground -- in other words, jogging
instead of walking -- results in automatic disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took a risk at the end for the gold,'' said Tim Seaman of
Chula Vista, Calif., the only American in the walk, who was unsure
what place he had finished an hour after the race. ''You're always
pushing, pushing, pushing. The gold is never easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Segura has parlayed his fame into a political career. This year
he finished a three-year term in Mexico's federal congress and he
also had been running for mayor of his home town, San Mateo Atenco
near Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 interview, Segura told the Mexican newspaper Cronica
that the style of race walking has changed in recent years as
competitors sped up.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing that has not been changed is the rule,'' he
said. ''So if the judges stick 100 percent to what's on paper, we
would all be disqualified.''

<HEADLINE> Jones, Greene, Johnson Win Heats  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Michael Johnson wore gold shoes.
Maurice Greene wore a smile. Marion Jones chickened out on her
chance to wear something really different.
</P>
<P>
   All three strolled to wins in first-round heats as track and
field events began Friday (Thursday night EDT) at the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The first track medal of the games was mired in controversy.
Mexico's Bernardo Segura crossed the finish line first in the
20-kilometer walk, but later was disqualified for three instances
of breaking contact with the ground.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the gold medal to Poland's Robert Korzeniowski, with
Noe Hernandez of Mexico second and Vladimir Andreyev of Russia
third.
</P>
<P>
   Jones began her quest for five gold medals with a leisurely win
in 11.20 seconds in her heat of the women's 100. She wore
custom-made black shoes covered with shiny chrome, instead of the
radical pair designed for her for the games.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes she decided not to wear are made of thermoplastic
urethane and are clear. And they have no heels. They are touted as
the lightest spiked track shoes ever made at 3.5 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel great, I feel great. You know, it's been a long time. I
was just waiting and watching. But it's here now, so no more
excuses,'' Jones said. She said the biggest problem she faced in
the first round was almost getting knocked over by a gust of wind
as she stepped into the starting blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm having a ball. I'm 24 years old, I'm in Sydney, I'm
running great,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Jones in the second round were U.S. teammates Chryste
Gaines and Torri Edwards, a late replacement for the injured Inger
Miller -- who withdrew from the race because of a severely sprained
left hamstring. Gaines' time of 11.06 seconds was the best of the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   Also advancing was Merlene Ottey, a seven-time Olympic medalist
who substituted at the last minute for a Jamaican teammate. Some
Jamaican team members protested when Ottey, who is returning from a
one-year drug ban, replaced Peta-Gaye Dowdie in the 100.
</P>
<P>
   Greene began his quest for a men's 100-meter gold with a
celebratory smile.
</P>
<P>
   He breezed to an easy victory in 10.31 seconds in his
first-round heat, then strutted and waved to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just happy to get the show started and eager to keep it
going,'' he said. ''You just want to get through the first round as
easy as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who holds the world record of 9.79 seconds, failed to
qualify for the 1996 Olympics and drove 18 hours from his home in
Kansas City to Atlanta to see the games. During the 100 final, he
sat in the stands and cried uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   Also advancing to the second round were Americans Curtis Johnson
and Jon Drummond. Ato Boldon, the 1996 bronze medalist from
Trinidad &AMP; Tobago, won his heat in 10.04 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Donovan Bailey of Canada, who set a world
record of 9.84 seconds while winning in Atlanta but has been
tormented by injuries the past two years, also advanced by
finishing third in his heat in 10.39 seconds. Bailey has been
battling the flu the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, Bailey sat by himself on a bench for about 15
minutes -- his head in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson strolled to an easy victory in his first-round heat of
the men's 400.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson finished in 45.25 seconds and advanced to Saturday's
second round. Joining him in the next round were U.S. teammates
Alvin Harrison and Antonio Pettigrew, who also won their heats.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, wearing a full body suit and long sleeves on a hot,
sunny day, had the fastest qualifying time of 44.96.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, master of the men's 400 for more than a decade, is an
overwhelming favorite to become the first man to win the event in
consecutive Olympics. He has won four straight world championships,
setting the world record of 43.18 seconds while winning that title
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It felt pretty easy today, so I think I got the mission
accomplished,'' Johnson said. ''It's really great to get it
started. It was a fun week hanging out down here, but now it's
business and I'm ready to get it going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clark clan had a good day in the women's 800 meters, and all
three American shot putters advanced to the final.
</P>
<P>
   Joetta Clark-Diggs, her kid sister, Hazel Clark, and their
sister-in-law, Jearl Miles-Clark, all easily advanced to the
semifinals of the women's 800.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Mutola of Mozambique, who won the bronze medal in 1996,
also moved into the semis. But the reigning world champion, Ludmila
Formanova of the Czech Republic, dropped out on the second lap of
her heat because of a sore left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   In the shot put, 1996 silver medalist John Godina had the
second-best throw of 67 feet, 6&AMP;frac14; inches in the qualifying round.
Also advancing were fellow Americans Adam Nelson and Andy Bloom.
Arsi Harju of Finland had the best qualifying throw of 70-2&AMP;frac14;.
</P>
<P>
   Godina was a late Olympic replacement for U.S. teammate C.J.
Hunter, the reigning world champion. Hunter dropped out after
arthroscopic knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In the walk, officials upheld the disqualification of Segura,
who won the bronze medal in 1996 in that event and holds the world
record.
</P>
<P>
   Segura denied breaking any rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't disqualify me,'' he said. ''It would be unfair
because I ran a clean race.''

<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- In the opener of their biggest series of the
season, the Oakland Athletics showed the Seattle Mariners the AL
West race isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hudson won his fifth consecutive start and Matt Stairs hit a
tiebreaking, two-run single in the sixth inning as the A's rallied
past Seattle 5-2 Thursday night, closing within two games of the
division leader.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson (18-6) started the four-game series by falling behind 2-0
in the first inning, then shut out Seattle for the next five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   In all, he gave up one earned run and five hits in six-plus
innings, improving to 3-0 against the Mariners this season and 4-0
in his career and kept Oakland tied with Cleveland for the wild
card lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mecir relieved with two on and no outs in the seventh,
retired Rickey Henderson on a grounder, then struck out Alex
Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Isringhausen pitched the ninth for his 30th save in 37
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland (83-68) improved to 7-3 against the Mariners (86-67)
this season and won at Seattle for the third time in four games
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Moyer (13-10), just 2-7 in 11 starts since beating Oakland
on July 24, gave up five runs and six hits in 5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Olivares (3-8) pitches for the A's on Friday night against
Freddy Garcia (8-4).
</P>
<P>
   Seattle went ahead in the first when Mike Cameron walked,
Rodriguez singled and stole second and Martinez hit an RBI
grounder. Rodriguez scored when Hudson misplayed John Olerud's
roller up the first-base line for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada homered in the fourth, and the A's went ahead with
a four-run sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland loaded the bases of Jose Ortiz's single (his first major
league hit), Jason Giambi's double and an intentional walk to
Tejada. After Ben Grieve popped out, Moyer forced in the tying run
by walking Adam Piatt on a 3-1 pitch, then gave up a two-run single
to Stairs. Eric Chavez chased Moyer with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland second baseman Randy Velarde made the defensive play of
the game when, with two outs in the bottom of the sixth and runners
on first and second, he ran into shallow right field to catch David
Bell's fly ball, saving a run.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson gave up a pinch single to Raul Ibanez and a bunt single
to Mark McLemore to open the seventh before Mecir relieved.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Velarde was out of the A's starting lineup because Moyer
was pitching and Velarde was 0-for-20 against him, including
0-for-6 this season. . ... The Mariners have agreed to a two-year
player development contract with the San Antonio Missions of the
Double-A Texas League. They were affiliated with New Haven of the
Double-A Eastern League the past two seasons.

<HEADLINE> Venus Wins, Meets Chelsea Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Serena Williams led chants as Venus
Williams won her match, and Chelsea Clinton applauded them both.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams extended her winning streak to 29 matches Friday,
beating Jana Kandarr of Germany 6-2, 6-2 in the third round of the
Olympics. Serena Williams led chants of ''USA! USA!'' for a
center-court crowd that included President Clinton's daughter and
Microsoft founder Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the two sisters met Clinton and gave her a USA tennis
pin. Clinton praised the chanting, and Venus liked it too.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stars and stripes, USA,'' she said with a grin. ''Everyone
else has team spirit. So should we.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up for the second-seeded Williams will be fifth-seeded
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, the last player to beat her.
Sanchez-Vicario, a four-time Olympic medalist from Spain, defeated
Colombian Fabiola Zuluaga 6-2, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has won four of seven matches against Sanchez-Vicario,
but lost the last time they met at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't have the same game I usually have,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded Alex O'Brien and Jared Palmer were upset in their
opening doubles match, dropping the United States to 1-4 in men's
tennis. The only American still alive was Jeff Tarango, who won his
opening singles match.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien and Palmer, making their Olympic debut, lost to Mark
Merklein and Mark Knowles of the Bahamas 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I've ever felt worse in my entire career,'' said
O'Brien, 30. ''I really wanted to step up and do some good for the
U.S. We had a chance to be a bright spot.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien and Palmer, playing on Court 3 before 250 spectators,
quickly fell behind Merklein and Knowles 4-0. The Americans, who
had a first-round bye because of their seeding, never held a break
point.
</P>
<P>
   ''In hindsight, it probably would have benefited us to play a
first-round match,'' Palmer said. ''They were loose and really
swinging away and got on us early. That set the tone for the
match.''
</P>
<P>
   The doubles defeat was the most surprising setback yet for the
U.S. men's tennis team. O'Brien and Palmer have both been ranked
No. 1 this year, and they reached the semifinals of the Australian
Open and the quarterfinals of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully there's a brighter horizon for us,'' O'Brien said.
''Right now I'm at the bottom of the barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   In other women's singles, eighth-seeded Dominique Van Roost of
Belgium beat Silvia Farina-Elia of Italy 6-1, 7-5.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Promotes Dems in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Joseph Lieberman kept the
Democratic pressure on in Florida Thursday, crediting Vice
President Al Gore with helping create high-tech jobs here.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's presence in the state -- for the second time in less
than two weeks -- reflected the importance of the state and its 25
electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's brother, Jeb, is governor, and Republicans had
long counted on Florida in the election, but recent polls show the
race is a dead heat. Bush planned to campaign here on Friday and
Saturday, and Gore was coming to Florida on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, in a 45-minute speech to 350 employees at Cirent
Semiconductor in Orlando, touted the Democratic ticket's plans for
a high-tech future -- with a few suggestions that Gore was a chief
architect of the nation's current economy.
</P>
<P>
   His speech was the first in a series of talks being packaged and
labeled by his aides as Lieberman's ''Vision for America.'' The
speeches -- about one per week -- are intended to give Lieberman a
platform to home in on one particular area of the Gore-Lieberman
campaign platform, in this case economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's speech, Lieberman said Gore plans to spur research
and development in science and technology, provide educational
opportunities to people throughout their lives, and use fiscal
discipline to sustain the nation's growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our prosperity didn't happen by accident, and it won't
continue by inertia,'' he said. ''It will only happen if we in
government and you in the private sector continue to make the right
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman noted that information technology is changing the way
Americans live, joking that global positioning systems have helped
stubborn men.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember that old joke about why Moses and the children of
Israel wandered for 40 years in the desert because Moses didn't
want to stop to ask anybody for directions?'' he asked with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to nearby Disney World, Lieberman said that
today, there are more high-tech workers in central Florida than
theme park employees.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that retraining America's workers as technologies
cause job changes is vital to maintaining economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the 21st century, we must have a president who understands
the terrain of the new economy. We need a president who will
continue and expand our prosperity by investing in the people who
are driving the new economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about a plan Gore announced Thursday to use the nation's
oil reserve to help stabilize heating oil and gasoline costs,
Lieberman said that neither Bush nor his running mate Dick Cheney --
both former oil company executives -- would do anything to help.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sadly, the Bush-Cheney ticket has no plan for stopping
spiraling gas and home heating oil costs. They have no plan for
reducing our dependency on oil and in fact would increase our crude
addiction,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that criticism, Lieberman didn't mention the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   At a union rally later in Ft. Lauderdale, Lieberman told about
250 pipe fitters, plumbers, sprinkler fitters and others he
believes he and Gore can take the Sunshine State.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we win the state of Florida, there ain't no way we're going
to lose this election,'' Lieberman said. Afterward, he was
attending two events to raise $1 million for the Democratic
National Committee.

<HEADLINE> Remains at Suspected Mob Graveyard  </HEADLINE>
By THEO EMERY
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUINCY, Mass. (AP) -- Investigators digging in a suspected mob
burial ground for two murder victims found the remains of a man on
Thursday and said they would continue looking for a second victim.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were believed to be looking for the remains of
Debbie Davis, last seen in 1981, and Tommy King, who disappeared in
1975. Davis was the girlfriend of Stephen ''The Rifleman'' Flemmi,
an associate of fugitive mob boss James ''Whitey'' Bulger. King
vanished after a bar fight with Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   The man's remains were found in a marshy area under a subway
trestle not far from a house Bulger once lived in near the Neponset
River.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Davis' family held vigil Thursday outside the
roped-off crime scene, where investigators erected a tent shortly
after the remains were discovered. The family declined to comment.
The remains have yet to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The body found Thursday was the fifth alleged victim of Bulger
that state and federal investigators have uncovered in three burial
sites since January.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said investigators were acting on the same
information that led them to the skeletal remains, thought to be
Bulger rival Paul McGonagle, found in Boston's Dorchester
neighborhood last week. Three other sets of remains believed to be
Bulger victims were found in the same neighborhood earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The tips leading to the discovery of the remains reportedly came
from Bulger lieutenant Kevin Weeks who pleaded guilty to federal
racketeering charges in July and is cooperating with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger has been on the run since he was indicted for
racketeering in 1995. Flemmi is in prison awaiting trial on a
variety of charges.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Heads to Gulf Coast  </HEADLINE>
By BILL KACZOR
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Storm warnings were posted along the Gulf
Coast on Thursday after Tropical Storm Helene formed and quickly
gained strength in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The center of the storm was expected to make landfall sometime
Friday near Fort Walton Beach, east of Pensacola. A hurricane watch
was posted for much of the western Florida coast and at least 5 to
8 inches of rain were expected in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this moment, we do not feel it's going to actually reach
hurricane strength,'' said Robert Molleda, a forecaster with the
National Hurricane Center in Miami. ''It'll mostly be a rain
event.''
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m., the storm was centered 95 miles south of Pensacola
with sustained winds of near 65 mph. It was moving at 15 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that strong,'' said Bob McCabe at his home at Navarre
Beach, 20 miles east of Pensacola. ''I'm hoping it hits east of
here. ... I'd rather see it fizzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Evacuations normally are not required with a storm of Helene's
predicted intensity, but authorities along the Gulf Coast prepared
disaster plans anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters were opened, military planes were evacuated from bases
in the Florida Panhandle and schools districts in Okaloosa, Walton
and Santa Rosa counties canceled Friday classes. Government offices
also were closed in Okaloosa County.
</P>
<P>
   Helene was expected to cause storm-surge flooding of up to 5
feet above normal tide levels in some places, said Jack Beven, a
specialist with the hurricane center.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical storm warnings stretched from Pascagoula, Miss. to
Florida's Aucilla River, southeast of Tallahassee. Flood warnings
were posted for parts of the Florida coast, still soggy from the
weekend passage of Tropical Storm Gordon, and a flood watch was
posted in northern Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Isaac, which strengthened from a
depression late Thursday, posed no threat to land. The storm is in
the far eastern Atlantic, south of the Cape Verde Islands off
northwestern Africa.

<HEADLINE> Power Outage Darkens Cheney's Hotel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTERFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Dick Cheney derided Al Gore for the
threat of brownouts in California, but the Republican vice
presidential candidate couldn't blame Gore for the blackout
Thursday at his hotel near St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a media plot,'' Cheney said as he sat in his car outside
the Doubletree Hotel, which was totally darkened by a power outage
that lasted about an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The elevators were out of order as a result, so the Secret
Service held Cheney's motorcade at the hotel entrance after he and
his wife Lynne returned from dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The couple sat in the back of the car reading as hordes of
Secret Service agents, police, advance men and a group of reporters
gathered about the hotel, some holding candles. Helicopters with
spotlights whirled overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred customers lost power in the area, said officials
at AmerenUE, the power company. The cause was not immediately
known, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheneys were later taken to another hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Cheney blamed the threat of brownouts in
California on what he said were mistakes in Gore's energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   Neither police nor hotel personnel could say what caused the
lights to dim or explain why a backup system did not kick in.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's daughter Mary, who is unpaid personal assistant to her
father and was working out in the hotel gym at the time of the
blackout, came down to the dark lobby to check on his whereabouts.

<HEADLINE> West Nile Virus Found in Maryland  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- State officials announced plans for insecticide
spraying Thursday in central Maryland after two dead crows found in
the region tested positive for West Nile virus, the first time the
virus was detected in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The infected birds were found in Relay, about 10 miles south of
Baltimore, on Sept. 13 and in nearby Columbia, midway between
Baltimore and Washington, on Sept. 15., said Dr. Georges Benjamin,
secretary of the state health department. No one in Maryland has
been infected.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito-borne virus also has been found in birds in New
York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
Eleven people have been diagnosed with the virus in New York City
and one in New Jersey. None has died.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is commonly carried by bloodsucking mosquitoes, which
transmit the virus through bites. Infection may result in
encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, an
inflammation of the brain's lining and the spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, during the first known appearance of the West Nile
virus in the Western Hemisphere, seven people died and 62 others
were infected in the New York metropolitan area.

<HEADLINE> Famed Painter Remains Said Found  </HEADLINE>
By ALESSANDRA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- For centuries, the life of Giotto, considered the
father of European painting, has been wrapped in mystery. His exact
birth date was not known, his remains were never found.
</P>
<P>
   Now, an Italian anthropology professor claims he has one of the
keys: A skeleton unearthed 30 years ago beneath Florence's Duomo
cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   A chalk reconstruction based on the analyses of the skull shows
a strong resemblance to a presumed self-portrait of the master in
Giotto's famous cycle of frescoes in Padua's Scrovegni Chapel,
Francesco Mallegni told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Some Italian scholars expressed skepticism. Mallegni said he
plans to make DNA tests on the skeleton's teeth to back up his
claim.
</P>
<P>
   Giotto achieved great personal fame in his lifetime, which ended
in 1337. His works point to the innovations of the Renaissance
style that developed a century later.
</P>
<P>
   The Scrovegni Chapel's frescoes are considered his masterpiece.
Three years before he died, he started working on Florence's bell
tower which bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   Mallegni, an anthropology and paleontology professor at the
universities of Pisa and Palermo, said that he studied the bones
for three months.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the analyses portray Giotto as a short, squarely
built man, with a huge head and a hooked nose, Mallegni said. The
bones show signs of osteoporosis, confirming the theory that he
died quite old, perhaps at the age of 70.
</P>
<P>
   Also found on the skeleton were high levels of aluminum,
arsenic, zinc, lead and other chemical elements used in the colors
in the 14th century -- materials that Giotto's body ended up
absorbing during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the pieces in the jigsaw puzzle fit,'' Mallegni said.
</P>
<P>
   Bones of his neck show a contraction, suggesting that he spent a
lot of time looking upward, at his frescoes, the professor said.
Analyses of his teeth suggest that he used to hold the paintbrush
in his mouth while working.
</P>
<P>
   The research also indicates that he ate a lot of meat, a sign
that he was well off.
</P>
<P>
   Mallegni said that the skeleton was not well preserved. It was
found, along with 14th century coins, in a grave of the Church of
Santa Reparata, which was later replaced by the Duomo cathedral.
When Giotto died, Santa Reparata was still in use as the cathedral
was being built around it.
</P>
<P>
   The skeleton had been studied before, but could not be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Mallegni's theory has been received with some skepticism by
other Italian scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Art historian Alessandro Parronchi told the Milan daily Corriere
della Sera that the chalk reconstruction used is not realistic. He
also pointed out that the Scrovegni Chapel painting used for the
comparison may not be Giotto's self-portrait -- a long-standing
doubt that has divided experts.
</P>
<P>
   Others have said that the skeleton might belong to another
painter active in Florence in the 1300s.

<HEADLINE> Fears of Cheating in Yugoslav Vote  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- ''I will monitor the elections
because I care,'' says the young man on the billboard, urging
citizens to make sure there is no cheating Sunday when Yugoslavs
vote on whether to keep Slobodan Milosevic as president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like hell you will,'' says graffiti spray-painted on the ad.
</P>
<P>
   The billboard is sponsored by the Center for Free Elections and
Democracy, a reformist group. The graffiti, people here assume, is
the work of Milosevic supporters. The war of words sums up a
widespread fear: that no matter how many people vote against him,
Milosevic and his backers will find a way to claim victory.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the billboard's message is negated by a government
order banning monitors sent by the free-elections center from
entering polling stations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milosevic's regime has stolen years of our lives,'' said chief
Milosevic rival Vojislav Kostunica at a recent rally. ''And now
it's preparing the theft of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Since a multiparty system was introduced here 10 years ago,
independent monitors have recorded irregularities ranging from
muzzling media coverage of campaigning to outright
ballot-tampering.
</P>
<P>
   ''An array of poorly drafted laws facilitate election fraud,
which Serbian officials actively exploited'' in previous elections,
the New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pro-government parties dominate electoral commissions and
polling boards, making it difficult for the opposition to monitor
the use of a wide variety of techniques for manipulation,'' it
said.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the polls, Milosevic is on the ropes, with
Kostunica ahead by 10 percentage points or more. And Milosevic's
Socialist party is also expected to be outpolled by a coalition of
18 opposition parties in parliamentary balloting running parallel
to the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   This time, more is at stake than ever for Milosevic. Out of
office, he becomes more easily extraditable to the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague over atrocities against Kosovo's Albanians
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are working day and night to prepare against all the tricks
the regime used in past elections,'' said Nenad Milic, a legal
expert for the 18 allied opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   He said the opposition is sending supporters to the 10,000
polling stations across the country to monitor the voting. Each
station's returns must be certified by the monitors, but whether
the regime will abide by these rules is uncertain. Moreover, only
one independent monitor is allowed in each counting center, and he
or she may have difficulty keeping an eye on everything.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be the opposition's word against the Milosevic
camp's, since the government has barred various international
organizations from sending monitors. Only friendly countries are
welcome. NATO countries are banned, which rules out monitors from
most of the European and North American democracies.
</P>
<P>
   For trying to organize effective monitoring, the Center for Free
Elections and Democracy is branded a NATO outpost. Milosevic's camp
tries to link all its opponents to Yugoslavia's enemies, primarily
NATO, whose bombing campaign forced Milosevic to effectively give
up Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Police have ransacked several of the center's offices. Activists
have been detained, computers and files seized and dozens of
billboards vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   Milic points to NATO-controlled Kosovo as prime terrain for
possible cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Of Yugoslavia's 7.8 million eligible voters, more than 1 million
are ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo. They are expected to boycott
the election, but Milosevic's authorities claim they will organize
the vote there anyway. And since NATO and the United Nations say
they have no role in the voting, Milosevic's foes say he will have
a free hand to claim those million votes as his own.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly will not recognize the vote if the state claims
that thousands of Kosovo Albanians voted and supported Milosevic,''
Milic said.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Footwear on Display  </HEADLINE>

two-tone button-up spats worn by Warren Harding.
</P>
<P>
   They'll have an opportunity to view those shoes and others when

   Like the men who walked on them, each presidential foot has its
own quirks.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Johnson needed two different sizes -- 11 and 11 1/2 --
because one foot was larger than the other. Abraham Lincoln, whose
size 14 lace-up boots are on display, had the largest foot of any
president.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Ford, bowing to 1970s relaxed styles, wore scuffed,
casual brown chukka boots.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon preferred the
same style -- black wing tips with fancy scrollwork -- didn't
surprise Edmund Beard, a political science professor at the
university.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1968 campaign, Nixon's advisers told him he should
try to emulate Kennedy's style. Kennedy, during his time in office,
had been photographed on a Cape Cod beach with rolled-up pants and
bare feet, holding hands with his children.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon tried to stage a similar photo shoot at San Clemente,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nixon was photographed trying to be Kennedy, except -- it's
absolutely classic -- he couldn't take off his shoes and couldn't
roll up his pants,'' Beard said. ''So he was walking on the beach
in black wing-tip shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston &AMP; Murphy, the company that has made custom shoes for
every president since 1850, put together the Presidential Shoe
Collection.
</P>
<P>
   Though the company usually gives each president only one free
pair of custom-made shoes, they gave an extra pair -- size 13 blue
suede loafers -- to Bill Clinton in honor of his love for Elvis.
Clinton, incidentally, has the second-largest ''first feet.''
Johnson &AMP; Murphy spokesman Deanna Grubbs said the gift doesn't
reveal a political bias.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit will be in Boston until the day after the debate
between presidential candidates Gore and Bush. Then it will move to
New York for Election Day and Washington for the presidential
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's attracting the attention of college students who
never knew Harry Truman's no-nonsense style was reflected in his
plain black oxfords, or that Johnson's bunions required him to have
shoes made out of soft leather.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen anything like this in my life,'' freshman
David Crosby said. ''But I don't know if I can learn anything about
the presidents from their shoes. I'll stick with American history
classes to do that.''

<HEADLINE> Debates Can Be Subtle on Polls  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential debates can have a subtle,
important effect on a close race that sometimes has been difficult
to measure in the polls in past election years, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Debates can sway undecided and swing voters, and increase
enthusiasm and turnout among base supporters. They also can affect
campaign momentum or change a candidate's image -- for better or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Stromm, a 25-year-old graphic designer from Ypsilanti,
Mich., is the kind of voter who could be helped by the three
presidential debates scheduled for next month.
</P>
<P>
   She supported Republican John McCain in the Michigan
presidential primary. She is undecided about Democrat Al Gore or
Republican George W. Bush, but remembers that the 1996 debates led
her away from GOP nominee Bob Dole. ''He seemed unprepared,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stromm also wants to hear more about issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I'm looking to see if Gore is able to maintain that
new image,'' said Stromm, a Democrat. ''And Bush ... he looks kind
of shifty. I'd like to see if he can come across well. He came
across great on Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Ronald Reagan effectively used the debates to reassure
people who were concerned about his understanding of the issues.
Perceptions of his grasp of the issues rose after his first debate
with John Anderson, polls suggest, and that factor that could have
helped after his late October debate with President Carter. That
year, the polls shifted from a Carter edge before that debate to a
dead heat just before the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''The image the people had of Reagan was that they were not sure
of his ability and the image he portrayed was of an elder statesman
we could listen to and have some confidence in,'' said veteran
pollster Warren Mitofsky.
</P>
<P>
   Other years when debates are credited with playing a significant
role:
</P>
<P>
   -- 1960, when John F. Kennedy's poised demeanor on television
gave him a stature that some thought the young senator from
Massachusetts lacked, while Vice President Richard Nixon appeared
less comfortable with the new medium.
</P>
<P>
   -- 1976, when President Ford said Poland would never be dominated
by the Soviet Union. He later explained he meant their spirits
would never be dominated and never intended to dispute that the
Soviets had extensive military forces there. But his momentum to
catch up with Carter stalled after the debates.
</P>
<P>
   -- 1992, when Ross Perot's participation in the debates helped
elevate the Reform Party candidate's stature and probably helped
him get 19 percent of the vote. Bill Clinton won with just 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important roles the debates play, said
presidential scholar Charles Jones, is to confirm to voters that
their candidate ''is good enough that I'll turn out and vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald McElwaney, a Democrat and middle school teacher from
Saugus, Mass., said he'll watch just to see how his candidate,
Gore, performs. ''He has to show that he wasn't just a 'yes man,'
that he contributed to what's been going on the last eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Claasen, a 28-year-old Republican serving in the Army at
Fort Riley, Kansas, said he's ''hoping Gore screws it all up.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters give mixed reviews to surveys that say who won a
debate immediately after it's over. Some caution that such opinions
are ephemeral and tell little about the campaign. But Kathleen
Frankovic, director of surveys at CBS News, said they offer an
unvarnished public reaction before analysts, pundits and friends
and family weigh in.
</P>
<P>
   Even the perception of winning a debate doesn't ensure victory.
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, a little-known former congressman debated a
powerful senator running for re-election several times on the
issues of the day. The general consensus was that the senator did
best in the first debates, then was outperformed by his young
challenger, said David Zarefsky, a debate expert from Northwestern
University.
</P>
<P>
   The former congressman won the popular vote, but the senator won
re-election after state lawmakers decided the race, said Zarefsky,
who has written extensively about the debates.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1858, the top issue of the day was slavery, the
senator was Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln was the former
congressman.

<HEADLINE> Bush Seeks More Funds for Disease  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- In the heart of the Florida battleground
thick with senior voters, George W. Bush was proposing to spend $67
billion over a decade on a ''medical moonshot'' to boost the public
and private search for cures of fatal diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The figure includes $35 billion already in the Republican
presidential candidate's budget. It also includes increasing the
budget of the National Cancer Institute to $5.1 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will fund and lead a medical moonshot to reach far beyond
what seems possible today and discover new cures for age-old
afflictions,'' Bush said in remarks prepared for his appearance
Friday at a Sun City, Fla., senior center. ''If I am elected
president, our government will promote medical advances with new
resources and new resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   The appearance caps a campaign week in which Bush used each day
to discuss how his proposals would affect voters at every stage of
life. It is part of a new approach in which he seeks to explain his
agenda on more personal terms in an effort to keep up with
Democratic rival Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to let Al Gore scare senior citizens into
voting for him,'' Bush told a Republican fund-raiser Thursday night
in Nashville, Tenn. -- Gore's base of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore running mate Joseph Lieberman also was campaigning in
Florida on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors are an especially active and liberal-leaning voting
group, particularly in Florida, which is governed by Bush's brother
Jeb and a Republican Legislature. Bush had long considered the
state in his column, but he and Gore are now statistically tied in
the race for its 25 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's visit is Bush's second in two weeks, underscoring the
campaign's concern about its prospects there.
</P>
<P>
   During a swing that also includes stops Friday in Sarasota,
Tampa and Miami, he will propose to:
</P>
<P>
   -- Increase funding by $32 billion over the $35 billion already
proposed for the National Institutes of Health. He said the
Clinton-Gore administration has proposed about half that amount.
</P>
<P>
   -- Make permanent a tax credit for private research and
development into disease cures and prevention, costing $24 billion
over 10 years. Bush, who already had proposed the expenditure, said
the Clinton administration has never suggested making it permanent.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bush focused on allowing younger workers to invest
a small portion of the payroll taxes that fund Social Security in
equity or bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   This would create ''a powerful nest egg,'' Bush told workers at
a Cleveland company that makes cooling equipment for computers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign has said the program would amount to a $1
trillion drain on the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   After a ''one-on-one'' meeting Saturday with Orlando citizens,
Bush heads home to Texas for a day of rest. He begins a five-day,
West Coast campaign swing on Monday that will include California,
which is leaning toward Gore.
</P>
<P>
   That trip will end with several days of preparation for his
first debate with Gore on Oct. 3 in Boston.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Wraps Up Week of Campaigning  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTERFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Dick Cheney is wrapping up a week of
campaigning in battleground states punctuated by a steady stream of
attacks on Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP vice presidential candidate will visit a senior center
in Iowa on Friday to talk up George W. Bush's plan to help elderly
Americans pay for their prescriptions. He also plans to stop in
Omaha before flying to Washington, where he'll spend part of next
week preparing for an Oct. 5 debate with Democratic Sen. Joe
Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney kept up a steady stream of attacks on Gore during a
campaign tour that took him through states that Republicans and
Democrats consider up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday in California he criticized what he said was Gore's
hypocrisy on Hollywood. Wednesday in New Mexico he said the vice
president and his boss have damaged the military. Thursday in
Missouri was the day to blame Gore's energy policy for higher fuel
prices.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit of a new twist for Cheney, initially viewed as the
man who would help George W. Bush shore up the Republican base by
shadowing the Texas governor through tossup states and highlighting
Bush's proposals for tax cuts, strengthening the military and
overhauling Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Cheney is doing that. But now that Gore has erased a
double-digit deficit in national polls by pulling even or slightly
ahead of Bush in the polls, Cheney is increasingly taking on the
more traditional role of a running mate, albeit in a statesmanlike
manner.
</P>
<P>
   Where Bush will shout -- ''They have not led! We will!'' -- Cheney
is more likely to say he's ''disappointed'' by Gore's rhetoric or
call his proposals ''unfortunate'' or deliver the following type of
somber criticism with hands folded in front of him:
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what we find difficult is to engage in the debate when
the vice president clearly is prepared to, in effect, make things
up from whole cloth in terms of coming up with examples to
demonstrate his point of view,'' he said Wednesday of Gore's tale
about the difference in price for the same arthritis medicine for
his mother-in-law and aging dog.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was more succinct Thursday in Missouri, chastising Gore
for overseeing an energy policy that he says has helped drive up
gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is ''running around the country, waving his arms, pointing
the finger of blame at everybody else,'' Cheney said, pounding his
fist on the podium and waving a finger for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   He played down the change in tone when asked about it. ''Just
pointing out the contrasts between our approach and the Gore
approach, I think that's fair game,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Giants 8, Diamondbacks 7  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Giants clinched their second NL West
title in four years, getting a go-ahead sacrifice fly from Russ
Davis in the eighth inning Thursday night to beat the Arizona
Diamondbacks 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Burks hit a two-run homer and drove in three runs for San
Francisco, which twice overcame two-run deficits to eliminate the
Diamondbacks, their last rival for the division title.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants (92-60) have won 18 of 22 to forge the best record in
the major leagues and the best home record at 54-23.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, which opened the season 3-9 and trailed Arizona
by nine games on May 28, pulled away from the NL West
defending-champion Diamondbacks in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has lost six straight games, dropping to 6-13 in
September to put manager Buck Showalter's job in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   After Robb Nen retired Jay Bell on a game-ending fly out to
center, the Giants poured out of the dugout to congratulate each
other while the crowd at Pacific Bell Park cheered and waved
towels. The ballpark opened in April and has been sold out for
every game.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's players sat silently on their dugout bench.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco will open the playoffs Oct. 2 or 3 against a team
to be determined. The Giants haven't won a World Series title since
1954, when they played in New York's Polo Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Henry (4-4) pitched two hitless innings for the victory.
Nen pitched the ninth for his 39th save in 44 opportunities but
allowed a run for the first time since July 13.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Tony Womack led off the ninth with a single, and
Danny Bautista brought him home with a two-out double off the wall
in right. But Bell's long fly to center was caught by Marvin
Benard, and catcher Bobby Estalella grabbed Nen in a triumphant hug
as fireworks and water cannons exploded in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Nen has converted 26 straight save chances and hadn't allowed a
run in his previous 27 appearances, a span of 26 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 6-all, J.T. Snow led off the eighth with a double
against Mike Morgan (5-4) and Burks reached first with an infield
single. One out later, pinch-hitter Davis' fly to deep center
scored Snow and touched off a celebration in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Burks then scored on Felipe Crespo's infield single against Dan
Plesac to make it 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   Burks and Doug Mirabelli had RBI singles that tied the game at 6
in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Miller had a two-run double and Bautista had a two-run
triple for the Diamondbacks, who were shut out in their previous
two games but scored six runs against Giants starter Kirk Rueter.
</P>
<P>
   Bautista's two-run triple in the third was Arizona's first hit
against Rueter. It also snapped a franchise-record scoreless streak
of 21 1-3 innings for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona starter Todd Stottlemyre allowed four runs, including
Burks' homer in the fourth, and left after the fourth. He strained
his right hamstring on a pitch to Snow, and though he finished the
inning, Greg Swindell came in to start the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   After his sixth-inning double, Miller left for a pinch-runner,
and the team said he sprained his right foot on his first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kent's double in the first inning scored Barry Bonds from
first base and gave Kent 125 RBIs, three shy of his career high,
set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Burks received the Giants' Willie Mac award as San
Francisco's most inspirational player. Hall of Famer Willie McCovey
presented the award. ... The start was briefly delayed for a
three-song concert by the Baha Men, the musical group behind the
current sports stadium hit ''Who Let the Dogs Out?'' Players from
both teams stood bemusedly in their dugouts watching the
performance by the nine-member band in the infield, six of whom
wore Giants jerseys.

<HEADLINE> Weightlifter Haworth Wins Bronze  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Cheryl Haworth, the 17-year-old Georgia
high school senior who began lifting weights to build up her arm
for softball, got the bronze medal Friday in Olympic 165
pounds-plus women's weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
   Ding Meiyuan of China broke world records in the snatch, the
clean and jerk and total lift to win the gold medal, totaling 661&AMP;frac14;
pounds to edge 19-year-old Agata Wrobel of Poland by 11 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Ding-Wrobel-Haworth finish was exactly the same as in the
world championships last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ding and Wrobel took turns breaking Chinese lifter Wang Yanmei's
previous world record of 354&AMP;frac12; pounds in the clean and jerk before
Ding hit her final lift of 363&AMP;frac34; pounds and Wrobel missed her's --
for the gold medal -- of 373&AMP;frac34; pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ding's total broke Wrobel's record of 639&AMP;frac14; pounds set July 8 in
Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Haworth lifted an American-record 275&AMP;frac12; pounds in the snatch and
matched her personal best by lifting 319&AMP;frac12; pounds in the clean and
jerk for a total of 595 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ding and Wrobel also each broke the snatch record before the
Chinese lifter finished with 297&AMP;frac12; pounds. Wrobel put up 292 pounds,
more than her previous record of 286&AMP;frac12; pounds also set in July.
</P>
<P>
   Haworth's medal was the second for the United States in
weightlifting since 1984, and the second in these games.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Nott initially took the silver at 105 pounds on Sunday,
then was awarded the gold Friday when Bulgaria's Izabela Dragneva
was stripped of the medal for using a banned drug.
</P>
<P>
   Haworth was the last of the four U.S. women to lift in Sydney;
neither 105-pounder Robin Goad nor 165-pounder Cara Heads-Lane got
a medal.
</P>
<P>
   That Haworth is at the Olympics at such a relatively young age
is remarkable in itself. Like Nott, she didn't start lifting until
after the 1996 Atlanta Games, yet already holds all American
records.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Zlatan Vanev had been favored to give Bulgaria its
second consecutive gold medal in men's weightlifting at 170 pounds
(77 kg) Friday, following Galabin Boevski's victory Wednesday at
152 pounds (69 kg). But Vanev lost his chance to compete when
Bulgaria was banned from the rest of the weightlifting for its drug
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Chaplin III, like Haworth also of Savannah, did not match
any of his American records Friday while lifting in the ''B'' group
at 170 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin lifted 341&AMP;frac12; pounds (155kg) in the snatch, off his U.S.
record of 346&AMP;frac12; pounds (157.5 kg), and 396&AMP;frac34; pounds (180 kg) in the
clean and jerk, off his national mark of 412&AMP;frac12; pounds (187.5 kg) set
while winning the world junior championships. His total lift of
738&AMP;frac12; pounds (335 kg) put him in the lower half of the 12 lifters in
the ''B'' group.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Chaplin nearly lifted 418&AMP;frac34; pounds (190 kg) in
the clean and jerk, but stumbled slightly as he was raising the bar
above his head and could not finish. He missed a second attempt at
the same weight, barely getting the bar off the floor before
dropping it.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin's placement was to be determined after the ''A'' group
lifters competed later Friday.

<HEADLINE> US Gets Weightlifting Gold Medal  </HEADLINE>
By TED ANTHONY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The United States got its first
weightlifting gold medal since 1960 after two Bulgarian lifters
were stripped of their medals and thrown out of the Olympics on
Friday after testing positive for a banned drug.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bulgaria's entire weightlifting team was thrown out
of the Sydney Olympics and suspended from international competition
for 12 months, the International Weightlifting Federation
announced.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in 12 years that Bulgarian lifters have
been ejected from an Olympics for using the banned weight-losing
drug, and the positive tests cast uncertainty upon the very future
of the sport in the games.
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee said Friday that gold
medalist Izabela Dragneva -- the first women's weightlifting
champion in Olympic history -- and men's bronze medalist Sevdalin
Minchev tested positive for banned diuretics at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the women's gold medal will go to Tara Nott of
Stilwell, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Dragneva and Minchev were the second and third Bulgarian lifters
found with the banned drug furosemide in their systems at these
games. Both were ordered to return their medals and leave the
Olympic Village.
</P>
<P>
   ''When athletes are using this product, they are getting
stupid,'' said Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC
Medical Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ouster decision was announced, IWF secretary general
Tamas Ajan said the ''three-strikes-and-out'' rule would be applied
to the Bulgarian team unless it decided to pay a $50,000 fine. The
IWF then met with Bulgarian Olympic officials and announced the
ouster.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will plan to have them expelled regardless of the $50,000
fine,'' said IWF vice president Sam Coffa. ''They have brought the
sport of weightlifting into worthless repute.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltcho Ivanov, secretary general of the Bulgarian national
Olympic committee, said Dragneva and Minchev were tested when they
entered the Olympic Village and no problems were detected. They
both tested positive after the competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is impossible our athletes took this drug because it is
very primitive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The IWF said that ''in light of the three positive tests
recorded by Bulgarian weightlifters at these Olympic Games and
further to their disqualification by the IOC, the IWF executive
board, being conscious of its responsibilities ... suspends the
Bulgarian Weightlifting Federation forthwith for a period of not
less than 12 months, pending further investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All remaining lifters as well as officials from Bulgaria will
not be allowed to take part in the Olympic Games,'' the IWF
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulgarians could have paid a $50,000 fine and stayed in the
games. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said the fine, if it
had been paid, would be used to fight doping in Bulgaria. He would
not directly address weightlifting's future in the games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are doing what we have to do,'' Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
   IOC Director General Francois Carrard, meanwhile, warned against
tarring every Bulgarian weightlifter because of the actions of a
few. ''We always have to be very careful in making the distinction
between clean athletes and cheats,'' he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The sanction means Nott, who finished second, gets the gold
medal in the women's class. Informed of her gold medal, Nott said
she was ''kind of in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good to know that those who cheat are getting caught,''
she said. ''Someday we will have a level playing field, and myself
and others will be able to win on the platform rather than after a
drug test.''
</P>
<P>
   New medal ceremonies were held Friday in the Olympic Village,
although Nott attended the weightlifting competition to cheer on
her teammates. Nott's gold is the first for an American lifter
since Chuck Vinci won the 123-pound title at the Rome Games 40
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bulgarian lifter Ivan Ivanov was stripped of his
silver medal in the 123-pound class after testing positive for
furosemide. Ivanov, a former Olympic and world champion, was the
first athlete to fail an in-competition test during the games.
</P>
<P>
   Johann Olav Koss, an athlete member of the medical commission,
said the IOC must consider the overall Bulgarian weightlifting
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have three cases for the same drug in the same sport from
the same country,'' he said. ''That's the big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Bulgaria was stripped of two
weightlifting gold medals and subsequently withdrew its entire
weightlifting team after athletes tested positive for furosemide.
</P>
<P>
   Such diuretics are used to lose weight but also can be used to
mask the presence of other performance-enhancing drugs, such as
steroids. The most commonly used diuretic is caffeine, which also
is on the banned list.
</P>
<P>
   Dragneva, 28, won the gold medal in the women's 105-pound event,
in which Nott originally won the silver. Minchev, 26, took the
bronze in the men's 137-pound class in which Gennady Oleshchuk of
Belarus finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Two Romanian weightlifters, Traian Ciharean and Adrian Mateas,
were suspended and expelled from the Olympic Village after failing
out-of-competition tests.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has conducted 760 doping tests at competition sites so
far, in addition to 227 off-site blood tests and 323 off-site urine
tests, Carrard said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he would not comment on weightlifting's future, he said
the IOC would discuss the situation with the federation ''quietly
after the games.''
</P>
<P>
   IOC vice president Dick Pound said he hoped it would not mean
the end of Olympic weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each positive test is a success rather than a failure,'' he
said. But ''I would hate to see the sport dropped from the program
unless it's clear that nobody is going to do anything about the
problem.''

<HEADLINE> Nurse faces sentence for attempted sex abuse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A registered nurse admitted trying to
perform a sexual act on a patient without her consent.
</P>
<P>
   David W. Miller, 44, pleaded guilty Thursday to attempted
first-degree sodomy for attempting to perform oral sex on a patient
at the Rochester Psychiatric Center.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe County Court Judge Elma A. Bellini ordered that Miller be
taken in custody until his sentencing. He had been free on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was originally charged with first-degree sodomy and
first-degree sexual abuse, which could have put him in prison for
up to 15 years. But the victim agreed to his plea to a lesser
charge so she wouldn't have to testify, said Assistant District
Attorney Leanne K. Moser.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has been a nurse since 1990. The psychiatric center fired
him in March after his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The state Education Department's Office of the Professions,
which licenses nurses, is expected to hear disciplinary charges
against Miller that could lead to his license revocation, Moser
said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 11.

<HEADLINE> Volleyball: Russia 3, Germany 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Russia battled back from an 18-10
deficit to square its match with Germany, then cruised in the final
game to pull out a grueling 23-25, 25-23, 14-25, 28-26, 15-6
victory Friday in women's volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which also took five games to defeat Cuba, improved to
4-0 in Group B, but not without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, whose only international victory over Russia came in a
1995 exhibition, dominated the third game to take a 2-1 lead. In
the fourth, the Germans ran off five straight points for a 9-6
edge, and kept building toward a huge upset.
</P>
<P>
   The lead reached 22-16 before the Russians finally came to life.
With fiery coach Nikolai Karpol staying unusually calm, Russia ran
off four straight points until Yevgenia Artamonova stroked a serve
long.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans had a 24-21 lead, but they couldn't put it away. A
bad set by Susanne Lahme put Russia up 27-26, and Lyubov Chachkova
got the winner on a perfect smash to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   Germany (1-3) had nothing left in the fifth set, falling behind
6-1 and never recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Artamanova had 19 kills to lead Russia, and Hanka Pachale had 20
for Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Russia wraps up Group B play on Sunday against South Korea in
what will be the biggest size mismatch of the tournament. The
Russians average about 6 feet-2&AMP;frac12; per player, while the South
Koreans average 5-9&AMP;frac12;.

<HEADLINE> Blatter Contradicts Samaranch  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter isn't quite
ready to offer the ''best athletes'' in soccer for future Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the international soccer federation on Friday had a
different view of Olympic eligibility than IOC president Juan
Antonio Samaranch. Last week, Samaranch said he had met with
Blatter and was given assurances that an earlier date for the 2004
Games would guarantee ''all the great players'' would compete.
</P>
<P>
   ''The facts are that every year we have contact with the IOC,
and our last contact was in February,'' Blatter said. ''Mr.
Samaranch wants to have in the Olympics the best athletes. We said
let us see what happens in Sydney, and discuss it after that.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does not look good if you have teams with different
formats, if some use under-23 players in total and others add two
or three players over the age of 23. For consistency, you should
start and end with the same principle. This is what I would
advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has been pushing FIFA to scrap or liberalize its
under-23 age restriction for the Olympics since it was instituted
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most powerful soccer confederations have resisted the
move to more open Olympic eligibility: South America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   After a bitter war of words in which the IOC threatened to throw
soccer out of the Olympics and FIFA threatened to withdraw, each
qualified team was given the option of supplementing its roster
with three overage players in 1996. That same rule is in effect in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 16 qualified teams for 2000 chose not to supplement
their rosters with overage players, and others sent only one, not
three.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA general secretary Michel Zen-Ruffinen two weeks ago said
soccer's world body will discuss Olympic age eligibility at its
year-end stragetic study meeting, including the IOC suggestion to
increase the overage player limit to five.
</P>
<P>
   But Blatter seemed to dismiss any increase in the current status
by noting that Athens organizers strongly indicated an
unwillingness to change the Aug. 13-29 schedule for the 2004
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are happy with what we have witnessed here,'' Blatter said.
''The quality is excellent. There are no more weak teams, and we
knew that for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The level of the 23 and youth talent is already there, and
also the coaches and the tactical side. Few teams are using three
players over 23.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the five teams that brought no player over 23, three are from
Europe: Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic. Spain and Italy face
each other in Saturday's quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil and Honduras are the other two; Brazil also made the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, CONMEBOL president Nicolas Leoz said earlier this
year that preparing teams was becoming too costly and Sydney would
be the last Olympics with South American teams.
</P>
<P>
   Blatter indicated the CONMEBOL threat was not sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you ask the players if they would like to go, or not go, to
the Olympics, I'm sure all the players and the national
associations will go if they qualify,'' Blatter said. ''Perhaps
this is an attempt to obtain something.''

<HEADLINE> Pac Bell Celebrates as Giants Win  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The fans at Pacific Bell Park didn't panic
when the San Francisco Giants fell behind on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   They just pulled their coats tighter, waved their towels a
little harder, and waited for the Giants to come back.
</P>
<P>
   From team owner Peter Magowan in the front row to the fans
peering through the free viewing area in right field, just about
everybody in attendance seemed to feel a sense of destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' 77th sellout crowd of the season saw San Francisco
clinch the NL West title with an 8-7 victory over Arizona. Fans
kept warm in swirling winds and cool temperatures by waving
souvenir towels and screaming at the top of their lungs for a team
that has suddenly developed a serious home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   When Marvin Benard squeezed Jay Bell's fly ball for the final
out, the new park erupted. Fans stood, cheered and sang for more
than 15 minutes after the Giants left the field.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the Giants returned, spraying everyone with
champagne and throwing hats and T-shirts into the crowd while Tony
Bennett's ''I Left My Heart in San Francisco'' played on the
stadium sound system.
</P>
<P>
   It was another celebratory night for the city of San Francisco
in what's starting to seem like a charmed year for the Giants. The
franchise opened a spectacular new ballpark in the same season
their pitching staff came together and Barry Bonds led a breakout
year by the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're in the postseason for the first time since 1997,
looking for their franchise's first World Series title since 1954,
when they still played in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''For our city, for our first year in a new ballpark, you
couldn't have a better script than the one we're living out right
now,'' manager Dusty Baker said. ''How many times in your life do
you get an opportunity to do all the things we're doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Not very often. The Giants are heading to the playoffs for just
the second time in eight seasons under Baker, who remembers games
early in his managerial tenure when 5,000 fans or fewer were in the
stands at Candlestick Park.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco fans barely had time to get used to the idea of a
winning club in 1997, when the Giants unexpectedly won the division
title after three straight sub-.500 seasons. Florida knocked them
out of the playoffs in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   But San Francisco's current season is unfolding better than even
Magowan could have imagined. He bought the Giants in 1992 and led
the development of Pac Bell, which was built entirely with private
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were just thrilled to be in the playoffs in '97,'' Magowan
said. ''This year, we expected to win, and a lot of us look at this
as just the first leg. We've got a lot we still want to
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have the majors' best home record, improving to 54-23
with the victory. Many players give credit to a resurgence in fan
support at Pac Bell, where the Giants have a vocal home-field
advantage after years of playing in front of mellow California
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   That support was evident again on Thursday, when fans came to
Pac Bell wearing everything from tank tops to winter coats in the
Bay Area's unpredictable weather.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, they watched a mini-concert by a rock group and
gave a standing ovation to Hall of Famer Willie McCovey, who
presented his Willie Mac Award to Ellis Burks as the team's most
inspirational player.

<HEADLINE> Genesee Brewing to erect life-size horses in Rochester  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - The Genesee Brewing Co. has proposed
placing 150 life-size fiberglass horse sculptures throughout parts
of this city.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials on Thursday unveiled the ''Horses on Parade''
project as a way to reintroduce the 122-year-old company to
Rochester. The project will begin in May.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Chicago, Toronto, New York City and New Orleans
the artsy animal replicas have drawn tourists and traffic to
downtown businesses, while encouraging public interest in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not try to hide the fact that the project is part
of a marketing plan to sell more beer in the Rochester region.
</P>
<P>
   During the past five years, Genesee sales have declined by more
than 20 percent amid continued operating losses.
</P>
<P>
   With sponsors for each of the horses, Genesee is promising at
least $25,000 for five Rochester-area charities, and possibly
thousands more upon the auction of the sculptures.

<HEADLINE> Lester Novros, film technology pioneer who taught George Lucas, dead at 91 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Lester Novros, a pioneer of large format film
technology and University of Southern California film professor
whose students included ''Star Wars'' director George Lucas, has
died at age 91.
</P>
<P>
   Novros, who died Sept. 10, was nominated for an Academy Award
for best documentary for his 1972 film ''Universe.'' He also worked
on Stanley Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece ''2001: A Space Odyssey,''
which won an Oscar for special effects.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first time I truly understood the unique quality of film
was when I took Les Novros' class,'' Lucas wrote in an introduction
to the textbook Novros fashioned from his lectures at USC from 1941
to 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The professor also wrote, directed and produced some of the
earliest Imax/Omnimax Films for the Reuben H. Fleet Space Center in
San Diego's Balboa Park, including ''Voyage to the Outer Planets,''
''Cosmos'' and ''Tomorrow in Space.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, he produced stunning specialty films for various
government and commercial pavilions at the 1964 World's Fair in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Novros' 70mm film ''To the Moon and Beyond'' for
Cinerama Corp. that caught Kubrick's eye and led to his work on
''2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   The native of Passaic, N.J., studied at the National Academy of
Design and the Art Students League in New York and the Prado Museum
in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Los Angeles in 1936 when Walt Disney Studios
recruited him to work on animated features. He helped with ''Snow
White'' and earned a credit for art direction for ''Night on Bald
Mountain.''

<HEADLINE> Peru Opposition Wants Fair Election  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A skeptical opposition is demanding that
President Alberto Fujimori guarantee a free and fair election of
his successor, expressing doubts about his stated plans to lead his
own transition from power.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charged Thursday that Fujimori, accused of using
dictatorial powers to rule this poor Andean nation for a decade,
appeared bent on setting the stage for an eventual comeback.
</P>
<P>
   His government beset by a fast-exploding corruption scandal,
Fujimori stunned Peru on Saturday by saying he would call a special
election but not be a candidate. He later said he would remain
firmly in charge until a July 28 change of power amid opposition
calls for the immediate creation of a transitional government.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the quell speculation they were preparing a coup, the
commanders of Peru's army, air force, navy and police on Thursday
issued a communique saying they supported Fujimori's decision to
call new elections and deactivate the National Intelligence
Service, Peru's feared spy agency.
</P>
<P>
   As the crisis dragged on, hundreds of anti-government
demonstrators gathered outside the presidential palace late
Thursday, shouting slogans against Fujimori in a second straight
night of drum-banging protests.
</P>
<P>
   One group briefly scuffled with a rival band sympathetic to
Fujimori when they tried to unfurl a banner. A boy also was taken
away bleeding from an army after witnesses said he apparently was
hit by a bottle rocket. No other incidents were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, edgy riot police pushed and shoved some 50
anti-government demonstrators away from the palace after the women
used spray cans to douse police with foam and liquids.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to fumigate the palace. We are spraying them to get
the rats out of the palace,'' said Elsie Guerrero, a leader of a
group that routinely uses tubs to wash the national flag in the
plaza in a symbolic cleansing of Peru's ''dirty laundry.''
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo, who emerged from obscurity this year to mount
the only serious challenge to Fujimori's unprecedented third
election, insisted Fujimori must step down immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''How do we, as Peruvians, return Peru to democracy and the rule
of law?'' said Toledo, a U.S.-trained economist. He said a
transition government led by an impartial figure ''will conduct
elections with utmost transparency.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's announcement came days after the release of a
videotape purportedly showing security chief Vladimiro Montesinos
bribing an opposition congressman to defect to Fujimori's ranks.
Fujimori and his supporters have long denied they used bribes and
strong-arm tactics to regain control of the 120-seat Congress when
he lost his majority there in an election earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Political commentator Fernando Tuesta said Fujimori was intent
on tightly controlling the transition and shouldn't be counted out
for a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think Fujimori is the kind of person who will just go
off and write his memoirs or give international conferences,'' said
Tuesta, noting Fujimori's own suggestions he intends to remain
highly active in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fujimori wants to assure he is controlling the transition,''
said Tuesta, a sociologist. ''He wants a transition conducted
through official channels: through his cabinet, his congress, his
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has even hinted he would seek another five-year term in
2006. Asked about his future at a news conference Tuesday, he
laughed and said, ''I've got a little surprise for you about what
I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper, La Republica, had a headline declaring ''I'm
going, but I'm staying.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Peruvian commentator, Mirko Lauer, said Fujimori is a
master at political strategy and could already be working to
consolidate his power base. The government has said it will seek a
March election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe what Fujimori is trying to do right now is lay the
groundwork where the government can win with a second-rate
candidate who isn't as good as Fujimori but strong enough to take
on Toledo,'' said Lauer, a columnist for La Republica.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't name names, but added: ''The strategy seems rather
clear: divide the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be hard, given the historical division within the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori also may seek a constitutional reform to bar immediate
re-election of the president. Such a change is sought by the
opposition, but observers note it would guarantee Fujimori could
return and run for office without having to face a sitting and
potentially popular incumbent.

<HEADLINE> Eastwood Takes the Stand in ADA Case  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN BERGSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Trying to persuade a jury to make his
day, Clint Eastwood said he wanted to make a hotel he owns
accessible to the disabled but was constrained by his need to
preserve the property's historic character.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood testified for more than two hours Thursday in a federal
lawsuit brought against him by a woman with muscular dystrophy.
Diane zum Brunnen, 51, claims the actor-director's Mission Ranch
just outside Carmel was not fully accessible to her wheelchair. She
is seeking unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood, who harshly criticized the case in a congressional
hearing in May, was calm and almost soft-spoken as he told of how
he spent millions renovating the 150-year-old former dairy farm he
bought in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought it would be possible to comply with the
Americans with Disabilities Act and similar California laws while
still preserving the historic flavor of the property.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because it is an old place, we had a certain obligation to the
heritage and antique value, not just the ADA,'' Eastwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Zum Brunnen's attorney, John Burris, asked Eastwood whether he
developed any expertise in construction codes as mayor of Carmel
from 1986 to 1988 and as a film director who had sets built.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood, 70, said he was familiar with building regulations but
didn't consider himself an expert. He said he delegated the details
of the renovations of Mission Ranch to a contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Zum Brunnen claims her rights were violated when she and her
husband had dinner at the hotel in 1996. Among their complaints:
The wheelchair-accessible bathroom for Mission Ranch's restaurant
was more than 200 feet away, across a driveway; the lone guest room
for the disabled was $225, when other rooms were as low as $85; and
there was no ramp to the main office.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood acknowledges the problems but says he was not given a
fair chance to improve access at Mission Ranch before he was sued.
He supports a bill in Congress that would let property owners be
notified of alleged ADA violations before lawsuits could be filed.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from Burris, Eastwood said a wheelchair ramp
could have been added to the office as far back as 1992, when other
work was being done.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were so busy restoring and repairing the place,'' Eastwood
said, explaining why a ramp wasn't added. ''This is an ongoing
process and it's an ongoing process today.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood attorney Chuck Keller says the zum Brunnens cannot
prove they went to Mission Ranch on the day they allege and if they
did, they went merely to find grounds for a lawsuit. He pointed out
that the couple had also filed a complaint against another hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In zum Brunnen's time on the stand Thursday, Keller asked her to
explain inconsistencies in her testimony and pretrial depositions,
especially about the timing of a picture they say they took to show
the office did not have a ramp.

<HEADLINE> Antipoverty Bill Loaded With Pork  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A glut of senators' amendments is threatening
House-passed legislation to revive inner cities and impoverished
rural areas, but sponsors say some version of the bill remains
likely to be signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this process, you just have to be patient. It can be very
frustrating,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., one of the key
authors of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   From molasses tariffs to protect Louisiana sugar growers to tax
credits East Coast senators want for Amtrak, senators are clamoring
to attach at least 73 amendments to a ''community renewal'' bill
put together by President Clinton and House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has become a vehicle everyone knows is going to get signed
into law,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee. ''It's going to have a deluge of
amendments in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 10-year cost of the bill had swelled from $17
billion when it passed the House this summer to $28.7 billion by
Tuesday, when Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth,
R-Del., released a version with new tax credits for Amtrak and
companies providing high-speed Internet access in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, Roth was ready to propose a measure costing about
$37 billion with others items sought by individual senators. But a
Finance Committee session Thursday to vote on it was canceled
because of fights over how the pie is to be divided, leaving the
entire effort in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to finalize it before the end of the year,'' said
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ''But we all have to
give and take to reach this goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed bill includes a package of provisions to spur
capital investment in low-income areas, including Clinton's ''New
Markets'' initiative creating 10 venture capital firms to invest in
small businesses in poor neighborhoods and an expansion of
''empowerment zones'' where tax breaks and regulatory relief apply.
It would also expand the low-income housing credit and magnify tax
breaks for reclamation of ''brownfield'' industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the logjam, senators and their aides say, is
frustration from both Democrats and Republicans who face a
dwindling number of legislative days in this Congress and few ways
of getting their priority projects through the process.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said he persuaded
Roth to include a number of farm-related tax items in the bill,
some of them vetoed by Clinton earlier this year, as part of a bill
that would have repealed federal inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   These include tax-deductible savings accounts for up to 20
percent of a farmer's income, expanding bonds for state-sponsored
loans to beginning farmers and modifying a tax credit for biomass
energy to include wood chips and untreated construction debris.
</P>
<P>
   ''Biomass facilities are making a valuable contribution to a
cleaner environment, but we have left them in a financially
precarious position without favorable tax treatment,'' Grassley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators wanted one more crack at getting Clinton to sign
Republican tax bills he has already vetoed this year, including the
estate repeal and marriage penalty tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Others proposed expanding spending programs. For example,
Grassley and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., want to permit
low-income families to keep severely disabled children on Medicaid
even if their earnings rise above the program's limits.
</P>
<P>
   One key disagreement involved Roth, who is in a tough
re-election fight against Delaware Gov. Tom Carper. His proposed
new Amtrak tax credits -- important to Northeast states like
Delaware -- are vehemently opposed by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who
says the railroad would be ''double-dipping'' into the U.S.
Treasury because they already are getting transportation trust fund
money.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides are working amicably toward a solution,'' said
Michael Siegel, spokesman for Baucus.

<HEADLINE> Dems Offer Scaled-Down Land Proposal  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the new fiscal year just nine days off,
White House and congressional budget negotiators are stuffing
billions of dollars into spending bills and discussing creating a
new land conservation program.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides still have miles to go before they can
complete the 11 remaining spending measures for fiscal 2001, which
starts Oct. 1. Among the remaining hurdles are provisions lawmakers
have included on forest management and one barring the Clinton
administration from even considering removing four dams from the
Snake River in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again, too many of these bills are being watered down and
polluted with riders aimed at weakening public health protections,
blocking commonsense efforts to combat climate change and
surrendering public lands to private interest,'' President Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've vetoed bills before because they contained them and if I
have to, I'll do it again,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's combative tone, House and Senate lawmakers met
with White House officials Thursday evening and expressed interest
in a Democratic proposal to set aside up to $1.4 billion annually
for six years to buy and maintain land for federal and local parks,
beginning next year. Nothing would be spent without the approval of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was smaller than a measure the House had approved
overwhelmingly with Clinton's support that called for spending $3
billion annually for 15 years. But it was far larger than anything
GOP budget bargainers had signaled they would accept, and they said
they liked the discretion it would give Congress in spending the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, an author of the Interior Department
spending bill to which the lands program would be attached, said he
had told House leaders about the proposal and they had not
objected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a get-out-of-here mode,'' Regula said, referring to
the effort by congressional leaders to complete the spending work
so lawmakers can campaign at home for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   With presidential and congressional elections less than seven
weeks away, GOP leaders were not relishing any prolonged battles
over the environment, an issue on which the public tends to favor
Democrats. Clinton's insistence on money for obtaining parklands
has been one of the White House's top-tier demands.
</P>
<P>
   All but certain that the spending bills will not be finished in
time -- and with no taste for a federal shutdown -- lawmakers planned
to approve a measure keeping federal agencies open through Oct. 6
while negotiations continue, according to GOP aides who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders were hoping a compromise Interior bill would be
ready for floor action next week. Its price tag was soaring past
$18 billion -- more than $3 billion higher than this year's level --
and the White House was still insisting on about $200 million more
for Indian health, energy, national monuments and arts programs,
participants said.
</P>
<P>
   That measure provided just one example of the billions in added
spending that Clinton and lawmakers of both parties were winning in
talks on the bills.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., was getting language into
the transportation spending bill that would give a high priority to
five Chicago-area mass transit projects whose federal cost totals
$850 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., was seeking language that would
provide at least $70 million to buttress ailing pension funds that
provide health care for 60,000 coal miners.
</P>
<P>
   And bargainers on a separate measure financing energy and water
programs were nearing agreement on adding roughly $2 billion to the
measure above the $22 billion the House approved, including dozens
of new projects.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House and Senate leaders were searching for a way to
revive a $33 billion measure financing the Treasury Department and
Congress itself -- and providing lawmakers with a $3,800 pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate roundly rejected the measure on Wednesday, a week
after it had been approved by the House.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders were considering providing extra money for the
Internal Revenue Service and counterterrorism programs that Clinton
was demanding on a separate measure financing the Interior
Department, and pushing both bills through Congress, Senate
Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., said.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Report: Racism Still in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN S. GOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Racism is still at large in the United States,
according to a new federal study, and it is visible in the
differences between blacks and whites in income, incarceration
rates and access to education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released Thursday, is an analysis of U.S. compliance
with an international treaty on eliminating racism. It finds the
nation's laws comply with the treaty, but that American society
does not fully embrace its spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not yet met the challenge of creating a colorblind
society,'' said Harold Hongju Koh, assistant secretary of state for
democracy, human rights and labor.
</P>
<P>
   Though officially sanctioned segregation has been eliminated,
''de facto segregation and persistent racial discrimination
continue in parts of our society,'' Koh said.
</P>
<P>
   The study prepared by the Justice and State departments offered
several reminders of where America stands: the 1991 police beating
of black motorist Rodney King; the shooting death of African
immigrant Amadou Diallo by police in New York; the burning of
synagogues, mosques and black churches; the dragging death of James
Byrd Jr. in Texas; the shootings at a Jewish cultural center in Los
Angeles; and the discriminatory practices alleged in lawsuits
against Denny's restaurants and the Adam's Mark hotel chain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The true extent of contemporary racism remains clouded by
ignorance as well as differences of perception,'' the report said.
''While most whites do not believe there is much discrimination
today in American society, most minorities see the opposite in
their life experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Koh, who is of Korean descent, and another high-ranking
Asian-American in government said the United States has matured as
a multiracial, multiethnic society ahead of practically all other
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think we've learned some lessons of how to deal with the
realities of life in a multiracial, multiethnic setting,'' said
Bill Lann Lee, assistant attorney general for civil rights. ''Some
of these lessons are lessons that we've learned the hard way.''
However, ''In a sense, we're further ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee was twice nominated for the job he now holds, but a Senate
committee blocked his confirmation because opponents said he
advocated racial hiring quotas when he was an attorney for the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Clinton
appointed Lee in 1997 while Congress was in recess.
</P>
<P>
   The study was compiled by the State Department with assistance
from other federal agencies for a fall 2001 U.N. conference in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that while whites are a majority of Americans --
196.1 million -- they are a shrinking percentage of the population,
falling from 75.7 percent in 1991 to 71.9 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, the country's Asian population increased
by 46 percent to 10.9 million; the Hispanic population increased by
40 percent to 31.4 million; American Indians increased by 16
percent to 2.4 million; and the number of blacks rose by 14 percent
to 34.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The report indicated the growing diversity has led to inflamed
racial tension. But Koh said American race relations are nothing
like the ''virtually intractable'' ethnic rivalries in the Balkans,
Africa and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Sklar, the executive director of the World Organization
Against Torture USA, said the report minimized serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's fair to say we're far ahead of other
nations,'' said Sklar, who called the report ''disappointing.''
''It's totally unfair to downplay these problems by saying we're
doing better than other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sklar's organization released a separate report that said the
United States is out of compliance with the U.N. treaty in areas
such as affirmative action, racial profiling by police and
administration of the death penalty. The group urged the United
Nations to consider American-style racism a human rights problem.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department report stopped short of declaring racism in
America a human rights concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''No country or society is completely free of racism,
discrimination or ethnocentrism,'' the report said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Talks to Mich. Lawyers  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- President Clinton called on America's lawyers to
put pressure on the Republican-led Senate to confirm a long list of
judicial nominees who he said have been kept waiting for purely
partisan reasons. ''This is wrong. It is a denial of justice,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   In a trip Thursday to Michigan, a battleground state in the
presidential election, Clinton told a group of Michigan lawyers,
''I hope the bar will speak out against it strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate now has before it 42 nominations for federal
judgeships, including 34 who have never had a confirmation hearing.
He said 20 of those were nominated to fill seats where judges are
critically needed to address a logjam of legal business.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people are very highly qualified, which leads to only
one conclusion, that the appointments process has been politicized
in the hope of getting appointees ultimately to the bench who will
be more political,'' Clinton told the 65th annual meeting of
Michigan's state bar association.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the 42 unfilled seats are on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Michigan where Clinton said one-quarter of judgeships
are vacant. ''But you'd never know it from how the Senate has
acted, or refused to act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that his nominee, Helene White, has waited 3&AMP;frac12;
years for a hearing, ''longer than any nominee in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to White, who was in the audience, Clinton said, ''I
want to thank her for hanging in there through an ordeal that no
one should have to endure.''
</P>
<P>
   He said another nominee for the 6th Circuit, Kathleen
McCree-Lewis, has been waiting a hearing for a year, despite the
fact that she earned the highest ranking given by the American Bar
Association and would be the first black woman on the 6th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the situation was similar if not worse on the
4th Circuit in the Southeast where, he said, one-third of
judgeships were vacant. ''Although it has the largest percentage of
African-Americans of any circuit, it has never had a single
African-American, or, indeed, any person of color, as a judge,''
the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that in an election year there typically
was some slowdown in the Senate's consideration of judicial
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if you look at the statistics here, over the last five
years, this Senate has been far less forthcoming on these nominees
than the Democratic senators were with the Republican presidents
who were my predecessors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While in Michigan, the president also spoke to about 800 people
at a reception that raised an estimated $350,000 for the state
Democratic Party. Clinton was introduced by Rep. Debbie Stabenow,
D-Mich., who is challenging incumbent Republican Sen. Spence
Abraham in one of the hottest Senate races in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday in Flint, Mich., Clinton announced actions his
administration, private companies, universities and organizations
were taking to make sure more of the millions of Americans with
disabilities can join the digital economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this information age, when the pace of change increasingly
accelerates at a breathtaking rate, we cannot achieve that goal if
we leave any Americans stranded on the other side of the now-famous
digital divide,'' Clinton said at Mott Community College after
touring a center that trains people with disabilities to use new
tools to access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has directed the Cabinet to find ways to allow
Medicare and Medicaid pay for technology to enable people with
disabilities to live and work independently. Also, the AmeriCorps
community service program was awarding $9 million in grants to put
1,200 volunteers in schools and communities to teach computer
skills to students with disabilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the executive officers of more than 45 companies
pledged to train employees to develop products that give disabled
people better access to the digital world. And the presidents of 25
research universities said they would ensure that computer
scientists and engineers were trained on making computers that can
be more easily used by the disabled.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged in early trading Friday, as
investors fled the markets in the wake of additional profit
warnings by bellwether companies -- this time chipmaker Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 111.64 to 10,653.88.
</P>

<P>
   The world's largest chipmaker announced after the close of
Thursday's trading session that it expects third-quarter revenues

</P>
<P>
   The news prompted analysts at half a dozen investment banks to
lower their ratings on Intel's stock Friday, further fueling the
atmosphere of panic among one of Wall Street's most widely held
stocks. Shares of Intel were trading hands at breakneck speed on
the Nasdaq stock market, with volume of 34 million shares just in
the first hour -- just shy of its average daily volume of 38 million
shares.

   Shares were down $13.78, or 22 percent, to $47.70 in early

<HEADLINE> Exhibit Exploring Hip-Hop Opens  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- They seem unlikely items for a museum exhibit --
sneakers, handbills, a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   But viewed along with clothing, lyric sheets and album posters,
they document the rise of one of the biggest cultural phenomena of
the last 25 years: hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hip-Hop Nation: Roots, Rhymes, and Rage'' opened Friday at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, the first stop in a national tour. The
exhibit aims to examine the origins of an art form that started in
the Bronx and today spans the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world is embracing a new attitude, and that attitude is
influenced by hip-hop,'' said museum director Arnold Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hip-hop has empowered so many of us, it's unbelievable,'' said
guest curator Kevin Powell, who has been writing about the music
and culture of hip-hop for years.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit originated at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in
Cleveland, and was expanded for its New York debut.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of pieces to look at, from graffiti art to
Public Enemy's set list, to a document from the 1994 U.S. Senate
Judiciary Committee hearings on music and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion looms large, with clothing donated by names from every
era of hip-hop. There's a hat from Kool DJ Herc, tennis shoes from
Run D.M.C., a suit worn by the Notorious B.I.G. and a jersey worn
by DMX.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted this to be very visual,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Four elements of hip-hop culture are highlighted: DJing, MCing,
dance, and graffiti art.
</P>
<P>
   The first section, ''The Block Party,'' introduces viewers to
those four elements with demonstrations and interactive terminals
where they can try their hand at being DJs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Roots'' looks at hip-hop's origins, and showcases audio
equipment from the 1970s and early 1980s as well as items related
to pioneers like Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow.
</P>
<P>
   Section three deals with the mid-1980s to 1990, considered
hip-hop's creative ''Golden Era.'' It introduces acts like the
political Public Enemy, the feminist Queen Latifah and the gangsta
N.W.A.
</P>
<P>
   ''Controversy: Outrage and the Rise of Gangsta Rap'' focuses on
the 1990s, which were marked by events like the deaths of Tupac
Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G.
</P>
<P>
   The last section, ''Pop Goes the Culture,'' examines how hip-hop
has come to dominate American youth culture.
</P>
<P>
   While trying to be thorough, the exhibit does not try to be the
definitive retrospective, Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that people understand that this is an introduction to
the history of hip-hop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he wants it to inspire.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope people will want to learn more about this incredible
art form, this urban folk art,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit will be at the museum through the end of the year,
accompanied by workshops, films and performances.

<HEADLINE> White House To List Who Slept Over  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House said it would release a list
of overnight guests Friday in hopes of defusing political charges
that Hillary Rodham Clinton rewarded big campaign donors by letting
them stay in the executive mansion or at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has acknowledged that some contributors have been
invited to sleepovers, but denied that the invitations were made in
return for money.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have friends and supporters come and spend time with us and
spend the night with us that we are getting to know and who like
spending time with us,'' she said last week. ''I don't see what's
news about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is running against Republican Rick Lazio for the
Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y. Some of her largest contributors also have made donations to
other Clinton campaigns and causes, including the president's 1996
re-election campaign, his legal defense fund and his planned
post-presidential library.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign manager has accused the first lady of abusing
her power by having contributors stay overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''History is again repeating itself and has reached a new low,''
Bill Dal Col said last week, referring to criticism of the Clinton
administration after the 1996 re-election campaign for inviting big
donors to spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was criticized after the 1996
campaign for inviting big donors to spend the night. Republicans in
Congress, along with some less partisan critics, complained that
the practice dulled the majesty of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Lincoln Bedroom was never sold,'' Clinton said in 1997,
when the White House released a list of 938 guests who had spent
the night at the White House to that point in the Clinton
presidency. The list names did include political supporters, as
well as entertainment luminaries and old Clinton friends.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush came under fire
earlier this year after The Associated Press reported in March that
he had housed campaign supporters in the Texas governor's mansion.
Bush said they were all friends or relatives, but Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., compared the practice to Clinton's use of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill Clinton only charges $10,000 a night. He charges $100,000
a night,'' McCain said at the time. ''That's remarkable. This is
the sort of thing I've been railing about for two years.''

<HEADLINE> Iran Army Testing Skills Near Iraq  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A day after test-firing a new long-range
missile, Iran's regular army began its largest military exercises
of the year Friday in mountainous terrain near the Iraqi border,
state-run television reported.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day maneuvers in the western Kurdistan province were
being supervised by top Iranian military commanders and involved
airborne units and ground troops using radar interception systems,
the broadcast said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of troops participating was not known.
</P>
<P>
   ''The maneuvers are aimed at testing the army's defense
capability and its military might,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The war games, code-named Zolfaqar-3, began a day after Iran
test-fired its first solid-liquid fuel missile, raising concerns in
Israel and in Washington that Iran is developing its long-range
offensive missile capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's Defense Minister Vice Adm. Ali Shamkhani said the
Shahab-3D missile would be used for nonmilitary purposes, such as
launching satellites, the Islamic Republic News Agency said.
Shamkhani insisted Iran did not produce offensive weapons, the
agency added.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington and Israel, the test caused serious concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regard their aggressive efforts to develop missile
capability as a serious threat,'' a State Department deputy
spokesman, Philip Reeker, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's deputy defense minister Ephraim Sneh said that the
missile development program, coupled with a parallel effort to
build a nuclear warhead, spelled danger not only for Israel but for
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''This the second test in a short time. It's now obvious that
Iran embarking on a colossal effort to build a long-range missile
capability,'' he said. ''It means that in a few years time, Iran
will be able to threaten with a nuclear weapon, a very broad part
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran has built and tested a number of missiles, including the
Shahab-3 which has a range of 810 miles. Washington denounced a
July test of the Shahab-3, which it said could reach Israel or U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were down across the board Friday, as
profit warnings by bellwether companies -- this time chipmaker Intel
Corp. -- prompted investors to flee the markets.
</P>
<P>
   In midmorning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 101.28 to 10,664.24.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The technology focused
Nasdaq composite index was down 105.97 at 3,722.90, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 16.21 at 1,432.84.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Gallagher, head of U.S. equity trading at CIBC World
Markets, said investors have been concerned primarily with three
issues in recent weeks -- earnings, the decline in value of the
euro, and rising energy prices. The ''Big Three,'' he called them.
</P>
<P>
   All three are intertwined in the global marketplace, Gallagher
noted, citing the Intel warning as a textbook example.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, with Europe's single currency hovering around
all-time lows, large, multinational corporations are feeling the
pinch in their European operations.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the world's largest chipmaker announced after the close
of Thursday's trading session that it expects third-quarter
revenues to fall below earlier expectations. The company
specifically blamed a falloff in demand in Europe for the weaker
results.
</P>
<P>
   The news prompted analysts at half a dozen investment banks to
lower their ratings on Intel's stock Friday, further fueling the
atmosphere of panic among one of Wall Street's most widely held
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Intel were trading hands at breakneck speed on the
Nasdaq stock market, with volume of 156 million shares just in the
first two hours. Intel's average daily volume is 38 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got this shocker from Intel, which is probably the leading
tech game in town, and that really frightened people into thinking
that perhaps some of the valuations in the tech area might be too
high,'' said Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's shares were down $13.05, or 21 percent, to $48.44.
</P>
<P>
   Investors began fleeing the market in after-hours trading
Thursday evening, and that exodus expanded in scope at Friday's
opening.
</P>
<P>
   Intel led the way, but other widely held technology stocks also
felt investors' wrath. Microsoft was down $2.06 at $62.13, Cisco
Systems fell $1.38 to $59.75, and Dell Computers dropped $3.63 to
$34.31.
</P>
<P>
   With third-quarter earnings season just a few weeks away and
increasing signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, investors have
been punishing stocks whose companies fail to meet their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 414.72 million
shares, well ahead of Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 4.74 to 509.61.

<HEADLINE> Norway Hotel Guests' Suite Payback  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- When two pranksters returned to the northern
town of Bodoe, a local hotel got what might be called suite
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Espen Thoresen and Kristoffer Schau disassembled
everything in their room at the Central Hotel, down to the last
screw, as a stunt for their television program. Then they broadcast
the whole process, which left the room littered with pieces of
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   So when the duo returned to Bodoe, 60 miles north of the Arctic
Circle, on Sept. 14, the Grand Hotel knew exactly how they liked
their rooms, and obliged, Norwegian newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel staff took apart every piece of furniture, and took
down every lamp and picture in their room before the two checked
in.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't mess with the hotel business in Bodoe,'' hotel
manager Unni Olsen said. ''They took it pretty well. In fact, they
thought it was very funny.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Discussed Lee With Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno said President
Clinton, who had earlier criticized her department's handling of
the Wen Ho Lee case, was ''thoughtful and supportive'' in a brief
telephone discussion of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't go into detail, but we had a good conversation,''
Reno told her weekly news conference Friday. She said she looked
forward to a more detailed discussion face-to-face later in the day
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Reno said the telephone conversation occurred Wednesday
and lasted five to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a chance to discuss it, and he was thoughtful and
supportive,'' Reno said of the call. ''I think anybody who looks at
this case and doesn't know the circumstances of it is going to say,
'Why?' And I think that's what the president kind of naturally
asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton said the nine months that former Los Alamos
nuclear scientist Lee spent in detention ''just can't be
justified,'' but Reno refused to apologize and said the confinement
was the nuclear scientist's own fault.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Lee, a former Los Alamos laboratory scientist,
went free last week after pleading guilty to one felony of
mishandling weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Lee could have ended his detention earlier by agreeing
earlier to plead guilty and tell the government what he did with
the secrets.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis J. Freeh said ''the safety of the nation
demands that we take this important step'' under which Lee was
sentenced to the 278 days he had served. The government dropped 58
other counts, which could have carried a term of up to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Reno spoke, Clinton expressed an opinion far closer
to that of U.S. District Judge James Parker, who said Lee's
detention ''embarrassed our entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he found it difficult in retrospect to reconcile
how the government could ''keep someone in jail without bail, argue
right up to the 11th hour that they're a terrible risk, and then
turn around and make that sort of plea agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It just can't be justified. ... I too am quite troubled by
it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday why Clinton wasn't aware of the details earlier,
Reno replied, ''The president of the United States has taken great
care not to infringe in law enforcement decisions so as to avoid a
political charge that it's politically influenced. He has been very
good about that. ... I can't think of any case in which he has
interfered in any way that I consider inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Like everybody else, he said, 'How do you go from here to
here, and why did it happen?','' Reno added. Based on the telephone
conversation and the scheduled face-to-face session, she said, ''I
think he'll understand.''

<HEADLINE> Outspoken Taiwan VP To Visit U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By ANNIE HUANG
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's new vice president often says
things that rile rival China, and that's what worries many
Taiwanese about her first trip abroad as the island's No. 2 leader.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Lu departed for Central America on Friday with an
entourage that included six female lawmakers and senior officials.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, she said she was leaving with an ''empty
pocket'' and would not offer financial aid during her tour. Rather,
she said, she will share Taiwan's democratic experience with El
Salvador, Honduras, Belize and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   She also will make stops in Los Angeles, Miami and San
Francisco. The Harvard-educated Lu had wanted to visit New York,
but U.S. officials rejected that request.
</P>
<P>
   Yen Chen-sheng, a researcher with the Institute of International
Relations in Taipei, said Washington likely feared that the vice
president might not honor promises to keep her U.S. transit visits
low key.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lu has a strong interest in foreign relations, and you can't
expect her to keep quiet when she gets a chance,'' Yen said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most nations, the United States has diplomatic relations
with China and has promised Beijing that it will not have formal
ties with Taiwan, which split with the mainland amid a civil war in
1949. China insists Taiwan is a breakaway province and pressures
the United States not to allow Taiwanese leaders to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Washington traditionally allows Taiwan's leaders to make brief
stopovers, and the Taiwanese usually avoid the media and make few
public appearances. During a stopover in July, President Chen
Shui-bian declined to meet with members of Congress and stayed in
his hotel when he stopped in Los Angeles for about a day.
</P>
<P>
   Until she was elected with Chen in March, Lu had led frequent
demonstrations outside the U.N. headquarters to campaign for
Taiwan's bid to rejoin the world body. Taiwan gave up its U.N. seat
in 1971 when the United Nations admitted Beijing as the sole
legitimate ruler of China.
</P>
<P>
   A pioneering Taiwanese feminist and rights activist who had
served six years in jail for voicing political dissent during
Taiwan's martial law era, Lu has been an outspoken critic of
China's repressive rule and suppression of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was also a former vocal supporter of Taiwan's
formal independence from China, a move Beijing has threatened to
use force to stop. Although she has toned down her comments since
the election, China's state-run media have called her a ''traitor''
and ''scum of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lu has shown unusual restraint after the Taiwanese gave her a
poor rating -- lowest among all Cabinet ministers -- for complaining
in public that she has no influence in foreign relations and other
important matters and was being treated like a ''flower vase.'' She
has diverted her attention to human rights and high-tech
development.
</P>
<P>
   But she has not relaxed her anti-China rhetoric. She has called
Beijing's tirade against her a tactic to divide up Taiwan's
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must not dance to their tune,'' Lu recently told reporters.

<HEADLINE> White S. African Farmers Can Stay  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- White farmers facing eviction from their
land won a temporary reprieve Friday when Zimbabwe's highest court
ruled the eviction notices illegal and said farmers shouldn't be
forced to leave before the year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court said the Agriculture Ministry did not meet
conditions of the land acquisition laws when it served about 100
farmers with 30-day eviction notices last month. Some notices
ordered farmers to be out by Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires that eviction notices be issued by a court, not
the Agriculture Ministry, said Alex Masterson, an attorney for the
Commercial Farmers Union. The law also says there should be at
least 90 days between the serving of a court notice and departure
from a seized property.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys consented to the ruling and did not oppose to a
motion for the eviction orders to be canceled, Masterson said.
</P>
<P>
   The government has said it will not relent on its plans to
nationalize about 3,000 white farms totaling about 12 million acres
for resettlement by impoverished blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Many properties were intended for resettlement before the start
of seasonal rains around November. But the Supreme Court ruling
means none of the owners of 2,040 farms listed for confiscation so
far could be forcibly evicted before next year.
</P>
<P>
   The government on Friday listed 29 more properties it intends to
confiscate.
</P>
<P>
   The law gives those owners 30 days to file objections to
confiscation and then submit claims for payment for buildings and
improvements if objections are overruled.
</P>
<P>
   The land seizure program has been plagued by administrative and
legal errors.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers union says no properties listed as early as June
have been visited by state evaluators to assess the value of
irrigation and other improvements, a process required by the law
before formal eviction notices can be considered by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers union has argued that legal procedures were not
being followed and constitutional rights were being violated.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also demands that the government restore law and
order in farming districts across the country following the illegal
occupation since February of more than 1,700 white-owned farms by
ruling party militants and mobs of violent squatters.
</P>
<P>
   The government has defied two court orders to clear illegal
squatters off private land. President Robert Mugabe has described
the occupations as a justified protest against unfair land
ownership by whites.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 farmers union members -- mostly the descendants of
British and South African colonial era settlers -- own a third of
the nation's productive land, where 2 million farm workers and
their families live. About 7.5 million blacks live on the rest.

<HEADLINE> Guard: Duties Abroad Strain Lives  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID FOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Colleen Roberts, a captain in the Washington state Army National
Guard, put her life on hold last winter for a seven-month mission
with U.S. peacekeeping forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   She left her 9-year-old son in her mother's care. She figured
her husband, an Army captain, could fend for himself. As for her
master's degree in public administration, she decided it would have
to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, an active-duty or reserve soldier for 19 of her 37
years, is no stranger to the military's transient lifestyle. But
this mission, featuring a bitter Kosovo winter and cramped quarters
in a wheatfield encampment, seemed over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ''That much time away from your family is a very long time,''
she said. ''A VERY long time. Let's just say it's difficult on a
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   As Roberts can attest, the National Guard is no longer just a
force of ''weekend warriors'' who train once a month at the local
armory and respond occasionally to local floods, fires or
hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   An Army policy announced last week, aligning Guard divisions
with specific active-duty forces for training purposes, makes it
even more likely that Guard members will be sent overseas for
combat duty.
</P>
<P>
   It's one more sign of the Pentagon's growing reliance on the
Guard's part-time citizen soldiers -- a change not all those
soldiers like.
</P>
<P>
   More duties abroad have strained lives at home, as National
Guard members try to balance family and careers with military
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Every state has its own National Guard, under control of the
governor unless mobilized for federal duty. Fifteen years ago,
mobilizations were rare. But not today, as a downsized, post-Cold
War military struggles to meet growing peacekeeping duties around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the Guard's 360,000 soldiers have put in just
over 1 million soldier-days in overseas training or real missions,
or about 13 times more than during the early 1980s, said Dan
Donohue, a National Guard spokesman in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   All the activity is too much for some.
</P>
<P>
   2nd Lt. Rochelle Touchard, 28, of St. Charles Parish in
Louisiana, dropped out last November from her Guard unit, which now
is serving in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The weekend warrior image doesn't apply anymore,'' Touchard
said. ''The stress on our family was a little too great.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is also in the Guard, and they felt that someone
needed to stay home with their 5-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas Army National Guard's 3rd Battalion, which is
gearing up for deployment next summer to Bosnia, Lt. Luke Cogburn
said a few soldiers have decided not to sign up again because of
the increased commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ''With our training schedule, we're going to take them away from
their jobs for two months this year, and we're not even
deploying,'' Cogburn said.
</P>
<P>
   By law, employers must hold Guard members' jobs until their
return from active duty. Such duty pays normal Army salaries, which
can be up to 65 percent less than civilian earnings, according to a
study by the California National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're a junior executive making $60,000 and come into
active duty as a specialist making $20,000 a year, that's a big
drop in income,'' said Maj. Stan Zezotarski of the California
Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Patriotism and camaraderie help compensate, at least for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   ''One deployment is hoo-ah, that's really good, morale is up,''
Zezotarsksi said. ''Two deployments, you start having a retention
problem. It takes a toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Forde, a construction worker in civilian life and an
assistant division engineer for the 34th Division of the Minnesota
National Guard, said he thinks the Army is right to lean more
heavily on the Guard. But he knows some colleagues don't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many soldiers think that pulling them out of the civilian work
force is an inconvenience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Guard is meeting its recruitment and retention
goals, Donohue said, and Guard leaders are seeking ways to minimize
disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Army last March set a six-month limit for overseas
deployments of Guard and reserve units, and Guard officials are
negotiating with the Pentagon for the flexibility to allow even
shorter rotations.
</P>
<P>
   They also intend to fill missions as much as possible with
volunteers. In fact, many Guard members jump at the chance to head
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Enyeart, 26, joined the Maryland National Guard out of
high school on the heels of the Gulf War. He liked the idea of Army
discipline paired with weekend romps in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   He is still a weekend Guardsman, but now Enyeart spends his
weekdays in uniform as well, repairing his unit's Humvees as a
civilian employee. He is eager to go on active duty.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I'm concerned, the Maryland National Guard is just
about first priority,'' Enyeart said.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Urges North Korea on Peace  </HEADLINE>
By GINNY PARKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Warning that peace could not mean a ''one-way
street'' of Western aid for North Korea, U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen on Friday urged the communist regime to build trust
by reducing military tensions, pulling back troops and eliminating
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen discussed the Korean peace process in meetings with
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori and Foreign Minister Yohei
Kono, reiterating that North Korea remains a military threat and
that a continued U.S. military presence in South Korea is
important.
</P>
<P>
   ''It cannot be a one-way street,'' Cohen said in Tokyo on the
last leg of an Asian tour that included a stop in South Korea.
''The North cannot take the position that the only basis for
discussion will be ... economic aid.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung arrived in Tokyo on Friday
for talks with Japanese leaders. North Korea is expected to top the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals North and South Korea have taken notable steps toward
reconciliation since leaders of the two countries held a historic
summit in June, agreeing to work toward peace and eventual
unification.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen stressed that, despite the recent thaw, North Korea's
military is better prepared for combat now than it was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though there are possible signs of peace and intentions,
there are still many dangers,'' including its arsenals of
biological, chemical and possibly nuclear weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a Pentagon report released Thursday, Cohen said the
North Korean military had made major improvements, including moving
large pieces of artillery near the Demilitarized Zone that
separates the North from the South.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean Peninsula was partitioned at the end of World War II.
The two fought a 1950-53 war and the border between them remains
the world's most heavily armed. Some 37,000 U.S. troops are based
in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross negotiators from South and North Korea agreed Friday
to extend meetings on reuniting more families separated for half a
century, after failing to make progress on a number of issues,
media pool reports said.
</P>
<P>
   The first such reunions happened in August, when 100 people from
each side crossed the border for four days of temporary reunions
with family members they had not seen since the war.
</P>
<P>
   In talks with Mori, Cohen also asked Japan to address the issue
of toxin-laden smoke pouring from a private garbage incinerator
near a U.S. Navy base.
</P>
<P>
   Pollutants from the plant have rolled into housing complexes at
the Atsugi Naval Air Facility for years. Mori told Cohen he was
aware of it and would do his best to improve the situation.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Continues Sanctions Threats  </HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Saddam Hussein has few weapons left, but his
vast oil wealth and knack for brinksmanship have kept the Iraqi
president a continuous irritant to his neighbors and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has neither the conventional military muscle nor the
political stomach for renewed conflict against the United States
and its allies. And while strong suspicions persist that he has
resumed his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, Iraqi
opposition leaders and Western experts believe their use is highly
unlikely given the near certainty of decisive retaliation from the
West.
</P>
<P>
   So why does Saddam sound like he's spoiling for a fight these
days?
</P>
<P>
   Some experts and opposition leaders suspect his saber-rattling
may be designed to press what Saddam sees as an advantage, with
several countries questioning whether to continue the crippling
trade sanctions imposed in 1990 to punish Iraq for invading Kuwait.
He also may see a chance to use his ability to influence oil
markets to hurt his arch enemy, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few days, Saddam has promised to take ''proper
action'' against Kuwait, alleging Kuwait was stealing Iraqi oil -- a
similar accusation was made in the days preceding Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait. He also made thinly veiled threats to cut Iraq's oil
output to push higher already soaring prices.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, in a possible show of force, Iraq flew a jet
fighter over Saudi airspace for the first time in more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations against Kuwait -- vehemently denied by Kuwait --
sent prices even higher as major consumers like the United States
begged oil producers to increase output to bring prices down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saddam is looking at a golden opportunity to hurt the
economies of the United States and its Western allies at a time
when most producers are pumping at or near maximum capacity,'' said
Jean Pascal Zanders of the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Zanders, like other experts, believes that Saddam's latest show
of bravado may have been encouraged by his conviction that the
United States was too preoccupied with its November presidential
election to deal with him and by a growing resentment in the Arab
world of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has in the past engineered crises to draw attention to what
it sees as the injustice of the sanctions and a U.N.-supervised
program under which it can sell as much oil as it wants provided it
only uses the returns to buy humanitarian goods and compensate
victims of its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ''The regime needs crises constantly, and if there isn't one it
creates a crisis,'' said Sobhi al-Joumaili of the opposition Iraqi
Communist Party. ''Saddam wants things to escalate so the sanctions
are lifted the way he wants them to be lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has friends who oppose the sanctions. President Hugo Chavez
of Venezuela visited Baghdad last month, the first head of state to
do so since the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a French passenger aircraft with doctors, sportsmen
and writers aboard flew to Baghdad from Paris after France refused
a delay requested by the U.N. Sanctions Committee, which says the
United Nations bans flights to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sent a similar flight to Baghdad last Sunday, while
Jordan, Iraq's neighbor and its main gate to the outside world
since the sanctions began, says it wants to resume flights to
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent U.N. Security Council members France, Russia and China
this week expressed their opposition to a $16 billion compensation
pay-out by Iraq to Kuwait Petroleum Corp. Iraq, which faces 2.6
million such claims for a total of $320 billion, questions the
legal grounds of most of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a farce that should have been stopped a long time ago,''
was how Arab affairs expert Patrick Seale described the
compensation burden on Iraq in Thursday's edition of the
London-based Arabic daily al-Hayat.
</P>
<P>
   Seale said the sanctions must be lifted in return for a pledge
of good behavior from Saddam. ''Saddam Hussein is a brutal ruler
whose human rights record is horrific but he will certainly not be
the first or the worst dictator that Western or Middle Eastern
nations deal with,'' Seale said.
</P>
<P>
   There's no guarantee Saddam would keep a promise of good
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have iron-cast proof, but everything suggests that
Iraq has resumed its mass destruction weapons program,'' said
Duncan Lennox, editor of Jane's Strategic Weapon Systems.

<HEADLINE> Term Limits for Director Proposed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation introduced by a House Republican
would establish a 10-year term for the director of the Census
Bureau, which supporters say would help insulate the statistical
agency from political influences.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsor, Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the
House Government Reform census subcommittee, said Thursday the
proposal ''would also allow one director to supervise an entire
census from planning to implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, the federal government is required to
take a national census every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, the subcommittee's ranking
Democrat, is proposing a five-year term. Aides said her proposal,
to be presented in a separate bill, would allow for a director to
supervise the exercise's crucial planning and operations stages
leading to and including the count.
</P>
<P>
   The census director's position is a political appointment but
currently has no term limit, although the president can remove the
director at any time. The proposals would fix terms across
presidential elections, which both representatives say is important
to keep political infighting out of the process.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the parties have been arguing over the Census
Bureau's plan to release a second population count based on
statistical sampling. Sampling supporters say it would help account
for people missed in the actual ''head count'' -- including
minorities, the poor, and inner-city residents, who tend to vote
Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything that ensures the public that the Census Bureau is
nothing but a nonpartisan statistical agency is good for the
country,'' Census spokesman Steve Jost said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Congressional Research Service, more than 300
federal appointees have fixed terms, ranging from two to 14 years.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Leader Suu Kyi Detained  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Striking a fresh blow against
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the military government on
Friday detained her deputy and eight other followers after
thwarting their latest attempt to travel outside the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, the deputy leader of her National League for
Democracy, were evicted from Yangon's railway station early Friday
when they became ''abusive,'' a government statement said. Suu Kyi
was escorted home, it added.
</P>
<P>
   But Tin Oo, 77, and eight other party workers who were planning
to accompany Suu Kyi to the north for party work were taken to a
''government guest house as a temporary measure to prevent similar
incidents,'' the military said.
</P>
<P>
   The group wanted to take the train to Mandalay, Myanmar's
second-largest city, 350 miles north of Yangon, but the government
claimed tickets were sold out. Suu Kyi's sympathizers believe that
was a pretext to prevent her from traveling.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's last confrontation with the government was Aug. 24,
when she was barred from driving to a southern town. She was put
under virtual house arrest along with Tin Oo and other party
members from Sept. 1 to Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   On her release, she immediately vowed to challenge the
unofficial travel ban again.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Suu Kyi tried to travel by train, also to
Mandalay, in 1996, authorities disconnected her carriage, claiming
mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's party won a 1990 general election but the military
refused to hand over power.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, several opposition leaders have been detained in
government guest houses, off limits to reporters and other
observers, for as long as two years. The government denies such
detention constitutes arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been under military rule since
1962. The current junta took power in 1988 after crushing a
nationwide uprising for democracy and killing thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi was kept under house arrest from 1989 to 1995, and her
movements have remained heavily restricted. She won the 1991 Nobel
Peace Prize for her nonviolent efforts to promote democracy.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Myanmar's Foreign Minister Win Aung told the
United Nations that his government has been under ''unfair
scrutiny'' and political pressure from other nations while it is
establishing its own kind of democracy.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 92; Dow Drops 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower Friday, as another
profit warning by a bellwether company -- this time chipmaker Intel
Corp. -- prompted investors to flee the markets.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 7.03 to 10,758.49. Bargain hunters helped
blue-chip stocks recover from losses that dropped the Dow more than
130 points earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The technology focused
Nasdaq composite index was down 92.01 at 3,736.86, and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 15.07 at 1,433.98.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Gallagher, head of U.S. equity trading at CIBC World
Markets, said investors have been concerned primarily with three
issues in recent weeks -- earnings, the decline in value of the
euro, and rising energy prices. The ''Big Three,'' he called them.
</P>
<P>
   All three are intertwined in the global marketplace, Gallagher
noted, citing the Intel warning as a textbook example of how each
condition affects the other.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, with Europe's single currency hovering around
all-time lows, large, multinational corporations are feeling the
pinch in their European operations.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the world's largest chipmaker announced after the close
of Thursday's trading session that it expects third-quarter
revenues to fall below earlier expectations. The company
specifically blamed a falloff in demand in Europe for the weaker
results.
</P>
<P>
   The news prompted analysts at half a dozen investment banks to
lower their ratings on Intel's stock Friday, further fueling the
atmosphere of panic among investors in one of Wall Street's most
widely held stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Intel were trading hands at a breakneck speed on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. Volume reached 244 million, easily breaking
the all-time daily Nasdaq volume record of 172 million shares set
by Oracle Corp. in December 1997. Intel's average daily volume is
38 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got this shocker from Intel, which is probably the leading
tech game in town, and that really frightened people into thinking
that perhaps some of the valuations in the tech area might be too
high,'' said Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's shares were down $12.73, or 21 percent, to $48.75.
</P>
<P>
   Investors began fleeing the market in after-hours trading
Thursday evening, and that exodus expanded in scope at Friday's
opening.
</P>
<P>
   Intel led the way, but other widely held technology stocks also
felt investors' wrath. Microsoft was down $1.69 at $62.50, Cisco
Systems fell $1.44 to $59.69, and Dell Computer dropped $3 to
$34.94.
</P>
<P>
   With third-quarter earnings season just a few weeks away and
increasing signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, investors have
been punishing stocks whose companies fail to meet their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 792 million shares,
well ahead of Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 3.94 to 510.41.

<HEADLINE> Former 'Airwolf' Start Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGUNA NIGUEL, Calif. (AP) -- Jan-Michael Vincent has been
sentenced to 60 days in jail for violating probation stemming from
a 1996 drunken driving crash that left him with a broken neck.
</P>
<P>
   The former ''Airwolf'' star, who was sentenced Thursday, was
also on probation for public drunkenness last year in Orange
County.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent, 56, admitted violating his probation four times,
including a July arrest on a domestic violence charge. He was also
arrested in January in Santa Monica when someone called police
about a man rolling around on the grass in a park.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to begin serving his jail term next Friday.

<HEADLINE> Puffy, Publisher Settle Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Cross the gospel classic ''I'll Fly
Away'' with the rap hit ''I'll Be Missing You'' and here's what you
get: ''I'll See You in Court.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a happy ending: Music publisher Albert E. Brumley &AMP;
Sons this week settled its federal lawsuit against rapper Sean
''Puffy'' Combs over his use of part of the gospel song. Terms were
not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The Grammy-winning 1997 song, Combs' tribute to rapper Notorious
B.I.G., blends in eight words from ''I'll Fly Away,'' which Albert
Brumley composed in 1929 while picking cotton. It became one of the
most-recorded gospel songs.
</P>
<P>
   Combs' song also includes words and music from ''Every Breath
You Take,'' a hit from Sting and his former band, The Police. The
pop star, who was also named in the suit, helped get the two sides
into mediation.

<HEADLINE> 'Dr. Laura' Show Halts Production  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Dr. Laura Schlessinger's new television show
made it on the air despite advertiser boycotts and protests by gay
rights groups. Now, viewer apathy may knock it off.
</P>
<P>
   With the ''Dr. Laura'' syndicated talk show struggling in the
ratings, production has been briefly stopped for some retooling, a
show spokeswoman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount Television, which makes the show, is adding a new
producer. A planned four-day break in the production schedule was
moved up to this week, said Daniella Cracknell, a show spokeswoman.
New shows will continue airing every weekday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The show is not going off,'' Cracknell said. ''We're just
preparing for (ratings) sweeps.''
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old Schlessinger, who first gained a wide following
with her radio call-in advice show, has been roundly criticized by
gay activists for her comments on homosexuality, which she has
termed ''deviant'' and ''a biological error.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates have pressured several sponsors from advertising on
the show. Procter &AMP; Gamble, one of the nation's largest
advertisers, pulled ads from Schlessinger's radio program in May
and dropped plans to advertise on the television show.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount and its stations have been forced to sell advertising
time at discounted rates.
</P>
<P>
   The show debuted on Sept. 11. Critics pronounced it dull,
perhaps because of an effort to avoid controversy. During its first
week, it averaged roughly three million viewers, and ratings have
dropped 11 percent in the second week, said Marc Berman, an analyst
for Mediaweek.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a major disappointment,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ''Oprah'' regularly draws about 11 million viewers
and ''The Sally Jesse Raphael Show'' gets about 6 million people,
he said. Schlessinger's ratings are only slightly better than
Martin Short's show last year, which was canceled at the end of its
first season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's obvious to me that Paramount is coaching her and toning
her down,'' Berman said. ''That's not what she should be doing. She
should be confrontational, like she's been on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation claimed credit for the show's slow start.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, Paramount will realize the show was in trouble the
second it started airing,'' said Cathy Renna of GLAAD. ''There's
nothing here to retool. It's a program they need to drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Renna said Schlessinger ''has not uttered the word gay'' in two
weeks on the air. But she said GLAAD feared Schlessinger might
begin using more extreme tactics in order to attract viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Berman said the show, which attracted good time slots in
stations around the country, could be in trouble if history is any
guide. He compared ''Dr. Laura'' to the initial poor reaction to
Roseanne's talk show in 1998. That show limped to a conclusion
after two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you launch a show, you have to get it right from the
beginning,'' he said. ''Whoever saw the show isn't going to come
back if they didn't like it from the beginning.''

<HEADLINE> Former 'Airwolf' Star Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGUNA NIGUEL, Calif. (AP) -- Jan-Michael Vincent has been
sentenced to 60 days in jail for violating probation stemming from
a 1996 drunken driving crash that left him with a broken neck.
</P>
<P>
   The former ''Airwolf'' star, who was sentenced Thursday, was
also on probation for public drunkenness last year in Orange
County.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent, 56, admitted violating his probation four times,
including a July arrest on a domestic violence charge. He was also
arrested in January in Santa Monica when someone called police
about a man rolling around on the grass in a park.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to begin serving his jail term next Friday.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Asylum for Iraqi Christians  </HEADLINE>
By DARA AKIKO WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- U.N. officials urged about 150 Iraqi men,
women and children to seek asylum in Mexico in order to expedite
their release from a shabby Tijuana hotel where they've been held
for two days.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi Chaldeans, who are Christian, have been gathering the
past few months in Tijuana and had planned to seek asylum in the
United States, fearing religious persecution if they returned to
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   They were being detained as part of what Mexican authorities
called an investigation into immigration violations. It wasn't
immediately known what prompted Wednesday's crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''The position of the U.N. actually is if they don't ask for
political asylum in Mexico, the representative of the U.N. (in Baja
California) can't do anything for them,'' Eduardo de la Pena, a
spokesman for the local U.N. office, said Thursday. ''It is
quickest if they ask for asylum first in Mexico and then try to get
to the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis prefer to request asylum in the United States and, if
rejected, would turn to Mexico, said Romil Gewarges, who came to
help his sister-in-law and her family.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're waiting for the last minute to see what happens,''
Gewarges said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican federal authorities were still trying to determine
whether the Iraqis broke any laws when they entered Mexico. The
process has been slow and could take until Saturday to complete
because documents must be translated from Arabic to Spanish, said
Tijuana City Councilman Carlos Mora.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Mexican officials could allow the immigrants
to pass into the United States, Mora said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are very specific cases in which the law allows someone
seeking political asylum as a refugee to use Mexico as a bridge
between two nations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Suites hotel has become an internationally known way
station for Chaldeans seeking political asylum in the United
States. In nearby San Diego, across the world's busiest port of
entry, at least 77 Iraqis were detained by U.S. authorities this
week after they tried to enter the United States without visas
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Mexican officials allowed friends and relatives to
meet briefly with the immigrants in a small room inside the hotel.
Some visitors brought in snacks and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just broke my heart,'' said Hadeer Hanna Hurmez, who spoke
with his parents for about 30 minutes. ''They're scared. They were
crying all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the immigrants is an Iraqi soldier who fled the military
but was caught and sent to prison, de la Pena said. He escaped
prison and made it to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's afraid because he's sure he's going to be hanged'' if he
returns to Iraq, de la Pena said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Chaldean presented U.S. documents granting him asylum
but Mexican authorities would not immediately release him, de la
Pena said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi refugees had been staying at the hotel while waiting for
American authorities to process asylum applications, according to
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say to you death or asylum, nothing else!'' shouted one of
the Iraqis, Talale Hanna, as he leaned out a window of the
four-story hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The number of applications from Iraqi Christians seeking asylum
at the San Ysidro, Calif., border crossing has increased from
virtually none last year to 172 in the past two months, said Robert
Looney, the Immigration and Naturalization Service's director of
regional asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego area, just a half-hour away, has the
second-largest community of Chaldeans in the United States. The
Detroit area has the largest.
</P>
<P>
   Chaldeans number about 800,000 worldwide, about half of whom are
in Iraq. Some 120,000 live in the United States, including an
estimated 15,000 in San Diego County.

<HEADLINE> Group: Labor Official Made Threat  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The director of a homeless veterans coalition
has alleged to Labor Department investigators that a top agency
official threatened to withhold grant money because of differences
over veterans legislation, people familiar with the allegations
say.
</P>
<P>
   The grant was recently rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations by Linda Boone, executive director of the
National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, were investigated by
department lawyers and Secretary Alexis Herman has concluded no
laws were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The official in question, Assistant Secretary Espiridion
Borrego, denies making the comment to Boone, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But a member of Congress wants the allegations to be reviewed by
the department's independent watchdog, the inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very concerned about these allegations of intimidation
and coercion by an administration official which appear aimed at
influencing the outcome of VA committee legislation,'' said Rep.
Terry Everett, R-Ala., chairman of the House Veterans Affairs
investigations subcommittee
</P>
<P>
   Boone's allegations mark the second time in recent months an
advocate for homeless veterans has accused Borrego of exerting
pressure concerning a bill to provide job counseling, education and
training to veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Heather French, the reigning Miss America, and two House members
complained in July that Borrego improperly tried to persuade French
to change her congressional testimony supporting the same bill.
</P>
<P>
   French, the daughter of a Marine veteran who was wounded in
Vietnam, has made homeless veterans her cause and testified several
times before Congress about their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Boone alleged to Labor investigators that in a meeting last
March, Borrego told her he would find it very difficult to provide
grant money to her coalition if it continued to support job
counseling provisions in the legislation that he opposed, according
to government and nongovernment sources familiar with the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The sources spoke only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego, who oversees veterans employment and training, ''flatly
denies'' making the comment, Labor Department spokesman Carl
Fillichio said.
</P>
<P>
   Fillichio declined, however, to provide interview notes from the
investigation. ''We feel it is inappropriate to discuss specific
details of the interviews,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, the department rejected a request from Boone's
coalition for a $121,277 grant to assist community groups serving
homeless veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The department's letter said ''funds available through the
Homeless Veterans Reintegration Projects (HVRP) for special
emphasis programs, such as the one you propose, are extremely
limited.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency also said it would ''explore the possibilities'' and
might reconsider Boone's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the earlier allegations by French, Herman has said she
is confident after an internal inquiry that ''no laws or
regulations were violated by Mr. Borrego'' in his comments.
</P>
<P>
   Herman's letter did not address Borrego's conversation with
Boone, who was interviewed as part of the French inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Boone and Borrego had sharp differences over language that could
have cost 2,700 employment counselors their jobs if they performed
poorly in finding positions for veterans. Borrego, whose office
controls the funding for these positions, sought to preserve the
jobs while Boone argued that local community groups could serve
veterans better.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego eventually was successful in having the language removed
by a House committee.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 47; Nasdaq Falls 82  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks staged a healthy recovery
Friday, but technology shares were whipped after another profit
warning by a bellwether company -- this time chipmaker Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 46.70 to 10,812.22. Bargain hunters moved
into the markets around midday, helping blue-chip stocks recover
from losses that dropped the Dow more than 140 points earlier in
the session.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower. The technology focused
Nasdaq composite index was down 81.50 at 3,747.37, and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 12.05 at 1,437.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Gallagher, head of U.S. equity trading at CIBC World
Markets, said investors have been concerned primarily with three
issues in recent weeks -- earnings, the decline in value of the
euro, and rising energy prices. The ''Big Three,'' he called them.
</P>
<P>
   All three are intertwined in the global marketplace, Gallagher
noted, citing the Intel warning as a textbook example of how each
condition affects the other.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, with Europe's single currency hovering around
all-time lows, large, multinational corporations are feeling the
pinch in their European operations.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the world's largest chipmaker announced after the close
of Thursday's trading session that it expects third-quarter
revenues to fall below earlier expectations. The company
specifically blamed a falloff in demand in Europe for the weaker
results.
</P>
<P>
   The news prompted analysts at half a dozen investment banks to
lower their ratings on Intel's stock Friday, further fueling the
atmosphere of panic among investors in one of Wall Street's most
widely held stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Intel were trading hands at a breakneck speed on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. Volume reached 266 million, easily breaking
the all-time daily Nasdaq volume record of 172 million shares set
by Oracle Corp. in December 1997. Intel's average daily volume is
38 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got this shocker from Intel, which is probably the leading
tech game in town, and that really frightened people into thinking
that perhaps some of the valuations in the tech area might be too
high,'' said Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's shares were down $12.92, or 21 percent, to $48.56.
</P>
<P>
   Technology investors began fleeing the market in after-hours
trading Thursday evening, and that exodus expanded in scope at
Friday's opening.
</P>
<P>
   Intel led the way, but other widely held technology stocks also
felt investors' wrath. Microsoft was down $1.45 at $62.73, Cisco
Systems fell $1.19 to $59.94, and Dell Computer dropped $2.38 to
$35.56.
</P>
<P>
   With third-quarter earnings season just a few weeks away and
increasing signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, investors have
been punishing stocks whose companies fail to meet their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Strength in a handful of blue chip sectors, including utilities
and drugs, helped staunch the selling momentum that threatened to
overwhelm the markets early in the session.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities sector, which has served as a haven for frightened
investors all year, was led by Duke Energy, up $1.38 at $76.
Pharmacia Corp., up $3.25 to $59.25, helped lift the drug sector.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 920.59 million
shares, well ahead of Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 2.06 to 512.29.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists, Hunters Clash  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill that would make it more difficult for
federal land managers to restrict hunting is fueling bitter debate
over access to land and whether hunting endangers campers, hikers
and bird watchers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Audubon Society says if the bill by Rep. Saxby
Chambliss, R-Ga., becomes law, visitors will need to wear bright
orange vests when they visit wildlife refuges.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunting Heritage Protection Act, backed by hunting
enthusiasts such as Reps. Collin Peterson, D-Minn., Don Young,
R-Alaska, would require that federal lands be opened to
recreational hunting unless national security, public safety or
other federal or state laws restrict the activity.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also calls for a ''no net loss'' of hunting on
federal lands. That means if federal land managers close an area to
hunting, they must open an equal amount of land elsewhere to
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   The bill ''is simply designed to put hunting on an equal plane
with all other outdoors activities on public lands,'' Chambliss
said. ''We've got too many public lands that people don't have
access to.''
</P>
<P>
   With only a few weeks remaining in this year's congressional
session, passage of the bill could be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration opposes the measure, contending it
would handcuff local land managers who need flexibility in managing
land, and the ''no net loss'' provision is unnecessary and would be
expensive, burdensome and too complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's certainly no move afoot to start wholesale closures at
all,'' said Rem Hawes, a Bureau of Land Management spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The 500,000-member Audubon Society, worried that Republicans
will make a late-session push to pass the bill, recently stepped up
opposition dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The group sent to each House member a flier with a bright orange
hunting vest on the cover bearing the inscription: ''Planning a
family trip to a national wildlife refuge? Better pack this.''
Inside, the flier warns the bill would place casual users of public
lands in closer proximity to hunting and gunfire, which could have
''catastrophic consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Horn, Washington counsel of the Wildlife Legislative Fund
of America, a pro-hunting group, called the flier ''one of the most
irresponsible, misrepresentative'' documents he has ever seen. He
said it is preposterous to think the bill would endanger anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Beard, Audubon Society senior vice president, said the flier
is accurate in describing the bill as making hunting the No. 1
priority on all federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Federal lands shouldn't become private hunting preserves,'' he
said. ''These lands are open for all of us to enjoy, not just one
special interest.''
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that hunting is and will continue to be a major
activity on federal land. Hunting is allowed on the most of the 549
million acres of national forest, BLM and federal wildlife refuge
land.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting advocates worry that federal agency proposals to
restrict road-building in national forests and limit off-road
vehicles on BLM lands also will limit hunters' access.
</P>
<P>
   The House Resources Committee, chaired by Young, approved the
bill earlier this summer and last week forwarded the measure to the
full House for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republican Rod Grams of Minnesota said he wants
to attach a similar proposal to a conservation bill that would
provide $3 billion a year to buy land, restore coastlines and
protect wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 4790.

<HEADLINE> 404 Slept Over At White House  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House made public the names of 404
overnight guests Friday to answer political charges that Hillary
Rodham Clinton rewarded big campaign donors by letting them stay in
the executive mansion or at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   All were guests since Mrs. Clinton announced as a Senate
candidate in July, 1999 and roughly one out of four contributed to
Mrs. Clinton's Senate race, her campaign said. The 404 guests --
more than one a day on average -- stayed at the White House over a
13-month period concluding Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''The campaign of innuendo here is without any basis,''
presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said. ''Who do you expect you'd
go to if you were running for office other than your friends?''
</P>
<P>
   The guests included longtime Democratic donors who contributed
more than $150,000 to President Clinton's legal defense fund,
including $30,000 from John Manning of Boston, chief executive
officer of Boston Capitol Corp.; $20,000 apiece from programming
executive Haim Sabin and his wife, Cheryl; $5,000 from actor Chevy
Chase and $90 from Nancy Adkins, a friend from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Another guest was Paul Adler, chairman of the Rockland County
Democratic Party in New York who was charged earlier this month
with public corruption after allegedly enriching himself by nearly
$375,000 through fraud, extortion and bribery. He donated $1,500 to
the first lady's campaign and hosted a fund raiser for her Senate
bid.
</P>
<P>
   Many donors made six-figure contributions to Democratic party
committees, led by former Slim-Fast head S. Daniel Abraham, who has
given $993,000 since Jan. 1, 1999. Other big donors include Norman
Pattiz, chairman of the Westwood One radio network, who has given
$300,000; and Vinod Gupta, president of InfoUSA, who has given
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta played host to a $1,000-a-person fund raiser for Mrs.
Clinton in March at his home in Omaha that raised about $100,000
for her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Another guest was Hollywood mogul Steven Spielberg, who gave
$10,000 to Clinton's legal defense fund, $140,000 to Democratic
party committees, and $7,000 to New York Senate 2000, a special
fund set up to raise money for Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign.
Actor Chevy Chase contributed to Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Other guest-donors were veteran Democratic fund-raiser Terence
McAuliffe and his family; and several New York political leaders,
including former state Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman,
Manhattan Borough President Virginia Fields, former Rep. Floyd
Flake and state Assemblyman Tom DiNapoli, the Nassau County
Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Also listed was a string of celebrities whose names do not
appear on campaign contribution lists for Mrs. Clinton: Meg Ryan
and her husband, Dennis Quaid; Danny Devito and his wife, Rhea
Perlman and Will Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, asked about the sleepovers, said,
''It is their private residence, but they have also said that this
is the people's house. You've just got to look at the particular
facts. If the president of the United States wants to invite
somebody to stay at his --what is, in effect, his home for a
four-year period or an eight-year period, he ought to be able to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unapologetic for the sleepovers, Lockhart said, ''The Clintons
will continue to invite guests to visit with them at the White
House and at Camp David during the president's remaining months in
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Guests included dozens of political figures, such as former
President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalyn; former Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, 13 governors and others.
</P>
<P>
   The list covered guests who stayed overnight from July 1, 1999,
when Mrs. Clinton began her ''listening tour'' in New York as a
prelude to her campaign for the Senate, through Aug. 31, 2000.

   The list was broken down into six categories: Arkansas friends,
51 people, longtime friends, 102, friends and supporters, 86,
officials and dignitaries, 77, arts and letters and sports, 45, and
family and friends of Chelsea Clinton, 43. The White House omitted

re-election campaign, his legal defense fund and his planned
post-presidential library.

her power by having contributors stay overnight.

<HEADLINE> Political Offices in Kosovo Burned  </HEADLINE>
By FISNIK ABRASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Attackers burned the local party
office of a key Kosovo political leader on Friday, marking an
increase in politically motivated violence only weeks before the
province holds its first U.N.-administered municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the offices of Hashim Thaci's party occurred just
after midnight. Party officials blamed their rivals in Kosovo's
largest party, which is run by moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova,
though U.N. police and NATO-led peacekeepers said the case was
still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was the second in as many days involving a key
political party in the province. On Thursday, four men burst into
the offices of Rugova's party in the town of Lipljan, 10 miles
south of Pristina, assaulting a local party leader and smashing
windows.
</P>
<P>
   The party leader was slightly injured and did not require
medical attention, said Maj. Scott Slaten, a spokesman for NATO-led
peacekeepers in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks have been increasing steadily in the last week since the
start of campaigning for Oct. 28 municipal elections. Though
overall control of the province will remain in the hands of U.N.
administrators and NATO-led peacekeepers, local officials are
campaigning vigorously because the races are seen as giving them
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, campaigning heated up in the provincial capital,
Pristina, where flamboyant political leader Ramush Haradinaj held a
rally to present his party's candidates for the city's municipal
council.
</P>
<P>
   As hundreds cheered and waved Albanian flags, the former
guerrilla leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army told supporters that
by voting for his party, the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, the
province will be guaranteed separation from Serbia, the dominant
republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged that Kosovo's image would improve under his party's
direction, moving closer to NATO and other Western institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of Western governments have helped Kosovo to come to the
position where it is today,'' he said. ''Their help is linked to
their inner public opinion. That's why we want to help that the
image of Kosovo during election time be a positive image.''

<HEADLINE> Retransmits to restore NY designator  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House made public the names of 404
overnight guests Friday to answer political charges that Hillary
Rodham Clinton rewarded big campaign donors by letting them stay in
the executive mansion or at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   All were guests since Mrs. Clinton announced as a Senate
candidate in July, 1999 and roughly one out of four contributed to
Mrs. Clinton's Senate race, her campaign said. The 404 guests -
more than one a day on average - stayed at the White House over a
13-month period concluding Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''The campaign of innuendo here is without any basis,''
presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said. ''Who do you expect you'd
go to if you were running for office other than your friends?''
</P>
<P>
   The guests included longtime Democratic donors who contributed
more than $150,000 to President Clinton's legal defense fund,
including $30,000 from John Manning of Boston, chief executive
officer of Boston Capitol Corp.; $20,000 apiece from programming
executive Haim Sabin and his wife, Cheryl; $5,000 from actor Chevy
Chase and $90 from Nancy Adkins, a friend from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Another guest was Paul Adler, chairman of the Rockland County
Democratic Party in New York who was charged earlier this month
with public corruption after allegedly enriching himself by nearly
$375,000 through fraud, extortion and bribery. He donated $1,500 to
the first lady's campaign and hosted a fund raiser for her Senate
bid.
</P>
<P>
   Many donors made six-figure contributions to Democratic party
committees, led by former Slim-Fast head S. Daniel Abraham, who has
given $993,000 since Jan. 1, 1999. Other big donors include Norman
Pattiz, chairman of the Westwood One radio network, who has given
$300,000; and Vinod Gupta, president of InfoUSA, who has given
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta played host to a $1,000-a-person fund raiser for Mrs.
Clinton in March at his home in Omaha that raised about $100,000
for her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Another guest was Hollywood mogul Steven Spielberg, who gave
$10,000 to Clinton's legal defense fund, $140,000 to Democratic
party committees, and $7,000 to New York Senate 2000, a special
fund set up to raise money for Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign.
Actor Chevy Chase contributed to Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Other guest-donors were veteran Democratic fund-raiser Terence
McAuliffe and his family; and several New York political leaders,
including former state Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman,
Manhattan Borough President Virginia Fields, former Rep. Floyd
Flake and state Assemblyman Tom DiNapoli, the Nassau County
Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Also listed was a string of celebrities whose names do not
appear on campaign contribution lists for Mrs. Clinton: Meg Ryan
and her husband, Dennis Quaid; Danny Devito and his wife, Rhea
Perlman and Will Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, asked about the sleepovers, said,
''It is their private residence, but they have also said that this
is the people's house. You've just got to look at the particular
facts. If the president of the United States wants to invite
somebody to stay at his -what is, in effect, his home for a
four-year period or an eight-year period, he ought to be able to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unapologetic for the sleepovers, Lockhart said, ''The Clintons
will continue to invite guests to visit with them at the White
House and at Camp David during the president's remaining months in
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Guests included dozens of political figures, such as former
President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalyn; former Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, 13 governors and others.
</P>
<P>
   The list covered guests who stayed overnight from July 1, 1999,
when Mrs. Clinton began her ''listening tour'' in New York as a
prelude to her campaign for the Senate, through Aug. 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The list was broken down into six categories: Arkansas friends,
51 people, longtime friends, 102, friends and supporters, 86,
officials and dignitaries, 77, arts and letters and sports, 45, and
family and friends of Chelsea Clinton, 43. The White House omitted

<HEADLINE> Reno Wants Review of Lee Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno told President
Clinton she has asked for an internal review of Justice Department
actions in the Wen Ho Lee case, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Clinton met privately at the White House to discuss the
case, which the president has called troubling. The two spoke for
about 45 minutes, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has asked the Office of Professional Responsibility to do
a thorough review, as is their practice ... when questions have
been raised about a prosecution like this one by a judge or
others,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The office Lockhart referenced is an internal watchdog at the
Justice Department. It was chosen by Reno to handle the review
because it normally reviews cases in which federal judges criticize
the department's handling of cases, a senior Justice official said,
requesting anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   This official said the review would start with criticisms made
by U.S. District Judge James Parker and would encompass the whole
handling of the case by the Justice Department and the FBI,
including Reno's role.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton said the nine months that former Los Alamos
nuclear scientist Lee spent in detention ''just can't be
justified.''
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Lee, a former Los Alamos laboratory scientist,
went free last week after pleading guilty to one felony of
mishandling weapons secrets. Lee placed sensitive information on
portable computer tapes, some of which are now missing.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Parker castigated prosecutors for keeping Lee behind bars
so long but Reno refused to apologize and said Lee could have ended
his detention earlier by agreeing to plead guilty and tell the
government what he did with the secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attorney general gave the president a sense of where they
are as far as looking at this. I think they both agree the most
important thing going on now is the debriefing process and trying
to find out just what happened to the computer tapes,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting, Reno said Clinton had been receptive and
understanding during a brief telephone discussion of the Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't go into detail, but we had a good conversation,''
Reno told her weekly news conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Reno said the telephone conversation occurred Wednesday
and lasted five to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a chance to discuss it, and he was thoughtful and
supportive,'' Reno said of the call. ''I think anybody who looks at
this case and doesn't know the circumstances of it is going to say,
'Why?' And I think that's what the president kind of naturally
asked.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis J. Freeh said ''the safety of the nation
demands that we take this important step'' under which Lee was
sentenced to the 278 days he had served. The government dropped 58
other counts, which could have carried a term of up to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Reno spoke, Clinton expressed an opinion far closer
to that of Judge Parker, who said Lee's detention ''embarrassed our
entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he found it difficult in retrospect to reconcile
how the government could ''keep someone in jail without bail, argue
right up to the 11th hour that they're a terrible risk, and then
turn around and make that sort of plea agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It just can't be justified. ... I too am quite troubled by
it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday why Clinton wasn't aware of the details earlier,
Reno replied, ''The president of the United States has taken great
care not to infringe in law enforcement decisions to avoid a
political charge that it's politically influenced. He has been very
good about that. ... I can't think of any case in which he has
interfered in any way that I consider inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Like everybody else, he said, 'How do you go from here to
here, and why did it happen?','' Reno added. Based on the telephone
conversation and the scheduled face-to-face session, she said, ''I
think he'll understand.''

<HEADLINE> Group Makes Stance on Hindu Prayers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Family Research Council, a leading
conservative advocacy group, issued a statement Friday to clarify
an Internet article that criticized the House for inviting a Hindu
to deliver the opening prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We affirm the truth of Christianity, but it is not our
position that America's Constitution forbids representatives of
religions other than Christianity from praying before Congress,''
FRC executive vice president Chuck Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognize that decisions on this matter are the prerogative
of each house of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The council, in an article on its World Wide Web page, said
allowing a Hindu priest to give the opening prayer was another
indication that the nation is drifting from its Judeo-Christian
roots.
</P>
<P>
   The Founding Fathers, the article said, ''would have found
utterly incredible the idea that all religions, including paganism,
be treated with equal deference.''
</P>
<P>
   A Hindu priest from Parma, Ohio, last week became the first
Hindu to give the House invocation. His prayer came on the day that
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee addressed a joint
meeting of Congress.

<HEADLINE> Rangel Questions Tax Panel  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior Democratic lawmaker raised questions
Friday about the political allegiance of a bipartisan panel that
provides official estimates and descriptions of tax legislation for
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, ranking Democrat on the House
Ways and Means Committee, said in a letter that the Joint Committee
on Taxation has failed to respond quickly to his request for
information about tax proposals made by Republican presidential
nominee George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rangel said the committee did react promptly
to requests from Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer,
R-Texas, for information about Democratic presidential candidate Al
Gore's tax relief plan.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity, Rangel said, ''leaves the impression that the
Joint Committee staff has chosen sides in the presidential race.
The only way to dispel that notion is to release as promptly as
possible the information we are seeking.''
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the letter, written to Joint Committee on
Taxation Chief of Staff Lindy Paull, Rangel added in longhand:
''This is very important to us. Thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Paull did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Paull
is a former staff director at the Senate Finance Committee, headed
by Republican Sen. William Roth of Delaware, but is generally
regarded by officials with both parties as running the panel in an
even-handed way.
</P>
<P>
   The information sought by Rangel concerns whether Bush's
10-year, $1.3 trillion tax cut would increase the number of
taxpayers subjected to the complex alternative minimum tax -- which
could reduce the number of people who might ultimately benefit from
the tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the proposal deals directly
with the AMT by continuing a current law that protects taxpayers
who claim personal credits, including the $500 per-child tax credit
Bush wants to double to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We account for it,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   However, because the AMT was never indexed for inflation and its
goal is to prevent people from escaping too much taxes through
legitimate means, under Gore or Bush more and more individuals are
likely to be subjected to it as incomes rise in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Holiday season could be make or break for National Record Mart's future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) - It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
might be a make-or-break sales season for National Record Mart Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The struggling Carnegie, Pa.-based music retail chain has
enacted $2 million in cost-cutting strategies, hired a consultant
to turn the business around, and begun negotiating new terms on $15
million in debt that comes due in April.
</P>
<P>
   But those plans, unveiled at a stockholders meeting on Thursday
by president and chief executive officer William Teitelbaum, won't
help long-term unless the chain starts making money - and the only
time that generally happens is during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't save your way to profitability,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   National Record Mart has 174 stores in Guam and 33 states,
including Pennsylvania, under the names National Record Mart, Waves
Music, Music X, Music Oasis and Vibes Music.
</P>
<P>
   The chain reported a loss of $1.60 a share in its last fiscal
year, which ended in March, and fell below capital requirements to
be listed on the Nasdaq stock index. Although National Record Mart
has appealed that fate it could soon drop off the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed at 88 cents Thursday, down from a 52-week high
of $6.13.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum blamed the financial woes on sluggish sales, overly
optimistic projections for newer stores, increasing competition,
and the ability of the store's target market - 15- to 28-year-olds
- to download music off of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to fold up. We're not going to die. We're not
going to cave,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't rule out selling the chain if finances don't
improve soon.
</P>
<P>
   National Record Mart plans to save $2 million by eliminating
five administrative positions at its Carnegie headquarters -
leaving it with 130 employees there; closing seven underperforming
stores; and consolidating bank accounts around the country to save
banking fees.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey-based investment banking and consulting firm that
National Record Mart hired, Policano and Manzo, has helped other
clients in the retail music business with turnarounds.
</P>
<P>
   Among other transactions, the consultants helped restructure the
bankrupt 482-store Camelot Music when it merged with Trans World
Entertainment Corp. of Albany, N.Y. last year.

<HEADLINE> French Prez Chirac Investigated  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA VON DERSCHAU
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Two investigators on Friday searched the offices of
a video production company that made a tape allegedly implicating
President Jacques Chirac in a campaign finance incident 14 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators, accompanied by police officers, went to
Sunset Presse, whose director, Arnaud Hamelin, made the video in
which a former member of Chirac's Rally for the Republic party,
reportedly describes handing over cash in Chirac's presence.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague of Hamelin, who refused to be named, said that
investigators seized the tape after a four-hour search.
</P>
<P>
   The Le Monde daily newspaper on Thursday published what it
claimed was the transcript of the video interview that Hamelin
conducted with Jean-Claude Mery, a property developer and one-time
member of the central committee of Chirac's party.
</P>
<P>
   In the transcript, Mery -- who was investigated for illegal party
funding in the 1980s and 1990s -- describes handing over $649,000 in
cash in 1986 to an official from the Rally for the Republic party
in the presence of Chirac, then the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac denied the Le Monde report Thursday, calling the
allegations ''outrageous'' and ''lies.'' Chirac did not comment on
further allegations in Friday's Le Monde in which Mery was quoted
as saying he worked only on Chirac's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Mery died in 1999, and the transcript was made available to Le
Monde, with his earlier agreement, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Le Monde quoted Mery as saying he collected between $4.5 million
and $5.2 million for political parties, including the Rally for the
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac is unlikely to become the target of an investigation
soon. Last year, the constitutional court ruled that Chirac can't
face criminal charges as long as he is president.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative politicians on Friday defended Chirac, with the
current Mayor Jean Tiberi calling the allegations ''lies.''

   PARIS (AP) -- Two investigators on Friday searched the offices of
a video production company that made a tape allegedly implicating
President Jacques Chirac in a campaign finance incident 14 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators, accompanied by police officers, went to
Sunset Presse, whose director, Arnaud Hamelin, made the video in
which a former member of Chirac's Rally for the Republic party,
reportedly describes handing over cash in Chirac's presence.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague of Hamelin, who refused to be named, said that
investigators seized the tape after a four-hour search.
</P>
<P>
   The Le Monde daily newspaper on Thursday published what it
claimed was the transcript of the video interview that Hamelin
conducted with Jean-Claude Mery, a property developer and one-time
member of the central committee of Chirac's party.
</P>
<P>
   In the transcript, Mery -- who was investigated for illegal party
funding in the 1980s and 1990s -- describes handing over $649,000 in
cash in 1986 to an official from the Rally for the Republic party
in the presence of Chirac, then the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac denied the Le Monde report Thursday, calling the
allegations ''outrageous'' and ''lies.'' Chirac did not comment on
further allegations in Friday's Le Monde in which Mery was quoted
as saying he worked only on Chirac's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Mery died in 1999, and the transcript was made available to Le
Monde, with his earlier agreement, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Le Monde quoted Mery as saying he collected between $4.5 million
and $5.2 million for political parties, including the Rally for the
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac is unlikely to become the target of an investigation
soon. Last year, the constitutional court ruled that Chirac can't
face criminal charges as long as he is president.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative politicians on Friday defended Chirac, with the
current Mayor Jean Tiberi calling the allegations ''lies.''

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Helene hits Florida Panhandle with heavy rains  </HEADLINE>
By DARA KAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - A rapidly weakening Tropical Storm
Helene sloshed ashore Friday in the Florida Panhandle, bringing
bands of heavy rain but only minor damage.
</P>
<P>
   Helene had dumped 7.75 inches of rain on Tallahassee by 2 p.m.,
flooding roads, ditches and a couple of apartment buildings, said
Ann Rowe, a spokeswoman for the Florida Division of Emergency
Management.
</P>
<P>
   The storm spun off at least six tornados south of Tallahassee,
but no significant damage was reported in the lightly populated
area, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What storm?'' asked Charles Ingram, 62, a retired paper mill
worker, at breakfast at Linda's Restaurant in Port St. Joe, which
got some of the heaviest rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an awful lot of water standing around, which we
need,'' Ingram said. ''We had a lot of lightning, a lot of rain,
but not much damage. It's just business as usual. We planned for
it, sandbagged and everything, but it didn't come.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools throughout the Panhandle and state offices in
Tallahassee had closed in anticipation of the storm. Power outages
left 5,000 people in the dark and Tallahassee buses stopped running
during the storm, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Helene's center made landfall with top winds near 45 mph - down
from 65 mph - at about 8 a.m. near Fort Walton Beach, but the
heaviest rain of up to 8 inches was 100 to 150 miles east of the
center, including Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get geared up and don't get hit; who's complaining?'' said
Craig Fugate, leader of the state's emergency response team in
Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m. the center of Helene, downgraded to a tropical
depression with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph, was 20 miles
north of Dothan, Ala. It was moving northeast at 16 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Nelson, Gulf County emergency management coordinator,
estimated between $100,000 to $300,000 in road and beach erosion
damage at Cape San Blas.
</P>
<P>
   About 130 people stayed in shelters overnight, mostly in
Escambia and Santa Rosa counties, in the western end of the
Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Some flood warnings remained in effect for parts of Florida,
including areas still soggy from the weekend passage of Tropical
Storm Gordon. A flood watch was posted in northern Georgia.
Tropical storm warnings, which had stretched from Pascagoula,
Miss., to southeast of Tallahassee, were lifted after the storm
made landfall.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Isaac, which strengthened from a
depression late Thursday, was in the far eastern Atlantic on Friday
and posed no threat to land. The storm, with maximum sustained
winds of nearly 50 mph, moving toward the west-northwest at nearly
18 mph.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Release Oil From Reserve  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has directed some limited
release of oil from the government's emergency reserve in an
attempt to drive down oil prices, an administration source said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made after a meeting with key advisers at the
White House and a day after Vice President Al Gore urged the
president to use the reserve as leverage to try to head off soaring
heating oil costs this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson scheduled a news conference on
oil issues later Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Details of how much oil will be released or the timetable could
not immediately be learned.
</P>
<P>
   Oil was last released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in
1991 during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials briefed some members of Congress on the
release. Northeast lawmakers have clamored for use of the
government oil to rein in oil prices, which in recent days peaked
at nearly $38 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Pennsylvania, Gore, the Democratic presidential
candidate, reiterated his call Friday for use of the oil reserve --
a government stockpile of 571 million barrels of crude -- to ease
tight oil supplies and reduce prices.
</P>
<P>
   He urged a release of 30 million to 35 million barrels ''over
the next month'' to stem the increase in home heating oil prices.
On Thursday, Gore called upon Clinton to release 5 million barrels
initially, followed by several other releases of about the same
amount.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed oil release brought sharp criticism from
Republicans including Gore's rival, George W. Bush, a former Texas
oil man, who said that the reserve was designed to address critical
supply interruptions and not to manipulate the market.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning Friday in Florida, condemned Clinton's
decision to tap the reserve. ''The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is
meant for a national emergency, a national war, a major disruption
of supply. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve should not be used a
short-term political fix for somebody whose administration has been
asleep at the switch.
</P>
<P>
   The government reserve, created in 1973, has been used only once
in response to an oil emergency -- when former President Bush
ordered a partial drawdown because of supply disruptions from the
Middle East caused by the Gulf War. The move, and production
increases internationally, maintained market stability and kept oil
prices down during the six-week conflict between U.S.-led forces
and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear what impact a modest injection of
government-owned oil into the market will have on prices. Some
analysts have said it probably would have little more than a
psychological effect as a signal from the government that it is
willing to intervene
</P>
<P>
   American refineries use about 14 million barrels of oil a day
and the country consumes 18.6 million barrels of oil products
daily.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said Friday that any drawdown of U.S. reserve would cause
only a temporary dip in world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prices will fall, but the effect will be temporary,'' Ali
Rodriguez, who is Venezuela's oil minister as well as OPEC's
president, said in a televised interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said the world market needs so-called sweet crude to ease
shortages of products such as gasoline, while the U.S. strategic
reserve mainly consists of solid crude.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the reserve to try to impact prices has been the subject
of intense debate within the White House for months. Last spring,
when oil prices soared and gasoline costs skyrocketed, the
president's advisers were largely opposed to intervention.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, views began to change, according to a
senior White House official.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is different is that you've got more people feeling this
is ... might be justified,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. He said a key factor was a realization that
a series of decisions by OPEC oil producers to increase production
was not having the expected effect of reducing oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in focusing on the oil price issue and calling for
intervention, also brought new pressure on the White House to act.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of leveling off at about $22 to $25 a barrel, oil has
stayed above $30 a barrel and soared to nearly $38 a barrel in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, November crude was trading down $1.32 at $32.68 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

<HEADLINE> British Court OKs Twin Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The Court of Appeal ruled Friday that surgeons may
separate 1&AMP;frac12;-month-old Siamese twins against the wishes of their
Roman Catholic parents, but the agonizing moral and medical issues
could go to the House of Lords, Britain's highest court, if the
parents wish.
</P>
<P>
   The judges concluded the case came down to an issue of
self-defense -- the right of the stronger twin to be released from a
sister who would eventually kill them both.
</P>
<P>
   In their unanimous decision, the three-judge panel expressed
sympathy with the cruel reality faced by parents whose daughters
are ''equal in their eyes and in their love.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The sad fact is that (the weaker twin) lives on borrowed time,
all of it borrowed from her sister,'' said Lord Justice Alan Ward.
''She is incapable of independent existence. She is designated for
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the girls, identified only as Jodie and Mary, will
die within months if they are not separated, but that Jodie could
live on her own.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, who were determined to submit to ''God's will,''
had appealed a lower court ruling in favor of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The case may not be over -- the parents were permitted to appeal
Friday's decision to the House of Lords, Britain's highest court,
although they were uncertain whether they would do so.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, identified only as Roman Catholics from the Maltese
island of Gozo in the Mediterranean, came to Britain for the Aug. 8
birth of the twins, who were joined at the lower abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no suggestion the parents wish to take the twins
back to Gozo, a 26-square-mile island with a population of 5,000,
and the court has not issued any order requiring the children to
remain in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Following today's judgment, the parents will consider the
advice they are given and whether to launch an appeal,'' said John
Kitchingham, the family's lawyer, adding that his clients
appreciated the court's ''most detailed consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   The court had struggled with the issue of whether the surgery
would amount to intentionally killing Mary, whose heart and lungs
cannot sustain life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mary's death would not be the purpose of the operation,
although it would be its inevitable consequence. The operation
would give her, even in death, bodily integrity as a human being.
She would die, not because she was intentionally killed, but
because her own body cannot sustain her life,'' Justice Robert
Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Two medical specialists appointed by the court to review the
case endorsed surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, summarizing the judgment, said, ''Though Mary has a right
to life, she has little right to be alive. She is alive because and
only because -- to put it bluntly but nonetheless accurately -- she
sucks the lifeblood of Jodie, and her parasitic living will soon be
the cause of Jodie ceasing to live.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Jodie is entitled to protest that Mary is killing her. Nobody
but the doctors can help Jodie. Mary sadly is beyond any help,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am therefore left in no doubt at all that the scales come
down heavily in Jodie's favor,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Oates, a lawyer appointed to represent Mary's
interests, said he would consider an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''In reaching that decision I shall wish to take careful account
of the parents' views and wishes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been my concern to ensure that all arguments on behalf
of Mary should be taken into account in the consideration of these
issues,'' he said. ''I am satisfied that this has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents, in a statement read in court on Sept. 4, said they
had come to England ''to give our babies the very best chance for
life in the very best place.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now things have gone very badly wrong and we find ourselves in
this very difficult situation. ... We believe that nature should
take its course. If it's God's will that both our children should
not survive then so be it,'' they said.

<HEADLINE> Rutgers' minority graduation rate doubles in last decade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - Rutgers University's graduation rate
for minority students has doubled in the past decade, its president
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As a percentage of total degrees conferred, minorities accounted
for 35 percent of graduates in 1999, up from 17 percent in 1989,
president Francis L. Lawrence said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have fostered a climate of respect for all people, valued
the contributions they make to our community, and taken steps to
provide forums and facilities for groups of all kinds to share in
the diversity that is, to my mind, this institution's most precious
human endowment,'' Lawrence said in his annual state of the
university address.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence created a furor in 1994 when during a discussion on why
minority students tend to have lower test scores, suggested they
might lack ''that genetic hereditary background to have a higher
average.'' The remarks generated widespread criticism, and some
faculty tried to obtain a no-confidence vote in Lawrence,
criticizing his leadership on several fronts, but the university
allowed Lawrence to remain in his job.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Friday, Lawrence also noted that Rutgers has
nearly doubled the number of its doctoral programs ranked among the
nation's top 30 by the National Research Council since 1982, and
cited an increase in the university's sponsored research from $90.7
million in 1989 to $165.9 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen applications rose by nearly 25 percent over the last
decade, from 21,379 in 1989 to 26,250 last year, and the
university's endowment has more than tripled over that time, from
$112 million to $385 million.

<HEADLINE> Congress Moves on Prescriptions  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unable to find a way to expand prescription
drug coverage for seniors, Congress is moving toward the smaller
step of allowing the reimportation of U.S.-made prescription drugs
sold cheaper abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, while not finalized, aims to allow pharmacists
and drug wholesale distributors to import U.S. drugs sold abroad.
The Food and Drug Administration would be required to certify that
all reimported drugs are safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent and a leading
proponent of the measure, says the increased competition could
lower the prices of drugs by 30 to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said he had made two trips with his constituents to
Canada, where they found U.S.-made drugs costing as little as
one-tenth the price of the same drug in the United States. His
bill, he said, would ''end the outrage of paying by far the highest
prices in the world. All we want is fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., a chief sponsor in the Senate, said
the measure could have billions of dollars in impact because
''pharmacies and distributors will simply access a cheaper supply,
forcing the industry to re-price.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is fiercely opposed by the pharmaceutical
industry, which contends that transport and middlemen costs would
eat away any savings and that the FDA lacks the resources to
guarantee safe products.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why bother if it's going to cost so much money and so many
resources and still jeopardizes patient safety?'' asked Jeff
Trewhitt of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,
which has launched an intense lobbying and ad campaign to stop the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Trewhitt said that what Congress should be doing is expanding
drug coverage under an improved Medicare program. But that's
unlikely to happen this year, with Republicans and Democrats at
deep philosophical odds over whether the private sector or the
government should take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, congressional leaders are looking at the reimportation
bill to show they are listening, in this election year, to seniors
suffering from the high costs of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has spoken to his
Republican colleagues on the need to pass the legislation, said his
spokesman John Feehery. ''He supports it as long as we have the
proper safeguards.'' Feehery said, adding that politically it would
''definitely help some people, particularly in border states.''
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate passed differing drug reimportation bills
last July as part of the agriculture spending bill for fiscal 2001.
The two chambers, however, have made no progress in working out a
compromise farm bill because of differences over the drug and other
issues such as easing sanctions on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri took to the
House floor last week to urge the GOP leadership to move the bill.
''It would mean that millions of seniors could buy drugs at a
fraction of the current cost. It is sensible, it has bipartisan
support in both bodies, it sailed through the Congress and the
American people are for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorgan said he was optimistic but cautioned, ''don't
underestimate the pharmaceutical industry; they are spending a
fortune trying to defeat this.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has voiced guarded support. Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala wrote in a letter to Congress this
week that, in absence of a more comprehensive prescription drug
bill, reimportation was a ''promising approach, but it can only be
effective if Congress provides new and sufficient resources'' to
ensure drug safety.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Two bull moose hit in separate Adirondack accidents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TUPPER LAKE, N.Y. (AP) - One bull moose was killed and another
was injured in two separate accidents in the western Adirondack
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   State police said both accidents happened within 45 minutes of
each other Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The first moose hit was a 700-pound male estimated to be 1&AMP;frac12;
years old. It was struck and killed by a pickup truck on Route 3 in
the St. Lawrence County town of Piercefield.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers said the other moose, estimated at 3&AMP;frac12; years old and
1,000 pounds, was hit around 8:45 p.m. on Route 30 in the Franklin
County town of Altamont. It walked from the shoulder of the road
into the path of another pickup truck, but walked away after the
collision and was unable to be found.
</P>
<P>
   One passenger in the second vehicle, 10-year-old David Tokarz,
suffered scrapes to his lower leg but was not treated. There were
no other injuries reported, troopers said.
</P>
<P>
   Such accidents are common in the fall. It's in the genes,
scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the time of year when moose are most on the move,''
said Alan C. Hicks, a senior wildlife biologist with the New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation. ''They're looking
for women. They'll follow these females around for days.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks estimated the state's moose population at slightly more
than 100, but he said nobody's really sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's based on a whole lot of assumptions, none of which we can
test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moose started returning to New York in 1980. In the past decade,
there have been 23 collisions between moose and motorists in New
York. The first was June 23, 1990, when state officials estimated
the moose population at 15 to 30 animals.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, there have been two other vehicle-moose
collisions, both on the New York State Thruway, according to state
officials.

<HEADLINE> Germany To Ship Used Nuke Fuel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany said Friday it will resume international
shipments of spent nuclear fuel for reprocessing, ending a
moratorium imposed more than two years ago after containers
carrying the fuel were found to leak more radiation than allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Office for Radiation Protection said it approved as
many as eight shipments to take place this year from three German
nuclear power stations to a reprocessing plant in the French port
of La Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which is also considering dozens more applications
for nuclear shipments from power companies, said it gave its
approval after checking that French containers to be sent to
collect the fuel will keep emissions within internationally agreed
limits.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-border shipments were stopped in May 1998, after it
emerged that radioactive contamination of the surface of the
containers had exceeded safety limits for years.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-nuclear groups, who have regularly disrupted the transport
of radioactive material, said they would try to block the
shipments.
</P>
<P>
   Transports of nuclear fuel and waste have long been bitterly
opposed by environmentalists, including the Greens party that is
now the junior partner in the Social Democrat-led government.
</P>
<P>
   The center-left coalition and power companies struck a deal in
June to scrap the country's 19 nuclear plants, though the shutdown
could still take well over 20 years to complete.

<HEADLINE> Spain Mourns Death of Politician  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Tens of thousands of people marched in
silence through the center of this Mediterranean city Friday to
protest the assassination of a politician blamed on Basque
separatists.
</P>
<P>
   The march came hours after friends and family mourned at the
funeral of Jose Luis Ruiz Casado, a 42-year-old town councilor for
the ruling Popular Party, gunned down in a Barcelona suburb as he
went to work on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   State-run news agency EFE said an estimated 120,000 people
snaked through the main avenues of Spain's second-largest city
carrying banners that read ''That's enough!'' Regional president
Jordi Pujol and well-known singer Joan Manuel Serrat took part.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to drown our voices in blood,'' actress Vicky Pena
told demonstrators. ''They won't succeed. We are not indifferent to
the barbarity of the terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous killings claimed by the Basque armed group ETA also
sparked mass public protests.
</P>
<P>
   Following Thursday's shooting, traffic jams seven miles long
clogged Barcelona's outskirts as police searched cars leaving the
city for the three reported assassins.
</P>
<P>
   Police say two men killed Ruiz Casado while a woman waited in
the getaway car. The car was found abandoned near the scene. Police
say the killers may still be in the city.
</P>
<P>
   At least five witnesses described the killers to police, the El
Pais newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The attack followed the arrests of 29 suspected ETA members in
the past week in France and Spain and coincided with a visit to
Barcelona by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
</P>
<P>
   ETA has not claimed responsibility for the assassination, but it
did acknowledge Friday killing another town councilor and wounding
a former politician in the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A statement in the militant Basque newspaper Gara, the
traditional forum for ETA to claim responsibility for attacks, said
the separatists killed town councilor Manuel Indiano of the Popular
Party Aug. 29 in the Basque town of Zumarraga. Indiano, 29, was
shot seven times in the chest in his candy shop.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, ETA shot former Socialist politician Jose Ramon
Recalde in the face last week in the Basque city of San Sebastian.
Recalde, 68, survived the attack. The statement did not mention
Thursday's killing.
</P>
<P>
   ETA has claimed 12 of the 13 killings blamed on the group since
it called off its 14-month cease-fire last December.
</P>
<P>
   The separatists also carried out five bomb attacks on Basque
businesses in August for ''refusing to pay the Basque liberation
tax,'' the statement said. The bombs caused damage but no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ETA has killed about 800 people since 1968 when it began its
terrorist campaign for independence of the Basque region of
northern Spain.

<HEADLINE> Air Traffic Delays Up in August  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airline delays increased again in August,
after tapering off a bit earlier this summer, the Federal Aviation
Administration said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency reported 47,893 delayed flights for the month, up
from 44,430 in July but below the record 50,114 recorded in June.
</P>
<P>
   The August total was also well above the 37,189 delayed flights
in August a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Delayed and canceled flights have proved a major annoyance this
summer with weather and air traffic control problems. A pilot
dispute at United Airlines also lead to many canceled flights.
</P>
<P>
   The problems grew to the level that congressional hearings were
called. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater called a summit
meeting of airline officials and announced that a task force will
begin monitoring their performance.
</P>
<P>
   In August, 33,339 airline delays were recorded due to weather.
That is slightly from July but still very high historically, the
FAA said. There were 34,611 weather-related delays a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thunderstorms in August continued to have an adverse impact on
the National Airspace System just as they did in June and July,''
the agency said, noting that during the month the National Weather
Service issued 5,234 thunderstorm warnings, a 10 percent increase
over August of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Another major cause of delays was simply the increasing volume
of flights as more and more people want to fly. Often, more flights
are scheduled at the same time than an airport can handle.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,397 delays due to volume were up from 3,376 last August
and 4,106 in July of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said this reflects the increase in traffic at the
busiest airports, particularly New York City's La Guardia, where
flights there were up 4.5 percent over August of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''When an airport that is scheduled over its capacity for
portions of the day receives even a small amount of additional
flights, it will usually experience a dramatic increase both in
delays and their duration,'' the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   Delays in the other or miscellaneous category totaled 5,745, up
from 3,365 in July. The FAA said this was primarily due to
restrictions on the use of ''land and hold short'' operations at
some major airports. Some 1,831 delays were attributed to this in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Land and hold short is a system under which arriving pilots
stops before crossing another runway, to allow another plane to
depart. This can increase traffic at an airport, but it has been
eliminated at some airports where pilots contend it may not be
safe.
</P>
<P>
   Other delay causes listed in August were equipment problems,
452, up from 217 a month earlier, and runways, 2,960, up from 2,139
in July.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of flights in August was 14,911,621, up from
14,588,822 a month earlier.

<HEADLINE> Sprint to Marlboro Township: Hold the phone  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MARLBORO TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Sprint PCS is suing the first New
Jersey town to ban the use of cellular telephones by drivers,
saying only the state - not one of its municipalities - has
jurisdiction over highway safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the township is standing by the ban, which was enacted July
13.
</P>
<P>
   ''Corporate pecuniary gain will not come at the expense of
health and safety,'' town officials said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Spring PCS, a wireless telephone company, filed suit in Superior
Court in Freehold on Aug. 25, but town officials didn't find out
until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ban, anyone caught driving while using a hand-held
cell phone is subject to a fine of up to $250. Hands-free cell
phones are not prohibited, nor is talking on a cell phone when the
vehicle is not in motion.
</P>
<P>
   The Township Council's passage of the ban came two days after a
Pennsylvania judge struck down a similar ordinance in Bucks County,
ruling that Hilltown Township did not have the power to pre-empt
state motor vehicle laws.
</P>
<P>
   That is the same point being made by Sprint PCS. The suit, which
named the five members of the Township Council as defendants, asks
the court to invalidate the ordinance because it is superseded by
state statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's lawyer in the case, Steven Hambro, did not return
telephone calls seeking comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Town officials aren't backing down, though.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to bring this growing public-safety issue to
the forefront and will not be dissuaded by this ill-founded
lawsuit,'' said Barry Denkensohn, vice president of the council.
</P>
<P>
   The ban has yet to be enforced. Town officials are seeking state
Department of Transportation approval for street signs warning
motorists of the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Once the signs go up, police will begin enforcing it, Denkensohn
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The intent is not to bust people. The primary aim is
deterrence. We're not out to initiate a witch hunt. We're out to
deter people from using this particular device so we don't have
serious or fatal accidents,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lazio says soft money agreement is done - Clinton spox says no way  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKWOOD, N.Y. (AP) - While Rep. Rick Lazio said Friday that
there was a deal with Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign to ban soft
money from the New York Senate race, a spokesman for the first lady
rejected Lazio's contention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe we have an historic agreement,'' Lazio said after a
campaign stop outside a defense contractor's plant. He added later,
''I am basing this on what I believe to be the case and I think if
what she's offering is that neither side either raise or spend any
soft money and that we keep all outside groups out, than that's the
basis of a solid deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal has not yet been signed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said not only had a deal not
been signed - there was no deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate Congressman Lazio has not accepted our offer.
We were hoping he would respond to Hillary's simple offer by saying
one word - OK - instead we got more double-talk,'' Wolfson said.
''We're hoping he'll reconsider.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Wolfson's statement, Lazio's campaign later released a
letter from his campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, to Clinton campaign
officials saying he was glad a deal had been worked out and saying
he expected all Clinton's soft-money ads to be pulled by Monday. He
said Lazio's campaign would do the same.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton said during discussions about an agreement that
soft money ads already paid for would run through next week.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has been pushing to ban all soft-money spending, making it
a major issue during the candidates' debate Sept. 12. On Friday,
Clinton made a counteroffer, but the two sides apparently couldn't
agree on details.
</P>
<P>
   A major sticking point appeared to be Lazio's insistence that
outside groups supporting Clinton, such as the National Abortion
and Reproductive Rights Action League and the AFL-CIO, also abide
by the agreement. That requirement had appeared to have been taken
off the table by the Lazio camp in discussions Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In her offer Friday, Clinton said she would urge political
parties backing her not to buy any more issue ads on radio and TV
if Lazio did the same.
</P>
<P>
   She also wants groups closely associated with the Republican and
Conservative parties to agree to the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's make it simple, effective, enforceable and fair,''
Clinton said at a breakfast meeting of the Westchester Women for
Hillary group.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters later that she included ''other groups''
in the clause for Lazio because, ''The groups supporting his
campaign are clearly related to the Republican Party. They're not
individual institutional organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she already has an agreement from the Democratic
Party to stop funding soft money TV and radio ads, and will ask the
Liberal Party and the Working Families Party to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party leader Judith Hope and Sen. Robert G.
Torricelli, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, both said Friday they would abide by an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had answered Lazio's demand for a soft money ban by
saying she would not stop using soft money unless Lazio got
agreements from groups supporting him to halt anti-Clinton ads.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he produced documents signed by 14 groups she had
named. Each said they would agree to the ban.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said some groups have ''sent their own letters still
with hedges and conditions and dodges and of course, the Republican
party is missing.''
</P>
<P>
   State GOP Chairman William Powers has suspended pro-Lazio ads
during negotiations for a ban but stopped short of saying he would
still hold off should an agreement be reached. But Dal Col said
Thursday that ''I think we will be able to get everyone in line''
if a deal is worked out.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, head of the AFL-CIO, said he would not go along
with a soft money ban.
</P>
<P>
   Hard money contributions are limited to $2,000 per donor. There
is no limit on soft money contributions; they can be used to
advocate an issue, boost one candidate or attack an opposing
candidate, but such ads cannot end with a tag line asking voters to
choose a particular candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign has already raised millions of dollars in
soft money; Lazio's campaign does not have its own soft-money
account but has benefited from soft-money spending by outside
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Should soft money be banned, Lazio could have an advantage
because the latest federal filings showed his campaign had more
hard money than hers - $10.2 million to $7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a signed agreement, Lazio also wants all soft
money accounts to be refunded or placed in escrow accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said that under the first lady's proposed agreement, her
soft-money committees would stop advertising, but could continue to
raise funds and would make no refunds of money already collected.
</P>
<P>
   That means that should the agreement break down later, the
Clinton camp would be poised to resume heavy advertising paid for
with soft-money funds.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said it would be illegal for the Clinton campaign to
transfer normal campaign expenses, such as staff members' salaries,
her travel costs or fund-raising expenses for her regular campaign
committee to the soft-money accounts.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Church Zoning Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill President Clinton signed on Friday
prevents municipalities from using zoning laws as a ''keep out''
sign against churches or temples they don't want inside their city
limits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Religious liberty is a constitutional value of the highest
order,'' Clinton said in a statement issued after he signed the
bill. ''This act recognizes the importance the free exercise of
religion plays in our democratic society.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious groups had argued in favor of the Religious Land Use
and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, saying that cities and
towns have tried to use zoning laws to stop them from building new
churches or temples, or moving into their area.
</P>
<P>
   Some city officials have deliberately excluded all new churches
from an entire city, said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., who worked
to get measure passed. In other cities, officials have refused to
let churches use buildings previously used by nonreligious
assemblies, and some intentionally have changed the boundary of a
zone to exclude a church, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who also pushed
the measure, said lawmakers heard one case involving a Latter Day
Saints church that was kept from constructing a temple simply
because it was not in the ''aesthetic'' interests of a community.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, land use regulations that hinder the
construction of religious buildings must be justified by a
compelling government interest. Also, religious organizations
cannot be totally zoned out of a jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, however, does not exempt churches from zoning. If a
religious organization cannot prove that the regulations puts a
''substantial burden'' on sincere religious exercise, its claim
fails.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also protects the right of prisoners to practice
their religion as long as it does not disrupt the security,
discipline or order of their institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said prisoners and mental health patients have been
prevented from practicing their faith, including simple things like
letting Jewish prisoners have matzo and unleavened bread during
Passover even when Jewish groups donated the food for free.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is S. 2869.

<HEADLINE> Some White House guests are big Democratic donors  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   From former Slim-Fast executive S. Daniel Abraham to
VH-1 chief
executive John Sykes, dozens of overnight guests at the White House
and Camp David doubled as financial supporters of President
Clinton, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore
or the Democratic Party.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They include:
</P>
<P>
   - Abraham, who recently sold Slim-Fast to Unilever. He has given
$993,000 to Democratic Party committees since Jan. 1, 1999 - more
than any other individual donor - and $20,000 to Clinton's legal
defense fund.
</P>
<P>
   -Steven Spielberg. The movie director and producer hosted a
million-dollar fund-raiser for the Democrats in Hollywood last
April. Since Jan. 1, 1999, he has given $140,000 to the Democratic
National Committee, plus $7,000 to New York Senate 2000 and $10,000
to Clinton's legal defense fund. Mrs. Clinton has occasionally
stayed overnight at Spielberg's Trump Towers apartment in Manhattan
instead of driving home to Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   - Paul Adler, Rockland County, N.Y., Democratic chairman, who
gave $1,500 to Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign and hosted a
fund-raiser for her. He recently was charged with public corruption
for allegedly enriching himself by nearly $375,000 through fraud,
extortion and bribery.
</P>
<P>
   - Chevy Chase, actor and comedian. He contributed $5,000 to
Clinton's legal defense fund.
</P>
<P>
   - Jill and Kenneth Iscol of Pound Ridge, N.Y. Both contributed
to Mrs. Clinton's and Gore's campaigns. They also have given
$18,500 to the Democratic National Committee; $16,000 to New York
Senate 2000, the soft-money account set up by the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee to help Mrs. Clinton's candidacy; and
$6,000 to the New York State Democratic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   - Quincy Jones, music producer. He gave $1,000 to Gore's primary
campaign, $1,000 to Gore's general election legal and accounting
fund, $10,000 to New York Senate 2000, and $10,000 to the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   - Howard Kessler, owner of Kessler Financial Services in Boston.
He has given $95,000 to the Democratic National Committee, $10,000
to the DSCC, and $1,000 apiece to Gore and Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   -Terry McAuliffe, Democratic fund-raiser extraordinaire,
chairman of the 2000 national convention corporation in Los
Angeles, and golfing buddy of the president. McAuliffe directed a
Democratic fund-raiser/concert last May that brought in $26.5
million, a record one-day haul for either major political party. He
also has helped raise money for Clinton's legal defense fund and
his presidential library.
</P>
<P>
   -Cathy McDonald, who gave $1,000 to Mrs. Clinton's campaign. She
and her husband, Thomas, hosted the Clintons at their Skaneateles,
N.Y., home the last two summers. Thomas McDonald has an outstanding
state tax bill of $938,357.48. A tax warrant against him was issued
in October 1999. His lawyer said the builder also has an
outstanding federal income tax bill. - Sykes, whose VH-1 music
channel is owned by Viacom, the company that recently merged with
CBS. He has contributed $1,000 apiece to Mrs. Clinton's and Gore's
campaigns, plus $5,000 to Clinton's legal defense fund. Earlier
this month, he helped put together a $6.5-million Democratic
National Committee fund-raiser at Radio City Music Hall.

<HEADLINE> Three Columbians Accused of Kidnap  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Police arrested three members of a
leftist guerrilla band Friday, accusing them of helping plan and
execute the mass kidnapping of 80 people last weekend from
restaurants along a major highway.
</P>
<P>
   In early morning raids, police in the western city of Cali
captured two men and a woman identified as members of the National
Liberation Army, known as the ELN.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily-armed ELN fighters seized 80 hostages in daylight raids
last Sunday on two family restaurants and an estate on the Via Al
Mar, or Highway to the Sea, a route linking Cali with the Pacific
coast.
</P>
<P>
   With troops surrounding the mountainous area, rebels have
released 37 people but are reportedly demanding ransoms for the
others.
</P>
<P>
   The three captives, Ruben Gomez, Gerardo Benitez and Martha
Rengifo, were all suspected members of an urban ELN undercover cell
in Cali, Colombia's third-largest city, a police statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Details were not given on the suspects' alleged roles in the
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Police also confiscated ''combat and terrorism manuals,'' ELN
armbands, rebel intelligence reports and a computer containing
lists of potential kidnap victims and letters demanding ransoms,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappings have cast doubt over preliminary peace talks
that had been underway between the government and the ELN,
Colombia's second-largest guerrilla group.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Buchanan is Reform nominee  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Pat Buchanan is the Reform Party's
nominee for president and should be listed as such on the
Connecticut ballot, the chief justice of the state Supreme Court
ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Francis McDonald Jr. ordered state election
officials to list Buchanan and running mate Ezola Foster as the
Reform nominees - not a rival ticket headed by physicist John
Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's ruling came after three days of testimony in a
lawsuit filed by Buchanan's supporters, who said failing to list
Buchanan as the Reform nominee would prevent Connecticut voters
from hearing the party's message and decrease the number of votes
Buchanan receives nationally. The Reform Party hopes to receive at
least 5 percent of the national vote in order to retain its federal
matching funds in the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's one-page order did not list any reasons for his
decision, but indicated that a memorandum explaining the decision
will be issued later. Both sides in the dispute had agreed to skip
over lower courts and argue the case directly before the high
court.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Federal Election Commission released to Buchanan
$12.6 million in federal campaign funds belonging to the Reform
Party, an action supporters said backed up their claim that
Buchanan deserved the Reform line on Connecticut's ballot.
Buchanan's supporters also cited a ruling by a California judge
earlier this month declaring that Buchanan was the Reform nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason for McDonald's decision, Buchanan's
supporters were thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ''This court decision is a major victory, not only for the
Reform Party of Connecticut, but also for reformers across the
country,'' said Cherilyn Gulbrandsen of New Canaan, state
chairwoman of the Buchanan campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ''not only deals with what can happen with minor
parties but major parties,'' Gulbrandsen said. ''We have an
obligation to put on the (state) ballot those nominated at national
conventions.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan and Hagelin each claimed the Reform mantle at competing
conventions in Long Beach, Calif., last month. Buchanan's
supporters say Hagelin's backers walked out of the original event,
while Hagelin's supporters maintain they were ''locked out'' by
pro-Buchanan forces.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin supporter Donna Donovan said she was stunned at
McDonald's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we presented substantial evidence in the court that
this so-called Buchanan convention was as phony as a three-dollar
bill, and that the Buchanan supporters here in Connecticut are just
as phony in their effort to make an end-run around the real Reform
Party,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   But John Conway, a lawyer for the Buchanan backers, said
McDonald, in his decision, ''recognized that if you walk away and
don't play by the rules, you suffer the consequences. The people at
the Reform Party who stayed (at the original Long Beach event) and
played by the rules nominated Buchanan and Foster.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz, one of the defendants in
the case, said Friday she would comply with McDonald's order. Her
office will send a letter to all 169 city and town clerks directing
them to list Buchanan as the Reform nominee on absentee ballots,
Bsyiewicz said. Absentee ballots in Connecticut are printed
locally, not by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also qualified for the presidential ballot on the new
Freedom Party line, but will not be listed as the Freedom nominee,
Bysiewicz said. State law prevents a candidate from being listed on
more than one ballot line.
</P>
<P>
   Gulbrandsen called the Freedom party ''a back-up'' plan, and
said Buchanan's name will be withdrawn from the Freedom line.

<HEADLINE> Agency Upgrades Ford Investigation  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are investigating whether a
recall of 136,300 Saturn vehicles with faulty seat recliners is
broad enough to include all potentially defective vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn Corp., a division on General Motors Corp., recalled some
1994-1995 model years in March 1999 because their seat backs can
recline or collapse suddenly. The recall was limited to Saturns
built in 1994 between Jan. 31 and Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is uncertain
about more than 400,000 Saturns from the same model years but built
outside those dates.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 328 complaints about the reclining seats in
vehicles not included in the recall, including reports of 14
crashes and 10 injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reports clearly indicate a similar type of failure of the
seat back recliner as that in the recall population,'' said a NHTSA
report on the investigation. The report notes that the complaint
rate on the vehicles that were not recalled, 81.69 per 100,000, is
similar to those that were, 79.31 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors spokesman Greg Martin said the company has no
plans to expand the recall but is cooperating with NHTSA's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right at this time, we're cooperating with NHTSA's request to
look at the matter further,'' he said. ''We've seen very few
complaints for the expanded population.''
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA opens safety investigations with a preliminary inquiry in
which the government and manufacturer exchange paperwork that
includes any complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation then could be upgraded to an ''engineering
analysis,'' during which engineers study parts for defects. That is
the stage of the Saturn investigation.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation eventually can lead to a recall or an expanded
recall, but many are dropped.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA closed one investigation last month that led to a recall.
DaimlerChrysler Corp. recalled 154,393 Dakotas from model years
1991-1992 with A-5000 transmissions, because they can suddenly roll
in reverse when they are parked.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA was investigating 95 crashes connected to the problem,
which caused five fatalities and 28 injuries, but the agency closed
the case on Aug. 10 because of the recall.
</P>
<P>
   In other action last month, NHTSA upgraded its investigation
into 1996-2000 model years of the Volkswagen A4. There have been 71
complaints that the brakes do not work as well in wet conditions as
in dry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several complainants described the problem as a total or near
total loss of braking capability for several seconds after applying
the brakes,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries or deaths have been reported, but one person told
NHTSA that the problem caused an accident.
</P>
<P>
   There are 112,000 of the vehicles on the road.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA also upgraded an investigation into 1996 Volkswagen
Passats and Jettas that may have lights and windshield wiper
failure that can lead to obscured vision and increase the risk of a
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen people have complained about the problem. There are
19,356 Passats and 88,992 Jettas that may be affected.

<HEADLINE> Date For Federal Execution Set  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE STRAWLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- An inmate sentenced to death for
strangling his cellmate has dropped all appeals, making him likely
to become the first person to be executed by the federal government
since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   David Paul Hammer, 41, a con man so violent that Oklahoma built
him a special isolation cell with steel doors and shatterproof
glass, is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The date was set by a federal judge in Williamsport, Pa., on
Thursday after a judicial panel granted his request to drop an
appeal of his death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer, who is on federal death row in Terre Haute, Ind., where
the execution would take place, is representing himself. His
court-appointed lawyer, Ronald C. Travis, is barred from taking
action.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only is he riding on the train, he is the engineer,''
Travis said.
</P>
<P>
   A prisoner since age 19, Hammer killed Andrew Marti in 1996 by
tying him to his bunk and strangling him with a braided bedsheet at
the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Before the killing, Hammer had built a reputation as one of
Oklahoma's most troublesome prisoners. He was sentenced to more
than 1,200 years for a spree of kidnapping and attempted murder
that followed his escape from prison in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   His misdeeds while in state prison included credit-card scams
and a telephone bomb threat that shut down the Oklahoma Capitol. He
once used a prison employee's credit card to send flowers to the
warden.
</P>
<P>
   Travis said the incidents were part of a scheme to get him
transferred, and he eventually got his wish, landing in the federal
penal system.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty in 1998 to killing his cellmate. He initially
refused to challenge an execution scheduled for January 1999, then
changed his mind and allowed an appeal. He changed his mind again
and asked to be executed as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton can intervene in the execution without being
asked, Travis said. In July, Clinton, a death penalty supporter,
postponed the execution of another federal inmate, Juan Raul Garza.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people have been executed by states since the
Supreme Court lifted a moratorium on the death penalty in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The last execution carried out by the federal government was 37
years ago, when Victor Feguer was hanged in Iowa for kidnapping and
killing a doctor.

<HEADLINE> Pataki vetoes bill giving tax exemption to first-time homeowners  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki vetoed a bill Friday that
would have given first-time buyers a tax break on newly built
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki cited ''serious technical deficiencies,'' including the
definitions of a first-time buyer and eligibility standards for the
tax exemption.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation called for a 50 percent tax exemption in the
first year that would decline by 10 percent annually over five
years to a 10 percent exemption in the final year. It would have
applied to new homes and existing properties with higher assessed
values after renovations costing more than $3,000 contracted within
three months of the date of purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said eligibility requirements were not clearly explained
in the legislation. A home buyer's income and the sale price were
both listed as determining factors, but the qualification standards
are dependent on things like house type and household sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The language (of the bill) creates the distinct misimpression
that there will be a single income ceiling and a single purchase
price ceiling for each county,'' Pataki wrote in his veto message.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also defined a first-time home buyer as someone who
hasn't owned a home during the previous three years and who doesn't
own a vacation or investment home. Pataki said the definition has a
''significant loophole'' because it doesn't cover a buyer's spouse,
as specified in other state and federal mortgage programs.
</P>
<P>
   If an owner vacates the home within five years, it would be
difficult to recoup the exemption, Pataki added. While the bill
calls for a lien against a property if the amount due is not paid,
such liens wouldn't be applied until after the property is vacated.
Pataki said by then it may be difficult to enforce the liens since
the property may have changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   In other bills dealt with Friday by the governor:
</P>
<P>
   -Pataki signed into law legislation expanding programs aimed at
reducing energy costs for eligible commercial and industrial firms
in New York City. Manufacturers that qualify for discounts on
energy costs under the existing Energy Cost Savings Program or the
Lower Manhattan Energy Program will be exempted from the city sales
tax on electricity and gas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, energy rebates under the two programs will now be
calculated based on the transmission or distribution of energy as
the city and the rest of the state undergo utility deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   -Pataki vetoed a bill that would have increased penalties to
commercial vehicles weighing less than 26,000 pounds that illegally
travel on parkways and restricted highways. The measure would have
increased the fine for a first violation from $100 to $250; a
second violation within 18 months from $200 to $500; and a third
violation within 18 months from $300 to $750.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the bill did not address penalties for trucks
weighing more than 26,000 pounds, which would end up paying lower
fines than smaller trucks.
</P>
<P>
   -Pataki signed into law a bill raising from $500 to $1,000 the
New York State Blind Annuity for visually impaired veterans and
surviving spouses who have not remarried.
</P>
<P>
   -Pataki approved legislation making children of Vietnam veterans
born with Spina Bifida eligible for a $450-a-year college grant
under the Child of a Veteran Regents Award. Spina Bifida is a birth
defect linked to Agent Orange, a chemical used widely during the
Vietnam War. It is estimated as many as 3,000 children of Vietnam
veterans nationwide have been born with the abnormality.
</P>
<P>
   -The governor approved legislation ceremonially designating a
section of Interstate Route 84 from the Newburgh-Beacon bridge to
Port Jervis as the ''Orange County Purple Heart Highway'' to honor
veterans.

<HEADLINE> Pataki hitting road to boost Bush  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki said Friday he will set
off next week on a five-day, five-state campaign trip next week in
an attempt to boost the electoral fortunes of Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush has requested it in certain key states,'' the New York
Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki will start on Sunday with an afternoon speech in
Manchester, N.H., at that state's Republican convention before
flying to Florida for campaign stops with Rep. Bill McCollum, the
GOP's candidate for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by fellow
Republican Connie Mack.
</P>
<P>
   During President Clinton's impeachment, McCollum was the House
floor manager.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Pataki will be joined by former U.S. Rep. Susan
Molinari, R-NY, and Elaine Chau, the former chairwoman of the
United Way of America, to campaign across Florida, including stops
in Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach, Miami and at a Jewish community
center in Aventura, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has become a battleground state in the presidential race
since Democrat Al Gore selected Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his
runningmate. The Connecticut Democrat is the first Jew to run on a
major party national ticket. Florida has a large Jewish population,
many of them retirees from New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Florida, there's no question there are a lot of
transplanted New Yorkers who look at New York state and see it's
dramatically changed for the better and appreciate those changes,''
said Pataki, who has cut taxes and restored the death penalty in
New York, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   After a one-day break, Pataki will head to Washington state on
Wednesday where he will hold a town hall meeting in Seattle and
make other campaign stops. On Thursday, the New York governor makes
campaign stops in Portland and Eugene, Ore., before heading for
Sacramento, Calif. On Friday, Pataki plans to campaign in southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he felt it was important to have a fellow governor
in the White House so states ''aren't dictated to from
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a close race and I think it'll be a close race right down
to the end,'' the New York governor added.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki brushed aside a question about whether the tour might
serve to boost his own national standing in preparation for a
presidential run if Bush loses in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the Bush campaign asking me to do this,'' Pataki said.

	   RYE BROOK, N.Y. (AP) - Judith Hope was elected to another
two-year term as state Democratic Party chairwoman on Friday during
a state committee meeting in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Hope, who took office in 1995 in the wake of Gov. Mario Cuomo's
loss to Republican George Pataki, has been a major booster of the
first lady's Senate campaign and is credited with helping rebuild

<HEADLINE> DPUC approves NU-ConEd merger  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   Connecticut utility regulators Friday gave preliminary approval
to the $7.5 billion merger of Northeast Utilities and Consolidated
Edison Inc., but required the companies to offer a smorgasbord of
savings for customers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates, however, said the draft decision was about
as tasty as rubber chicken, and both companies found the proposals
were unpalatable.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Public Utility Control said the merger could
go forward so long as NU subsidiaries cut rates and shared high
profits with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   NU's Connecticut Light &AMP; Power division must reduce distribution
rates by 3 percent until the end of 2003, the DPUC said. The
company's rates for electricity, which are subject to competition,
already are frozen until that time.
</P>
<P>
   NU's Yankee Gas division must reduce costs for average customers
by more than 5 percent for a year, the DPUC said.
</P>
<P>
   Since savings may be even greater from the merger, regulators
said they would review both utilities' rates before these mandated
cuts expire.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conditions are designed to ensure that Connecticut's
ratepayers reap benefits from the acquisition, while protecting the
state's economy and its environment,'' the DPUC said.
</P>
<P>
   NU, based in Berlin, said it was disappointed in the draft
decision and said the proposed conditions were unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   ''Left unchanged, this decision makes a successful merger
difficult, if not impossible, to achieve,'' NU said in a news
release.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based ConEd said some of the consumer provisions could
prevent them from achieving goals to improve infrastructure and
enhance reliability.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have some concerns with some of the conditions, so we're
saying we need several days to study it,'' spokesman Michael
Clendenin said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates said the draft decision was unacceptable
because it did not offer enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the benefits - very modest rate reductions, meager
sharings of savings with ratepayers, a moratorium of layoffs - last
only until 2003. They are a short-term fix for an irreversible bad
marriage,'' said Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The merger savings that are being shared is just a drop in the
bucket. The reduction of stranded costs is unduly minimal,'' said
Consumer Counsel Guy Mazza.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may have felt differently. Both companies' stocks were
up in trading Friday.
</P>
<P>
   All parties have until Sept. 29 to submit written comments. The
DPUC then will hold more hearings. The agency plans to issue a
final decision Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would create the country's largest electricity and
gas utility, with more than 6.5 million customers in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In applying for the merger, NU and ConEd promised to extend
CL&AMP;P's current rate freeze for two years, through 2005. They also
offered to share high profits with consumers and give a $50 million
break off of ''stranded costs'' - old CL&AMP;P debts that consumers are
required to pay under Connecticut's electric deregulation law.
</P>
<P>
   The DPUC went further than that: CL&AMP;P must cut 3 percent off
distribution rates, Yankee Gas must reduce revenues by $13 million
and CL&AMP;P must forgive consumers $60 million off its old debts.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators also increased the company's profit-sharing offer.
</P>
<P>
   The company proposed refunding 40 percent of any CL&AMP;P profits
above 12.3 percent of net revenues, plus $50 million, for 10 years
after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Under state regulations, CL&AMP;P can only earn up to a 10.3 percent
profit off its net revenues. The DPUC investigates if earnings come
in at 11.3 percent or higher for six months, and it could order the
company to refund excess profits to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The DPUC said any earnings above 11.3 percent for CL&AMP;P or 11.15
percent for Yankee Gas should be split 50-50 with ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   Mazza said this decision means that the company could keep more
excess profits than it would be allowed to do otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ConEd is paying $1.5 billion more than NU's book value to
acquire the company. The DPUC said this premium cannot be reflected
in rates, but Mazza and other consumer advocates wanted the premium
to offset stranded costs that consumers must pay.
</P>
<P>
   The companies promised to add 600 jobs in Connecticut and keep
CL&AMP;P's headquarters in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The DPUC mandated that no layoffs are allowed for two years
after the merger. After that, any Connecticut worker who is let go
must be allowed to apply for vacant jobs at ConEd.
</P>
<P>
   The agency agreed that headquarters for CL&AMP;P and Yankee Gas must
stay in Connecticut, along with service headquarters for New
England operations. ConEd's gas control center must be moved to the
state, the decision said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the deal have questioned ConEd's ability to provide
reliable electric service, following several high-profile power
outages in New York.
</P>
<P>
   They also questioned ConEd's track record on the environment and
with running nuclear power plants, and they opposed the estimated
$30 million in stock options and bonuses top executives would get
under the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, ConEd will buy NU's common stock for $25
per share in a combination of cash and ConEd common stock.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $1 per share will be paid if NU reaches a
definitive agreement to sell the Millstone 2 and 3 nuclear power
plants by the end of the year. Dominion Resources of Virginia has
said it would buy the plants for $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Besides CL&AMP;P, the merger includes NU's regulated subsidiaries
Western Massachusetts Electric Co., Public Service Company of New
Hampshire and Yankee Energy Systems, a natural gas distributor.
</P>
<P>
   ConEd operates Consolidated Edison Company of New York, an
electric, gas and steam utility that serves New York City and its
suburbs. The company also owns Orange &AMP; Rockland Utilities Inc.,
which serves customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Other assets include Con Edison Solutions and Select Energy, an
unregulated power supplier that serves New York, Rhode Island and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The deal still needs approval from regulators in New Hampshire
and New York, and from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders from both companies, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission have approved
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in Maine, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and
Vermont also approved the merger or said they would take no action
on the plan.

<HEADLINE> Camden Council rejects state's choice of business administrator  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - In action rendered moot by the state, City
Council on Friday voted not to support the state's choice for city
business administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Council voted 6-1 to reject the appointment of Norton N.
Bonaparte Jr. Instead, the council supported Heriberto Colon, who
has been acting business administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Milton Milan, in a show of defiance against the state,
named Colon to the post Sept. 12, saying he, not the state, has the
power to hire and fire employees.
</P>
<P>
   The state Division of Local Government Services since May has
been overseeing finances in the state's poorest city. Jane M.
Kenny, commissioner of the state Department of Community Affairs,
said the council's action is moot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Bonaparte's name was placed before the council as a
gesture of good faith and cooperation,'' she said, adding the
authority to make the appointment rests with the director of Local
Government Services, Ulrich Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg on Friday affirmed Bonaparte's appointment. Bonaparte,
who has been city manager in Willingboro since 1995, is scheduled
to begin his new job on Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Council President Gwendolyn Faison was the lone vote in support
of Bonaparte.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders contend that the state is disenfranchising city
voters by making hiring decisions. Councilman Israel Nieves called
the state's appointment of Bonaparte a ''blatant, illegal act to
usurp the prerogative of the residents of Camden.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny said it is actually City Council that is doing the
residents a disservice.
</P>
<P>
   ''By rejecting the far more qualified person for the job, the
City Council again has put politics ahead of good government,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the council insists on making political statements, the
city's finances and operations continue to deteriorate,'' Kenny
said. ''The council had an opportunity to support a dynamic
individual with the background, credentials and administrative
experience to help lead the city forward. Instead, the council
voted to turn its back on the people and abandon its responsibility
to make constructive decisions on the city's behalf.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Says No Basis To Probe Gore  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno said Friday that
Justice Department investigators found no basis for investigating
Vice President Al Gore's relationship to donations from trial
lawyers interested in a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is not'' a preliminary investigation of the matter
underway by the campaign finance task force, Reno told her weekly
news conference, denying a published report that one had begun.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue came up,'' she said. ''They looked at it and didn't
see a basis for proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Justice official, requesting anonymity, said there was
one discussion of the matter recently.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was asked to make calls in 1995 by a Democratic National
Committee official after a dinner in Texas with trial lawyers at a
time when the Republican-controlled Congress passed legislation
limiting awards in lawsuits. Clinton later vetoed the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets describing the calls to be made had been in the task
force's possession for several years since it looked into Gore's
telephone solicitations, which Reno concluded in 1998 provided no
basis for naming an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, it was noticed that at least one call sheet made
reference to the veto. But the senior Justice official said the
sheets reflected efforts to obtain money from contributors who
supported the same position as the administration, which is not
illegal. The call sheets contained no indication that anyone said
the veto would not be issued unless a contribution was made, which
is illegal, this official said.
</P>
<P>
   In the four years since Gore was asked to make the fund-raising
phone call to Texas trial lawyer Walter Umphrey, the attorney and
his firm, involved in tobacco industry litigation, have contributed
$790,000 to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Gore said the vice president never made the call to
Umphrey.
</P>
<P>
   A call sheet prepared two weeks later for Democratic National
Chairman Donald Fowler suggested Democratic officials were
concerned that Umphrey wouldn't begin writing six-figure checks
until after Clinton vetoed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The call sheet to Fowler suggested language he could use in a
call to the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sorry you missed the vice president,'' stated the call sheet.
''I know will give $100K whn the president vetos tort reform, but
we really need it now. Please send ASAP if possible.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Park Police sound alarm over staffing shortages  </HEADLINE>
By CANDACE E. SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Already understaffed, United States Park
Police and rangers fear their numbers will continue to dwindle
unless they get a bigger budget.
</P>
<P>
   The union representing park police began an information campaign
Friday, urging people in Washington, D.C., New York and San
Francisco to contact members of Congress to push their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Citing two reports, union officials said continued staffing
shortages are putting national parks and monuments and their more
than 280 million annual visitors at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The reports - one commissioned by the National Park Service and
the other by Congress - warn that terrorists could easily destroy
national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   The report to Congress, titled ''Law Enforcement Programs Study,
United States Park Police,'' states that unless the enforcement
agencies have proper funding to hire more staff, there could be
more crime and less public safety on park land.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to say that at this point we're at a critical
phase, but we're fast approaching,'' said Peter Ward, chairman of
the Fraternal Order of Police for the U.S. Park Police.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're about 150 officers short, and we're hearing that we're
only going to be hiring another 24 officers next year,'' said Ward.
''We could be as much as 250 officers short by the end of next
year,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The reports recommend park police numbers be increased from 650
to more than 800. The congressional report recommends hiring more
than 1,200 rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of our officers are leaving, the younger ones, because
of low pay and that's the reason they're giving when they resign
and go to other agencies,'' said Ward. He noted that officers with
the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department earn 10
percent more than park police, where the average starting salary is
just over $31,000.
</P>
<P>
   A bill before Congress would increase the pay for park police
and the uniformed Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''With competitive salaries and benefits, these two agencies
will be able to more effectively recruit and retain officers,''
said one of the bill's sponsors, Rep. Connie Morella, R-Md.
</P>
<P>
   To rally public support, Ward said a truck with a banner calling
for the protection of national parks will be driven around the
National Mall everyday until Congress goes into recess. He also
said flyers will be handed out in all three cities.
</P>
<P>
   The unions representing the park police and rangers note their
members also need training, new vehicles, upgrades to computers and
radio systems and better security and surveillance systems. But
Ward said the staffing shortages are the most critical issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We prefer to address the problem...before something terrible
does happen.''

<HEADLINE> Taliban Seizes Towns on Border  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR SHAH
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- The ruling Taliban claimed Friday they
had captured four towns on Afghanistan's northern frontier from
opposition forces and severed a key supply route from neighboring
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban have scored a string of triumphs in the region this
month, pushing the opposition deeper into an isolated corner of
northeast Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In fighting Thursday night and early Friday, the Taliban said
they captured the towns of Dasht-e-Archi and Imam Sahib, and then
took the border posts of Sher Khan and Highi Kannon.All are located
about 185 miles north of the capital Kabul on or near the Pyandzh
River, which marks the border with Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban also claimed to have seized one of the opposition's
key supply routes from Tajikistan. The opposition desperately needs
to keep open supply lines to Tajikistan, but the Taliban have been
advancing steadily north and east, pushing to the Tajik border in
several areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban's Radio Shariat said opposition resistance was
weakening and that Taliban fighters were seizing large ammunition
stocks left behind by their foes.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition spokesman Mohammed Abil acknowledged the loss of
Dasht-e-Archi but said opposition forces were still defending other
outposts in the region.
</P>
<P>
   There was no civilian exodus from the towns captured Friday,
Radio Shariat said, adding that many welcomed the Taliban fighters
as they entered.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of civilians have fled their homes this month
as the Taliban have taken the northern towns, and there are fears
that large numbers will try to cross into neighboring Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   However, most of the fleeing civilians have so far stayed close
to their hometowns, and some have returned after the fighting has
ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, who practice a harsh brand of Islamic law, now
control more than 90 percent of Afghanistan. The opposition, led by
Burhanuddin Rabbani, the former president who was ousted in 1996,
is made up of ethnic Tajiks and other minorities.

<HEADLINE> Videotapes Sought on French Leader  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA VON DERSCHAU
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Two investigators on Friday searched the offices of
a video production company that made a tape allegedly implicating
President Jacques Chirac in a campaign finance incident 14 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators, accompanied by police officers, went to
Sunset Presse, whose director, Arnaud Hamelin, made the video in
which a former member of Chirac's Rally for the Republic party,
reportedly describes handing over cash in Chirac's presence.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague of Hamelin, who refused to be named, said that
investigators seized the tape after a four-hour search.
</P>
<P>
   The Le Monde daily newspaper on Thursday published what it
claimed was the transcript of the video interview that Hamelin
conducted with Jean-Claude Mery, a property developer and one-time
member of the central committee of Chirac's party.
</P>
<P>
   In the transcript, Mery -- who was investigated for illegal party
funding in the 1980s and 1990s -- describes handing over $649,000 in
cash in 1986 to an official from the Rally for the Republic party
in the presence of Chirac, then the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac denied the Le Monde report Thursday, calling the
allegations ''outrageous'' and ''lies.'' Chirac did not comment on
further allegations in Friday's Le Monde in which Mery was quoted
as saying he worked only on Chirac's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Mery died in 1999, and the transcript was made available to Le
Monde, with his earlier agreement, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Le Monde quoted Mery as saying he collected between $4.5 million
and $5.2 million for political parties, including the Rally for the
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac is unlikely to become the target of an investigation
soon. Last year, the constitutional court ruled that Chirac can't
face criminal charges as long as he is president.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative politicians on Friday defended Chirac, with the
current Mayor Jean Tiberi calling the allegations ''lies.''

<HEADLINE> Building Named for Harry Truman  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department's block-square downtown
headquarters was named Friday for Democrat Harry S. Truman, whose
forthright presidency shaped the history of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In presiding over the unveiling of Truman's name in silver gilt
on a block of black granite, President Clinton quoted a 1946
editorial in which the London Daily Telegraph called Truman ''the
living, kicking symbol of what everyone likes about America.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a pretty good reason for putting his name on the State
Department,'' Clinton said in a sun-spangled ceremony in which the
Navy Band played the big-band music of the Truman era.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said the newspaper's tribute ''really doesn't even
get into the top 10.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For history will credit Harry Truman for creating the
architecture of postwar internationalism in politics and economics;
for drawing the line against communism and for democracy, setting
us squarely on the trail of freedom we continue to blaze today,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The naming of the State Department building for the 33rd
president, a proud, vocal and successful Democrat, comes after a
spate of congressionally ordered namings of Washington landmarks
for Republican heroes.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months a new and major federal office building and
National Airport have been named for Ronald Reagan, the Executive
Office Building neighboring the White House was named for President
Dwight D. Eisenhower and CIA headquarters at Langley, Va. was named
for former President George Bush, a former CIA director.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's one for us,'' presidential press secretary Joe Lockhart
said last week when he talked about naming the State Department
building for Truman.
</P>
<P>
   At the ceremony, Truman's grand nephew, John Ross Truman,
represented the Truman family. He said that when he was growing up
in Missouri he knew the president of the United States simply as
''Uncle Harry.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he would have been very proud and humbled by the step
you are taking today to immortalize his good name,'' John Truman
said. ''To me and to my family Uncle Harry was the honest, plain
spoken embodiment of Uncle Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Truman Daniel, Truman's daughter and biographer, was
not present for the ceremony. Her son, William Wallace Daniel, died
earlier this month of injuries suffered when he was struck by a
car. Her husband, former New York Times managing editor Clifton
Daniel, died in February. ''We're thinking about her in what has
been a hard year,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John ''Ike'' Skelton, D-Mo., who introduced the legislation
naming the State Department building, regretted that in a city full
of memorials none honored Truman.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who came to the United
States with her family from Czechoslovakia in 1946, said Truman was
special to her because ''Harry S. Truman was my first American
president.''
</P>
<P>
   ''His brave words and actions mended a broken world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Truman himself spoke, in words inked on the printed program
passed out to the crowd of several hundred diplomats and civil
servants who filled the street in front of the State department.
</P>
<P>
   ''The foreign policy of the United States is based firmly on
fundamental principles of righteousness and justice,'' he said in
October 1945, just months after assuming the presidency. ''In
carrying out those principles we shall firmly adhere to what we
believe to be right; and we hall no give our approval to any
compromise with evil,'' he said.''
</P>
<P>
   ''President Truman understood the importance, not just of
winning the war, but of building the institutions and alliances
that could maintain the peace,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a job he did,'' he said, citing the United Nations, NATO,
the Truman Doctrine, the Berlin Airlift, Korea and the Marshall
Plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great day and this is a good thing,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we should do more than dedicate this building to Harry
Truman,'' he said. ''We should rededicate ourselves today to
fulfilling his vision in the new century.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 82; Nasdaq Drops 25  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks staged a notable recovery Friday after
being dragged down most of the day in the wake of another profit
warning by a bellwether company -- this time chipmaker Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain hunters moved in about midday, helping the Dow Jones
industrial average close up 81.85 at 10,847.37, after the blue-chip
index had dropped more than 140 points early in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also closed lower, but well above their
lows for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index finished down 25.11 at 3,803.76,
regaining nearly all of the losses that saw the technology focused
index fall 214 points in midmorning. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index closed down 0.33 at 1,448.72.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got a reprieve from the hangman today. Things looked a
little bleak this morning,'' said Al Kugel, senior investment
strategist at Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   News that the seven largest industrial nations had stepped in to
help buoy the ailing euro currency, as well as strong speculation
throughout the day that the Clinton administration planned to dip
into the nation's oil reserves to ease rising energy prices -- a
speculation eventually borne out -- helped offset the near panic
caused by Intel's profit warning.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Gallagher, head of U.S. equity trading at CIBC World
Markets, said investors have been concerned primarily with three
issues in recent weeks -- earnings, the decline in value of the
euro, and rising energy prices. The ''Big Three,'' he called them.
</P>
<P>
   All three are intertwined in the global marketplace, Gallagher
noted, citing the Intel warning as a textbook example of how each
condition affects the other.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, with Europe's single currency hovering around
all-time lows, large, multinational corporations are feeling the
pinch in their European operations.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the world's largest chipmaker announced after the close
of Thursday's trading session that it expects third-quarter
revenues to fall below expectations. The company specifically
blamed a falloff in demand in Europe for the weaker results.
</P>
<P>
   The news prompted analysts at half a dozen investment banks to
lower their ratings on Intel's stock Friday, further fueling the
atmosphere of panic among investors in one of Wall Street's most
widely held stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Intel traded hands at breakneck speed on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. Volume reached 304 million, shattering the all-time
daily Nasdaq volume record of 172 million shares set by Oracle
Corp. in December 1997. Intel's average daily volume is 38 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got this shocker from Intel, which is probably the leading
tech game in town, and that really frightened people into thinking
that perhaps some of the valuations in the tech area might be too
high,'' said Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's shares closed down $13.55, or 22 percent, to $47.94.
</P>
<P>
   Technology investors began fleeing the market in after-hours
trading Thursday evening, and that exodus expanded in scope at
Friday's opening.
</P>
<P>
   Intel led the way, but other widely held technology stocks also
felt investors' wrath. Dell Computer dropped $2 to $35.94 and
Applied Materials fell $3.50 to $70.
</P>
<P>
   With third-quarter earnings season just a few weeks away and
increasing signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, investors have
been punishing stocks whose companies fail to meet their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Strength in a handful of blue-chip sectors, including utilities
and drugs, helped staunch the selling momentum that threatened to
overwhelm the markets early in the session.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities sector, which has served as a haven for frightened
investors all year, was led by Duke Energy, up $1.25 at $75.88.
Pharmacia Corp., up $3 to $59, helped lift the drug sector.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume to 1.4 billion shares,
well ahead of Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 4.47 to 518.82.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 3.02 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 0.86 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose
0.11 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.06 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Pay in Ruby Ridge Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government paid $380,000 Friday to
Kevin Harris, who alleged his rights were violated when an FBI
sniper wounded him during the 1992 Ruby Ridge siege.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department announced the settlement of the last
remaining civil lawsuit arising from the weeklong standoff at the
Idaho compound of white separatist Randy Weaver. The government did
not admit any liability as it paid Harris to drop his $10 million
civil damage suit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the government paid Weaver and his three surviving
children $3.1 million in the killing of Weaver's wife, Vicki, and
son, Samuel.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court
ruling that dismissed state criminal charges against the FBI
sniper, Lon Horiuchi. The same shot by Horiuchi, a member of the
bureau's hostage rescue team, killed Vicki Weaver and wounded
Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General David Ogden said Friday, ''This
settlement resolves this long pending case in a way that is fair to
the United States and all involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ruby Ridge siege, which lead to new rules governing when FBI
agents can fire their guns, had its origins in 1991. That year,
Weaver, who had been charged with firearms-related offenses, was
indicted for failure to appeal at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Weaver's case was referred to the U.S. Marshals, who
sought to persuade him to surrender. Instead of surrendering,
Weaver remained on his remote, wooded property along with his wife
and children, and their friend, Harris.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, 1992, while U.S. Marshals were watching the Weaver
property, an exchange of gunfire broke out and resulted in the
deaths of Deputy Marshal William Degan and Weaver's son, Samuel.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Weaver and Harris were later acquitted of federal charges
of killing Degan.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of the standoff, the FBI hostage rescue team
arrived. Horiuchi fired at Harris, who was armed, as Harris
retreated toward the cabin. The bullet passed through the curtained
window of the cabin door, killed Vicki Weaver, who was standing
behind the door holding an infant, and wounded Harris.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department investigated a handful of top FBI
officials for allegedly covering up their role in the siege and
shootings, particularly in drawing up the rules of engagement for
the snipers. One former FBI supervisor, E. Michael Kahoe, pleaded
guilty to obstruction of justice for destroying an internal FBI
post-confrontation critique.
</P>
<P>
   Of the handful who were suspended during the probe, only Kahoe
was charged with a crime. But Deputy Director Larry Potts was
demoted, and he and a top aide of his, Danny Coulson, both left the
government before decisions were reached on whether to impose
administrative discipline.

<HEADLINE> IRS: Fraud in Tax Program for Poor  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A tax program for the working poor that
Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore wants to sharply expand
lost $7.8 billion because of fraud and errors in 1997 -- one-quarter
of the claims made that year, the Treasury Department reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the earned income tax
credit has played ''a vital role'' in lifting millions of people
out of poverty but acknowledged that steps need to be taken to
reduce the error rate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is critical that we take steps to preserve the integrity of
the EITC and better ensure that only eligible families are
receiving the credit,'' Summers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Internal Revenue Service comes as Gore is
proposing a 10-year, $29 billion plan to expand the credit so that
6.8 million more working families would qualify, according to Gore
campaign documents. President Clinton also proposed expanding the
credit in this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on Capitol Hill called the errors unacceptable and
said it should raise a red flag about any proposal to expand it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's absolutely no reason why the EITC should be expanded
until this terribly costly problem is fixed,'' said Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
''This is exactly, and unfortunately, what happens when politicians
use the tax code as a mechanism for massive social spending
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway said the report did raise
concern about how the EITC is run but added it would not deter the
vice president from pushing his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore thinks expanding it is the right thing to do,''
Hattaway said. ''We need to see that everyone enjoys the prosperity
we have. We all obviously want to see that it's administered
correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   The EITC, created by Congress in 1975 with strong bipartisan
support, applies to working people with incomes below $30,580,
depending on number of children. It is refundable, meaning that
even if a taxpayer owed no income tax they can get a government
check by claiming the credit -- about 86 percent of claims represent
this form of direct cash assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The credit is difficult to figure out and has always been
plagued by errors. In 1997, the IRS found that 25.6 percent of more
than $30 billion in claims ''should not have been paid'' due to
mistakes or fraud. About 20 million taxpayers made EITC claims that
year.
</P>
<P>
   The most common errors:
</P>
<P>
   --22 percent of the money paid, over $2 billion, went to
taxpayers who claimed children that don't qualify. Most often, this
happened because the child didn't live with the taxpayer for at
least six months.
</P>
<P>
   --17 percent of claims, representing $1.6 billion, involved
children who lived with more than one adult -- and the second adult
made too much money to be eligible for the EITC.
</P>
<P>
   --14 percent, or $1.3 billion, stemmed from income reporting
errors.
</P>
<P>
   --10.5 percent, involving $974 million, claimed single status
when they shouldn't have.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS noted that several measures passed by Congress to
improve compliance were not fully in effect in 1997, including new
penalties, more money to check returns and better access to
government data about a child's parents and where they live.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, however, said the IRS needed to take additional steps
this year, including new warning notices to taxpayers who don't
appear to be eligible based on past claims, better efforts to
educate paid preparers in how to figure the EITC and greater
authority to deny claims in certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is also asking Congress for several
changes in the law, including giving the IRS authority to deny
claims made by certain taxpayers before the actual payments are
made.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Ambassador Pays Settlement  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former U.S. ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith paid
$5,000 Friday to settle conflict-of-interest allegations arising
from a donation she solicited for an Irish festival at the Kennedy
Center here.
</P>
<P>
   The civil settlement, released by the Justice Department, said
there was never any allegation that Smith, sister of slain
President John F. Kennedy, gained personally from the $1 million
gift from Ireland. It was made to finance an Irish Festival at the
John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was a trustee of the nonprofit cultural and charitable
center at the time. She was also the U.S. ambassador to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Federal criminal law bars any executive branch employee,
including ambassadors, from knowingly participating personally and
substantially in any particular matter in which an organization has
a financial interest if the employee is a trustee of that
organization.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the settlement document said, when Smith began her
more than five years' service as ambassador to Ireland in 1993, she
wrote a letter to the State Department legal advisor and ethics
officer stating that she would not personally solicit any funds
involving the Kennedy Center.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she admitted in the settlement that on Aug. 5,
1998, she sent a letter on official State Department stationery to
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern requesting the $1 million
donation from the Irish government to help underwrite the costs of
the year 2000 Irish Festival sponsored by and held at the Kennedy
Center.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement, Smith said, ''I understood I had
approval'' to write the letter. ''As ambassador one of my important
responsibilities was to promote and foster cultural exchanges
between the two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   She emphasized that she has no financial interest in the Kennedy
Center and that ''the gift of the Irish government went entirely to
help meet the costs of the Festival; none of it went to the Kennedy
Center's endowment. In short, I believe there was absolutely no
conflict of interest on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith denied in the settlement that she violated federal law.
The document said she and government officials agreed to the civil
settlement ''to avoid the expense, delay and uncertainty of
litigation.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Fires-Logging Link Tenuous  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional researchers who last month found
little or no relationship between this summer's massive wildfires
and the decline in timber harvests now say the possibility of a
link ''cannot be determined from the available data.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Research Service report was released Friday
after two Republicans who oversee the service's budget asked for a
review of the earlier report, which was criticized by logging
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The revised report ''is clearly a retraction of the first
analysis,'' said Doug Crandall, chief of staff for the House
Resources forests and forest health subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Helen Chenoweth-Hage, R-Idaho
-- a frequent critic of Forest Service logging reductions -- released
the new report.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he requested the original report to
try to stem the political rhetoric over who is to blame for the
worst wildfire season in the West in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously there's a lot of spin and reverse spin being applied
to the forest fire story during election time, but Senator Wyden
hopes ... both parties will look for common ground,'' said Josh
Kardon, Wyden's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfires that have burned 6.8 million acres this year have
sparked a debate among lawmakers about whether a 77 percent drop in
logging in federal forests from 1987 to 1999 caused a buildup of
timber that contributed to the severity of the fire season.
</P>
<P>
   The research service, a bipartisan arm of the Library of
Congress, examined Forest Service timber harvests and acres burned
on agency land from 1980 through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Data showed that two of the four worst fire years -- 1987 and
1988 -- occurred during the peak timber harvests of the last 20
years and that the other two worst fire years, 1994 and 1996,
occurred during low timber harvest years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The acres burned in any particular year appear to be at most
weakly related to the volume of timber harvested,'' the analysis in
the earlier report said.
</P>
<P>
   Crandall said hundreds of Forest Service employees and
scientists complained to him about the report, calling the analysis
simplistic and misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, and Rep. Charles Taylor, R-N.C.,
who chair the Senate and House appropriations subcommittees that
approve the service's budget, were concerned about the lack of
science in the report and asked the service to clarify the initial
finding, according to spokespersons for both lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The revised report said, ''The extent to which timber harvesting
from the national forests in any particular year, or even over
several years, affects fire extent and/or severity in a given year
cannot be determined from the available data.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross W. Gorte, the research service analyst who wrote the
reports, said he already was working on a more expansive follow-up
when the lawmakers made their request for the second report.
</P>
<P>
   Gorte said he doesn't believe the revised report reached a
different conclusion than the first one but presents a ''broader
context of the situation.''

<HEADLINE> FTC: Unapproved HIV Tests Exported  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government crackdown on unapproved AIDS
tests sold to Americans over the Internet has uncovered another
complaint: Such tests routinely are exported to other countries
with no guarantee they work, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission this week announced its fourth
legal action against unapproved HIV tests, a small settlement
forbidding a California distributor from misleading advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory agency also complained about exports of the very
HIV tests it seeks to keep from Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Defective test kits may contribute to the spread of AIDS,''
FTC Commissioner Orson Swindle said in a statement accompanying the
latest settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A law governing the Food and Drug Administration permits export
of such products ''without regard to their accuracy,'' Swindle
wrote in a complaint echoed by a second FTC commissioner. ''The
gravity of this disease and its devastating impact on the world's
population warrant a hard look at whether current export laws and
practices adequately address the export of devices that, if faulty,
may contribute to the spread of AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 law permits medical devices not approved for U.S. sale to
be exported to countries that have FDA-style health regulators,
assuming those nations can adequately protect their own citizens.
Once overseas, the products can be reshipped to developing nations.
Countries must understand the products are not FDA-approved, and
companies must meet certain manufacturing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA and FTC last summer began a crackdown on HIV tests sold
illegally here.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC has discovered faulty tests made or distributed by three
companies, and went to court to successfully stop their sales here
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has received ''a small number'' of complaints from other
countries about exported HIV tests and ''there are a number of
investigations going on,'' compliance chief Steven Masiello said
Friday. He could not elaborate on ongoing probes.
</P>
<P>
   How many unapproved HIV tests are exported? Masiello said he
didn't know. But the agency has cited 11 makers or distributors of
unapproved HIV tests between 1997 and July for illegal exports.
Most didn't follow conditions in that 1996 export law, such as
having quality manufacturing facilities. Some were allowed to
resume exporting once they fixed such problems; the FDA did not
evaluate the HIV tests' accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's complaint came Thursday as it announced a settlement
with Sovo Tec Diagnostics of Novato, Calif., forbidding misleading
advertising. Sovo Tec, which brokers overseas sales of the
products, had promoted unapproved HIV tests as ''the most accurate
technology available.''
</P>
<P>
   But the FTC declared faulty some tests -- the ''HIV &AMP;frac12; Stat-Pak
Ultra Fast'' brand -- that were resold here by a Sovo Tec customer
who was supposed to export them. The FTC stopped sales by that
company, Nevada-based Cyberlinx, but the FDA does allow other
companies to export those tests.
</P>
<P>
   Sovo Tec says it did nothing wrong and it has no complaints
about its exports.

<HEADLINE> Basking Ridge attorney gets 26 months in prison for embezzlement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A Basking Ridge attorney was sentenced
Friday to 26 months in prison for embezzling $64,000 from federally
subsidized rural housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Richards, 65, pleaded guilty in 1998 to embezzling funds
that belonged to six real estate limited partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   He owned Glen Cross Corp., a Clinton construction company which
built the projects in Belvidere, Oxford and Washington in Warren
County, N.J., and Windgap and Bath, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Richards admitted that he took a total of $64,000 from accounts
of each project in 1990 for use by Glen Cross without approval from
the Farmers Home Administration, the now-defunct federal agency
that administered the rural rental program.
</P>
<P>
   He also must pay $69,000 in restitution. In an 18-count
indictment, prosecutors alleged there were $120,000 worth of thefts
from the projects. Richards pleaded guilty to six of those counts.

<HEADLINE> Brooklyn woman slain after suspect's monitoring system fails  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - On the night of Sept. 6, robbery suspect Gerald
Jones should have been under house arrest, an electronic device on
his ankle transmitting signals monitored by his probation officer.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a problem: the device hadn't sent signals for
weeks. Worse, authorities say, the officer never noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently feeling free to roam, Jones, 18, allegedly shot and
killed a young woman in a street dispute with the victim's
boyfriend. He was arraigned late Thursday on murder charges and
ordered held without bail.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying, first reported Thursday in Newsday, was ''the
coldest, most brutal thing I've even seen. ... This girl should not
have been shot,'' Detective James Kucinski told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Jones - his ankle bracelet still on with no sign
of tampering - on Sept. 7 at his parents' house after witnesses
identified him as the shooter of 20-year-old Esme Saint Luc,
prosecutors said. At the time, he allegedly told police: ''Hey, I
have my bracelet on. I couldn't have done this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' attorney, Ita Parnass, declined comment on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Probation officials, meanwhile, were scrambling to explain what
went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The probation officer responsible for Jones, Elmer Anderson, was
suspended after an internal investigation concluded he ignored
daily reports - faxed to the Probation Department by a central
monitoring office - showing that the bracelet had failed. Officials
suspect the device may have never worked - something Anderson
should have realized right away, said department spokesman Jack
Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Either he didn't look at the reports or he didn't react to the
reports,'' Ryan said. ''Either way, he was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The department uses ankle bracelets each day to monitor an
average of 200 defendants under house arrest. Ryan said
malfunctions are rare, and had never before contributed to tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to contact Anderson through his union were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Joseph Silverman sentenced Jones to six months in jail
and six months of house arrest last year after the defendant
pleaded guilty to an armed mugging in Brooklyn. Prosecutors said
yesterday that they had objected to the plea deal as too lenient.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman could not be reached for comment. But Brooklyn
Administrative Judge Michael Pesce said such a sentence is
appropriate when the defendant is a teen-ager with no felony
record.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is, what do you do with an 18-year-old?'' Pesce
said. ''Do you give him a second chance?''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving jail in late June, Jones was fitted with an ankle
bracelet designed to alert the Probations Department if he violated
the terms of his release by wandering away from his
Bedford-Stuyvesant home at night.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant kept daytime appointments with his probation
officer. But authorities said he also discovered he could flout his
house arrest after hours without consequence.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Jones tagged along with a .380-caliber
handgun when a group of young men went to the nearby home of Earl
Pratt, 28, to challenge him to a fight over insults Pratt allegedly
had made about someone who had died, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The men never found Pratt. But they spotted Saint Luc arriving
at Pratt's door. Jones allegedly responded by putting his gun to
her right temple and pulling the trigger. She was pronounced dead
an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there was ever a case of being at the wrong place at the
wrong time, this is it,'' said prosecutor Kyle Reeves said. ''This
was an innocent girl with a future, and it was snuffed out.''

<HEADLINE> Former child advocate says governor's office tried to silence her mdstfng </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Former Child Advocate Linda Pearce
Prestley said Friday that high-ranking officials on Gov. John G.
Rowland's staff interfered with her work so often and with such
intensity that she feared she would be fired merely for doing her
job.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing under subpoena at a legislative hearing, Prestley said
Rowland's co-chief of staff, Peter Ellef, repeatedly chastised her
for critical comments she made about the Department of Children and
Families.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Ellef warned Prestley in writing, ''Don't let it
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, at a meeting at the governor's mansion in
Hartford, Ellef asked her bluntly, ''Who do you think you are?''
Prestley testified.
</P>
<P>
   Her first thought in that ''awkward personal moment'' - which
occurred just after Rowland was re-elected in 1998 - was that,
''I'm not getting invited to the inaugural ball,'' Prestley joked.
She wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   A more serious concern was that her job was in jeopardy,
Prestley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd been put on notice,'' she said. ''I was stunned. I felt I
was having to compromise my standards on the welfare of children in
the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellef, appearing later at the same hearing, denied trying to
intimidate or silence Prestley, although he acknowledged he may
have overstepped his bounds in dealing with the child advocate, an
independent agency created as a watchdog on behalf of children.
</P>
<P>
   ''While I believe my goals were correct it's obvious I pushed
too hard,'' Ellef said. ''There's a fine line between interaction
with the child advocate and interference. My actions sent the wrong
signal and for that I apologize. It will not happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Rowland said Ellef has been chastised by the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Ellef, testifying before the legislature's judiciary committee,
admitted he had a ''less than perfect'' relationship with Prestley,
who is now a Superior Court judge. But Ellef blamed the rift on the
fact that both were ''strong-willed people'' who did back down from
a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Prestley served as child advocate from December 1997 until
March, when she accepted Rowland's appointment to the bench
</P>
<P>
   Ellef and other administration officials said Rowland respects
the independence of the child advocate's office, having played a
key role in its creation in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has never been the policy of the governor's office to
interfere with, direct or influence the office of child advocate,''
Ellef said.
</P>
<P>
   A trail of memos from Ellef to Prestley told a different story,
however. The memos, copies of which were distributed at Friday's
hearing, showed Ellef repeatedly expressing irritation with
Prestley over comments she made in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   In memos and handwritten comments on the side of newspaper
stories, Ellef urged Prestley not to make recommendations without
cost estimates and repeatedly chastised her for failing to give the
governor's office advance notice.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the child advocate is required to be independent of all
state agencies charged with protecting and serving children,
including DCF.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say that no one - including the governor - can demand
that the child advocate follow a set of rules for speaking publicly
about systemic problems, even if those comments reflect badly on
DCF or the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Prestley, who testified for nearly four hours Friday, said the
legislature should clarify how - or if- the child advocate can be
fired and what its relationship with the governor's office should
be.
</P>
<P>
   ''I worried for 2 1/2 years that I'd be fired,'' she said,
adding that by the nature of the job, the child advocate will
inevitably say things that make the administration unhappy or even
angry.
</P>
<P>
   No legislation came out of Friday's hearing, but lawmakers said
bills related to the child advocate's office would be submitted
next year.

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Jail Rations, Bjt,680  </HEADLINE>
By LORI HINNANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Doing 99 years in the slam? No
problem: This Mercer County community has got food that'll last
that long.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to cut costs and save police officers a trip to the
local fast-food joint, the mayor of Hamilton Township is offering
jail inmates military food rations that come in a pouch and last
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Glen Gilmore said Friday that the idea for the rations -
dubbed Meals Ready to Eat or MREs - came after he learned that the
township jail sent officers to fetch fast food meals for inmates at
a cost of $1.94. He said the MREs would cost the town one dollar
and could be stockpiled for months at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly just about anyone would prefer a Big Mac over an
MRE, but we're not a restaurant, we're a jail,'' he said. ''If
someone has a problem with what we serve, there's one solution and
that's to stay out of our jails.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore said the jail sees about 1,500 inmates a year, who each
stay typically no more than one or two nights on minor charges -
less if they make bail.
</P>
<P>
   Before the purchase of the MREs this week, Gilmore said officers
would go out and bring back fast food for the inmates. He said the
new meals will leave police free to enforce the law, rather than
act as kitchen assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Vinnie Capodanno said he sees ulterior motives in the
new meal plan.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the mayor, a former prosecutor, of trying to bolster
waning popularity by picking on a group of people no one wants to
defend publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ''These aren't what we would consider hard-core prisoners. This
is a lockup overnight - or two to three days for people who are in
there who maybe can't pay their bail,'' Capodanno said. ''I think
his purposes here are just for publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Capodanno said the Township Council has no plans to oppose the
mayor on the food rations, but questions the $4,000 savings when he
said the mayor recently hired a press secretary and has a
town-owned car.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he wants to serve rations go ahead, but I think if this
mayor's interested in saving money, let him turn in his car,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore dismissed the criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   ''I already had one of my council members complaining that we
were inviting a lawsuit by doing it. Last time I checked, there is
no constitutional right to a Big Mac,'' he said. ''There's no
question this is a nutritional meal. These are the meals we serve
our men and women in uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Col. John Dwyer, a New Jersey Air National Guard spokesman, said
the meals, which come in a sealed pouch that also contains a
heating pack activated by water, fulfill nutritional requirements
for ''soldiers who are out there doing a whole physical day's
work.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimated the packs contain about 3,000 calories each, and
have options that can meet kosher, Islamic and vegetarian
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really like fast food in a lot of ways, and many of the
menu choices are like fast food,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer would not say whether the packs would be appropriate for
jail inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have absolutely no way to gauge that,'' he said. ''I can
only speak for the military and the New Jersey National Guard.''
</P>
<P>
   David Flood, the vice president of the Township Council, is
concerned that they would not.
</P>
<P>
   ''From what I know of food service in the prisons, you do have
to make provisions for special diets,'' he said. ''Army rations are
not provisions for special diets.''
</P>
<P>
   Flood said with the town's budget bigger than ever, he doesn't
see the rations as a significant cost-cutting or crime prevention
measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see this as an anti-crime thing,'' he said. ''It's
kind of kicking somebody when they're down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gilmore said for Hamilton, the MREs could prove better than
the fast food that many people crave.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly they don't come close to Mom's cooking,'' he said.
''I hope it's one more reason that people won't want to be in our
jail.''

<HEADLINE> Firm's plans to create as many as 500 jobs questioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GLENVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - A state official said a transportation
company that promised 500 jobs at an upstate plant is selling its
bus division and the economic boost is still anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1999, Breda Transportation officials announced plans to
invest $16 million in its new facility at the Scotia-Glenville
Industrial Park in Schenectady County. The company said it would
rehabilitate a 240,000-square-foot facility and possible expand
into an adjoining building.
</P>
<P>
   But town and county officials told the Daily Gazette of
Schenectady that renovation plans were nowhere in site.
</P>
<P>
   ''Breda's vanished from the planet, as far as we can tell,''
said Schenectady County Economic Development Director George
Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Paolo Longo, a vice president at Breda's New York City
headquarters, was out of the office Friday. A receptionist there
said Longo is the only one who can answer questions about the
Schenectady County facility.
</P>
<P>
   Empire State Development spokeswoman Maura Gallucci said Breda
is selling its bus division and that the agency is working with the
company to identify prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are negotiations active with several interested
parties,'' she said. ''We are confident that a new manufacturer
will be identified.''
</P>
<P>
   The company had a $22 million deal to build 75 buses for the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority but ''never signed on the
dotted line,'' MTA spokesman Tom Kelly said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Tones Down Its War Games  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUKOU, Taiwan (AP) -- Summer is the peak season for war games in
Taiwan, and the lesson from this year's drills seems to be that the
island is seriously avoiding inflaming relations with rival China.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the military has ushered reporters to mock
battles involving tanks, artillery, jets and warships -- displays
designed to send strong warning signals to China.
</P>
<P>
   But media tours this week for the military's largest-scale
drills have focused on unthreatening maneuvers, such as bridge
building and relief work for natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Although Taiwan has not explicitly stated that it is keeping its
summer drills low key because of China, military officials --
speaking on customary condition of anonymity -- have acknowledged
that the armed forces were working harder this year not to
antagonize their communist foes.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to actual combat training that reporters were
allowed to cover was held Friday at a base in this northern
Taiwanese city, where reservists practiced setting up traps to stop
paratroopers.
</P>
<P>
   At a practice field that looked like a set for a Mad Max movie,
troops unwound spools of barbed wire and furiously dug holes for
sharp bamboo poles designed to impale paratroopers. Abandoned cars
were half-buried in the ground and spears were attached to their
bumpers, ready to stick attackers falling from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   China and Taiwan have been ruled separately since the Communists
captured the mainland in 1949, and Beijing has threatened to attack
if the island seeks independence.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, China has toned down its rhetoric and has not
publicized threatening war games of its own. Chinese leaders have
said they are closely watching new Taiwanese President Chen
Shui-bian, who is distrusted in Beijing because of his past vocal
support for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has repeatedly invited Chinese leaders to a summit, but
Beijing has insisted that before talks begin, Chen must agree that
Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. Chen has refused to accept
preconditions for a meeting, but has offered to discuss any issue
with his Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Chen observed the drills and gave a speech that was a
mixture of soothing words for Beijing and warnings that Taiwan
stood ready to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said he was still committed to his policy of increasing
''goodwill, reconciliation, cooperation and permanent peace'' with
China. But he also mentioned that China has been building up its
military and Taiwan still faces a real threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to guarantee our existence and protect the safety of
our people and their property, we must continue to strengthen our
defenses,'' Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Hit-target judge gives up case of stock fraud defendant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan judge removed herself Friday from
the securities fraud trial of a former brokerage executive who
allegedly hired a hit man to kill her so he could get her off the
case.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Leslie Crocker Snyder said she knows
she could be fair while trying Stuart Winkler, 47, of Morganville,
N.J., but said she would give up the case to avoid ''the appearance
of impropriety.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge noted that Justice Micki Scherer, chief administrative
judge of the Manhattan criminal courts, had denied defense motions
for her to order Snyder off the stock fraud case.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler was indicted on conspiracy and criminal solicitation
charges for allegedly trying to have Snyder slain. In June, he
allegedly arranged with a fellow jail inmate to kill Snyder, who
had set Winkler's bail at $1 million cash, so he could get another
judge who might lower his bail.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler, former chief financial officer at A.S. Goldmen Co. of
Naples, Fla., his firm, and 32 other people were indicted in June
1999 on a charge of enterprise corruption for participating in
massive securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   They were accused of bilking investors, many of them elderly,
out of more than $100 million dollars by lying to them,
unauthorized trading, ignoring sell orders, forgery, and outright
theft. Winkler has pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler's lawyer, Richard Asche, said in motion papers that the
judge should remove herself from the stock fraud case because ''it
would be beyond human capacity for Justice Snyder ... to sit
impartially in judgment of an individual who is alleged to have
conspired to kill her.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder disagreed. ''I have no doubt that I could give Mr.
Winkler a fair trial,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   But Snyder agreed with Asche's statement that she could create
the appearance of impropriety if she stayed on Winkler's case.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would sever Winkler's case from that of the other
stock fraud defendants, ''not so much because he wanted to bump me
off,'' but in large part because of the massive publicity after his
indictment for the alleged attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Asche said Snyder's stepping down was ''the only thing she could
do.''

<HEADLINE> 361 Named As White House Sleepovers  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife, Hillary,
hosted 404 overnight guests at the White House or Camp David over
the last 14 months, the White House said Friday. Collectively they
gave $624,000 to the first lady's Senate campaign, according to an
analysis by a watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list was released in the face of accusations that Mrs.
Clinton rewarded donors with sleepovers since she began her Senate
campaign. Roughly one in four of the guests contributed to her
race, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's certainly no basis for believing that they are
anything other than what they are, which is friends and
supporters,'' Mrs. Clinton said while campaigning in Greenburgh,
N.Y., north of New York City. ''There just really isn't any reason
for anybody to raise any questions about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Rick Lazio, Mrs. Clinton's rival, said the
accounting was ''absolutely insufficient'' because it did not
specify when guests stayed, or whether they were at the White House
or Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said the White House was trying to ''obfuscate finding out
whether or not people were seeking or offered the opportunity to
stay at a military installation or at government property in return
for campaign favors.''
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonpartisan watchdog group, said 98 of the guests gave a combined
$108,000 directly to Mrs. Clinton's Senate committee and an
additional $516,000 to affiliated committees operating on her
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the guests -- 146 in all -- have been active
contributors this election cycle, the center said. They gave a
combined $5.5 million in campaign contributions, of which 98
percent went to the Democratic Party or Democratic candidates. Some
$122,000 went to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The guests, more than one a day on average, included Hollywood
celebrities, political leaders, donors, Arkansas pals and others.
The list named 361 sleepover guests but omitted the names of 43
other people who are family or friends of Chelsea Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list included former Slim-Fast head S. Daniel Abraham,
who has given $993,000 to Democratic Party committees since Jan. 1,
1999 -- more than any other individual donor -- and $20,000 to
Clinton's legal defense fund. Also, filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who
has given $140,000 to the Democratic National Committee, $7,000 to
New York Senate 2000 and $10,000 to the president's legal defense
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Other big donors were Norman Pattiz, chairman of the Westwood
One radio network, who has given $300,000 to Democratic committees;
and Vinod Gupta, president of InfoUSA, who has given $100,000.
Gupta gave a fund raiser for Mrs. Clinton in March that raised
about $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta said he stayed in the Lincoln Bedroom last September or
October while helping plan the millennium celebration. ''Mrs.
Clinton said, 'Why don't you stay here,''' he said. ''Who wouldn't
want to stay there?''
</P>
<P>
   But Gupta said he came away feeling, ''I wouldn't want to stay
there ever again. Everybody's watching you. ... One night is
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Another overnight guest was Paul Adler, chairman of the Rockland
County Democratic Party in New York, who was indicted this month on
federal fraud, bribery and extortion charges. He gave $1,500 to
Mrs. Clinton's campaign and was host at a fund-raiser for her.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Tullman of Chicago, head of Tunes.com, and his wife,
Judith, gave $16,000 to Mrs. Clinton's campaign and another
political committee set up for her. He rejected suggestions that
White House stays were used to raise money. ''Well, that certainly
didn't work with us,'' he said. ''We're just small potatoes people
-- no big donors.''
</P>
<P>
   Some overnight guests were big contributors to Clinton's legal
defense fund: John Manning of Boston, chief executive officer of
Boston Capitol Corp., who gave $30,000; programming executive Haim
Sabin and his wife, Cheryl, who gave $20,000 apiece; and actor
Chevy Chase, who gave $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other guest-donors were veteran Democratic fund-raiser Terence
McAuliffe and his family; and several New York political leaders,
including former state Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman,
Manhattan Borough President Virginia Fields, former Rep. Floyd
Flake and state Assemblyman Tom DiNapoli, the Nassau County
Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Also listed was a string of celebrities whose names do not
appear on campaign contribution lists for Mrs. Clinton: Meg Ryan
and her husband, Dennis Quaid; Danny Devito and his wife, Rhea
Perlman; and Will Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, asked about the sleepovers, said,
''It is their private residence, but they have also said that this
is the people's house. You've just got to look at the particular
facts. If the president of the United States wants to invite
somebody to stay at his -- what is, in effect, his home for a
four-year period or an eight-year period -- he ought to be able to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unapologetic for the sleepovers, press secretary Joe Lockhart
said, ''The Clintons will continue to invite guests to visit with
them at the White House and at Camp David during the president's
remaining months in office.''
</P>
<P>
   The list covered guests who stayed overnight from July 1, 1999,
through Aug. 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The list was broken down into six categories: Arkansas friends,
51 people; longtime friends, 102; friends and supporters, 86;
officials and dignitaries, 77; arts and letters and sports, 45; and
family and friends of Chelsea Clinton, 43.

<HEADLINE> Former child advocate says governor's office tried to silence her  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Former Child Advocate Linda Pearce
Prestley said Friday that high-ranking officials on Gov. John G.
Rowland's staff interfered with her work so often and with such
intensity that she feared she would be fired merely for doing her
job.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing under subpoena at a legislative hearing, Prestley said
Rowland's co-chief of staff, Peter Ellef, repeatedly chastised her
for critical comments she made about the Department of Children and
Families.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Ellef warned Prestley in writing, ''Don't let it
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, at a meeting at the governor's mansion in
Hartford, Ellef asked her bluntly, ''Who do you think you are?''
Prestley testified.
</P>
<P>
   Her first thought in that ''awkward personal moment'' - which
occurred just after Rowland was re-elected in 1998 - was that,
''I'm not getting invited to the inaugural ball,'' Prestley joked.
She wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   A more serious concern was that her job was in jeopardy,
Prestley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd been put on notice,'' she said. ''I was stunned. I felt I
was having to compromise my standards on the welfare of children in
the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellef, appearing later at the same hearing, denied trying to
intimidate or silence Prestley, although he acknowledged he may
have overstepped his bounds in dealing with the child advocate, an
independent agency created as a watchdog on behalf of children.
</P>
<P>
   ''While I believe my goals were correct it's obvious I pushed
too hard,'' Ellef said. ''There's a fine line between interaction
with the child advocate and interference. My actions sent the wrong
signal and for that I apologize. It will not happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Rowland said Ellef has been chastised by the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Ellef, testifying before the legislature's judiciary committee,
admitted he had a ''less than perfect'' relationship with Prestley,
who is now a Superior Court judge. But Ellef blamed the rift on the
fact that both were ''strong-willed people'' who did not back down
from a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Prestley served as child advocate from December 1997 until
March, when she accepted Rowland's appointment to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Ellef and other administration officials said Rowland respects
the independence of the child advocate's office, having played a
key role in its creation in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has never been the policy of the governor's office to
interfere with, direct or influence the office of child advocate,''
Ellef said.
</P>
<P>
   A trail of memos from Ellef to Prestley told a different story,
however. The memos, copies of which were distributed at Friday's
hearing, showed Ellef repeatedly expressing irritation with
Prestley over comments she made in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   In memos and handwritten comments on the side of newspaper
stories, Ellef urged Prestley not to make recommendations without
cost estimates and repeatedly chastised her for failing to give the
governor's office advance notice.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the child advocate is required to be independent of all
state agencies charged with protecting and serving children,
including DCF.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say that no one - including the governor - can demand
that the child advocate follow a set of rules for speaking publicly
about systemic problems, even if those comments reflect badly on
DCF or the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Prestley, who testified for nearly four hours Friday, said the
legislature should clarify how - or if- the child advocate can be
fired and what its relationship with the governor's office should
be.
</P>
<P>
   ''I worried for 2 1/2 years that I'd be fired,'' she said,
adding that by the nature of the job, the child advocate will
inevitably say things that make the administration unhappy or even
angry.
</P>
<P>
   No legislation came out of Friday's hearing, but lawmakers said
bills related to the child advocate's office would be submitted
next year.

<HEADLINE> White House releases new list of overnight guests  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Clinton and his wife, Hillary,
hosted 404 overnight guests at the White House or Camp David over
the last 14 months, the White House said Friday. Collectively they
gave $624,000 to the first lady's Senate campaign, according to an
analysis by a watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list was released in the face of accusations that Mrs.
Clinton rewarded donors with sleepovers since she began her Senate
campaign. Roughly one in four of the guests contributed to her
race, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's certainly no basis for believing that they are
anything other than what they are, which is friends and
supporters,'' Mrs. Clinton said while campaigning in Greenburgh,
N.Y., north of New York City. ''There just really isn't any reason
for anybody to raise any questions about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Rick Lazio, Mrs. Clinton's rival, said the
accounting was ''absolutely insufficient'' because it did not
specify when guests stayed, or whether they were at the White House
or Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said the White House was trying to ''obfuscate finding out
whether or not people were seeking or offered the opportunity to
stay at a military installation or at government property in return
for campaign favors.'' Mrs. Clinton did not comment on the list,
but in the past has denied that invitations were extended in return
for contributions.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonpartisan watchdog group, said 98 of the guests gave a combined
$108,000 directly to Mrs. Clinton's Senate committee and an
additional $516,000 to affiliated committees operating on her
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the guests - 146 in all - have been active
contributors this election cycle, the center said. They gave a
combined $5.5 million in campaign contributions, of which 98
percent went to the Democratic Party or Democratic candidates. Some
$122,000 went to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The guests, more than one a day on average, included Hollywood
celebrities, political leaders, donors, Arkansas pals and others.
The list named 361 sleepover guests but omitted the names of 43
other people who are family or friends of Chelsea Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list included former Slim-Fast head S. Daniel Abraham,
who has given $993,000 to Democratic Party committees since Jan. 1,
1999 - more than any other individual donor - and $20,000 to
Clinton's legal defense fund. Also, filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who
has given $140,000 to the Democratic National Committee, $7,000 to
New York Senate 2000 and $10,000 to the president's legal defense
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Other big donors were Norman Pattiz, chairman of the Westwood
One radio network, who has given $300,000 to Democratic committees;
and Vinod Gupta, president of InfoUSA, who has given $100,000.
Gupta gave a fund raiser for Mrs. Clinton in March that raised
about $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another overnight guest was Paul Adler, chairman of the Rockland
County Democratic Party in New York, who was indicted this month on
federal fraud, bribery and extortion charges. He gave $1,500 to
Mrs. Clinton's campaign and was host at a fund-raiser for her.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Tullman of Chicago, head of Tunes.com, and his wife,
Judith, gave $16,000 to Mrs. Clinton's campaign and another
political committee set up for her. He rejected suggestions that
White House stays were used to raise money. ''Well, that certainly
didn't work with us,'' he said. ''We're just small potatoes people
- no big donors.''
</P>
<P>
   Some overnight guests were big contributors to Clinton's legal
defense fund: John Manning of Boston, chief executive officer of
Boston Capitol Corp., who gave $30,000; programming executive Haim
Sabin and his wife, Cheryl, who gave $20,000 apiece; and actor
Chevy Chase, who gave $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other guest-donors were veteran Democratic fund-raiser Terence
McAuliffe and his family; and several New York political leaders,
including former state Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman,
Manhattan Borough President Virginia Fields, former Rep. Floyd
Flake and state Assemblyman Tom DiNapoli, the Nassau County
Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Also listed was a string of celebrities whose names do not
appear on campaign contribution lists for Mrs. Clinton: Meg Ryan
and her husband, Dennis Quaid; Danny Devito and his wife, Rhea
Perlman; and Will Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, asked about the sleepovers, said,
''It is their private residence, but they have also said that this
is the people's house. You've just got to look at the particular
facts. If the president of the United States wants to invite
somebody to stay at his - what is, in effect, his home for a
four-year period or an eight-year period - he ought to be able to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unapologetic for the sleepovers, Lockhart said, ''The Clintons
will continue to invite guests to visit with them at the White
House and at Camp David during the president's remaining months in
office.''
</P>
<P>
   The list covered guests who stayed overnight from July 1, 1999,
when Mrs. Clinton began her ''listening tour'' in New York as a
prelude to her campaign for the Senate, through Aug. 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The list was broken down into six categories: Arkansas friends,
51 people; longtime friends, 102; friends and supporters, 86;
officials and dignitaries, 77; arts and letters and sports, 45; and
family and friends of Chelsea Clinton, 43.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was criticized after the 1996
campaign for inviting big donors to spend nights in the Lincoln
Bedroom and elsewhere. Republicans in Congress, and some
less-partisan critics, complained that the practice dulled the
majesty of the White House.

<HEADLINE> Observers Deploy on Ethiopia Border  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- The first U.N. military observers
headed Friday to the Ethiopian-Eritrean border, taking armored cars
and equipment to start preparations for a 4,200-strong peacekeeping
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the real beginning, the moment when we actually
establish the blue beret presence on the front,'' Col. Frederik
Hoogeland, the chief military liaison officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Three five-man teams of unarmed observers, the vanguard of the
United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, or UNMEE, flew on
an Ilyushin-76 transport aircraft to the border area where the two
Horn of Africa neighbors had fought since May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries signed a cessation of hostilities agreement,
though not an official cease-fire, June 18 and agreed to the
deployment of peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Another team of U.N. observers left Asmara, the Eritrean
capital, on Friday for the Eritrean side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just starting up. The aim is to get the mission going
toward deploying the full contingent,'' said Canadian Lt. Col.
Richard Ryder-Burbidge, head of UNMEE operations. He said his men
would start by liaising with local military authorities.
</P>
<P>
   By November, 2,200 peacekeepers should be in place inside the
15-mile-wide buffer zone on the Eritrean side of the border, where
they will monitor the agreement and verify the pull back of
Ethiopian troops from areas that were not under their
administration before the war.
</P>
<P>
   No date is set for the arrival of all 4,200 troops.

<HEADLINE> Paris Plane Lands In Baghdad  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- A French charter flight carrying athletes,
doctors and artists landed in Baghdad on Friday, drawing a sharp
protest from the United States that France was breaking the U.N.
embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The chartered flight carrying some 60 passengers from Paris
arrived at Saddam International Airport, having ignored a request
from the U.N. sanctions committee in New York to wait for
clearance.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher called the
flight a ''blatant violation'' of the sanctions imposed on Iraq
after the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fail to understand why the French government, which has
discussed this at the United Nations for some time, could not wait
12 hours to gain sanctions committee approval of the flight,''
Boucher said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   France insisted the flight did not violate sanctions, but its
refusal to wait for U.N. authorization was the latest effort by
Iraq's council supporters -- France, Russia and China -- to chip away
at sanctions. Russia plans a similar flight Saturday, for which it
said it was not seeking U.N. authorization.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands' U.N. Ambassador Peter van Walsum, who chairs
the sanctions committee, said he expects the Security Council to
discuss the matter of the French flight. A meeting was expected
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the only instance I can remember of a flight being
notified to the committee but then going against the procedures of
the committee to wait for 24 hours,'' Britain's U.N. Ambassador
Jeremy Greenstock said, calling France's move ''a pity.''
</P>
<P>
   French Foreign Ministry spokesman Francois Rivasseau said the
flight ''was essentially to send doctors and surgeons to Iraq'' and
should not be confused with regular civilian flights, which
sanctions prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is absolutely not a violation of the embargo,'' Rivasseau
told reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Deputy Ambassador James Cunningham disagreed, telling the
Security Council during a discussion on the flight, ''This is a
very regrettable occurrence from our point of view and we would
hope it doesn't happen again, but I don't have any confidence in
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the French athletes on board the flight were
rollerskaters from Paris. A dozen put on a lively display of their
skills, wearing rollerskates and inline skates, in front of the
Boeing 737 plane.
</P>
<P>
   An Iraqi Olympic Committee official, Hussein Saeed, welcomed the
French group, saying they had taken ''a big initiative in breaking
the embargo'' imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   France informed the U.N. sanctions committee on Iraq on Thursday
night that the humanitarian flight would be taking off early
Friday, but refused a request to delay the flight for an additional
12 hours so the issue could be studied.
</P>
<P>
   France's U.N. Ambassador Jean-David Levitte said in a letter
circulated to Security Council members Friday that his government
acted entirely within the sanctions committee's regulations,
stressing that only notification -- not U.N. authorization -- was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and the United States said they hadn't objected to the
French flight, but had asked for a delay to find out details of the
passengers and its humanitarian purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sent a similar flight to Iraq last Sunday and received
committee approval -- although its passengers included oil
executives seeking deals in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador Gennadi Gatilov said Russia had
notified the Security Council of its plans for Saturday's flight,
but was not seeking approval. ''From the legal point of view, we
believe we have the right to send it,'' he told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Itar-Tass news agency said the flight would carry
humanitarian supplies, a youth soccer team, a musical group and
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The increased flights, with their questionable passenger lists
and last-minute notifications, are an indication of the growing
challenge to sanctions, which critics maintain hurt the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday there could
be no letup on sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our responsibility to hold the line and to make the
sanction system work,'' Albright said. She did not mention the
planned French flight.
</P>
<P>
   The French visitors belong to an anti-sanctions group called the
French Office for the Development of Industry and Culture. They
plan to spend three to four days in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The artists intend to perform at the Babylon International
Festival, a cultural event that began Friday night. The doctors
plan to visit Baghdad hospitals, and the athletes were expected to
meet and practice with their Iraqi counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   In the flap over flights, France maintains that U.N. sanctions
do not bar passenger or humanitarian flights to Iraq -- only cargo
flights.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute overshadowed a closed-door briefing Friday by the
chief U.N. weapons for Iraq, Hans Blix on progress resuming weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Blix, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, told reporters that
council members expressed overwhelming support for his efforts to
get inspectors back to Iraq. But he acknowledged that they may not
be allowed into Iraq any time soon.

<HEADLINE> US To Pay $380K in Ruby Ridge Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government paid $380,000 Friday to
Kevin Harris, who alleged his rights were violated when an FBI
sniper wounded him during the 1992 Ruby Ridge siege.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department announced the settlement of the last
remaining civil lawsuit arising from the weeklong standoff at the
Idaho compound of white separatist Randy Weaver. The government did
not admit any liability as it paid Harris to drop his $10 million
civil damage suit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the government paid Weaver and his three surviving
children $3.1 million in the killing of Weaver's wife, Vicki, and
son, Samuel.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court
ruling that dismissed state criminal charges against the FBI
sniper, Lon Horiuchi. The same shot by Horiuchi, a member of the
bureau's hostage rescue team, killed Vicki Weaver and wounded
Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General David Ogden said Friday, ''This
settlement resolves this long pending case in a way that is fair to
the United States and all involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ruby Ridge siege, which led to new rules governing when FBI
agents can fire their guns, had its origins in 1991. That year,
Weaver, who had been charged with firearms-related offenses, was
indicted for failure to appeal at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Weaver's case was referred to the U.S. Marshals, who
sought to persuade him to surrender. Instead of surrendering,
Weaver remained on his remote, wooded property along with his wife
and children, and their friend, Harris.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, 1992, while U.S. Marshals were watching the Weaver
property, an exchange of gunfire broke out and resulted in the
deaths of Deputy Marshal William Degan and Weaver's son, Samuel.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Weaver and Harris were later acquitted of federal charges
of killing Degan.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of the standoff, the FBI hostage rescue team
arrived. Horiuchi fired at Harris, who was armed, as Harris
retreated toward the cabin. The bullet passed through the curtained
window of the cabin door, killed Vicki Weaver, who was standing
behind the door holding an infant, and wounded Harris.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department investigated a handful of top FBI
officials for allegedly covering up their role in the siege and
shootings, particularly in drawing up the rules of engagement for
the snipers. One former FBI supervisor, E. Michael Kahoe, pleaded
guilty to obstruction of justice for destroying an internal FBI
post-confrontation critique.
</P>
<P>
   Of the handful who were suspended during the probe, only Kahoe
was charged with a crime. But Deputy Director Larry Potts was
demoted, and he and a top aide of his, Danny Coulson, both left the
government before decisions were reached on whether to impose
administrative discipline.

<HEADLINE> FCC Tweaks Low-Power Radio Plan  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators tweaked their plan to
license hundreds of microradio stations Friday, adding safeguards
to protect radio reading services for the blind from interference.
</P>
<P>
   But the Federal Communications Commission, in a late Friday
afternoon announcement, largely ignored the complaints of
commercial broadcasters, who say low-power service will interfere
with existing FM stations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have always been confident that LPFM can be implemented
without disturbing the integrity of the FM service,'' said FCC
Chairman William Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has come under fierce attack on Capitol Hill, where
many lawmakers have moved legislation to curtail or eliminate the
FCC's plan altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But in Friday's decision, the commission reiterated its view
that the risk from interference by the low-power radio stations --
operating at 10 and 100 watts -- would be small and therefore did
not require a larger buffer zone to protect full-power stations.
</P>
<P>
   By increasing protections, the FCC would be forced to decrease
the number of low-power stations it could authorize.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC did, however, respond to concerns raised by National
Public Radio and others that the low-power stations would harm
so-called reading services for the blind and visually impaired.
Such services, which allow for books or other text to be narrated,
are carried on subcarrier channels.
</P>
<P>
   The commission adopted additional protections for those FM
stations that operate radio reading services, requiring more space
between them and the microradio channels.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of NPR's members air reading services for the
blind on subcarrier channels. NPR said it would review the details
of the changes made by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''NPR's position from day one has been that we believe that
public radio and low power FM can coexist in the future as
complementary services,'' said NPR spokeswoman Siriol Evans. ''From
the very beginning, we have emphasized the importance of
safeguarding radio reading services for the blind and translator
stations that provide programming to remote rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC, while not adding protections for commercial
broadcasters at large, did agree to institute a new interference
complaint procedure. The process would be triggered when a
full-power FM radio station receives complaints from 1 percent of
its listeners in the area likely to experience interference.
</P>
<P>
   Commission field agents would be available to assist low-power
and commercial broadcasters in their attempts to address the
interference. If a solution is not reached, the FCC will take up a
review that it must complete within three months.
</P>
<P>
   National Association of Broadcasters spokesman Dennis Wharton
said the group did not have a chance to review the decision yet,
but ''we already know the FCC plan will allow additional
interference for listeners.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission is close to awarding its first batch of low-power
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Commissioner Michael Powell, backing some of the
commission's decision, continued to raise concerns that low-power
stations could threaten the economic viability of small broadcast
stations.

<HEADLINE> After three weeks of introductory ads, Corzine launches TV attack on Franks </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine went
negative Friday, continuing his heavy spending on television
advertising to launch a new commercial claiming his Republican
opponent, Bob Franks, slashed federal health programs.
</P>
<P>
   Franks campaign manager Charlie Smith denounced the ad as a
distortion of votes Frank had cast in 1995 as a member of Congress.
''This is what wealthy candidates do. Failing to sell themselves,
they then spend millions attacking the opponent,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine campaign manager Steve DeMicco said the new ad, the
fourth of the fall campaign, was fair and was intended to clarify
the differences between Corzine and his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   To date, ''the ads addressed a very specific agenda,'' DeMicco
said. ''The purpose of the new advertising today is to highlight
the contrast.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, a former Wall Street executive, has made health care
for working-class Americans a central issue of his platform,
promising to require employers to provide health insurance and to
expand Medicare to include prescription drug coverage for all
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Franks has attacked Corzine's ideas as
costly and unaffordable. But Franks has not been able to buy TV
advertising to make these points and is not expected to do so for
at least several more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, on the other hand, has been running daily TV spots
since Labor Day on the six network-affiliated stations in New York
and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, all of Corzine's spots have been positive, showing
friendly images of the Democrat while a narrator outlines his
promises. None mentioned Franks by name.
</P>
<P>
   The new ad, scheduled to begin airing this weekend, refers to
Franks by name, links him to Newt Gingrich and accuses him of
voting to cut Medicaid and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the attack ad signaled panic and confirmed Corzine's
three-week TV blitz has been failing at a time when Corzine has
made embarrassing errors on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Smith described controversies over Corzine's use of charitable
gifts as a full-blown scandal. ''On the heels of 'charity-gate' and
Jon Corzine's problems with the truth, I believe it is not a
coincidence that they have decided to move the issue behind them by
buying millions of dollars of attack ads,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DeMicco said this was nonsense, and that the ''contrast'' ad was
being placed now in keeping with a long-range plan.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's ad alleges Franks cut Medicaid and Medicare, basing
the claim on Franks' support for Republican budget measures in
1995. These votes, while Gingrich was House Speaker, have been used
for years by Democratic candidates nationwide to attack Republican
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The ad also faults Franks for his support of GOP presidential
candidate George W. Bush's plan to provide prescription drugs to
seniors through voluntary insurance coverage with government
absorbing some costs so drug companies can provide discounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Corzine ad denounces this as a subsidy to drug companies
with no guarantee of coverage to all. ''With a record like that in
Congress, why should we send Bob Franks to the Senate?'' the ad
asks.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said, ''The fact of the matter is Bob Franks voted to save
Medicare, to increase spending in this plan.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the drug plan Franks and the GOP are promoting does
guarantee coverage to all seniors who want it, while Corzine's
proposal is loaded with mandates and high costs.

<HEADLINE> 911 transcript of crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME, N.Y. (AP) - Here is a portion of the 911 tapes that
outline what was said as dispatchers called for assistance from
Niagara Mohawk in the Nov. 15, 1999 accident that killed Scott L.
Wassel.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters arrived within minutes after Wassel lost control of
his pickup truck and slammed into a utility pole and asked for a
Niagara Mohawk line crew as soon as possible. The dispatcher did
not get an answer initially.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk: ''Yeah, it's going to be an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   911: ''An hour?''
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk: ''They got to get a line crew.''
</P>
<P>
   911: ''OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, a Rome fire lieutenant at the scene reports to
the dispatcher:
</P>
<P>
   Firefighter: ''I've got a man trapped in a vehicle here, and
Niagara Mohawk's telling me they can't get it for an hour. I got
wires on this vehicle. He was talking to us and now he's barely
breathing. I gotta have some action sooner than an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   911: ''We know. I've got my deputies out there. I just called
NiMo for the third time and they don't seem too concerned about it.
They're having their supervisor call me right back to get the grid
shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighter: ''The man was conscious when he was in there when
we first got here. We convinced him not to get out of the vehicle
because of the power lines. Since then, he's gone unconscious on
us. We need some action. Soonest possible. This is life
threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk's supervisor then calls 911.
</P>
<P>
   911: ''There's no way this guy can wait an hour. From the
sheriff of Oneida County we're asking that the grid be shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk: ''What?''
</P>
<P>
   911: ''The grid be shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk: ''The grid?''
</P>
<P>
   911: ''Shut the whole grid down in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk: ''Who's asking that?''
</P>
<P>
   911: ''The sheriff of Oneida County.''
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk: ''Now, if we shut it down, what do you propose
to do?''
</P>
<P>
   911: ''Get the guy out of his vehicle and try to save his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk shut down power from a control center in Syracuse
39 minutes after the first call, according to the 911 tapes.
Firefighters were then able to extricate Wassel, but he died later
at an area hospital.

<HEADLINE> Union executives plead guilty to contempt hearing over teachers strike </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Three officers of the Buffalo teachers
union pleaded guilty Friday to violating a judge's order
prohibiting them from calling a teachers' strike.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Teachers Federation President Philip Rumore, vice
president Edith LeWin and secretary Barbara Bielecki reversed
earlier innocent pleas during the second day of their contempt
trial in state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   They face up to 30 days in jail and $1,000 in fines when they
are sentenced Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been saying this right along. We broke the law, we know
that,'' Rumore said. ''As teachers and officers of the BTF we
wanted to take responsibility for our actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers in the 47,000-student district walked off the job Sept.
7 and again Sept. 14 in violation of the state's Taylor Law and
Supreme Court Justice Kevin Dillon's court order.
</P>
<P>
   The trial's resolution came hours before the anticipated end of
the labor dispute that led to the walkouts.
</P>
<P>
   Rank-and-file members of the union overwhelmingly approved the
five year contract recommended by a state mediator. Of the roughly
2,800 teachers who voted, Rumore said ''maybe 25 to 30'' opposed
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to put this behind us,'' Rumore said after the vote.
''The board is going to have to help us do that. There are a lot of
bad feelings out. There's a lot of anger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education said yes to the plan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal provides no raises in the first year and a raise of
up to 2 percent every six months after that for the next four
years. The district also would provide art, music and gym in
primary grades beginning next year, and be allowed to contract with
outside agencies to provide social services to students and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Also, beginning next year, teachers who retire with at least 15
years with the district would begin to pay for health insurance.

<HEADLINE> Attorney general will make public racial profiling documents  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey residents will be able to view
more than 50,000 state police documents related to racial profiling
by troopers, records now being sought by defense attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. told The Associated Press on
Friday the public deserves to examine these documents. ''I've
decided to make these documents public outside the context of
litigation,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys claimed these records would prove biased troopers
tainted hundreds of arrests. A state Superior Court judge in
Burlington County ruled defendants should have access to all
records related to motor vehicle stops on the New Jersey Turnpike
dating back to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Now all of those criminal cases will be reviewed by the Attorney
General's Office to see if charges should be dismissed, Farmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The state estimates 190 defendants are involved in 130
prosecutions. Most of those cases are now being handled by county
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer directed his staff to have the exact number of cases and
all circumstances detailed by Oct. 1 so the state can decide if the
constitutional rights of any defendants were violated by racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer will decide when and how the records will be available
later that month.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a minimum, we will have some kind of reading room
available,'' the attorney general said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys sought the records to prove their point, but
now Farmer says all residents of New Jersey should see them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you'll see the results of an agency trying to come to
grips with a very difficult issue,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The documents are mostly technical and include radio logs,
operational reports and other state police records. Residents will
not be overwhelmed by the volume of paper involved, Farmer said.
''I think there are a number of documents that are easily
digestible for the public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys suspect the records released will mostly
feature statistical data related to motor vehicle stops. Also
likely to be revealed are internal memos and reports showing when
state police supervisors learned of racial profiling and how they
handled the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think those are going to be pretty telling,'' state Deputy
Public Defender Kevin Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure there are going to be many, many memos showing the
state police hierarchy knew this was a long-standing problem,''
said Walker, one of several attorneys representing clients who
allege racial profiling as a defense.
</P>
<P>
   The state needs to provide an index of the records so the public
can sort through what could be a warehouse of paper, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is a smoking gun there, we want to be able to quickly
review that document,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Burlington County, the judge ordered the state to provide the
defense with internal reports, traffic data, arrest reports,
personnel records and raw data used to compile two attorney
general's reports that detailed State Police racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling, issued in October 1999, applies to the turnpike and
traffic stops made by troopers since January 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a Superior Court judge in Morris County said the
state should disclose materials related to arrests on all roads,
and pushed the date back to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Those rulings came in criminal cases where defendants, mostly
minorities charged with drug offenses, claim their arrests came
after they were stopped primarily because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   The Attorney General's Office initially fought those orders,
claiming there was simply too much information to compile.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in providing the information to the court is one
reason Farmer cited for his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's been long enough. We were starting to get some
questions like why is this taking so long. Frankly, they're
legitimate,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman supports the move to make all of the
information available, spokesman Pete McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As documents become the subject of discovery, it will be
clearly in everyone's best interests to be open to the public,
rather than have them filtered through a defense attorney who
obviously has an agenda,'' McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of racial profiling became widely public after April 23,
1998, when two white troopers on the turnpike fired 11 shots at a
van carrying four men, all minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, then Attorney General Peter Verniero released a
report that said racial profiling is ''real, not imagined.'' The
report acknowledges blacks are not only pulled over more often,
they are far more likely to be searched than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Farmer issued a second State Police report
detailing poor handling of citizen complaints and racial
discrimination within the ranks.

<HEADLINE> Lazio conceded no soft money deal  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAYUGA HEIGHTS, N.Y. (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio conceded late Friday
afternoon that an agreement he had touted earlier that would have
banned all soft money had not been reached after all with U.S.
Senate rival Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he thought from remarks Clinton made on Friday
morning that she had agreed to his proposal to ban all groups from
spending soft money. But Clinton had only offered a deal that
pertained to political parties and not unions and other
organizations backing her.
</P>
<P>
   After Lazio announced the pact during a campaign stop outside a
defense contractor's plant in Kirkwood, calling it a ''historic''
agreement, Clinton's campaign immediately rejected the contention.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides then continued their political gamesmanship,
unleashing a series of press releases detailing how the other side
had killed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Lazio has rejected the offer that I made this morning,''
Clinton said in Greenburgh. ''In the remarks that he and his
campaign made, they reimposed a condition that they had taken off
the table last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign released a letter from Lazio campaign manager Bill
Dal Col, dated Thursday, that said, ''We have dropped our
precondition that you attain the signatures of the outside interest
groups supporting your campaign.'' On Friday, however, the Lazio
campaign said the ''agreement'' covered such groups and Dal Col
sent a letter to Clinton aides saying he expected all soft-money
ads to be pulled by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offer said soft money ads already paid for would run
into next week.
</P>
<P>
   During an early evening press conference, Dal Col accused
Clinton of not negotiating in good faith. He said Lazio intended to
proceed with the pledge and to request that all outside groups pull
pro-Lazio ads by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Lazio questioned Clinton's sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's complaining about outside groups, I'm for keeping
outside groups out,'' Lazio said in Cayuga Heights. ''I'm for
neither side spending any soft money. It's the Clinton campaign
that's addicted to soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has made soft-money spending a major issue for more than a
month. He had insisted that outside groups supporting Clinton, such
as the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League and
the AFL-CIO, also abide by the pact.
</P>
<P>
   In her offer Friday, Clinton said she would urge political
parties backing her not to buy any more issue ads on radio and TV
if Lazio did the same.
</P>
<P>
   She also wants groups closely associated with the Republican and
Conservative parties to agree to the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's make it simple, effective, enforceable and fair,''
Clinton said at a breakfast meeting of the Westchester Women for
Hillary group.
</P>
<P>
   She said later that she included ''other groups'' in the clause
for Lazio because, ''The groups supporting his campaign are clearly
related to the Republican Party. They're not individual
institutional organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she already has an agreement from the Democratic
Party to stop funding soft money TV and radio ads, and will ask the
Liberal Party and the Working Families Party to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party leader Judith Hope and Sen. Robert G.
Torricelli, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, both said Friday they would abide by an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had answered Lazio's demand for a soft money ban by
saying she would not stop using soft money unless Lazio got
agreements from groups supporting him to halt anti-Clinton ads.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he produced documents signed by 14 groups she had
named. Each said they would agree to the ban.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said some groups have ''sent their own letters still
with hedges and conditions and dodges and of course, the Republican
party is missing.''
</P>
<P>
   State GOP Chairman William Powers has suspended pro-Lazio ads
during negotiations for a ban but stopped short of saying he would
still hold off should an agreement be reached. But Dal Col said
Thursday that ''I think we will be able to get everyone in line''
if a deal is worked out.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, head of the AFL-CIO, said he would not go along
with a soft-money ban.
</P>
<P>
   Hard money contributions are limited to $2,000 per donor. There
is no limit on soft money contributions; they can be used to
advocate an issue, boost one candidate or attack an opposing
candidate, but such ads cannot end with a tag line asking voters to
choose a particular candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign has already raised millions of dollars in
soft money; Lazio's campaign does not have its own soft-money
account but has benefited from soft-money spending by outside
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Should soft money be banned, Lazio could have an advantage
because the latest federal filings showed his campaign had more
hard money than hers - $10.2 million to $7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a signed agreement, Lazio also wants all soft
money accounts to be refunded or placed in escrow accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said that under the first
lady's proposed agreement, her soft-money committees would stop
advertising, but could continue to raise funds and would make no
refunds of money already collected.
</P>
<P>
   That means that should the agreement break down later, the
Clinton camp would be poised to resume heavy advertising paid for
with soft-money funds.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said it would be illegal for the Clinton campaign to
transfer normal campaign expenses, such as staff members' salaries,
her travel costs or fund-raising expenses for her regular campaign
committee to the soft-money accounts.

<HEADLINE> Corzine ad attacks Franks on health programs  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   EDITOR'S NOTE: One of a series looking at commercials
run in the
campaign for U.S. Senate in New Jersey.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE: Democrat Jon Corzine
</P>
<P>
   AD FIRM: Shrum, Devine &AMP; Donilon, Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   FORMAT: 30-second television ad.
</P>
<P>
   TEXT:
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: ''In Congress, Bob Franks joined with Newt Gingrich,
voting to cut Medicare by $270 billion, to eliminate federal
nursing home safety standards, to cut Medicaid by $163 billion. He
says the answer to the prescription drug problem is to give a $40
billion taxpayer-financed subsidy to the insurance companies, with
no guarantee of prescription drug coverage in return.
</P>
<P>
   ''With a record like that in Congress, why would we send Bob
Franks to the Senate?''
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO:
</P>
<P>
   Slow motion, grainy image of Franks talking runs through
commercial, ending with a menacing, full-screen close-up. As
Gingrich is referenced, a corner image shows the former House
Speaker making a speech with angry gestures. Other images show a
child in a wheelchair with a broken leg and an elderly man at a
pharmacy counter.
</P>
<P>
   STRATEGY:
</P>
<P>
   The attack ad seizes on an early opportunity to define Franks
negatively before the Republican is able to air his own TV
commercials, which he is not likely to do anytime soon. Ad exploits
the name of former House Speaker Gingrich who is now perceived as
unpopular. Three of the four health care points mentioned touch
issues of concern to seniors, a crucial and reliable voting block.
</P>
<P>
   FACT-CHECK:
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid and Medicare attacks have become standard against
Republican members of Congress who voted with Gingrich on broad
budget issues that affected all federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare changes imposed in 1995 did not reduce the benefits
one dollar. They did, however, lower the growth rate allowed for
Medicare in coming years. Because Medicare spending would have been
higher without these changes, critics call the changes a ''cut''
while defenders claim they saved the program from collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP nationally has proposed a drug program that involves a
payment to drug companies that offer discount packages to seniors.
This can be defined as a ''subsidy,'' but by this standard so then
can many other programs in which government offsets costs in order
to win private sector cooperation. Medicaid, for instance, pays
billions in subsidies to private hospitals willing to treat the
poor.

<HEADLINE> Third crow with West Nile virus found in Baltimore  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX DOMINGUEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) - A dead crow found in a downtown neighborhood
this week has tested positive for the West Nile virus, making it
the third bird found in two weeks in Maryland with the
mosquito-borne virus.
</P>
<P>
   The bird was found Sept. 18 in the Federal Hill section and
tested in a state lab, Mike Morrill, a spokesman for Gov. Parris
Glendening, said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Agriculture planned to spray the
pesticide Permethrin Saturday evening in a 2-mile area around where
the bird was found, including in the Inner Harbor tourist area,
Morrill said.
</P>
<P>
   The department is targeting populations of the Culex mosquito,
which has tested positive for the virus in the past.
</P>
<P>
   State officials sprayed the same insecticide Friday at dusk in
sections of Howard and Baltimore counties, where two birds with
West Nile virus were found last week.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Maryland has been hospitalized with symptoms of the
virus, which can be passed to humans through mosquito bites. West
Nile virus can cause fatal encephalitis, usually among children,
the elderly or people with weak immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   An environmental group expressed concern Friday about the
anti-mosquito spraying, saying the risks of the pesticide outweigh
the threat of West Nile to humans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chance of humans becoming seriously ill from West Nile
virus is very small,'' the Maryland Pesticide Network said.
</P>
<P>
   The group said pesticides such as Permethrin have been linked to
brain cancer in children. It said several Connecticut communities
have opted not to spray for mosquitoes because of such concerns.
</P>
<P>
   However, state officials said the pesticide is harmless and
residents do not have to stay indoor during the spraying. Those who
still have concerns are advised to leave the spray area or remain
inside, Morrill said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-two people have been tested for the West Nile virus this
year, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, one was suffering from encephalitis; 32 had aseptic,
or viral, meningitis; and others suffered from a variety of
diseases or conditions, said John Sweitzer, an epidemiologist with
the state health department.
</P>
<P>
   None tested positive for West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been trying to encourage physicians to submit samples
for testing,'' Sweitzer said. ''And with this publicity, we think
we're going to get a lot more samples rolling in.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents finding dead or dying birds are asked to call the
Department of Natural Resources' toll-free hotline at
1-888-584-3110.

<HEADLINE> 404 Guests Stayed at White House  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife, Hillary,
hosted 404 overnight guests at the White House or Camp David over
the last 14 months, the White House said Friday. Collectively they
gave $624,000 to the first lady's Senate campaign, according to an
analysis by a watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list was released in the face of accusations that Mrs.
Clinton rewarded donors with sleepovers since she began her Senate
campaign. Roughly one in four of the guests contributed to her
race, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's certainly no basis for believing that they are
anything other than what they are, which is friends and
supporters,'' Mrs. Clinton said while campaigning in Greenburgh,
N.Y., north of New York City. ''There just really isn't any reason
for anybody to raise any questions about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Rick Lazio, Mrs. Clinton's rival, said the
accounting was ''absolutely insufficient'' because it did not
specify when guests stayed, or whether they were at the White House
or Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said the White House was trying to ''obfuscate finding out
whether or not people were seeking or offered the opportunity to
stay at a military installation or at government property in return
for campaign favors.''
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonpartisan watchdog group, said 98 of the guests gave a combined
$108,000 directly to Mrs. Clinton's Senate committee and an
additional $516,000 to affiliated committees operating on her
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the guests -- 146 in all -- have been active
contributors this election cycle, the center said. They gave a
combined $5.5 million in campaign contributions, of which 98
percent went to the Democratic Party or Democratic candidates. Some
$122,000 went to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The guests, more than one a day on average, included Hollywood
celebrities, political leaders, donors, Arkansas pals and others.
The list named 361 sleepover guests but omitted the names of 43
other people who are family or friends of Chelsea Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list included former Slim-Fast head S. Daniel Abraham,
who has given $993,000 to Democratic Party committees since Jan. 1,
1999 -- more than any other individual donor -- and $20,000 to
Clinton's legal defense fund. Also, filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who
has given $140,000 to the Democratic National Committee, $7,000 to
New York Senate 2000 and $10,000 to the president's legal defense
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Other big donors were Norman Pattiz, chairman of the Westwood
One radio network, who has given $300,000 to Democratic committees;
and Vinod Gupta, president of InfoUSA, who has given $100,000.
Gupta gave a fund raiser for Mrs. Clinton in March that raised
about $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta said he stayed in the Lincoln Bedroom last September or
October while helping plan the millennium celebration. ''Mrs.
Clinton said, 'Why don't you stay here,''' he said. ''Who wouldn't
want to stay there?''
</P>
<P>
   But Gupta said he came away feeling, ''I wouldn't want to stay
there ever again. Everybody's watching you. ... One night is
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Another overnight guest was Paul Adler, chairman of the Rockland
County Democratic Party in New York, who was indicted this month on
federal fraud, bribery and extortion charges. He gave $1,500 to
Mrs. Clinton's campaign and was host at a fund-raiser for her.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Tullman of Chicago, head of Tunes.com, and his wife,
Judith, gave $16,000 to Mrs. Clinton's campaign and another
political committee set up for her. He rejected suggestions that
White House stays were used to raise money. ''Well, that certainly
didn't work with us,'' he said. ''We're just small potatoes people
-- no big donors.''
</P>
<P>
   Some overnight guests were big contributors to Clinton's legal
defense fund: John Manning of Boston, chief executive officer of
Boston Capitol Corp., who gave $30,000; programming executive Haim
Sabin and his wife, Cheryl, who gave $20,000 apiece; and actor
Chevy Chase, who gave $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other guest-donors were veteran Democratic fund-raiser Terence
McAuliffe and his family; and several New York political leaders,
including former state Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman,
Manhattan Borough President Virginia Fields, former Rep. Floyd
Flake and state Assemblyman Tom DiNapoli, the Nassau County
Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Also listed was a string of celebrities whose names do not
appear on campaign contribution lists for Mrs. Clinton: Meg Ryan
and her husband, Dennis Quaid; Danny Devito and his wife, Rhea
Perlman; and Will Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, asked about the sleepovers, said,
''It is their private residence, but they have also said that this
is the people's house. You've just got to look at the particular
facts. If the president of the United States wants to invite
somebody to stay at his -- what is, in effect, his home for a
four-year period or an eight-year period -- he ought to be able to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unapologetic for the sleepovers, press secretary Joe Lockhart
said, ''The Clintons will continue to invite guests to visit with
them at the White House and at Camp David during the president's
remaining months in office.''
</P>
<P>
   The list covered guests who stayed overnight from July 1, 1999,
through Aug. 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The list was broken down into six categories: Arkansas friends,
51 people; longtime friends, 102; friends and supporters, 86;
officials and dignitaries, 77; arts and letters and sports, 45; and
family and friends of Chelsea Clinton, 43.

<HEADLINE> White House Releases Guest List  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife, Hillary,
hosted 404 overnight guests at the White House or Camp David over
the last 14 months, the White House said Friday. Collectively they
gave $624,000 to the first lady's Senate campaign, according to an
analysis by a watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list was released in the face of accusations that Mrs.
Clinton rewarded donors with sleepovers since she began her Senate
campaign. Roughly one in four of the guests contributed to her
race, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's certainly no basis for believing that they are
anything other than what they are, which is friends and
supporters,'' Mrs. Clinton said while campaigning in Greenburgh,
N.Y., north of New York City. ''There just really isn't any reason
for anybody to raise any questions about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Rick Lazio, Mrs. Clinton's rival, said the
accounting was ''absolutely insufficient'' because it did not
specify when guests stayed, or whether they were at the White House
or Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said the White House was trying to ''obfuscate finding out
whether or not people were seeking or offered the opportunity to
stay at a military installation or at government property in return
for campaign favors.''
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonpartisan watchdog group, said 98 of the guests gave a combined
$108,000 directly to Mrs. Clinton's Senate committee and an
additional $516,000 to affiliated committees operating on her
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the guests -- 146 in all -- have been active
contributors this election cycle, the center said. They gave a
combined $5.5 million in campaign contributions, of which 98
percent went to the Democratic Party or Democratic candidates. Some
$122,000 went to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The guests, more than one a day on average, included Hollywood
celebrities, political leaders, donors, Arkansas pals and others.
The list named 361 sleepover guests but omitted the names of 43
other people who are family or friends of Chelsea Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list included former Slim-Fast head S. Daniel Abraham,
who has given $993,000 to Democratic Party committees since Jan. 1,
1999 -- more than any other individual donor -- and $20,000 to
Clinton's legal defense fund. Also, filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who
has given $140,000 to the Democratic National Committee, $7,000 to
New York Senate 2000 and $10,000 to the president's legal defense
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Other big donors were Norman Pattiz, chairman of the Westwood
One radio network, who has given $300,000 to Democratic committees;
and Vinod Gupta, president of InfoUSA, who has given $100,000.
Gupta gave a fund raiser for Mrs. Clinton in March that raised
about $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta said he stayed in the Lincoln Bedroom last September or
October while helping plan the millennium celebration. ''Mrs.
Clinton said, 'Why don't you stay here,''' he said. ''Who wouldn't
want to stay there?''
</P>
<P>
   But Gupta said he came away feeling, ''I wouldn't want to stay
there ever again. Everybody's watching you. ... One night is
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Another overnight guest was Paul Adler, chairman of the Rockland
County Democratic Party in New York, who was indicted this month on
federal fraud, bribery and extortion charges. He gave $1,500 to
Mrs. Clinton's campaign and was host at a fund-raiser for her.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Tullman of Chicago, head of Tunes.com, and his wife,
Judith, gave $16,000 to Mrs. Clinton's campaign and another
political committee set up for her. He rejected suggestions that
White House stays were used to raise money. ''Well, that certainly
didn't work with us,'' he said. ''We're just small potatoes people
-- no big donors.''
</P>
<P>
   Some overnight guests were big contributors to Clinton's legal
defense fund: John Manning of Boston, chief executive officer of
Boston Capitol Corp., who gave $30,000; programming executive Haim
Sabin and his wife, Cheryl, who gave $20,000 apiece; and actor
Chevy Chase, who gave $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other guest-donors were veteran Democratic fund-raiser Terence
McAuliffe and his family; and several New York political leaders,
including former state Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman,
Manhattan Borough President Virginia Fields, former Rep. Floyd
Flake and state Assemblyman Tom DiNapoli, the Nassau County
Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Also listed was a string of celebrities whose names do not
appear on campaign contribution lists for Mrs. Clinton: Meg Ryan
and her husband, Dennis Quaid; Danny Devito and his wife, Rhea
Perlman; and Will Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, asked about the sleepovers, said,
''It is their private residence, but they have also said that this
is the people's house. You've just got to look at the particular
facts. If the president of the United States wants to invite
somebody to stay at his -- what is, in effect, his home for a
four-year period or an eight-year period -- he ought to be able to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unapologetic for the sleepovers, press secretary Joe Lockhart
said, ''The Clintons will continue to invite guests to visit with
them at the White House and at Camp David during the president's
remaining months in office.''
</P>
<P>
   The list covered guests who stayed overnight from July 1, 1999,
through Aug. 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The list was broken down into six categories: Arkansas friends,
51 people; longtime friends, 102; friends and supporters, 86;
officials and dignitaries, 77; arts and letters and sports, 45; and
family and friends of Chelsea Clinton, 43.

<HEADLINE> Judge dismisses coach's lawsuit against Nike  </HEADLINE>
By AVIVA L. BRANDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - A federal judge has dismissed an $11
million lawsuit filed by an assistant soccer coach who claimed he
was forced to quit because he refused to wear Nike's ubiquitous
swoosh.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in New York,
Judge Allen G. Schwartz found no legal merit to any of the claims
made by plaintiff Jim Keady, including: federal civil rights and
human rights violations, criminal conspiracy, defamation and breach
of contract.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also named St. John's University in Jamaica, N.Y.,
as a co-defendant.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a multimillion-dollar licensing deal between the
nation's largest Roman Catholic university and the Beaverton-based
sneaker company. Under the deal, the university's coaches and
athletes wore athletic equipment adorned with the Nike logo.
</P>
<P>
   Keady, a graduate assistant who worked with the team's goalies,
said he became aware of Nike's oft-criticized overseas factories
while studying for his master's degree in theology at St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   He soon became convinced that supporting Nike's ''sweatshops''
was ''in direct violation of the social teaching of the Catholic
Church and the mission of our university.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged that Nike and the university, angry that
Keady went public with his position, ''forced him to resign and
conducted a campaign to discredit (Keady) and his reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schwartz found no evidence to support Keady's claims. He
also denied Keady's motion to amend his lawsuit to add racketeering
charges against Nike.
</P>
<P>
   ''Plaintiff's proposed amended complaint does not cure any of
the deficiencies in the original complaint,'' Schwartz wrote in his
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also criticized Keady for waiting five months to try
to add new allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court finds that (the) plaintiff acted in bad faith, and
with intention to unduly delay this litigation,'' Schwartz wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Keady was overseas and unavailable for comment. His attorneys
did not immediately return telephone messages seeking comment late
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Both Nike and St. John's officials praised the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Sydney, Australia, where he is
attending the Olympics, Nike spokesman Vada Manager said the
company was vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ''He failed the test legally, factually, as well as by acting in
bad faith,'' Manager said.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, St. John's spokesman Jody Fisher said,
''The ruling clearly reaffirms our position, which we have
steadfastly maintained.''

<HEADLINE> Countries Mixed On U.S. Oil Release  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA OLSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- OPEC's president said President
Clinton's decision Friday to release oil from America's strategic
stockpile would bring down prices, and Britain, battered by
truckers' blockades over high fuel costs, praised the move.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton directed the release of 30 million barrels of oil from
the country's emergency reserves in a bid to lower prices. His top
energy adviser cited a looming home heating crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In Caracas, Venezuela's oil minister, who currently holds the
rotating presidency of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, said Clinton's move would help counter oil market
speculation -- which OPEC has blamed for high prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it will strongly affect (oil prices). Already at this
moment they must be falling,'' Ali Rodriguez said in a radio
interview. ''This is in some way an anti-speculative measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, however, Rodriguez cautioned that the effect on prices
from a dip into U.S. reserves would not last. ''Prices will fall,
but the effect will be temporary,'' he said in an interview just
before the Clinton administration announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also said U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
planned to visit Venezuela to discuss Clinton's action. He provided
no details.
</P>
<P>
   News of Clinton's decision broke at close to midnight on Friday,
Islam's weekly holy day, in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, so there
was little immediate reaction there.
</P>
<P>
   But a Saudi government official, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity, called the move ''an election ploy requested by Al
Gore. It seems that his request was granted by Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, which has been battered by truckers' blockades over
high fuel costs, Prime Minister Tony Blair praised the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that this move, along with other efforts being made at
the international level, will help to bring about a reduction in
oil prices in the very near future,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Venezuela hosts OPEC's second-ever summit, at a time
when oil prices have soared to levels not seen since the 1991
Persian Gulf War. Rodriquez said they would not discuss boosting
output. ''There's enough crude oil on the market, and we have
enough potential capacity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC maintains that high oil prices stem from sluggish refining
activity, high taxes and speculation, not lack of supplies of
crude.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's vice oil minister, Alvaro Silva Calderon, said
before the U.S. announcement that releasing any reserves would
''have little effect because the problem is elsewhere. It's in
refineries.''
</P>
<P>
   OPEC has increased production three times this year by a total
of 3.2 million barrels of oil a day, yet prices are hovering around
10-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Venezuela's state oil monopoly had welcomed any move
to release oil from the U.S. reserve, saying it would help
stabilize world prices. Hector Ciavaldini, president of Petroleos
de Venezuela, said the move also would prove OPEC's point that
factors other than OPEC production -- taxes, supply bottlenecks and
refining capacity -- also determine prices.

<HEADLINE> Study To Examine Tobacco Farmers  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton announced Friday that a
commission will be appointed to study ways to help tobacco farmers.
Republicans say it's an election-year ploy to give Vice President
Al Gore a boost in tobacco-growing states.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tobacco growers, like many other farmers, have confronted
difficult economic circumstances these last few years as tobacco
companies increasingly turn to foreign tobacco,'' Clinton said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans from tobacco-growing states say Clinton
administration policies have hurt the tobacco industry and forced
companies to look overseas for cheaper tobacco. The White House has
pushed for increased taxes on cigarettes and pursued costly
litigation against the companies.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Rep. Ernie Fletcher, who represents central Kentucky's
burley tobacco-growing region, said Clinton's announcement ''reeks
of election-year politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush is favored in
most tobacco-growing states but several are in play, including
Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government sets limits on domestic tobacco sales by
issuing quotas. More imports and declining domestic cigarette sales
have prompted the government to reduce quotas, cutting into
farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky Democratic Gov. Paul Patton praised Clinton's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because it's an election year is no reason to stop
working on behalf of the people we serve. Our farm families are
hurting now, and they are searching for future security in an
industry full of uncertainty,'' Patton said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has proposed a 20-year federal buyout of tobacco
quotas at a price tag of $16 billion. He also said he wants to find
ways to bring down the high price of U.S. tobacco so it is more in
line with the world market.
</P>
<P>
   The White House commission is to be made up of tobacco farmers,
health officials and economic development experts who have yet to
be named.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tapped Rod Kuegel, president of the Burley Tobacco
Growers Cooperative, and Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign
for Tobacco-Free-Kids, as co-chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is charged with advising the president on how to help
tobacco farmers while still protecting the public from dangers
associated with smoking. It is expected to issue a preliminary
report by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The American Lung Association issued a statement supporting the
commission and suggested a new tax on cigarettes could help fund
any government payments to tobacco farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville-based Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. called
Clinton's announcement ''a cynical attempt to buy votes from a
group that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore have been trying to put out of
business for eight years.''

<HEADLINE> Despite Cancer, ND Candidate Running  </HEADLINE>
By DALE WETZEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- The Democratic nominee for governor has
breast cancer but will remain in the race, her campaign confirmed
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Heitkamp, the state attorney general, has cancer in her
right breast, her campaign said. She had earlier said that cancer
cells had been found in a lymph node, but tests Thursday and Friday
discovered the disease. It has not spread beyond the lymph node,
the campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, Heidi remains very much still in this race.
She's strong and energetic,'' campaign manager Denise Lawson said.
The diagnosis ''is certainly helpful news, because now we know what
she's up against, and the next step is treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Heitkamp was said to be at her home in Mandan. She was not
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Heitkamp, 44, is trying to become the state's first female
governor. She is running against Republican John Hoeven, 43, the
former president of the Bank of North Dakota. It is the nation's
only state-owned bank.
</P>
<P>
   Both are vying to replace Republican Gov. Ed Schafer, who is
retiring after two terms.
</P>
<P>
   Heitkamp carried through with some campaign events after
learning of the diagnosis. She was in Washington on Tuesday at a
campaign fund-raiser that featured President Clinton, but canceled
other appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Her running mate, state Sen. Aaron Krauter, is filling in for
her at some campaign stops.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues in the campaign is North Dakota's employment
growth, ranked 49th among the states in an analysis earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Census data published last December also estimated that North
Dakota was one of only three states to lose population during the
1990s, declining 0.8 percent to 633,666. For 1998, the most recent
year available, per capita personal income was $21,708, far below
the national average of $26,482.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Won't Deploy Military in Congo  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations ruled out deployment of
U.N. military observers to Congo for at least two more months on
Friday because of increased fighting, obstruction from the
government and its call to revise the country's peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the Security Council, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan also questioned whether the 250 preliminary troops already
deployed in Congo and surrounding countries should remain because
of the deteriorating situation in Congo and fears for their
security.
</P>
<P>
   He recommended the council extend the mandate of the mission for
just two months to give the warring factions time to demonstrate
their commitment to the peace process and show that the conditions
for the deployment of 500 military observers, backed by 5,000
troops and support staff, had been met.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said that lack of progress in the peace process would make
it difficult to justify troop presence and additional deployment in
the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear that United Nations peacekeeping operations cannot
serve as a substitute for the political will to achieve a peaceful
settlement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congo's peace process began unraveling soon after it was signed
last year, with repeated violations of the cease-fire that have
increased recently with intense fighting in Equateur province and
North and South Kivu provinces between the government and rebel
forces backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Laurent Kabila, meanwhile, has
created a series of obstacles that have held up U.N. deployment,
including an anti-U.N. propaganda campaign. In addition, his
refusal to work with a regionally appointed mediator has cast doubt
on the government's willingness to engage in a process of national
dialogue mandated by the peace agreement to form a broad-based
government.
</P>
<P>
   The government has most recently questioned the validity of the
cease-fire agreement and called for its revision -- a move that
could seriously complicate the U.N. mission since it was authorized
specifically to monitor the agreement as it was signed in Lusaka,
Zambia, last year by the rebels and their backers and Kabila and
his backers Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the problems, the United Nations has undertaken
an entire reassessment of the U.N. Mission in Congo and held up
future deployment pending ''unequivocal'' demonstrations by the
warring sides of ''their will to move the peace process forward and
to create conditions necessary'' for the next phase of deployment,
Annan said.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Extends Burn Ban  </HEADLINE>
By SANDY WEST
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A chamber of commerce in the northeast of
fire-stricken Oklahoma had a dilemma on its hands Friday: More than
1,000 pounds of thawed catfish bought and paid for and nowhere to
cook it.
</P>
<P>
   The potentially odoriferous problem arose after Gov. Frank
Keating expanded the state's burn ban to include all charcoal and
gas grilling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just rained on their parade,'' said Jack Carson, spokesman
with the state Agriculture Department. He said officials were
working with the South Grand Lake Area chamber to find a solution.
''Obviously, we don't want to ruin their fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   If a compromise isn't found, the catfish fry will be canceled
and cost the chamber $5,000 in fish ready for the grill. Barbara
Conner, chamber executive director, said that problem was minor
compared with the fires that have charred parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have homes in the state that are no longer there because of
the fires. We totally understand. We'll come up with something,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some parts of Oklahoma haven't seen rain in two months. The
drought, high temperatures and low humidity, have turned brush into
kindling. More than 100,000 acres have burned and 60 homes have
been damaged or destroyed. Firefighters are still at work to
contain more than 100 blazes.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state officials expressed optimism Friday that they
were bringing most of the major fires under control, but the
weather forecast held little hope of soaking rains to end the
drought and extreme fire danger, although there was a chance of
rain and cooler temperatures through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of U.S. 77 near Turner Falls was closed Friday
afternoon as crews working in the Arbuckle Mountains dealt with hot
spots. The fire has burned there for a week and consumed more than
10,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Police are issuing tickets for those who violate the burn ban.
Two citations were issued by Oklahoma City police on Friday to
motorists who tossed burning cigarettes out car windows. A man
burning trash, with flames leaping three feet in the air, also was
cited, even though he was standing over the fire with a garden
hose.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded ban also was expected to put a damper on tailgate
parties at football games at the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma
State University and the University of Tulsa.

Wen Ho Lee Supporters Seek Pardon

   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Wen Ho Lee's supporters are seeking a presidential
pardon for the Los Alamos scientist who was freed last week in a plea agreement.
Lee, 60, pleaded guilty Sept. 13 to one of 59 counts against him. The other 58
were dropped in a negotiated settlement of the nine-month national security
prosecution that had kept him in solitary confinement. Cecilia Chang of the Wen
Ho Lee Defense Fund in Fremont, Calif., sent out a thank-you note Friday to Lee
supporters expressing joy that he was released and sadness that he had to plead
guilty and lose such citizenship rights as being able to vote. Only a
presidential pardon could restore those rights.

E-Mails Detail Gore Buddhist Visit

   BERLIN (AP) -- The guardians of the world's most powerful currencies teamed
up Friday to help the beleaguered euro. The intervention by European Central
Bank, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan had the desired effect,
pushing the currency briefly up more than 5 percent. But as the euro fell off
its quick gains, experts said the lasting effects of the unprecedented move

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, hosted 404

White House said today. Collectively they gave $624,000 to the first lady's
Senate campaign, according to an analysis by a watchdog group. The guest list
was released in the face of accusations that Mrs. Clinton rewarded donors with
sleepovers since she began her Senate campaign. Roughly one in four of the

<HEADLINE> Peru Moves To Disband Spy Agency  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori's government sent
Congress urgent legislation Friday to disband his now-disgraced spy
agency after opening talks with the opposition on holding new
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The dismantling of the National Intelligence Service was a key
demand of the opposition, who also warned Friday that the talks
with Fujimori would be damaged unless he arrests the agency's
powerful former chief, implicated recently in a bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's session, the government and opposition agreed that
Fujimori would formalize the removal of spy chief Vladimiro
Montesinos from his post by Monday, the mediator said. Official
confirmation that Montesinos was out had been another top
opposition demand.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord, Fujimori will put out an executive resolution
that certifies Montesinos ''no longer exercises any function, duty
or responsibility of any kind for the state,'' said Eduardo
Latorre, the mediator from the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Montesinos -- once Fujimori's most trusted aide but ousted
after a video apparently showed him bribing a politician -- may
wield enough power within the courts and the military to fight on
and avoid prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape prompted Fujimori's stunning Sept. 16 announcement
that he would deactivate Montesinos' intelligence service and call
new elections in which he would not be a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to disband the spy agency, Fujimori's government sent
Congress a package that called for scrapping the nationwide network
of agents and informants within a 15-day period of its passage. The
Congress, where Fujimori supporters hold a majority, was expected
to quickly consider the measure.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the proposal praised the agency, known by its Spanish
acronym SIN, for helping defeat leftist insurgencies and keeping
the peace with regional neighbors. It called for a commission made
up of the country's prime minister and interior and defense
ministries to oversee the dismantling of the agency, which it said
would bring ''benefits'' as a cost-cutting move.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos' name was nowhere mentioned in the two-page document.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said it would take months to disband the agency,
and the proposal did not elaborate on how it would be carried out.
It comes after days of protest by the opposition that Fujimori show
proof he was making good on his pledge to take apart the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS-mediated talks are part of an internationally backed
effort to strengthen Peru's democracy after Fujimori's much
criticized re-election in May. Friday's session discussed the
transition to the new elections called by Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition leaders said official confirmation of Montesinos'
ouster and his prosecution by an independent judiciary were
necessary for the dialogue to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''This must inevitably begin with a resolution separating
Montesinos from any public function,'' said Alejandro Toledo, the
opposition leader who boycotted a May presidential runoff with
Fujimori, claiming his government planned to rig the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's military, widely viewed to be allied with Montesinos, on
Thursday issued a communique backing Fujimori's call for new
elections and SIN's dismantlement. That came after days of ominous
silence, calming fears that Montesinos was organizing a coup.
</P>
<P>
   Government critics and analysts said the 54-year-old Montesinos
would wage his counteroffensive through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Belaunde, president of the Lima Bar Association, said
Peru's provisional Supreme Court Judge Alejandro Rodriguez Medrano
and Attorney General Blanca Nelida Colan ''are open instruments of
Montesinos, there to follow orders.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that this week Colan pushed aside a permanent prosecutor
initially appointed to investigate Montesinos, reportedly because
she favored seeking the spy chief's arrest, and replaced her with
one viewed as more pliant.
</P>
<P>
   The critics say that in the last eight years Colan has shelved
investigations of Montesinos' reportedly vast personal wealth and
ignored accusations that he took payoffs from a convicted drug
dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez Medrano and Colan did not return The Associated Press'
phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Many doubt Peru's judiciary is up to the task of judging
Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   ''There could never be a free trial,'' said constitutional
expert Javier Valle Riestra, a former prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Buffalo Union Leaders Plead Guilty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Three leaders of the Buffalo teachers union
pleaded guilty Friday to violating a judge's order barring them
from calling a strike.
</P>
<P>
   President Philip Rumore, vice president Edith LeWin and
secretary Barbara Bielecki could get up to 30 days in jail and
$1,000 in fines at sentencing Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers in the 47,000-student district walked off the job Sept.
7 and again Sept. 14 before returning to work under pressure from a
judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We broke the law, we know that,'' Rumore said. ''As teachers
and officers of the BTF, we wanted to take responsibility for our
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial's resolution came hours before the anticipated end of
the labor dispute that led to the walkouts.
</P>
<P>
   Rank-and-file members of the union overwhelmingly approved the
five-year contract recommended by a state mediator. Of the roughly
2,800 teachers who voted, Rumore said ''maybe 25 to 30'' opposed
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education appoved the plan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal provides no raises in the first year and a raise of
up to 2 percent every six months after that for the next four
years.

<HEADLINE> Reno, Clinton Talk About Lee Case  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a private meeting with President Clinton
to patch up their differences over the Wen Ho Lee case, Attorney
General Janet Reno ordered an internal review of Justice Department
actions in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The White House session came the week after a rare public
disagreement, in which Clinton said the nuclear weapons scientist's
long detention ''just can't be justified.'' Reno has refused to
apologize to Lee or otherwise take blame for what the federal judge
in the case called Lee's shameful pretrial detention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Reno agreed that prosecutors' first priority should
be finding out what happened to sensitive weapons information Lee
has admitted mishandling, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
after the 45-minute meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''They both agreed that the most important thing we can do is to
try to get to the bottom of this, and that process continues,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the internal Office of Professional Responsibility
would look at the case. That office routinely reviews cases like
this one, in which a federal judge criticizes government action.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Justice official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the internal review would start with criticisms made by U.S.
District Judge James Parker and would encompass the whole handling
of the case by the Justice Department and the FBI, including Reno's
role.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Reno released a toughly worded statement
defending prosecutors, and noted that she and FBI Director Louis
Freeh will testify in Congress on the Lee case next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our case against Dr. Lee was critical for national security,''
Reno said. ''Dr. Lee downloaded nuclear secrets onto unsecured
computer tapes and offered no explanation as to why. The United
States has an obligation to find out what happened to the
information on those tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lee supporters said Friday they are seeking a
presidential pardon. ''So where do we go from here?'' Cecilia Chang
of the Wen Ho Lee Defense Fund in Fremont, Calif., wrote in a note
to supporters. ''First and foremost, we are seeking a presidential
pardon from President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Elliot Diringer declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, born in Taiwan, was initially an espionage suspect -- the
target of a federal probe into how China may have obtained
classified nuclear warhead blueprints. Prosecutors eventually
charged him only with mishandling nuclear data, and held him for
nine months.
</P>
<P>
   In what amounted to a collapse of the government's case,
prosecutors agreed to a plea bargain last week in which Lee pleaded
guilty to one of 59 counts. Lee walked free Sept. 13, sentenced to
the time he had already served awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Parker blistered the Energy and Justice departments in court
last week, and apologized to Lee. The judge said he had been misled
about the danger Lee might pose if released on bail before trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have embarrassed our entire nation and each of us who is
a citizen of it,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton ''expressed strong support for the
attorney general'' during Friday's meeting, a far cry from the
tongue-lashing Clinton's comments last week seemed to presage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton requested the Reno meeting a day after his strong
remarks on the Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who met with Justice officials at the White House
before Lee's indictment last Dec. 10, said he found it difficult in
retrospect to reconcile how the government could ''keep someone in
jail without bail, argue right up to the 11th hour that they're a
terrible risk, and then turn around and make that sort of plea
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   While he stopped short of siding entirely with Parker, Clinton
added: ''I too am quite troubled by it.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Czar To Move Headquarters  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS ROBERTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Slowing the flood of illegal drugs across
the southwest border into the United States will be easier if
anti-drug groups are coordinated from a new El Paso headquarters,
according to drug czar Barry McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey visited with Mexican officials and toured a
drug-treatment clinic across the border in Juarez on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Texas is a huge piece of a drug-smuggling route
between Mexico and the United States, McCaffrey said he is moving
the headquarters of the Southwest Border High Intensity Drug
Trafficking Areas program from San Diego to El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   The program operated on a budget of $46 million this year and
covers 2,000 miles of border between the United States and Mexico.
It focuses on specific counties in California, Arizona, New Mexico
and Texas that have known drug-smuggling routes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's generally understood that this area is, and has been, a
major artery for narcotics smuggling in the United States,'' said
Border Patrol spokesman Doug Mosier. ''It's a valuable, strategic
idea to focus on this area as the headquarters for this
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said another reason for the move is to put the
program's headquarters close to other El Paso-based anti-drug
groups such as the Drug Enforcement Administration's El Paso
Intelligence Center, which tracks Mexican drug gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Other agencies already located in El Paso coordinate military
responses to drug trafficking and private-sector resources.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said five regional offices -- one in each border state
except Texas, which has two -- had been operating somewhat
independently to deal with ''nuances'' of the drug trade in each
region.
</P>
<P>
   Those five offices will become state advisory boards that answer
to an El Paso-based executive committee, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the years, they have increasingly seen themselves as
separate entities and there's a little turf-consciousness there,''
he said, adding that the centralization will increase efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said the executive committee will be formed soon and
will have about two months to come up with a plan to implement his
directive.
</P>
<P>
   In High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas nationwide -- there are
31 in the United States -- local, state, federal and military
law-enforcement agencies work on projects to oppose illegal drug
use and distribution. The program started in 1990 with a federal
investment of $25 million shared among five regions. Federal
funding is more than $190 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said a bill is pending in Congress that would increase
funding for 2001 to $206 million.

<HEADLINE> No deal reached between Clinton, Lazio on soft money in N.Y. Senate race </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAYUGA HEIGHTS, N.Y. (AP) - No agreement was reached Friday
between New York's Senate candidates on soft money, although
earlier in the day Rep. Rick Lazio believed first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton had agreed to a ban.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he thought from remarks Clinton made on Friday
morning that she had agreed to his proposal to ban all groups from
spending soft money. But Clinton had only offered a deal that
pertained to political parties, and not unions and other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   After Lazio announced the pact during a campaign stop outside a
defense contractor's plant in Kirkwood, calling it a ''historic''
agreement, Clinton's campaign immediately rejected the contention.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign released a letter from Lazio campaign manager Bill
Dal Col, dated Thursday, that said, ''We have dropped our
precondition that you attain the signatures of the outside interest
groups supporting your campaign.'' On Friday, however, the Lazio
campaign said the ''agreement'' covered such groups and Dal Col
sent a letter to Clinton aides saying he expected all soft-money
ads to be pulled by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offer said soft money ads already paid for would run
into next week.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has made soft-money spending a major issue for more than a
month. He had insisted that outside groups supporting Clinton, such
as the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League and
the AFL-CIO, also abide by the pact.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, head of the AFL-CIO, has said he would not go
along with a soft-money ban.
</P>
<P>
   In her offer Friday, Clinton said she would urge political
parties backing her not to buy any more issue ads on radio and TV
if Lazio did the same. She also wants groups closely associated
with the Republican and Conservative parties to agree to the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Hard money contributions are limited to $2,000 per donor. There
is no limit on soft money contributions; they can be used to
advocate an issue, boost one candidate or attack an opposing
candidate, but such ads cannot conclude by asking voters to choose
a particular candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign has already raised millions of dollars in
soft money; Lazio's campaign does not have its own soft-money
account but has benefited from soft-money spending by outside
groups.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Pres: We Can Resist Russia  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Chechnya's president said in an interview
published Friday that rebel forces were prepared to resist Russia
for another decade and he urged Russian forces to give up the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only new victims lie ahead,'' Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov told the Kommersant daily. ''The Russian army is a great
army, and its mission is to fight with superpowers. There is a need
to make sure that the Russian army is not shamed again.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia suffered a humiliating defeat in the 1994-96 Chechnya
war. Federal troops withdrew, giving Chechnya de facto
independence. Russian troops entered Chechnya nearly a year ago,
aiming to regain control of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov, branded a criminal and a terrorist by the Kremlin,
proposed that Russia begin talks with Chechen leaders and withdraw
its troops to avoid further casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are ready to resist for a day, a month, a year, or 10
years, if need be,'' Maskhadov was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   But Akhmad Kadyrov, the head of the pro-Russian civilian
administration in Chechnya, said Maskhadov spoke only for himself
and had no influence over other guerrilla commanders.
</P>
<P>
   He said a court of religious officials in mostly Muslim Chechnya
had ruled that the war against Russia was not a holy war and
decided ''to consider Maskhadov the main guilty party for the
war... and the genocide of the Chechen people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin's chief spokesman on Chechnya,
said that Moscow was determined to stamp out the rebels and that
the government would only negotiate Maskhadov's surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov's refusal to surrender was responsible for continuing
Chechen casualties, Yastrzhembsky said.

<HEADLINE> EU Details World Crises Plans  </HEADLINE>
By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ECOUEN, France (AP) -- Defense ministers from the European Union
on Friday detailed the number of planes, ships and troops a
proposed EU defense force would need to ensure it can tackle world
crises.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 member states are expected to announce the resources each
will commit to a rapid reaction force of between 50,000 and 60,000
troops, able to deploy within 60 days and sustain itself for a
year. The corps is due to be operational by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The new force will mean that the EU is able to take military
action when the United States does not want to get involved, a key
factor in promoting the bloc's credentials on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-hour meeting north of Paris, French Defense Minister
Alain Richard said ministers had approved a list of resources,
drawn up by the bloc's military experts.
</P>
<P>
   A supply of 80,000 soldiers will be needed for humanitarian
crises, rescue operations, peacekeeping and peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   About 350 planes and 80 ships will be required, Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each country will now be invited to give its answer ...
detailing the kind of units it will commit, their number or size,
their availability and the year we can expect this contribution,''
Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries have already put numbers on the table -- from
Germany's pledge of 18,000 troops to Belgium's commitment of 3,500
troops.
</P>
<P>
   The EU's decision to create the force is a political statement
as much as a military necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by Europe's failure to react swiftly or independently to
the Balkan crises, EU leaders decided last December to create the
force in order to be able to take action when the United States
does not want to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was at first greeted cautiously by Washington and some
European countries that are NATO members but not part of the EU.
There were fears the new force might cause the EU to drift away
from the alliance and adopt a go-it-alone strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But Javier Solana, the EU's foreign and security policy chief,
and a former NATO secretary-general, said such concerns had
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the (NATO) countries are now very relaxed, they have the
same point of view and are on the same wave length,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> FCC Affirms Low-Power Radio Plan  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators affirmed a plan Friday to
license hundreds of new low-power radio stations, making only minor
changes such as adding safeguards to protect radio reading services
for the blind from interference.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission largely ignored the
complaints of commercial broadcasters, who say low-power service
will interfere with existing FM stations. The FCC is close to
awarding its first batch of low-power licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have always been confident that LPFM can be implemented
without disturbing the integrity of the FM service,'' said FCC
Chairman William Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has come under fierce attack on Capitol Hill, where
many lawmakers have moved legislation to curtail or eliminate the
FCC's plan altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But in Friday's decision, the commission reiterated its view
that the risk from interference by the low-power radio stations --
operating at 10 and 100 watts -- would be small and therefore did
not require a larger buffer zone to protect full-power stations.
</P>
<P>
   By increasing protections, the FCC would be forced to decrease
the number of low-power stations it could authorize.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC did, however, respond to concerns raised by National
Public Radio and others that the low-power stations would harm
so-called reading services for the blind and visually impaired.
Such services, which allow for books or other text to be narrated,
are carried on subcarrier channels.
</P>
<P>
   The commission adopted additional protections for those FM
stations that operate radio reading services, requiring more space
between them and the microradio channels.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of NPR's members air reading services for the
blind on subcarrier channels. NPR said it would review the details
of the changes made by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''NPR's position from day one has been that we believe that
public radio and low power FM can coexist in the future as
complementary services,'' said NPR spokeswoman Siriol Evans. ''From
the very beginning, we have emphasized the importance of
safeguarding radio reading services for the blind and translator
stations that provide programming to remote rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC, while not adding protections for commercial
broadcasters at large, did agree to institute a new interference
complaint procedure. The process would be triggered when a
full-power FM radio station receives complaints from 1 percent of
its listeners in the area likely to experience interference.
</P>
<P>
   Commission field agents would be available to assist low-power
and commercial broadcasters in their attempts to address the
interference. If a solution is not reached, the FCC will take up a
review that it must complete within three months.
</P>
<P>
   National Association of Broadcasters spokesman Dennis Wharton
said the group did not have a chance to review the decision yet,
but ''we already know the FCC plan will allow additional
interference for listeners.''
</P>
<P>
   FCC Commissioner Michael Powell, backing some of the
commission's decision, continued to raise concerns that low-power
stations could threaten the economic viability of small broadcast
stations.

<HEADLINE> Oil Release Swap Plan  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Energy Department is releasing 30 million barrels
of oil
from the government's emergency reserve. Here is how the release,
technically called a ''swap,'' will work.
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Bids for the oil will be solicited Sept. 25, offering 30
million barrels in exchange for a future amount of oil. The bids
must be in by Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   --The department negotiates and selects the best bids, those that
provide the best return for the government in the form of
additional future oil and other factors. Successful bids will be
announced Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   --Winning bidders must arrange for transportation and must take
the oil during the month of November.
</P>
<P>
   --The oil will come from three Strategic Petroleum Reserve
repositories on the Gulf Coast. Each repository is capable of
delivering between 500,000 and 1 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   --Winning bidders must return a like amount of oil, plus a
premium amount to be negotiated, to the government reserve at some
time during 2001, when markets are expected to be less tight and
prices lower.
</P>
<P>
   No money will exchange hands because the winning bidders
essentially will ''borrow'' the oil from the government and sell it
in the marketplace at current prices.
</P>
<P>
   The companies will make a profit because -- assuming prices will
go down -- the oil they return to the reserve will be less valuable
than the oil they took out and sold. The government, in turn, will
obtain additional ''bonus'' oil resulting in an increase of the
reserve's current 571 million-barrel inventory.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Announces Tax Breaks  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN W. GRAHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder announced tax breaks
for commuters and subsidies to Germany's poor, hit by skyrocketing
fuel prices, his government's first concessions since protests
erupted across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While targeting relief at Germans who drive to work, people on
welfare and students, Schroeder gave no ground on the central
demand of truckers, taxi drivers, farmers and opposition parties:
slashing fuel taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the responsibility to help those who can't cope on
their own,'' Finance Minister Hans Eichel said after an emergency
meeting of Schroeder's Cabinet agreed on the $1.5 billion package.
</P>
<P>
   The government has held out against cuts in fuel taxes that make
up more than half the pump price paid by motorists and truckers,
instead blaming oil-producing nations and oil companies for the
recent jump in prices for gas, diesel and heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to ease the discontent of the country's strong auto
lobby, Eichel said the government would raise a tax break currently
available to commuters who drive to work to 59 cents per mile up
from 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage commuters to use buses, trains or bicycles to work,
even those trips will be tax deductible under the new measures.
</P>
<P>
   Low-income residents, meanwhile, will receive a one-time heating
subsidy of 21 cents per square foot of gas before the end of the
winter, Eichel said.
</P>
<P>
   The measures require approval by the lower house of parliament,
where Schroeder's center-left government of Social Democrats and
Greens hold the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties blasted the relief as insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, fishermen and farmers launched a fourth day of
protests against fuel prices Friday, preventing refueling at a
southern port, snarling traffic in Cordoba and blocking fuel
distribution centers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the protests, the government said it will not give in to
demands to eliminate fuel taxes. Agriculture Minister Miguel Arias
Canete the cash value of measures already offered by the government
exceed any possible fuel tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel protests, which have paralyzed many highways, ports and
fuel depots this month as they move across the continent, began in
France and then spread to other EU nations, most recently Spain.
</P>
<P>
   But while France bowed to some trucker demands and granted tax
rebates, Germany, Britain and Spain have refused to lower fuel
taxes.

<HEADLINE> Suharto Checks Into Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian ex-dictator Suharto checked
into a hospital Saturday for a court-ordered examination by an
independent medical team to determine if he is fit to stand trial
on massive corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Suharto looked healthy on arrival at Pertamina
Hospital and walked unaided before orderlies brought him a
wheelchair. He was accompanied by four of his children and several
bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's top lawyer, Juan Felix Tampubolon, said the 24-member
team of independent doctors had told him the examination may take
as long as two days.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 14, judges ordered Suharto, 79, undergo an independent
examination after he refused to attend two sessions of his
corruption trial on grounds of failing health.
</P>
<P>
   His doctors say three strokes have damaged Suharto's brain.
Government physicians maintain he is capable of facing court.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, who was ousted from office in 1998 amid pro-democracy
protests and riots, is charged with embezzling at least $583
million in government money to bankroll businesses controlled by
his cronies and children.
</P>
<P>
   The judges ordered the independent report be ready by the time
the court reconvenes on Sept. 28 and ordered Suharto to be present
for that session.

Yehuda Amichai
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Yehuda Amichai, who invented an Israeli poetic
language that blended the longings of the ancient Jewish poets and
the spare introspection of modern stylists, died Friday of cancer.
He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote in Hebrew and was probably Israel's most translated
poet.
</P>
<P>
   Amichai was perpetually nominated for the Nobel literature
prize. His poetry celebrated the return of the Jews to their
ancient homeland -- he was born in Wuerzburg, Germany, in 1924, and
came to Israel as a refugee from Nazi persecution in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   His first collection of poetry, ''Now and in Other Days,'' was
published in 1955, and precipitated a radical, slangy departure
from the formal style of other modern Hebrew poets.
</P>
<P>
Anne E. Dyson
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Dr. Anne E. Dyson, a pediatrician,
philanthropist and well-known children's advocate, died Thursday
after battling breast cancer. She was 52.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson, wife of Michael Kramer, managing editor of the New York
Daily News, headed the Dyson Foundation, which has financed many
programs aimed at improving the lives of children in New York's
Mid-Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation -- among the nation's largest, with assets of more
than $330 million -- was founded in 1957 by her late parents,
Charles and Margaret Dyson.
</P>
<P>
   Besides heading the foundation, Dyson was co-chairwoman of the
Partnership for Children of the American Academy of Pediatrics. She
also was vice chairwoman of the board of overseers of the Joan and
Sanford I. Weill Medical College and Graduate School of Medical
Sciences of Cornell University.

Warren Rutledge
</P>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Warren Rutledge, one of the winningest high
school basketball coaches in the country, died Thursday after a
stroke. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge had 949 victories in 43 years at Benedictine High
School.
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge retired last season after leading Benedictine to the
state Catholic championship for the 26th time. He finished with a
949-334 record -- the highest victory total in state prep history
and seventh in the nation, according to the National High School
Sports Record Book.
</P>
<P>
John Sutherland Egerton
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- John Sutherland Egerton, the sixth Duke of
Sutherland and owner of one of the great private collections of Old
Master paintings, died Thursday after a brief illness. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   The duke inherited some 500 paintings and drawings, most
purchased from the French royal collection of Louis Philippe, Duke
of Orleans, after the French Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most important works in the National Gallery of
Scotland are on loan from the duke, including three Raphaels, five
Titians, a Tintoretto and a group of Poussin's works.
</P>
<P>
   Egerton succeeded his father in 1944 as fifth Earl of Ellesmere,
then inherited the dukedom of Sutherland in 1963 when his cousin
the fifth Duke of Sutherland died without a male heir.
</P>
<P>
   He served with the British Expeditionary Force in France during
World War II, was captured in 1940 and spent five years in a German
prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   There were no children from either of the Duke's two marriages,
and the duke's heir is a cousin, Francis Ronald Egerton.
</P>
<P>
Irwin W. Sizer
</P>
<P>
   BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- Irwin W. Sizer, a former dean and
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died Sept.
11. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Sizer began his 60-year career with MIT when he became head of
the university's biology department in 1957. He shepherded the
department into focusing on molecular biology, and became dean of
the university's graduate school in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   During Sizer's tenure as dean, MIT developed a joint doctorate
program between MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
In 1974, he co-founded MIT's Whitaker College, which offers joint
doctorate programs with Harvard, Tufts and Boston University
medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he and his late wife Helen, who died in 1997, endowed
the Helen and Irwin Sizer Career Development Professorship at MIT.

Richard L. Watson Jr.
</P>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. - Richard L. Watson, Jr., a retired Duke University
history professor who served in World War II and then helped write
a comprehensive history of the Air Force in the war, died Friday of
pneumonia. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Watson arrived at Duke in 1939 and never left except for five
years of military service.
</P>
<P>
   He was drafted into the Army in 1941 and was assigned to the Air
Historical Office Headquarters from 1943 to 1946.
</P>
<P>
   After his return to campus, he and fellow Duke history professor
Arthur Ferguson worked on a seven-volume history of the Air Force
during the war. The first volume in the series was published in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   Watson was chairman of the university's history department from
1960 to 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He was author of five books and dozens of scholarly articles.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Cops Address Training  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN K. PAULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Officers followed their training when they waited
for SWAT teams to pursue the gunmen at Columbine High School, but
their training may have been flawed, a sheriff's commander said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Division Chief John Kiekbusch said his department
changed its training and deputies are now being taught to respond
to situations like Columbine by going after an attacker rather than
waiting for help.
</P>
<P>
   ''One major change in law enforcement is recognizing you can't
always wait for the SWAT team,'' Kiekbusch told about 100 educators
and police officers at a conference on school crises.
</P>
<P>
   Victims' families sued the sheriff's office over its handling of
Columbine, claiming among other things that commanders waited too
long to intervene. The department said officers did all they could
to stop the carnage by evacuating students from the building.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and a teacher
at Columbine before killing themselves April 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Kiekbusch, who led the sheriff's investigation into the
shooting, is a defendant in some of the suits.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff John Stone was scheduled to address the panel Friday but
backed out after questions were raised about his participation. The
sheriff has refused to talk to the Governor's Columbine Review
Commission about how the department handled the crisis, citing the
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Kiekbusch said he is willing to talk about the shootings because
he already has testified before the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have nothing to hide. The information we're presenting has
been out there for quite some time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Jim Rouse, who filed a lawsuit for some Columbine
victims, said the sheriff's department previously has refused to
acknowledge any problems with training.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Cuba pulled into second place in the
Group A standings of men's Olympic volleyball by defeating
Australia 25-17, 25-20, 25-18.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba is even with the Netherlands at 3-1, but since the Dutch
dropped a set to last-place Egypt earlier, Cuba gained a slight
edge in the tiebreakers.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba and the Netherlands have won nine games and lost four, and
the next tiebreaker is points won versus lost. Cuba, with the best
all-around offense in the tournament, has a better ratio in that
department.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 seed from Group A likely gets to avoid Russia until
the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Dennis had 12 kills for the Cubans on Saturday (Friday
night EDT), who struggled early against the psyched-up host
country.
</P>
<P>
   Australia got within 19-17, but Cuba started hitting everything
and scored the last six points to take the first game.
</P>
<P>
   Australia prolonged the match by saving four match points at the
end. But Dennis slammed a ball so hard it bounced off a blocker,
ricocheted off a padded wall 10 feet away and rolled back to the
court.

<HEADLINE> Tough Day for U.S. At the Track  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Lance Deal, the grand old man of U.S.
hammer throwing, ended his Olympic career with a disappointing
performance -- and the rest of the American team also struggled at
the track Saturday (Friday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Deal and the other two Americans in the hammer, Jud Logan and
Kevin McMahon, all failed to advance out of the qualifying round.
Deal, silver medalist at the 1996 Atlanta Games and a four-time
Olympian, said it was his next-to-last competition -- he'll retire
after the Grand Prix Finals in Qatar next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone asked to take my picture out there and told me to
smile. It's hard to force a smile when you feel like crying,'' said
the 39-year-old Deal.
</P>
<P>
   Deal was 16th in the qualifying round. McMahon was 36th and
Logan was 39th. Only the top 12 advanced to Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
   All three American men in the 800 meters -- Mark Everett, Bryan
Woodward and Richard Kenah -- also flopped in Saturday's first
round.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't feel great. I didn't run good. It's a bad time to run
a bad race,'' said Woodward, who was 23rd fastest in the qualifying
heats but tops among the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Borzakovsky had the best time of 1 minute, 45.39 seconds in
the first round of the 800 and Wilson Kipketer was second fastest
at 1:45.57. The semifinals are Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And when the women's heptathlon began Saturday with the
100-meter hurdles and high jump, Kelly Blair-LaBounty was not
there. She had left Sydney and flown home to Seattle, where her
husband plays for the Seahawks, because of continuing problems with
a spinal disc injury that has bothered her all year.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night promised to be better for the Americans, with
Marion Jones and Maurice Greene both favored for gold in the 100
meters.
</P>
<P>
   The sport's biggest stars put on a show as track and field began
at the Sydney Olympics on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones ran into the semifinals of the women's 100 with a time of
10.83 seconds, the second-fastest clocking in the world this year.
Michael Johnson and Cathy Freeman both had easy wins in first-round
heats of the 400.
</P>
<P>
   And there were some unlikely stars. Arsi Harju of Finland won
the men's shot put and Robert Korzeniowski of Poland got gold in
the men's 20-kilometer walk despite not crossing the finish line
first.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, the world record holder and Olympic favorite, raced into
the semifinals with a time of 10.10 in the second heat. His Sydney
housemate and training partner Ato Boldon will join him in the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Also advancing were Americans Jon Drummond and Curtis Johnson.
But defending champion Donovan Bailey, who spent the past few days
battling the flu, ran out of steam in his second-round heat and was
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I shouldn't have run,'' Bailey said. ''But I've never been one
to back down, and I'll go out fighting. This is the Olympic Games.
This is the ultimate ultimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Jones in the semifinals of the women's 100 was U.S.
teammate Chryste Gaines. Torri Edwards, a late replacement for the
injured Inger Miller, was fifth in her second-round heat and failed
to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Also reaching the semifinals was Merlene Ottey, a seven-time
Olympic medalist who substituted at the last minute for teammate
Peta-Gaye Dowdie -- leading to protests by some Jamaican team
members.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, seeking to become the first Aborigine to win an
individual Olympic gold medal, received thunderous applause from
her fellow Australians in the 110,000-seat Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman won her heat in 51.63 seconds. She has not lost a
400-meter race in three years and is even more of a favorite at the
Sydney Games now that two-time defending champion Marie-Jose Perec
has fled the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Harju won the shot with a toss of 69 feet, 10&AMP;frac14; inches. The other
two medals were taken by Americans -- Adam Nelson was second with a
throw of 69-7 and 1996 silver medalist John Godina won bronze with
69-6&AMP;frac34;.
</P>
<P>
   Godina was a late replacement for U.S. teammate C.J. Hunter, the
reigning world champion. Hunter dropped out after arthroscopic knee
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The first track medal of the games was mired in controversy.
Mexico's Bernardo Segura crossed the finish line first in the
20-kilometer walk, but was disqualified for breaking contact with
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the gold medal to Korzeniowski, with Noe Hernandez of
Mexico second and Vladimir Andreyev of Russia third.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's high jump, defending champion Charles Austin failed
to advance out of the qualifying round. But 1992 Olympic champ
Javier Sotomayor, who returned to competition in mid-August after
track and field officials cut in half a two-year ban for cocaine
use, reached the high jump final.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 9, Yankees 6  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Yankees keep trying to play themselves back
into a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Nomo matched his season high with nine strikeouts and
Deivi Cruz drove in three runs as the Detroit Tigers sent New York
to its first six-game losing streak in three years, beating the
Yankees 9-6 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, New York held a nine-game lead in the AL East, the
division race seemingly over. But the Yankees have lost eight of
nine since then, getting outscored 69-25.
</P>
<P>
   New York's division lead remained at 4&AMP;frac12; games over second-place
Toronto only because Tampa Bay beat the Blue Jays 3-2, lowering the
Yankees' magic number to six
</P>
<P>
   The two-time defending World Series champions, who last lost six
straight to Philadelphia and Baltimore from Sept. 1-6, 1997,
haven't even led in 54 consecutive innings.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez is in an 0-for-28 slump, Jorge Posada is 4-for-25
with 11 strikeouts and Chuck Knoblauch is 4-for-28.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill, back in the lineup after a week off to allow his
injured right hip to heal, struck out four times, three against
Nomo (8-11). Nomo allowed three runs and four hits in six-plus
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Only Derek Jeter, who matched his career high by going 4-for-5,
and David Justice, who drove in three runs, seem immune to the
slump.
</P>
<P>
   After Cruz's two-run homer put the Tigers ahead in the fifth,
Justice hit a two-run single in the bottom half -- the first time
the Yankees scored multiple runs in 43 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, 7-2 against the Yankees this year, quickly came back in
the sixth against Denny Neagle (7-6). Damion Easley reached on a
bunt single and took third on Bobby Higginson's one-out single,
straining his left quadriceps on his slide.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle walked Dean Palmer, then threw a wild pitch behind Billy
McMillon's head, allowing the go-ahead run to score.
</P>
<P>
   McMillon walked, finishing Neagle, and Cruz blooped Jason
Grimsley's first pitch just over second baseman Jose Vizcaino and
in front of Bernie Williams in center, making it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Rich Becker had an RBI grounder and Hal Morris hit
an opposite-field pop to left that seemed catchable but fell beyond
the reach of Justice as two more runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at Yankee Stadium, used to excellence, booed as the
Yankees slowly returned to their dugout after the inning.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill hit a sacrifice fly in the seventh off C.J. Nitkowski,
and Williams singled in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Jeff Nelson was booed after getting over to first too
late on a ninth-inning grounder. He was immediately replaced by Ted
Lilly, who threw a run-scoring wild pitch, then failed to get over
in time on another grounder, which Martinez threw away for a
run-scoring error. Yankees manager Joe Torre then took out Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Anderson allowed an RBI double to Williams and a
run-scoring single to Justice in the ninth before Todd Jones struck
out Posada for his league-leading 41st save in 44 chances.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Before the fifth, the Yankees' previous multirun inning was
a four-run seventh in Sunday's 15-4 loss to Cleveland. New York
trailed 15-0 at the time. ... Before Justice's hit, Yankees'
left-handed hitters were 0-for-10 against Nomo. ... Nomo also
struck out nine against the White Sox on April 30. ... Cruz's homer
was his second in five career at-bats against Neagle. ... Neagle
allowed six runs, four hits and four walks in 5 1-3 innings. ...
Easley left in the middle of the sixth. His replacement, Jose
Macias, made a diving stop behind second against Posada on a
grounder that ended the seventh. ... Detroit has won the season
series from New York for the first time since 1991 (8-5).

<HEADLINE> E-Mails Detail Gore Buddhist Visit  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's staff described an
event he attended at a Buddhist temple as a fund-raiser, and an
e-mail suggested he bring $20 as ''an offering,'' according to
reconstructed White House computer messages belatedly turned over
to Congress on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The long-missing messages, provided to the House Government
Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., also show
that Gore's office was informed of an offer from a businessman to
raise $250,000 if a White House coffee were arranged with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The newly disclosed e-mails further support the assertion of
Gore's political opponents that the temple event and the coffees,
21 of which had the vice president as host, were fund-raising
events. The White House has always denied that they were
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Jim Kennedy said the material in the e-mails
contains ''nothing of significance.'' Kennedy added that the Gore
staffer who referred to the temple event as a fund-raiser was
questioned about it in Congress three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing in this material that sheds any new light on
this old debate,'' said Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the newly disclosed
e-mail material is ''yet another piece of evidence that calls into
question the vice president's credibility when he says he didn't
know that a fund-raising event was a fund-raising event.''
</P>
<P>
   The messages are some of more than 100,000 e-mails the White
House never properly archived. As a result, they weren't reviewed
to determine whether they should have been sent under subpoena to
investigators on topics ranging from fund raising to Whitewater and
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   They were reconstructed recently from backup tapes and are being
turned over to Congress. They were provided this summer to
Independent Counsel Robert Ray and the Justice Department, which
had subpoenaed them.
</P>
<P>
   One e-mail urged the vice president to take $20 on the trip to
the Buddhist temple in California. ''The VP will need to have some
cash on hand (Ladon recommended $20) to offer as an offering at the
Buddhist temple in LA,'' the message said. ''Ladon'' is a
misspelling and refers to Manteghi Ladan, a Gore scheduler, Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mails show the Gore staff considered the April 1996 event
at the Hsi Lai Buddhist temple near Los Angeles a fund-raiser. Gore
originally claimed it was a community outreach. He later said he
knew it was ''donor-related.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Currently, we are committed in San Jose and LA for
fund-raising events,'' said one staff e-mail on April 9, 1996,
three weeks before the event. That message included a draft
official schedule for two fund-raisers that day -- one at the temple
and one in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Another message details an apparent offer from
Taiwanese-American businessman George Chang in Virginia to raise
$250,000 if the Democratic National Committee would arrange his
request for a White House coffee and a Clinton interview with a
Taiwanese reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign said the material about the $250,000 was
turned over to Capitol Hill more than three years ago. ''It is old
and was reviewed at the time,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The offer of $250,000 came through Democratic fund-raiser John
Huang, a key figure in the 1996 political money controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chang is trying to arrange a POTUS coffee through the DNC, as
well as a POTUS interview with a Taiwanese reporter,'' a vice
presidential staffer wrote in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''In return for the DNC's efforts, Chang has promised to raise
$250,000,'' the message added. ''John feels there is a chance Chang
has overpromised, but he plans to keep working with him.''
</P>
<P>
   POTUS is the Secret Service's identifier for President of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The half-inch thick stack of messages was reconstructed from
Gore's office and contains several e-mails that conflict with the
White House's original explanations that the Buddhist temple event
and White House coffees weren't fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message in April 1996, one Gore staffer raised a
question about a White House coffee planned that month. ''I do not
remember asking, but I may have. These are FR coffees, right?''
</P>
<P>
   A White House official, speaking on condition, said they believe
the FR was a shorthand for ''fund-raising'' or ''finance-related.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the e-mails show Gore's staff sought a way to keep
the vice president's e-mails from a political adviser from being
archived by the White House system.
</P>
<P>
   ''All Internet e-mails are recorded on the White House
computers,'' an e-mail to Gore warned in 1996 when Gore's media
adviser Carter Eskew sought a way to send messages to the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way not to have your e-mails backed up on government
computers would be to get a Clinton-Gore computer in your office
and set it up for private e-mails,'' the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the e-mail demonstrates the vice president's office
thought the computer messages were being captured by the archiving
system, and the vice president's staff were being appropriately
cautious about how political e-mails would be handled.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Falls Apart in South  </HEADLINE>
By KEITH PARSONS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The remains of Tropical Storm Helene swept into
Georgia and South Carolina on Friday, falling apart after dumping
rain on the Florida Panhandle and spinning off several tornadoes.
Little damage was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Several inches of rain fell in Atlanta and flash flood watches
were out for much of Georgia and South Carolina. Scattered flooding
was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Several communties canceled high school football games Friday
night. However, outdoor events such as the Peanut Festival in Jimmy
Carter's hometown of Plains were still on.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going full steam ahead,'' said Plains Better Hometown
Coordinator Terri Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Helene's center made landfall with top winds near 45 mph at
about 8 a.m. near Fort Walton Beach, Fla. It was downgraded to a
tropical depression a few hours later and had moved into South
Carolina by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7 inches of rain caused minor flooding and power
outages in Tallahassee, while at least six tornadoes south of the
city caused no significant damage. Schools in the Florida Panhandle
and state offices in the capital had closed in anticipation of high
wind and heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''What storm?'' asked Charles Ingram, 62, a retired paper mill
worker, at breakfast at Linda's Restaurant in Port St. Joe, Fla.,
which got some of the heaviest rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an awful lot of water standing around, which we
need,'' Ingram said. ''It's just business as usual. We planned for
it, sandbagged and everything, but it didn't come.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina climatologist Mike Helfert said the storm was
moving fast enough that the state might escape serious flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm expecting that we'll get some good rains, but the duration
of those won't be as long as if she was a slower-moving storm,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The rain wasn't nearly enough to alleviate drought conditions in
parts of the South. The storm missed Alabama, one of the
hardest-hit areas in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''One rain won't change what's happened to us all year,'' said
Kris Balkcom, an assistant farm agent in Houston County, where the
peanut harvest is about one-third complete.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Psinakis, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey,
checks water gauges on Alabama's rivers and streams every six
weeks. He couldn't say how much rain would be needed to break the
drought cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will take a while to recover,'' Psinakis said. ''We're
going to need sustained rainfall, more than we're in right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The news was the same in Georgia, where the storm wasn't
expected to help farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will help some, particularly with the top soil moisture,''
said state climatologist David Stooksbury. ''But most of that rain
won't go into the soil, it'll just run off.''
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Isaac was in the far eastern Atlantic on Friday
and posed no threat to land. The storm, with maximum sustained
winds of nearly 50 mph, moving toward the west-northwest at nearly
18 mph.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Cone Could Be Heading To Pen  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- David Cone appears likely to make another start
Monday and could wind up in the New York Yankees' postseason
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, 0-2 since dislocating his left shoulder, threw in the
bullpen before Friday night's game against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to try to keep hope alive that I can still help this
team, somehow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone's next scheduled start is Monday against the Tigers -- the
Yankees' final scheduled home game of the regular season. Given
that Cone (4-13) is eligible for free agency and his future is
uncertain, it could be the final start in pinstripes at Yankee
Stadium for the 37-year-old right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to talk tomorrow,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said
after watching Cone throw. ''At times he threw a little tentative
and he admitted every few times it would grab him.''
</P>
<P>
   New York figures to use Roger Clemens (13-7), Andy Pettitte
(18-8), Orlando Hernandez (12-12) and Denny Neagle (7-6) as its
starters in the playoffs. Torre said he wouldn't hesitate to use
Cone as a right-handed long reliever out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly would like to have him if we get to the
postseason,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which has lost eight of nine, is just 9-19 in Cone's
starts this year. He wouldn't mind a relief role.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure, I'll do anything, anything they want at this point,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Against Toronto on Wednesday, he allowed seven runs and six hits
in 3 2-3 innings. In his first start after injuring his shoulder
Aug. 30 at Kansas City, he gave up six runs, eight hits and four
walks in 5 2-3 innings against Cleveland -- a potential postseason
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said it's hard to judge Cone's condition. The pitcher's
velocity has dropped since the injury, sustained when he caught a
popped-up bunt. No matter what decision the team makes, Cone will
agree to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coney, his mental approach is unlike anybody I've ever seen,''
the manager said. ''He's probably been the hardest guy to read but
the easiest guy to manage.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees acting pitching coach Billy Connors said Cone's
condition hadn't changed much in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   ''At times, he would feel it a little bit,'' Connors said.
''Other than that, it was all right.''

<HEADLINE> China Pandas' Arrival Delayed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two giant pandas will not be arriving from
China as soon as the National Zoo had hoped because of questions
federal officials have raised concerning financial and scientific
details of the 10-year, $10 million plan that will bring them here.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service plans to announce next week that
it will extend until late October the public comment period for the
zoo's import-permit application, The Washington Post reported on
its Web site Friday night. The period originally was scheduled to
close Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   China will lend the pandas to the zoo in return for $1 million a
year for 10 years. The pandas -- Mei Xiang, a 2-year-old female, and
Tian Tian, a 3-year-old male -- come from the Wolong reserve in
western China. Any offspring would become the property of China.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter late last month to National Zoo Director Lucy H.
Spelman, Kenneth Stansell, Fish and Wildlife's acting assistant
director of international affairs, said officials ''have a number
of continuing concerns regarding several substantive components of
the application.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief concern: whether the money going to China will promote
the survival of the panda in the wild, the central goal of U.S. and
international panda policy. Only about 1,000 pandas remain in
China's mountain forests.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wildlife Fund and the San Diego Zoo requested the
comment period's extension; the two groups said they share some of
Fish and Wildlife's concerns and want to hear the National Zoo's
reply before commenting further.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Spelman said she is confident the zoo will give
adequate replies to the agency's concerns and get the permit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are certain that we will come to an agreement with the Fish
and Wildlife Service on all of the issues before us, and we remain
confident that by year's end there will be two new pandas in the
National Zoo,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> UK Redgrave Extends Olympic legacy  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENRITH, Australia (AP) -- British rower Steven Redgrave was
already among the all-time great Olympic champions. Now he stands
at a level shared by only two others.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave led the Brits to victory Saturday (Friday night EDT) in
the men's coxless fours. It marked his fifth straight Olympics with
a gold medal, something done just twice before and never in a sport
as grueling as pulling a boat 2,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
   This victory was a feat in itself for someone who in the past
four years has been diagnosed with diabetes and undergone an
appendectomy. It also was special because the crew finished fourth
at a regatta this summer, drawing whispers that the 38-year-old
didn't have what it took any more.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had quite a tough road,'' said Redgrave, whose health is
closely monitored by the team's doctor -- his wife, Ann.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave moves into the five-in-a-row club with Hungarian
fencers Aladar Gerevich and Pal Kovacs.
</P>
<P>
   Gerevich won golds at the six games from 1932-60 and Kovacs won
five from '36-60; there were no games in '40 and '44 because of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no thought on it at all,'' Redgrave said with a sly
smile. ''I've been in it for the last four years to win this. Ask
me in a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the fours is somewhat of a return to Redgrave's roots.
His first gold was in the coxed fours in Los Angeles. Victories in
Seoul, Barcelona and Atlanta were in the coxless pairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a fantastic athlete,'' crewmate Tim Foster said. ''You
don't stay at the top that long without drive, determination,
talent and hard work. Rowing with him is tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Pinsent, Redgrave's partner for the last two golds,
joined him in this boat along with Foster and James Cracknell.
</P>
<P>
   Pinsent, Foster and Cracknell all raised their arms in victory
after crossing the finish. Redgrave was content just to stop
pulling.
</P>
<P>
   Pinsent walked back to his friend and they hugged, then Pinsent
-- who carried the British flag at the opening ceremonies, just as
Redgrave did at the two previous Olympics -- lost his balance and
wound up wet.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ''He might not be (rowing) in four years time. The way he moved
after the race, he'll be back in the gymnastics team,'' Redgrave
said.
</P>
<P>
   Once Pinsent got back in, the crew rowed over to the grandstand
to thank the crowd, many of whom waved British flags. Among their
supporters were member of their country's swim team, even though
they were racing in a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a tremendous British presence,'' said Redgrave, who
was angry that organizers tried rushing the team into the medals
ceremony rather than letting them celebrate and savor their
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   After winning in Atlanta, Redgrave looked into a television
camera and said: ''Anyone who sees me go anywhere near a boat
again, ever, you've got my permission to shoot me.''
</P>
<P>
   He played coy this time, saying ''you can assume what you want''
about Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're not getting any famous quotes from me this time,'' he
said. ''I've had to live with the last one for four years.''

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia 3, Argentina 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Yugoslavia took over third place in
Group B of men's volleyball with a 21-25, 25-15, 25-23, 25-22
victory over Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   By taking one game Saturday (Friday night EDT), however,
Argentina put more pressure on the struggling U.S. team to reach
the next round. Under the tiebreaker formula, the Americans (0-3)
virtually had to sweep South Korea later on Saturday, then beat
Italy and hope Argentina loses to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs (2-2) are the team nobody wants to face in the
quarterfinals. Their relentless blocking and disciplined defense
make them very dangerous. If not for close five-game losses to
Russia and Italy, regarded as the two best teams in the world,
Yugoslavia would be the favorite to win gold in just its third
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina (2-2) lost its second straight match, slipping to
fourth in the group based on win-loss ratio.
</P>
<P>
   After splitting the first two games, Argentina took a 10-9 lead
in the crucial third, but couldn't put together any runs.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 24-22, Argentina got within a point on a terrific smash
by Marcos Milinkovic that bounced off the chest of a defender. But
teammate Pablo Pereira's serve was long, giving Yugoslavia the game
and setting them up for the match in Game 4.

<HEADLINE> Gore Watches Son Play Football  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUMBERLAND, Md. (AP) -- Pom-pom waving cheerleaders spelled
G-O-R-E as Vice President Al Gore watched his son play football
here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sat in the stands while Albert Gore III, 17, a Sidwell
Friends School senior, played tight end against Allegany High
School. The younger Gore also had several tackles as a linebacker

Carthage, Tenn.

   ''Allegany has a tremendous team. ... I thought our guys showed
some real character coming back from a deep hole,'' Gore said at
halftime, when the score stood at 28-18 in Allegany's favor. The
home team eventually won 47-38.

center.

   CHICAGO (AP) -- Hristo Stoitchkov had two goals and three assists
as the Chicago Fire beat the New England Revolution 6-0 on Friday
night to advance to the MLS semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, which won the quarterfinal series six points to three,
will face New York/New Jersey in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   On a rainy night that saw flashes of lightning at Soldier Field,
Ante Razov opened the scoring in the fifth minute off an assist
from Stoitchkov.
</P>
<P>
   Stoitchkov scored in the 14th and 17th minutes, with Razov
assisting on both goals.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Nowak beat goalkeeper Jeff Causey off a pass from
Stoitchkov to give the Fire a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Razov scored his second goal off an assist
from Stoitchkov, and Sam George completed the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Zack Thornton had the shut out for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago six-goal victory is the largest in MLS playoff history,
and the six-goal outburst tied a playoff record set by Los Angeles
in a 6-1 victory over Dallas on Oct. 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars will travel to Soldier Field to play the Fire on
Tuesday night. The teams have never met in postseason play.

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached For O'Hare Expansion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The city and the major airlines serving O'Hare
International Airport have tentatively agreed on a $3.2 billion
renovation project aimed at improving efficiency at the busy
airport, a spokeswoman for the city said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation will include the construction of two new
terminals and dozens of new boarding gates. It is expected to take
eight years to complete and increase the number of boarding gates
by at least 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is also intended to increase the number of flights and make
connections in and out of the airport smoother. The project has
involved months of negotiations between the city and officials from
United Airlines and American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, we have an agreement in principle,'' Chicago
Department of Aviation spokeswoman Monique Bond said. She said the
redesign will improve efficiency and help accommodate the airlines'
increased use of larger planes, such as the Boeing 777.
</P>
<P>
   Bond would not confirm the number of new gates involved. A
report appearing in next week's Crain's Chicago Business says the
plan calls for as many as 32 new gates, including 10 each for
American and United, according to sources familiar with the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation also will include new federal inspection
facilities in domestic terminals to give travelers a ''seamless
transition from domestic to international terminals'' for
travelers,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond did know when the deal would be made final.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare handled 894,611 flights and 72 million passengers in
1999, second only to Atlanta's Hartsfield airport.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Alaska IRS Officer Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A former Internal Revenue Service
officer was sentenced Friday to more than four years in prison for
using money his ex-wife embezzled -- much of it to gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph E. Wilson Jr. and his then wife, Sara Wilson, also used
the money to buy a home in Eagle River north of Anchorage, have it
extensively remodeled and fill it with $20,000 in furniture. Wilson
also took more than nine months off from his job as an IRS
collections officer.
</P>
<P>
   He was ordered Friday to spend 51 months in federal prison and
repay $38,000 in stolen wire transfers. He had been convicted in
May of money laundering, wire fraud and filing false tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   His ex-wife cooperated with authorities. She earlier pleaded
guilty to similar charges and was sentenced to two years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Little of the money is left, however, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Crandon Randell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of it went to Nevada and into the machines ... He was a
slot player.'' While in Reno, Nev., Wilson would stay for free in
the suite for high-rollers, Randell said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson denied any knowledge of the scheme. But federal
prosecutors said not only was he aware of it but helped his wife
spend the money.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Union Song Was a Joke  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANPORT, Pa. (AP) -- Who would sing a union song to a baby as a
lullaby? Not Al Gore's mother, he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He'd just been joking, he said Friday, when he told the
Teamsters last week that she'd sung him to sleep that way.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had told the story Monday night in Las Vegas, in accepting
the Teamsters' endorsement. ''I still remember the lullabies I
heard as a child,'' Gore said, singing a bit to the delight of his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans jumped on that, saying the song, ''Look for the
Union Label'' hadn't been written when he was a child. More
evidence, they said, that he can't be trusted, along with his
recently revised story about his mother-in-law having to pay more
than his dog for the same arthritis medicine.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's campaign also leapt on something Gore said
Friday when discussing his proposal to release some oil from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help bring down high heating oil and
gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been a part of the discussions on the strategic reserve
since the days when it was first established,'' the vice president
said.
</P>
<P>
   The reserve was established in 1975. Gore didn't come to
Washington as a congressman from Tennessee until 1977, the Bush
campaign noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can't help himself,'' Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said,
suggesting the Democrat was telling ''fairy tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane responded that Gore served
on a House Commerce Committee panel that ''oversaw the development
of the reserve in the 1970s while Bush was establishing an oil
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, asked about his use of the union song at a news conference
Friday, laughed and said he'd been joking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody sings a lullaby to a baby about the union label,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ''I'm not talking about my mother-in-law any more. I
may talk about my dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway declined to answer questions raised
by the GOP about whether Gore's mother-in-law receives prescription
drugs through insurance or the White House medics who provide care
to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not giving out information on her private medical
record,'' Hattaway said.
