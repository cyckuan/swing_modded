ATTENDANTS UNION WAITING FOR BETTER OFFER FROM AMWEST 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   With a strike showdown looming in 15 days, America West Airlines
and its flight attendants are still at odds over how much the
company can boost wages and stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants union says the Tempe carrier is offering
too little in its proposal to raise starting pay from $14.28 per
hour to $16.13, and the top wage from $24.41 to $34.59.
</P>
<P>
   Another big sticking point is per-diem pay during layovers.
</P>
<P>
   America West says it's a fair offer for the 2,400 flight
attendants, based on its position as the country's ninth-largest
airline with a revenue disadvantage of 23 percent, compared with
the six largest U.S. carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The union's goal, according to Bill McGlashen, president of the
Association of Flight Attendants Council 66, is to get wages as
close as possible to the industry average for the top 10 airlines:
$15.11 per hour for starting flight attendants and $39.50 for those
with more than 12 years of experience.
</P>
<P>
   What will it take to settle the dispute, short of a strike that
would disrupt Arizona's spring travel season and cost America West
millions of dollars in lost revenue?
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the flight attendants union say their demands do not
threaten America West's viability but reward the flight attendants
for their loyalty during tough economic times earlier this decade
and allow them to share in the company's current prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good contract causes a little pain on both sides,''
McGlashen said. ``The flight attendants feel there is no pain in
this contract for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   America West says its offer improves total compensation nearly
16 percent the first year and just shy of 45 percent after five
years. The carrier is taking its offer straight to the flight
attendants with letters to them and a Web site that explains how
much each worker's pay would increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we want to reach an agreement, we will not
compromise the viability of the company to do so,'' America West
Chairman William Franke said in a letter to flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   The AFA is saying that the company needs to increase its offer
by $16.5 million, but it has not disclosed its proposed pay scale.
</P>
<P>
   With a strike deadline of 10 p.m. March 19, and last-minute
negotiations expected to start as early as next weekend, the union
is holding out, anticipating that the company has not yet made its
best offer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to higher salaries, the AFA is seeking better
per-diem pay and compensation for attendants' extra time, when
flights run longer than scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   America West pays flight attendants on overnight trips $2 per
hour from when they check out after their last flight to when they
check in the next morning, according to Greg Garger, vice president
of labor relations. They are not paid during layovers.
</P>
<P>
   The industry standard is for flight crews to be paid from the
time they check in at their base city to when they check out,
McGlashen said.
</P>
<P>
   That is how America West's pilots are paid. They receive
per-diem of $1.80 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   America West is offering the flight attendants $1.30 per hour,
increasing to $1.50 after 2{ years and $1.75 at the end of the
five-year contract. The current per-diem system is worth about 89
cents per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Per-diem pay is a fundamental issue for flight attendants, and
they want their rate to be on par with the company's pilots,
McGlashen said, adding that the flight crews all stay in the same
hotels and generally eat at the same restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   America West says its offer would initially increase per-diem by
$1,066 annually, or 46 percent for a flight attendant working 80
credit hours per month.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for the increased per diem, the company wants
flight attendants to give up a proposed provision that would pay
them for all of their time when a flight runs longer than
scheduled. America West wants to pay only for the extra time if it
exceeds 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It may not sound like much, but the extra time adds up and can
amount to a loss of up to 3 percent of a flight attendant's annual
salary, McGlashen said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ledger, the company is offering a
maximum of five weeks of vacation (up from three weeks), increased
flexibility in scheduling and a provision allowing flight
attendants to save up more sick leave.
</P>
<P>
   Is it enough to satisfy the union, which has been seeking an
initial contract for the flight attendants for four years?
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Buttrick, an airline analyst for PaineWebber in New York,
said he senses that the economic differences can be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But from an emotional standpoint there's so much pent-up
frustration and anger, and that pent-up frustration is going to
need to find an appropriate vent,'' he said, hinting that a strike
may be inevitable. &QL;

Everyone's a contender for Big 12 men's tournament title
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KANSAS CITY _ It would be fair to say that the first two years of
the Big 12 men's basketball tournament lacked a little drama. It
was Kansas and the other 11 teams, each of which had slim hopes of
knocking off the Jayhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the kids felt we were selling them a bill of goods the
past two years by telling them we could go win this tournament,''
Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson said. ``There's no question things
have changed. It's up for grabs now, and I think it is going to be
more fun for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas (18-11 overall and 13-3 in league play) enters the
tournament as the regular-season champion and the top seed, but the
Longhorns are not an overwhelming favorite the way Kansas was the
last two years at Kemper Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the tournament is wide-open and everybody knows it,''
Texas coach Rick Barnes said. ``A very fine line separates the top
from bottom, and we saw that in games last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M defeated Oklahoma, Texas Tech upended Nebraska and
Iowa State surprised Kansas in games leading up to the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a great team in our league, but we have a lot of
real good ones,'' Oklahoma State coach Eddie Sutton said. ``There
are more quality teams in the field than I've seen in the past. We
have more teams capable of winning the championship than ever
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven teams enter the tournament with at least 18 victories and
nine teams have winning records for the season. But the Big 12 does
not have a team ranked in the top 20. Missouri is the only ranked
team at No. 24 after its victory over Texas at Austin on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our league has been unfairly criticized,'' Texas Tech
coach James Dickey said. ``I still think we deserve to have five
teams in the (NCAA) Tournament. The only difference is we didn't
have a bell cow this year like we did with Kansas the last two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas is 19-9 and 11-5 this season and enters the tournament as
the No. 3 seed. It is a year that most teams would be proud of, but
it isn't up to the Jayhawks' normal top-10 standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just expect Kansas to beat up on everybody,'' Colorado
coach Ricardo Patton said. ``But they have some youth they are
depending on right now. That's the transition period they are going
through. They have some young guys who are going to be great
players in this league, like (Eric) Chenowith, (Jeff) Boschee and
(Kenny) Gregory.''
</P>
<P>
   Chenowith, a 7-foot center, and Gregory, a 6-5 guard, are
sophomores. Boschee, a 6-1 point guard, was voted the Big 12
Freshman of the Year. But this season was an adjustment for a
Kansas program that lost two All-Americans in Raef LaFrentz and
Paul Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the (Big 12 tournament) championship game last year, we led
Kansas at halftime,'' Sampson said. ``Then Paul changed in a phone
booth and took over the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are no Paul Pierces in this tournament, and
certainly no Raef LaFrentz. There are a lot of good players in the
league, but the talent is more spread out. Texas has three good
ones (Chris Mihm, Gabe Muoneke and Kris Clack), but everybody has
one or two.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns trio is why Sutton still believes Texas should be
considered the favorite to win the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has some go-to guys down low that really make a big
difference,'' Sutton said. ``If Texas has a game where they are not
shooting well outside, they can concentrate on getting the ball
down to the low post. That's a luxury we don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas will play Friday at noon against the winner of the Iowa
State-Colorado game today. Oklahoma State (19-9, 10-6) needs a win
over Baylor today to play Oklahoma at 2:20 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   OSU and Nebraska (18-11, 10-6) are believed to be the two teams
that need to win some games this week to be assured of an at-large
spot in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did something last week I've never done before,'' Sutton
said. ``I called a member of the (NCAA selection) committee, who
happens to be an old friend. I told him, if it comes down to an
at-large bid, I hoped he would consider our loss at Kansas. That
was a tough loss on a very tough call.''
</P>
<P>
   OSU lost 67-66 in overtime when Adrian Peterson was called for a
controversial foul on a last-second shot attempt by Ryan Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we won that game, we would have been seeded here and
probably already be in the (NCAA) tournament,'' Sutton said.
``Seven of our losses have come against teams that likely will be
in the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   And what did the committee member, a person Sutton would not
name, say to Sutton?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised,'' Sutton said. ``He told me he saw the
game, and he would be surprised if every member of the committee
didn't see it. It shows how seriously they take this
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The four bye teams in the Big 12 tournament _ Texas, Missouri,
Kansas and OU _ probably have a spot in the NCAA field regardless
of how they do in the Big 12 tournament. The other eight teams in
the conference will have to win four games in four days to claim an
automatic bid in the NCAA field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very difficult task,'' Sutton said of the four wins
in four days. ``I didn't realize earlier that only one team has
ever done that. Auburn did it one year in the SEC.''
</P>
<P>
   But all the Big 12 coaches believe the chances of that happening
this year in the Big 12 tournament are much better than they were
the first two years of the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are 11 teams that believe they can win this
tournament,'' Missouri coach Norm Stewart said. ``I don't know who
I would pick, but I have lot confidence in our team.''

Rockets' meeting addresses means to communicate
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
After two weeks of game after game after game, the weary Rockets
finally get a break in their schedule. Or at least as close to a
break as you get in the NBA this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Clippers, the bunch that always seems to be
circled in red on every team's schedule, come to Compaq Center
tonight, mired in another of those slumps they always seem doomed
to endure. The Clippers have lost all 13 games they have played,
and there's no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Or is there?
</P>
<P>
   The way the locals have been playing, you have to wonder if the
Clippers aren't the ones who have broken out the red markers and
circled tonight's game as their chance to finally break through.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they must be champing at the bit to play the Rockets,
who were blown out by the struggling San Antonio Spurs 99-82 on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rocket Mario Elie came to town with the Spurs and bombed
the Rockets for 15 first-half points, then sat out the second half
with a strained groin.
</P>
<P>
   That injury report was updated to a strained grin because even
the notoriously grumpy Elie had to be elated after whacking his
former team. That win helped the Spurs end not only a two-game
slide, but also end all the talk _ temporarily, at least _ about
San Antonio's struggles.
</P>
<P>
   Now that talk has shifted down Interstate 10 to Houston. And
tonight, the Rockets will face a team that is desperate for a win,
which could lead to a highly competitive game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more desperate than we are?'' said Charles Barkley in
mock exasperation. ``It couldn't get any lower for us if we lost to
those guys. That would be as low as it can go. We have to win
(tonight). But we can't really concern ourselves with the Clippers.
We have to get ourselves together. I'm excited that we're getting a
little bit better every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that process started when coach Rudy Tomjanovich and the
team met before Wednesday's practice to address the problems the
Rockets have experienced, and all agreed it was a productive
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had a good talk about being a team and
communicating as a unit and feeling free to do it the right way in
the locker room _ about where we're at,'' Tomjanovich said.
``Because we have so many new guys that we have different ideas on
certain things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things are just lack of knowledge. Other things are
different ideas and philosophies, but we have to be on the same
page, no matter what that is. We got some good work done, I think.
I feel that we did.''
</P>
<P>
   As does Hakeem Olajuwon, who is adjusting his game to
accommodate Scottie Pippen. For Olajuwon, accommodation means
communication, which is why Wednesday's meeting was so vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communication is always important,'' he said. ``It doesn't
matter (how many new players are on the team). Even though you have
been together for so long, you still have to communicate and
reinforce it every time to become second nature, without thinking
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why this meeting today was very important because
everybody raises their concerns and how to solve the problem. We
recognized what the problem was, and now we are solving it. Now we
plan to move forward from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   And Olajuwon appreciates that Tomjanovich and the coaches sought
input from the players rather than attempting to dictate how things
would go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important because it is a team problem _
everybody is involved,'' Olajuwon said. ``Everybody is concerned,
so everybody has input to solve the problem, and that's the best
way, I think, to communicate for the players and the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, who has appeared frustrated at times by the Rockets'
fitful play, thought one of the most important issues raised in the
meeting was that the players will be more aggressive in holding
each other accountable for the lack of effort they exhibited in
Tuesday's loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in this locker room has the right to point any fingers
at anybody,'' Pippen said. ``We have to look at ourselves first and
realize that we're not giving a wholehearted effort. It's something
that we're not doing. (It can be corrected by) telling someone or
correcting someone in some way. That could even help. But we have
to provide more energy out on the court, and I think we all realize
that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, the players adjourned to the court, where
they had a spirited practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we had a good practice today,'' Barkley said. ``We had a
lot of energy left over from last night. A lot of energy left over
from last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully some of that energy will go into tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just look at the fact that we still have plenty of time for
recovery from the huge disappointments that we encounter,''
Olajuwon said. ``The best thing now is just to regroup and make
positive strides.''

Gervin's attitude cause for optimism at Houston
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ The start was dreadful but the subsequent
spirited rally gave reason for hope. Then, mere seconds into the
second half Wednesday, Gee Gervin lofted a perfect alley-oop pass
to a soaring William Stringfellow, who had cut hard to the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   As should be the result of such a textbook play, there was
nothing but fresh air between String and the twine below him. That
gimmie jam would have cut UNC Charlotte's lead to three points,
down from 13 early in the game. That no-brainer jam might have
provided the impetus for a Cougars upset of a fairly decent NCAA
Tournament-bound team, thus giving Clyde Drexler something tangible
as he hits the recruiting trail in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Stringfellow somehow bricked the dunk and, inside of five
minutes later, the 49ers had blown out to a 15-point lead. The end
for UH was nigh. The big Fellow, utterly deflated by his
all-but-impossible gaffe, fouled out with more than 11 minutes to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see the look on (Stringfellow's) face,'' Drexler
said. ``It took all the wind out of his sails.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gervin, dragging around on a throbbing heel, was to be
finished himself soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Gee whiz. Conference USA's regular-season assists leader never
registered a single one against the Niners, and he scored only 13
points to boot, seven off his C-USA leading average. His final
moments of an otherwise glorious UH inaugural season would be spent
on the bench with one shoe missing and his face hidden under a
towel.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed covered up so long we began to worry about him
suffocating. Gervin even changed seats once without ever removing
his shroud.
</P>
<P>
   Back for his senior season
</P>
<P>
   But his disconsolate countenance should have filled the Cougars'
hearts with joy. If you think this 75-51 first-round facial
courtesy of UNC Charlotte's defensive web was an unmitigated
disaster for the Cougars, think again. Rather, like Gee, it was a
blessing in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go out like this,'' Gervin said, ``would be a disgrace. I'm
looking forward to next year, to coming back to the tournament and
having a strong showing.''
</P>
<P>
   So he will ignore the NBA's siren's song and, to make amends,
stay at UH for his senior season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' Gervin said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh
</P>
<P>
   Rumors, you see, had begun circulating that Gee was
contemplating leaving for pro ball. That would not have been a nice
thing for a long-humbled program that's suddenly just one elite
recruiting class away from a return to national prominence, to high
hopes and legitimate aspirations for a place in the rankings sun
and March Madness participation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Drexler, the talent magnet, is off to a nice start in
procuring the kind of lads needed to play with, and beat, the big
ones, it's his intention to build around Gervin, a player he has
come to greatly admire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much better than I thought he was,'' Clyde said. ``He had
a fabulous year. I felt bad for him today, that he didn't get to
use the tournament to show people what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Niners' own first-year head coach, Bobby Lutz, drew up
another smart game plan for stopping Gervin _ he always does _ but
it proved to be overkill. Gee was a step slow from the get-go and
would have had a difficult time beating a lone defender, never mind
the two or three coming at him from all points on the compass.
</P>
<P>
   Respect from an opponent
</P>
<P>
   It was a measure of the respect Lutz has for Gervin that he put
his best athlete, the 6-7, 205-pound Galen Young, on Gee, a
relative wisp at 6-2, 165, and sent plenty of help Young's way,
too. With Gervin hogtied, turned every which way but loose, UH
produced its worst offensive effort of the season by far.
</P>
<P>
   Where does Gervin go from here, if not to the bank and Benz
dealer? First to rest _ and probably to the doctor for an MRI on
his foot _ then straight to the weight room. Although he knows he
can't get any larger, he can get stronger. He has to, what with the
way people keep banging on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can gain some weight, musclewise,'' he said. ``But only so
much. I mean, my father was 6-8, 180.''
</P>
<P>
   And his mother, Joyce, is maybe 5-3. But Gee is an Ice cube off
the old block as far as his hoops instincts are concerned. He's a
scorer like George, despite being vertically challenged relative to
Pop's height. Drexler sees him having a bright future in the NBA,
where the illegal defense rule will give him considerably more
wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't see anybody like Young on him, either,'' Clyde said.
``That would be like me covering him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the buzz that Gervin was eyeballing the NBA, Drexler
denied knowledge of same but responded in a tactful manner, saying
father would know best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell him anything his dad can't,'' Drexler said.
``That would be their decision. I wouldn't try to advise him,
unless he asked me to.''
</P>
<P>
   A moot point now, it appears. A bad day would get no worse.

Playing time puts Astros' Everett in the swing
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Astros hitting instructor Tom McCraw, who has
been in the business a quarter-century, has a theory: With enough
playing time and a little attention, most players will have their
coming-out-party within three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett was right on time.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his three-plus major-league seasons, in
his first season with the Astros, Everett finally learned what it
was like to play. Not just an occasional start or pinch-hit
assignment, but to really play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been the problem my whole career I never played every
day,'' said Everett, the Astros' starting center fielder heading
into the season. ``Everybody wanted to say I couldn't do this,
couldn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's playing time has seen a sharp increase over the past
three seasons, as has his average.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he started 36 games and batted .240. He started 101
games in his last season with the New York Mets in 1997, hitting
.248 with 14 home runs and 57 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   With the Astros last year, Everett started 113 times, setting
career highs for at-bats (467), runs (72), hits (138), doubles
(34), triples (four), homers (15) and RBIs (76).
</P>
<P>
   ``If a young offensive player is talented and is getting his
at-bats, he doesn't blossom until his third or fourth year. That's
when you see it come together,'' McCraw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young players come up and down (from the minor
leagues to the majors). I think you can take all of Carl's pieces
of years, put them together, and he was in his fourth year when he
blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is if you get a guy, for any number of reasons,
who doesn't get his chance to play and develop in that third year,
he's going from a prospect to a suspect (in some people's eyes).
Nobody takes into consideration that he hasn't been playing,
getting 300 at-bats. He's in the big leagues getting 100 or 200
at-bats, playing part time, spare here, spare there.''
</P>
<P>
   Before finalizing the deal to acquire Everett last winter, the
Astros consulted with McCraw, who worked with the 27-year-old
outfielder briefly while McCraw was in New York. By the time McCraw
left for Houston, Everett had started to develop as a productive
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us Carl was ready to come into his own,'' manager
Larry Dierker said. ``He really thought Carl was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon joining the Astros, Everett became part of a center-field
platoon with rookie Richard Hidalgo. By the end of May, Hidalgo was
sidelined with a separated shoulder and Everett had assumed the
starting role on a full-time basis.
</P>
<P>
   He became comfortable with his surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   From June 2 to July 31, Everett owned the steadiest bat in the
Astros' lineup, hitting .318 during one 25-game stretch with seven
homers and 39 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   His batting averaged topped out at .351 on June 10, when he was
near the top among NL hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Everett said his breakthrough season was all about getting
enough opportunities to step to the plate. His 467 at-bats last
season were 275 more than he got in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the case with anyone,'' Everett said. ``You take any
player and sit him out for 10 days and then ask him to do what he
normally does, and it's not going to happen. No player in baseball
can sit out 10 days and come back and be themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The drop in Everett's performance came during the final two
months, when Hidalgo's return necessitated a return to the platoon.
Everett's average dipped 25 points to .296.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first year he had a chance to play through some
slumps,'' Dierker said. ``I think he went a long way toward proving
those hot streaks were something that if you left him out there, it
would come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think last year was a fluke. I think he'll have a good
year again this year.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Astros would like Everett to work on is his
running. He was thrown out 12 times in 26 stolen-base attempts, a
factor Everett attributes to getting bad jumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went when I shouldn't and didn't go when I should have,''
Everett said. ``I've never had that much trouble (in the past)
stealing bases.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett will be counted on to carry an extra load in 1999
following the loss of left fielder Moises Alou, who had knee
surgery Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Everett will play center while Hidalgo moves to left. Dierker
has plans to try using Everett second in the batting order, though
he could hit where he did last year _ sixth or seventh _ or maybe
even fifth.
</P>
<P>
   As for pressure, Everett doesn't believe he has to duplicate
Alou's 38 homers and 124 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never think about pressure because it's a game you can only
do what you're able to do,'' Everett said. ``If there is any
pressure, it's pressure you put on yourself.''

West Coast events take toll on Doral
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MIAMI _ The PGA Tour has come east finally, wondering how in the
world the monthlong swing through Florida is going to live up to
the first two months on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, it can't.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't individual moments like David Duval's 59 at the Bob
Hope Chrysler Classic or the debut of the World Golf Championships
at last week's match-play tournament that made the West Coast swing
such a hard act to follow (although they didn't hurt). It was the
whole, grand picture. Tiger Woods and Duval played six tournaments
in the eight weeks. Woods won once, Duval twice. Other winners
included big names like Payne Stewart and Ernie Els. Television
ratings soared at most events.
</P>
<P>
   But for every rise, there has to be a fall. While the top 64
players were at the Match Play Championship last week, the Tucson
Open had an obviously weakened field.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the Florida swing begins at the Doral-Ryder Open,
traditionally one of the Tour's strongest tournaments that signals
the beginning of the countdown to the Masters in early April.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, it's not quite as formidable as in the past.
Only one of the top seven players in the Official World Golf
Rankings (Els) is playing and only one of the top seven
money-winners so far this year (John Huston) is in the field.
</P>
<P>
   No Woods. No Duval. No Jeff Maggert, who is No. 1 on the money
list after his win at La Costa. No Davis Love III, Mark O'Meara,
Phil Mickelson or Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Doral is bereft of quality, name-brand players. Among
those in the field are Els, Greg Norman, John Daly, Steve
Elkington, Nick Price, Jesper Parnevik and Vijay Singh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doral is kind of like Pebble Beach,'' said Elkington after his
pro-am round Wednesday. ``It's always going to get a lot of the top
players, no matter when it comes up on the schedule. It's a good
place to come to.''
</P>
<P>
   As Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said, there's nothing wrong
with the picture when looking at the field in the first week after
the match-play event.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of PGA Tour events would kill for this field,'' Finchem
said. However, he added that Doral may be getting by this year
somewhat on its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to say that Doral is feeling the effects of
post-major bailout. Not that the match-play tournament is a major
championship. But it was required attendance for the top 64 players
in the world because it was the first WGC event and had a $5
million purse. Most of those players also tuned up by playing in
Los Angeles the week before.
</P>
<P>
   Anytime there's a big tournament, the unlucky event the
following week suffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doral is in the same position that we have been in during past
years,'' said Eric Fredricksen, executive director of the Houston
Golf Association, which runs the Shell Houston Open. ``When you
follow a major tournament, it has an impact on your field. Guys
usually play quite a bit leading up to a major tournament, then
take some time off.''
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame the top players for doing so? The biggest money
and the biggest prestige is what they play for.
</P>
<P>
   But Doral this year upped its purse to $3 million. Only six
tournaments this year will have bigger prize money and five of
those are invitational events.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Doral will represent the first full PGA Tour event
for Norman this year.
</P>
<P>
   Norman had shoulder surgery in April and didn't return to
competition until November. He has played a few competitive rounds,
such as The Presidents Cup, and he advanced to the second round of
the match-play last week.
</P>
<P>
   But this will be the first time he has teed it up in a four-day
Tour event since the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor doesn't want me playing more than two tournaments a
month,'' Norman said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman added that he has no reason to believe his game will not
return to the status it was before the injury, although if it
doesn't, he won't push any panic buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Norman has won Doral three times in the '90s, including 1990
when he shot 62 in the final round and won in a playoff. It would
surprise no one if he contended again this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to say Greg's the favorite this week,'' said Els.
``He plays this course great.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, at least, he used to. Doral underwent a facelift before the
1997 tournament and the remake was met with some discontent by Tour
players. That, combined with the West Coast boom, has made this
week a little less electric than usual.

Clippers threaten to sink to new depths
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DALLAS _ It's late in the third quarter in a one-third full Reunion
Arena, and Chris Ford wants to try something a little different. To
do so, the Los Angeles Clippers coach is standing in front of the
media table, shouting for the attention of guard Charles Smith, who
is dribbling the ball just outside the 3-point arc at the other end
of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Run the play, Charles!'' Ford calls out, his tones audible in
a relatively quiet building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Run the play!''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Smith finds room for interpretation in this request. In
a heartbeat, the second-year guard from New Mexico _ seeing his
first action of the season and therefore relatively blameless for
the team's wretched start _ squares up and hoists a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Smith, it finds the bottom of the net by way of
the cylinder. As the teams head back the other way, Ford's
expression is equal parts exasperation and relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice shot, Charles,'' the coach says, smiling thinly.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life in Clipperville, which despite any proximity to
Disneyland remains The Unhappiest Place on the NBA Earth. As the
latest incarnation of Team Lotto rolls into town to take on the
Rockets tonight, a place in history once again beckons the
woebegone Buffalo-San Diego-Los Angeles franchise, which seems to
find dark days and low comedy wherever it may roam.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's 112-99 loss to the Mavericks made it a baker's
dozen to open this strange, abbreviated season. At 0-13, Los
Angeles' ``other'' team finds itself just three losses short of its
own worst-ever start and only four from tying the 1988-89 Miami
Heat for the most fruitless beginning in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a season marked by tired legs, artless play and dubious
achievements, the Clippers continue to carve out their special
niche. Now, with each stop along the road, they find opponents more
and more determined to make sure the league's only winless team
remains that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be the one,'' the Mavericks' A.C. Green said
after his 19 points and 12 rebounds helped assure the streak would
live another night. ``You have a team that's on the brink of
disaster. You don't want to be the team they're going to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The pleasure of being First Clipped remains to be had, with the
Rockets next on the list of potential victims. Lose by a little,
lose by a lot, the Clippers have found a way to get it done each
and every time out, and the end might not be in sight.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part (and we use the term loosely) of the decade,
the Mavericks have been even more inept than the Clippers, winning
40 fewer games since the 1989-90 season and leaving the visitors a
little room to dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing disparaging,'' Ford said, ``but you think you have a
shot coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   The next one might be a while in coming. After tonight, the
Clippers go to San Antonio before facing the cross-town rival
Lakers in back-to-back games next week.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend continues, that first game against Shaq, Worm, Kurt
and Kobe could be for No. 16, tying the club record. The second
could enable the Clippers to match the Heat's league mark.
</P>
<P>
   That would set up a March 11 date with infamy as the Sacramento
Kings call _ a game perhaps not everyone circled when the revised
schedule was released.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clippers were bent on ending the suspense Tuesday night,
it wasn't immediately evident. Dallas scored 38 first-quarter
points _ a season best _ to open a 14-point lead. After seeing that
advantage shrink to 53-48 at the break, the Mavericks opened the
second half with a 7-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of things, Smith's shot selection by no means was
the most curious. In the third quarter, the Clippers insisted on
taking the ball inside on 7-6 Dallas center Shawn Bradley, who
blocked five attempts in the period and nine in the game while
barely so much as shuffling his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bradley) just stood there with that hand out, and for some
reason we continued to challenge him,'' Ford said. ``For what
reason, I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was done, the coach (who wasn't hired until Jan. 13
because owner Donald Sterling didn't want to spend the money during
the lockout) was promising lineup changes.
</P>
<P>
   Starters Lamond Murray and Eric Piatkowski had lost minutes to
Smith and rookie free agent Tyrone Nesby, and Ford said the latter
two would get more playing time in the near future. Forward Brian
Skinner, the first-round pick from Baylor, is back after missing
the first 11 games following arthroscopic knee surgery and is
expected to be more of a factor, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The energy the young guys are providing _ that's what I
want,'' Ford said. ``I've tried every way I can to get it across.
If they don't realize it by now, the younger guys will play.''
</P>
<P>
   But unraveling the mystery of the most intriguing of those young
players will have to wait. Michael Olowokandi, the 7-foot center
and first pick in the draft, was averaging 9.7 points and 7.8
rebounds before spraining an ankle against the Lakers on Feb. 26
and going on the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   So the bad times continue for a franchise all too accustomed to
insult and injury, not to mention being on the short end of the
score. Incredibly enough, the run is the ninth losing streak of 12
or more games in franchise history, and the Braves/Clippers have
proved remarkably adept at spreading joy wherever they go.
</P>
<P>
   Lest LA fans (those who care, at least) feel too put upon, they
can take heart in the knowledge the club previously turned the
trick in Buffalo and San Diego. Folks just down the coast once were
treated to a 19-game skid before their heroes won the final game of
that 1981-82 season.
</P>
<P>
   The crowning accomplishment, though, might have been the 1986-87
club featuring Benoit Benjamin, underachievement's poster boy. In
one particularly gruesome stretch, those Clippers lost 12 in a row,
won once, then dropped the next 16. As if to underscore this was
not the product of dumb luck and bad officiating, they ran the
table at season's end, losing their last 14 to finish 12-70.
</P>
<P>
   Now, old misery seeks new company. The future might prove less
dreary, but the present isn't crying out for a new pair of
Ray-Bans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's going to be easy,'' Ford said. ``No one's going to
give us a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean they haven't been happy to see the
Clippers coming.

Houston wilts in second half
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ They would have preferred sticking around a
little longer. Instead, the Houston Cougars packed up early and
headed home.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars' first-round game in the Conference USA tournament
on Wednesday hinged on a dead-battery start to the second half and
was terminated 75-51 by North Carolina Charlotte at the
Birmingham-Jefferson Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Their fourth consecutive loss to close the schedule included the
12th-seeded Cougars' lowest scoring output of a 10-17 season. The
49ers, the fifth seed, won their 19th game against 10 losses and
solidified their chance for at least an at-large berth in the NCAA
Tournament. After all, they came in with a No. 24 RPI and the
nation's 12th-toughest schedule.
</P>
<P>
   UH, on the other hand, exited with its fourth straight
first-round loss in the postseason, dating to the 1996 Southwest
Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have liked to have stayed for the weekend, but this
wasn't our game. We came out flat,'' said Clyde Drexler, who
concluded his first season as UH coach. ``We had a couple of guys
who were injured and not at the top of their game. Injuries are
part of the game that you deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Cougars' case, that was a difficult task with guard Gee
Gervin, an all-conference first-teamer and league leader in scoring
and assists, severely limited by a recurring left-heel injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was do-or-die, and I tried to give as much as I could,''
said Gervin, who spent the last seven minutes of the game on the
bench, a towel over his face to mask his dejection. ``The
tournament is when you always want to be at your best, and I
haven't been lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to being back next season with the guys
and with coach Drexler,'' added Gervin, seemingly dispelling any
rumors he might pass up his senior season to enter the NBA draft.
``I'm going to spend the offseason getting as strong as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   As was the case most of the season, Gervin was constantly
doubled and at times even triple-teamed, preventing his passing
off. Defended much of they day by 6-7 senior Galen Young or 6-6
Marlon Thomas, Gervin was held to 5-of-13 shooting, 13 points and
zero assists with eight turnovers. The 49ers thus limited Gervin to
11-of-29 accuracy in two meetings, including a two-point UNCC win
last week.
</P>
<P>
   With 6-9 forward William Stringfellow in early foul trouble and
6-9 Kenny Younger playing on a bruised knee suffered during the
game, UH struggled to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``UNCC was very aggressive on defense and on the boards,''
Drexler said. ``They had way too many offensive rebounds,
especially in the first half (a 13-3 margin), and we couldn't get
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger (18 points, 11 rebounds in the entire 40 minutes) was
practically the Cougars' only man on the boards after Stringfellow,
C-USA's No. 2 rebounder, had two early fouls before adding his
third and fourth personals 8{ minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   UNCC's Young (15 points, 12 rebounds) and 6-8 senior Kelvin
Price (19 points, seven rebounds, three blocked shots) were too
physical for the Cougars. Said UNCC's Bobby Lutz, who like Drexler
is in his first year as his team's head coach: ``We'd never be
where we are without those two guys.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lutz feels as certain as a coach without an automatic NCAA
bid can be about reaching the Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, there aren't any (doubts),'' he said. ``We felt we
needed to win today, but I felt we were already in.''
</P>
<P>
   Lutz said UH's first-half change to a 1-3-1 trap helped get the
Cougars back from an early 21-9 deficit to within 23-20.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great move, and we didn't handle it well,'' Lutz
said. ``But it didn't bother us in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers also shot 52 percent in the second half. The Cougars,
meanwhile, scored just 10 points in the first 10 minutes after
halftime and trailed 55-36 when Stringfellow exited on his fifth
personal with 11:37 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   UH, which had pulled within 31-26 at halftime, missed a slam by
Stringfellow to start the second half and went downhill from there.
Back-to-back treys by Treva Crosby and Gervin got them within 38-32
before UNCC's 23-6 run wrapped it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took our lumps this year,'' said Drexler. ``I thought we
did the best we could with what we had to work with.''

Rice, New Mexico vie in WAC quarterfinal
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEAL FARMER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LAS VEGAS _ The Rice Owls have one goal in this glitter capital of
the world: to look postseason sexy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls shot 52 percent from the floor in beating an inspired
San Jose State team 64-61 in the first round of the Qwest Western
Athletic Conference tournament on Tuesday. The only blemish: Rice
missed nine of its last 15 free throws to throw the game into
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shot the ball pretty well, just not at the free-throw
line,'' said Owls coach Willis Wilson. ``The free throws at the end
just made that part of our game look glaring. But I thought we
played well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice plays 25th-ranked New Mexico at 8 tonight in the WAC
quarterfinals at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center. The question now,
barring a tournament championship, is whether the 18-9 Owls look
good enough for the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have put ourselves in position to merit a lot of
consideration for the postseason,'' Wilson said. ``But first things
first. We have to try to beat New Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson believes the Owls can be tough when they dictate the
tempo. It doesn't have to be turtle-like, just methodical enough
for the Owls to put up high-percentage shots every time down the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing good basketball right now. Against San Jose
State, our defense was a little off, and I attribute that to the
Spartans' style of play,'' Wilson said. ``We feel like with each
passing game, the challenges get better. And we have risen to those
challenges. We're looking forward to going out there and playing a
quality basketball team like New Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said his biggest qualm about facing the Lobos is their
desire to run wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very good in the open floor,'' he said. ``They shoot
well from the outside and present a lot of problems. We'll have to
force them to build a half-court offense and not allow they to run
off and build a big lead.''
</P>
<P>
   UNM center Kenny Thomas, an NBA prospect, could be less than 100
percent. Thomas and teammate Damion Walker collided in practice on
Monday, and Thomas swallowed two pieces of teeth after the bump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny and Damion were just battling hard under the boards,''
said Lobos coach Dave Bliss. ``Things like that just happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rice-New Mexico winner will meet the survivor of today's
late quarterfinal between SMU and Moutain Division champion UNLV,
the tournament's host. The Mustangs got this far by edging Texas-El
Paso 65-64 on Tuesday on Renaldo Bratton's layup with one second
left, the result of a length-of-the-court drive.
</P>
<P>
   In today's first quarterfinal, Fresno State will take on a hot
Tulsa team. The Bulldogs on Tuesday overcame a trip straight from
Hawaii, where they closed the regular season, to Las Vegas, ripping
Colorado State 80-59.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State coach Jerry Tarkanian said he wasn't sure if his
team would be around after the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were dealt a tough hand,'' Tarkanian said. ``We had the
right to be tired and flat. If we didn't come out and play well, we
wouldn't even have needed to bring a change of underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah, projected unanimously as the tournament's winner, takes on
Brigham Young in today's second game. The Utes have tied a school
record with 19 consecutive wins and are coming off a 77-47 rout of
New Mexico in their regular-season finale. The eighth-ranked Utes
are in the NCAA Tournament; it's just a question of how high the
defending national runners-up will be seeded.
</P>
<P>
   BYU was a surprise 90-74 first-round winner over TCU. The Horned
Frogs, who were on the NCAA bubble, probably played their way into
the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   TCU coach Billy Tubbs, who was less than pleased with the
officiating, said his staff charts how many calls each referee
gives each team and that referee Scott Thornley made 15 calls
against TCU and two against BYU. But despite his anger, Tubbs
denied speculation that TCU would either go to the NCAAs or nowhere
for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard it was on the Internet (that TCU did not want to go to
the NIT),'' Tubbs said. ``I don't know where that came from. It
didn't come from our basketball office. If they want us, we'll
definitely go.''

DEVILS BEAT MAPLE LEAFS, 5-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Years from now the New Jersey Devils will be the
answer to a trivia question as the team that beat the Maple Leafs
for the first time in Toronto's new home, the modern Air Canada
Center, which replaced historic Maple Leaf Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils not only became the first visitors in four games at
the new arena to beat the league's most productive team, but also
did it in style, scoring five unanswered goals after falling behind
by two for a 5-2 triumph over the Maple Leafs on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept our composure after we went down by two goals and took
a couple penalties,'' said Scott Stevens, the Devils' captain, who
took one of the penalties in the second period while the Devils
were trailing on two goals by Sergei Berezin.
</P>
<P>
   After goals by Scott Niedermayer and Bob Carpenter tied the
score at 2-2, Jason Arnott scored twice and Patrik Elias added an
empty-net goal to help the Devils improve the league's best road
record to 20-8-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of character on this team,'' said Arnott, who
has five goals in the last three games to give him 18 for the
season. ``We knew we had to come back and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory pushed the Devils (34-20-8) into a tie for first in
the Eastern Conference with Ottawa at 76 points and extended their
Atlantic Division lead over idle Philadelphia to 3 points. Toronto
is 34-22-5.
</P>
<P>
   An instigating penalty against the Devils' Lyle Odelein for
fighting Tie Domi for the second time in the game proved costly as
Berezin capitalized on the man advantage to give the Maple Leafs a
2-0 lead 9 minutes 29 seconds into the period. It was an easy task
for Berezin as he had plenty of time for two attempts from Martin
Brodeur's right doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the last bright moment in the game for the Maple
Leafs, who lost for the first time in their new home after
victories over Montreal and Florida and a tie with Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer started the Devils' comeback with 3:21 left in the
second period with his eighth goal of the season, and Carpenter
tied it with 25 seconds left on the clock to send the teams
deadlocked into the third period. That set the stage for Arnott's
line.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott broke the tie with a blistering shot from near the
right-wing boards just 51 seconds into the last period and extended
the lead with his second goal of the night with another blistering
shot, this time from the left point at 11:35. Elias iced the
victory with his empty-netter with 44 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody keeps telling me to shoot the puck, and that's what
I'm trying to do,'' Arnott said of his recent success. ``Our line
is playing well and we're communicating well.''

MYSTERIES MULTIPY FOR L.A. ZOO OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A baby boom has hit the Los Angeles Zoo's
chimpanzees, deepening the mystery _ who are the fathers or father?
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone by the unexpected birth of Toshi in January,
chimps Gracie and Regina are pregnant, surprised zoo officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems like we can't stop them from having babies,''
said Vicki Bingaman, the chimpanzee keeper.
</P>
<P>
   Gracie is due later this month, and Regina will deliver in about
three months, zoo officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news in this unfolding story is that there is room in
the new exhibit for Toshi and the two others. ``They weren't
planned, but they are wanted,'' Bingaman said.
</P>
<P>
   Now as a safeguard, all of the chimps have been placed on birth
control, even though the males of breeding age have undergone
vasectomies.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly who fathered Toshi can't be determined for at least an
additional six months, when mother Yoshiko and she can be separated
for DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Gracie and Regina, handlers suspect Shaun, one of
three males vasectomized to prevent breeding. Yoshiko's mate might
have been Jerrard, another one of those vasectomized, zoo officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for limiting the number of births is to prevent too
many from becoming closely related, said Michael Hutchins,
conservation and science director for the American Zoo and Aquarium
Association in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Species Survival Plan called for by the association in
1991, all participating zoos must regulate their chimpanzee
breeding.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchins said he knows the Los Angeles Zoo is trying as best it
can.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are sometimes biological limitations. This is the
luck of the draw,'' he said. ``Abstinence would be a tough sell to
a chimpanzee.''
</P>
<P>
   The three vasectomized in 1996 were Judeo, Shaun and Jerrard.
The oldest male, Toto, was not vasectomized because he never
produced offspring and showed no interest. Glenn is believed too
young to breed, and Ripley is too young, said Dr. Cynthia
Stringfield, zoo veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Only Ripley, who still nurses, is not a suspect in the three
recent pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's Toto, then everyone will be thrilled because he's a
wild-caught male. Genetically, he is extremely valuable,'' Bingaman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although only 4, Glenn might be a long shot candidate because
sexuality is accelerated in captivity. Bingaman noted that
chimpanzees typically don't reproduce in the wild until age 12, yet
Regina delivered Yoshiko at age 7.
</P>
<P>
   So it's back to the pill for the female chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had a fail-proof method with the vasectomies,''
Stringfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Toshi was born, and two more babies are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was disbelief. Then it was excitement, and
then it was realization of the path ahead,'' Stringfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie, Pandora, Nan and Joanna have been taking birth control
pills in daily yogurt feedings since Feb. 21, and Yoshiko will
begin in April. Only baby Toshi is not on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The pills are just like those women take and should have a
similarly high success rate, Stringfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Hormone implants and vasectomies have not been as successful as
birth control pills, Stringfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials noted there were no pregnancies when birth control
pills were given beginning in 1991 following the recommendation of
the national zoo association.
</P>
<P>
   But the zoo switched to hormone implants because keepers had
difficulty keeping young chimps and males from eating the pills in
the older, much smaller enclosure. In the $5 million habitat that
opened in August, keepers can separate or catch the females when
they're alone, Bingaman said.
</P>
<P>
   Three chimpanzees were born when the implants were used between
1992 and 1994. There also were two miscarriages and one death
during birth, Bingaman said.

PRESIDENT HELPS TORRICELLI RAISE $2.1 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ On a day when millions tuned in to see Monica
Lewinsky on television and thousands turned out to see Hillary
Rodham Clinton in New York City, President Clinton stayed quietly
out of the limelight, flying to New Jersey to help raise campaign
money for Sen. Robert Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton arrived here late on Wednesday afternoon, his wife
was across the Hudson River in Manhattan, receiving the kind of
media attention usually reserved for the president himself.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is considering running for Senate in New York next
year, and her two-day visit to the city has attracted a horde of
reporters from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as the president was flying back to Washington aboard Air
Force One on Wednesday evening, ABC was broadcasting Barbara
Walters's two-hour interview with Ms. Lewinsky, whose book,
``Monica's Story'' is to go on sale on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the president said he did not watch the ABC interview
and would have no comment on Ms. Lewinsky's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The $1,000-per-person fund-raiser for Torricelli, who is not up
for re-election until 2002, drew 1,500 people to the New Jersey
Performing Arts Center here.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli's aides said the event, which took in $2.15 million,
was the most successful fund-raiser in history for an individual
member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech on Wednesday night, Clinton did not refer to
his wife's potential Senate candidacy. But Torricelli did, taking
credit for having started the drumbeat several weeks ago when he
mused off-camera before a Sunday talk show that Mrs. Clinton was
thinking about moving to New York to run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' Torricelli told the audience, ``I am
the man who created and is managing the Hillary Rodham Clinton
campaign for the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The event opened with appearances by several prominent New
Jersey natives. Kevin Spacey, the actor, was the master of
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The singer Cissy Houston, whose daughter is the pop star Whitney
Houston, sang the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   And the singer Gloria Gaynor performed two of her biggest hits
for the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   When he went to the podium, Clinton said he had been singing
along with Ms. Gaynor backstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to decide whether it was more appropriate for me
to sing `I Will Survive,''' he said, drawing wild applause from the
audience. But he said he preferred ``Never Can Say Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech touched on his major goals for the year:
securing the Social Security and Medicare systems, increasing
federal spending on schools and expanding the rights of managed
care patients.

SALMON BACK ON HIS (INJURED) FEET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Yes, Tim Salmon says, he's tired of talking about
his left foot. But at least he's saying good things about it.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon was limited to DH duty nearly all of last season because
of a torn ligament in the foot. He had surgery immediately after
the season to sever the ligament completely. He also had a
procedure on his right foot, and couldn't begin running until
January.
</P>
<P>
   But Salmon is running now _ and jumping, and sliding without
pain. He's playing right field again and says it's like he never
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I went back to the outfield, I was worried about my
skills,'' Salmon said. ``But when I went out there, it was like I
never missed a day. It was like last year never happened. I was
doing all the same things I normally do.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said he did not rush his rehab during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a good boy about it,'' he said. ``It was my career. The
last thing I wanted to do was set myself back. I even held back
playing golf, and I usually play a lot during the off-season.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season was tough for Salmon and he admits he felt like an
outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can't do what you're supposed to be doing, you feel
like you're letting the team down,'' he said. ``I was fortunate to
be able to DH. If I was in the other league, I would have been done
for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   In his six full seasons, Salmon has hit .297 and averaged 30
homers and 98 RBIs (including strike-shortened 1994 and '95), yet
he's never made an All-Star team. Salmon, traditionally a slow
starter, took extra hitting during the spring last year in an
effort to get off to a fast start. He'll do the same this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I got off to a good start in the first two weeks
(before injuring the foot),'' he said. ``I feel like it made a
difference. Whether it translates into an All-Star appearance, I
don't know. As I get older, it means a little bit more to me. But
it's not the reason I'm doing the extra things. I want to be
productive so this team can be a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina update: Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, out with a broken
bone in his left forearm, was X-rayed again Wednesday and was told
the bone is healing properly. He was fitted for a new hard cast,
which was the same size as the previous one that went from his hand
to biceps muscle.
</P>
<P>
   He had hoped the cast size would be reduced, which would enable
him to increase the amount of work he could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready for a short cast yet because it still hurts,''
DiSarcina said. ``I have no problem being cautious like that... I
may be hard-headed when it comes to certain things, but when it
comes to serious pain, I'm the first to bow out. The last thing you
want to happen is to re-break the bone. I guarantee I won't be
playing opening day if I have pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Deals and steals: The Angels agreed to terms on one-year deals
with pitcher Jason Dickson, infielder Justin Baughman and catcher
Bret Hemphill. The club still has eight players unsigned but has
until March 10 to renew their contracts.... The Angels will begin
selling individual game tickets on Saturday from 9 a.m.-5:30 p.m.
at the main box office at Edison Field. Tickets also will be
available at TicketMaster Ticket Centers.... The Angels begin
Cactus League play Friday at Tempe Diablo Stadium against the
Oakland A's. Every game except those on Sunday and March 28
(preempted by Lakers games) will be broadcast on KLAC beginning at
12:05 (PST).

COMMENTARY: AFTER INDY COUNSELS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 7th graf for clarification)  By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Back in the Bush administration, press reports
revealed the corrupt use of U.S. government grain guarantees to
help Saddam Hussein build his war machine before he surprised us by
invading Kuwait. When the Justice Department shyly turned away, the
need arose for independent counsel to explore ``Iraqgate.''
</P>
<P>
   No way, said George Bush, already burned by a special
prosecution of Iran-contra. His attorney general instead used a
patsy prosecutor until the Independent Counsel Act lapsed.
</P>
<P>
   During that '92 campaign, I called candidate Bill Clinton to ask
if he favored renewing the Independent Counsel Act to handle such
high-level corruption, and in this space reported his unequivocal
answer: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, I reminded President Clinton of his promise and
asked if he would sign the bill languishing in Congress. He
replied: ``I certainly intend to sign the law just like I always
said I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus publicly encouraged, the Senate Democratic leader, George
Mitchell, put the five-year renewal forward and the majority
leader, Bob Dole, brought it to the floor for passage. Clinton
signed it in June 1994. (For some reason, he has not returned a
call of mine since.)
</P>
<P>
   The act expires in June, and _ thanks to the unpopularity of Ken
Starr _ the idea of an unconflicted investigation of wrongdoing in
high places has become the loneliest legislative orphan in America.
Critics holler: Costs too much! Takes too long! Criminalizes
political mistakes and mere personal flings!
</P>
<P>
   Not since that catastrophic day in 1915 when the Lake Michigan
cruise ship Eastland capsized as it left its dock on the Chicago
River, drowning 800 passengers, partly because so many rushed to
the same side, has there been such a disaster threatened by a crowd
surging to one side.
</P>
<P>
   Not really a disaster; the Republic will survive when denizens
of the White House can rely on a political crony in the attorney
general's chair to shut down investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Renoism is already with us. The illegal financing of the 1996
election by Asian bankers buying influence was the recent case that
most cried out for aggressively independent probing. But Reno
defied the FBI director and punished a too-honest prosecutor who
had dared to recommend that the investigation be entrusted to those
not previously involved in malfeasant befuddlement.
</P>
<P>
   Because that internal Clinton Justice cover-up worked despite
the clear mandate of the act, even a man as steeped in Watergate as
Sen. Fred Thompson has thrown up his hands and joined the crowd
stampeding to the railing.
</P>
<P>
   What can be placed in the indy counsel's stead to prevent the
appointment to high Justice posts of dishonest cronies (like
Webster Hubbell), or to stop the present see-no-evil attitude
toward corruption by the politically grateful?
</P>
<P>
   1. Build some oversight into the way an attorney general selects
outside, ``special'' _ though not independent _ counsels. An
advisory board of judges appointed by all three branches could
provide the names of outsiders capable of giving ethical cover to
an administration under public pressure to show no conflict of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   2. Put more subpoena-power bite and professional investigators
into Judiciary committees to act as a whip on the backs of lax
Justice investigators. Such full-time ``oversighters'' would work
best when one House of Congress is of a party different from the
president's.
</P>
<P>
   3. Make the chief of Justice's now-laughable Office of Public
Integrity confirmable by the Senate. Sweep out time-servers
blocking reform.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these thoughts will be transmitted to Justice soon by
Reps. Gekas, Hutchinson and Graham of the House Administrative Law
subcommittee in an effort to get Reno to spell out its alternative
to the Independent Counsel Act.
</P>
<P>
   With no independent counsel, Congress must turn to serious
oversight _ pressing prosecutors to do their anti-corruption job.
The media should reduce their self-flagellation as well as their
dependence on prosecutorial leaks, and invest more in original
investigative stories.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, what will rebuild pressure on the powerful to obey
the law, stick to the truth and adhere to ethical standards? Only
the renascence of public outrage.
</P>

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: AN INTERVIEW PAINFUL BUT FASCINATING TO WATCH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With LEWINSKY-INTERVIEW)   (sw) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The promotions that ran for days showed Monica Lewinsky wiping a
tear from her eye, as if in a parody (or a promise) of the
inevitable: Barbara Walters always gets her subjects to cry. The
weeping Monica image came near the end of Wednesday night's
two-hour extravaganza, but the teasers were misleading in their
traumatic tone.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Ms. Walters as interviewer was guaranteed to
provide maximum sympathy and questions about feelings. Allowed to
shape her own image this way, Ms. Lewinsky created yet another
persona. She was not the hysterical rejected woman taped by Linda
Tripp, or the composed mature woman of her videotaped deposition.
Here she displayed all her lingering girlish delusions in an
interview that was surprisingly painful and fascinating to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The interview may have been a ``20/20'' news special, but it was
packaged and promoted with all the skill, though slighlty less
glitz, than the typical Walters pre-Oscar interview. There were
fewer family photos than usual, though there was a home video of a
chubby, adolescent Monica singing.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, Ms. Lewinsky softened her image. With her hair sleekly
back off her face, (conveniently matching the fresh-faced photo on
her book jacket) she literally looked less bubble-headed. Seated on
a sofa, she was viewed from a slenderizing angle.
</P>
<P>
   And though she got around to the sobbing, wrenching moments (``I
felt like a piece of trash,'' she said of her reaction to the
president's admission that their affair was wrong), through much of
the interview she was smiling, trying almost too hard to be
engaging and accepting. At times her words made her seem like a
lovelorn adolescent clinging to what she called a ``crush,''
giggling when she said of the president, ``He's a good kisser.''
</P>
<P>
   After all this, what can Monica Lewinsky add to the picture of a
presidential crisis? She might have helped answer a lingering
question: Who is the woman who provoked it? But the interview's
only hint in that direction came in its affirmation of how ordinary
the affair was. In Ms. Lewinsky's account, the president comes
across as a common lying cad, who said, ``I can't wait until I can
hold you again,'' then broke his promise about bringing her back to
work near him at the White House. That's bad news for those who
think the president should be a heroic role model, but it's a
realistic image for this non-heroic age.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Lewinsky had chosen a different interviewer, she might
have had to spin in a different direction. Oprah would have tried
to inspire her to change her life; Roseanne would have encouraged
her to dish the sexy details in the name of girl power. Ms. Walters
is the master of asking a tough question then letting the subject
off the hook without a tough follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you tell Linda Tripp about this dress?'' she asks
about the infamous DNA-stained blue dress from the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it was funny,'' Ms. Lewinsky answers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters then plays a tape of Ms. Tripp suggesting the dress
is evidence; Ms. Lewinsky smiles and shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Walters also knows how to let the famous reveal
themselves accidentally; that's why her interviews can be
illuminating in spite of her questions. On her daytime show ``The
View,'' she displayed a gift: a scarf Ms. Lewinsky had knitted and
handed to her in, of all things, a Gap bag. Ms. Lewinsky may be
acquiring a constellation of images; let's be grateful that Saint
Monica is not among them.

ROBINSON TO MISS GAMES FOR FUNERAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS   
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Kings coach Larry Robinson will leave the team
today for several days to attend the funeral of his mother, who
died late Tuesday in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In Robinson's absence, assistant coaches Rick Green and Jay
Leach will run the team. Robinson is expected to miss home games
tonight and Saturday against Nashville and Calgary, and is expected
to rejoin the Kings on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Isobel Robinson was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin out: The Mighty Ducks were without center Steve Rucchin,
their third-leading scorer with 22 goals and 56 points. According
to the team, Rucchin was sidelined with ``sinus problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin suffered a broken nose nearly two weeks ago in a game at
Calgary. Over the weekend, he took a shot to the head from San
Jose's Bryan Marchment, but Rucchin said he was not hit in the
nose. According to Rucchin, a combination of flu and the broken
nose was the reason he didn't play.
</P>
<P>
   Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg said, `His nose was basically
crushed in Calgary. I'm sure there's a combination of things going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Peaking Ducks: February was the best month in Ducks history, and
a big part of the reason was Teemu Selanne, who had 25 points and
was the NHL's Player of the Month.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks posted a 10-3 record in February, besting their 7-3-4
record in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Of Selanne, Hartsburg said: ``He's a unique guy. He loves to be
around the guys and he loves playing. That combination is hard to
find. Teemu makes the most out of every day, and I'm sure not every
day is the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kariya added: ``He's real good when things aren't going
well. He never gets down. He always has something to be happy
about, like getting a new car.''
</P>
<P>
   Selanne had at least one point in each of the Ducks' 13 games in
February, collecting a total of 12 goals and 13 assists. He scored
the 300th goal of his career Saturday against San Jose, reaching
that milestone in 464 games, the sixth-fastest in NHL history. Only
Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Brett Hull, Mike Bossy and Jari Kurri
scored 300 goals in fewer games.
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: The Ducks entered the game with an 8-2-4 record
against Pacific Division teams, compared with the Kings' 3-13
mark.... The Kings re-assigned center Eric Belanger to Springfield
of the AHL. Belanger, one of the Kings' top prospects, had been
assigned to the Long Beach Ice Dogs last week, for whom he appeared
in one game.... Winger Vladimir Tsyplakov, sidelined two weeks with
a knee injury, has been skating with a brace.... Kings center Yanic
Perreault, who has six goals in the last 52 games he's appeared in,
was a healthy scratch. Perreault was benched for the entire third
period of Sunday's 1-0 loss in Dallas. Winger Sandy Moger also was
a healthy scratch, and defenseman Philippe Boucher missed the game
because of a bout with the flu.

LEWINSKY INTERVIEW VIEWERS DISPLAY NO SYMPATHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
In the end, no one felt any sympathy for Monica Lewinsky.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The seven people who gathered at The Arizona Republic's offices
to watch ABC's Barbara Walters inter view the former White House
intern left completely revolted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the nation wanted to give her the benefit of a
doubt,'' said Gwen Moreno of Phoenix. ``I thought I would feel some
sympathy for her or something after watching this. But I am totally
disgusted with her. She has no remorse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the East Coast, viewers might have been talking about a
potential political career. In California, the topic could have
been a place for her in Hollywood. But in Arizona, in a ninth-floor
conference room, people felt stunned by Lewinsky's glowing face and
joyful smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at her. Her face is beam ing. She is so happy to be in
the na tion's spotlight,'' noted Jane Reddin, an attorney with
Lewis &AMP; Roca in Phoenix. ``Her words are not matching her face. We
see this a lot with witnesses. They say one thing, `I feel bad.'
But their face says something else. That's what's hap pening with
Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Why so happy? Why so proud? People in this room kept looking for
the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Murray, a Scottsdale sex therapist, thought it was
``euphoric recall.'' While she can't diagnose Lewinsky, Murray says
many people with sexual addictions often become elated reliving
illicit affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like she's going into euphoric recall,'' explained
Murray. ``She is so happy to be reliving the moments with the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Others had more simple answers.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Morales believed Lewinsky was beaming because she was still
in love with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is still madly in love with him. She's not in reality. If
she was my daughter, I would slap her,'' said Morales, a Phoenix
hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   No so, argued Sam Rogers, who works for the Environmental Protec
tion Agency and attended the im peachment trial on the first day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a profit involved here. This has been all very
well-orches trated,'' Rogers said. ``She knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   I had expected to come away feeling sorry for Lewinsky. After
all, she was just a 22-year-old in tern. But as I watched, the
distaste grew. It wasn't until the end, when I was hit with this
realization, that I felt some sympathy:
</P>
<P>
   No matter what Lewinsky does with her life, she will be always
be known as the White House intern who had an affair with the presi
dent.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, however, will be re membered as president of the
United States. &QL;

CRITICAL COMMUTER BRIDGE DAMAGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE FOSTER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Imagine a plugged funnel.
</P>
<P>
   With the storm-damaged Evergreen Point Bridge closed at least
until Friday, more than 120,000 cars, trucks and buses that flow
across the Lake Washington floating span each day will instead have
to flow somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Brace for gridlock on some of the worst-congested highways and
bridges in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn yesterday morning, high winds and waves shattered
mechanical parts that control the bridge's west drawspan. The state
immediately closed down the 1.4-mile bridge, one of the longest of
its type in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad thing is the damn thing broke; the good thing is that
we have spare parts,'' said Jerry Weigel, the state's chief bridge
and structures engineer.
</P>
<P>
   That's not much of a silver lining for drivers. Department of
Transportation television monitors Wednesday night showed tightly
packed lines of cars threading slowly through Seattle as commuters
who usually rely on state Route 520 detoured to Interstate 90.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the normal traffic load of 120,000 to 150,000 vehicles a
day from the Evergreen Point Bridge to the Interstate 90 bridge and
roads at either end of Lake Washington is expected to make
Thursday's commute especially long and tedious.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the rain continues, the whole area will experience a form
of gridlock,'' predicted Department of Transportation spokesman
Bill Southern. ``Start off early or figure out a way to car pool,
telecommute, or maybe take the day off. Think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or take the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Transit will add coaches to routes that normally use Route
520, shifting them to I-90 for the commute across the lake. The
longer drive will add time, but don't yell at the bus driver. Blame
the weather.
</P>
<P>
   State transportation personnel check the bridge whenever there
are sustained winds of 45 mph or higher. Wednesday, the gusts were
recorded at higher than 60 mph, and inspectors noticed the center
drawspan was moving around a more than usual when the lake is
rough.
</P>
<P>
   After consulting with maintenance engineer Tom Lentz, they
opened the drawspans at about 5:50 a.m. and found that two of the
vertical rollers and one of the horizontal rollers that keep the
movable west span in line had been damaged by waves. Also, 2-inch
bolts that keep them in place had been stripped of their threads,
Lentz said. A large support beam that holds one of the vertical
guide rollers was damaged and also may need to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stormy weather, the location of the damage
complicates the work. The damaged vertical rollers are in a small
space under the span, Lentz said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the center lock system that holds the two movable
spans together was broken while the span was being unlocked and
waves several feet high washed over the bridge sections.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation couldn't estimate the cost of
the repairs Wednesday. New parts could cost less than $100,000,
Lentz said, adding that the major cost would be in labor _ crews
working around the clock on 12-hour shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the key things,'' he added, ``is that we haven't found
structural damage.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the hollow concrete pontoons are sound.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the damage was the worst since the Jan. 20, 1993,
Inaugural Day storm, when waves whipped by winds of up to 80 mph
bashed the floating bridge, severing anchor cables and cracking the
pontoons, Southern said.
</P>
<P>
   More cracking, mainly on the bottom of the pontoons, was noticed
after a Dec. 12, 1995, storm.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that no structural damage or leaks were found
Wednesday, the damage is further evidence that the 36-year-old
bridge is aging while traffic over it is steadily increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a little like a senior citizen slipping on the back
steps and spraining an ankle,'' Secretary of Transportation Sid
Morrison said. ``It's just another reminder that this bridge is
approaching 40 years of age and exists in a strenuous
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   While state inspectors were checking the bridge Wednesday for
damage, a Trans-Lake Study Committee met on the Eastside to
consider ways of reducing traffic congestion to and from the
Eastside.
</P>
<P>
   Among the options are an additional floating bridge north of the
Evergreen Point Bridge, ferry service, and adding high-occupancy
vehicle lanes to the existing bridge.
</P>
<P>
   A briefing paper presented to the state Transportation
Commission a year ago put the cost of bringing the bridge up to
100-year storm design standards at $150 million. That would
involved replacing the anchor cable system and pontoons for
carrying the same four lanes of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a new six-lane bridge, including HOV lanes, has been
estimated at about $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, the cost of preserving the present bridge over the next
20 years would be $26 million, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   The state already has begun the preservation work, sealing
pontoon cracks and spending $5 million on new cables. In addition,
Weigel said, new high-strength cables will connect all the pontoons
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old bridge that needs a whole lot of work to bring it
up to standards,'' said state Rep. Karen Schmidt, a Bainbridge
Island Republican who shares the chairmanship of the House
Transportation Committee with Rep. Ruth Fisher, D-Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   A new one, added Fisher, would be ``one of those high-cost
projects that we cannot find the money for.''

RULING ON NURSES FOR DISABLED COULD COST L.A. SCHOOLS $18 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHARLINE CHIANG  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles school officials said the district
will be hit hard financially by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling
ordering public schools nationwide to provide disabled students
with nurses during school hours.
</P>
<P>
   An initial estimate put the Los Angeles Unified School
District's cost at $18 million for as many as 300 students who
could request the new service to attend school.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 ruling stemmed from a case involving a quadriplegic Iowa
teen-ager, whose family requested a nurse for the boy so he could
attend regular school.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. school officials complained the ruling is excessive and
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either the law has got to be altered, or someone is going to
have to find additional funding or else local school districts are
going to go bankrupt,'' said school board member David Tokofsky.
``Since we're a big district, we can cover these costs easier.
We'll just have less available for other programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The school district's $18 million a year estimate is based on
the district's enrolling 200 to 300 students covered by the ruling
and nurses costing more than $60,000 per student, according to
Bonnie Garcia, attorney for the district's special education reform
program known as the Chanda Smith Decree.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who has been following the Iowa case for about five
years, said since the law mandates full-time nurses, districts will
not risk ``cutting corners'' by hiring attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Placing certain handicapped students on campus could increase
liability to the school and place pupils at a safety risk, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have concerns that if they are so fragile that they require
a nurse and not an attendant, then that is a medically fragile kid.
All things assumed, we'd rather have them at home,'' Garcia said.
``That's a quality of care issue. That's a risk issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon first glance, local advocates for the disabled rejoiced the
ruling Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a cost impact to something like this ... but society
has to decide what it wants to fund for its most vulnerable
citizens,'' said Nancy Graves, director of consumer services in the
Ventura County office of the Tri-County Regional Center, which
provides services to developmentally disabled people.

installed through the construction of the US West Pavilion on the
east side of the arena, a project that has been delayed because of
the NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Machen, the arena's president and general manager, said the
two projects could solve the seating problems for hockey, a major
reason the Coyotes are pursuing a new arena as part of the Los
Arcos redevelopment project in south Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Coyotes official said Wednesday the team remains
committed to putting an arena on the Los Arcos site.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,200 seats in the north end of America West Arena provide
fans a view of only one goal. Machen said he doesn't have a final
figure of how many seats would be fixed under the proposal, which
should be made public in the next two weeks. Obstructed-view seats
in upper balcony of the north end probably will not be improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is definitely going to bring into play a tremendous
number of seats,'' he said. ``We're not going to bring 100 percent
of them in, but we can get their (the Coyotes') numbers way, way up
there with these two projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Machen declined to discuss the cost of the proposed renovation,
or how it would be financed. Sources close to the situation have
told ``The Republic'' that the cost will be around $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the limited-view seats are just one problem Coyotes
officials have with the arena. They maintain their lease at the
arena, which expires after the 2000-01 season, limits how much
money they can make through luxury boxes and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   That's as big a sticking point for the Coyotes as the seating
problem and probably a harder one to fix. Jerry Colangelo, Suns
president and chief executive officer whose organization operates
the building, said last week there isn't anything he can do about
the Coyotes' lease problems.
</P>
<P>
   He has said the Coyotes have a sweetheart deal at America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Arena revenue is essential to success in the NHL, which has
little revenue sharing, said Coyotes President Shawn Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is wrong here,'' Hunter said. ``The facts are there are
revenue challenges on a couple of fronts. Those challenges get to
be very painful as we progress and the cost of doing business
rises.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter declined comment on the renovation plans because he
didn't know specifics of the proposal, but he reiterated that the
Coyotes are focused on making the Los Arcos project work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we said we wouldn't do was pit two cities
against each other or buildings against each other,'' he said.
``That's why the organization chose to pursue Los Arcos; it
represented the potential for long-term success and, most
importantly, keeping the franchise in Arizona long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Coyotes, arena management and the city of
Phoenix, which owns the arena, began pursuing the option of
renovating the building.
</P>
<P>
   A Detroit architecture firm presented a $20 million renovation
plan that would have shut the arena down for at least two summers.
</P>
<P>
   Arena management rejected that proposal and began to work on one
of its own. The Coyotes, meanwhile, focused their efforts on a new
arena.
</P>
<P>
   Machen said architects, engineers and a seating company have
developed the latest plan.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan will involve some demolition work in the north end,
and Machen hopes the renovation will take only a summer to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   He would like to see construction begin in 2000, which would
give the arena's spring and summer tenants, the Rattlers of the
Arena League and the Mercury of the WNBA, time to adjust their
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Machen said, is to keep those teams in the arena
because moving them to other facilities in the Valley would cause
problems with marketing and confusion among season ticket holders.
</P>
<P>
   Machen also plans to consult with construction experts to
determine if it's feasible to do the renovation over a summer.

TACKLE, TACKLE, WHO HAS TACKLE?  
 FREE AGENT BROWN SIGNS WITH CLEVELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE Schoenfeld  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - By now, offensive tackle Lomas Brown's agents
have stopped negotiating with the Cardinals and realize that he is
a member of the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Or have they?
</P>
<P>
   Even after Brown announced on Wednesday he was leaving the
Cardinals to sign a three-year, $10.75 million deal with the
expansion Browns, his agent, Lamont Smith, still was talking to
Cardinals officials, according to team executives and sources close
to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cardinals officials said that Brown's agent told them
several times Tuesday and Wednesday that Brown had reached
agreement with the Cardinals, who were offering a two-year, $6.5
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 12:40 p.m. (Tuesday), Lamont called me on his cell phone to
say we had a deal,'' said Rod Graves, Cardinals assistant to the
president who was the chief negotiator. ``He was consistent
yesterday and today that we had a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's decision leaves the team with a huge hole at left
offensive tackle. Second-year pro Anthony Clement likely is the
favorite to get the job. But Bob Ferguson, team vice
president-player personnel, said the team also will address the
position with a ``high'' pick in the April draft. The Cardinals,
who no longer are interested in tackle Wayne Gandy, have two
first-round picks _ Nos. 8 and 21 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Smith acted independently of him and that the agent
knew he had chosen the Browns over the Cardinals as early as Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brown acknowledged that he was unaware what the
Cardinals' final offer was Wednesday because he had stopped talking
to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Things got so bizarre, that while Brown was giving a news
conference at his Chandler home to announce he had picked
Cleveland, Cardinals officials were trying to reach him by phone.
He signed the deal on TV in front a friend and business adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lamont Smith represented to us he had the authority to make a
deal,'' Graves said. `` He was adamant that he had the authority to
pull the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said there was a ``big misunderstanding in the line of
communication,'' and that as a result, he is considering firing his
agents, Smith and Peter Schaffer, who were unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might not be my agents much longer,'' Brown said.
``You're dealing with a person's integrity. When I tell someone I'm
going to a place, I keep my word. They were the ones who said I'm
not going (to Cleveland).''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he never second-guessed his decision Monday night to
pick the Browns over the Cardinals, who increased their offer
$500,000 on Tuesday. The increase matched a Browns deal that was
worth $6.75 million the first two years. In fact, the Cardinals'
offer was worth $750,000 more than the Browns' deal next season.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said his decision didn't come down to money. ``I left
money on the table by signing with Cleveland,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year pro wanted to be closer to his three daughters, who
live in Detroit with Brown's wife, Delores. The couple are
separated.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the Cardinals blew it nearly two weeks ago when they
couldn't close the deal. He said a deal seemed imminent but that
the team went five days without negotiating, so he decided to visit
Cleveland, where the Browns enticed him by offering perks such as
being the first player introduced at their preseason opener. They
also tried to entice him by telling him they might hire his Detroit
parking firm for stadium parking in Cleveland and talked to him
about a job with the team when he career ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a joke,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   All along, the Cardinals insisted they wouldn't sign Brown, who
will be 36 next season, to a three-year deal. Brown said he
understood their reasoning, but that he was bothered by comments
from Cardinals Vice President Bill Bidwill Jr. to quarterback Jake
Plummer that he ``wouldn't mortgage his future for a 36-year-old
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill Jr. denies saying that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (Plummer) we had a lot of factors,'' Bidwill Jr. said.
``I think I said I didn't think he's going to be playing when he's
40 years old. It wasn't denigrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said he knows losing Brown is an unpopular move, but
that free agency is only four weeks old and that there still are
other ways to build a team, including free agency and the draft.
The Cardinals' next target in free agency is re-signing linebacker
Jamir Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago at this time, people were saying, `Oh, man, what
are (they) doing?' '' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals then made the blockbuster trade with San Diego
that brought them two first-round picks, a second and two players,
and also acquired running back Adrian Murrell from the New York
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players who have been here the last year and a half know what
we're all about,'' Ferguson said. ``We're not the same team.''

MONICA LEWINSKY TELLS HER SIDE OF THE STORY, IN PRINT AND ON
TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs for new 5th graf) (See also LEWINSKY-MEDIA) 
(fe) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES and FRANK BRUNI 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Finally free to seek self-justification and
personal profit, Monica Lewinsky opened a double-fronted campaign
on Wednesday to explain the sexual affair that triggered the
impeachment of President Clinton and put the nation through a
harrowing year of scandal tracking.
</P>
<P>
   By television interview and book publication, the former White
House intern sought to frame a different, more sympathetic image of
herself as a venturesome romantic who meant well but became
ensnared in the criminal investigation of the president's
misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a pawn used to get the president,'' she said in the
book, ``Monica's Story'' (St. Martin's Press), written by Andrew
Morton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's sorry he got caught,'' Ms. Lewinsky said of the
president in the ABC-TV interview. But, ever hesitating to fully
renounce him, she added that ``when I think of the person I thought
Bill Clinton was, he had genuine remorse.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's demeanor in the televised interview was, for the
most part, poised. And she wore an incongruously upbeat, carefree
grin even when fielding questions from Barbara Walters about
matters like the nature of phone sex and her sexual candor with
friends about her affair. This cheerfulness _ and, at times, even
playfulness _ sometimes contradicted the image of herself as a
mature, intelligent woman that, with her opening remarks to Ms.
Walters, she seemed determined to project.
</P>
<P>
   The interview, with Barbara Walters on ``20-20,'' was one of the
first interrogations conducted without benefit of sworn oath by the
25-year-old California woman since she was confronted by
prosecutors 13 months ago. Her revelations caused a presidential
crisis in which Clinton finally was acquitted by the Senate last
month of perjury and obstruction of justice charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't dream of asking Chelsea and Mrs. Clinton to forgive
me, but I would ask them to know that I am very sorry for what
happened and for what they've been through,'' Ms. Lewinsky told
Walters in the first of a series of worldwide television and
magazine interviews that, in conjunction with her book, are
expected to garner multimillions of dollars, by the estimates of
her sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, for which ABC increased its commercial rates
for sponsors more than fourfold, Ms. Lewinsky could not discuss her
seven-month struggle to avoid prosecution in exchange for
testifying about the sexual affair. This stricture was made part of
her immunity deal by Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who
investigated the president and recommended impeachment. The Justice
Department now is considering an investigation of the fairness of
Starr's methods _ whether he misled Ms. Lewinsky and the Justice
Department in claiming jurisdiction to branch into the president's
private behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's book had no such stricture, however, and it
accuses Starr of ``a level of zealous malevolence.'' It endorses
Hillary Rodham Clinton's denouncement of Starr as a ``politically
motivated prosecutor,'' part of the ``vast right-wing conspiracy''
Mrs. Clinton has alleged.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are sentiments with which Monica, in the front line of
the war, entirely agrees,'' Morton writes.
</P>
<P>
   The account that the book gives of her relationship with the
president dovetails almost precisely with the one given by the
Starr report, although there are a few new details.
</P>
<P>
   Most striking is Ms. Lewinsky's revelation that during a lull in
the affair, she briefly dated a Pentagon employee, became pregnant
and had an abortion, which plunged her into depression and, at her
mother's urgings, sent her into psychotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   But what the Starr report obviously did not cover, and the book
explores in bracing and precise detail, is Ms. Lewinsky's treatment
by Starr, his deputies and investigators _ and the feelings she now
holds toward the independent counsel, a man who could still subject
to her criminal prosecution under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ```During his investigation,'' the book declares, ``Kenneth
Starr had not once met Monica Lewinsky, and yet she felt that he
had defiled and molested her _ not physically, but by using his
legal and constitutional power to strip away every last vestige of
her dignity and her humanity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In August of last year, when Ms. Lewinsky was still in the midst
of detailing her relationship with the president, Starr wanted to
videotape the session, held away from the grand jury, during which
Ms. Lewinsky recited all of her sexual encounters with the
president, the book reports. ``It would have been the complete and
utter destruction of my soul,'' Ms. Lewinsky tells Morton.
</P>
<P>
   But her lawyers quashed the idea, and Ms. Lewinsky instead
shared the information in a private interview with two female
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ms. Lewinsky tells Morton that the release of the Starr
report, with its exacting sexual details, devastated her. ``I just
felt that the world looked at me as a whore,'' she tells him.
</P>
<P>
   She concludes that Starr cared not a whit about his impact on
her or her family's lives. Her first bitter sense of being his
``pawn'' came on the day when she was detained by Starr's
investigators for more than 10 hours in a hotel in nearby Virginia,
lured there by her erstwhile friend, Linda Tripp, and the book
provides fresh details about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Tripp handed her over to Starr's investigators ``like
a latter-day Judas,'' the book says, Ms. Lewinsky reeled with
terror and despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if my stomach had been cut open and someone had
poured acid into my wound,'' Ms. Lewinsky tells Morton. She further
says that she looked at Ms. Tripp and ``wanted to hurt her. I felt
like an animal wanting to claw at her skin.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, when Ms. Lewinsky was finally allowed a
brief call to her mother, who had been paging her, an FBI agent sat
by her, his finger hovering above the phone, ready to sever the
connection if Ms. Lewinsky revealed where she was and what was
happening.
</P>
<P>
   The book asserts that even as Ms. Lewinsky was being threatened
with decades of prison time if she did not cooperate and even as an
investigator was flashing her the handcuffs beneath his jacket, she
strived to warn the president about what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, when she was allowed to go into a bathroom in the
mall near the hotel, she contemplated giving Betty Currie's number
and a set of instructions to a young mother changing her baby's
diapers, but decided against it. Days later, she was still trying
unsuccessfully to get word to Ms. Currie.
</P>
<P>
   The book portrays her _ obviously, in a flattering fashion _ as
a loyal, steadfast protector of the president, who had to rebuff
some of the tactics suggested by one of her initial lawyers,
William H. Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the car,'' Morton writes, ``he announced that he was going
to state publicly that the president had sexually harassed Monica
and that he was nothing more than a child molester.'' Monica
forbade it and pleaded to be committed to a psychiatric hospital as
a way out of the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   The interview and book gave Ms. Lewinsky, the face that launched
a thousand pundits, a long-awaited and oft-delayed opportunity to
vent some opinions of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Her assessments of Starr, Tripp and even Ginsburg, her lawyer
for several months after she was first approached by Starr's
deputies, are withering; her contempt for these players in her
personal melodrama is untempered and undisguised.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in many respects, ``Monica's Story,'' although written
by Morton in the third person, represents Ms. Lewinsky's attempt to
get even with the people who did her wrong, at least in her
generously lashed eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp is treated most harshly, and most snidely, making her
entrance into the narrative of ``Monica's Story'' as a ``lumpy
figure'' draped in a ``dun-brown business suit.'' The book says
that at one point, after being successfully coached through a diet
by Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Tripp could finally avail herself of some of
the larger dresses in what Ms. Lewinsky, whose own weight
fluctuated wildly, dubbed her ``fat closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg is portrayed as a glutton for attention who relished
hobnobbing with the media elite, spoke recklessly, sowed suspicion
and ill will among members of the Lewinsky family as a method for
controlling them and exaggerated his closeness with them.
</P>
<P>
   In the TV interview, Ms. Lewinsky said the ``most difficult''
and pointed question she faced in the long ordeal came from a grand
juror who asked why she has had affairs with married men. ``I know
I will never have an affair with a married man again,'' she
insisted. ``What I've come to see is that that happened because I
didn't have enough feelings of self worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Walters asked about Ms. Lewinsky's gambit in suddenly flashing
her thong underwear at the president. ``Where do you get that nerve
for that?'' she asked as Ms. Lewinsky laughed and described it as a
``small, subtle, flirtatious gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dance,'' she said. ``I think it was saying, I'm
interested, too. I'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said her mother sought to break off the
relationship but she stubbornly resisted. ``From the time I was 2
years old,'' she smilingly recounted, ``one of my first phrases was
_ with my hands on my hips: `You are not the boss of me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Confirming she sometimes screamed at Clinton in frustration, she
explained, ``I didn't see him as the president of the United
States. I saw him as a man. And that was how I treated him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My breath was taken away,'' she said of her first sighting of
the president at a routine White House arrival ceremony. ``It was
this man who was full of energy and sensuality and
attractiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the president reacted when she inquired if the affair
was merely sexual, Ms. Lewinsky responded, ``He started to, uh,
tear up and told me that he never wanted me to think that.'' He
said the president, when told of her love, declared, ``That means a
lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the president gave her hope he might some day
marry her, Ms. Lewinsky firmly responded, ``He did. He said, `Well,
I might be alone in three years.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She described White House officials who finally transferred her
away from the president to the Pentagon as ``the meanies.'' ``I
don't think that my relationship hurt the job he was doing,'' she
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I have warm feelings, sometimes I'm proud of him
still, and sometimes I hate his guts,'' she told Walters. ``And,
um, he makes me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, Ms. Lewinsky cried when she signed an
immunity deal to testify about her affair because she did not want
to hurt the president. But her feelings subsequently grew more
complicated and there were times she resented Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered how I could have ever cared about this man,'' Ms.
Lewinsky tells Morton. ``He was so self-righteous and
self-centered.''
</P>
<P>
   The book endeavors, in some fashion, to provide a psychological
deconstruction of Ms. Lewinsky and how she fell into an affair with
the president. As a child, it recounts, she sometimes wore a
T-shirt that said ``Daddy's Little Girl'' but was estranged from
her father after he and her mother divorced.
</P>
<P>
   The book's leitmotifs seem to be crying and dieting. Ms.
Lewinsky sheds tears just about every four paragraphs and filters
every episode through her weight at the moment. She even recalls
that the first time the president removed his shirt in front of
her, he sucked in his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will you tell your children, when you have them?'' she
was asked at the end of the television interview. To which she
replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy made a big mistake.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To hear it from the kids at her alma mater,
Beverly Hills High School, and her fellow Brentwood residents, the
Monica Lewinsky saga is so (italics) passe (end italics).
</P>
<P>
   It's so tired.
</P>
<P>
   It's so ... 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be really interesting, but now it's really
annoying,'' Danny Karotin, a 14-year-old freshman at the school,
said Wednesday. ``We're kind of tired of it, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, the prospect of buying Lewinsky's tell-all book,
``Monica's Story'' when it is released today, let alone watching
her televised interview Wednesday was just, well _ borrrring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got really old,'' said 10th-grader Natalie Housepian, 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are disrespecting the president now,'' she added. ``I
kind of disrespect Monica just as much. She had no business doing
that with the president in the first place. It's kind of
degrading.''
</P>
<P>
   Most students said they weren't going to bother tuning in to the
interview. Housepian said she might, ``if I don't have too much
homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's former attorney, William Ginsberg, said he's also
gotten on with his life, and suggests the rest of the country do
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a terrible way to spend our time and our money,''
the Los Angeles resident said. ``This is not what America is made
of, or what it stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her story is not that interesting. We all need to move on,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what folks want to do in Brentwood, the tony L.A.
neighborhood where Lewinsky's father and stepmother live, and which
was the scene of many a media stakeout during the height of the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Dutton, who has owned his namesake bookstore there for 15
years, ordered only 30 copies of the former White House intern's
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not anticipating a flood of interest,'' he said.
``Ordinarily I would've had a waiting list. With other books of
this nature we've had a lot more interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of these things that will have a very short shelf
life,'' Dutton said. ``I think she's a perfectly lovely young lady.
But I don't think she particularly has something to say to me.''
</P>
<P>
   At a cafe in front of Dutton's Brentwood Books, 16-year-old Gina
Merchant was flipping through a copy of Jane magazine and pondering
the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's our business. It's been blown out of
proportion,'' she said. ``There's more important things to be
concerned about.
</P>
<P>
   ``But some people fall into that trap _ it's something cool to
talk about because it's sex,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   A 16-year-old Beverly Hills High sophomore named Monica (no, she
wouldn't give her last name, and yes, she's gotten plenty of
ribbing in the past year) questioned Lewinsky's motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care. Nobody should care,'' she said. ``She just
wanted to write a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Vagabond Books, on San Vicente Boulevard in Brentwood, can't be
bothered to carry the publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh! I forgot to order them,'' owner Craig Graham said in mock
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a literary book store,'' insisted his wife, Patti. When
asked about a copy of the Starr Report on the front counter, she
replied, ``Somebody donated that to our shop. You can have it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Lewinsky stopped by the store at Christmastime, glanced
at art books and left without buying anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't wear a beret, so we didn't know who she was,'' she
joked. ``I feel sorry for her. Everybody was ragging on her.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for Lewinsky at a book signing there anytime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody around here cares,'' Craig Graham said. ``This area is
pretty sick of that stuff. People are fed up. They just wish it
would blow over.''

WESTPHAL'S WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   Coach stands by hands-off approach

<P>
   SEATTLE _ As a player, he could go right.
</P>
<P>
   Go left.
</P>
<P>
   Go his own way.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Westphal hasn't changed much. He's older. He limps on a
right leg that has begun to show the corrosive toll of 12 years in
backcourts for the Boston Celtics, Suns, Seattle SuperSonics and
New York Knicks. There's some gray in the hair. Lines circle his
eyes and run across his temples.
</P>
<P>
   Time has left some inevitable marks. Westphal, 48, can't beat
the years. But their passage is the only defense that has ever been
able to stop him long enough to leave an enduring label. The
ambidextrous player of the late 1970s and early 1980s is today's
many-sided coach with a range of philosophies that sometimes sound
contradictory and are always intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, his ideas worked in Phoenix. Today, he is working
to apply them in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two stops, some pragmatic lessons about politics and
people marked his career just as surely as that limp. The Suns
fired him suddenly in 1996. On the day his firing was announced in
a stunned room at America West Arena, he wasn't there. But his
Phoenix jersey was.
</P>
<P>
   The old Westphal number, 44, hung in honor high above the seats
at America West Arena. There aren't many who have had their number
retired and been fired by the same franchise. It's a unique double
from a unique personality. Go right. Go left. Westphal has his own
way.
</P>
<P>
   He looked back on his coaching experience with the Suns the
other day while sitting in an office above the SuperSonics practice
court. He spoke mostly in generalities.
</P>
<P>
   There always has been an air of mystery about the firing despite
a .685 winning percentage and his subsequent absence from the
league for more than two years. A palace revolt? A locker room
``coup d'eta''t? An exile imposed by a campaign of whispered
condemnation from former Suns' colleagues?
</P>
<P>
   Westphal won't point fingers. Disappointed? Without a doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it ill will,'' said Westphal, who faces the
Suns for the first time since his firing tonight at Seattle's Key
Arena. ``But there was certainly some disappointment attached with
personal relationships that I had. That's probably inevitable in
this business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of great memories. Most of my career was in
Phoenix. Most of it was positive. There are the fans, people and
players in the organizations and the city in general. I had great
years there.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's rancor, he doesn't express it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no advantage in that,'' said Westphal, a friend and
fan of conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh who used to
register at hotels under names from songs written by counterculture
icon Bob Dylan. ``I understand the questions. People would love to
have all the dirty laundry out there. Heck, I like to read that
stuff, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think it's good for anybody personally. And I
don't think it's good for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   For Westphal, it's always the game, first and foremost. He
thought about it while traveling up and down Route 66 with musician
John Stewart about a year ago. Stewart was searching for a
different America, which is a place that has always included one
kind of basketball or another for about a century.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal has played it on every level. More significant, he's
coached it on every level. He created and coached the program at
the Valley's Southwestern Baptist Bible College in 1985. He coached
Grand Canyon College to an NAIA title in 1988. There was time on
the Suns bench as an assistant to Cotton Fitzsimmons. Then, there
are the three-plus season as the Suns coach, before he was fired.
But the firing didn't change his enthusiasm for what happens
between the baselines. He worked as a volunteer assistant for
Chaparral High School, where his son Michael played.
</P>
<P>
   Big-time is a matter of perception and bright lights, he said.
The game itself is what endures.
</P>
<P>
   The problems, the separation point between him and the Suns,
came with his unyielding adherence to a belief in how the game
should be played. Westphal believes it belongs to the players. They
dictate style and strategy. It's not imposed from above by a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys go out of their way to prove how tough they are,''
Westphal said about perceptions that he was too lax. ``I can't do
that. For instance, there was always the perception that I didn't
coach enough defense. It's always been my belief that, if you win,
you played enough defense. I've always believed that the game is
played on both ends of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people don't want to hear that. They want you to go in
with a whip and chair and make a statement to these overpaid
athletes. I think there's a feeling out there that's the only kind
of real coaching there is. You know, beat them into shape.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Suns guard, it was Westphal's player-first philosophy that
eventually forced the Suns to trade him in 1981 to Seattle for
Dennis Johnson. Westphal wasn't comfortable with the strict,
carefully orchestrated style of then-Coach John MacLeod.
</P>
<P>
   As the Suns coach, it probably led to Westphal's firing. The
charismatic Charles Barkley, independent and profane, was the
breaking point just a couple years after he became the first Suns
player to ever be elected the NBA's Most Valuable Player. From top
to bottom, Suns management began to grumble about his escapades and
a Barkley-dominated offense that had grown stale.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably true, although I didn't think so at the
time,'' Westphal said. ``I think there were different opinions on
Charles. My feeling was that Charles was always who we expected him
to be. We knew there were going to be some negatives. We knew there
were going to be some positives. He came as advertised. My feeling
was, and is today: Why hold it against him for being who he is?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I can look Charles in the eye and he knows that I never
changed on him. I'm not sure everybody else can say that.''
</P>
<P>
   A player in the Barkley-ruled dressing room of that time was
Danny Ainge, now the Suns coach. He shared some of his teammates'
opinions that Barkley had been allowed to run amok.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, I was at times critical of the way he handled
Charles, although I was never as critical as say A.C. Green,'' said
Ainge, who believes the Suns of 1993-94 and 1994-95 were the NBA's
best despite their playoff elimination by Houston in each season.
``There were times when I thought he could be more firm. But, now
as a coach, I can see that Paul got more out of Charles than
anybody ever has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing that Paul Westphal did prevented us from winning a
championship ring. It was fate, or injuries, or whatever. My three
years under Paul was the most fun I've ever had playing basketball.
I liked every part of it. And I respect him a great deal. He's a
man of integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing tension in the Suns locker room was said to be factor in
Westphal's firing. There was talk of a team spinning out of
control, whispers of a plot led by Kevin Johnson and Green.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal says there were problems with KJ. But he also said the
two spoke with each other last summer for the first time since he
was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relationship is OK,'' he said. ``It is now.''
</P>
<P>
   He also talked about prevalent speculation of a rift between
Barkley and KJ.
</P>
<P>
   ``There probably was,'' he said. ``It's hard to get to the
bottom of those kind of things. To what extent it affected the play
of the team, to what extent it affected my firing, I can't say.
It's hard to say I would have done anything different, although I
question it all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that everybody has to look in the mirror. I know
I can. I don't know who else can. I'm not going to run around
trying to figure out who's lying and who's telling the truth. I
take people at face value. I've heard a lot of things. I don't know
who to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   But he does know how to move on. In his own way. &QL;

EASY, UNIT, DON'T HURT A FUTURE LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. - University of Arizona baseball Coach Jerry Stitt
gathered his team in the visitors clubhouse at Tucson Electric
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big game today, men,'' the skipper said. He checked his lineup
card. ``Smith, you're leading off.''
</P>
<P>
   Heads turned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smith? Where's SMITH?! Anybody seen Smith?''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was on the team bus, hiding, palms pressed together in an
attitude of prayer.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that didn't happen. Arizona doesn't have a player named
Smith. The Wildcats leadoff hitter is a fresh-faced youth named
Andy Juday, and even though Andy was apprehensive about facing
Randy Johnson _ who in his right mind wouldn't be? _ there was no
way the kid was going to chicken out and miss this experience.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours before the Big Unit ambled to the mound in his
pinstriped pants, looking even taller than his measured height of 6
feet 10, Andy sat in his Psychology of Sports class on the UA
campus.
</P>
<P>
   His mind was elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He was thinking. Imagining.
</P>
<P>
   Daydreaming as he has for a week about the moment when his name
would be announced over the stadium speakers and he would take a
deep breath to steel himself and head toward the plate, all eyes on
him, bat in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excited? Oh, yeah,'' Juday said before the game. He was
beaming.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old second baseman didn't feel like a condemned man,
but rather like a realist whom fate had blessed with a rare and
magical opportunity. As he put it, ``I'll never face Randy Johnson
again the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   What did he expect?
</P>
<P>
   ``I dunno.'' Juday's shrug said he was prepared to accept
whatever happened. ``He may strike me out on three pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wasn't thinking strikeouts as he pawed the mound and
turned his baleful gaze toward the plate, the ball hidden in his
black glove. The $50 million pitcher for the Diamondbacks wanted to
concentrate on his location, his rhythm, his timing. The velocity
of his whistling fastball gradually will increase during spring
training. Wednesday, he worked only two innings, delivering 31
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The morning of the exhibition game, UA right fielder Shelley
Duncan received a surprise telephone call from Mark McGwire. The
Wildcats cleanup hitter is the son of Dave Duncan, St. Louis
Cardinals pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire wished Duncan good luck and offered a scouting report.
``He said Randy throws 100 mph and doesn't know where it's going,''
Duncan said, and laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Fear is Johnson's ally, but the big left-hander performed his
art with care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get worried (about hitting a batter) if the guy up there is
making millions, let alone if you're a kid trying to get a college
education,'' Johnson said. The opening day pitcher for the
Diamondbacks thought about our leaders of tomorrow. ``The guy might
become the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure whether Johnson thinks his accidentally beaning a
future U.S. president could have repercussions. Who knows? Someday,
President Juday or Duncan might order the IRS to audit him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson fared better than he did the last time he pitched
against the Wildcats. In 1985, Arizona tagged him for six runs and
13 hits. Johnson played for Southern Cal.
</P>
<P>
   The playful notion that this rematch, after 14 years, would
serve as a measure of revenge amused him.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks tried to assist the collegians. Tommy Jones,
director of minor league operations, delivered a box of wooden bats
to the Wildcats with the promise that the half-dozen new sticks had
``nothing but hits in 'em.'' But the lumber malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   His heart beating with excitement, Juday willed himself to stay
calm. With his parents watching _ and the crowd calling out
``C'mon, Andy!'' _ he struck out _ on five pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan fanned, too. So did two other teammates, unable to resist
offerings that Johnson indicated were ``up here'' _ shoulder high.
Two others grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks catcher Damian Miller studied the UA hitters as
they came and went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking into their eyes, they didn't seem scared,'' Miller
said. ``Maybe awe is a better way to describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Awe is a good word. Imagine stepping into the batter's box and
locking eyes with the most intimidating pitcher in baseball. Even
from a distance of 60 feet, 6 inches, Randy Johnson atop a mound
appears bigger than life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like the Eiffel Tower,'' marveled Keoni DeRenne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 5-7.'' &QL;

START OF GAMES STIRS NEW PASSION  
 SEVERAL STORY LINES WORTH WATCHING 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Now ``this'' is Fantasy Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Affordable games. Approachable players. And the perfect
opportunity to see superstars in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Six teams begin Cactus League competition today. The
Diamondbacks meet Colorado at Tucson's Hi Corbett Field, Oakland
visits Milwaukee at Maryvale Baseball Park, and Seattle and San
Diego square off at Peoria Stadium. The rest of the league starts
play Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see certain things in the bullpen during workouts,''
Brewers pitching coach Bill Campbell said. ``But there's nothing
like getting under the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring's fans had the chance to see the talents unfold of
baseball's top rookies: Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood and Oakland
Athletics outfielder Ben Grieve. They got a firsthand look at the
charisma and skill of Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa, who went on to hit
66 home runs and help bring back fans to the game.
</P>
<P>
   They got a peek at the San Diego Padres, who would win a
franchise-record 98 games and advance to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son got Tony Gwynn's autograph here (last year),'' said Ken
Ferrell of Mission Viejo, Calif., who was watching batting practice
at Peoria Stadium on Wednesday. ``It would have been hard to do
that during the season. It meant a lot because of the season they
had.''
</P>
<P>
   What does the 1999 Cactus League season have in store? Here are
some story lines to keep in mind:
</P>
<P>
   The development of Oakland third baseman Eric Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Many have tagged him as the front-runner for American League
Rookie of the Year. The A's would love to have back-to-back
winners.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer talent of Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   The first baseman, who joined the California Angels in the
off-season, is an ironman. He played in all but one game last
season despite a variety of ailments. Imagine what he can do when
he's healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of Jose Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   For the Seattle Mariners to succeed, they need Mesa to become
the premier closer he was during his stay with Cleveland. Watching
the Mariners during late innings in recent years demanded heart
medication. Mesa should give some clues this spring to what he has.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The popular thinking is that Chicago didn't do enough in the
off-season to return to the postseason. The Cubs believe they can
return with what got them there in the first place, and that the
team just needs tweaking.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of Frank Thomas with almost no protection in the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   With the decision by the White Sox to go young and cheap (Albert
Belle and Robin Ventura are history), will Thomas be able to
rebound from a mediocre year? The odds don't look good.
</P>
<P>
   The fortunes of the Colorado Rockies with Jim Leyland as
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Fans are counting on Leyland to inspire a veteran team that many
believe underachieved the past few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Even though right-hander Darryl Kile's 13-17 record was a bit
misleading, the Rockies will need more from him to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Is there another San Diego among the 10 teams?
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about the Padres from 1998, who went on to a
successful postseason. This season's team isn't nearly as deep, and
few are predicting that San Diego will win the West.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of the teams predicted to win their divisions this
season come from the Grapefruit League. Only Anaheim seems to be
getting some respect.
</P>
<P>
   The nine remaining Cactus League teams call that fantasy, not
reality. &QL;

UA'S TERRY NAMED PLAYER OF YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Arizona point guard Jason Terry has been named National
Player of the Year in college basketball by ``Sports Illustrated''
in this week's issue.
</P>
<P>
   Terry, a 6-foot-2 senior guard who has carried the Wildcats to a
No. 13 ranking and the brink of their 15th straight NCAA Tournament
bid, joins Andre Miller of Utah, Evan Eschmeyer of Northwestern,
Elton Brand of Duke and Wally Szczerblak of Miami (Ohio) on the
``SI'' All-America first team.
</P>
<P>
   Also this week, Terry was named one of 17 finalists for the John
R. Wooden Award, presented by the Los Angeles Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a definite shot at several of these national player
of the year awards,'' UA Coach Lute Olson said. ``Some of them,
more than likely, will depend on play in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we recruited Jason there's no way I'd have said that he'd
ever average 20 points. He was not a shooter or a scorer when he
came in. Jason has had the willingness to put in the hours to
improve his shooting. He's making it a possibility that he'll be an
NBA draft lottery pick. He's certainly a lottery prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry said that he hopes to erase any doubts as to his
worthiness by leading the Wildcats on a long run into the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully I can help us play great,'' Terry said. ``Nobody
believes we can go very far. We might have a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be mentioned for these awards. Hopefully, with a
great tournament run, I'll live up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``S''I's Grant Wahl wrote that Terry, who leads the Pac-10 in
scoring (22.2), assists (5.58) and steals (2.65), received the nod
over Miller because ``no other player in the country is as crucial
to his team's success.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahl added that ``Terry's numbers are better than Miller and he
plays in a far tougher conference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' writes Wahl, ``who would you want to take your last
shot? Terry has given Arizona a tie or the lead in the last 10
seconds three times this season.''

UA HOPING TO MAKE LAST IMPRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ They've got the atlas out and are examining it closely.
</P>
<P>
   Where will the Arizona Wildcats be sent? Boston or Charlotte,
N.C., in the East Regional? Orlando or Indianapolis in the South?
Milwaukee or New Orleans in the Midwest?
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats are concerned about where they are going in more
ways than one after two convincing losses in the Bay area last
week.
</P>
<P>
   They tumbled from seventh to 13th in this week's standings.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh in the country? They'll likely be no better than fourth
or fifth in a region in the NCAA Tournament when pairings are
announced Sunday. They have an Ratings Percentage Index _ 18th _
consistent with a No. 5 seed. They're convinced they'll be shipped
out of the West, where Pac-10 champ Stanford is expected to be
assigned.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Wildcats (20-6, 11-5 Pac-10) is that
they're assured of their 15th straight NCAA Tournament berth.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that if they continue to defend as they did at
California and Stanford, their tournament stay will be a short one.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats wrap up the regular season at home at 6:30 tonight
against Southern California (14-11, 6-10) and at 1:30 p.m. Saturday
against No. 12 UCLA (21-7, 11-5). Those are opportunities to
correct deficiencies exposed last week and perhaps improve their
tournament seeding.
</P>
<P>
   Neither game, however, is a gimme. The Trojans won at Stanford
and played tight games at California and UCLA. USC was the only
Pac-10 team to beat the Wildcats last season. USC also controlled
most of the game against Arizona in Los Angeles on Jan. 4 before
the Wildcats pulled it out, 87-76.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably feel that's one we stole from them,'' UA Coach
Lute Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Bruins need no introduction. They're the only Pac-10
team with a winning record over Arizona, including an 82-75 romp in
this year's conference opener that was much worse than the score
indicates. UCLA led by more than 20 points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   So, were the Wildcats seriously overrated, and what is their
problem?
</P>
<P>
   More than likely, their ranking was a product of their
reputation. Arizona has been in the Top 10 in 30 of the past 34
polling periods, and in the Top 25 for 197 straight.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on five freshmen, three of them starters, Arizona showed
its age last week. While the youngsters now have had an entire
season to learn what college basketball is about, they still don't
know everything, particularly defensive effort, according to Olson.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA had been the only opponent to shoot at least 50 percent
against Arizona until Cal and Stanford did it last week.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive lapses on the wings, where freshmen Richard Jefferson
and Ruben Douglas play, and at power forward, where freshman
Michael Wright saw only six minutes because of foul trouble at
Stanford, were the greatest contributing factors.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had lost four games by a combined 15 points before last
week. It then lost by 13 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do something about what happened,'' center A.J.
Bramlett said. ``We had so many mental breakdowns defensively.
Stanford had guys open because of non-rotations by us, or guys not
fighting through screens.
</P>
<P>
   `We can't have those kinds of mistakes now. The good thing is
they're all fixable.''

HEDGES WEARING HARD HAT TO WORK AT WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In January, just days after Rick Neuheisel was nailed
for those against-the-NCAA-rules Sunday visits to Husky football
recruits, the new coach joined athletic director Barbara Hedges at
a Husky basketball game at Hec Ed Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel was easy enough to spot. Red-cheeked, blond-haired,
Neuheisel did not have a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he sat on the step, right on the floor next to Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   Not for one moment did any good Husky fan at Hec Ed that night
miss the obvious comparison. I mean, did anyone ever see ex-Husky
coach Jim Lambright ever sit so obediently at Hedges' feet?
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel, whose embarrassing rules violations in his first
weeks on the job made him the talk of Montlake _ and Colorado,
where he has been all but vilified _ looked exactly like a puppy in
trouble with the master.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing is, no matter how much embarrassment Neuheisel's
inaugural faux pas brought to the University of Washington, the
master said she did not spend a minute quietly cursing her newest
and very expensive hire.
</P>
<P>
   For Hedges, there are no such moments of soul-shaking doubt,
which might come as a surprise to the core group of football
diehards convinced Hedges has not demonstrated enough commitment to
that most important cornerstone program.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling was that I was very sorry that it happened,''
Hedges said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It set us back a little. He has to prove himself a little
more. Not to me, because I know he's a fine coach, but to the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is doubting that the bold about-face Hedges performed in
firing Lambright and luring golden boy Neuheisel to Montlake will
be a grand piece of her legacy _ providing Neuheisel succeeds the
way Hedges vows he will.
</P>
<P>
   Hedges knows this all too well because, even as she can be found
handing out boxed lunches to members of the sporting media in the
way she might have once fed peanut butter sandwiches to her two
sons, this is one shrewd businesswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of football will define me to an extent. It is
such a very large part of the program, that's the nature of
football,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But about that bigger picture Hedges has her vision trained on _
like the $80 million building fund that is renovating or adding
five major sports facilities at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Six years after she first began deliberating ways to upgrade
Washington's desperate facilities, the renovation of Hec Ed is set
to begin. After Saturday's Pac-10 finale between the Husky men and
Washington State, Hec Ed will undergo a $61 million upgrade, making
it the centerpiece of Hedges' Campaign for the Student Athlete
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Washington also is getting a new indoor practice facility and
crew house in addition to its new soccer, baseball and softball
fields.
</P>
<P>
   And, while some Husky football diehards might have wanted Husky
Stadium and the football program to get top billing for upgrades,
Hedges' commitment to the school's 22 other intercollegiate sports
is proved in this equitable building campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Already, under Hedges, Washington has gone from No. 47 among all
Division I schools to No. 8 last year for overall sports
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   By 2000, Washington will be the envy of Pac-10 counterparts from
Eugene to Tucson _ which is exactly the point of all this
fundraising and barn raising.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the key people around Hedges in this facilities campaign
say there are certain ingredients Hedges has brought to the job.
Vision is one. So is a background in fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she can choose people very well who can work from
disparate points of view and build a consensus,'' said Seafirst
executive Tom Powers, head of the capital campaign fundraising
group. ``She is very persistent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she deserves more credit ... although I don't know if
she'd want it,'' University booster Ron Crockett said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Crockett, like Powers, has watched Hedges since her arrival at
Washington in 1991, and both men say Hedges' competitiveness and
strength have served her well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, there were people talking about how could she head
up the athletic department when she never coached a linebacker,''
Powers said, rolling his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in becoming only the second woman to head up a Division
I athletic department when she came on board, Hedges said she has
grown used to that sort of mindset _ not that it bothers her.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she never coached a linebacker, ``but I have known a lot
of linebackers,'' Hedges said in a comedic comeback she has no
doubt used in lectures and speeches.
</P>
<P>
   She also has known football coaches _ ones that suit her and
Washington, ones that don't. In January, Hedges made a blockbuster
move with that very football program people have suggested she
might mess up.
</P>
<P>
   While Neuheisel will no doubt be the most high-profile hire
Hedges ever makes, the hire is still just a part of the bigger
picture _ a picture that appears to be putting Hedges well on her
way toward a bold legacy.

HOUSE SETTLING ON SOLID GROUND  
 GUARD HAS OVER COME SHAKY START AT ASU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Asked whether he considers this a breakthrough
year for him, Eddie House thought for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The question was meant to elicit an answer on his emergence as
a dynamic source of offense for Arizona State, as one of the
quickest guards in the Pac-10, if not the nation, as a player who
has a lot of upside, as NBA folks like to say.
</P>
<P>
   As he has all season, House chose a different direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' he said. ``It's kind of put my name out there in
a positive manner. Before, if my name was in the paper, it would be
over something that wasn't too positive, some things I'm not too
proud of. This year was kind of a way of getting back on the right
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he made the Pac-10 all-freshman team and was generally
productive his first two years, House had jumped the tracks more
than once. His mouth contributed to the outrageous total of 16
technical fouls by players last year. He scuffled with a teammate,
Bobby Lazor, during a game, and with an opponent, Arizona's A.J.
Bramlett, in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, House was arrested for allegedly helping
then-teammate Reggie Hester steal a portable CD player from a dorm
room. Although House later was cleared, the incident was the final
straw preceding the forced resignation of Coach Bill Frieder.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, House, described by all who know him as a smart
kid, was admittedly lax in the classroom. And underscoring all of
this was an attitude characterized mainly by unflattering
adjectives _ sullen, aloof, arrogant. One person involved with the
program called House ``a good kid trying to act bad.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is anything first-year Coach Rob Evans and his staff
can't stand, it's a bad actor. Which is why House's introductory
meeting with assistant coach Tony Benford began with Benford saying
something like, ``So, Eddie, how come everyone thinks you're an
(expletive)?''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, nice meeting you, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard he had some problems the previous year, and everybody
we talked to said he had an attitude problem,'' Benford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that as a staff, we were willing to give him the
benefit of the doubt. But if he didn't want to accept the rules the
coaches have in place, we'd be willing to call any school in the
country if he wanted to transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Replied House, ``This is where I signed, and this is where I
want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the meeting still jostled House. Soon, much of his family
was descending on Tempe from northern California to find out what
the heck was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``His relatives took offense,'' Evans said. ``And that's OK.
They have a right to defend Eddie and voice their opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   House owns up to some of the misdeeds, but said his personality
was misread. He said mistrust of ``some people'' was reflected in
his demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some things I shouldn't have done, but as far as
the attitude and the type of person I am and the image, it was a
big misunderstanding,'' he said. ``Once people formed those views,
it was like a snowball effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the message that Evans and the coaches were
sending was received loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to melt that snowball,'' said House, who is the
favorite player of Benford's young son, Tony Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a joy for me to coach,'' Evans said. ``I haven't had
to challenge him off the floor. He calls me when he's going to be a
little bit late, or if there's something I need to know. He takes
care of his business. On the floor, if he's not working as hard as
I think he should be working and I tell him, I guarantee you he
goes to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once has House strayed, early on, and it proved to be a
defining moment. He skipped a summer school class and was sentenced
to Evans' infamous ``5 at 5,'' which is five miles at 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were saying, `He won't show up, he won't show up,' ''
Benford said. ``And Eddie was there at 4:30 in the morning, and he
ran as hard as anybody. From that day forward we said, `This kid
wants to be here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Berkeley, Calif., near the University of California
campus, House grew up in Union City. He was a big Cal fan but was
shunned by then-head coach Todd Bozeman. That hurt, he said, and
ever since, ``I take it personally every time I play them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even ASU was a reluctant suitor until Frieder showed up for a
game and House scored 45 points. He started 22 games as a freshman
and averaged 12.6 points, playing both guard positions. He played
mostly off-guard last season under Don Newman and again scored in
double-figures, even though he was the fourth scoring option behind
Jeremy Veal, Mike Batiste and Lazor.
</P>
<P>
   This season, with Veal gone and Evans recognizing a scalding
offensive player when he sees one, the 6-foot-1 House has
flourished. Despite starting the season with a broken jaw wired
shut, he is second in the Pac-10 in scoring (19.5) going into
tonight's game against UCLA. He also averages more than three
assists and nearly five rebounds a game, and is third in the Pac-10
in steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can beat you off the dribble, he can beat you off the
catch,'' said Evans, who hopes to land House a tryout for a U.S.
amateur team this summer.
</P>
<P>
   House has worked hard on his all-around game, stepping up his
defense and his rebounding. The pros question his size, not his
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the way, off the dribble, he can get his defender
off-balance and get him to back up,'' said Dick Van Arsdale, the
Suns vice-president of player personnel. ``He's as good at that as
anyone I've seen in college ball. . . .The bottom line is, I think
he's a very good player.''
</P>
<P>
   And he can only get better next season when he's the veteran of
a young but potentially very talented team. With this season not
yet over, House sometimes has to harness his enthusiasm about the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a joy to watch,'' he said, choosing a word
rarely heard from him before. &QL;

18-YEAR-OLD AUSSIE UPSETS 2ND SEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Lleyton Hewitt turned 18 a week ago
Wednesday, and it already appears he may become the next Australian
superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, he proved once again how good he is, beating second
seed Patrick Rafter in straight sets to advance to the
quarterfinals of the Franklin Templeton Tennis Classic at the
Canadian Pacific Scottsdale Princess resort.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, the No. 5 player in the world, played tough in the first
set, losing, 7-6, on a 7-5 in a tiebreaker. In the second set,
however, Hewitt cruised to a 6-1 win.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Andre Agassi, the third seed, struggled to a
three-set victory in his first-round match, saying he was playing
not to lose rather than to win.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night was a different story when he buried Mariano
Zabaleta of Argentina, 6-2, 6-0, in a match that lasted only 50
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt won his first ATP Tour title when he was 16 years, 10
months old in Adelaide, Australia, his hometown. He was ranked
550th at the time. Along the way, he beat both Agassi and Jason
Stoltenberg, who met in last year's Franklin Templeton final. He
currently is ranked 91st.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous meeting with Rafter on Jan. 12 in Sydney, Hewitt
also won in straight sets, 7-6 (7-1), 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's victory, Hewitt was jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels fantastic to beat him again,'' he said. ``It proved
it wasn't a fluke the first time. And it was great to beat him in
straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also feels good to have won away from Australia. This is my
first big one.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt is 9-3 this year and has been to the quarterfinals in
three of four tournaments. He won only 10 matches last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to get a little confidence,'' he said. ``My
ranking hasn't been good enough to get into many big tournaments.
This is much better than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know more about the ATP, how to handle myself. You have
be tough against the big guys. You have to play your game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt will play his quarterfinal match Friday against Jerome
Golmard of France.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter was complimentary after his loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Hewitt) plays a good game and doesn't make too many
mistakes,'' he said. ``I needed to take more chances, and I
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter said a lack of work has hurt his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't played many matches,'' Rafter said. ``This year I
won't be playing as many tournaments as last year. I want to enjoy
myself, and if I work hard, it will come.''
</P>
<P>
   If history is an indication, Agassi is in good shape to win this
tournament. When he has advanced beyond the second round, he has
won the title all three times _ 1993, '94 and '98.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi has lost the fewest games in this tournament since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was better tonight,'' he said. ``Different players play
different ways. Yesterday (Tuesday) it was a lefty. It was harder
to size up his shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day is a new one. I was really hitting the ball. I'm
satisfied with everything I did tonight. Well, I can serve
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi will play Cedric Pioline of France in Friday's
quarterfinals. &QL;

   Defending doubles champions  &UR; Cyril Suk and  &UR; Michael Tebbutt, who
are unseeded this year in the Franklin Templeton Tennis Classic,
won their first-round match Wednesday with a 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory
over  &UR; Pablo Albano and  &UR; Daniel
 &UR; Orsanic.
</P>
<P>
   Tebbutt, 28 and an Australian, was an All-America tennis player
at Northern Arizona University in 1992-93 before he turned pro. He
has won a total of almost $1 million in his pro career. &QL; 
French advance &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-seeded  &UR; Cedric Pioline and  &UR; Jerome Golmard, both of
France, were the first to advance to the singles quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Pioline, playing in Scottsdale for the first time, easily beat
 &UR; Andrew Ilie, 6-1, 6-2, and Golmard, who was trailing 3-5 in the
first set, advanced when qualifier  &UR; Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador
retired with an ankle sprain. &QL; 
Rafter sinking &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Patrick Rafter's fortunes seem to be sinking in competition
with fellow Australians.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, ranked fifth in the world and the second seed in this
tournament, won seven straight matches against his countrymen from
the beginning of 1997 through May of that year.
</P>
<P>
   But from June '97 through Wednesday's matches, when he was
eliminated by Australian  &UR; Lleyton Hewitt, he is 4-6. &QL;

MOISO'S FEET NO LONGER ARCH ENEMY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ All the advice, all medical technology and
advanced treatments available at UCLA, and what freshman forward
Jerome Moiso really needed was a dabble of over-the-counter
ointment to help his tender feet.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's game against Washington, a friend introduced
Moiso to the magic of heat-generating sports cream. It immediately
eased the pain from tendinitis in his arches. Moiso felt good for
the first time in weeks and played like it _ 11 points and six
rebounds in 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ointment warmed my feet, so I didn't feel any pain,''
Moiso said. ``Saturday was the first time I tried it, and it worked
pretty well. It was almost like I felt a month ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Moiso's confidence is as tender as his feet. The tendinitis
flared in early February and disrupted his rhythm. That caused him
to miss shots, which hurt his confidence, and the spiral continued.
He was 1 of 12 at Stanford before missing two games (Cal, USC). He
played a few minutes against Syracuse and Washington State, then he
met the ointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend said I'd feel no pain,'' Moiso said. ``Now, I use it
for every practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The more he practices, the better he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``His timing and rhythm are back,'' coach Steve Lavin said.
``He's in the offensive flow, and with that he's getting confident
and aggressive. But (without injured center Dan Gadzuric), we can't
pin it all on his shoulders. We have to do it collectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior commitment: Moiso, a native of Guadeloupe who was educated
in France, said he probably won't play for the French national team
in the European championships this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They start practice in mid-May, and I have school until
mid-June,'' he said. ``I'd like to play, but the team will have
been practicing hard and to come in late would not be right.''
</P>
<P>
   Firepower: Arizona State has the best trio of scorers in the
Pac-10, with guard Eddie House and forwards Mike Batiste and Bobby
Lazor combining for 54 points per game. Lazor and House probably
will make the all-conference team (to be announced this weekend).
</P>
<P>
   ``They have three players who are all capable of getting 30,''
Lavin said. ``If they have one of those nights, it'll be tough on
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiny does it: Gadzuric grabbed 14 rebounds in 18 minutes in the
first Arizona State game, but the Bruins were most effective
without him on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   In Batiste and Lazor, the Sun Devils have two 6-8 forwards but
no center, and they pose a difficult matchup for opposing big men.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first game, our smaller lineup (was more effective),''
Lavin said. ``It was similar to Oregon and the Taiwan national
team. All year, we've had a difficult time with small teams.''

<P>
   PHOENIX - Northern Arizona men's basketball Coach Ben Howland
has accepted the head coaching position at the University of
Pittsburgh, sources close to both schools confirmed late Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Howland would not comment Wednesday night. He was traveling to
Ogden, Utah, today with his team for the Big Sky Conference
Tournament. He interviewed with Pittsburgh earlier this week and
was the only candidate for the job.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers likely won't introduce Howland as their next coach
until at least Monday. Sources in Pittsburgh said they wanted to
wait until NAU's season was over to give Howland a chance to get
the Lumberjacks in the NCAA Tournament for the second consecutive
year. The winner of this weekend's Big Sky Conference Tournament
earns an automatic bid to the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt lost to Rutgers, 64-51, in the first round of the Big East
Tournament on Wednesday night in Coach Ralph Willard's last game.
Willard went 63-82 in five seasons at Pitt. This season Pitt was
14-16 overall and 5-13 in the Big East for an 11th-place finish. He
had one winning season in his five there.
</P>
<P>
   Howland, 40, is going to a job that pays him nearly four times
the the $110,000 package he earns at NAU. His name first surfaced
at Pitt a week ago when Panthers Athletic Director Steve Pederson
went to Flagstaff to interview him. Howland was recommended by
several high-profile coaches, including Utah's Rick Majerus, a
close friend of Howland. Last Sunday, Howland then flew to
Pittsburgh to meet with school officials and tour the campus. But
he wasn't offered the job until Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   NAU Athletic Director Steve Holton said there was nothing to
announce but acknowledged that the university is in the preliminary
stages of a search for a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   Expected to head that list is former NAU and current Hawaii
assistant Jamie Dixon, who has already inquired about the job. But
Holton said it's too early to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not far enough along to narrow the list down to four or
five guys yet, but he is definitely somebody we're considering,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holton said Howland's success should help in the search for a
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are going to see this program has the ability
to be successful and compete not only in the Big Sky, but also at
the national level.'' he said. ``Ben has brought in a talented
group of young players, and a new coach could step right in and not
have to rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   Howland took over a perennial Big Sky cellar dweller and has led
NAU to a 75-57 record in five seasons. He led the Lumberjacks to
regular-season conference titles in 1997 and 1998 and the NCAA
Tournament in '98. This year's Lumberjacks are 20-7 and finished
second in the Big Sky. They will play at 7 p.m. Friday against a
team to be determined tonight. &QL;

QUINT SHOWS HE BELONGS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - During the preseason, it appeared he was on the
trading block. Four teams were rumored to be in the chase. But with
each passing week and every month that followed, it became clear
that Coyotes defenseman  &UR; Deron Quint wasn't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Except to a new position, left wing, which he has played for the
past five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big difference in the positions, but as long as I'm out
there, I'm happy,'' said Quint, who scored a goal, his third,
during the Coyotes' 3-2 loss in Boston on Tuesday. ``I'm definitely
not complaining about the ice time. Playing with JR  &UR; (Jeremy
Roenick) and  &UR; (Rick) Tocchet, there's not much that can go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Quint's days as a forward could be numbered, however. Although
Quint has done reasonably well at the position, left wing  &UR; Greg
Adams could be back Friday against the visiting Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Adams has missed the past week because of a pulled groin muscle,
but he has been skating on his own and is ready to return. &QL; 
The untouchables &QL; 
A bunch of the Coyotes' game-high 51 hits left some of the Bruins
bitter with seemingly every other check. A couple in particular by
Roenick and  &UR; Keith &UR; Tkachuk steamed Boston players like a piping hot
plate of clams.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk lined up  &UR; Anson Carter with a clean hit, which  &UR; Jason
Allison instantly took exception with, and the two high-priced
forwards dropped the gloves and duked it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to dish it out, they're going to have to take
it, too,'' Allison said. ``A lot of those guys, they think they're
untouchable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind if he fights Tkachuk,'' Bruins Coach  &UR; Pat Burns
said. &UR; ``I don't want him fighting bozos. If he's going to fight,
fight the Tkachuks, fight the Roenicks, but don't bother with these
Quint guys and these  &UR; (Shane) Doan guys.'' &QL; 
Slap shots &QL; 
Detroit Red Wings forward  &UR; Sergei Fedorov has been suspended for
five games without pay for slashing the New York Islanders'  &UR; Zdeno
Chara during Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov will lose $386,178 in pay. His suspension begins Friday
against the Coyotes and ends March 17 when the Coyotes visit
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov has been classified as a repeat offender, given that he
was suspended for two games on March 26 for a hit from behind on
 &UR; Jason Marshall of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Center  &UR; Rob Murray has been sent back to Springfield. Murray was
a healthy scratch Tuesday. &QL;

TOP USC RECRUIT HAS SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USC's top basketball recruit, Nate Hair of Capistrano Valley
High, underwent arthroscopic knee surgery Wednesday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery was performed at USC University Hospital by Dr.
Thomas Vangsness. Hair damaged the meniscus in his knee during
Capistrano Valley's playoff opener against Yucaipa two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   USC officials did not know how long Hair would be sidelined, but
the shooting guard's injury is not considered serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a career-threatening surgery,'' Capistrano Valley
coach Brian Mulligan said. ``It's a meniscus problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries to the meniscus usually require four to eight weeks of
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine honored: Sophomore center Brian Scalabrine was named
the Pacific-10 Conference's Newcomer of the Year on Wednesday.
Scalabrine leads USC in points (14.9), rebounds (6.5) and
field-goal percentage (53 percent). He is also second in assists
(2.4) and third in blocks (0.8).
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian came in and outplayed every big guy we had,'' USC coach
Henry Bibby said. ``If you looked at who graded highest at every
practice since October, the two best players have been Brian and
Jeff Trepagnier.''
</P>
<P>
   Also named to the team were guards Josh Steinthal of Oregon
State, Alex Scales and Darius Wright of Oregon and Jan-Michael
Thomas of Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine is the second USC player to win the award in the last
three seasons. Rodrick Rhodes won in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As for Scalabrine, he is expected to play tonight against
Arizona after recovering from food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of the defense: Although some USC players said the
Trojans are just now fully grasping all aspects of the team's
defensive schemes, Bibby said he doesn't believe the defensive
plays have been too complex this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense is not complicated,'' Bibby said. ``There's just
too many new faces. It's a matter of buying into and accepting what
you want them to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the field? USC may be unsure of its chances of making the
National Invitation Tournament, but one mock field already includes
the Trojans. Of course, that's before this week's games. USC would
greatly improve its chances of making the tournament with a win
against Arizona in the McKale Center, where the Wildcats are 12-0
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a win there would be great,'' Bibby said. ``What are
the odds of us going in there and winning? If you're a gambler, it
doesn't look good. But how many people thought we would win at
Stanford?''

LEYLAND PHILOSOPHY TRANSCENDS TIME  
 `I WANT TO BEAT THE OTHER TEAM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ The term ``old school'' is tossed around often
these days. It's used to describe just about anyone who gets dirty
while doing his job.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's not warranted. In Jim Leyland's case, it's the
best possible description for someone who could have managed in any
era. Step into the office of the Colorado Rockies' new skipper and
it's like walking back 30 or 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   He charges through his cigarette, not caring that each one he
pulls out of the soft pack is crumpled and bent. Next to his
ashtray, a clubhouse attendant makes sure he has a fresh cup of
decaffeinated coffee.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular morning, he downs three cups in a 20-minute
period before his wife calls and he answers with his western
Pennsylvania accent, ``How yous doin'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not into this to pick up a paycheck,'' Leyland said. ``I
feel no different now than when I played for $400 a month; I want
to beat the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone doubts Leyland's sincerity when he talks of not
caring about the money. The reality, however, is that Leyland has
risen to the top of his profession. In turn, he has become the
highest-paid manager in the game, earning about $2 million per year
from Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most players, over the course of their careers, have talked
very favorably of him,'' said Diamondbacks shortstop Jay Bell, who
played eight seasons for Leyland in Pittsburgh. ``His reputation is
to be somebody who allows his players to play. He gives all the
credit when his team wins and takes all the blame when they lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He relates so well to everyone he comes across. On a daily
basis, he probably has 40 different relationships. It's amazing how
Jim and Buck (Showalter) are so closely related. They have
different personalities, but if you go below the surface to their
baseball minds, they are almost identical.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies made hardly any changes with their roster over the
winter, believing the club they assembled last season (one that was
predicted by many to win the National League West) was not far from
being able to wedge its way into the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, other than the additions of pitcher Brian Bohanon and
superb utility player Lenny Harris, the Rockies look almost
identical to the club that finished 77-85 and 21 games behind NL
West champion San Diego under Don Baylor, who managed Colorado
during its first six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   While Baylor was made a bit of a scapegoat for the Rockies'
floundering season in 1998, Colorado owner Jerry McMorris stepped
in after the season and made Leyland his top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he allowed Leyland to assume more control of the
club than Baylor ever enjoyed. Leyland's first order of business
when the Rockies opened their spring camp two weeks ago was to
submit his list of no-nonsense personal rules:
</P>
<P>
   1. Make sure you are always on time.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bust your butt whenever you are on the field.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. No more, no less.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tells you what he wants and he keeps it simple,'' Colorado
center fielder Darryl Hamilton said. ``He trusts you. He knows by
this time, we should know what's right from wrong. He's definitely
old school. Like every good manager, he puts his pride aside.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be Leyland's 14th season of guiding a club: eleven
with Pittsburgh and two with Florida. He has taken four different
clubs to the postseason, finally winning it all with the Marlins in
1997. He also managed a depleted and torn-apart Florida club to 108
losses last season. Yet surprisingly, he took great pride in his
job last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very humbling experience,'' Leyland said from his
cramped office at Hi Corbett Field. ``But last year was one of the
best groups of players I've ever had. Don't get me wrong, I didn't
feel good about losing 108 games, but we took a good core of kids
who will wind up being fine big-league players.''
</P>
<P>
   Like players, Leyland thrives on the competition. Though he
never made it as a major league player, the burning desire to
compete has never escaped him. It was the overriding reason he left
Pittsburgh (his home) after yet another losing season in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Friends in the game were in Leyland's ear, reminding him how
competing in Pittsburgh (at least at that time) was nowhere in the
Pirates immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easiest thing I could have done was to stay in
Pittsburgh,'' he said. ``I was stale in Pittsburgh after 11 years.
They used to ask me, `You want a chance to win, don't you?' I'm no
different than anybody else. I want to win.''

WILLIAMS STRIKES LOCO NOTE OVER M'S PITCHING STAFF 
</HEADLINE>

   PEORIA, Ariz. _ At 6-foot-5, Stan Williams is a little closer to
the sun than most. In Seattle, that makes no difference, because
the Mariners play inside. Even when they move outside, local clouds
are denser than Kingdome concrete.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, however, extra altitude is apparently a liability.
</P>
<P>
   As the pitching coach approached his charges on the practice
field Wednesday morning, he boomed out, ``Hello, my beauties!'' to
one of the more beleaguered staffs in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion that the man's cerebrum has been sun-dried was
confirmed when he offered up this observation about the presumptive
closer this season, newcomer Jose Mesa:
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty saves for him is not out of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it _ proof of the deleterious consequences of the
sun. Stay away from here, Puget Sounders. As every cowboy or miner
in every Western movie has always warned, the desert makes you
loco.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a possibility Williams is right about Mesa,
who saved 46 games for Cleveland in 1995. If that proves true,
Williams will become the next mayor of Seattle, a guest on
Letterman and Leno and cover boy for Magicians Monthly magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Stan, my man, regarding Seattle pitching forecasts, skepticism
runs deep.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, manager Lou Piniella was convinced his relief corps
was better than the critics claimed. Turned out the most expensive
bullpen in baseball ($8.9 million in '98 salaries) was even more
costly, finishing next to last in the team relief standings that
measure saves and wins against blowns saves and losses. And then it
lost to free agency Mike Timlin, whose seasonal second half
bordered on the superlative.
</P>
<P>
   So now Williams is asking us to believe that the Mariners have
found more than Timlin's equivalent, for about half Timlin's cost.
Williams might have an easier time this morning selling irrigation
systems in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his makeup, his workmanlike attitude and self-control,
and he's easy to talk to,'' Williams insisted, sincerity burning
from his eyes into the inquisitor's. ``Mesa looks outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is equally buoyant about the other spot that is
critical to Mariner pitching fortunes, the No. 3 starter. In his
first full season a year ago, Ken Cloude had one of the poorer
efforts by a major league pitcher, going 8-10 with a 6.37 ERA.
Baseball Weekly calculated that Cloude's on-base percentage and
slugging percentage added together was the highest in baseball for
a starter with more than 75 innings.
</P>
<P>
   No team can be a contender without consistent quality innings
from the third man in the rotation, particularly on a staff that
failed to replace No. 1 starter Randy Johnson. The fourth and fifth
spots are a crapshoot, here as well as with many other teams.
</P>
<P>
   So if Cloude, 24, doesn't deliver behind Jeff Fassero and Jamie
Moyer, the new ballpark will quickly become the world's second-most
expensive tomb, behind the pyramids of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've ironed out his principal problem, and Ken is
going to be fine,'' Williams said. ``He had an outstanding game at
the end of last season, after we made the adjustment. He's going to
be the Kenny Cloude we were looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloude's mechanical trouble stemmed from a habit of holding the
glove near his face before releasing the ball. It caused him to
limit his arm extension, and thus short-arm the pitch. Williams
gave Piniella credit for spotting the flaw.
</P>
<P>
   With the glove now coming to rest at his waist before delivery,
``it allows me a full arc with my arm,'' Cloude said. ``I'm
pitching much more relaxed and effortlessly. It's made a
significant change in locating the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether fans buy Williams' optimism about the two pivot points
on the Mariner staff is secondary to whether the pitchers buy it.
Right now, the sale is made.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his predecessor, Piniella's Bible-study pal, Nardi
Contreras, Williams has his players' full attention and respect.
Since this is his first spring camp under Piniella (Williams came
on when Contreras was fired 11 games into last season), he has made
a point of introducing his old-school, yet upbeat style to
youngsters and vets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more like a father, and he's pretty calm and subtle,''
said Billy Swift. ``And he's been there,'' referring to Williams'
14-year major league pitching career that ended in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptical view is that since Williams is the fourth pitching
coach in seven years under Piniella, he's merely the next
scapegoat-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest counterpoint Williams, 62, offers is his deep
friendship with Piniella, 55, that was helpful in bringing them a
World Series ring with the Cincinnati Reds in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Lou almost since he was a baby. We've been friends
a long time. We have a good rapport,'' he said. ``Lou can be very
tough. He wants to win so badly, that's why I like him so much.
He's also big-hearted, an emotional guy. Sometimes things come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I try to let it slide and discuss things after he quiets
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Any success Williams has in keeping Piniella from hijacking the
soul out of a young pitcher in the event of a walk will be a signal
accomplishment, almost as heady as restoring the No. 3 starter or
the bullpen closer.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams can't get any of those things done, well, he's
already desert loco, so the season shouldn't bother him.

NAU'S HOWLAND ACCEPTS POSITION WITH PITTSBURGH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - Northern Arizona men's basketball Coach Ben Howland
has accepted the head coaching position at the University of
Pittsburgh, sources close to both schools confirmed late Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Howland would not comment Wednesday night. He was traveling to
Ogden, Utah, today with his team for the Big Sky Conference
Tournament. He interviewed with Pittsburgh earlier this week and
was the only candidate for the job.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers likely won't introduce Howland as their next coach
until at least Monday. Sources in Pittsburgh said they wanted to
wait until NAU's season was over to give Howland a chance to get
the Lumberjacks in the NCAA Tournament for the second consecutive
year. The winner of this weekend's Big Sky Conference Tournament
earns an automatic bid to the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt lost to Rutgers, 64-51, in the first round of the Big East
Tournament on Wednesday night in Coach Ralph Willard's last game.
Willard went 63-82 in five seasons at Pitt. This season Pitt was
14-16 overall and 5-13 in the Big East for an 11th-place finish. He
had one winning season in his five there.
</P>
<P>
   Howland, 40, is going to a job that pays him nearly four times
the the $110,000 package he earns at NAU. His name first surfaced
at Pitt a week ago when Panthers Athletic Director Steve Pederson
went to Flagstaff to interview him. Howland was recommended by
several high-profile coaches, including Utah's Rick Majerus, a
close friend of Howland. Last Sunday, Howland then flew to
Pittsburgh to meet with school officials and tour the campus. But
he wasn't offered the job until Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   NAU Athletic Director Steve Holton said there was nothing to
announce but acknowledged that the university is in the preliminary
stages of a search for a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   Expected to head that list is former NAU and current Hawaii
assistant Jamie Dixon, who has already inquired about the job. But
Holton said it's too early to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not far enough along to narrow the list down to four or
five guys yet, but he is definitely somebody we're considering,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holton said Howland's success should help in the search for a
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are going to see this program has the ability
to be successful and compete not only in the Big Sky, but also at
the national level.'' he said. ``Ben has brought in a talented
group of young players, and a new coach could step right in and not
have to rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   Howland took over a perennial Big Sky cellar dweller and has led
NAU to a 75-57 record in five seasons. He led the Lumberjacks to
regular-season conference titles in 1997 and 1998 and the NCAA
Tournament in '98. This year's Lumberjacks are 20-7 and finished
second in the Big Sky. They will play at 7 p.m. Friday against a
team to be determined tonight. &QL;

JOHNSON SATISFIED WITH 1ST SPRING OUTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ This was big. The table full of microphones indicated
so. The crowd of reporters, waiting to devour every morsel of
information, was another sign.
</P>
<P>
   On  &UR; Randy Johnson's grand scale, however, his first pitching
assignment for the Diamondbacks on Wednesday against the University
of Arizona was tame by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting to be out there, but not nearly as exciting as
it will be in LA for the opener (on April 5 against the Dodgers and
right-hander  &UR; Kevin
 &UR; Brown) or the first time I pitch at Bank One Ballpark (likely April
15 against the Dodgers),'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander pitched the first two innings of the
Diamondbacks' 10-2 victory over the Wildcats at Tucson Electric
Park. He didn't give up a hit and struck out four of the six men he
faced. His pitch speed averaged 93 mph and topped at 95.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just working on my location, mechanics and trying to get a
feel for my breaking ball, but it usually doesn't come until late
spring,'' Johnson said. ``I want to show improvement, but I don't
base what kind of year I'm going to have on what I do in the
spring.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Damian Miller enjoyed his first opportunity to catch Johnson in
game conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching him on TV, you would think he would be hard to catch,
but he's really not,'' said Miller, who never faced Johnson when
both were in the American League or last season after Johnson was
traded to Houston on July 31. ``Once he finds his release point,
it's right there. He shook me off a few times, but I'm sure we'll
get used to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bulldog out there. Once he gets going, it's `Here it
is, boys, see if you can hit it.' There ain't no messing around.''
</P>
<P>
   It was mentioned to Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter that Johnson
occasionally grunts when he throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I heard that grunt one too many times,'' Showalter said,
referring to the times when Johnson, then with Seattle, squared off
against his New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's next scheduled start is Sunday against the Chicago
White Sox at Tucson Electric Park. After throwing 31 pitches
Wednesday, he likely will throw closer to 50 on Sunday. If Johnson
needs more work after leaving the game, he will throw on the side. &QL; 
Womack Mfg. Co. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New acquisition  &UR; Tony Womack was the designated hitter Wednesday
and struck out in his first plate appearance, but later showed why
the Diamondbacks wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, he led off and reached base on a bunt
single, stole second, went to third on single by  &UR; Edwin Diaz and
scored on a double-play grounder by  &UR; Dante Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said Womack will not play in today's Cactus League
opener against the Colorado Rockies, but will remain at Tucson
Electric Park to work on fundamentals related to his switch from
second base to right field. &QL; 
Robinson services &QL; 
Funeral services for Diamondbacks minor league pitcher  &UR; Ken
Robinson, who was killed early Sunday in a Tucson auto accident,
will be Friday in Jacksonville, Fla. The family has requested that
in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to an education fund for
Robinson's 1-year-old son, &UR; Chase. Address is Nations Bank Florida,
14288 Beach Boulevard, Jacksonville, FL 32250-1546. The account
number is 0030-6265-0521. &QL;

BODINE SPEAKS, AND THE SECRET IS OUT ABOUT TMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geoffrey Bodine said the secret words without prompting Tuesday
afternoon at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those moments where you're glad you had your tape
recorder rolling, inconspicuously under a notepad, just to make
sure you had heard what you had written down, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this track right now definitely has the potential for
side-by-side racing,'' Bodine said into the tape recorder, above
the din of a screaming NASCAR Winston Cup engine. ``That's what
race fans want to see and that's what we want to do as drivers,
because that's how we pass people. We get beside 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   And race 'em, side-by-side.
</P>
<P>
   Other than, ``Turn 1 isn't leaking any more, guys,'' no nicer
words have been spoken lately about the racetrack in far north Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   In 24 days, TMS is scheduled to play host to its third annual
Winston Cup race. During Tuesday's media intrusion into Cup testing
at the 1.5-mile quad-oval, we learned that Bodine unofficially had
blown the doors off the track-qualifying record a day earlier.
Bodine also felt comfortable enough with the revised layout to
state that he and his Winston Cup brethren will be able to race
door handle-to-door handle on Palm Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Recall that after the water seepage problems experienced in
turns 1 and 4 during Cup qualifying last year, and continued
complaints about the track's ``one-groove'' geometry, developer
Bruton Smith and general manager Eddie Gossage had the track ripped
up, reconfigured and repaved. The $3 million redesign eliminated
the controversial 8-degree ``dual-banking'' from the turns, leaving
the track with true 24-degree banked corners.
</P>
<P>
   And the promise of two grooves.
</P>
<P>
   Rising series star Jeremy Mayfield set the Winston Cup
qualifying record last year with a hot lap in 29.047
seconds/185.906 mph in the No. 12 Mobil 1 Ford Taurus. On Monday,
Bodine unofficially toured the track in 28.72 seconds, or 188.022
mph. Bodine's lap is a whopping 2.116 mph faster than Mayfield's,
but, because it was recorded during a test, the numbers remain
unofficial.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bodine said the lap was run under qualifying-type
conditions. Assuming that Bodine's No. 60 Power Team Chevrolet
Monte Carlo also would have passed NASCAR tech inspection, and the
numbers are even close to legit, speeds should take a significant
jump at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The shape of the ``new'' TMS is not the only factor in play
here. NASCAR also has ditched the controversial ``5-and-5''
aerodynamics package, giving the three car manufacturers taller
rear spoilers and lower front air dams to help increase stability
everywhere, but especially through the corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there's one groove here that's really fast,'' said
Bodine, who spent Tuesday refining a race-day setup. ``When we get
here and get racing, the groove will move up, and I think you'll
have two grooves out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Two grooves. Side-by-side racing. Passing for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Bodine has spoken. And it's all down on tape.
</P>
<P>
   LAJOIE TESTS WINSTON CUP CAR
</P>
<P>
   Randy LaJoie admittedly misses the perks accompanying the title
of NASCAR Busch Grand National champion, a cache not limited to a
steady supply of six packs courtesy of the series title sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   LaJoie simply loves the drive-hard, party-hearty BGN lifestyle _
one that he parlayed into series championships in 1996 and 1997.
LaJoie failed in his bid for a third consecutive title in 1998,
when he ran into a couple of upstarts named Dale Earnhardt Jr. and
Matt Kenseth.
</P>
<P>
   But an off-season change of teams and a victory in the season
opener at Daytona International Speedway on Feb. 13 have allowed
LaJoie to re-invent himself as the series points leader after two
of 32 events. He will take a 10-point lead over Kenseth into the
Sam's Town 300 on Saturday at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, secure that
team owner James Finch and Phoenix Racing are committed to chasing
the 1999 BGN championship.
</P>
<P>
   Then what was LaJoie doing at Texas Motor Speedway this week,
testing a Winston Cup car? A Ford Taurus, yet? And hanging out with
road racer Boris Said?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm coaching,'' said LaJoie, moments after stepping out of an
unpainted version of the No. 14 Federated Auto Parts Ford. ``I'm
here kind of as a coach and mentor to shake the cars down and help
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The team is co-owned by Cup regular Ernie Irvan and associate
Mark Simo, who are attempting to execute the transition of Said
from NASCAR's Craftsman Truck Series to Winston Cup as quickly as
possible. Irvan-Simo have plotted an eight-race Cup schedule for
Said, beginning with the Primestar 500 in Fort Worth on March 28.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule includes the Winston Cup road races at Sonoma,
Calif., and Watkins Glen, N.Y., where Said is expected to qualify
well and excel. Running the six ovals, however, will hinge upon
Said's progress at turning left in a 750-horsepower Cup car.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be perfectly honest, I don't have the experience to be out
here racing Cup,'' said Said, who racked up a second-place finish
in the inaugural NASCAR Truck race at TMS in June 1997. ``We need
some experience, and he's \RLaJoie\S the best guy we could have
got.''
</P>
<P>
   LaJoie said he has not committed to run for Irvan-Simo, mainly
because he does not want to jeopardize his BGN relationship _ and
an expanded research and development role _ with Chevrolet. But the
prospect of testing and racing Cup cars, and transferring that
knowledge to his BGN program, intrigues LaJoie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ultimate goal is the championship,'' LaJoie said. ``I've
won 'em. I know how to win 'em. I want to get back to being
competitive, that's the biggest thing.''

renewal deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $235 to $345, which is approximately half of
what some scalpers on various Web sites are asking for tickets just
to the combined NASCAR Busch Grand National and Winston Cup weekend
March 27-28. All the season seats are in the frontstretch

FORMULA ONE RETURNS
</P>
<P>
   Mika Hakkinen of Finland apparently has grown to like his
lifestyle as reigning Formula One World Driving Champion over the
past four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hungry like no tomorrow. I tell you, I really want to
win,'' said Hakkinen, who begins defense of his title at the
Australian Grand Prix on Sunday. Speedvision is scheduled to carry
the race live at 8:30 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hakkinen, who won eight of 16 races last year for West
McLaren/Mercedes, again is teamed with David Coulthard of Scotland.
They are expected to battle Ferrari's Michael Schumacher, a
two-time world champion from Germany, and Eddie Irvine of Ireland
for F1 supremacy.
NEWMAN/HAAS SWAPS TIRES
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone struck a major blow in the Championship
Auto Racing Teams ``tire wars'' earlier this week, when Newman/Haas
Racing announced it was ending its association with Goodyear after
16 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers Michael Andretti and Christian Fittipaldi will run their
Swift/Ford V-8s on Firestone Firehawks beginning with the CART
FedEx Championship Series opener on March 21 at Homestead, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti scored his series-leading 37th career victory on
Goodyears at Homestead last year. But it was Goodyear's only
victory in 19 CART races.
FIRST FOR MOPAR
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kinser became the first Sprint Car driver to win a Pennzoil
World of Outlaw ``A'' main event with Mopar power at Manzanita
Speedway in Phoenix, Ariz., on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from Chrysler's parts division announced a
multiyear sponsorship agreement with car owner Karl Kinser, Mark's
father, at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kinser finished ahead of cousin and 15-time WoO champion
Steve Kinser in the third race of 1999. Danny Lasoski is leading
the points standings after three consecutive top-five finishes.
GALLES LANDS SPONSOR
</P>
<P>
   Car owner Rick Galles' gamble of running the Pep Boys Indy
Racing League season opener without a major sponsor has paid off.
Galles' revived team, featuring two-time points runner-up Davey
Hamilton, has signed Big Daddy's BBQ as primary sponsor for their G
Force/Aurora for the remaining 10 IRL races.
LAST WORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've been to New York, you know it's not going to happen
in Manhattan _ unless they're going to take Central Park out of the
way. I don't think they're going to do that for a racetrack.''

DREDGING UP MEMORIES  
 BUCKHORN CREEK MAY BE DRY NOW, BUT TRACES REMAIN OF A GOLDEN ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even with extremely dry conditions, trips into the desert at
this time of year still are beautiful. Few grasses are growing, but
other vegetation is green and pretty.
</P>
<P>
   But beware. Temperatures already are above average. If history
is any indication, we could have temperatures in the high 90s by
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   And unless you're a hardy soul, hot days aren't much fun for
outback travel. Even with an air-conditioned vehicle, there are the
perils of overheating or a breakdown that would leave you to your
own devices in unforgiving heat.
</P>
<P>
   But now, traveling is wonderful _ on warm, spring-like days with
cloudless skies.
</P>
<P>
   That leads us to a trip that doesn't require a four-wheel-drive
vehicle, but does require one with high clearance. And there will
be some driving in sand, so don't take this trip lightly.
</P>
<P>
   The scenery is great, there's a chance to hike in a lovely
riparian area between two steep hills and you can see the remnants
of a strange gold-mining operation _ one that is something like
panning for gold in a huge way.
</P>
<P>
   The trip begins in Wickenburg, northwest of Phoenix on U.S. 60,
simply because it's easier to find this route than by starting at
the other end.
</P>
<P>
   Before you reach downtown Wickenburg, turn right on El Recreo
Road, which leads to Constellation Road. This unpaved but decent
road heads toward the ruins of the famous Constellation Mine, but
you don't go that far.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 miles in, you'll see a junction to the right. A sign
points to Owl Springs Ranch. Turn right, and you'll be heading onto
a road that will head down to Buckhorn Creek, which is dry. You'll
drive along and through Buckhorn. This is where the most adventure
lies. Finally, you'll hit Castle Creek and take a right.
</P>
<P>
   This is most difficult part of the trip. There's plenty of sand,
and the road is rough. When you leave the creek, you'll take a
short jog to the left on Morristown Road and turn right on Castle
Hot Springs Road, which will take you past the famous former resort
called Castle Hot Springs Ranch and back to State Route 74 near
Lake Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   You have to look for it, but gazing high into the hills, you'll
get a chance to see the buildings at Owl Springs Ranch. The ranch
is in a spectacular setting on a desert mountain. The view from
there must be fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   But the fun doesn't start until dropping down into Buckhorn
Creek. The roads all are rough from now on.
</P>
<P>
   Down the creek a short distance, you'll encounter a small
concrete structure along the road on the right. Turn into the
driveway there for a pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The old ranch house that was built against a hillside is gone,
but things remain that are even more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   This is Buckhorn Springs, and you'll quickly encounter a couple
of water troughs kept full by the springs. The troughs are fed by
gravity from pools higher above through plastic pipe. The pipe must
have some small leaks because the larger trough burbles with air
that is released with the water.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the pipe up along the mostly dry stream created by the
springs. The scenery is terrific _ rock cliffs, trees, plants and
ultimately pools of water. It's an easy walk along the stream bed.
The pipe is buried in one pool. The springs are higher above.
</P>
<P>
   This is a great place to stop for lunch (and carry out your
trash).
</P>
<P>
   Now travel farther down the road, and suddenly you'll encounter
a huge piece of machinery in the middle of the dry streambed among
vegetation that has grown up around it.
</P>
<P>
   It appears to be a huge pontoon boat sitting on the rocks and
sand. In a way, it is. But this was a working boat, a gold dredge.
Though they're gone now, the boat appeared to have had a diesel
engine and large pump. Two 20- to 30-foot steel pipes rise above
the dredge.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently this is how it worked: The stream was dammed when it
was flowing, creating a small lake to float the dredge. The steel
pipes were rammed into the bed to keep the dredge stable.
</P>
<P>
   Gold particles would settle out in the lake and could be dredged
from the bottom. The pump also could spray a strong stream of water
on the shoreline, bringing more gold-bearing sediment into the
lake.
</P>
<P>
   It seems impossible that the dredge could have been brought to
this site in one piece. It must have been constructed on site. It's
impressive to see.
</P>
<P>
   A short distance downstream, a side road to the right reveals a
metal scow tangled among the trees. At one time the scow, a
ponderous thing, had a hand winch with cable that was attached to
the dredge and shoreline. It allowed travel between the two sites.
</P>
<P>
   Farther up this side road, one can see remnants of more recent
gold-mining operations.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing was fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   There is another abandoned ranch on the way out, but it is
posted with no trespassing signs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's always a pleasure to drive past Castle Hot
Springs Ranch with it's well-kept lawn and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   This was an interesting adventure for a warm March day. &QL;

RECOVERY FROM ELBOW SURGERY REKINDLES BUNHNER'S FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ People everywhere revived an old romance on
Sept. 8, 1998, when Mark McGwire lined a baseball into history and
a Cupid's arrow through the hearts of wayward fans.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Buhner fell in love all over again, too. Only he didn't know
it at the time, and his reasons had nothing to do with a
record-breaking home run in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Sept. 8 was frightening for the Mariners' resident
tough guy. That was the day Buhner learned the problem with his
right elbow was much more serious than he had first been told. He
would need reconstruction of the elbow, requiring his second, and
most serious, surgery that year.
</P>
<P>
   The news, so ominous at first, turned out to be wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing _ it definitely rekindled my love for the
game and re-fueled my desire and fire, there's no doubt about it,''
Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going through a time when I needed a second wind. I know
it might sound bad, but there were a lot of things that were kind
of on my mind that I needed to get away from. This injury enabled
me to step back, really take a look at it and realize how much I
loved the game, how much I missed it. It was a wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner, who will play designated hitter in a morning ``B'' game
Thursday but appears healthy enough to play in the outfield, was
emotionally spent by the end of last season. Out for 59 games with
a knee injury, he agonized through the M's lost season, finding
himself wishing he could do more _ not only on the field, but
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a tendency to get caught up in a lot of different
things, trying to be a leader, trying to do this or do that,''
Buhner said. ``Now I realize that basically I have no control over
those things. The only thing I can control is what I do on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   He embraced the new challenge, aiming to return to the field as
quickly as possible. But nobody expected him to be where he is now.
If Buhner navigates carefully through this month of exhibition
games, he has a solid chance to open the season in right field on
April 5.
</P>
<P>
   The first several days of exhibition games, Buhner will play
designated hitter and pinch-hit, with an off-day or two mixed in.
He will start in left field on March 10, then gradually increase
his innings and at-bats and play consecutive games in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners would like to see Buhner play at least a half-dozen
full games in the outfield by the end of camp, and if everything
goes well, said trainer Rick Griffin, some of those games should be
in right.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to astound those who have gone through ``Tommy
John'' surgery, which normally takes at least nine to 12 months of
recovery time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been amazed at what Jay's doing at 5{ months,'' said M's
left-hander Butch Henry, who missed nearly 18 months after his
surgery in August 1995. ``He's a year and a half ahead of where I
was at that stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the reason for Buhner's progress is his trust and
confidence in the Mariner medical staff. Players routinely go out
of town for such surgeries, but Buhner had his performed by team
doctor Larry Pedegana. A year-round resident of the Northwest,
Buhner checked in every two weeks with Pedegana and worked out
daily at the Kingdome with Griffin. He allowed himself a week off
at Christmas, and only four other off days all winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all patients were like that,'' Pedegana said, ``it would
make surgery a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   How dutiful a patient was Buhner? He took his medical team on
vacation. Buhner and Griffin, who are best friends, have a cabin in
Montana, and they brought along Pedegana on a fly-fishing trip in
October.
</P>
<P>
   It was there Buhner made the first breakthrough in his recovery.
At first, Buhner said he would cast left-handed, but one day he
tried it with his right. Casting the fly rod, which is similar to
throwing a dart, Buhner realized he didn't hurt at all. He wasn't
even sore the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there for a week,'' Griffin said, ``and when we came
back he had full range of motion.''

   Buhner has known Pedegana and Griffin his whole Mariner career.
He said it was comforting this winter to know he could call them at
any time and get not only attention, but a straight answer. Instead
of hedging against a full recovery, Buhner said, Pedegana assured
him he could make a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Once he heard that, Buhner said, all that remained was the work.
It was something he could thrive on, especially when he heard this
from Griffin: No matter how hard it was for you to get to the major
leagues, the hardest thing you will ever do is recover from this
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing I told him is don't doubt yourself or doubt
that you can come back,'' Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner has had only minor setbacks. In December, he needed a
removal of scar tissue that was clamping down on his ulnar nerve
and causing him to lose feeling in two fingers. He had to stop
throwing on the second day of camp because of elbow soreness, but
by the end of the day he was throwing pain-free again.
</P>
<P>
   There are bound to be more rough days. Henry said you have to
respect the injury, but you will never recover without testing your
limits
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk a fine line between getting healthy again and
re-injuring it,'' Henry said, ``because you've got to push it to
its boundaries because that's the only way to make it stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples abound, and one stands out for Buhner. Anaheim
infielder Randy Velarde, a teammate of Buhner's in the Yankees'
minor-league system, played in only one game in 1997 after the
surgery, then had setbacks when he tried to return last spring and
again in May. Velarde didn't come back for good until August _ like
Henry, nearly 18 months later.
</P>
<P>
   As great as he feels right now, Buhner knows Velarde felt the
same way this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Velarde is probably one of the best physical specimens
you've ever seen, and if it can happen to him, it shows you
something,'' Buhner said. ``You get out there and you start to feel
good, and even when you don't you still push it, because you're a
gamer and you want to be out there. It's a rude reminder that
you've got to be smart, and even when you feel good, you've got to
limit how hard you go.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Buhner has positioned himself for a remarkable
comeback, but the arm he calls his pride and joy isn't back just
yet. The only thing that has returned for sure is his love for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   MARINER NOTES: Outfielder Butch Huskey was the Mariners'
happiest camper Wednesday, when his new No. 42 jerseys were
delivered to the clubhouse. Huskey had been issued No. 36 after
coming to Seattle in a trade from the New York Mets, but he had
worn 42 his whole career to honor Jackie Robinson. ``It's just a
number, but it's significant to me,'' said Huskey, who feared he
wouldn't be allowed to wear the number, which was retired by
baseball in 1997. ``I didn't want to make a big deal about it, but
there was no reason I couldn't get it if I was grandfathered into
it.'' ... The lineup for Thursday's ``A'' game against the San
Diego Padres: RF Ichiro Suzuki, SS Alex Rodriguez, CF Ken Griffey
Jr., 1B David Segui, LF Huskey, 3B Russ Davis, C Tom Lampkin, 2B
Carlos Guillen and P Jeff Fassero. The game can be heard on KNWX
radio 770 at 12:05 p.m.

LATER, ALLIGATORS; RANGERS NEED A BONAFIDE ACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Doug Melvin can't deny it. Neither can
Johnny Oates. But for the record, Tom Vida rejects the notion about
the Rangers being ace-less in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Vida''?
</P>
<P>
   A former high school coach in Ohio, Vida is the supervisor of
grounds at the Rangers' vast spring training complex, and has
helped maintain the best-kept baseball fields in Florida for 13
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep an eye on that lake over there,'' Vida advised yesterday.
``Then tell me what you see.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long until a 12-foot alligator crawled up on the
lake bank for a sunning session, no more than 70 yards from the
ticket windows at Charlotte County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   While small alligators have frequently homesteaded the three
lakes surrounding the main ballpark, this 12-footer is by far the
largest Vida has spotted on the grounds in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Such jaws haven't been seen around here since the last Will
Clark clubhouse tirade against the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' said Vida, ``we now officially lead the league in
alligator.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson told the Rangers no, then so did Roger Clemens.
But from the surrounding swamps, ``Ace the Alligator'' has arrived,
and joined up with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ace'' also has a traveling companion. ``Tail-Gunner'' is a
7-footer, large by normal ballpark lake standards, and he/she is
never far behind the big thing.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin has to be asking himself how come No. 1 pitchers aren't
finding the Rangers this attractive.
</P>
<P>
   But the general manager flashed plenty of teeth _ no, not quite
``Ace'' size _ when he smiled and said, ``I don't think that search
is ever over. The Yankees win 125 ballgames, have a staff leader
like \RDavid\S Wells and are still trying to upgrade by trading him
for Clemens. If the Yankees didn't think they had enough pitching,
who does?''
</P>
<P>
   Good point.
</P>
<P>
   The names to remember between now and July are obvious. Kenny
Rogers in Oakland. Curt Schilling in Philadelphia. Brad Radke in
Minnesota. Kevin Appier in Kansas City (if healthy). Alex Fernandez
in Florida (if healthy). Denny Neagle in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   When those teams start falling out of the race (for a couple,
that will be the end of April), one or more of these pitchers
figure to come available. The Rangers, of course, figure to be very
interested. None of them is Johnson or Clemens, except Schilling is
close. But all are appealing to any club wanting to upgrade its
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Here in early March, the Rangers' brass gives proper lip service
to its current rotation members, faking surprise that anyone would
think additional help is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Reality, of course, says Schilling could be this staff's new
alligator, or ``Ace,'' and any of the others would make the
rotation better.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hicks' hip pocket is sitting on go. A pitching trade will
happen at some point this spring, or, more likely, by July. But the
rub comes with what the Rangers are willing to give up.
</P>
<P>
   Once Ruben Mateo's name hit print as the key to the
almost-Clemens trade with Toronto, other clubs will now demand this
young, gold-plated outfield prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt we'd give Ruben up for anyone other than Clemens,''
Melvin said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Phillies are going to deal Schilling, then they would
certainly be asking for Mateo in the package _ and stay tuned on
what happens if Melvin is faced with that brain-squeezer. Actually,
such a thought already makes Melvin nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Tom \RHicks\S when we were talking about Clemens that I
had a knot in my stomach,'' he said. ``I couldn't explain if the
knot was caused by the excitement of possibly landing Clemens, or
the worry of giving up Mateo. Either way, it wasn't going to be a
deal where I gleefully walked to the microphones and announced it
to the media.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how much Melvin thinks of Mateo, slated for Triple-A duty
with Oklahoma this season, and in center field in Arlington in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the ever-present nightmare of having once traded a
young Sammy Sosa still dogging the organization, there is a
long-standing theory in baseball that even Melvin doesn't dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   That theory says never trade a hot pitching prospect, but always
consider dealing a positional prospect if you are receiving a top
pitcher in return. Such was the case with Mateo-Clemens. Such would
be the case with Mateo-Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Positional guys will come back to haunt you, too,'' said
Melvin, ``but they are also usually easier to evaluate than young
pitchers. And when that young pitcher goes somewhere else and
becomes like an ace, it stings the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, the Rangers will again try to pounce on a rotation
acquisition for this season. Meanwhile, they sit, wait and try to
stay out of the way of the only proven ace they currently have in
camp. Meaning ``Ace the Alligator.''

FREE HOUSE HOPES TO CHARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jockey Chris McCarron was always impressed with Free House's
ability and tenacity when he raced against the 5-year-old gray son
of Smokester.
</P>
<P>
   Now that McCarron is the regular rider of one of the favorites
in Saturday's $1 million Santa Anita Handicap, he understands why
he respected the 1997 Santa Anita Derby champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see why he's got so much talent,'' McCarron said. ``He's
a very grandly built horse. He's got a very muscular frame, and
he's got one of the smoothest strides of any horse I've ever
ridden. He's very efficient, there's no wasted action.
Consequently, fatigue becomes less of a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   That muscular frame and smooth, efficient stride have helped
Free House, a California-bred, win 8 of 20 lifetime starts for
earnings of nearly $2.5 million. Included among the eight victories
was a four-length romp in last summer's Grade I Pacific Classic at
Del Mar, when he ran away and hid from horses the likes of
Gentlemen and Puerto Madero.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Puerto Madero, who may be favored when the horses go
postward for the 62nd Big 'Cap at approximately 2:40 p.m., is a
much tougher horse now than in August. But so is Free House,
according to his connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more mature,'' trainer Paco Gonzalez said. ``He's 5 years
old now. He's at the best age for a horse. His attitude is
different. He's more like a man now.''
</P>
<P>
   Free House comes into Saturday's race off a neck victory over
defending Big 'Cap champion Malek in the Grade II San Antonio
Handicap. The two hooked up head-and-head virtually the entire way,
spitting out turtle-like fractions of :24.17, :48.56 and 1:12.7 for
the 1 1/8 miles on the main track.
</P>
<P>
   Malek may skip this race, however, in favor of the Dubai World
Cup on March 28. With a little early speed, Free House could find
himself on the lead again trying to hold off Silver Charm, Puerto
Madero and Event of the Year in the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Can Free House take this Grade I field gate to wire?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna leave it up to Chris,'' Gonzalez said. ``If he feels
comfortable being on the lead, that's fine. He knows the horse
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Said McCarron: ``And I'm going to leave it up to the horse. If
he breaks cleanly. I'm going to let him run out of there and see
where he is and how aggressive he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key with him is to just allow him to settle into stride,
make him happy. If he's content and happy in the early running of
the race, he's going to give you everything he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   Free House and Silver Charm, who have developed a rivalry dating
back to their battles as 3-year-olds, will be hooking up for the
eighth time. Silver Charm has won five of the seven matchups,
including the past four.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm's affable trainer, Bob Baffert, used to joke that
the two horses knew each other. Free House's owner, Trudy
McCaffery, laughs when the statement is relayed to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they do know each other,'' she said. ``I said to
somebody the other day, I think it's really impressive that Silver
Charm and Free House are still, at 5 years old, rivaling each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez does not enjoy the rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just enjoy my horse,'' the Arcadia resident said. ``Every
time he runs, it's a special race for me no matter who is in the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   So as McCarron prepares to climb aboard Free House for the sixth
time, dating back to a seven-length victory in last summer's Grade
II Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood Park, Gonzalez marvels at the
strength of this year's Big 'Cap field and is thankful his horse is
100 percent fit.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffery said Free House is more confident, more focused than
when he finished second in the Preakness Stakes and third in the
Kentucky Derby and Belmont as a three-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Chris after (Free House's) work on Monday (six
furlongs in a bullet 1:11 3/5), and to quote him it sent shivers up
his spine,'' McCaffery said. ``I don't think the horse could be
doing any better.''

RED SOX AREN'T READY TO THROW IN TOWEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ The Boston Red Sox have declined to offer
unconditional surrender.
</P>
<P>
   The hated New York Yankees have Roger Clemens, and Mo Vaughn has
left town. But the Red Sox are bravely going on with the season
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't have to go out there, but we have to because
we're getting paid,'' said Red Sox second baseman Jeff Frye, taking
the realistic approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox also know that to cancel the season would also deny
their painfully loyal fans another summer of pathos at Fenway Park.
They wouldn't be able to sit in the shadow of the Green Monster,
sip their suds, eat their Fenway Franks and lament blunders past:
the loss of Babe Ruth, the betrayal of Carlton Fisk and now the
departure of Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was the Red Sox's leader and best hitter, an All-Star
first baseman and community activist who was allowed to get away as
a free agent. He follows the well-trodden paths of Fred Lynn, Wade
Boggs, Fisk, Clemens and Red Sox icons whose relationship with the
mother ship ended in bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the fanatical faithful remain behind and prepare to
chalk up another season without a World Series championship, an
unhappy famine that is entering its 81st season.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox do get to play host to the All-Star Game at Fenway
in July, but that might only serve to reopen old wounds should
Clemens be standing on the mound in a Yankees uniform and Vaughn at
first base wearing the dreadful Angels digs.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the Red Sox clubhouse is there the smallest bud of hope.
This is the team that had the second-best record in the American
League last season and there is a belief that the Yankees are at
least slightly less than invincible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason why they can't be beat,'' first baseman/DH
Mike Stanley said. ``Last year was a pretty magical season for
them. Everything fell into place. You never know what could happen
in the course of a year. Guys get injured, have a bad year. You
don't win anything until you go out on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The bravado might be a little more realistic had the Red Sox
re-signed Vaughn. Instead, they settled for Jose Offerman, a
defensive liability without power, but who has shown a knack for
both getting on base and stealing a few. He had a .403 on-base
percentage for the Royals last season along with 45 stolen bases
and 102 runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Red Sox gave him $26 million over four years, hoping
he'll offset the loss of Vaughn's 40 home runs and 115 runs batted
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair to compare me and him,'' said Offerman, who
might have a hard time convincing Red Sox fans of that. ``We are
two different players. There are things that he can do that are
hard for me. My job is to get on base.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox historically are a power-based team, but producing
again will difficult to do without Vaughn. Instead, they'll have to
rely on a pitching staff that had the second-best earned-run
average in the American League last season.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez is one of the best pitchers in baseball, Tom
Gordon proved to be a success as a closer, and Tim Wakefield (17-8)
and Bret Saberhagen (15-8) help give the Red Sox a strong rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox also have Nomar Garciaparra, one of the best
shortstops in the league. But he also shoulders the burden of being
the Red Sox's new team leader in the absence of Vaughn, a
responsibility he would prefer to decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo is over there,'' Garciaparra said. ``He's worried about
getting the Angels to the World Series. We're doing the same thing.
He's got a job to do and so do I.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox's pitching makes them a wild-card threat, but any
success they have this year will be accompanied with the cry, ``If
only we had Mo!'' The season draws nigh and nobody does pathos like
a Red Sox fan.

QB SEARCH CONTINUES AS FREROTTE PASSES ON HAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ The Seahawks were stymied in their attempts to
sign a veteran quarterback for the second time when Gus Frerotte
signed a contract with the Detroit Lions Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frerotte, who visited the Seahawks last week, was given a
three-year, $3 million deal by the Lions to be the backup to
Charlie Batch.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks also were interested in Doug Pederson, but the
former backup with the Green Bay Packers signed a three-year, $4.9
million deal two weeks ago to be the starter in Philadelphia,
scrapping a scheduled visit to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently working against the Seahawks is the presence of a
young incumbent, 26-year-old Jon Kitna, and a rumor circulating
among agents and front-office executives from other teams that the
Seahawks will use their first-round pick to select a quarterback in
April's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a gambler, the upside situation is clearly
Seattle,'' one agent said. ``But the unknown element is whether the
Seahawks will draft a quarterback in the first round. A lot of
people think that will happen, and even more are saying that will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   So new Seahawks coach and general manager Mike Holmgren, who had
coached Pederson in Green Bay, continues to look for a young
veteran to challenge Kitna for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a list of players we are either talking to or we're
going to bring in here,'' Holmgren said. ``Gus was one. Doug
Pederson was one. We'll probably continue to do that until we find
someone and the fit is right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks also had Chris Miller and Stoney Case in for visits
last week. Case signed with the Indianapolis Colts Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The pool of available talent is becoming more stagnant because
10 quarterbacks already have been removed from contention. Two have
re-signed with their old teams: Casey Weldon (Redskins) and Wade
Wilson (Raiders). Two others have been traded: Brad Johnson (to the
Redskins by the Vikings) and Ty Detmer (to the Browns by the
49ers). Six more have signed with new teams: Frerotte, Pederson,
Case, Rich Gannon (Raiders), Kerry Collins (Giants) and Trent Green
(Rams).
</P>
<P>
   What remains is an assortment of quarterbacks who are either too
old (Steve DeBerg, Warren Moon, Dave Krieg, Frank Reich and Steve
Bono); too inexperienced (Shane Matthews, Doug Nussmeier, Steve
Stenstrom, Scott Zolak and Steve Walsh); too similar (Heath Shuler,
Danny Kanell, Donald Hollas and Todd Philcox); or too expensive, in
that they are restricted free agents and would cost the team
signing them a draft choice (Bobby Hoying, Tony Banks, Jay Fiedler
and Steve Matthews) or make too much money (Jeff George).
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks are not alone in this. The San Diego Chargers,
Baltimore Ravens, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Pittsburgh Steelers and
Chicago Bears also are seriously searching for quarterbacks.

ON DEFENSE ALONE, MAVERICKS' SHAWN BRADLEY AT HEIGHT OF POWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The proof came Tuesday night, as it has in a number of
games this season, that Shawn Bradley can be a force in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   And he has no need to score a lot of points to make that point.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had an NBA-season-high nine blocked shots to spark the
victory against the Los Angeles Clippers. And now, Mavericks fans
can no longer laugh about Bradley awkwardly trying to become a
dominant offensive threat. Instead, Bradley sets a tone on defense
with his shot-blocking and rebounding skills, and that has
transformed him into a threat opponents have to account for.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been several games this year where Shawn Bradley
was the best player we had out on the floor,'' Mavericks coach Don
Nelson said. ``In fact, I don't think he's had a bad game yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's new role _ where his offense is de-emphasized _ has
helped him become more comfortable on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more confident, whether it's because of this role or
maturity or whatever,'' Bradley said. ``I just feel that way. But
it's a combination of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson figured the only way he was going to get maximum
production out of Bradley was to diminish his role as a scorer.
That plan was put into action before this year, and Bradley has
responded with his most productive all-around season to date.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley averages six points, 6.3 rebounds and 3.94 blocks while
playing an average of just 23.8 minutes per game. He is shooting a
team-high 50.8 percent from the field, and has blocked four or more
shots in 10 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   He is averaging the most blocks per game of his career while
playing the fewest minutes of his career. And Bradley and the
Mavericks take a four-game home winning streak into tonight's 7:30
game at Reunion Arena against the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's teammates are benefiting from his defensive dominance.
They now can gamble and overplay the passing lanes, knowing that
the 7-foot-6 center is back in the middle ready to clean up their
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect him to be that force, and he's been doing it
defensively,'' forward Michael Finley said. ``Guys have been beaten
off the dribble and Shawn's been there blocking shots and just
making their shots even harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he can do that on a night-in and night-out basis, it
makes us good defensively. And when he scores offensively, it's
just an extra added bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley said opposing players ``just kept trying him and trying
him and Bradley keeps blocking their shots.'' That was very
apparent Tuesday night against the Los Angeles Clippers, when
Bradley blocked nine shots, tied for tops in a single game in the
NBA this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who said he might retire when his contract expires
after the 2000-2001 season, has a bad reputation around the NBA of
repeated complaints to referees during the games about perceived
blown calls. As part of his maturation process, those complaints
have decreased considerably this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't change the coaches decision, or what the coach's
philosophy is,'' Mavericks forward A.C. Green said. ``And he can't
change the referees, whatever their impressions of Shawn Bradley is
throughout the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he can control his effort, he can control the way he goes
out and plays the game, and that's really the most important thing
right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going out and kicking behind every night _ that's his
attitude.''

FOR TCU WOMEN BASKETBALL'S TEAM, STEPSISTER DAYS ARE GONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Once upon a time, there was a hapless stepsister
upon whose head had been placed a loathsome curse.
</P>
<P>
   The curse was so bad, the stepsister once lost to Texas by a
score of 96-33.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody came to watch the stepsister. Few even cared.
</P>
<P>
   The curse was so vile, the hapless stepsister once lost 64 of 67
basketball games. It lost to Rice _ Rice! _ by 51 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to the point,'' said an innocent voice who was there,
``that we were asking ourselves, `Why are we even in practice?' We
knew people were going to kick our butts.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it came to pass that a brave prince arrived.
</P>
<P>
   He challenged the curse. He ignored the past. He showed TCU
women's basketball, long the university's spurned stepsister, that
it could, indeed, go to the palace ball. OK _ maybe the NIT ball.
</P>
<P>
   Cry no more, Cinderella. Even after a 74-62 loss to New Mexico
yesterday in the second round of the Western Athletic Conference
tournament, the Frogs were able to walk away smiling and proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one on this team likes to lose today,'' guard Jill Sutton
said. ``But I know that all the players are going to walk away from
this feeling good. Yesterday was the best any of us have felt in a
long time. It was a big step.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday's first round, no TCU women's basketball team had
won a game in its conference tournament. Until this season, no
NCAA-member TCU women's basketball team had ever had a winning
record.
</P>
<P>
   Until yesterday, no coach of a TCU women's basketball team could
actually wish aloud for a postseason tournament invitation without
drawing a room-wide smirk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely deserving to play after this,'' said Mike
Petersen, whose princely coaching has brought TCU from the 2-25
cinders to a relative 16-12 throne.
</P>
<P>
   It was three seasons ago that the university stood on the damp
end of that 2-25 plank. Under coach Shell Robinson, the Frogs had
been a carefree bunch destined to also record seasons of 5-22 and
1-26.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach didn't know how to use our players,'' said senior
Ginger Usher of Keller, the lone player remaining from the Robinson
years. ``We would go into games and never have a thought about
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU had a choice. It could go on losing to Rice, 93-42, and
getting hammered by the likes of Southwest Texas and
Missouri-Kansas City. Or it could do it right.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen, a successful coach at New Mexico State, was brought in
at twice the salary that the previous head coach was making.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing we had to do was change the attitude,''
Petersen said. ``One of the hardest things to do is to teach
players to expect to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Usher remembers the earliest message being one of ``be good or
be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the boss, though,'' she said. ``He made it clear to us
what he expected of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs found Petersen to be a relentless stickler for
preparation. His scouting reports began to take on an eerie
thoroughness. He stressed knowing how to move your feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the best basketball knowledge of any coach I've ever
been around,'' Usher said. ``And, somehow, he got it all pulled
together.''
</P>
<P>
   They won't be playing in the WAC tourney semifinals tomorrow.
The Frogs played the higher-seeded Lobos off their feet in the
first 17 minutes yesterday, only to run out of gas and fresh legs
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room when it was all over, Petersen brought tears
to some eyes by telling them that they've been a special team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my 11th team,'' he told a visitor later, ``and it's by
far not the most wins (16) I've ever had. But as I told them, it's
one of my most favorite teams ever. They've been a special group.
They've done things the people here have never done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Petersen knew the risks of coming to TCU, where the program
averaged less than seven wins for an entire decade. But the kids he
recruited knew the risks and accepted the challenge as well.
</P>
<P>
   They are players like the talented sophomore twins, Jill and Amy
Sutton. Players like Karen Clayton from Southlake Carroll, and
Duncan, Okla., freshman Tricia Payne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told each of them, `They were 3-52 at TCU. That's not my
fault. If you come, we'll win,' '' Petersen said. ``Every one of
them bought into it _ bought into the chance to do something that's
never been done before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of those kids could have gone elsewhere. The twins
could have gone to Oklahoma. Clayton was recruited by Oklahoma
State, Colorado and Florida. They could have gone to a school that
would've sounded better.''
</P>
<P>
   The curse over, Mike Petersen waits for a princely phone call
from the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this sounds pretty good,'' he said.

 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Otumfuo Opoku Ware II, the traditional king of the Asante
people, has died in his palace in Kumasi, Ghana, the ancient
capital of the Asante, who once ruled a powerful and complex
political confederation in West Africa. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Officials confirmed his death but did not give a date. Agence
France-Presse reported that an official announcement was being
withheld pending consultations on burial arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Given the deep veneration in which the king was held by millions
of Asante (also called Ashantis), the funeral is expected to draw
enormous crowds. In August 1995, when the king celebrated the 25th
anniversary of his reign, he was carried on a platform of gold
ornaments through a crowd of 70,000 guests.
</P>
<P>
   During his 29-year reign the king, a former lawyer, was the
spiritual and cultural leader of his people, and his power extended
into every-day life, particularly in the southern half of Ghana,
where Asante influence remains paramount.
</P>
<P>
   He ruled on land disputes, and judges whom he appointed settle
civil suits and imprison criminals. He received rents on royal
lands, and it was understood that no major development in Asante
lands could be undertaken without his approval. Most Ghanaian gold
mines are in these lands.
</P>
<P>
   In the manner of earlier Asante rulers, who were uncles chosen
in a matrilineal system, he rarely appeared in public, and when he
did it was with mannered regal austerity. Decked in gold and
wrapped in the intricately woven kente cloth for which his people
are famous, he walked beneath a parasol held by aides to maintain a
``spiritual equilibrium.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke mainly through a royal spokesman. As Adum Bawuah, an
Asante translator in New York, noted: ``The Asante don't respect
you if you speak too literally. In Twi, if you don't know how to
speak in parables, you're a nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   The king was very much a somebody, and was expert in drawing
allusions as required.
</P>
<P>
   The king was born into the royal family in Kumasi, and attended
an Anglican mission elementary school. After secondary school he
trained as a surveyor. In 1951 he left the country, then still
called the Gold Coast, for London, where he studied law. In 1962 he
returned to an independent Ghana, where he practiced law and served
as commissioner of communications.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he was designated ambassador to Italy. His wife, Lady
Victoria, was often at his side as he traveled abroad. She died in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The king was survived by a son and two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 the king renounced his ambassadorship when the former
king, Prempeh II, died and he was chosen to succeed him as
Asantehene, the paramount leader. He regarded his duties as
Asantehene more demanding than those of ambassador and at least
equally important for the progress of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   The king ascended not to a throne but to the Golden Stool of the
Asante. According to Asante lore, the stool had been plucked from
the sky by the first Asante king, Osei Tutu, who built a
confederation of village leaders that in the 18th century extended
from Ghana to Togo. The confederation traded gold, cloth, and
slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 19th century, Britain and the Asante drifted into
hostility, and the confederation weakened. In 1896 the British
seized King Prempeh I and escorted him eastward across Africa to
exile in the Seychelles, in the Indian Ocean. The stool was hidden,
and four years later, on a visit to Kumasi, the British governor
general of the Gold Coast Colony, Sir Frederic Hodgson, became
outraged when the tribal elders did not allow him to sit on it as
the representative of Queen Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   Word of this incident aroused Asante to a bitterly fought
uprising that lasted nine months before the British suppressed it.
In 1902 Asante lands were formally incorporated into the Gold
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   When the Gold Coast began to move toward direct rule in the
1920s, the stool was recovered. Prempeh I was brought back from the
Seychelles in 1925 and given limited powers as a figurehead. When
he died in 1935, Prempeh II was crowned as Asantehene in a
traditional ceremony in which he was held aloft, hovering over the
golden stool, but not touching it.
</P>
<P>
   Ghana became independent in 1957, but the office of Asantehene
and the Asante institutions have outlasted the centralized,
pan-Africanist policies that the leader, Kwame Nkrumah, promoted.

CLIPPERS SO BAD THEY COULD BE GOOD FOR NBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Move over, Mark McGwire, make room for the Los Angeles
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Just as McGwire's pursuit with Sammy Sosa on the home run record
handcuffed fans to baseball last summer, the Clippers are preparing
for a magical run toward imperfection that should likewise
captivate basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer: ``Did McGwire go deep again?''
</P>
<P>
   This spring: ``Did the Clips get beat again?''
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's 13-point loss to the Mavericks, the Clippers are
0-13, steaming toward the 0-17 NBA record for disgustingly
interesting starts held by the expansion Miami Heat in 1988-89.
LA's ugly stepsisters next play at Houston and at San Antonio
before a home-and-home with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, 0-17 should be a reality. McGwire hit 70, could
the Clippers lose 50?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is going to be easy for us,'' Clippers coach Chris
Ford said. ``No one wants to be the team to give us a gift. I'm
sure the embarrassment of losing to us is the topic of every team's
pregame discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   The next game in which the Clippers will be less than a 10-point
underdog will come March 19 at Toronto, at which point they could
be a headline-grabbing 0-22.
</P>
<P>
   How bad are these Clippers? They've lost just once by less than
four points and already have home losses to Chicago, Dallas, Golden
State and Vancouver. Trailing the Mavericks 34-16 in the second
quarter, Ford trotted out a lineup of James Robinson, Sherman
Douglas, Tyrone Nesby, Brian Skinner and Rodney Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Duke would wipe the floor with them and they'd
be favored by only a bucket against the Washington Generals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they're struggling,'' Mavericks guard Michael
Finley said. ``Whoever loses to them will be the first story on
``SportsCenter''.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame center-turned-Clippers TV commentator Bill Walton
thinks long and hard when asked how bad LA is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm,'' Walton said scratching his red head. ``The effort is
there, but to say the talent isn't would be a severe
understatement.''
</P>
<P>
   Look no further than a management whose litany of first-round
draft choices reads like a who's who of lottery busts: Benoit
Benjamin, Reggie Williams, Joe Wolf, Ken Norman, Danny Manning,
Hersey Hawkins, Danny Ferry, Bo Kimble, Loy Vaught, LeRon Ellis,
Randy Woods, Elmore Spencer, Terry Dehere, Lamond Murray, Greg
Minor, Antonio McDyess, Lorenzen Wright, Maurice Taylor, Michael
Olowokandi and Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Donald T. Sterling, the captain of this Clippers' sinking
ship, refused to hire a head coach during the lockout in order to
save money. When the lockout ended, they had no coach, and No. 1
overall pick Michael Olowokandi was playing in Europe. Just last
season, when they bolted to a 1-12 start, the Clippers traded
blossoming star and fan favorite Brent Barry for Ike Austin, then
let the franchise center get away in free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really tough,'' Murray said. ``You want to see a light at
the end of the tunnel. But right now it looks pretty dark.''
</P>
<P>
   For morbid curiosity, the Clippers are great for the NBA. The
Mavericks, in fact, should hoist a banner to the top of Reunion
Arena in appreciation. Without the Clippers, Dallas would be the
butt of NBA jokes.
</P>
<P>
   LA's first-round flops and front-office follies make fans forget
that the Clippers have actually gone to the playoffs twice this
decade and won four postseason games. The Mavericks, meanwhile,
haven't seen May in eight seasons and last won a playoff game in
1988. In fact, if the '90s were a season, the Mavericks (186-486)
would trail the Clippers (243-426) by 58 1/2 games.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the Clippers who will flirt with the worst season in
NBA history as far as winning percentage. To eclipse the .109
established by the 9-73 Sixers in 1972-73, LA will have to go 5-45
(.100).
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Clippers are gaining momentum, and fans are
starting to take notice of their improbable run at an unbreakable
record. The magic number for imperfection is 37 and counting.

LAKERS RALLY TO BEAT SUNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ It was an uneasy marriage at first, the Lakers and
Dennis Rodman, and complicated by a change in the head of household
with the arrival of surrogate father-coach Kurt Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers promptly won four straight, and Lakers executive
Jerry West deemed the new era of good feeling a mere honeymoon for
the newlyweds.
</P>
<P>
   They're making it a long vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Behind a huge second half from Kobe Bryant, the Lakers posted
their second straight comeback victory over the Phoenix Suns 101-95
at the Forum on Wednesday night. And now they're 5-0 since the
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant hit just 2 of 7 shots in the first half and looked
generally out of sorts before catching fire with an 11-point third
quarter and a nine-point fourth. He finished with a game-high 32
points.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal added 27 points and Rodman grabbed a
season-high 17 rebounds. Clifford Robinson led the Suns with 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns led by three points early in the fourth when Rick Fox
brought the Lakers back with eight straight points, including two
3-pointers, to make it 81-78. Bryant followed with six straight to
complete a 16-5 run and give the Lakers an 89-81 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix never got closer than four points after that.
</P>
<P>
   Every marriage has its rough spots. Rambis just hoped for a long
honeymoon, but he was realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, the first loss is going to happen,'' he said
before tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   That moment will have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis was fortunate not to have suffered his first career loss
two nights earlier in Phoenix, when the Lakers had to overcome an
eight-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Hard on his players, hard on himself, Rambis said he was
partially to blame for the near-defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't real happy with the way I prepared the team to play
in Phoenix,'' he said. ``We didn't get out of the gates really
well. We didn't execute the way we're capable of executing. . . .
There's a lot of things we didn't do, and I take responsibility for
that. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I was even less happy after I watched the videotape of the
game. I let (the players) know _ we won, but that doesn't mean that
everything's OK. We took a little step back.''
</P>
<P>
   And then they stood in place, following one slow start with
another. The Lakers lost an early lead, fell to a 34-25 deficit
after one quarter and trailed 55-49 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Kobe time. His jumper failing him for the first
half, Bryant went to the more direct approach _ taking it to the
hole three straight times and scoring 11 consecutive points as the
Lakers regained the lead for the first time, 68-65.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was back and forth for the rest of the third
quarter, with the Lakers holding a 73-72 lead heading into the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was much like the first half Monday in Phoenix,
with the Lakers again struggling out of the gate while the Suns'
shooters went unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was Clifford Robinson and George McCloud doing the
damage _ Robinson with 15 points on 6-of-9 shooting and McCloud
with 10 points, all in the first quarter, on 4-of-5. The Suns shot
51.1 percent in the half, while the Lakers again found their
jumpshots ailing.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant and Jones each made just 2 of 7 shots, and the Lakers
shot 39.5 percent as a team. Even Dennis Rodman's nine rebounds in
14 minutes and stubborn defense of Tom Gugliotta didn't make much
of a difference.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal led the Lakers with 19 points in the first half.

BRUINS RUN OUT OF GAS 
</HEADLINE>

   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Maybe the physical toll from the night
before, when they had to battle tooth and nail with the Phoenix
Coyotes, had taken too much out of them. Maybe it was the fatigue
of playing their third game in five days. Maybe it was the result
of taking penalties at the wrong time and not converting their
power plays. Perhaps the Carolina Hurricanes just played better.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the Bruins looked battle weary
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night and the result was a 2-1 loss at the Greensboro
Coliseum before a sparse crowd of 7,507.
</P>
<P>
   The arena was the temperature of a meat locker and Boston's
scoring touch was about as cold as the Bruins suffered their first
defeat in six games (4-1-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances we had weren't solid chances,'' said coach Pat
Burns. ``We missed the net a lot. We fought hard but we came up
short. We've got to put it aside and go onto the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   The only saving grace was that the Florida Panthers, Boston's
closest contender for the eighth and final playoff berth in the
Eastern Conference, blew a 5-0 lead and lost to Colorado, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   The rule of thumb when playing on the second of back-to-back
nights is get the lead early. That way you can conserve some energy
for when the legs start to give out late in the third period and
the weariness sets in.
</P>
<P>
   However, that objective didn't come to fruition as Boston fell
behind and wound up using most of its energy in the late going to
kill off penalties (three in the third period, six total).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed with our start once again,'' said goalie
Byron Dafoe, who kept the Bruins in it, finishing with 23 saves.
``We were outshot, 9-1, in the first 10 minutes. They only got one
goal out of it but maybe we get four shots and it's a 0-0 game.
Instead, we're down, 1-0. They're another team that's good at
holding a lead. They definitely took advantage of the fact that we
played (Tuesday) night. They're a very fast skating team and they
came out flying and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The first period was a scramble with both clubs trying to get
their offense on track. The Hurricanes took a 1-0 lead at 7:46 on a
goal by former Bruins defenseman Glen Wesley. Sami Kapanen left a
drop pass at the right point for Martin Gelinas. Gelinas fired a
shot from the right circle that Dafoe stopped but the rebound
bounced to Wesley in the left circle and he buried it into the top
of the net for his fifth goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had a golden opportunity to tie it when they had a
two-man advantage for more than a minute. With Gelinas off for
holding and Kent Manderville joining him in the box 55 seconds
later, Boston had a five-on-three for 1:05. The Bruins managed two
shots but couldn't get anything past goalie Arturs Irbe.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the period, the Bruins pulled even on a goal by Anson
Carter, his 11th of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Carter got the puck as a result of a major hit by Ken Belanger.
Carter skated in alone on Irbe and beat the netminder with a
forehander inside the left post at 18:38.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes took the lead for good early in the second period
on a goal by Gelinas. Center Keith Primeau got the puck behind the
Boston net and fed a centering pass to Gelinas in front at 3:05. It
was Gelinas' 11th goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had to kill off two Carolina power plays in the
middle period, both of which yielded quality scoring chances. One
came at 12:48 when Primeau had a point-blank chance on Dafoe. A few
minutes later, with Don Sweeney in the box, Dafoe again faced a
point-blank blast, this time off the stick of Ron Francis, who took
a centering pass from Jeff O'Neill, but Dafoe stood tall.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had a hard time breaking into the Carolina zone and
even when they did, not much happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they're a pretty stingy team to play against,'' said
center Jason Allison. ``Maybe we got outbattled a little. It's
something that can't happen. Guys are working hard, don't get me
wrong. It wasn't from lack of effort. They didn't give us very much
and we didn't earn very much.''

HOLY CROSS WOMEN GAIN NCAA BERTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER _ The crowd of 3,152 set a Patriot League
championship-game record. In numbers, in decibels, in frenzy. They
love their Crusaders in the cozy Hart Center, and think nothing of
painting themselves purple, or dashing to and fro in purple capes,
or screaming in a purple fury. All they expect in return is a Holy
Cross win.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just what the fans got Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night as the No. 1
seed Crusaders downed No. 3 Navy, 72-58, to win their sixth Patriot
League tournament in seven years and another automatic bid to the
NCAA women's basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer I'm in this thing, the sweeter it gets,'' said Holy
Cross coach Bill Gibbons, coaching in his ninth league final and
winning his sixth. ``I always dreamed about this type of
atmosphere. I think the first couple, only my family knew we were
in a championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't as easy as tying on a purple kerchief or even
dredging up a purple boa. For starters, Amy O'Brien, whose 22.6
scoring average ranks eighth in the country, was held to a single
field goal in the first half by the only league team to beat the
Crusaders this season (81-74 Jan. 17).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never sweat so much,'' said O'Brien, a senior and
two-time Patriot League player of the year playing her last game in
Hart. ``I couldn't hold on to the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   After managing an 11-point halftime lead despite their star's
butterfingers, the Crusaders (21-7) saw their lead whittled to
43-39 with 12:41 left in the game. But then Holy Cross kicked into
gear for its best offense of the night, exploding on a 21-11 run
that put away the Midshipmen (17-11).
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, breaking free of double- and triple-teams in the second
half, finished as the game's leading scorer with 25 points, while
5-foot-6-inch dynamo guard Anna Kinne, who kept the Crusaders in
the game early on, had 15 on her way to being named the
tournament's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Midshipmen crawled back into the game, a technical
foul early in the first half turned the tide in favor of Holy
Cross. With the score tied, 12-12, with 12:29 left in the half,
Navy center Laurie Coffey, an all-Patriot League first-teamer,
protested too vigorously after picking up a quick second foul and
was slapped with her third via a T.
</P>
<P>
   Kinne made both free throws, giving the Crusaders the lead for
good at 14-12. Coffey stayed on the bench for the rest of the half,
and she soon was joined in foul trouble by forward Erica Hayes,
also a first-team all-leaguer. With Navy coach Joe Sanchez forced
to play four guards at times, the Midshipmen could never get back
in their game. Midway through the half, Navy went on a 6 1/2-minute
scoreless drought. By then, the Crusaders were up by 11, thanks
mostly to the shooting of Kinne, who was 3 for 7 behind the arc in
the half. Holy Cross led, 34-23, at the break.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Crusaders earned 27 of their points from behind the
arc. ``Those nine 3-pointers, we didn't count on those,'' said
Sanchez. ``We worried a little too much inside.''

PROVIDENCE GETS THE BOOT 
</HEADLINE>
 EAST-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No. 10 seed Georgetown, looking to avenge a 2-point
loss in its regular-season finale at Providence College, advanced
to the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament in Madison Square
Garden with a 68-66 victory over the seventh-seeded Friars
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje led the Hoyas (15-14) by scoring 14 of his
team-high 18 points in the second half. He gave Georgetown the lead
for good when he hit the front end of a one-and-one with 15.2
seconds to go. Erron Maxey led Providence (16-13) with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very gratifying for a lot of reasons, because we really
needed this victory,'' said Georgetown coach Craig Esherick, whose
team will face No. 2 seed Miami in the quarterfinals. ``I'm so
proud of the way our team fought their way back.'' The Hoyas
trailed, 49-39, in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The game was marred by controversy when, unbeknownst to
officials, Trez Kilpatrick threw a punch at Providence's Jamel
Thomas with 12:17 to go. Kilpatrick was hit with a technical, but
was allowed to remain in the game and came back to score a key
basket that gave Georgetown a 64-62 lead with 3:56 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official who saw the play deemed it to be a forearm in the
player's back and assessed a deadball technical,'' said lead
official Jim Burr. ``At no time did anyone mention to us that a
punch had been thrown or did we think about the possibility of a
punch being thrown.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Thomas: ``I'm not going to complain about the
(officiating). They called it, and you have to respect that and
deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had a chance to make it all moot, but was unable to
squeeze off a final shot. With 12.4 seconds left, John Linehan
dribbled across midcourt and got the ball to Thomas with six
seconds remaining. However, Thomas (17 points) committed a critical
turnover (his fourth of the game) when he was trapped in the lane
and lost the handle as he attempted to dish it to Maxey.
</P>
<P>
   Villanova 73, West Virginia 61 _ John Celestand rallied the No.
5 seed Wildcats from a 29-24 halftime deficit by scoring 21 of his
game-high 26 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Celestand connected on 7 of 15 field goals, including 5 of 10
from 3-point range, while Howard Brown chipped in 16 points to help
Villanova (21-9) earn a berth in the quarterfinals against
fourth-seeded Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Brown scored on a putback that tied it, 57-57, and Celestand
followed with a layup that gave Villanova the lead for good, 59-57,
with 3:15 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall 79, Notre Dame 69 _ No. 9 seed Seton Hall got
double-figure scoring from three starters, including 18 points
apiece from Duane Jordan and Rimas Kaukenas, to secure a matchup
against top seed Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The Fighting Irish suffered their fourth straight first-round
loss despite getting 28 points and 15 rebounds from freshman Troy
Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers 64, Pittsburgh 51 _ Geoff Billet, Rob Hodgson, and
Alvydas Tenys each scored 11 points apiece to lead the No. 6
Scarlet Knights to a quarterfinal matchup against No. 3 seed St.
John's. It was the final game for Pitt coach Ralph Willard, who
earlier in the season announced he was stepping down.

 10-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ For three years they had been the Atlantic 10
tournament's equivalent of a pitcher batting against Greg Maddux.
Since joining the league in 1996, Fordham has been an easy out, a
virtual afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   This year was supposed to be different. Fordham entered
Wednesday's first-round contest against Virginia Tech having won a
school-record five regular-season A-10 games and as a No. 5 seed,
were considered a sleeper.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, the Rams discovered nothing has changed as
regards the tournament. Its 74-63 loss to the Hokies wasn't even
compelling: Virginia Tech (12-15) jumped to a 33-24 halftime lead,
increased it to as many as 15 in the second half, then withstood a
mild Fordham rally late.
</P>
<P>
   Fordham finished its season at 12-15, its best mark since the
1993-94 season.
</P>
<P>
   Rolan Roberts had 19 points to lead a balanced attack for
Virginia Tech, which shot 57 percent from the floor in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an easy game to analyze. Their defense overpowered our
offense and we just didn't play any defense,'' said Fordham's Nick
Macarchuk, the A-10 coach of the year. ``They just overpowered us
and outplayed us in every facet of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton 70, St. Bonaventure 69 _ Dayton center Mark Ashman had a
team-high 16 points and sank a 5-foot baseline jump shot with 1:08
left to give the Flyers an overtime victory over the Bonnies.
</P>
<P>
   St. Bonaventure (14-15) had several chances to tie it or take
the lead after Ashman's shot, but missed 3 of 4 free throws. The
Bonnies had possession with 16.7 seconds left but guard J.R.
Bremmer missed a shot just before the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   La Salle 81, St. Joseph's 54 _ The Explorers won their first
tournament game since joining the A-10 three years ago with a
surprisingly easy romp over the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Carr scored 14 of his game-high 21 points in the first
half as La Salle (13-14), which needed two overtimes to beat St.
Joseph's (12-18) Jan. 23, jumped to a 48-26 halftime lead, then
coasted.

HEBERT STOPS KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Kings were a desperate team heading into Wednesday
night's game at the Pond. The Mighty Ducks were merely a team that
wants to continued to play like a desperate team even though their
playoff chances look better and better each day.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Kings played desperately, knowing full well that
their playoff hopes get slimmer with every loss. But Guy Hebert and
the Ducks were able to hold off the Kings 2-1 before 17,174 at the
Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks certainly couldn't have planned it, but they played
their version of rope-a-dope. Anaheim landed two punches early
(goals by Matt Cullen and Teemu Selanne) and then spent the rest of
the night avoiding the Kings' counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks had to kill off a Kings power play in the final two
minutes and did so; Tomas Sandstrom forced the Kings to take a
penalty of their own after goalie Stephane Fiset had been pulled to
give Los Angeles a two-man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles outshot Anaheim 34-14 but the Kings lost their
fourth consecutive game to Hebert and the Ducks this season. Hebert
has allowed only three goals in the four games.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' victory moved them three games over the .500 mark
(28-25-9) for the first time since they were 8-5-4 on Nov. 8, 1997.
It also moved them within five points of fourth-place Phoenix in
the Western Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat dropped the 10th-place Kings seven points back of
eighth-place San Jose with only 20 games left in the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings spent most of the first period in the Ducks' zone,
easily killed two penalties, held Paul Kariya and Selanne without a
shot and outshot Anaheim, 13-3. But Los Angeles still left the ice
trailing 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Sandstrom, who scored twice in the Ducks' win over the Kings on
Feb. 15, put a centering pass on the stick of Cullen. The Anaheim
center, who had beaten Donald Audette to the net, chipped the puck
past Fiset at 8:21 for his seventh goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The goal came on Anaheim's second shot of the game. The Ducks
wouldn't get another for 10 minutes, but they retained the lead
thanks to Hebert and some help from the post.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings players twice raised their sticks believing they had
tied the game. Hebert got just enough of Luc Robitaille's one-timer
from the right circle to keep it out of the net on a Kings' power
play, and Glen Murray's shot from the slot bounced off the right
post with 4{ minutes left in the first.
</P>
<P>
   The second period had to be nearly as frustrating. Once again
the Kings outshot the Ducks (13-9) and outchanced them, but Anaheim
still led 2-1 after 40 minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' No.1-ranked power play unit converted its third
chance of the game when Selanne turned a harmless looking play into
a goal.
</P>
<P>
   After the Ducks won a battle in neutral zone, the winger darted
around Sean O'Donnell, passed off to Travis Green and then stuffed
Green's return pass past Fiset at 8:21 on Anaheim's fourth shot of
the power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks managed just two shots at even strength in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne's 35th goal and 80th point of the season extended his
goal-scoring and point-scoring streaks to seven and 14. Meanwhile,
the Kings were huffing and puffing as they attempted to break the
spell that Hebert has held over them this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim goalie, who came into the game with .067 goals
against average and .978 save percentage in three games against the
Kings, stopped Robitaille, Sean Pronger and Rob Blake before Blake
finally beat Hebert low on the glove side from the right circle to
make it 2-1 at 13:32.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's third goal in four games was the Kings first in 131
minutes, 7 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Kings failed to help themselves on the power play.
Los Angeles, which is ranked 25th in the league, couldn't convert
any of its four opportunities in the first two periods.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What's the point in fishing anymore, some ponder,
when one can use an underwater video system to see the target from
the comfort of a boat?
</P>
<P>
   Why not just take a photo _ perhaps the ultimate in catch and
release?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, manufacturers say a big complaint from anglers who use
the underwater video systems is that they become so enthralled with
the images, they never take a cast.
</P>
<P>
   For others, something much more sinister lurks beneath the
technology, claiming it spits in the face of ``fair chase'' _ a
sacred yet unwritten code of ethics anglers and hunters abide by in
pursuit of game. In the wake of such pressing sports issues as
baseball's Mark McGwire-androstenedione controversy, some spout the
``shooting fish in a barrel'' metaphor in calling the use of the
devices cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents state the several brands of so-called ``fish TVs''
simply take some of the guesswork out of more traditional
fish-finding electronics, with which an inanimate blip on the
screen could just as easily well be a twig in the water as a trophy
bass. It is another way of doing your homework, they maintain, but
only the combination of skill and luck will put more fish in the
boat. After all, detractors also called calculators and rifle
scopes cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Fish TVs represent the progression of technology, but the
question beckons, what's next? The tricky query has spawned an
emotional clash between the Minnesota manufacturer of one video
system called Aqua-Vu and a politician from the same state with
designs on outlawing the use of the device when fishing lines are
in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying to ban them, just don't use them for fishing,''
said state Sen. Bob Lessard (D-International Falls, Minn.), a
veteran fishing guide and chairman of Minnesota's Senate
Environment and Natural Resources Committee. ``In other words, take
your damn line out of the water and enjoy the viewing. If you want
to fish, turn the camera off.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessard argues that in Minnesota _ where the number of fishing
licenses sold is second only to California, he said _ fishing
pressure is such a concern that throwing this technology into the
fray could further impede a dwindling resource.
</P>
<P>
   But is the use of fish TVs cheating?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I used one to catch fish, it would be `yes,''' said
Lessard, who guides walleye, Northern pike, lake trout and
smallmouth bass anglers 100 days a year and manages fishing camps
throughout Canada. ``Maybe I'm living in a dream world; maybe this
is the way our fishing society wants to evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think we should be teaching our kids fishing is supposed
to be sport with the thrill of the unknown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lessard proposed legislation to restrict use of
Aqua-Vu as a fishing instrument. It was tied to a more encompassing
bill that was passed by the state Senate but died in the House of
Representatives. The senator plans to reintroduce new legislation
this year and is wrestling with the details.
</P>
<P>
   That his device has become the focus of such controversy at
first surprised innovator Jeff Zernov, who put Aqua-Vu on the
market in February 1998 and topped more than $1.4 million in
first-year gross revenues. But realizing the consequences _
financial and otherwise _ should such restrictions be approved, he
chose to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to see legislation come into our sport, or any
area of business in the United States, that starts restricting
technology,'' said Zernov, who doled out $25,000 to lobbyists in an
effort to offset Lessard's campaign _ and likely will do the same
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like a nightmare. Like Freddy Krueger, he's
back,'' Zernov said of Lessard. ``We'll have to start writing
checks again.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics suggest Fish TVs will increase the take of game fish,
but when Zernov offered to hire an independent environmental-impact
research group and fund a study to the tune of $20,000, Minnesota
legislators rejected the offer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our technology or any technology is proven to increase the
success rate of anglers which results in increased harvest and a
decrease in the fishing population,'' Zernov said, ``then turn our
technology into a not-harvest tool so that if you are in possession
of a camera you cannot be in possession of fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Zernov maintains that Aqua-Vu increases one's fishing knowledge
by showing structure and other elements of fishing that no sonar
system will display. When that knowledge is applied properly, it
will increase angling success. Since the two elements are mutually
exclusive, he said, no guarantees are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't promote Aqua-Vu as a fishing tool, but as a teaching
tool,'' said Zernov, who also promotes ``absolute catch and
release.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Zernov promotes the device for use in a new ``sport''
he claims Aqua-Vu has spawned dubbed ``viewing,'' which ``expands
and enhances the appreciation of the underwater world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lessard, who admits his vocal criticism of Aqua-Vu is
tantamount to advertising, calls the pitch ``a smoke screen'' to
draw attention away from the fishing controversy. The
manufacturer's platform does seem suspect when the product
literature is rife with fishing applications and endorsements from
anglers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the publicity, Zernov said: ``I think the issue is
dying. People are learning that it is a non-impact tool.'' Perhaps
it is Zernov who is living in a dream world; Lessard isn't backing
off.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the end result, anglers may indeed be closer to
snapping photos of their quarry; Zernov plans to introduce by
Christmas a video system that allows users to record still-frame
images of what they see underwater. &QL;

   INGLEWOOD _ It was an uneasy marriage at first, the Lakers and
Dennis Rodman, and complicated by a change in the head of household
with the arrival of surrogate father-coach Kurt Rambis.
</P>

   But the Lakers promptly won four straight, and Lakers executive
Jerry West gave his blessing, pleased with what he called the
honeymoon period.

   They're now 5-0 in the Rodman-Rambis era after defeating the
Phoenix Suns for the second straight game, 101-95 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   And they have Danny Manning to thank in part for the victory.
Two nights earlier, Manning chided Kobe Bryant as ``too short'' to
guard him. Bryant took it personally, to the tune of 23 points in
the second half, leading a second straight comeback win.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with a game-high 32, plus several choice words to
Manning and the Suns bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like that man,'' Bryant said of Manning's putdown.
``People go and say things like that, I don't appreciate it too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Fired up by it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   It showed, as Bryant slammed down tomahawk dunks and shot glares
and words at Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he needed extra motivation, but there was also the
matter of keeping a winning streak intact and defending the home
court. The Lakers fell to a 34-25 deficit after one quarter and
trailed 55-49 at halftime before Bryant took over.
</P>
<P>
   His jumper failing him in a 2-for-7 first half, Bryant went to
the more direct approach to start the third quarter _ taking it to
the hole three straight times and scoring 11 consecutive points as
the Lakers gained the lead for the first time, 68-65.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to lose the game,'' he said. ``There was no way
in the world I was going to let them come back and have revenge on
our home court. Everybody on the team felt the same way, so we all
just picked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal added 27 points and Rodman grabbed a
season-high 17 rebounds. Clifford Robinson led the Suns with 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns led by three points early in the fourth when Rick Fox
brought the Lakers back with eight straight points, including two
3-pointers, to make it 81-78. Bryant followed with six straight to
complete a 16-5 run and give the Lakers an 89-81 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix never got closer than four points after that.
</P>
<P>
   All that remained for the Lakers was to ponder this sudden need
for come-from-behind wins. For the second straight game, they were
slow out of the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something we're concerned about,'' Rambis said. ``We
want to be known as a team that comes at you straight out of the
box.''
</P>
<P>
   Every marriage, of course, will have its rough spots. Rambis is
realistic about the length of this honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, the first loss is going to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That moment will have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis was fortunate not to have suffered his first career loss
two nights earlier in Phoenix, when the Lakers had to overcome an
eight-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Hard on his players, hard on himself, Rambis said he was
partially to blame for the near-defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't real happy with the way I prepared the team to play
in Phoenix,'' he said. ``We didn't get out of the gate really well.
We didn't execute the way we're capable of executing.... There's a
lot of things we didn't do, and I take responsibility for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was even less happy after I watched the videotape of the
game. I let (the players) know _ we won, but that doesn't mean that
everything's OK. We took a little step back.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems weren't solved in one game, but the progress is
there. Maybe all they need is another quip from Manning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I settled my score with him?'' Bryant said. ``I don't
know. Maybe he'll say something else.''
</P>

A TOUGH DAY FOR ROBINSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Kings coach Larry Robinson will leave the team
today to attend the funeral of his mother, who died late Tuesday in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long day,'' Robinson said following the Kings' 2-1
loss Wednesday night to the Mighty Ducks at the Pond. ``I got a
call early on this morning that one of my horses had a heart attack
and died on the farm (in Florida). A half hour later, I found out
my mother had died. I guess things can always get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death for Robinson's 78-year-old mother, Isobel,
was not disclosed. A wake is tentatively scheduled for Friday near
Ottawa, with the funeral planned for Saturday. Robinson probably
will rejoin the Kings on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is expected to miss home games tonight and Saturday
against Nashville and Calgary, respectively. Assistant coaches Jay
Leach and Rick Green will be in charge in Robinson's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay will take over my job behind the bench, and between him
and Greeny, they'll work out the game plans and lineups,'' Robinson
said. ``I'll leave that up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin out: The Ducks were without center Steve Rucchin, their
third-leading scorer with 22 goals and 56 points. According to the
team, Rucchin was sidelined with ``sinus problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin suffered a broken nose nearly two weeks ago in a game at
Calgary. Over the weekend, he took a shot to the head from San
Jose's Bryan Marchment, but Rucchin said he was not hit in the
nose. According to Rucchin, a combination of flu and the broken
nose was the reason he didn't play.
</P>
<P>
   Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg said: `His nose was basically
crushed in Calgary. I'm sure there's a combination of things going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Peaking Ducks: February was the best month in Ducks history and
a big reason was Teemu Selanne, who had 25 points and was the NHL's
player of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks posted a 10-3 record in February, besting their 7-3-4
record in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Of Selanne, Hartsburg said: ``He's a unique guy. He loves to be
around the guys and he loves playing. That combination is hard to
find. Teemu makes the most out of every day and I'm sure not every
day is the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kariya added: ``He's real good when things aren't going
well. He never gets down. He always has something to be happy
about, like getting a new car.''
</P>
<P>
   Selanne had at least one point in each of the Ducks' 13 games in
February, collecting a total of 12 goals and 13 assists. Selanne
has scored at least one goal in his last seven games and has at
least one point in 14 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   He scored the 300th goal of his career Saturday against San
Jose, reaching that milestone in 464 games, the sixth-fastest in
NHL history. Only Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Brett Hull, Mike
Bossy and Jari Kurri scored 300 goals in fewer games.
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Ducks defenseman Pascal Trepanier was struck by the
puck in the first period and left the game with a bruised left
leg.... Kariya recorded his 200th career assist on Selanne's
second-period goal.... The Ducks are 9-2-4 against Pacific Division
teams, and the Kings are 3-14 mark.... The Kings reassigned center
Eric Belanger to Springfield of the AHL. Belanger, one of the
Kings' top prospects, had been assigned last week to the Long Beach
Ice Dogs, for whom he appeared in one game.... Winger Vladimir
Tsyplakov, sidelined two weeks with a knee injury, has been skating
with a brace.... Kings center Yanic Perreault, who has six goals in
the last 52 games he's appeared in, was a healthy scratch.
Perreault was benched for the entire third period of Sunday's 1-0
loss in Dallas. Winger Sandy Moger also was a healthy scratch, and
defenseman Philippe Boucher missed the game because of a bout with
the flu.

PERFECT TIME FOR CYCLING IN MOUNTAINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LANGTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The visitor's view of Southern California includes
warm summers, palm trees swaying lazily in the breeze and a
Starbucks on every corner serving up iced lattes.
</P>
<P>
   Some chemical in the smog must block out their memories of the
San Fernando Valley's 100-plus degree days, ever-present brush-fire
potential and crowded freeways.
</P>
<P>
   But those of us who live here year-round know that the winter
and spring months are actually the best time of the year. Who says
the Southland only has one season?
</P>
<P>
   Late winter and early spring promise the explosion of
wildflowers, without the brain-melting heat. You're missing a
wonderful treat if you're not getting out to see the hillsides from
February through April.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is the best time of year to ride in the Santa
Monica Mountains,'' said Michael Thomas of Michael's Bicycles in
Newbury Park. ``The native plants, such as the California poppy and
lupine, are in full bloom, and the rains make the stream crossings
interesting ... just a little extra excitement. It may be a little
nippy when you first start riding, but in 10 or 15 minutes, it's
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't use winter as an excuse not to go riding. Peak daytime
temperatures can range in the high 60s and low 70s. A few wispy
clouds can help create a dramatic sunset of fiery red and orange
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there's the occasional rain shower, but it rarely lasts
long, and the mountain-biking trails usually dry up after a day or
two. Besides, they've turned our dull, brown hillsides into greener
pastures.
</P>
<P>
   Too many times I hear riding buddies beg off on an invitation to
an early-morning ride. Too bad. The air is crisp and clean, and the
trails are firm and full of traction. But take a few simple
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   For cycling, dressing ``in layers'' is essential. High-tech
garments made from breathable and moisture-wicking materials for
the upper body keep the rider warm without becoming a one-person
sauna.
</P>
<P>
   Lycra spandex leg tights come in a variety of thicknesses. One
tip: Go a little lighter rather than heavier. While it may seem
cold at the start of the ride, it only takes a few hundred yards to
get the heart and blood pumping. You'll be amazed at how quickly
you warm up.
</P>
<P>
   Bike shops and recreation outfitter carry a wide variety of warm
and comfortable clothing for daytime jaunts or night rides. The
gear should be similar to that of cross-country skiing; avoid baggy
clothing if at all possible.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget polypropylene socks, gloves and maybe a lightweight
headband with ear flaps to keep the chill out.
</P>
<P>
   If you're venturing into canyons near sea level early in the
morning, you might want to consider insulated gloves and a light
mask to cover the nose and lips. Usually the air temperature is not
enough to cause a problem, but windchill (don't forget, you're on a
bicycle traveling at speed) can cool extremities quickly.
</P>
<P>
   If your fingers become numb, it can hamper braking control. If
your toes become numb, it's just no fun. And trying to converse
during a chance encounter with the mountain biker of your dreams
can be difficult with frozen lips.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit to winter cycling is that you'll be that much
more fit come summer _ just in time to start taking off all those
layers. &QL;

DUCKS DEFEAT KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Kings were a desperate team heading into Wednesday
night's game at the Pond. The Mighty Ducks merely continue to play
like a desperate team even though their playoff chances look better
each day.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings played desperately, knowing their playoff chances grow
slimmer with every loss. But Guy Hebert and the Ducks were able to
hold off the Kings 2-1 before 17,174 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play very smart or very desperate,'' said Anaheim
coach Craig Hartsburg. ``The most desperate team usually wins, but
we were lucky to have great goaltending.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks certainly couldn't have planned it, but they played
their version of rope-a-dope. Anaheim landed two punches early
(goals by Matt Cullen and Teemu Selanne) and then spent the rest of
the night avoiding the Kings' counter punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We outplayed them, no doubt about it,'' said Kings coach Larry
Robinson. ``We deserved a lot better, but the biggest difference
was Hebert, he was stopping everything. He won that game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' defeat was a mere footnote to a sad day for Robinson,
who was informed that one of his horses had died of a heart attack,
then a short time later he received the news his mother had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had better days,'' said the Kings coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, who played passively much of the night, had to kill
off a Kings power play in the final two minutes and did so when
Tomas Sandstrom forced Donald Audette to take a penalty after
goalie Stephane Fiset had been pulled.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles outshot Anaheim 34-14, but the Kings lost their
fourth consecutive game to Hebert and the Ducks this season. Hebert
has allowed only three goals in the four games and defenseman Rob
Blake said it really didn't matter how his team played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we played a good game or a bad game, it's the same
result,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' victory moved them three games over the .500 mark
(28-25-9) for the first time since Nov. 8, 1997. It also moved them
within five points of fourth-place Phoenix in the Western
Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ducks knew the result could have been much different.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the game we were talking and said it was great we won,
but let's be honest, we didn't play very good,'' said Selanne. ``We
can't play like this very often. We aren't the Dallas Stars, we
have to play well every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those games you try to forget and be better the
next time.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat dropped the 10th-place Kings seven points back of
eighth-place San Jose with only 20 games left in the season. Los
Angeles (23-34-5) has already lost one more game than it did all
last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings spent most of the first period in the Ducks zone,
easily killing two penalties, holding Paul Kariya and Selanne
without a shot and outshooting Anaheim, 13-3. But Los Angeles still
left the ice trailing 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Sandstrom put a centering pass on the stick of Cullen and the
Anaheim center, who had beaten Audette to the net, chipped the puck
past Fiset at 8:21 for his seventh goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The goal came on Anaheim's second shot of the game. The Ducks
wouldn't get another for 10 minutes, but they retained the lead
thanks to Hebert and some help from the post.
</P>
<P>
   Kings players twice raised their sticks believing they had tied
the game. But Hebert got just enough of Luc Robitaille's power-play
one-timer from the right circle and Glen Murray's shot from the
slot bounced off the right post with 4{ minutes left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   The second period was nearly as frustrating. Once again the
Kings outshot the Ducks 13-6, but Anaheim still led 2-1 after 40
minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' No.1 ranked power play unit converted its third
chance of the game when Selanne turned a harmless looking play into
a goal.
</P>
<P>
   After the Ducks won a battle in neutral zone, the winger darted
around Sean O'Donnell, passed off to Travis Green and then stuffed
Green's return pass past Fiset at 8:21.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference was we couldn't score on the power play (0 for
5) and they need only one or two chances,'' said Robinson. ``We
haven't been giving up many goals, but we have to start get guys to
put the puck in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Selanne's 35th goal and 80th point of the season extended his
goal-scoring and point-scoring streaks to seven and 14. Meanwhile,
the Kings were huffing and puffing as they attempted to break the
spell that Hebert has held over them this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim goalie, who came into the game with .067 goals
against average and .978 save percentage in three games against the
Kings, stopped Robitaille, Sean Pronger and Rob Blake before Blake
finally beat Hebert low on the glove side from the right circle to
make it 2-1 at 13:32.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's third goal in four games was the Kings first in 131
minutes, 7 seconds.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Growing up in small-town Chicago
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share, via Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray,
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Lois Oller Nasados
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Not all Dreamsvilles are located in small towns. Mine, in the
late 1940s, existed on Chicago's Far Northwest Side near what is
now O'Hare International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard for youngsters of the '90s to imagine, but it was
a gentler time when children roamed freely through their
neighborhoods, and it took, if not a village, at least a whole
neighborhood to raise a child.
</P>
<P>
   This was never more appreciated than when we, the under-12
crowd, all gathered to play hide-and-seek.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite hiding places included the open space under the porches
of the old farmhouses that still survived amid the post-World War
II brick bungalows now lining the city's streets.
</P>
<P>
   In the yards of some houses ancient stands of lilac bushes,
twice the height of the average father, guarded back fences from
prying eyes, while overgrown honeysuckle vines hid the trellises
that supported them.
</P>
<P>
   Their fragrance would envelop us as securely as the branches
that hid us. The trunk of a giant maple tree could easily conceal a
child or two crouching behind it.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember ever being shooed away by a neighbor concerned
about a flower bed or a trampled lawn.
</P>
<P>
   I do remember being so snug and cozy in my fragrant nest that I
didn't want to leave, ignoring the rules of the game that required
me to sneak back to ``goal'' before ``It'' found me.
</P>
<P>
   Other children hid behind my grandpa's white picket fence or on
his big front porch. Hiding as far as possible from your own house
was an unspoken rule.
</P>
<P>
   Friends who have grown up in small towns or in the country often
offer sympathy that I was a child of the city. They're apt to smile
and shake their heads in disbelief when I tell them about the giant
maples, the ancient lilacs and the white picket fences that were a
part of my Chicago childhood.
</P>
<P>
   But we weren't so different.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday mornings we'd get up early, hoping to be first in
line at the neighborhood movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   We'd worry all week long if our current serial hero would
survive the horrors that the villain had planned for him.
</P>
<P>
   We'd laugh at the cartoon that seemed so magical in those days
when not everyone had a TV and the Cartoon Channel was
unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Of course all the boys wanted to be as brave as Roy and Gene,
and all the girls wanted to be as beautiful as Dale.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   If we were able to study all the Dreamsvilles _ east, west,
north and south _ we would find many unique features of each, but
we might also find that we have more in common than we ever
imagined.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: ... and that brings us to Pete Rose
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, March 7, 1999. Moving on commentary and
sports wires.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg

<TEXT>
<P>
   The people who run baseball, and those who report it, long ago
established a litany of hypocrisy that was further evidenced last
week by the election of Orlando Cepeda to baseball's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this is not about Mr. Cepeda. I felt all along that
this man they called ``the baby bull'' deserved his place in the
Hall of Fame, earning it on the playing fields.
</P>
<P>
   If it is not about Cepeda, then it is about Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rose made a mistake. Despite being one of the greatest
baseball players of all time, he is not in the Hall of Fame, not
even at its doorstep. Rose's impropriety was that he cheated on his
taxes and bet on baseball games, allegedly some involving the team
he was managing at the time.
</P>
<P>
   For this, Rose received a lifetime ban from baseball -- as well
as jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Switch back to Cepeda. He also made a mistake. His great career
ended, he returned to his native Puerto Rico and sold marijuana to
kids. He also did jail time, 10 months in the slammer.
</P>
<P>
   And when he got out, not even the Little League in Puerto Rico
would allow him to coach youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   But that was two decades ago and smarter heads have prevailed.
While Cepeda may not have been a model person then, he's done his
time and he's been rehabilitated. So, after years of being spurned
by the moralists who cover baseball games for the nation's media,
he's been permitted into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Good for Cepeda. But what about Rose?
</P>
<P>
   Is cheating on your taxes and betting on games a crime more
heinous than selling marijuana to children? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball writers, who have the responsibility for electing
former players into the Hall of Fame, are hiding behind some
regulation that says a player cannot be elected if he is under
suspension from Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Rose has attempted to be reinstated but the baseball
commissioner's office has rebuffed him. So the baseball writers
stick to their narrow bylaws. With any guts, they could change
their bylaws and tell the baseball commissioner's office what it
can do with its lifetime ban of Rose.
</P>
<P>
   One might ask why Cepeda did not also get a lifetime ban, but I
won't because I think a lifetime ban is absurd, leaves no room for
rehabilitation or re-examination. Cepeda today is not the marijuana
advocate he once was; he is, in fact, a man who speaks to youth
groups about the pitfalls of the drug culture.
</P>
<P>
   How many decades is it that baseball fans have argued against
the lifetime ban imposed on the great Shoeless Joe Jackson for
whatever role he might have played in the infamous 1919 Chicago
Black Sox scandal? (How could someone who batted .375 and committed
no errors in the 1919 World Series be part of a plot to
intentionally lose?)
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has an amazing elasticity _ when it wants to. It can
keep a Rose away from his deserved honor for decades but can allow
a franchise to pick itself up and steal away in the middle of the
night, as it did the franchises in Brooklyn and Manhattan four
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who suffers from a bombastic personality that I am certain
works against him, feels he has served out his penalty, as did
Cepeda. So do I.
</P>
<P>
   It is inconceivable that baseball and the baseball writers can
continue this constraint against Rose indefinitely. If anything,
the Cepeda experience and subsequent election to the Hall of Fame
should open their eyes to their own hypocrisy.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Time expiring on term limits
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It begins to look as though what we have here is a bad idea
whose time is passing. Sometimes you get lucky.
</P>
<P>
   A number of U.S. House members who had been elected promising to
quit after three or four terms see the clock swinging around on
them, like Death's own scythe. It perhaps will not astonish you to
find that a number, upon sober reflection and in consideration of
the best interests of the republic, are leaning to the proposition
that the nation should not be denied an opportunity for their
further ministrations.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the 10 whose time is up next year are waffling.
</P>
<P>
   Just as well. The representatives are reneging on a pledge that
helped to elect them in the first place; indeed, that made the
difference in boosting some into office. Even so, let's, as it
were, eschew cynicism and assume their change of heart is genuine,
as much a surprise to them as to their constituents, and is
grounded in the wisdom of experience.
</P>
<P>
   It is no bad thing if a number of so-called self-limited members
have come to understand just why that was a boneheaded idea and are
now willing to take their case to the electorate. If most voters
are not persuaded, then the incumbents will be retired anyway,
instead of retiring _ which is why, all along, terms limits have
been unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The term-limit fad blazed in the early and mid-'90s. Most of the
candidates who took the pledge did so in '92 and '94, and in the
first heat of the issue 18 states adopted term limits for their
legislatures. A few still are straggling in. Alaska did last year.
Referenda are scheduled in Mississippi and Kansas next year.
</P>
<P>
   The hiss you hear, however, is the steam going out of this
issue. Large majorities, if polled, still like the idea, but mainly
on a since-you-asked basis. They aren't taking to the streets.
Indeed, the pioneer reneger, Scott McInnis, R-Colo., saying he had
learned how important seniority is, was re-elected with 70 percent
of the vote last year.
</P>
<P>
   And it takes a constitutional amendment to term-limit Congress,
so forget that. In the key 1995 House votes, the GOP leadership
brought several proposals to the floor, assuring none would get a
majority but letting every pro-limit member vote for one as a totem
of his or her earnest. Now, that was cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good amount of churn in Congress over any 10-year
period and the 1992 Republican boom showed there can be a lot even
on one cycle. Still, dead wood does pile up and incumbents have too
much of a running start. A properly concerned public, rather than
giving away its options in favor of mechanical turnover, would
demand campaign funding reform that could give challengers a better
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Term-limit enthusiasts like to speak of ``citizen legislators''
as against ``professional politicians.'' Experience isn't
everything, but how often would you drive your sputtering car past
the garage with the ``Licensed mechanic on duty'' sign for the one
with a sign saying ``Guy here thinks maybe he can fix your car''?

SUMMARY -- No. 2525 -- March 4, 1999 We are offering the following
articles for sale. Please contact us for availability your country.
Best regards, Karl Horwitz
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. THE LONELY SUPERPOWER The unipolar moment has passed. Even
old allies stubbornly resist American demands, while many other
nations view U.S. policy and ideals as openly hostile to their own.
Washington is blind to the fact that it no longer enjoys the
dominance it had at the end of the Cold War. It must relearn the
game of international politics as a major power, not a superpower,
and make compromises. U.S. policymaking should reflect rational
calculations of power rather than a wish list of arrogant,
unilateralist demands. By Samuel P. Huntington. Foreign Affairs
magazine. 1,800 words. 2. IN INDIA, CHILDHOOD IS FOR SALE Sonia is
12 and blind; not surprisingly, she has never played with
footballs, but from the age of six she was forced to stitch them,
eight hours a day, seven days a week. At the end of each day, she
had not earned enough to buy even a loaf of bread for her family.
Still, Sonia was one of the lucky ones. Kailash Satyarthi, who has
been fighting child labour for the last two decades, raided the
factory - media in tow - where Sonia and many other children
worked. Sonia was finally given back her childhood. The crusade
Kailash has launched against child servitude in South Asia has seen
him coping with as many disheartening defeats as victories. By Soma
Wadhwa. Changemakers.net Journal. 2,000 words. 3. FEELINGS vs.
BRAINPOWER The mythical hero of Silicon Valley is the nerd - a
brain trapped inside a geeky-looking body. Research now suggests
otherwise : the way to get ahead in the age of the knowledge worker
is not through raw brainpower but by harnessing your emotions.
Interview with Daniel Goleman, author of the 1995 blockbuster
``Emotional Intelligence.'' By Jeff Greenwald. Wired magazine.
1,500 words. (Q&AMP;A format.)
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
INTIMATE ENGINEERING When Diane Kelly describes her unusual field
of study, her listeners, especially the men, tend to squirm. That's
because she spends her days doing experiments on the penises of
mammals from rats to armadillos. She is, to her knowledge, the
first and only scientist to study the biomechanics of the male
organ - in other words, the principles of engineering and physics
that enable the penis to do what it's supposed to do. By Mary
Roach. From Discover magazine. 1,000 words + photos. 
____________________________________________________________________
_____ 5. EUROPE, BEYOND THE BUREAUCRATS A lot has changed, in
everyday life, everyday attitudes, everyday assumptions and
expectations since Europe was only a geographical world. By Flora
Lewis. 800 words.
________________________________________________________ 6. STUDIES
FIND SIMPLER TREATMENT CUTS HIV INFECTIONS
</P>
<P>
   IN NEWBORNS Roughly 1,600 children become infected by HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS, each day (or about 600,000 a year.) Ninety
per cent of these children live in developing nations, most
contracting the infection from their mothers during pregnancy,
delivery or while breast-feeding. Treatment available in developed
nations can cut the risk of infection by about two-thirds, but it
is too expensive and complex to be provided in most developing
nations. Now a far shorter, simpler and less expensive treatment
protocol may have been found which could cut mother-to-child
transmission of HIV by one-third to one-half. By Michael McCarthy.
The Lancet News Service. 1,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
FROM MEDICAL TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE : A. FIGHTING MENSTRUAL MIGRAINE
Special strategies can help women avoid menstrual migraines or
substantially lessen the severity of these headaches. 500 words. B.
DETECTING SKIN CANCER Underscoring the need for people at risk for
skin cancer to have regular checkups, researchers report that
doctors are more likely than patients to detect melanoma in its
earliest stages. 500 words. C. YOGURT MAY BRING DOWN BLOOD
CHOLESTEROL Many people eat yoghurt for its bone-fortifying
calcium, but new research suggests that it may be good for the
heart as well. 500 words. D. STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN HAIR COULD
SIGNAL BREAST CANCER Hair-sample tests could one day be used to
screen women for breast cancer. 500 words. 8. NEW THERAPY HELPING
SMOKERS QUIT A new approach combining an anti-depressant,
nicotine-replacement and counseling is sharply increasing the
chance of success of people who are trying to give up smoking. By
Holcomb B. Noble. New York Times Science Times. 1,500 words +

   Microbiologist Rita Colwell was at first excoriated by the
scientific world for her ideas about the behavior of the bacterium
that causes cholera. But research has borne out her notion that the
bacterium can lie dormant in the environment and then erupt.
Previously, scientists thought that a human host was necessary. Now
Colwell is focusing on helping to prevent major outbreaks of
cholera in poor communities with contaminated drinking water by
using a filter fashioned of sari cloth. Catherine Dold is a
free-lance writer who lives in Boulder, Colo.

   Dr. Robert Norman, a dermatologist, was called in by a medical

the 28-year-old patient was peeling off her entire body. Her body
was a blanket of red. She looked as if she had been badly burned in
a fire. Norman had seen the rare affliction twice before, though
never such a severe case. It was toxic epidermal necrolysis, or
TEN, an extreme allergic reaction to a drug that is fatal in 30
percent of cases. In this fascinating feature, Norman explains how

   Dr. Robert Norman, a dermatologist, was called in by a medical
colleague to help solve a medical mystery. The top layer of skin of
the 28-year-old patient was peeling off her entire body. Her body
was a blanket of red. She looked as if she had been badly burned in
a fire. Norman had seen the rare affliction twice before, though
never such a severe case. It was toxic epidermal necrolysis, or
TEN, an extreme allergic reaction to a drug that is fatal in 30
percent of cases. In this fascinating feature, Norman explains how
he treated the case.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Last year microbiologist Rita Colwell was visiting a rural
village in Bangladesh with a crew from a Maryland public television
station. The crew asked Colwell to show them a new method she had
devised for filtering plankton and bacteria from drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras focused on a woman standing at the edge of the local
``tank'' _ a large pond that in one corner is used as a latrine and
in the other as a source of drinking water. In traditional fashion,
the woman bent down and dipped her clay bottle into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``After she collected the water, we poured it into a clear
beaker and held it up to the sunlight,'' recalls Colwell. ``You
could see the brown discoloration, things swimming in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next Colwell asked the woman to collect water again, this time
while holding a few layers of sari cloth over the mouth of the
clear beaker.
</P>
<P>
   When the sample was held up to the light, the water was
practically clear. Minutes later the film crew, wanting some
background footage, asked the woman to walk to the tank again,
collect some more water, walk back to her home and take a drink.
</P>
<P>
   She did as they asked, but stopped short of drinking the water.
She explained through a translator that, having just seen the
results of the simple experiment, she no longer wished to drink
unfiltered water.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple demonstration, but a pivotal moment for Colwell.
After years of studying Vibrio cholerae, a notorious bacterium that
can contaminate unchlorinated water supplies and cause massive
epidemics of sickness and death, she could see that one of her
ideas to help prevent the disease just might work.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades Colwell has labored in the field and
in the laboratory to tease out the ecology of this tiny microbe.
Her discoveries have overturned some long-held notions about how V.
cholerae travels the world, how it is transmitted to humans and
where it lurks in the years between outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes to use these ecological lessons to prevent future
outbreaks, or at least to blunt their impact.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Colwell became the director of the National Science
Foundation, in Arlington, Va., after spending 25 years at the
University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute _ the last 10 as its
president. She had spent most of those years convincing the
scientific world that V. cholerae might not behave as everyone had
assumed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s she and her colleagues isolated the cholera
bacterium from the Chesapeake Bay. At the time, the claim was
outrageous. Nobody believed that V. cholerae could persist in the
environment without a human host, and no cholera outbreaks were
occurring anywhere near the Chesapeake. Indeed, there had been no
cholera epidemics anywhere in the United States since 1911.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were excoriated,'' she sighs. ```Nonsense,' they said.
`It's only transmitted from person to person.'''
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred papers later, her ideas have finally gained
acceptance. One peer now calls her work a paradigm shift in
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have learned much about how cholera is transmitted by
feces, food and water. But an enigma remained: Where did the
bacteria go between epidemics?
</P>
<P>
   Rita Colwell suspected that V. cholerae persisted in an
environmental reservoir _ living somewhere far from its human hosts
_ and that the reservoir was the ocean. Maybe, she thought, the
problem was simply that no one could see them. Perhaps for some
reason the bacteria weren't always detectable by traditional
culture methods _ that is, they couldn't be grown in a petri dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Doggone it, I wonder if it goes into a dormant
state,''' says Colwell.
</P>
<P>
   Her next clue came from Louisiana. In the late 1970s a small
cholera outbreak popped up near New Orleans among a few people who
had eaten crab from a local bayou.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back and took water samples,'' says Colwell. But this
time, rather than attempting to grow a conventional culture,
Colwell tried a new detection method. The test used an antibody
that would latch onto a key component of the bacterium's cell
membrane. Linked to that antibody was a molecule that would light
up under ultraviolet light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a little tribal dance around the microscope,'' she
says, recalling the excitement of her research team. ``You could
see the little devils because they fluoresce bright green. I'll
never forget the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Colwell's detractors dismissed her findings as ``Colwell's
ghosts.'' But later tests confirmed her suspicion that V. cholerae
could exist naturally in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes are the right conditions _ whether in a human gut
or in the environment _ for V. cholerae to come out of dormancy,
multiply and spread its misery. No one knows exactly what
conditions awaken the bacteria from their metabolic slumber.
</P>
<P>
   The critical factor could be anything from the temperature of
the water to the amount of salt. Colwell has already stumbled
across one correlation that she says gave her chills. A graph of
the seasonal peaks in sea-surface temperatures in the Bay of
Bengal, gleaned from satellite data, almost exactly matches a graph
of the seasonal peaks in admissions for cholera in nearby
hospitals. Some four to six weeks after the sea temperature goes
up, so do cholera admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Colwell and HUQ are now trying to determine the exact
relationships between sea temperatures, phytoplankton blooms,
cholera cases and everything in between. If the connections become
clear, says Colwell, the models might be used to create a global
cholera warning system.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Colwell's work could have a local impact. Her
sari-cloth filter, which so impressed the young woman in
Bangladesh, is now being tested by 4,000 families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't remove all the cholera bacteria,'' says Colwell.
``But the numbers go way down. Therefore we expect to be able to
curb the massive epidemics.''

<P>
   Last year microbiologist Rita Colwell was visiting a rural
village in Bangladesh with a crew from a Maryland public television
station. The crew asked Colwell to show them a new method she had
devised for filtering plankton and bacteria from drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras focused on a woman standing at the edge of the local
``tank'' _ a large pond that in one corner is used as a latrine and
in the other as a source of drinking water. In traditional fashion,
the woman bent down and dipped her clay bottle into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``After she collected the water, we poured it into a clear
beaker and held it up to the sunlight,'' recalls Colwell. ``You
could see the brown discoloration, things swimming in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next Colwell asked the woman to collect water again, this time
while holding a few layers of sari cloth over the mouth of the
clear beaker.
</P>
<P>
   When the sample was held up to the light, the water was
practically clear. Minutes later the film crew, wanting some
background footage, asked the woman to walk to the tank again,
collect some more water, walk back to her home and take a drink.
</P>
<P>
   She did as they asked, but stopped short of drinking the water.
She explained through a translator that, having just seen the
results of the simple experiment, she no longer wished to drink
unfiltered water.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple demonstration, but a pivotal moment for Colwell.
After years of studying Vibrio cholerae, a notorious bacterium that
can contaminate unchlorinated water supplies and cause massive
epidemics of sickness and death, she could see that one of her
ideas to help prevent the disease just might work.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades Colwell has labored in the field and
in the laboratory to tease out the ecology of this tiny microbe.
Her discoveries have overturned some long-held notions about how V.
cholerae travels the world, how it is transmitted to humans and
where it lurks in the years between outbreaks.
</P>

   She hopes to use these ecological lessons to prevent future

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   My friend Bill Cook, a primary care physician, called me one
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've admitted a patient, a 28-year-old woman,'' he said.
``She's losing her skin. Can you come and take a look at her?''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the patient, Mary Grove, had come to his
office the day before, complaining that her skin had suddenly begun
to peel. She felt strange _ weak and tender _ and her eyes and
mouth felt irritated.
</P>
<P>
   I am a dermatologist, and from Bill's description I had a good
idea of what was wrong with Mary.
</P>
<P>
   I found Mary in her bed, staring at the flickering images on the
TV. When I introduced myself she smiled and said, ``Hey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to take a look at your skin,'' I said, ``if that's
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's left of it,'' she offered.
</P>
<P>
   Her skin was a blanket of red. The top layer was sloughing off
her face, neck, trunk, legs and feet in large sheets like wet
wallpaper. Scattered over her body were a few islands of
normal-looking skin.
</P>
<P>
   I had seen two other patients with this disorder, but neither of
this severity. To determine the extent of the damage, I took a look
at the mucous membranes of her mouth, genitals and eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whaddaya think, Doctor?'' she slurred. Apparently, she was
groggy from her pain medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that you've had a fairly severe reaction to a
medicine you took,'' I said. ``It doesn't happen very often, but
when it does, it can be a real challenge to care for. But we're
going to make sure you get the care you need to recover. Have you
taken any medicines in the last few weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I take something for my knees. It's like a pain pill, but it
never gave me a problem before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else?''
</P>
<P>
   She paused, her eyes focusing somewhere on the ground. ``I did
have an earache, and I took something I found in my cabinet. I'd
have to check it. I remember one of the kids or somebody used it
when they had an infection and it helped, so I took it for a few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember the last time you had a minor burn? Do you
remember how a small part of your skin peeled off? The same
reaction extended all across Mary's body. But Mary's injury hadn't
been caused by anything external, like a burn. The mutiny arose
from within.
</P>
<P>
   I explained to Mary that she was probably suffering an extreme
and unusual allergic reaction to one of the drugs she had taken.
Her immune system, for unknown reasons, viewed it as an enemy and
initiated a defense against it. The reaction _ called toxic
epidermal necrolysis, or TEN _ is poorly understood, but the
devastation of the skin resembles burn injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to watch you very carefully over the next several days
to make sure you don't get an infection or lose too much of your
vital fluids,'' I explained.
</P>
<P>
   I took a sample of skin and sent it to a pathologist. Then I
explained to Mary's nurse the care she would need and called Bill
Cook to put together a treatment plan. We would stabilize her in
the internal medicine unit of our hospital and then closely monitor
her condition.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of her hospitalization, I got back the
pathologist's report, which confirmed my diagnosis. On the third
day of hospitalization, we moved Mary to the burn unit, where the
staff is trained to care for patients with severe skin loss. They
carefully removed the dead skin and applied a loose gauze dressing
saturated with antibacterial agents to the denuded skin surface.
</P>
<P>
   The staff made sure she was getting enough fluids and nutrients
and carefully monitored her fluid intake and urine output. They
also kept a close watch on her general condition and vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was one of about 500 cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis in
the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disorder is considered rare, its frequency may be
underestimated because mild cases probably go unreported. Most
reported cases, like Mary's, pop up one to three weeks after a new
drug is taken. The onset is rapid and in some cases can be terribly
severe. Patients can lose their entire epidermis _ the uppermost of
the skin's three layers _ within about 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest threat to patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis
is not the damage to the skin itself but the manner in which that
damage increases a patient's vulnerability to infection. When the
epidermis is destroyed, the body surface is a standing invitation
to pathogens. Roughly 30 percent of patients diagnosed with TEN die
_ most often because infection has spread into their bloodstreams.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was, in this respect, fortunate. Her internal symptoms were
limited to some inflammation in her mouth. A topical ointment
helped heal and anesthetize the tender inflamed sites.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis for TEN depends on how quickly the disorder is
diagnosed and treated. The peak of the disease (by the third day,
in Mary's case) bears the highest threat, and the fate of the
patient often hangs in the balance for one or more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the surviving patients have residual and
potentially disabling eye lesions, which can include scarring of
the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   Mary's chances for recovery were good, given that we identified
and treated the disorder quickly. After a week in the hospital Mary
improved, and within a month she was up and around.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes appeared to have been spared any chronic harm. She bore
only a slight visible trace of the vast tissue destruction: a small
spot of scar tissue on her left thigh.

<P>
   Last year microbiologist Rita Colwell was visiting a rural
village in Bangladesh with a crew from a Maryland public television
station. The crew asked Colwell to show them a new method she had
devised for filtering plankton and bacteria from drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras focused on a woman standing at the edge of the local
``tank'' _ a large pond that in one corner is used as a latrine and
in the other as a source of drinking water. In traditional fashion,
the woman bent down and dipped her clay bottle into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``After she collected the water, we poured it into a clear
beaker and held it up to the sunlight,'' recalls Colwell. ``You
could see the brown discoloration, things swimming in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next Colwell asked the woman to collect water again, this time
while holding a few layers of sari cloth over the mouth of the
clear beaker.
</P>
<P>
   When the sample was held up to the light, the water was
practically clear. Minutes later the film crew, wanting some
background footage, asked the woman to walk to the tank again,
collect some more water, walk back to her home and take a drink.
</P>
<P>
   She did as they asked, but stopped short of drinking the water.
She explained through a translator that, having just seen the
results of the simple experiment, she no longer wished to drink
unfiltered water.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple demonstration, but a pivotal moment for Colwell.
After years of studying Vibrio cholerae, a notorious bacterium that
can contaminate unchlorinated water supplies and cause massive
epidemics of sickness and death, she could see that one of her
ideas to help prevent the disease just might work.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades Colwell has labored in the field and
in the laboratory to tease out the ecology of this tiny microbe.
Her discoveries have overturned some long-held notions about how V.
cholerae travels the world, how it is transmitted to humans and
where it lurks in the years between outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes to use these ecological lessons to prevent future
outbreaks, or at least to blunt their impact.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Colwell became the director of the National Science
Foundation, in Arlington, Va., after spending 25 years at the
University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute _ the last 10 as its
president. She had spent most of those years convincing the
scientific world that V. cholerae might not behave as everyone had
assumed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s she and her colleagues isolated the cholera
bacterium from the Chesapeake Bay. At the time, the claim was
outrageous. Nobody believed that V. cholerae could persist in the
environment without a human host, and no cholera outbreaks were
occurring anywhere near the Chesapeake. Indeed, there had been no
cholera epidemics anywhere in the United States since 1911.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were excoriated,'' she sighs. ```Nonsense,' they said.
`It's only transmitted from person to person.'''
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred papers later, her ideas have finally gained
acceptance. One peer now calls her work a paradigm shift in
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have learned much about how cholera is transmitted by
feces, food and water. But an enigma remained: Where did the
bacteria go between epidemics?
</P>
<P>
   Rita Colwell suspected that V. cholerae persisted in an
environmental reservoir _ living somewhere far from its human hosts
_ and that the reservoir was the ocean. Maybe, she thought, the
problem was simply that no one could see them. Perhaps for some
reason the bacteria weren't always detectable by traditional
culture methods _ that is, they couldn't be grown in a petri dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Doggone it, I wonder if it goes into a dormant
state,''' says Colwell.
</P>
<P>
   Her next clue came from Louisiana. In the late 1970s a small
cholera outbreak popped up near New Orleans among a few people who
had eaten crab from a local bayou.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back and took water samples,'' says Colwell. But this
time, rather than attempting to grow a conventional culture,
Colwell tried a new detection method. The test used an antibody
that would latch onto a key component of the bacterium's cell
membrane. Linked to that antibody was a molecule that would light
up under ultraviolet light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a little tribal dance around the microscope,'' she
says, recalling the excitement of her research team. ``You could
see the little devils because they fluoresce bright green. I'll
never forget the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Colwell's detractors dismissed her findings as ``Colwell's
ghosts.'' But later tests confirmed her suspicion that V. cholerae
could exist naturally in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes are the right conditions _ whether in a human gut
or in the environment _ for V. cholerae to come out of dormancy,
multiply and spread its misery. No one knows exactly what
conditions awaken the bacteria from their metabolic slumber.
</P>
<P>
   The critical factor could be anything from the temperature of
the water to the amount of salt. Colwell has already stumbled
across one correlation that she says gave her chills. A graph of
the seasonal peaks in sea-surface temperatures in the Bay of
Bengal, gleaned from satellite data, almost exactly matches a graph
of the seasonal peaks in admissions for cholera in nearby
hospitals. Some four to six weeks after the sea temperature goes
up, so do cholera admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Colwell and HUQ are now trying to determine the exact
relationships between sea temperatures, phytoplankton blooms,
cholera cases and everything in between. If the connections become
clear, says Colwell, the models might be used to create a global
cholera warning system.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Colwell's work could have a local impact. Her
sari-cloth filter, which so impressed the young woman in
Bangladesh, is now being tested by 4,000 families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't remove all the cholera bacteria,'' says Colwell.
``But the numbers go way down. Therefore we expect to be able to
curb the massive epidemics.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   My friend Bill Cook, a primary care physician, called me one
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've admitted a patient, a 28-year-old woman,'' he said.
``She's losing her skin. Can you come and take a look at her?''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the patient, Mary Grove, had come to his
office the day before, complaining that her skin had suddenly begun
to peel. She felt strange _ weak and tender _ and her eyes and
mouth felt irritated.
</P>
<P>
   I am a dermatologist, and from Bill's description I had a good
idea of what was wrong with Mary.
</P>
<P>
   I found Mary in her bed, staring at the flickering images on the
TV. When I introduced myself she smiled and said, ``Hey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to take a look at your skin,'' I said, ``if that's
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's left of it,'' she offered.
</P>
<P>
   Her skin was a blanket of red. The top layer was sloughing off
her face, neck, trunk, legs and feet in large sheets like wet
wallpaper. Scattered over her body were a few islands of
normal-looking skin.
</P>
<P>
   I had seen two other patients with this disorder, but neither of
this severity. To determine the extent of the damage, I took a look
at the mucous membranes of her mouth, genitals and eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whaddaya think, Doctor?'' she slurred. Apparently, she was
groggy from her pain medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that you've had a fairly severe reaction to a
medicine you took,'' I said. ``It doesn't happen very often, but
when it does, it can be a real challenge to care for. But we're
going to make sure you get the care you need to recover. Have you
taken any medicines in the last few weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I take something for my knees. It's like a pain pill, but it
never gave me a problem before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else?''
</P>
<P>
   She paused, her eyes focusing somewhere on the ground. ``I did
have an earache, and I took something I found in my cabinet. I'd
have to check it. I remember one of the kids or somebody used it
when they had an infection and it helped, so I took it for a few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember the last time you had a minor burn? Do you
remember how a small part of your skin peeled off? The same
reaction extended all across Mary's body. But Mary's injury hadn't
been caused by anything external, like a burn. The mutiny arose
from within.
</P>
<P>
   I explained to Mary that she was probably suffering an extreme
and unusual allergic reaction to one of the drugs she had taken.
Her immune system, for unknown reasons, viewed it as an enemy and
initiated a defense against it. The reaction _ called toxic
epidermal necrolysis, or TEN _ is poorly understood, but the
devastation of the skin resembles burn injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to watch you very carefully over the next several days
to make sure you don't get an infection or lose too much of your
vital fluids,'' I explained.
</P>
<P>
   I took a sample of skin and sent it to a pathologist. Then I
explained to Mary's nurse the care she would need and called Bill
Cook to put together a treatment plan. We would stabilize her in
the internal medicine unit of our hospital and then closely monitor
her condition.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of her hospitalization, I got back the
pathologist's report, which confirmed my diagnosis. On the third
day of hospitalization, we moved Mary to the burn unit, where the
staff is trained to care for patients with severe skin loss. They
carefully removed the dead skin and applied a loose gauze dressing
saturated with antibacterial agents to the denuded skin surface.
</P>
<P>
   The staff made sure she was getting enough fluids and nutrients
and carefully monitored her fluid intake and urine output. They
also kept a close watch on her general condition and vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was one of about 500 cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis in
the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disorder is considered rare, its frequency may be
underestimated because mild cases probably go unreported. Most
reported cases, like Mary's, pop up one to three weeks after a new
drug is taken. The onset is rapid and in some cases can be terribly
severe. Patients can lose their entire epidermis _ the uppermost of
the skin's three layers _ within about 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest threat to patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis
is not the damage to the skin itself but the manner in which that
damage increases a patient's vulnerability to infection. When the
epidermis is destroyed, the body surface is a standing invitation
to pathogens. Roughly 30 percent of patients diagnosed with TEN die
_ most often because infection has spread into their bloodstreams.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was, in this respect, fortunate. Her internal symptoms were
limited to some inflammation in her mouth. A topical ointment
helped heal and anesthetize the tender inflamed sites.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis for TEN depends on how quickly the disorder is
diagnosed and treated. The peak of the disease (by the third day,
in Mary's case) bears the highest threat, and the fate of the
patient often hangs in the balance for one or more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the surviving patients have residual and
potentially disabling eye lesions, which can include scarring of
the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   Mary's chances for recovery were good, given that we identified
and treated the disorder quickly. After a week in the hospital Mary
improved, and within a month she was up and around.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes appeared to have been spared any chronic harm. She bore
only a slight visible trace of the vast tissue destruction: a small
spot of scar tissue on her left thigh.

   I explained to Mary that she was probably suffering an extreme
and unusual allergic reaction to one of the drugs she had taken.
Her immune system, for unknown reasons, viewed it as an enemy and
initiated a defense against it. The reaction _ called toxic
epidermal necrolysis, or TEN _ is poorly understood, but the
devastation of the skin resembles burn injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to watch you very carefully over the next several days
to make sure you don't get an infection or lose too much of your
vital fluids,'' I explained.
</P>
<P>
   I took a sample of skin and sent it to a pathologist. Then I
explained to Mary's nurse the care she would need and called Bill
Cook to put together a treatment plan. We would stabilize her in
the internal medicine unit of our hospital and then closely monitor
her condition.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of her hospitalization, I got back the
pathologist's report, which confirmed my diagnosis. On the third
day of hospitalization, we moved Mary to the burn unit, where the
staff is trained to care for patients with severe skin loss. They
carefully removed the dead skin and applied a loose gauze dressing
saturated with antibacterial agents to the denuded skin surface.
</P>
<P>
   The staff made sure she was getting enough fluids and nutrients
and carefully monitored her fluid intake and urine output. They
also kept a close watch on her general condition and vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was one of about 500 cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis in
the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disorder is considered rare, its frequency may be
underestimated because mild cases probably go unreported. Most
reported cases, like Mary's, pop up one to three weeks after a new
drug is taken. The onset is rapid and in some cases can be terribly
severe. Patients can lose their entire epidermis _ the uppermost of
the skin's three layers _ within about 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest threat to patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis
is not the damage to the skin itself but the manner in which that
damage increases a patient's vulnerability to infection. When the
epidermis is destroyed, the body surface is a standing invitation
to pathogens. Roughly 30 percent of patients diagnosed with TEN die
_ most often because infection has spread into their bloodstreams.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was, in this respect, fortunate. Her internal symptoms were
limited to some inflammation in her mouth. A topical ointment
helped heal and anesthetize the tender inflamed sites.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis for TEN depends on how quickly the disorder is
diagnosed and treated. The peak of the disease (by the third day,
in Mary's case) bears the highest threat, and the fate of the
patient often hangs in the balance for one or more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the surviving patients have residual and
potentially disabling eye lesions, which can include scarring of
the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   Mary's chances for recovery were good, given that we identified
and treated the disorder quickly. After a week in the hospital Mary
improved, and within a month she was up and around.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes appeared to have been spared any chronic harm. She bore
only a slight visible trace of the vast tissue destruction: a small
spot of scar tissue on her left thigh.

<P>
   Last year microbiologist Rita Colwell was visiting a rural
village in Bangladesh with a crew from a Maryland public television
station. The crew asked Colwell to show them a new method she had
devised for filtering plankton and bacteria from drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras focused on a woman standing at the edge of the local
``tank'' _ a large pond that in one corner is used as a latrine and
in the other as a source of drinking water. In traditional fashion,
the woman bent down and dipped her clay bottle into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``After she collected the water, we poured it into a clear
beaker and held it up to the sunlight,'' recalls Colwell. ``You
could see the brown discoloration, things swimming in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next Colwell asked the woman to collect water again, this time
while holding a few layers of sari cloth over the mouth of the
clear beaker.
</P>
<P>
   When the sample was held up to the light, the water was
practically clear. Minutes later the film crew, wanting some
background footage, asked the woman to walk to the tank again,
collect some more water, walk back to her home and take a drink.
</P>
<P>
   She did as they asked, but stopped short of drinking the water.
She explained through a translator that, having just seen the
results of the simple experiment, she no longer wished to drink
unfiltered water.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple demonstration, but a pivotal moment for Colwell.
After years of studying Vibrio cholerae, a notorious bacterium that
can contaminate unchlorinated water supplies and cause massive
epidemics of sickness and death, she could see that one of her
ideas to help prevent the disease just might work.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades Colwell has labored in the field and
in the laboratory to tease out the ecology of this tiny microbe.
Her discoveries have overturned some long-held notions about how V.
cholerae travels the world, how it is transmitted to humans and
where it lurks in the years between outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes to use these ecological lessons to prevent future
outbreaks, or at least to blunt their impact.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Colwell became the director of the National Science
Foundation, in Arlington, Va., after spending 25 years at the
University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute _ the last 10 as its
president. She had spent most of those years convincing the
scientific world that V. cholerae might not behave as everyone had
assumed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s she and her colleagues isolated the cholera
bacterium from the Chesapeake Bay. At the time, the claim was
outrageous. Nobody believed that V. cholerae could persist in the
environment without a human host, and no cholera outbreaks were
occurring anywhere near the Chesapeake. Indeed, there had been no
cholera epidemics anywhere in the United States since 1911.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were excoriated,'' she sighs. ```Nonsense,' they said.
`It's only transmitted from person to person.'''
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred papers later, her ideas have finally gained
acceptance. One peer now calls her work a paradigm shift in
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have learned much about how cholera is transmitted by
feces, food and water. But an enigma remained: Where did the
bacteria go between epidemics?
</P>
<P>
   Rita Colwell suspected that V. cholerae persisted in an
environmental reservoir _ living somewhere far from its human hosts
_ and that the reservoir was the ocean. Maybe, she thought, the
problem was simply that no one could see them. Perhaps for some
reason the bacteria weren't always detectable by traditional
culture methods _ that is, they couldn't be grown in a petri dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Doggone it, I wonder if it goes into a dormant
state,''' says Colwell.
</P>
<P>
   Her next clue came from Louisiana. In the late 1970s a small
cholera outbreak popped up near New Orleans among a few people who
had eaten crab from a local bayou.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back and took water samples,'' says Colwell. But this
time, rather than attempting to grow a conventional culture,
Colwell tried a new detection method. The test used an antibody
that would latch onto a key component of the bacterium's cell
membrane. Linked to that antibody was a molecule that would light
up under ultraviolet light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a little tribal dance around the microscope,'' she
says, recalling the excitement of her research team. ``You could
see the little devils because they fluoresce bright green. I'll
never forget the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Colwell's detractors dismissed her findings as ``Colwell's
ghosts.'' But later tests confirmed her suspicion that V. cholerae
could exist naturally in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes are the right conditions _ whether in a human gut
or in the environment _ for V. cholerae to come out of dormancy,
multiply and spread its misery. No one knows exactly what
conditions awaken the bacteria from their metabolic slumber.
</P>
<P>
   The critical factor could be anything from the temperature of
the water to the amount of salt. Colwell has already stumbled
across one correlation that she says gave her chills. A graph of
the seasonal peaks in sea-surface temperatures in the Bay of
Bengal, gleaned from satellite data, almost exactly matches a graph
of the seasonal peaks in admissions for cholera in nearby
hospitals. Some four to six weeks after the sea temperature goes
up, so do cholera admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Colwell and HUQ are now trying to determine the exact
relationships between sea temperatures, phytoplankton blooms,
cholera cases and everything in between. If the connections become
clear, says Colwell, the models might be used to create a global
cholera warning system.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Colwell's work could have a local impact. Her
sari-cloth filter, which so impressed the young woman in
Bangladesh, is now being tested by 4,000 families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't remove all the cholera bacteria,'' says Colwell.
``But the numbers go way down. Therefore we expect to be able to
curb the massive epidemics.''

 By ROBERT A. NORMAN  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   My friend Bill Cook, a primary care physician, called me one
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've admitted a patient, a 28-year-old woman,'' he said.
``She's losing her skin. Can you come and take a look at her?''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the patient, Mary Grove, had come to his
office the day before, complaining that her skin had suddenly begun
to peel. She felt strange _ weak and tender _ and her eyes and
mouth felt irritated.
</P>
<P>
   I am a dermatologist, and from Bill's description I had a good
idea of what was wrong with Mary.
</P>
<P>
   I found Mary in her bed, staring at the flickering images on the
TV. When I introduced myself she smiled and said, ``Hey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to take a look at your skin,'' I said, ``if that's
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's left of it,'' she offered.
</P>
<P>
   Her skin was a blanket of red. The top layer was sloughing off
her face, neck, trunk, legs and feet in large sheets like wet
wallpaper. Scattered over her body were a few islands of
normal-looking skin.
</P>
<P>
   I had seen two other patients with this disorder, but neither of
this severity. To determine the extent of the damage, I took a look
at the mucous membranes of her mouth, genitals and eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whaddaya think, Doctor?'' she slurred. Apparently, she was
groggy from her pain medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that you've had a fairly severe reaction to a
medicine you took,'' I said. ``It doesn't happen very often, but
when it does, it can be a real challenge to care for. But we're
going to make sure you get the care you need to recover. Have you
taken any medicines in the last few weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I take something for my knees. It's like a pain pill, but it
never gave me a problem before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else?''
</P>
<P>
   She paused, her eyes focusing somewhere on the ground. ``I did
have an earache, and I took something I found in my cabinet. I'd
have to check it. I remember one of the kids or somebody used it
when they had an infection and it helped, so I took it for a few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember the last time you had a minor burn? Do you
remember how a small part of your skin peeled off? The same
reaction extended all across Mary's body. But Mary's injury hadn't
been caused by anything external, like a burn. The mutiny arose
from within.
</P>
<P>
   I explained to Mary that she was probably suffering an extreme
and unusual allergic reaction to one of the drugs she had taken.
Her immune system, for unknown reasons, viewed it as an enemy and
initiated a defense against it. The reaction _ called toxic
epidermal necrolysis, or TEN _ is poorly understood, but the
devastation of the skin resembles burn injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to watch you very carefully over the next several days
to make sure you don't get an infection or lose too much of your
vital fluids,'' I explained.
</P>
<P>
   I took a sample of skin and sent it to a pathologist. Then I
explained to Mary's nurse the care she would need and called Bill
Cook to put together a treatment plan. We would stabilize her in
the internal medicine unit of our hospital and then closely monitor
her condition.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of her hospitalization, I got back the
pathologist's report, which confirmed my diagnosis. On the third
day of hospitalization, we moved Mary to the burn unit, where the
staff is trained to care for patients with severe skin loss. They
carefully removed the dead skin and applied a loose gauze dressing
saturated with antibacterial agents to the denuded skin surface.
</P>
<P>
   The staff made sure she was getting enough fluids and nutrients
and carefully monitored her fluid intake and urine output. They
also kept a close watch on her general condition and vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was one of about 500 cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis in
the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disorder is considered rare, its frequency may be
underestimated because mild cases probably go unreported. Most
reported cases, like Mary's, pop up one to three weeks after a new
drug is taken. The onset is rapid and in some cases can be terribly
severe. Patients can lose their entire epidermis _ the uppermost of
the skin's three layers _ within about 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest threat to patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis
is not the damage to the skin itself but the manner in which that
damage increases a patient's vulnerability to infection. When the
epidermis is destroyed, the body surface is a standing invitation
to pathogens. Roughly 30 percent of patients diagnosed with TEN die
_ most often because infection has spread into their bloodstreams.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was, in this respect, fortunate. Her internal symptoms were
limited to some inflammation in her mouth. A topical ointment
helped heal and anesthetize the tender inflamed sites.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis for TEN depends on how quickly the disorder is
diagnosed and treated. The peak of the disease (by the third day,
in Mary's case) bears the highest threat, and the fate of the
patient often hangs in the balance for one or more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the surviving patients have residual and
potentially disabling eye lesions, which can include scarring of
the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   Mary's chances for recovery were good, given that we identified
and treated the disorder quickly. After a week in the hospital Mary
improved, and within a month she was up and around.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes appeared to have been spared any chronic harm. She bore
only a slight visible trace of the vast tissue destruction: a small
spot of scar tissue on her left thigh.

<P>
   My friend Bill Cook, a primary care physician, called me one
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've admitted a patient, a 28-year-old woman,'' he said.
``She's losing her skin. Can you come and take a look at her?''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the patient, Mary Grove, had come to his
office the day before, complaining that her skin had suddenly begun
to peel. She felt strange _ weak and tender _ and her eyes and
mouth felt irritated.
</P>
<P>
   I am a dermatologist, and from Bill's description I had a good
idea of what was wrong with Mary.
</P>
<P>
   I found Mary in her bed, staring at the flickering images on the
TV. When I introduced myself she smiled and said, ``Hey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to take a look at your skin,'' I said, ``if that's
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's left of it,'' she offered.
</P>
<P>
   Her skin was a blanket of red. The top layer was sloughing off
her face, neck, trunk, legs and feet in large sheets like wet
wallpaper. Scattered over her body were a few islands of
normal-looking skin.
</P>
<P>
   I had seen two other patients with this disorder, but neither of
this severity. To determine the extent of the damage, I took a look
at the mucous membranes of her mouth, genitals and eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whaddaya think, Doctor?'' she slurred. Apparently, she was
groggy from her pain medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that you've had a fairly severe reaction to a
medicine you took,'' I said. ``It doesn't happen very often, but
when it does, it can be a real challenge to care for. But we're
going to make sure you get the care you need to recover. Have you
taken any medicines in the last few weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I take something for my knees. It's like a pain pill, but it
never gave me a problem before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else?''
</P>
<P>
   She paused, her eyes focusing somewhere on the ground. ``I did
have an earache, and I took something I found in my cabinet. I'd
have to check it. I remember one of the kids or somebody used it
when they had an infection and it helped, so I took it for a few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember the last time you had a minor burn? Do you
remember how a small part of your skin peeled off? The same
reaction extended all across Mary's body. But Mary's injury hadn't
been caused by anything external, like a burn. The mutiny arose
from within.
</P>
<P>
   I explained to Mary that she was probably suffering an extreme
and unusual allergic reaction to one of the drugs she had taken.
Her immune system, for unknown reasons, viewed it as an enemy and
initiated a defense against it. The reaction _ called toxic
epidermal necrolysis, or TEN _ is poorly understood, but the
devastation of the skin resembles burn injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to watch you very carefully over the next several days
to make sure you don't get an infection or lose too much of your
vital fluids,'' I explained.
</P>
<P>
   I took a sample of skin and sent it to a pathologist. Then I
explained to Mary's nurse the care she would need and called Bill
Cook to put together a treatment plan. We would stabilize her in
the internal medicine unit of our hospital and then closely monitor
her condition.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of her hospitalization, I got back the
pathologist's report, which confirmed my diagnosis. On the third
day of hospitalization, we moved Mary to the burn unit, where the
staff is trained to care for patients with severe skin loss. They
carefully removed the dead skin and applied a loose gauze dressing
saturated with antibacterial agents to the denuded skin surface.
</P>
<P>
   The staff made sure she was getting enough fluids and nutrients
and carefully monitored her fluid intake and urine output. They
also kept a close watch on her general condition and vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was one of about 500 cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis in
the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disorder is considered rare, its frequency may be
underestimated because mild cases probably go unreported. Most
reported cases, like Mary's, pop up one to three weeks after a new
drug is taken. The onset is rapid and in some cases can be terribly
severe. Patients can lose their entire epidermis _ the uppermost of
the skin's three layers _ within about 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest threat to patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis
is not the damage to the skin itself but the manner in which that
damage increases a patient's vulnerability to infection. When the
epidermis is destroyed, the body surface is a standing invitation
to pathogens. Roughly 30 percent of patients diagnosed with TEN die
_ most often because infection has spread into their bloodstreams.
</P>
<P>
   Mary was, in this respect, fortunate. Her internal symptoms were
limited to some inflammation in her mouth. A topical ointment
helped heal and anesthetize the tender inflamed sites.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis for TEN depends on how quickly the disorder is
diagnosed and treated. The peak of the disease (by the third day,
in Mary's case) bears the highest threat, and the fate of the
patient often hangs in the balance for one or more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the surviving patients have residual and
potentially disabling eye lesions, which can include scarring of
the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   Mary's chances for recovery were good, given that we identified
and treated the disorder quickly. After a week in the hospital Mary
improved, and within a month she was up and around.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes appeared to have been spared any chronic harm. She bore
only a slight visible trace of the vast tissue destruction: a small
spot of scar tissue on her left thigh.
</P>

COUNTY DEMOCRATIC CHIEF GUILTY IN BANKRUPTCY FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. _ Stephen J. Sabbeth, the chairman of the Nassau
County Democratic Party, was found guilty Wednesday of bankruptcy
fraud, throwing his already splintered party into further disarray
as it immediately began to talk about his departure.
</P>
<P>
   While party members, on hearing word of his conviction, publicly
expressed sympathy for Sabbeth and his family, they said privately
that it was time for him to step down as party chairman even though
the charges against him were not related to the party itself.
</P>
<P>
   The calls for his departure came quickly after a federal jury
convicted Sabbeth of bank fraud as well as perjury and money
laundering in connection with a scheme to conceal $750,000 from his
bank creditors when his lumber business failed a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sabbeth was accused by the government of hiding the money in a
secret brokerage account under his wife's maiden name and under a
fake Social Security number. Although Sabbeth denied all the
charges, the jurors said on leaving U.S. District Court here this
afternoon that the evidence against him ``was overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabbeth repeatedly denied the charges against him, asserting
that he had nothing to hide, that any money he put into the account
was rightfully his and that his broker had filled in the wrong
Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   Sabbeth said the account was opened in his wife's name because
she wanted a separate account. He said that the banks to which he
owed money had been informed about the account and had records of
all the checks deposited to the account.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Denis R. Hurley of Federal District Court said that
Sabbeth, 51, of Old Brookville, could remain free on $50,000 bail.
He faces 70 to 87 months in prison under federal sentencing
guidelines, according to Seth Marvin, the chief prosecutor in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Sabbeth's wife, Carole, 54, is also awaiting sentencing. Mrs.
Sabbeth pleaded guilty in December to two counts of perjury as part
of a plea agreement. She had initially asserted that she alone had
opened the account in her maiden name, Carole Fiore; that her
husband did not know about it, and that she did not know the
stockbroker who handled the account.

 &HT;    Chihuahua governor pushes ban on boozing by U.S. youth
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Chihuahua _ Crossing the Rio Grande to carouse in
Mexico has been a rite of passage for border teen-agers for
generations. The governor of Chihuahua wants to clamp down on
Juarez's party-all-night image by adopting the U.S. drinking age _
but only for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Patricio Martinez, governor of this northern Mexico state, has
proposed keeping the legal minimum drinking age for Mexicans at 18
but raising it to 21 for U.S. residents. Other Mexican states would
not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso, meanwhile, will try to deter underage drinkers by
posting police officers at the four international bridges to look
for intoxicated youths as they return from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The main target of Martinez's proposal is the Juarez club
district, where bars that offer unlimited drinks for an $8 or $9
cover charge draw flocks of high school and college students from
El Paso, Las Cruces and other nearby cities in Texas and New
Mexico. Students say fliers advertising ``drink and drown''
specials in Juarez clubs circulate in El Paso high schools and on
the campus of New Mexico State University in Las Cruces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge problem,'' said Del Chavez, administrator of the
El Paso Mothers Against Drunk Driving chapter. ``If someone's got
the money to buy, they will sell it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's administration wants to target bar owners rather than
the drinkers. Instead of a new state law, the governor's office
wants to use the state's control over liquor licenses to force the
clubs to comply. Businesses that serve alcohol would have to check
patrons' identification, and those who serve to underage Americans
could be slapped with fines or forced to close, said Aurelio Licon,
the governor's representative in Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's office has already used this method to cut back the
hours of the clubs, which until recently stayed open until 5 or 6
a.m. to bring in after-hours crowds from the United States. They
must now close at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Licon said the dual drinking age would be the first of its kind
in Mexico. The governor's office is still studying how to implement
the policy but wants to start it as soon as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although young Americans spend a lot of money in Juarez, Licon
said: ``We don't want that type of spending; we don't want that
kind of tourism. We want family tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   At one popular Juarez club last week, the doorman watched
students from El Paso and New Mexico filter in on a slow Thursday
night. He said the new governor _ who reclaimed the governorship
for the ruling party last fall and immediately announced a
crackdown on various social ills _ is just pulling a publicity
stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't enforce it,'' said the man, who refused to give his
name because he feared the government would retaliate against his
club. ``Only the congress can change the law. It's a lot of noise
on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Dangers
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, New Mexico State student Philip Muller, who had made the
45-minute drive from Las Cruces to Juarez with about 40 fraternity
brothers, most of them underage, said he first came to the Juarez
bars when he was 14. No one asked his age, he said, ``and I've been
coming ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Muller, now 21, said that when he was an El Paso high school
student, Juarez bar owners would pay students $1 for every 20
friends they brought in. He said he and his friends passed out
homemade fliers in the school halls. He said he still sees similar
fliers on his college campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father used to do this when he was 16,'' he said. ``I guess
that's why we come here, so we can all have a good time and not get
arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting arrested isn't the only danger. Roger Maier,
spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service in El Paso, said Customs
agents who work the bridges sometimes have to assist people who
need medical attention after getting beaten up or stabbed _ usually
during alcohol-fed altercations.
</P>
<P>
   That worries El Paso Mayor Carlos Ramirez, who supports the
Chihuahua governor's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a problem with the idea that some bar and club owners
across the river consider getting our young people drunk economic
development,'' Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez said he and Martinez discussed their common problem in
Austin six weeks ago when they met during Gov. George W. Bush's
inaugural celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican governor was tired of the fighting, drunken driving
and general disorder that spilled from the clubs. The El Paso mayor
was worried about the safety of his city's young people and other
residents who might cross paths with an inebriated young driver.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he was pleasantly surprised at Martinez's bold
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bar owners and the disco owners are not going to like it,
and I applaud his stance,'' Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, who became El Paso's mayor in June, said the city will
send police officers, and perhaps some volunteers, to the four
international bridges next week as spring break begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be looking for kids who are obviously underage
and very drunk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are under 21 and come over the bridge intoxicated will
have their parents called to pick them up and may face a fine,
Ramirez said.

 &HT;    SAS chief guiding company to become a solutions vendor
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARY, N.C. _ Jim Goodnight, SAS Institute Inc.'s president, is
rich but not flashy.
</P>
<P>
   His fortune is estimated at $3 billion, ranking him as the
wealthiest North Carolinian. But he drives a 1996 Buick Roadmaster,
spacious enough for his lanky 6-foot-5-inch frame. Hanging from his
key chain is one of those electronic-sensoring tags that rings up
discounted groceries at Harris Teeter.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a computer programmer at North Carolina State
University, the son of a Wilmington, N.C., hardware store owner
co-founded SAS in 1976. Intensely private and publicity-shy to the
point of seeming disinterested, even bored, Goodnight, 56, recently
lifted the veil surrounding himself and the nation's largest
privately held software manufacturer, based in Cary, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with staff writer Chris Burritt, Goodnight talks
about SAS' future, the Microsoft challenge, his purchase of Midway
Airlines and making money.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have been described as a visionary. What will SAS'
business look like in the year 2005?
</P>
<P>
   A: Our goal over the next few years is to turn into more of a
solutions vendor, one that solves business problems that our
customers have. We have for so many years been more of a toolmaker,
making tools that customers can use to put solutions together
themselves to solve problems. That aspect of SAS will always be
there, but we are moving more now into what I like to call the
knowledge ware, not just the software but the knowledge that goes
with it, to help install product, get it up and running to help
solve problems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You talk as though you are becoming a consultant to business,
more than a software maker.
</P>
<P>
   A: We will still make software, but it will be more specifically
tailored to specific solutions and requirements of our users. By
2005, Microsoft will have probably put all other software
manufacturers out of business. That is their main objective, their
main goal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Including you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Certainly they have targeted us. They are going after our
multidimensional database business. They have changed their
product, and, guess what, they are giving it away free as part of
their SQL Server (a database product). It is a typical tactic ...
something that other people are charging for, give it away for
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the U.S. Justice Department's lawsuit against Microsoft,
what side do you come down on?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would have to come down on Justice's. They are now giving
away a product that we are charging for. ... They have done this
over the years. ... The list is a mile long of these kinds of
activities that Microsoft has done. They have used their enormous
revenues that they've gained from their operating systems, have put
out of business spreadsheet makers and word processing people, now
they are moving up the food chain to the (Web) browser area.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where are you on the food chain, how high up?
</P>
<P>
   A: We are reasonably high up, but we are climbing fast
(laughing) trying to get out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On another topic, did you ever consider going public to raise
funds for SAS' expansion?
</P>
<P>
   A: We would not go public to raise funds. We have funds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why have you remained a privately held company?
</P>
<P>
   A: The head of one of the biggest banking concerns in New York
said to me at dinner one night, ``Jim, if you don't need the money,
don't go public.'' I agreed with him. It is an enormous pain. There
are quarterly demands about whether or not you make profits each
quarter, or whether it was more than it was in the quarter a year
ago. I don't care about stuff like that. Our focus is on a year
out, two years out, trying to deliver solutions for our customers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When Midway Airlines was faltering at Raleigh-Durham
International Airport, you bought control of it in 1997. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: John Sall (another of SAS' founders) and I bought controlling
interest in it. It was on the block, and we were looking at the
potential of losing that airline to another group who planned to
take the planes and move them somewhere else. We felt like we
needed it as part of our business and for the Triangle area. Before
Midway, this was an American hub, and we certainly got used to the
convenience of not having to fly through Atlanta any time we went
out of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is it that the software business is so profitable for
companies such as yours?
</P>
<P>
   A: When you finish your research and development, you stamp it
out. It's not as though you have to build an assembly plant. The
biggest expense is people.

 &HT;    Software firm's perks help cut employee stress
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARY, N.C. _ The fitness staff at SAS Institute Inc., the big
software maker, was torn over hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Should they buy more exercise bikes or rowing machines?
</P>
<P>
   They opted for a half-dozen rowing machines, concluding that
SAS' computer programmers who spend hours at keyboards would
benefit from the backward motion of rowing. By contrast, leaning
over the handlebars of a bike replicates hunching over a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Such seemingly small decisions are a big deal at SAS, where many
of the 2,700 employees in Cary, N.C., work as programmers of
statistical software. With sales this year forecast to reach $1
billion, the nation's largest privately held software producer
sells to thousands of businesses, universities and government
agencies worldwide _ including Atlanta giants Coca-Cola, Delta Air
Lines, BellSouth, Home Depot and Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   In a setting of such rapid growth and highly technical work, SAS
seems a natural breeding ground for the type of mind-numbing,
productivity-sapping stress that infects much of corporate America.
But SAS officials have discovered that many of the perks the
company uses to recruit and retain hard-to-find programmers have
proved helpful in reducing employee stress.
</P>
<P>
   People are clamoring to work at SAS. It has more than 21,000 job
applications on file. Yearly turnover hovers around 4 percent,
compared with a software industry average of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, publications including Working Mother, Fortune,
Business Week and Mother Jones have ranked the company as one of
the nation's best places to work.
</P>
<P>
   SAS is building an indoor swimming pool on its bucolic corporate
campus, adding yet another fitness option that includes yoga,
massage, aerobics, basketball, weight training, golf and tennis
lessons, and Tai Chi, a form of martial arts designed to reduce
stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give people the chance to pop off the top of the
steam kettle,'' said David Russo, SAS' vice president of human
resources. ``This type of work is intellectually intense. It causes
a fatigue that is hard to rest up from.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, workplace stress is linked to computers. An
estimated 20 million Americans work in occupations where computers
are a primary tool. More than 40 percent of households have
computers.
</P>
<P>
   As computer usage has soared, so has the incidence of repetitive
stress injury, a broad category of ailments of the back, neck,
arms, wrists and hands. SAS isn't immune to such problems.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, an estimated 20 employees visit the company's
4-year-old ergonomics lab, equipped with an assortment of
odd-looking chairs, keyboards and mice intended to prevent
stress-related injuries. Stress also contributes to a host of
emotional problems, including depression, anxiety and anger.
</P>
<P>
   SAS offers at least a partial cure for this worsening ill of
corporate America. The company's broad array of amenities seeks to
relieve stress related not only to computers but also to everyday
life.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, SAS has been so inwardly focused for so many years that
it has something of a mysterious image. That's especially true
among people who have never ventured past the gatehouse entrance
onto the company's campus, tucked on 200 wooded acres on I-40
between Raleigh and Research Triangle Park.
</P>
<P>
   A ``23 mph'' sign just inside the entrance suggests that things
here are a bit different. The campus is dotted by futuristic
sculptures, which seem to pop up overnight at the whim of SAS
President Jim Goodnight and his wife, Ann.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to reality are SAS managers such as Stuart and Suzy
Nisbet. Both are 34, a year older than the average age of company
employees. One of their biggest challenges is balancing work and
home, and SAS helps them do that.
</P>
<P>
   The company's flexible, 35-hour workweek allows the Nisbets to
trade off duties, such as getting their two daughters ready for
school.
</P>
<P>
   Starting as infants, both attended SAS' on-campus Montessori
school, reasonably priced at $250 a month per child.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole, 6, now attends elementary school. But her sister,
3-year-old Rachel, frequently eats with her parents in the
company-subsidized cafeteria, the Pennies Cafe, where pianist
Brenda Bruce taps out the themes from ``The Phantom of the Opera''
and ``Barney'' on a baby grand.
</P>
<P>
   The Nisbets exercise at the fitness center several days a week.
If they or their children are sick, they visit the on-campus family
practice medical clinic, which is free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loyalty that people build up over things like that goes
beyond words,'' said Stuart Nisbet, a graphics software manager.
</P>
<P>
   Nisbet lives with his wife and daughters in Prestonwood and
belongs to the Cary subdivision's 54-hole private golf club. Both
are owned by Goodnight, who gives discounts to SAS employees who
buy homes in the subdivision and join the club. Cary Academy, a
private high school started by Goodnight and his wife, Ann,
provides tuition breaks to the children of SAS employees.
</P>
<P>
   Once or twice a month, Nisbet receives phone calls from rival
software companies, offering him jobs in Silicon Valley paying as
much as 40 percent more than he makes at SAS. So far, he has
resisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of quality of life and lifestyle,'' Nisbet said,
``there is nothing I've seen that compares with what we have
here.''
</P>
<P>
   SAS has evolved into a sort of stress-busting laboratory in the
nearly two decades since co-founders Goodnight and John Sall
attached an indoor racquetball court to their first building.
</P>
<P>
   At North Carolina State University in nearby Raleigh, Goodnight
earned a doctorate in statistics, and he fell in love with
programming. That spurred him and three partners to develop the
software that led in 1976 to the creation of SAS, which stands for
Statistical Analysis System.
</P>
<P>
   A primary job of SAS' software is referred to as ``data
warehousing and data mining.'' It sorts huge volumes of information
_ from grocery purchases to U.S. Census data to credit card
transactions _ and organizes it in ways that customers, such as
Coca-Cola or Home Depot, can interpret to drum up new business or
forecast sales.
</P>
<P>
   As the company has grown, Goodnight has insisted that some of
the oldest perks remain. Break rooms contain free soft drinks,
juices, coffee and tea. They're stocked with fresh fruit on Monday,
M&AMP;Ms on Wednesday, and doughnuts and pastries on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Goodnight employs an artist in residence, Holly Brewster Jones,
whose abstract watercolors are scattered among SAS' 20 buildings.
Inside several of the buildings are fountains and atriums decorated
by trees and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing the architectural footprint for SAS' newest office
buildings, Goodnight insisted on putting patios between every two
floors. They're intended as meeting places for staff, reminding him
of the friendliness among employees when SAS consisted only of
Building A, a two-story rectangle of brown bricks and dark glass.
</P>
<P>
   Employees consume 22 tons of M&AMP;Ms (peanut and plain) a year,
hinting at the scope of SAS' package of amenities. Human resources
chief Russo said the company gladly invests in perks because it
contributes to a stable, well-trained work force.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, if turnover were a problem, SAS would spend big
sums on training, Russo said. The cost per employee could reach 2
1/2 times SAS' average salary of $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Goodnight dismisses the suggestion that SAS avoids paying top
wages under the guise of tax benefits to employees. ``We don't pay
less,'' he said. ``We are in the middle of Research Triangle
salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   He is just now considering a plan to provide SAS workers with
stock options, a highly lucrative perk for employees of many
publicly traded technology companies. Granting options would allow
SAS to sell shares to the public but not enough to strip Goodnight
of control.
</P>
<P>
   For 22 consecutive years, the company has contributed to a
profit-sharing plan for employees and doled out discretionary
bonuses. In some cases, that year-end perk pads employees' pay by
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think long and hard before they go somewhere else,''
Goodnight said.

<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Just when you think every aspect of the Y2K
problem has been addressed, up comes a new issue. This report was
sent to me allegedly from one of Texas' premier universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our staff has completed the 18 months of work on time and on
budget. We have gone through every line of code in every program in
every system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have analyzed all databases, all data files, including
backups and historic archives, and modified all data to reflect the
Change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proud to report that we have completed the ``Y-to-K''
date change mission, and have now implemented all changes to all
programs and all data to reflect your new standards: Januark,
Februark, March, April, Mak, June, Julk, August, September,
October, November, December. As well as: Sundak, Mondak, Tuesdak,
Wednesdak, Thursdak, Fridak, and Saturdak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trust that this is satisfactory, because to be honest, none
of this Y to K change has made any sense to us. But we understand
it is a global problem, and our team is glad to help in any way
possible. And what does the year 2000 have to do with it?

<P>
   ``Speaking of which, what do you think we ought to do next year
when the two-digit year rolls over from '99 to '00?''

 &HT;    Critics want to force Bush to define his terms
 &HT;    By Don McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Monday morning, teachers rallied in front of the
Capitol to protest teacher pay in Texas, which ranks 38th among the
states.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, Interfaith organizations from throughout the
state baked in the sun on the Capitol steps, trying to persuade top
state officials to spend more money on schools that serve students
from poor families.
</P>
<P>
   Other organizations are urging legislators _ and Gov. George W.
Bush _ to take action to qualify more than 1 million uninsured
Texas kids for federally subsidized health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, Democrats in the Texas Senate asked for a rare
interruption of the Senate's proceedings for a brief Democratic
Caucus meeting. The result: a slight delay in approving Gov. Bush's
three most recent nominees for University of Texas board of
regents. But Senate business was held up just long enough to make a
point.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Royce West (D-Dallas), an African-American, noted in a
floor speech that the governor failed to nominate an
AfricanAmerican to fill any of the board positions. That is despite
the fact that Texas is rapidly reaching the point where a majority
of its citizens are members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   While all the senators except West voted for the governor's
nominees, some of their speeches aimed to put Bush on notice that
words alone are not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Taken collectively, the groups in front of the Capitol and the
Democratic legislators are putting a spotlight on Gov. Bush's claim
to be a ``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people inside and outside Texas expect Bush's continuing
exploration of the presidency to end in a decision to run. And that
makes his attitudes on Texas issues, such as how much to spend for
schools, teachers and health insurance for kids, a matter for
national attention.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has made reaching out to Hispanics and
African-Americans a major part of his political journey and
education his No. 1 priority, West questioned why Bush can't make
room for one African-American among the nine members charting UT's
course.
</P>
<P>
   The 140-day biennial session, already a third over, will be a
laboratory for measuring the governor's attitudes on some critical
areas, measuring his compassion against his conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Running for president in 1992, Bill Clinton took on some
powerful groups within the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton advocated free trade before the United Auto Workers
union. Before the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, Clinton criticized what he said were racist remarks
by an African-American rap singer.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Begala, a Texan who just left as a top adviser to President
Clinton, says he's watching to see if Bush will take on some of the
more conservative elements in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge to the 'compassionate conservative' will be to
put some meaning behind the label,'' Begala said.
</P>
<P>
   At his meeting with Texas reporters Tuesday, Bush tried to do
that: ``It's conservative to cut taxes,'' Bush said, while it's
compassionate ``to make sure that every child (who needs it) gets
extra help.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, his spokeswoman, called Bush a conservative who
wears a smile rather than a frown, who says what he's for rather
than what he's against.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has advocated shifting more of the burden for paying for
public schools from local school districts to the state. He has
called for more attention to teaching children to read. He wants to
stop social promotions when students' work is not up to par.
</P>
<P>
   But how much Bush is willing to advocate spending, or allow to
be spent, on those and other programs will increasingly receive
attention not just from teacher organizations and other groups, but
from national news reporters and political pundits. And from other
presidential candidates and voters.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's short-term effort is to prove to Republican primary
voters he's conservative enough to justify the GOP nomination, the
depth of his compassion may decide how many additional votes he can
attract in the general election from Democrats and independents, as
well as from moderate and liberal Republicans.

played a People reporter), but, in fact, has expertly gauged what
we want to read about. With 33 million readers and spinoffs such as

power at the movie box office. It's quickly turning anyone over 21
into human Betamaxes: Movies simply don't fit them anymore. Like so
many successful movie genres, the teen flicks all may seem somewhat
familiar. They also might seem somewhat foreign to anyone over 21.
So, herewith a simple guide to the movies taking over your

   PEOPLE-BIRTHDAY _ People, the ``mother of all human interest
magazines,'' turns 25 years old Friday (March 5). It's the magazine
that most shrewdly anticipated and capitalized on our national
obsession with celebrity. People was a punchline in ``The Big
Chill,'' when it served as an emblem for empty fluff (''It's just
good investigative journalism'' deadpanned Jeff Goldblum, who
played a People reporter), but, in fact, has expertly gauged what
we want to read about. With 33 million readers and spinoffs such as
InStyle and Teen People going strong, and ongoing expansion into
television and cyberspace, the franchise looks durable. A look at
the People phenomenon. (Emerson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   MOVIES-TEENS _ Remember when the scariest thing about '90s
teenagers was the music they listened to and the body parts they
pierced? Suddenly, Marilyn Manson and nipple rings seem downright
quaint. What we really have to fear now is teens' all-consuming
power at the movie box office. It's quickly turning anyone over 21
into human Betamaxes: Movies simply don't fit them anymore. Like so
many successful movie genres, the teen flicks all may seem somewhat
familiar. They also might seem somewhat foreign to anyone over 21.
So, herewith a simple guide to the movies taking over your
multiplex. (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH COLOR

   MOVIES-LOCK _ People are calling ``Lock, Stock &AMP; 2 Smoking
Barrels'' a British version of Quentin Tarantino. But
writer-director Guy Ritchie and two of his stars - Jason Flemyng
and Jason Statham - are too busy touring the States to worry about
labels. They're also learning big, unwieldy words out of
dictionaries. And they're insisting that, despite prevailing
gossip, Madonna is not Guy's new girlfriend. (StMurray, Atlanta

<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Just when you think every aspect of the Y2K
problem has been addressed, up comes a new issue. This report was
sent to me allegedly from one of Texas' premier universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our staff has completed the 18 months of work on time and on
budget. We have gone through every line of code in every program in
every system.
</P>

   ``We have analyzed all databases, all data files, including
backups and historic archives, and modified all data to reflect the
Change.

<P>
   ``We are proud to report that we have completed the ``Y-to-K''
date change mission, and have now implemented all changes to all

October, November, December. As well as: Sundak, Mondak, Tuesdak,
Wednesdak, Thursdak, Fridak, and Saturdak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trust that this is satisfactory, because to be honest, none
of this Y to K change has made any sense to us. But we understand
it is a global problem, and our team is glad to help in any way
possible. And what does the year 2000 have to do with it?

<P>
   ``Speaking of which, what do you think we ought to do next year
when the two-digit year rolls over from '99 to '00?''

DETERMINATION WINS IN `ROCK THE BOAT`
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 STARS 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sailing a boat across the Pacific Ocean as part of
the grueling Trans-Pacific Yacht Race is a difficult task even
under the best of circumstances. Add to that conditions that are
the fastest, windiest and darkest in 20 years and you've got a real
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of Survivor faced all that and more. Mostly amateurs,
each member has tested HIV-positive and some have been diagnosed
with full-blown AIDS. The nine men were assembled by Get
Challenged, an AIDS empowerment group, to man the boat and show the
world that the disease does not end life or diminish its
possibilities. To that end, both with the race and with this
documentary, they have succeded rather heroically.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Rock the Boat,'' filmmaker (and crew member) Bobby Houston
has vividly captured the struggles these men faced during the
10-day, 2,250-mile race. For starters, there was the simple matter
of staying alive and in one piece. It's not unusual for boats to
lose their masts and rigging during this grueling race, nor is it
uncommon for crew members to be bruised or battered while trying to
prevent this from happening.
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows the 1997 project from the beginning with
Robert Hudson, the executive director of Get Challenged. Hudson's
job is to challenge people who are HIV-positive to actively engage
life, believing that half the battle is to smile, laugh and get a
little exercise. Entering the Trans-Pacific Yacht Race would seem
to be a tall order (particularly with an amateur crew), but it's
just the kind of symbolic effort that would show the world _ and
others diagnosed HIV-positive _ that AIDS doesn't mean the end of
life.
</P>
<P>
   The HIV-negative Houston has spectacularly shot the boat's
journey, particularly considering the limitations imposed by the
tight confines, rough waters and lighting restrictions. Houston
also worked on the crew, pulling four shifts a day in addition to
filming. This enabled him to be accepted by one and all, with the
possible exception of the boat's ultra-competitive captain, John,
who doesn't always appreciate having a camera in his face.
</P>
<P>
   John is but one of several interesting men vividly captured by
Houston. Ted, the ship's peacemaking cook, is a former Christian
missionary. First mate Mike, an ex-Marine, has 14 T-cells (the
normal amount for the immune system is 1,000) but still runs
marathons and hyperactively flies around the Survivor's deck
wherever he's needed. Steve Kovacev is similarly low on T-cells,
but long on spirit. He just completed his second Boston Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 10-day race, these guys fight the odds, their own
doubts and occasionally each other while trying to accomplish
something pretty special. Every member of the crew has been told he
is going to die; yet here they are still living, still learning,
still finding reasons to feel hopeful. It's a message ``Rock the
Boat'' doesn't wave in your face, but it doesn't have to. You can
see it in these men who carry death sentences but (at least here)
are engaging life with expressions of hope.

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ At least Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan
Phillippe, the stars of ``Cruel Intentions,'' don't act like the
kids in all the season's other teen movies. They don't act like
kids who ever lived on planet Earth, either, but that somehow seems
appropriate for this bizarre, adolescent fantasy update of the
18th-century French novel ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Gellar and Phillippe, together again after the rather less
rarefied ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' are the brilliant,
decadent, sexually superpowerful Kathryn Merteuil and Sebastian
Valmont, roles played by the much more mature likes of Glenn Close,
John Malkovich and Annette Bening in ``Dangerous Liaisons'' and
``Valmont'' 10 or more years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of bewigged Gallic aristocrats, this time around
they're filthy rich New York brats, a stepbrother and -sister whose
negligent parents are never on a continent near enough to provide
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   So these two bratty arguments for eating the wealthy spend their
time plotting to ruin the daughters of Manhattan's rich and obtuse.
Sebastian can apparently seduce any female on two legs, despite the
fact that he has all the personal magnetism of an effete lemur.

is a funny shot of Phillippe's backside, the only sex is a discreet
and loving scene between him and Witherspoon (who are engaged in
real life, no less), and Cecile's erotic awakenings are played
purely _ and expertly _ for laughs.

are, however, certifiably shocking. After hearing just how Kathryn

resonance.

   That, like everything else about ``Cruel Intentions,'' is in no
way good for children and other living things. But they'll probably
like it anyway. &UR;

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ At least Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan
Phillippe, the stars of ``Cruel Intentions,'' don't act like the
kids in all the season's other teen movies. They don't act like
kids who ever lived on planet Earth, either, but that somehow seems
appropriate for this bizarre, adolescent fantasy update of the
18th-century French novel ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Gellar and Phillippe, together again after the rather less
rarefied ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' are the brilliant,
decadent, sexually superpowerful Kathryn Merteuil and Sebastian
Valmont, roles played by the much more mature likes of Glenn Close,
John Malkovich and Annette Bening in ``Dangerous Liaisons'' and
``Valmont'' 10 or more years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of bewigged Gallic aristocrats, this time around
they're filthy rich New York brats, a stepbrother and -sister whose
negligent parents are never on a continent near enough to provide
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   So these two bratty arguments for eating the wealthy spend their
time plotting to ruin the daughters of Manhattan's rich and obtuse.
Sebastian can apparently seduce any female on two legs, despite the
fact that he has all the personal magnetism of an effete lemur.

<P>
   A: The film is 1977's ``The Car,'' which also stars Ronny Cox
and Melody Thomas Scott.
</P>
<P>
   The film doesn't appear to be available on video, but it still
airs occasionally on TV. The Sci-Fi Channel aired it in late
January.
</P>
<P>
   The movie should be easier to find if a planned sequel is
filmed. The Internet movie site Coming Attractions reported last
year that writers Brad Heiner and Robert Masciantonio are working
on a script for ``The Car 2.''
</P>
<P>
   The story reportedly brings back the demonic 1971 Lincoln Mark
III, and Brolin has been approached to star in it. You can find
Coming Attractions on the World Wide Web at corona.bc.ca//films.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A: Greeting cards of all kinds can be sent to St. Jude's Ranch
for Children (in Nevada), where they are converted into new cards
for Christmas and other holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch, a nonprofit home for troubled and abused children,
started the project about 25 years ago to teach residents about
earning money. Profits are used for field trips and savings
accounts for the residents.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 residents at the ranch produced 300,000 cards last year.
Send packages to 100 St. Jude's St., Boulder City, NV 89005, and
first-class mail to Box 60100, Boulder City, NV 89006.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-card packet of cards can be ordered for $6.50 from the
second address or by calling (800) 492-3562.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I contact the woman who makes fruitcakes in the shape
of Texas? She was on ``Texas Country Reporter,'' but I missed
almost all of the story.
</P>
<P>
   _ R.J., Azle, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Those fruitcakes are made by Gladys' Cookie Shop in Flatonia.
For ordering information, call (800) 580-9596, or write to 11624 N.

DE NIRO CAST AS GOODFELLA AND A FUNNYFELLA, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 STARS 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Robert De Niro doesn't get to make us laugh very
often. Usually, his characters are too busy with the rough stuff to
have time to crack wise; although sometimes, De Niro manages the
neat trick of doing both, albeit in a dark, twisted way. (See
``Goodfellas.'')
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of practice, De Niro can be very funny, given
the right material. His portrayal of a cagey political operative in
``Wag the Dog'' is a good recent example. My favorite was his turn
as the tough, foul-mouthed bounty hunter tracking Charles Grodin in
the 1988 buddy film, ``Midnight Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``Analyze This,'' an entertaining movie that allows De
Niro to gently spoof every gangster he has ever played while
displaying an expert sense of comic timing. It's a wonderful
performance and reason enough to see this movie, which starts out
strong and then tapers off, but still has enough laughs to leave
you satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro plays Paul Vitti, a New York mobster suffering from
anxiety attacks. He needs an ear to bend and _
 &UR; !ital! &LR; shhhh! &UR; !off! &LR;  _ a shoulder to cry on. But he's not a man
accustomed to asking for help, let alone getting in touch with his
inner self. It would be a sign of weakness, and signals like that
usually carry a death sentence in Vitti's world.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal), a psychiatrist who accidentally
bumps into Vitti's head henchman and winds up becoming his
appointed shrink. Of course, at first Vitti is loath to admit that
he's one of those asking for help. It's for a ``friend.'' Soon,
though, Vitti is unburdening himself. He does have a caveat about
all this touchy-feely stuff, however. He tells Sobel, ``I feel
`fag,' you die.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Vitti isn't the easiest patient in the world,
and director Harold Ramis (who wrote the screenplay with Peter
Tolan and Kenneth Lonergan) gets a lot of mileage from the clash
between his emotional outbursts and Sobel's cerebral, psychobabble
approach. De Niro's expressions upon hearing Oedipus and Freud
explained are alone worth the price of admission. There's also an
inspired ``Godfather'' dream sequence that casts De Niro as Fredo,
not Vito Corleone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was Fredo?'' De Niro asks incredulously. ``I don't think
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Crystal plays straight man to De Niro's tortured hoodlum for
most of the movie. His biggest scenes come toward the end, but by
that time the movie has run out of gas, having thoroughly depleted
the drama of the pair's personality conflict. Ramis and crew have
written enough good jokes, but the story is paper thin, and when
the movie tries for poignancy, it doesn't ring true.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Analyze This'' is a comedy and, for the most part, it
works. You laugh _ a lot. No deeper analysis is needed. &UR;

`LOCK, STOCK' LOADED WITH LAUGHS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 4 STARS 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' introduces
us to some 30-odd lowlife characters in its first 20 or so minutes.
All of them speak with thick working-class accents and _ while
hardly the most educated types in Britain _ possess rich, inventive
slang vocabularies. Many of these mostly young men favor
close-cropped haircuts and menacing leers, and are played by actors
even dedicated U.S. art house fans won't recognize.
</P>
<P>
   What, you begin to think, is an American expected to make of
this impenetrably English tough guy farce? But just when you're
about to despair of ever understanding what's going on or being
said, the characters and their affiliations start to crystallize
and their bumptious cockney jive talk goes from ``sounds funny'' to
just plain funny.
</P>
<P>
   And then the movie really gets wild.
</P>
<P>
   The first feature from English commercial-maker Guy Ritchie,
``Lock, Stock'' is a smart comedy about criminal boneheadedness.
Its elaborate plot was clearly inspired by the likes of ``The Usual
Suspects'' and ``Pulp Fiction,'' as was its impudent verbal
dexterity. But Ritchie's creativity was truly stoked by those
much-copied films; ``Lock, Stock'' is a distinctive vision, not a
rip-off.
</P>
<P>
   A helpful voice on the soundtrack introduces some of the
characters; others just appear going about their (almost
exclusively illegal) business, and part of the fun is trying to
figure out just how they're all going to mess each other up.
</P>
<P>
   Our main lads are four boyhood pals from London's grimy East
End. Eddie (Nick Moran) doesn't do much but fancies himself a card
shark. He gets his mates _ Tom (Jason Flemyng), who runs a crooked
pawn shop; Bacon (Jason Statham), who sells stolen goods on the
street; and Soap (Dexter Fletcher), who cooks for a restaurant _ to
stake him to a game run by the local crime boss, an old reprobate
named Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarty). The game is fixed, Nick loses
500,000 pounds the boys don't have, and Harry gives them a week to
get the money before he starts collecting their fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's also obsessed with two antique shotguns _ the double
barrels of the title _ that a pair of bumbling burglars from up
north stole for him but resold to a fence. As things get absurdly
complicated, the guns, which change hands with running-gag
regularity, become symbolic of how every crook in the movie is so
idiotically focused on his own limited agenda he can't see the
wider picture of what's really going on.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the smartest of Oxford dons might have difficulty
doing that. Besides Eddie's boys, there are at least four
better-organized gangs, not to mention the northern thieves and
Harry's henchmen, who include a delightfully intimidating giant of
a man (the late Lenny McLean, a bare-knuckle boxing star who
actually once worked as an enforcer for the notorious Kray
brothers' mob) and Big Chris (soccer bad boy Vinnie Jones), who
chastises blokes he's torturing if they curse in front of Little
Chris (Peter McNicholl), the young son he dotes on and brings to
all of his assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Got all that? Well, there's more. Way more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock, Stock'' flirts with that very English notion of being
too clever by half, yet at a certain point an oddly satisfying,
dark comic inevitability sets in. With the exception of a few
clever surprises, you become aware of how the whole thing's going
to play out just as it's preparing to. But instead of getting that
old, disappointed feeling predictable movies give us, this one
operates more like an enjoyable reward well-earned, seeing as how
we had to pay so much close attention leading up to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock, Stock'' does not boast anything like ``Usual Suspects'''
narrative intricacy or ``Pulp's'' thematic depth. It is superficial
by comparison, but delightfully so _ and, though violent, nowhere
near as shockingly brutal as most crime movies of the '90s are.
It's just a great comedy of dumb macho misbehavior, convincingly
detailed and hilariously heightened in all the right places. &QL;

   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ At least Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan
Phillippe, the stars of ``Cruel Intentions,'' don't act like the

kids who ever lived on planet Earth, either, but that somehow seems

18th-century French novel ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Gellar and Phillippe, together again after the rather less

Valmont, roles played by the much more mature likes of Glenn Close,

   So these two bratty arguments for eating the wealthy spend their
time plotting to ruin the daughters of Manhattan's rich and obtuse.
Sebastian can apparently seduce any female on two legs, despite the
fact that he has all the personal magnetism of an effete lemur.
Once he compromises a young lady, the calculating Kathryn _ Gellar
plays her like a highly sophisticated android programmed purely for
wickedness _ secretly ensures that the girl's reputation is
shattered in the most embarrassing of manners.
</P>
<P>
   Ludicrous as this stuff sounds in 1999, adapter-director Roger
Kumble has shrewdly placed the action in one of the few settings
where it could conceivably still matter: the world of
Eastern-establishment debutantes. He also gets rich satiric fun out
of one particularly twitty family _ a dumb trust-fund bunny named
Cecile (played in a marvelous state of emotional slapstick by Selma
Blair) and her pretentious mother named, um, Bunny (Christine
Baranski, to the manner born).
</P>
<P>
   Cecile is so charged-up by her supposed degradation at Sebastian
and Kathryn's hands, she subversively, if cluelessly, exposes their
machinations for the ridiculous nonsense that they are. Somewhat
disappointingly, though, this otherwise smart, wicked movie takes
one of those schemes much too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   If you're familiar with any ``Liaisons'' incarnation, you know
the main plot springs from a wager Kathryn makes with Sebastian. If
he can conquer an egregiously virtuous virgin _ in this case,
school headmaster's daughter Annette Hargrove (Reese Witherspoon),
who's written one of those ``Why I'm saving myself for true love''
essays in Seventeen magazine _ she'll reward her stepsibling with
the one woman he could not have: herself.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't accomplish his task, Sebastian forfeits the keys
to his '56 Jaguar convertible. Of course, an even worse fate awaits
the fancy lad: He truly falls in love with the genuinely good
Annette.
</P>
<P>
   Bad melodrama ensues, but despite the arch, starched tone that
dominates the film, some real emotional impact builds up within
this strange triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Parents _ and their adolescents whom the film is clearly
targeting _ will want to know just how dirty this thing gets. The
answer is: just a tad, in every way but verbally. The only nudity
is a funny shot of Phillippe's backside, the only sex is a discreet
and loving scene between him and Witherspoon (who are engaged in
real life, no less), and Cecile's erotic awakenings are played
purely _ and expertly _ for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the things that come out of the mouths of these babes
are, however, certifiably shocking. After hearing just how Kathryn
proposes her wager to Sebastian here, whenever Gellar stakes out a
vampire as TV's ``Buffy,'' it will have a whole, prurient new
resonance.
</P>
<P>
   That, like everything else about ``Cruel Intentions,'' is in no
way good for children and other living things. But they'll probably
like it anyway. &UR;

MAKING A SCORE IN VIDEO GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine you're on a plane to Seattle, all dressed up in shiny
new shoes and headed for your first real job. The guy next to you
begins the clever in-flight banter. ``So, what do you do?'' You
explain that you compose music for video games, and Mr. Chatty lets
out a laugh so loud that the tray tables rattle. Your new shoes
suddenly seem scruffy; your ego is deflated.
</P>
<P>
   That happened five years ago to Jeremy Soule, who was all of 19
at the time. ``The guy said, `Oh, you make all those little noises,
all those beeps and boops?' It was so depressing,'' the composer
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last five years, the music for interactive games has
gone from simple beeps and boops to large-scale symphonic
orchestration. Soule is one of about a dozen artists in the
vanguard of this burgeoning field. His score for Total
Annihilation, a popular strategy game released in 1997, was
recorded by Northwest Sinfonia, a 95-piece orchestra made up of
musicians from the Seattle Symphony, Seattle Opera, and Northwest
Ballet. The music sounds like the soundtrack for a popcorn flick _
lush and emotional, full of peaks and valleys. It's no wonder that
John Williams is Soule's favorite composer.
</P>
<P>
   Total Annihilation was one of the first games to feature a
symphonic score, but it's becoming de rigeur in the gaming
industry. Games like Myst and Riven have separate soundtrack CDs.
If you're anything like me (with gaming skills that begin and end
as a Trivial Pursuit), you can skip the bombs going off in the game
and just listen to the music.
</P>
<P>
   Soule, 24, is the in-house composer for Cavedog Entertainment in
Seattle, where he's working on the score for Cavedog's upcoming
adventure epic, Amen: The Awakening. He sounds like a cross between
the artist in the garret and the kid glued to the video screen when
he describes his work. ``Our hero narrowly escapes an atomic blast
by going into a manhole and flipping down into the subway tunnels
beneath New York,'' Soule explains. ``There's moss and decay
everywhere. I created a score with a lot of low strings, a very
soft mallet on a gong and muted percussion. It sounds like you're
in a tiny room, with a serious feeling of claustrophobia.''
</P>
<P>
   Soule didn't exactly imagine that he'd be composing scores for
computer games. He says he started composing melodies when he was 3
and that he could notate music before he could write his name: ``My
mother can prove it,'' he says. His father is a music teacher (``I
call him Mr. Holland,'' Soule says), and Soule took college courses
in composition when he was in junior high school. He went straight
into the profession at 19.
</P>
<P>
   And the on-line industry is burgeoning. ``The interactive game
industry is opening the door to opportunity, which is always a good
thing,'' says Ron Sobel, assistant vice president of the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Soule is working on self-producing CDs of his music; samples are
available at www.jeremysoule.com. Some of his fellow composers are
lobbying the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to add
a new category for interactive music at the Grammy Awards. Hey,
they award one for Best New Polka, so why not? Besides, the days of
beeps and boops are long over.

   Pascal de Vries has tried and he's tried and he's tried, but he
hasn't been able to get any satisfaction. That might change some
time soon. His popular site, www.lyrics.ch, may be back on-line
next month.
</P>
<P>
   This story begins back in January when de Vries, who lives in
Basel, Switzerland, was approached by the local police seeking to
shut down his lyrics data base, which lists the words to more than
114,000 songs. The reason: The New York-based National Music
Publishers Association accused the site operators of copyright
violations, and Swiss police seized the computers that drive the
site. Since then, De Vries has been negotiating with music
association president and CEO Edward P. Murphy to work out a
licensing deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police came to my house, but I was at work,'' de Vries
recalled. ``They found my colleague in Zurich and took the servers
from there. He was at home, and they questioned him for four hours.
We were really surprised and shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   The site was launched two years ago as an amateur project; de
Vries is in a rock band in his spare time, and he and his fellow
musicians were looking for an easy way to get lyrics so they could
cover songs in English. The little idea grew; its founder says the
site was getting about 1 million hits a day when it was shut down.
He originally used his own money to foot the bill, but as the site
grew, so did costs. Before it was shut down, the site cost about
$40,000 a month to run; it was supported by revenue from
advertisements. De Vries says it just broke even.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, the Swiss musicians didn't own the license to
list the lyrics. Enter the powerful music association. Things were
testy at first, but now it looks like a deal is in the works. De
Vries can't discuss the details, but it looks like the two sides
are going to work out a licensing arrangement or a revenue-sharing
deal. The pact would be unprecedented, setting the stage for the
music association to take its trade into cyberspace in a proactive,
rather than a reactive fashion.
</P>
<P>
   And all those kids in garage bands will be able to find the
words to their favorite covers. De Vries' own band, called First of
May, has a few favorites: ``Hotel California'' and ``Smoke on the
Water.'' And he's looking forward to the day when the smoke finally
clears.

ROSEANNE BARELY GOES SKIN DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week's National Enquirer seemed full of promise. Roseanne
is guest editor. That's thrilling, of course. And the cover story
really set my pulse pounding: stars' beauty secrets.
</P>
<P>
   I've been collecting choice celebrity beauty secrets for years.
Here's one of my favorites, from the Enquirer, circa 1986: Morgan
Fairchild uses mayonnaise as a hair conditioner. She rinses with
lukewarm water, because hot water curdles the eggs. And she always
uses real mayonnaise, not sandwich spread, which makes hair sticky
and hard to manage.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another: Once a week Doris Day coats her entire body with
Vaseline, dons flannel pajamas and then goes to bed, presumably
alone. She claims the Vaseline routine keeps her skin soft. This
one is from ``Doris Day: Her Own Story,'' published in the late
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   These secrets, fascinating though they may be, are dated. So
when I saw the Enquirer cover story I welcomed the opportunity to
add to my collection. The subject seemed seemed a perfect target
for Roseanne's angry, feminist brand of humor.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Roseanne was guest editor of a special women's
issue of the New Yorker. With all due respect to that distinguished
weekly, editing the Enquirer seems more Roseanne's metier. In her
editor's notes she writes that while she's had her differences with
the Enquirer over the years, she's always been a faithful reader.
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne promises ``The wildest edition ever _ I'm in charge!''
But the results are disappointing. The high point may be a
first-pastry account by a Twinkie that claims it was nibbled by
Calista Flockhart (`` . . . she nipped a few crumbs from my end and
put me down . . . I'm the luckiest Twinkie alive!'')
</P>
<P>
   The stars' beauty secrets story doesn't reflect a shred of
Roseanne's attitude. It's an adoring look at 20 celebrities
Roseanne apparently is trying to flatter into appearing on her talk
show. I searched the text for tips in the Vaseline vein, but in
every case, the ``secret'' of the star's beauty is being born
gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   Gwyneth Paltrow has ``luminous . . . flawless'' skin. Cindy
Crawford is ``a natural beauty.'' Thandie Newton ``could wear a
sack and still look stunning.'' Cameron Diaz describes herself as,
``a cheeseurger junkie, a salty greasy girl. . . . I give every
French fry a fair chance.'' Eat up, Cameron. In just a few years
you'll be smearing that grease on your outside, a la Doris Day.
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne's Enquirer issue had only a couple of collectible
secrets. 1) Jaclyn Smith uses a different cream rinse on her hair
every day. 2) Kim Basinger washes her hair with Evian water. I was
hoping for something more, perhaps involving some of the popular
new condiments, balsamic vinegar, maybe, or Inner Beauty hot sauce,
although I realize that in Hollywood only outer beauty matters.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible celebrity beauty secrets are all but obsolete in
an age when the rich and famous rely on plastic surgery to maintain
their looks. Roseanne herself has no beauty secrets. She lays it
all out in a two-page photo essay in which she looks back at her
``amazing 10-year transformation'' from 230-pound TV star to
160-pound TV star. The diets. The breast reduction. The tummy tuck.
The face-lift. The eyelid-lift. Most recently, the Fobi gastric
bypass operation, a radical procedure that drastically reduces the
amount of food a person can eat. Roseanne's transformation is
illustrated with photographs of herself from the Enquirer, some of
them extremely unflattering. No wonder she can't be funny about
stars' beauty secrets. In her business, a woman's looks are no
joke. They're the only thing that matters.

MONICA, UNABASHED, SHOWS STAR POTENTIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A largely unsympathetic nation waited for Monica Lewinsky to
portray herself as a victim _ of the president, of Linda Tripp, of
the media, of Ken Starr. We waited and waited, but in a two-hour
episode of ABC's ``20/20'' Wednesday night, the 25-year-old refused
to play the fragile descendent of Marilyn Monroe. Despite a few
teary moments, and one or two embarrassed blushes, she presented
herself as a strong, articulate, self-aware, sexual, and completely
unashamed adult. She has compared herself to Princess Diana in the
British press recently, but for America she chose to position
herself a bit more toward the Madonna end of the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   And so ``That Woman'' did not attempt to be like Marlo Thomas's
``That Girl.'' She came off more like the racy Fox network
nighttime soap characters played by Shannen Doherty and
Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, actresses whom joking journalists have cast
as Monica Lewinsky in a hypothetical movie. With her newly tamed
hair, her clear and animated eyes, and her sparkling teeth, she
rarely pretended to be suffering during her extended ``20/20''
moment of revelation. At points, her enthusiasm even crossed the
line from poised and honest to exhibitionistic. ``Yes!!'' she said,
laughing, when Barbara Walters calls her a passionate woman.
``Yes!!'' she said, laughing, when Walters asks if she worried
about being caught in flagrante in the Oval Office. Phone sex?
``It's fun,'' she said, laughing. ``He's a good kisser,'' she said,
laughing. If Lewinsky has thought much about the Americans who view
her as a Devil in a Blue Dress, she didn't play to that audience.
And with comments like, ``I don't have the feelings of self-worth
that a woman should have,'' and talk of her psychotropic drug
perscription, she second-guessed those who might try to label her
as painfully deluded or depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly born to thrive in a tell-all culture, Lewinsky made
Barbara Walters's job extremely easy. Walters had only to lob her
expected questions, inserting motherly comments like, ``That was
probably very painful,'' and Lewinsky eagerly shared everything
from intimate sexual details to suicidal thoughts. And that is most
likely how Lewinsky wanted it. Yes, Lewinsky was a fantastic
``get'' for Walters, but Walters was no small get for Lewinsky, who
benefited from Walters's humanizing touch and her unwillingness to
be openly adversarial. Walters was the best possible chaperone into
America's living rooms, just as Oprah Winfrey once provided entree
for an image-battered Michael Jackson. If there was a hint of the
cheap odor of ``The Jerry Springer Show'' in Lewinsky's first TV
interview (``Women Who Fooled Around with the President and Liked
It''), the flowery perfume of Walters managed to smell a little
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   But only a little stronger. The massively promoted event _ which
ABC scheduled on the last night of the sweeps period _ presented an
embarrassment of rich commentary on ``the way we live now,'' as
Anthony Trollope put it. It was the quintessential moment of
1990s-style American self-reinvention, with Lewinsky trying to lift
the curtain for herself on a second act. I kept thinking of Martin
Scorsese's ``King of Comedy,'' which seemed sharply satirical back
in 1983. In the America of that comedy, fame, and infamy were so
inextricably joined at the hip that a desperate kidnapper easily
reinvented himself as a beloved talk-show host. In 1999, Scorsese's
movie is very old news indeed. Courtroom television has turned into
the equivalent of ``Star Search,'' with shady folks like Joey
Buttafuoco and John Wayne Bobbitt and all the performers in ``The
O.J. Show'' emerging as the big ``gets'' on newsmagazines and the
lead characters in made-for-TV movies.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky is the latest in that family of peculiar icons. With
her comfort on camera, could she become a TV celebrity? With her
penchant for self-revelation, could she host a talk show? With her
relentless bubbliness, could she replace Mary Hart on
``Entertainment Tonight''? With her budding legal mind, could she
become a commentator on CNN, MSNBC, etc.? Sure, in this day and
age, and with her self-possession, she probably could _ but let's
hope she doesn't. Let's hope that, once the newsmagazines move onto
other stories of sex and betrayal, and once her book falls off the
best-seller lists, Monica Lewinsky takes her millions of dollars
and goes in search of a (itals)very private(unitals) life. We owe
her _ and ourselves _ as much.

PEOPLE: 25 YEARS OF CELEBRITIES IN SOFT FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As its founding editor Richard Stolley once noted, everything
about the debut People magazine cover was wrong. The subject,
actress Mia Farrow, wasn't looking into the camera and her new
movie, ``The Great Gatsby,'' hadn't even hit the theaters yet.
Meanwhile, in 1974, the mere idea that ``august Time Inc.'' would
launch a celebrity glossy was ``something of a scandal,'' recalls
media analyst Tom Rosenstiel.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as it celebrates a quarter-century of stargazing with
a 336-page issue and a two-hour ``Dateline NBC'' special, People
can be forgiven for musing wondrously over what it has wrought. Not
only is the magazine _ with a 3.64 million circulation and annual
ad revenues of nearly two-thirds of a billion dollars _ a stunning
success. As Barbara Walters's mega-hyped interview with Monica
Lewinsky proves, it has also helped transform the media universe.
</P>
<P>
   People's role as the crossover act that brought celebrity
journalism from the shadowy scandal sheets to the mainstream media
is evident in everything from ABC's Monica-mania to the
glitz-conscious New Yorker under Tina Brown, from Newsweek cover
stories on Don Imus and Nicole Kidman to the gossipy Life pages of
USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   People ``made celebrity journalism more respectable and it also
proved that it could be done elegantly and be enormously
successful,'' says Rosenstiel, vice chairman of the Committee of
Concerned Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as People celebrates 25 years of exceeding expectations
with its brand of literate celebrity journalism, some wonder
whether it is a primary culprit for the voyeurism now preoccupying
the media.
</P>
<P>
   The special 25th-anniversary edition of People skillfully
follows the magazine's formula of ``extraordinary people doing
ordinary things and ordinary people doing extraordinary things.''
The issue updates the fleetingly famous such as Patty Hearst,
Lorena Bobbitt, and Rodney King. It cheers ``profiles in courage''
like the HIV-infected Magic Johnson and James Brady, Ronald
Reagan's press secretary who was seriously wounded in the 1981
assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it features such ordinary ``angels'' as a
20-year-old boy who donated a kidney to his ailing grandmother and
the Congressional Budget Office assistant who dove into the icy
Potomac River to save a victim of a 1982 plane crash. And then
there are the surpassing celebrities, the ``25 Legends of the past
25 years'' who range from Oprah Winfrey to Princess Diana. (The
late princess is the classic People star, having appeared on the
cover a mind-boggling 50 times. She graced three of the magazine's
top 10 best-selling covers.)
</P>
<P>
   No one suggests that People magazine is responsible for Princess
Di's incredible popularity or for creating America's obsession with
celebrity. But to some extent, its rise dovetails with ``a longer
trend of moving the personal into public view,'' says Joshua
Gamson, an associate professor of sociology at Yale. The obsession
with ``celebrity we've always had to a certain degree,'' says
cultural critic Steven Stark. But what's new is ``an obsession with
the personal as political.''
</P>
<P>
   People managing editor Carol Wallace explains her magazine's
appeal more simply: ``I think it's like a best friend to people. I
think there's a bond there. They like to identify with people who
come into their home on the TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to People's success, however, is not simply a focus on
celebrity. It is the canny way in which the magazine straddles the
conflicting reader emotions of envy and admiration provoked by
tales of the rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response to celebrities has always been ambivalent and the
presentation of celebrities has always been ambivalent. . . .
They're just like you and me and they're different from you and
me,'' says Gamson, author of ``Claims to Fame: Celebrity in
Contemporary America.'' ``People is a great purveyor and marketer
of that ambivalence. That's their brilliance.''
</P>
<P>
   In its choice of subject matter, People varies the mix.
Sometimes it portrays stars as ``different from you and me'' _ as
evidenced by its cover stories on the ``25 Most Intriguing People
of the Year'' or its ``40 Most Fascinating Stars of '98.'' Yet,
just as often, it will humanize the travails of celebrities,
publishing a story on the personal problems of model Kate Moss,
Michael J. Fox's battle with Parkinson's disease, and Peggy
Fleming's struggle with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Even as People evinces a tabloid interest in the lives of the
lustrous, however, it displays none of the tabloid culture's
icon-smashing nastiness. ``The celebrity media have two functions _
to envy the famous and to destroy the famous,'' says Stark.
``People has never been into the second.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't write stories that necessarily rock the boat,''
says Mediaweek senior editor Lisa Granatstein. ``It's a nice family
magazine. Everybody can read it and everybody can feel good.'' Even
the recent Chelsea Clinton cover story that sparked White House
charges that People was invading the first daughter's privacy
proved to be a friendly, quasi-puff piece.
</P>
<P>
   Although the magazine earns widespread kudos for what Stark
calls a ``kinder, gentler'' breed of celebrity news, it also
ignites a debate over whether it is culpable for a broader dumbing
down of American journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What People did is they really identified the genre and put it
out there,'' says Fran Shea, the president of the 10-year-old E!
Entertainment Television, which derived inspiration from the
magazine. ``People identified that audiences take celebrity
information very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   A study done by the Committee of Concerned Journalists revealed
that from 1977 to 1997 _ even as People was moving toward a greater
percentage of news or trend covers _ Time and Newsweek doubled the
number of cover stories they published with ``celebrities, a sexy
man or woman or an image story about sex.''
</P>
<P>
   The news magazines and People are ``meeting in the middle,''
says Rosenstiel. People gave ``respectability to a kind of
journalism that is running amok. Unwittingly, they gave a good name
to a less significant kind of journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real mixed,'' says Gamson of People's journalistic
legacy. ``I don't think the focus on individual personalities and
individual stories as a culture-wide phenomenon is a great thing.
(But) the making of personal lives to be publicly relevant, that's
not all bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Media critic and Brill's Content founder Steve Brill believes
People's ``editorial standards are right'' and absolves the
magazine of blame for making it ``possible and palatable'' for less
skilled imitators to follow its lead. ``It always worries me,''
Richard Stolley once noted, ``that we get blamed for something we
clearly can't control.''

IN PRESCHOOL, MULTIPLES THRIVE ON `YOU'RE DIFFERENT PEOPLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether it's the first glass of orange juice at breakfast or the
sleep-tight kiss at night, being first is paramount in the lives of
5-year-old fraternal twins Ziv Arzt and Ezra Porter. Time to get
dressed? ``Put my clothes out first!'' Mom's gonna read a book?
``My book first!'' Time to go to preschool? ``Do my seat belt
first!''
</P>
<P>
   When cries of ``Me first!'' surfaced 18 months ago, parents
Eliza Arzt and Meredith Porter tried to be fair by hooking seat
belts simultaneously and rotating who did what first. But as the
litany grew, it got too hard to keep track. Now Arzt and Porter
have systems _ Ezra is first to get in the car, Ziv is first to get
out _ but they also tell their sons, ``You're two different people
and we can't be absolutely even every time. You two figure this out
and let us know.''
</P>
<P>
   The message, ``You're two different people,'' is one parents of
multiples need to send beginning at birth, but it takes on new
significance in the preschool years when all children struggle with
individuality. For multiples who function as a unit, especially
identicals, it can be particularly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Haigney, director of the Barat Montessori Preschool in
Cochituate, Mass., has seen the process unfold. She describes
identical twin girls who, at the age of 3, were happy to be
mistaken for each other, indeed, encouraged it. At 4, though, she
says, ``They got angry to be called by the wrong name.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing themselves as distinct usually begins at about age 3 and
can take years to complete. Arzt says her sons know who is who and
don't always have to be together, but, she adds, ``There are ways
in which they see the results of what they do as one big thing,
rather than the result of individual efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Me first!'' is one of the early signs of individuation; all
parents with more than one child suffer through it. But with
siblings of different ages, a fight can peter out because the older
one gets bored or the younger one knows she's outmatched.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with multiples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their desires are equally matched and they are at the same
stage of development, so the skills they bring a situation are also
basically equal. That makes competition more intense,'' says
psychologist and twin researcher Nancy L. Segal.
</P>
<P>
   The most valued commodity for any preschooler is mom or dad's
attention. With two, three, or four like-minded children in one
family, that ratchets up the competition. In the Arzt-Porter home,
even with two parents and an older sister, there are days when Mom
feels like a prize. ``It's not enough if I take one downstairs in
the morning and my husband the other,'' she says. ``They both want
me, and they both want to be first.'' (The twins, by the way, have
different last names not to individualize them but so that Eliza
wouldn't be the only Arzt in the family.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parents can't eliminate the need to compete but we can minimize
it by giving each child consistent time alone with each parent,
preferably daily, says British pediatrician Elizabeth Bryan, a
specialist in multiple-birth children. However, she says, don't
feel like your time alone has to be an ``event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this tendency to want to make up for lost time, so we
overstimulate,'' says Bryan. ``Sometimes it's better not to do
anything. Sometimes what a multiple needs most is to do what he
wants peacefully, without interruption. Having you available to him
without competing for your attention is special enough.''
</P>
<P>
   From birth, most multiples, especially identicals, function as a
social unit and tune out the rest of the world. ``That makes them
more socially advanced than single children because they have
experience in making a relationship work,'' says Patricia Maxwell
Malmstrom, president of Twin Services, a nonprofit resource agency
in Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives them hardly any experience in being alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time a twin sits quietly to paint or do a puzzle, she's
either wondering where her co-twin is or the co-twin distracts
her,'' says Bryan. As a result, multiples tend to have a short
attention span. Quiet time with a parent can help with this, too,
especially in the preschool years, she says. Bryan is founder of
the Multiple Birth Foundation in London and author of ``Twins,
Triplets and More'' (St. Martin's Press).
</P>
<P>
   The less experience they have being apart, the harder it can be
for them in the preschool years when some separation is expected.
``Send a singleton to preschool and he's got to separate from Mom.
Send twins, and they have to separate from Mom and each other.
That's expecting a lot,'' says Segal, who is a professor at
California State University at Fullerton. Her new book, ``Entwined
Lives: Twins and What They Tell Us about Human Behavior'' (Dutton),
is due out later this month.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Segal and other researchers recommend keeping multiples together
in preschool, with two exceptions. Many twins develop their own
language, called ``twin speak.'' That's a problem only if they use
it to exclude peers. If that happens, and/or if preschool multiples
also won't play at all with other children, Segal suggests some
degree of separation, perhaps different classrooms for part of the
morning. Otherwise, she says, let the children initiate separation,
even if it takes months, even if all they do is sit on opposite
sides of an art table.
</P>
<P>
   At the Barat Montessori School, the policy is to expose twins to
choices. ``Eventually, even identical twins who were stuck like
glue will choose different things to do,'' says Haigney. Fraternal
multiples, whose interests are more likely to differ, usually have
an easier time, but both identicals and fraternals typically want
to keep tabs on each other. ``A child might leave an activity and
walk across the room to where her twin is playing, not to talk to
her, just to see her,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   What's perhaps most hurtful in the preschool years is when one
twin is very social and the other isn't. ``Parents typically see
this as awful and unfair and they panic, insisting the twins go as
a unit on playdates,'' says Malmstrom. She tells parents to see it
instead as an opportunity for the less social child to have time
alone to do things he likes or time with you. Her rule of thumb:
``Give each child what he needs when he needs it. Your acceptance
and calmness around them not always being together is what will
make it OK.'' This is especially true with boy-girl pairs where the
girl is more socially advanced than the boy, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it comes to discipline, multiples may stick together.
``I've seen situations where a preschool-age twin insists on
sharing punishment even though she wasn't naughty,'' says Segal.
She prefers not to punish two children when only one deserves it,
but she admits it can be hard to prevent a child from sharing in a
consequence if he insists. Bryan says the worst punishment parents
can inflict on multiples is to simply ignore the naughty one and
lavish positive attention on the other(s).
</P>
<P>
   Your time alone with each child can pay off in this arena, too.
``Young children only respond to discipline when there's a tight
bond to the person administering it,'' says Bryan. ``If the closer
bond is to the twin who is egging you on rather than to the parent,
there will be times when they gang up to show off to each other,
and you'll be at a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Arzt calls that ``twin escalation:'' ``One minute everything is
calm, the next there's wild laughter and everything is being taken
apart. I can be at my wit's end in a matter of minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   If both parents are home, one grabs each child to physically
separate and calm him down. If not, Arzt has learned there are
times when togetherness works in her favor. Once a week there's
candy morning, which is earned, among other things, by being in bed
on time. It's a joint reward: For each to get it, both have to
behave.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --It's easier for multiples to see themselves as separate if
parents make a habit of splitting them up for some activities _ mom
takes two to the grocery, dad takes one for a haircut.
</P>
<P>
   --One way to get time alone with each child is to create breaks
in the routine. Instead of a shared bath, mom gives one a bath
while dad reads to the other and vice versa. Or pick a day once a
week or once a month when they take turns not going to preschool
and stay home with you instead.
</P>
<P>
   --In the preschool and toddler years, if they fight over sides
of your lap, lie on the floor. Then there's no lap.
</P>
<P>
   --Researchers encourage schools not to have blanket policies
about separating multiples but to judge each case individually.
</P>
<P>
   --With preschool or elementary school conferences, have separate
meetings for each child. If there are issues to discuss surrounding
their twinship, schedule a third meeting.
</P>
<P>
   --A preschool twin who maliciously scribbles on a co-twin's
paper or ruins something the other is working on may be frustrated
from too much sharing. Try simple adjustments: Does each twin have
a designated place to sleep? Toys and clothes that belong only to
him as well as a place to keep them?
</P>
<P>
   --Whenever possible, make sure your twins or triplets are
hearing this message: ``There's room in our family for both/all of
you to do what you want and succeed at it.''
</P>
<P>
   --Look for neutral ways to rotate who's first: There's an odd
number of letters in one's name, an even number in the other, so
one goes first on odd-numbered days, the other on even days.
</P>

COMING TO A TV NEAR YOU: `THE MONICA SHOW' 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Toward the end of the interview of the century,
Barbara Walters asked Monica Lewinsky where she would go from here.
Besides straight to the bank, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to make a contribution to society, a good
contribution, I think,'' Monica said in her charming,
self-deprecating way. ``I'd like to find the right person, have a
meaningful relationship and have kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Contribution to society? She already made it. She filled the
great conversational void for a full year, fed the voracious media
maw, created new networks, empowered pundits, contributed to the
growth of the Internet and helped grind the Republican Party into
the dust.
</P>
<P>
   She has been The Topic for more than a year, outperforming even
O.J. Simpson. Lord knows what the next Topic is. The millennium
just won't cut it.
</P>
<P>
   I purposely am not reporting many of Monica's priceless quotes
from the interview. I don't want to help promote her book, the
forthcoming ``Monica's Story,'' billed by the leader of her army of
publicists as ``the essential document for closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. The essential tool for closure was the power button on
the television remote, and most Americans probably hit the closure
button at 11 o'clock Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   OK, one more quote. The funniest one was when Barbara asked
Monica why the president had an affair with her. Monica said,
``Sometimes you just need a piece of ... normalcy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she said it with the pause, and ``normalcy'' was the last
word I expected would follow.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have to tell you all the great questions and answers in
the two-hour interview, which featured a lot of $400,000, 30-second
commercials for Advil.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't watch the interview, you don't want to know what
was said.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a normal American, you watched the interview, sucked
up everything that was said and analyzed the semiotics of Monica's
new and very serious hairdo _ flattened with the gel from hell.
</P>
<P>
   She did great.
</P>
<P>
   Not to have watched the interview seems almost un-American, like
not owning a TV in the first place. People who didn't watch it
probably own Volvos and claim they only listen to NPR. Or else they
have standards.
</P>
<P>
   Help, I'm a cog in the Monica publicity machine. I actually
wrote down everything she said and most of what Barbara asked. It
was the perfect match of interviewer and interviewee. Barbara and
Monica melded deliciously like Jell-O and Cool Whip on a hot
summer's day.
</P>
<P>
   Monica told of how the president seemed to indicate he would
marry her, and asked what he would do (pardon the quote) ``when I'm
75 and have to pee 25 times a day.''
</P>
<P>
   She told of how the president felt her pain and how tears came
to his eyes when he broke up with her on D-Day, for ``Dump Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica said she didn't have sex with the president. She had oral
sex, and winningly called it ``messin' around.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it was exciting to be messin' around with the president
while he was talking on the phone to a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   I can't help myself. I'm promoting the book, the essential
document of closure that could make this young woman a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   My bet is that the book will go over slightly better than the
O.J. exercise video, and Monica will have to get a job.
</P>
<P>
   The only real job she ever had was at the Pentagon in public
affairs, perfectly enough. She's gone as far as she can in public
affairs, as far as is humanly possible, in fact. She has to move
on.
</P>
<P>
   When you're only 25 years old and you're a one-name person, the
most famous name on the planet, there's only one place to go. You
have to get your own talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Monica has all the moves. She's personable, articulate, humorous
and has a winning smile. She nods sympathetically. She can tug
heartstrings. She's well-spoken and sincere. She's adorable.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she was naive to think that Clinton loved her for her mind
and soul, but she's grown. She doesn't love him anymore.
</P>
<P>
   After the interview, she's no longer a stalker, a victim, a
vixen and certainly not a bimbo. She is still Monica, but that
could be as in ``On the next Monica ...''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Monica with Barbara Walters was like watching the old
film clip of young Bill Clinton shaking hands with President John
F. Kennedy at that White House conference of dorky student leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It was like seeing royalty and a future successor.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Monica can't replace Barbara, but I hear Oprah is giving
up her time slot to ascend to the Earth goddess Gaia.

UNDERESTIMATING BUCHANAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The verdict on Pat Buchanan's third try for the Republican
presidential nomination is in and it's unanimous. He's all washed
up. The talking heads say so, the press says so, even former
supporters say his time has come and gone. The question arises: How
can they be so sure? The answer is: They don't know what they're
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Underestimating Pat Buchanan is always a mistake. President Bush
(who is my uncle) did it in 1992, to his everlasting regret. Bob
Dole did it in 1996 and his primary campaign all but ran out of
money as a result. Whatever one thinks of him, Buchanan continues
to be a formidable force in Republican Party politics.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he is the most experienced candidate in the field. By
virtue of his two previous campaigns, he enjoys something
approaching 100 percent name recognition among primary voters and
caucus attenders. That's an asset that money can buy, but that
Buchanan no longer need acquire.
</P>
<P>
   He is an accomplished campaigner and knows how to run a
multistate campaign on short money and rechargeable cell phones. He
lives off the land, using radio and TV talk shows to spread the
message. Because he is such a lively and entertaining guest (as
well as a serious commentator), he is a favorite among the
producers and bookers of such shows.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has a strategy, which is not much different from his
1996 campaign plan. He expects that Forbes will spend millions of
dollars on negative campaign commercials cutting George W. Bush
down to size. This will have its effect on Bush and Forbes, and
will enable Buchanan to seize the ideological high ground and
remain competitive in the early going. He won New Hampshire last
time with less than 30 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan knows, better than anyone in the Republican field, the
ideological dynamics of GOP presidential primary politics. He has
been speaking about conservative issues for more than 30 years. He
doesn't need a pollster to tell him which issues hit the hot
buttons of which constituencies within the party's culturally
conservative base. He feels their resentments in his bones.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of the inauthentic politician, Buchanan is the real
thing. He believes most of what he says and is unafraid to say it.
What he will say in this presidential campaign will resonate,
because the issues that he raises are real issues facing the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The global economy really does change our notions of
sovereignty, borders, and identity. Washington really is a sinkhole
of corruption. The Republican Party really has not kept faith with
its most devoted constituencies. And the likelihood is that these
concerns will grow more urgent over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the issue of tax cuts, a core GOP issue. Buchanan
proposes a $1 trillion tax cut. The GOP congressional leadership's
response is that a tax cut may not be in the cards this year.
Indeed, Sunday's New York Times reported that GOP congressional
leaders were working to remove congressional spending restraints
that have been in place since 1990. The truth is that GOP leaders
would like to spend more taxpayer money, not have less to spend.
Buchanan will hammer this issue and he will be right.
</P>
<P>
   Consider foreign aid. Buchanan has consistently opposed US
support for IMF bailouts in emerging market countries. He opposed
the Mexican bailout. He vehemently opposed the Russian bailout. He
argued that American tax dollars should be spent helping Americans,
not bailing out financial elites. This issue may well dominate the
early stages of the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every emerging market country is unprepared to deal
with the Year 2000 computer crisis that looms larger every day. If
the Y2K computer crisis causes even modest disruptions in the
economies of emerging market countries, foreign capital will
evacuate those markets with astonishing speed. This could quickly
lead to a global financial crisis, with America being asked to help
execute 8 or 10 Mexican-sized bailouts simultaneously. That would
add up to $450 billion worth of bailouts. Does anyone think
Buchanan's message, under these circumstances, would fall on deaf
ears?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the issue of impeachment. Everybody, it is said, wants
to put the impeachment issue behind us. Republican primary voters,
particularly cultural conservatives, don't feel that way at all.
They're angry that Clinton wasn't convicted. They're angry that
Juanita Broaddrick's charge of rape has been swept under the rug.
Among presidential candidates, Buchanan's voice has been the most
consistent on the issue of Clinton's conduct. And he will not duck
it. It will be a centerpiece of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   People who dismiss Buchanan's 2000 campaign wish that it would
simply go away. It will not go away. It will gather strength in the
months ahead and it will be formidable in Louisiana, Alaska, Iowa,
and New Hampshire. Those are the first four states on the primary
and caucus calendar. Buchanan won three of them in 1996.

WHAT'S IN A NAME: MAYBE TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ ``The first call I got,'' Kathy Rosenbaum was
telling me, ``was about a year and a half ago. Somebody called
looking for Jeff Rosenbaum for some equipment he'd ordered. So, I
said, `Oh, baseball equipment?' My husband is heavily into baseball
in this area. And they said, `No, restaurant equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   That made no sense to Kathy Rosenbaum. Her husband, Jeff, is a
certified public accountant. You have the wrong guy, she told the
caller. Jeffrey M. Rosenbaum of the Albany suburb of Schodack has
nothing to do with the restaurant business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I started getting more calls for Jeff _ baking ovens he
had ordered. They were calls from New York City. I told them they
had the wrong person. They said, `Fine.' Then they started getting
more insistent when they called several weeks later. I would say,
`How did you get our number?' And they would say they called
directory assistance. And we're the only ones listed under Jeffrey
Rosenbaum ... Then they started getting belligerent.''
</P>
<P>
   There were nastier messages on the Rosenbaums' answering
machine. Pay up, the callers would say. Your check bounced, and
we're going to the cops. Kathy would call back and say the caller
had the wrong Jeff Rosenbaum. The callers would threaten her
husband with jail.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Kathy Rosenbaum went to the New York State Police. She
and her husband hired a lawyer to communicate with these furious
creditors. Ultimately, they learned that there was another Jeff
Rosenbaum among the one million or so residents of the Albany metro
area _ a Jeffrey D. Rosenbaum and not Jeffrey M. Rosenbaum, the CPA
_ and that Jeffrey D. Rosenbaum was in the restaurant supply
business.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a horror show, Kathy Rosenbaum said. All these
calls, all these threats from creditors her husband doesn't know
and doesn't owe, probably 150 of them.
</P>
<P>
   I got some idea last week what it must have been like for
Jeffrey M. Rosenbaum and his wife, Kathy, when I mentioned Jeffrey
D. Rosenbaum in a column. Ed Novak, who operates a pizzeria, had
sworn out a criminal complaint against him for allegedly writing a
bad check. After taking some abuse from a court clerk _ and aware
that Jeffrey D. Rosenbaum's wife is an assistant Albany County
district attorney _ Novak began to fear that he might not get
justice in the village court of suburban Ravena, population 3,500,
where nobody ever seems to be paying attention to what the little
local dukes and duchesses are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Once that column ran, my phone rang right off the hook. Person
after person, company after company. They all were complaining that
Jeffrey D. Rosenbaum had stiffed them, had written them bad checks.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if any of that is true. But I do know that Jeffrey
D. Rosenbaum has a serious history of such problems in other parts
of New York. He has done jail time. He has at least one bankruptcy.
He has had problems holding on to a driver's license. I tried to
talk to him about all this, but his phone is unlisted. Clearly,
this is a guy with problems.
</P>
<P>
   I feel bad for people with problems. But I feel worse for people
like Jeffrey M. Rosenbaum, the CPA from Schodack, and his wife,
Kathy, who also ended up with problems, and through no fault of
their own. They and their three kids have been subjected for 18
months now to harassing phone calls and angry threats of arrest.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of thing is grim but not uncommon. There are,
according to an Internet search I conducted, 52 Daniel Lynches
living among New York state's 18 million residents. One time, when
I bought a house on Long Island, I had to sign an affidavit stating
that I wasn't four of them.
</P>
<P>
   The point is simply this: We live in a big, complex society
where about a million Americans a year have problems so severe that
they're forced into bankruptcy. And, if they have the wrong name,
their problems can become your problems, too.

WATER-RICH CANADA WARY OF THIRSTY US

 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Canada holds a fifth of the world's fresh water
supply, but doesn't want to share a drop, at least not for now. And
especially not with its increasingly thirsty neighbor to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated as much by raw nationalism as environmentalism, and
with an eye toward one day becoming the OPEC of H(2)O, Canada is
seeking to ban bulk sales of water to foreigners _ the first
``water-rich'' nation to attempt to block the flow of a resource
that some specialists predict will become the most valuable
commodity of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   With little fanfare and less public debate, Parliament last
month voted unanimously for a moratorium on bulk exports of water,
cloaking its action in Queen and flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water is as Canadian as hockey, as the Mounties, as the
beaver,'' said Bill Blaikie, a member of Parliament from Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   Said International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi: ``Canadians
feel extremely passionate about water.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it seemed a curious move for a country whose economy
depends heavily on extracting and exporting fabulous quantities of
non-renewable resources, from gold to natural gas. No one one seems
to worry too much about reserves of Canadian oil or iron ore, but
water gets the blood pumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't drink oil,'' explained Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's water, of course, is a resource that each hour
replenishes itself by the billions of gallons. Every day, the St.
Lawrence River alone disgorges into the Atlantic the equivalent of
10.1 million railroad tanker car loads of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   The vote by Parliament, although scarcely noticed outside
Ottawa, may turn out to have been the starting gun in a new global
scramble for resources.
</P>
<P>
   As the millenium approaches, the world's thirst for water is
growing at a stunning rate, with global demand doubling every 21
years. By the year 2025, the World Bank predicts, more than 3
billion people in 52 countries will suffer from chronic shortages
in water for drinking or sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   Even rich countries may be forced to reduce consumption
drastically _ especially agricultural use _ or search outside their
boundaries for sources of the life-giving liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Canada's extraordinary wealth of water, many
observers say the new moratorium is just a temporary stopgap,
giving Ottawa and the provinces time to devise a coherent water
policy _ and pricing strategy _ before opening the resource to the
highest bidders. They say Canada is less interested in keeping
water permanently away from bulk buyers than devising a plan to
circumvent the North American Free Trade Agreement and ensure that
Canadian companies _ not avaricious Americans _ profit most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada is a future OPEC of water,'' said Terence Corcoran,
business editor of the National Post, a Toronto-based daily
newspaper known for sober-minded financial coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Canada may even be moving on US water: a Canadian company has
quietly won the first North American license to ship bulk
quantities of drinking water to China _ from a pristine lake in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Global Water Corporation of Vancouver, British Columbia, in
a precedent-setting deal that attracted surprisingly little
attention, plans to siphon 18.2 billion gallons a year from Blue
Lake near Sitka, Alaska, for shipment to bottling plants in China,
one of the countries most threatened by looming shortages.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 report to shareholders, Global Water noted that
``consumption of water products is growing at a rate faster than
any beverage product.''
</P>
<P>
   Among environmentalists and economists, there is widespread
agreement that water shortages will become commonplace in the
coming decades, and that countries that control fresh water will be
kings of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 2010, Canada will be exporting large quantities of fresh
water to the US, and more by tanker to parched nations all over the
globe,'' Corcoran wrote in a recent article. ``The issue will not
be whether to export, but how much money the federal government and
the provinces will be able to extract from the shipments.''
</P>
<P>
   A study by the World Bank recently forecast that the planet's
rapidly expanding population will drain lakes and mighty rivers,
causing calamitous shortages of water for irrigation, drinking, and
sanitation. Water is being pumped at dangerous rates from exhausted
underground aquifiers throughout Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and
even parts of the United States, such as southern California and
several Midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for dwindling shares of the resource is already
intense, and could become ferocious. Stated the World Bank: ``Wars
of the next century will be over water.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's water moratorium, which has yet to be tested under free
trade treaties like NAFTA, is aimed straight at the United States,
where several businesses are quietly hatching plans to siphon off
shiploads of water from Canadian lakes for delivery to dusty
agricultural lands in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect has plainly spooked Canada. Politicians there vow
to protect the resource as nationalists thump up anti-American
sentiment by suggesting that their nation's pristine lakes and
rivers are about to be sucked dry by greedy US agribusiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing freaks out Canadians like the idea of American
supertankers coming in and taking off our water,'' said Maude
Barlow, head of the Council of Canadians, a nationalist lobbying
group that believes free trade treaties have left Canada vulnerable
to economic rape by its powerful neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water is our lifeblood,'' said Barlow, who favors a flat ban
on bulk water exports, except for humanitarian shipments. ``Once
the tap is open, no one can turn it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa is urging the 10 provinces, which share control of water
with the federal government, to help devise forceful strategies for
better guarding the nation's hoard.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the hullabaloo over water comes at a time of year
when Canadians from Niagara Falls to the high Arctic are hip deep
in the stuff, in the form of snow. Canada posseses the simple
compound of hydrogen and oxygen in more staggering abundance than
any other nation. Scientists estimate that 20 percent of the
earth's entire bounty of fresh water lies untouched in this country
of only 30 million people. Much of Canada remains virgin
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   A bit less than half of Canada's fresh water is renewable and,
at least theoretically, accessible from rivers, lakes, and
underground flows. The rest is so-called ``fossil water,'' locked
in glaciers and the permanent ice shield that covers the far north.
</P>
<P>
   On a per capita basis, Canada boasts 11 times as much renewable
fresh water as the United States: about 28.7 million gallons for
every woman, man, and child, compared to 2.6 million gallons per
American, according to UN figures.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens of the two countries are by far the world's most
prolifigate users of water, consuming 100 gallons per day per
person (Canada's average is slightly lower) _ most of it flushed
down the toilet or bath drain. The average person drinks only about
2 quarts per day.
</P>
<P>
   American/Canadian household consumption is nearly three times
higher than the European average, and 25 times greater than
personal consumption in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in rich and poor countries alike, water quaffed from
drinking glass or drawn into the bath is but a drop compared to the
stupefying amounts lavished on crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irrigation is far and away the biggest consumer of water
worldwide, accounting for about 80 percent of use,'' said Sandra
Postel, director of the Global Water Policy Project, a research
group based in Amherst, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, the most obvious new source is Canada,
which uses only the tiniest fraction of its available water to
slake its thirst, water its crops and turn the turbines of its
mammoth hydroelectric dams.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies clamoring for access to the water wealth of
the northern neighbor is Sun Belt Water Inc. of Santa Barbara,
which during the mid-1990s sought the right to ship tanker loads of
water from British Columbia to California. British Columbia killed
the deal and imposed a provincewide ban on bulk water exports. Sun
Belt is now seeking compensation of $220 million from Canada,
claiming the ban violates NAFTA, the free trade pact signed by the
United States, Canada, and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Trade specialists say that if Canada permits even a single
shipload of water to be exported, water will automatically become a
``tradeable commodity'' under NAFTA. That means US companies would
legally have the same rights as Canadian firms to exploit and
export the resource.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadian water would come under as much pressure as Canadian
culture is already under from the American juggernaut,'' warned
Barlow.

E-NOUGH E-MAIL! 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Everyone tells me I am being troglodytic and/or
selfish. But I really, really hate getting e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude probably speaks volumes about my creativity,
intestinal fortitude, intelligence and possibly childhood toilet
training; I don't care. E-mail is my idea of hell.
</P>
<P>
   I don't ``do'' e-mail at home, and I wish I didn't get it at
work.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was only recently that I found out that I have an
e-mail address at work. My Aunt Linda from Ohio called and said:
``Why don't you ever answer my e-mails?''
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Turned out I'd been getting e-mail messages from lots of
people for months. According to one of our computer helpers,
hundreds and hundreds of messages were causing ``our mail server to
get a little clogged up.''
</P>
<P>
   My ignorance was not the newspaper's fault. For two years I have
deliberately hidden from anything that looks like Internet access
training. A couple of times I hid in the women's room when
mandatory training sessions were held across the hall from my
office. Always, I managed to slip through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   You may love e-mail. Your friends and associates may love it.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate, academic and governing America obviously love it and
run on it. But I don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   Why is that such a crime? As I have explained to dozens of
e-mail-touting friends, family and bosses, I am quite happy with
the two methods of communication I grew up with: letters and phone
calls. They are all I need and definitely all I want.
</P>
<P>
   As for people's ability to communicate with me here at the
office, I am accessible via three wide, accommodating boulevards:
``snail mail,'' voicemail and fax. For 11 years, traffic along
these byways has kept me busy, busy, busy. In fact, as I have
written before, I have more communication than I can handle and am
notoriously inept at answering mail.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not proud of this. It's a flaw for sure _ or maybe a kind of
disability. But it's a deep flaw and not likely to soon disappear
without secretarial help.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't because I don't care, don't value suggestions to ``go
back to sportswriting'' or to the kitchen, to Russia or to ``your
father, Satan, where you belong.'' I just don't have time in a
five-day work week to do my job and compose a personal reply to all
the letters that demand one. Even the nice letters.
</P>
<P>
   What I can do is read all the letters, react in anger,
frustration, pity, compassion or happiness and _ once in awhile _
get an idea for another column. And I can file the letters for
posterity in a subject-appropriate folder.
</P>
<P>
   Why would I want to open another avenue of communication,
especially an avenue that tends to bring out the dump-and-run
artist in so many folks?
</P>
<P>
   Reams have been written about the nature of e-mail, how it
``frees'' people to just say whatever pops into their minds,
release it into cyberspace then go about their business with little
thought of the consequences. Unlike a letter, e-mail requires no
time to buy stamps, address envelopes or go to the post office, no
time for second thoughts, cooling off or reconsideration. Unlike a
phone call, e-mail does not require the intimate commitment of the
human voice.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my pleadings, my newspaper (understandably) won't make
an exception for me. So, if you want to, if you must, you can send
me e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   For your effort, you may rest assured that I will look at your
message _ sooner or later. But, please remember: I don't like
e-mail, I don't want e-mail and e-mail will always be the last
thing I get to.

INTEL INSIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp.'s antitrust trial has gone into recess, and
already I miss the sheer entertainment value of it.Antitrust trials
aren't supposed to be fun. But then, the leaders of the world's
most feared corporation aren't supposed to seem like gibbering
half-wits, either. But that's how they looked after Justice
Department hired gun David Boies cross-examined them.
</P>
<P>
   What will the feds do for an encore? Well, the Federal Trade
Commission will square off against chip maker Intel Corp. next
week, in an effort to prove Intel has abused its power in the
microchip market. Another amusing fiasco? I doubt it. Intel will go
into its trial with advantages that should allow the firm to avoid
utter humiliation, and perhaps even prevail.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the witness list features Andrew Grove, Intel's
chairman and former chief executive. You don't know how smart a
move this is unless you've met both Gates and Grove.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, we'll all have computers that are capable of
transmitting conversation. When that day arrives, everybody will
know what it's like to question Bill Gates. For all his
incandescent smarts, Gates radiates an eerie sense of disconnection
from the world of flesh and blood.
</P>
<P>
   This may have been one reason why Gates testified in a video
deposition for the Microsoft trial, rather than in person. If so,
it didn't work. The man's creepy detachment was in full effect,
made worse by answers which must have seemed sly to Gates but
appeared arrogant and evasive to everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Grove, on the other hand, is easily the most engaging and
likable computer industry executive I've met. I think it's because
he's a grown-up _ a Hungarian refugee from communism who worked as
a busboy to pay his way through City College of New York. Grove had
a fully-formed adult life before he'd ever heard of a PC, and it
shows. He won't make Intel look bad, and as the Microsoft
experience proves, that counts for a lot.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Intel has some decent arguments on its side.
Remember what the FTC case is all about. Computer companies that
build Intel chips into their machines need detailed technical
information on those chips. In the midst of intellectual property
disputes with Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph Corp. and Compaq
Computer Corp., Intel cut off access to this technical information.
The FTC charges that Intel could harm rivals by withholding this
information.
</P>
<P>
   But only one of the companies _ Digital, now owned by Compaq _
made a competing chip. The others weren't direct Intel competitors.
Can Intel engage in unfair competition with noncompetitors? That's
a tricky new excursion in antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's biggest advantage in the case becomes apparent by
reading the latest computer sales figures. The case against the
company ultimately rests on the idea that Intel has monopolized the
microprocessor market, just as Microsoft monopolizes desktop
operating systems with its Windows software. Microsoft says that
despite its 90 percent market share, it's not a monopoly _ a silly
claim that has undermined Microsoft's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Intel's share of the processor chip market has also
hovered in the 90 percent range. But last week, Intel got a timely
bit of bad news. In January, 43 percent of all PCs sold in retail
stores used K6 chips from Intel's rival Advanced Micro Devices
Inc., according to PC Data Inc. Only 40 percent of the machines had
Intel inside.
</P>
<P>
   According to International Data Corp., Intel's still far in
front of the overall chip market, with 75 percent of all PCs sold
in the fourth quarter. But that's down from 87 percent the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   Intel may have had a monopoly when the FTC began filing its
papers June 8, but it's begun to dissolve even before the trial
starts. Last month, the FTC amended its complaint to attack Intel's
dominance in computer motherboards, which suggests the government's
case looks a lot weaker than it did a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC may still beat Intel, but it won't be a Microsoft-style
carpet-bombing. Intel has good arguments on its side, a dwindling
market share and a legal team that's had a chance to learn from
Microsoft's disasters. I expect a traditional antitrust case _
orderly, workmanlike and dull. Too bad.

ADDING BEEPS TO THAT RINGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you carry around one of those nifty digital cell phones,
there's something that you should know: besides a telephone, you
are also carrying around an alphanumeric pager!
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, all of the national wireless
providers, and many of the regional ones, have added paging to
their mix of services.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, some companies, like Omnipoint, have been offering
paging since they launched their service. Other companies, like
Sprint PCS, have had paging built into their systems for a long
time, but have only recently started advertising the capability.
</P>
<P>
   The whole idea of sending a page to a cell phone makes a lot of
sense. After all, a functioning cell phone is always turned on, and
it's always listening for an incoming telephone call. Making the
cell phone also listen for a page doesn't take any more hardware or
power, it just takes a bit more programming.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, today's cell phones have relatively large bitmapped
graphical displays, so they already have what's necessary to
display pages once they are received. From a carrier's point of
view, page messages are tiny, so they don't take any significant
capacity away from normal telephone operations. And they're
reliable, since the cell phones acknowledge each message that they
receive. Unlike a traditional one-way pager, you won't lose a Short
Messaging Service, or SMS, message, as these pages are properly
known, if you happen to be underground when it is sent.
</P>
<P>
   But don't throw away your conventional pager just yet. The
reason that some wireless phone carriers have been slow to market
SMS services isn't technology, but marketing, education, and
internal personnel issues. It's easier for a company to sell a
service that customers understand, like two-way voice
communications, than to try to sell something new, like a combined
cell phone, pager, calculator, datebook, things-to-do list, e-mail
system and fax machine. That's too bad, because the only difference
between what these companies are offering today, and what they
could be selling, is programming.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the delay is pricing: companies haven't yet
decided if they will make more money by bundling in advanced data
services as part of their basic offering, or if they'll do better
by charging extra for them.
</P>
<P>
   A final problem is corporate training: currently there is a
severe shortage of engineers, technically apt sales people, and
even good customer service reps. In this environment, companies are
concentrating on their core services before they branch out. So
paging today is merely a taste of the integrated features that will
be coming in the future, but it will be some time before we get the
goodies that today's technology can deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I find this incredibly frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks I've been experimenting with the paging
services offered by AT&AMP;T Wireless, Bell Atlantic, Omnipoint, and
Sprint PCS. (CellularOne and Nextel both offer the services as
well, but I didn't have any phones from those companies handy.)
Although the underlying technology that delivers the pages to the
cell phones works pretty well, all of the companies need to work on
the way that pages are sent and displayed.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to send a page to somebody's cell phone, you have
two choices: send it by e-mail, or send it over the Web using a Web
browser. Unlike a conventional pager offered by companies like
Skytel or Pagenet, you can't simply call an 800-number and dictate
a message to an operator.
</P>
<P>
   To send a page by e-mail, you simply send a message to a special
Internet address, say, 16175551212(at)omnipoint.net. To send a page
using a Web browser, you click to a special Web page and fill out a
form.
</P>
<P>
   For every provider I tried, sending a message by the Web was
both faster and more reliable: Web-based messages were typically
delivered in seconds, whereas messages sent by e-mail usually took
a few minutes, sometimes as long as an hour, and were occasionally
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Each provider's service is different _ and the differences can
be maddening. With some services, you have to include the ``1''
when you specify a phone number in an email address. Other services
don't want you to type the ``1.''
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm's CDMA paging technology, used by both Sprint and Bell
Atlantic, allows you to specify a callback phone number; get a page
with a call back, and you can return a call to that number with the
press of a button. CellularOne allows a callback number, but AT&AMP;T
doesn't. Omnipoint's GSM technology is actually a two-way paging
system: you can receive pages, reply to them, or initiate your own!
With Omnipoint, it's easy to send messages to another GSM phone,
but extremely difficult to send messages to standard Internet
e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   (Contrast this with the two-way pagers offered by both Skytel
and Bell South, which allow you to send e-mail to any Internet
address you wish, as well as fax machines and conventional
telephone numbers.)
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is pricing. Omnipoint gives its customers 10
free pages each month, or you can buy a package of 30 pages/month
for $9.99. Sprint gives free numeric paging to all of its
customers, but text paging costs an additional $1.99/month for 30
messages, $9.99/month for 500 messages. Check with the other
vendors for their plans.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the real attraction of paging is to turn my cell phone
into a combination datebook and reminder service. For example, you
can send yourself a message tomorrow morning at 9:15 so you don't
miss that important 9:30 meeting. This is such a simple idea that
it is fairly surprising that only one of the providers, Cellular
One, is offering service on its Web sites. Last weekend, after I
missed a very important meeting, I decided to write my own. My Web
site also tries to mask the difference between the different pager
services, making them somewhat easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   You can try it out on my demo page, http://simson.net/page.
Another way to accomplish this same thing is by using
UserLandSoftware's Mail To The Future service, at
http://mailtothefuture.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to send e-mail messages to phones is just one more
example of the way that the lines between all kinds of computerized
systems are blurring. Cellular telephones aren't really ``phones''
_ they're high-speed mobile computers with many megabytes of RAM,
long-term storage, a sound card, batteries, and a wireless network
interface. What's really needed now is for manufacturers to open up
their systems so that small companies, college students, and even
hobbyists can write their own programs for these computers. More
about that next week.

NEW CHIEF KNOWN AS A CRITIC OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The new chairman of the state Board of Education
champions vouchers and charter schools, makes no secret of his
dismay with traditional public education, and sends his own child
to a suburban private school, Milton Academy.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable, observers said Wednesday, is that James A.
Peyser, who believes in privatization of almost every aspect of
government, will now be in charge of setting the agenda for one of
the state's largest bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who espouses charter schools and choice like that is
basically saying they want to abandon public education,'' said Jack
Rennie, chairman of the Massachusetts Business Alliance, a group
advocating education reform. ``We basically have a fox in charge of
the chicken coup.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rennie and others at odds with Peyser's market-driven
philosophy Wednesday described Peyser himself as a reasonable,
low-key figure who they believe will work smoothly with the
nine-member board and the new education commissioner, David
Driscoll, a former math teacher who is well liked in the education
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they will do well together,'' said Senator Robert A.
Antonioni, a Leominster Democrat who is cochairman of the
Legislature's Education Committee. ``They are even-tempered
individuals who can have disagreements without fireworks.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Wednesday, Peyser said that while state
government clearly must play a role in education, more attention
must be paid to whether and how well programs help students
achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not continue to fund and renew grants when there is
no evidence of such improvement,'' he said. ``There is too much
complacency in terms of assured revenue and assured survival, no
matter how poorly students perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hard work of teachers and others, Peyser said,
parents and children are the ``customers'' of public education
``and not part of the system, and they need to be given options.''
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll, in an interview, said he has always found common
ground with Peyser, a board member from 1995 until resigning in
December to run for commissioner. Even if there are disagreements,
Driscoll said, ``I will implement what the majority votes, my
feelings aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Peyser's politics, Antonioni and others noted that
it is ultimately the entire board, not Peyser alone, who will
juggle the tough issues facing the board, such as teacher testing
and what to do for schools that do not improve poor MCAS results.
</P>
<P>
   The board's reputation has suffered somewhat under the tough
hand of John Silber. Its often contentious public debates got more
attention than its decisions. As some see it, the board's job now
is to help the commissioner and Education Department get reforms
underway, not quibble over policy that was set long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Peyser's very passion for policy might get in the way, said one
critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we have a policy overload, and policy is a weak
instrument for bringing about change in the classroom,'' said Paul
Reville, chairman of the state Education Reform Review Commission
and a board member from 1991 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Peyser's approach to being commissioner, Reville said, ``was to
say it was a policy job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is, you have two people with very different
philosophies, and the politically expedient solution has been to
give them both a job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peyser, 42, lives in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood with his
wife and two children, ages 2 and 6. He runs the Boston-based
Pioneer Institute for Public Policy Research, a think tank that
espouses limited government and a market-driven approach to all
aspects of public policy. Peyser said he would still run the
Pioneer Institute, in the role of chairman, a nonpaying job.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Abigail Thernstrom, an ardent Silber critic, said
Peyser is not a strident ideologue intent on smashing the education
bureacracy. He is more interested, she said, in easing the hand of
government in certain areas.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Peyser would rather see teachers choose their own
professional development programs than have the state pick them,
she said. ``He would say, `Let teachers themselves make education
reform work.' And I agree with him.''

<P>
   Some ideas not worth thinking.
</P>
<P>
   (1) Skiing is pricing itself out of business.
</P>
<P>
   This is a lament I hear at least 10 times per winter, often from
colleagues around the sweatshop in which I labor. Most recently, it
was voiced over the ``suggested retail'' for a pair of the latest
generation of shaped skis: $550.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ridiculous!'' thundered my fellow inked-stained wretch.
``Who's going to pay that kind of money for a pair of skis?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, no one. Or, let's amend that to read, no one
except the guy who has enough bucks to tear them up into shreds and
let the winter wind blow them away. Or the guy whom Darwin has
targeted as ``the fool and his money'' who will soon be parted?
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, there is a world-wide overproduction of skis each
year, which in late summer get shipped in all their new-graphics
glory to the retail shops.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first powder has graced the first 4,000-foot summit,
those ski shops, fearful they will be stuck with their inventory,
begin marking them down in what becomes a ferocious price war.
</P>
<P>
   By post-Christmas, the prices get closer to the bone, and long
before midwinter Presidents' Day vacation, the ``end of season''
sales are in full flower.
</P>
<P>
   The really wise buyer waits until the following October when
such retailing giants as Ski Market sell last year's items at about
half that original $550 suggested retail price.
</P>
<P>
   Sooo, what about all of the other costs of skiing? Like Aspen's
$62 daily lift ticket price?
</P>
<P>
   Well, for starters, anyone who drives into Aspen (or Vail or
Deer Valley, etc.) and buys a retail-priced one-day lift ticket
fits into one of the two categories above and is crying out to get
rid of his cash.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, let's face facts: Anyone who goes to Aspen (or Vail or
Deer Valley) in the first place is not exactly counting pennies.
These are the high-priced spreads, and that means there is a
medium-priced and even a low-priced spread out there, which deliver
fine and fabulous skiing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, from Lake Louise to Gunstock, there are extremely
lovely and affordable ski experiences all over this country. One
might even be forced to admit, the dizzying pace of life in the
sprawl-mall of Vail or overly-precious Aspen, can be a bit of a
downer for those seeking a pristine relationship with winter
outdoor beauty.
</P>
<P>
   For those Rocky Mountain fortresses of wealth to set the
psychological standard for what we might loosely term
``contemporary ski life'' is ridiculous. Fact is, with twining of
no-growth laws and beautiful-people syndrome, Aspen's average house
sells for close to $2 million, and a single-room sublet in the
basement of a Vail condo rents for $800 per month. Does that sound
like the real world?
</P>
<P>
   The point is the same now as it was when Henry Ford first
figured out that it didn't matter how many cars he could turn out
unless there was a middle class to buy them. As long as there are
mountains and people who want to slide down them, skiing and
boarding will be around.
</P>
<P>
   (2) The easier skiing gets, the more fun it is.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I plead guilty to having extolled the virtue of shaped
skis as they bloomed on the market in the last four years, but then
I'm an over-50 guy carrying, ahh, just a little extra baggage
around on football knees. To have some real performance skis that
made carving a turn that much easier, has been a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   But more generally, the trend to broad white-paved boulevards _
once the standard for that ubiquitous ``intermediate'' skier _ is
now, well, boring. So skiers and riders looking for more, headed to
the back country, the glades, the unbroken powder of the untouched
high country.
</P>
<P>
   If easier were better in a universal sense, then why not extend
the rule to golf? Let's do away with sand traps and water hazards.
Let's put electronic homing devices in the ball that correct bad
shots and send the ball straight to the green.
</P>
<P>
   Let's liberate the classic angler from all that fuss over the
right fly and the perfect presentation. Why not just a worm and a
hook to lure a hungry brown trout? Why not take the gutters off
bowling alleys so that the errant shot careens off the wall and
still nails the pins?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, easy is not some ultimate goal, and skiing enjoyed
its greatest growth and enthusiasm nearly 40 years ago in an era of
hard, stiff hickory, soft leather, narrow twisting trails with
ungroomed crud.
</P>
<P>
   As Mt. Cranmore's Herbert Schneider points out, it used to take
at least six years to work one's way from novice, through the
layers of lessons, to the true intermediate who could, if the trail
weren't too steep, link some turns together in the wedlen look that
all skiers craved.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, skiing may be easier to learn now than it used to
be, but a real learning curve is still there, drawing the turned-on
neophyte back for ever more. ``Learn to ski in a day'' is a
marketing overstatement, and breaking out of the intermediate
plateau still takes real effort. Just when you think you have the
sport knocked, try trees and serious bumps, or maybe a few ice
drills.

WARMING TO THE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   March.
</P>
<P>
   It's a month that totters between the giddy anticipation of
spring and a reveling in the snowiest time of the year.
</P>
<P>
   March is when the subsurface ice cap built up through months of
the freeze/thaw cycle begins to soften, when big dumps of natural
snow accumulate in the final blustery weeks of winter.
</P>
<P>
   March is when loyalties are torn between those first rounds of
golf, early cod and trout fishing, and the very best skiing of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get one of those really nice March weekends when it
feels like spring,'' says Mark Chasse, a part-time ski instructor
who lives on the Cape and commutes to New Hampshire on weekends,
``you have to really work to remind yourself that the skiing's
going to be great, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the age-old conundrum: How, in the best ski weeks of the
year, do ski areas keep the skiers from drying up long before the
snow melts?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is perception,'' says Conrad Klefos, marketing vice
president at Jay Peak in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom. ``The problem
we've had this year is with the day market. People look out the
window and if they don't think the snow's really there, they choose
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Particuarly after last season, which most people give the
highest marks, this winter has so far been a disappointment. There
have been some very fine days of skiing, but periods of snow
drought, warmer-than-usual weather, and rain in the snowbelt have
taken their toll. When the books are closed, few areas will be
boasting. For most, skier visits will be well off record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   And, yet, it is only March. At Jay, the largest single snowfall
and record crowd occurred in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year,'' says Klefos, ``we had a four-day dump late in
March that added up to 43 inches of snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in that month, Jay was packed the weekend of Good Friday
_ a day all Quebec residents get off. The long weekend, combined
with excellent snow conditions, brought 4,400 skiers to the
mountain. The average good ski day bings out about 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, anything like that could still happen,'' says Klefos,
noting that within three weeks of the big storm last year, a
``nuclear'' meltdown had occurred, all the snow was gone, and the
mountain closed.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the effort to draw skiers focuses on price packaging
aimed at making the planning of a ski vacaiton attractive enough
for skiers to take a chance on the conditions. Jay, for example,
offers a March package that offers free skiing to skiers who pay
for an on-mountain weekend (or longer) rental. Since the area is
the most popular ski mountain among Montrealers, Jay reaps a bonus
when Canadians plan a four-day Easter weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the underlying problem in March on a bad snow year
is compounded if skiers are unaware that the skiing is, in Klefos's
words, ``really pretty good. We may not have a lot of base in the
glades, and have to close some steep face chutes, but we've had
some good skiing this winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay, New England's greatest annual natural snow recipient with
more than 200 inches, is off by 61 inches so far this season, or 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   At Maine's Sugarloaf, the snow has also been up and down, with
the good snowfall almost always interspersed with a warm, rainy
spell. But by mid-February the area was finally able to announce
the opening of the Snowfields, the area's standard for measuring
its optimum conditions, since it's the only above-timeline skiing
in the East.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the skiing finally gets good,'' says Leah Steven, a
spokesman for the area, ``we have to try to get the word out. It's
really word of mouth. We had great skiing during February vacation,
and the week after that a lot more people came up here to ski. You
could just tell, the word spread when skiers went home and talked
about their experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But experienced skiers know that, on average, March is the best
month to ski. ``If I had my choice,'' says Chasse, ``I wouldn't
even go skiing in New England until February. Then hit it really
hard until the meltdown in April. In March it's warmer but not mush
season yet. The light is better, you're in better shape, and the
crowds are getting smaller _ you can get good deals. No question
it's the month to ski.''
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of the March deals around the slopes, similar to
Jay's ``Ski Free'' slopeside vacations: Mad River in Vermont has a
$175 weekend ski-and-stay package ($75 midweek); Tenney cuts its
lift ticket to $32 weekends, $17 weekday; Mt. Snow offers a $61
midweek and $70 weekend package; Killington allows kids 12 and
under to ski free when parents buy a five-day lift ticket; Stowe
has a five-day ski-and-stay package at $69 per day, and the Blue
Hills offers half prices.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the areas are giving away the skiing, says one
manager in Vermont, ``but this is the time of year when it becomes
a real buyer's market.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ On almost any clinic day, the voices of professional
singers can be heard scaling octaves in Dr. Steven Zeitels's
examining rooms at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Some end up
having surgery; others voice therapy. While the singers provide the
music, it is Zeitels's cancer patients who provide the drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man is touched by God,'' said 60-year-old Jesus Lopez of
Boston. Lopez was at the clinic for a postoperative checkup after
losing a major part of his larynx, or voice box, to vocal-cord
cancer. ``Because of him,'' said Lopez, a two-pack-a-day smoker for
37 years, ``I am still talking to you in my own voice and not
through a machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Under standard surgical procedure, Lopez might have required a
laryngectomy, the total removal of his voice box. With that, he
would have had to speak with the aid of a device. Zeitels found a
less drastic way to remove his cancer. Since his surgery, Lopez
breathes partially through a tube in his trachea, or windpipe. Yet,
he exults in the fact that he can still talk with his own voice and
might someday breathe on his own.
</P>
<P>
   At 41, Zeitels is highly regarded worldwide for his skill and
the pioneering surgical procedures he designs and performs, often
with instruments he invents. He has been saving voices and lives of
throat cancer patients for 10 years. The goal, as Zeitels sees it,
is to do ``minimally invasive surgery'' not only to heal patients
but to preserve their quality of life. ``The key,'' he said, ``is
not organ preservation, per se, but function preservation.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, Zeitels will remove the cancer through the
patient's mouth by using an endoscope, or tube in the throat,
instead of cutting externally and causing disfigurement. Zeitels's
dedication to his patients has brought them to his office from all
walks of life, not only the professional singers, but lawyers,
broadcasters, teachers, and others who damage their voices through
overuse or improper use.
</P>
<P>
   He is so committed to the belief that people should have the
full use of their voices, he treated a street folk singer who had
no medical insurance in exchange for a tape of a rare rock album.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues say that some of the procedures Zeitels has
developed have made them take a second look at what they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of Steve's presentations have really altered how we
should think about disorders of the voice,'' said Dr. Gerald B.
Healy, chief of otolaryngology at Children's Hospital. The two met
when Zeitels was a resident there. ``I see him as a major
contributor to the field. I have been going over to watch some of
his new operating techniques and, I believe, he's developed some
that can be applied to pediatrics,'' Healy said.
</P>
<P>
   Healy said Zeitels's ``phenomenal knowledge of medical history''
of his specialty has enabled him to improve on earlier procedures
with new instrumentation.
</P>
<P>
   The Eye and Ear Infirmary has such faith in Zeitels's work that
it has just created a Division of Laryngology and made him its
director. He works closely with the infirmary's Voice and Speech
Laboratory and is associate professor in the Department of Otology
and Laryngology of Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Zeitels said his work would not be as successful as it is
``without the staff in the lab, people like Bob Hillman,'' its
director. ``We're a team effort here,'' he says. Zeitels sends
almost all of his patients to the lab for speech therapy, whether
they have had surgery or not. Next to the accolades of his
patients, Zeitels said he is particularly proud of being recognized
last year by the American Laryngological Association with its
Casselberry Award for his new procedure in treating vocal cord
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   While challenges seem to invigorate him, so does a heavy daily
hospital schedule. On a recent ``light'' day, he operated on a
cancer patient, a rock singer, and a new-age inspirational
vocalist. That was just before leaving to lecture at a voice
conference in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve's a fixer,'' said folk singer Livingston Taylor, whom
Zeitels treated for vocal cord hemorrhaging. ``He's a guy who is
clear and bold in his desire to find ways of helping people
continue living the type of life they want to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, since Zeitels removed abnormal blood vessels from Taylor's
vocal cords (or vocal folds), and after Taylor went to a voice
management expert, the singer is doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve's great story is not what he does for a couple of
overpaid prima donnas,'' Taylor said. ``It's fine to rescue
Livingston Taylor's career, but it's miraculous to rescue Betty
Doe's ability to speak to her grandchildren. Steve has this
incredible ability to jump in and really work to save people's
speech. He is just ferocious about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeitels proved that, in surgeries he performed on three men with
throat cancer who faced the possibility of a laryngectomy, but
which Zeitels avoided by using a procedure that didn't cause them
any significant loss of function.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The men, like many other patients at the clinic, were eager to
talk to a visitor about how Zeitels had saved their voices.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Gregory, a Boston political consultant, said his throat
cancer resulted from ``smoking too much'' during his 57 years. His
wife, lawyer Mary K. Ames, told of their fear that he might require
a laryngectomy. Ames said she searched the Internet and medical
journals and spoke to other doctors looking for ``the kinds of care
that work and save function'' and the surgeon who could provide
that kind of care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name that kept popping up was Steven Zeitels,'' Ames said.
``We found that Dr. Zeitels is concerned with the total person and
respects the patient's intelligence and fears. His is not
conservative, conventional medicine,'' Ames said, ``but the
brilliant discoveries never are.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of doing a laryngectomy on Gregory, Zeitels removed his
tumor through his mouth by laser. That was followed by radiation
therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Paul Glassett, 43, a hospital security officer from South
Weymouth, wants so much for others to know of Zeitels's work that
he invited a visitor to watch his third surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A nonsmoker, Glassett said he worked as a highway toll collector
for 10 years until stricken with persistent hoarseness and
laryngitis a year ago. It was diagnosed as vocal-cord cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In July, in an endoscopic procedure, Zeitels used a laser to
remove cancerous tissue from Glassett's right vocal cord. In
October, because vocal muscle was also removed, Zeitels built up
the cord with fat removed from Glassett's armpit. In a third
surgery, Zeitels made an incision in Glassett's neck and implanted
two synthetic wedges to move the vocal cords together so they could
vibrate and produce speech.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with Glassett under local anesthesia, Zeitels was able to
adjust the pitch of his patient's voice by having him talk, just
like a musician tuning a violin.
</P>
<P>
   James Walton, 65, whose Chelsea firm is doing the vacuum
drilling on the Big Dig, said he got throat cancer ``from 35 years
of smoking cigars. I didn't inhale,'' he said, ``but the juices and
smoke caused my problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeitels removed the cancer from the base of Walton's tongue by
using a procedure he designed nine years ago. ``Instead of using
the standard technique, which splits the jawbone,'' Zeitels said
``it involved making an incision in the front of the neck which
does not violate the oral cavity. As a result, Mr. Walton had no
neurological deficit, swallowing problems, or voice change. Nor did
he need a tracheotomy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's a miracle worker,'' Walton said. Though many of his
patients feel the same about him, Zeitels is slightly uneasy with
the description. ``It isn't faith healing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Caroyln Wood, 53, came from Kansas City., Mo., to see
if Zeitels could wake her from ``the nightmare'' she has lived for
three years. ``I had wrist surgery in Kansas City,'' Wood said
hoarsely, ``and when the anesthesiologist intubated me, he tore my
trachea.''
</P>
<P>
   She came to Boston where, she said, a surgeon at Mass. General
repaired her trachea. ``For about six months, I had to live with a
tube inserted in my throat that went up through my vocal cords. But
it scarred them, making a big hole where the two come together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Wood said, ``Dr. Zeitels removed some fat from my
shoulder, pulverized it, sucked it up with a syringe, and injected
it into my right vocal cord to fill in the hole. But,'' she said,
``another procedure is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of Zeitels's medical mentors recalled that signs of his
commitment were already evident when he was studying at the Boston
University School of Medicine. ``Steve had total career commitment
and is driven, happily so,'' said Dr. M. Stuart Strong, Zeitels's
BU adviser. ``Golf would be a very bad game for Steve because it
takes too long.''
</P>
<P>
   At BU, Zeitels was enrolled in its six-year medical program and
got his medical degree in 1982. ``Those students were the cream of
the crop,'' Strong said. ``Steve was among the few at the top of
them, always brilliant, full of questions and great with patients
who were scared.''
</P>
<P>
   After BU, Zeitels was a fellow in Strong's department there and,
after training at Boston hospitals, Zeitels worked with Strong
again at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Zeitels chuckles at his description as, ``happily driven.''
``There are still many unsolved questions,'' he said, ``and I have
a great curiosity regarding human voice production. The spectrum of
human voice is like a fingerprint and people who can't communicate
are often very unhappy. To regain someone's voice is gratifying
both to the patient and the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   He was, he conceded, so fully occupied with his work that it has
made it impossible to pursue hobbies or sports. He is unmarried,
but there is a woman in his life. Right now, he is writing a
history book about laryngology and preparing an atlas on surgical
procedures from some 25,000 slides, showing the instruments in
place.
</P>
<P>
   He will continue, he said, to look for better ways to operate
and better instruments to use. Just recently, he got a US
government patent for a universal modular glottiscope he invented,
a form of laryngoscope, that is inserted into a patient's throat
during surgery. He said it will not only give ``wider exposure'' to
the surgeon, but be more comfortable for the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in New Rochelle, N.Y., Zeitels said he always wanted
to be a doctor. ``My older brother, now a plastic surgeon,
convinced me do to surgery because I was always good with my
hands.'' Before retiring, his mother taught school in the Bronx and
his father was an orthodontist.
</P>
<P>
   Zeitels said the passion he had for crafting items out of
leather as a child helped him develop ambidexterity and precision
that have enhanced his surgery. ``Steve's hands are so steady,''
observed Dr. Tuan Nghiem, an anesthesiologist who works in surgery
with him. ``It's amazing to watch him removing lesions the size of
a sesame seed with long instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, to promote the study of laryngology, Zeitels
started a Harvard Medical School fellowship at the infirmary; now
there is competition among young doctors to be chosen for it.
``There aren't that many people in the country practicing
laryngology with the same perfection as Dr. Zeitels,'' said Dr.
Rosemary Desloge, the current fellow. But, it is Zeitels's
patients, like Jesus Lopez and South Boston's Wacko Hurley, who pay
him the most touching tributes.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley, who organizes the St. Patrick's Day parade, said he lost
his voice after being treated elsewhere for a blocked carotid
artery and that ``Dr. Zeitels got it back for me. I love the guy,''
Hurley said. ``He's a shining star in medicine. I want him on a
float in the parade, but he told me he's too busy to attend.''

LEAKS APLENTY PRECEDED LEWINSKY INTERVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not since presidential attorney David Kendall denounced
independent counsel Kenneth Starr for feeding damaging information
to the media has the Monica Lewinsky scandal been so awash in
leaks.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading to the Lewinsky interview with ABC's Barbara
Walters, excerpts of that taped conversation began showing up in
news accounts like salacious bits of the Starr report. Even as ABC
officials cried foul, it's possible that the steady drip of tidbits
could boost ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The first breach occurred last Thursday when Washington Post
media critic Howard Kurtz, citing ``a source who was present during
the (Feb. 20) interview,'' reported that Lewinsky apologizes to the
country in her chat with Walters. Much more disturbing, from ABC's
perspective, was the (N.Y.) Daily News's scoop on Tuesday when it
obtained an ``unedited audio tape'' of part of the interview and
reported that Lewinsky apologizes to Hillary and Chelsea Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as two separate situations,'' said an ABC
spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy. ``We are convinced the Howard Kurtz
leak came from somewhere else than ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's wise for me to characterize my source in
any way other than to say that the information seems to be right on
target,'' Kurtz responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Daily News was more of a concern to us because that was
someone who stole our property,'' added Murphy. ``If we find out
with certainty where it came from, we are considering legal
action.'' Daily News senior managing editor Arthur Browne said the
tape was delivered anonymously to the Daily News and ``we have no
idea who gave it to us,'' adding that the paper was careful not to
infringe on ABC's copyright.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News and Post leaks were not ``something we devised
strategically,'' insisted Murphy, who had heard the speculation
that the leaks were part of an ABC plan to build ratings. In recent
days, the network had been busy parceling out pieces of the
interview, starting with a Walters telephone press conference Feb.
22 and including the airing of a clip on Wednesday's ``Good Morning
America'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the supersonic world of Monicagate, the Walters
interview was already becoming old news by the time it aired.
Wednesday's big revelation was that in her upcoming book,
``Monica's Story,'' Lewinsky is harshly critical of her treatment
by Starr and his deputies.

HAPPY IN MANANA'S EMBRACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a week in Mexico, I've decided the world is divided into
two kinds of people: those who feel they must control their
environment and those who don't. I've known some Mexicans who fit
into the first category. I'm still searching for a US tourist who
fits into the second.
</P>
<P>
   There was a good reason our family vacationed for the second
year at Costa Azul, a small ``adventure'' resort in a small town an
hour's drive from Puerto Vallarta. We wanted to have others take
care of us, including the grandchildren. After all, we assumed sole
responsibility for getting ourselves to the open-air dining area on
the beach when we craved a fruit smoothie. If we chose to do more
than watch the waves crash on our deserted stretch of ocean where
the undertow was too powerful for swimming, we had to decide
whether to take a dip in the pool or walk all the way to a
sheltered cove at the end of the beach.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed only fair that if we wanted the adventures that
came with our package _ a kayak trip to an island off Rincon, a
horseback ride though the jungle above the resort, a 3-mile hike to
a hidden waterfall at Yelapa, a sail to a snorkeling spot called
Los Arcos, or a visit to an alligator farm in San Blas _ the people
in charge should make all the arrangements, including
transportation, food, and guides.
</P>
<P>
   They did, too. Only this being Mexico, they did it their way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on the way to Rincon, the kayak trailer blew a
tire. Feeling lucky the trailer didn't flip, taking our van with
it, we agreed that one guide would seek a replacement for the tire
while the rest of us went on with the other guide to Rincon. There
we rented a small boat to take us to the bird sanctuary in the
middle of the bay.
</P>
<P>
   The boat owner assured us he'd be with us in ``un momentito.''
Back at Costa Azul, ``un momento'' translated into half an hour and
a ``momentito'' generally meant half that. We efficiency-possessed
Americanos fidgeted like crazy, tormented by our own helplessness.
It was unbearable to stand around for 40 minutes watching a man
just offshore bail out a boat full of water with a small tin can.
</P>
<P>
   Within a day of arrival, we'd faced every American's nightmare:
a situation in which there was nothing to do but let go and relax.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, we set off for Yelapa, a small beach town
accessible only by boat. After a snack, we headed inland, stepping
over boulders, wading through rivers, avoiding the piles of manure
left behind by the burros and horses that transported
``nonadventure'' tourists to the waterfall. A group of us stopped
at a lovely secluded rock pool for a swim. The more daring climbed
a rift in an extremely steep cliff to reach the waterfall itself.
</P>
<P>
   I was summoning my courage to go behind the thundering curtain
of water when my daughter Julie shouted, ``Mom, Dad's been stung.''
The last time Jack was bitten, a hornet entered his mouth on a
chicken leg and he ended up in the hospital, gasping for breath.
This time Jack disturbed a nest of hornets and was bitten four
times before scrambling back down the cliff. Luckily, an American
had packed antihistamines for just such an event so that Jack
suffered no serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, the horse one daughter was to have ridden threw a
shoe. The boat for the sailing trip was damaged, adding three hours
to an already long trip. Though the surfers were thrilled, the huge
waves meant no more kayak trips. Nothing started on time. Meals
took forever to arrive. Stray dogs wandered in and out of the
eating area. On Friday night, a garlanded burro arrived with the
mariachi band and pooped right in the middle of the dining area
with a great flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans protested. ``You can call me an ugly American,
but I won't get onto this boat unless every member of my family has
a life preserver!'' Some commiserated with one another. ``OK, what
went wrong on your trip?'' Most adapted. ``Have another cup of
coffee. We won't be leaving for a while.'' Actually, our family
thrived.
</P>
<P>
   We kayaked in the pool. We walked nowhere special and always
found something extraordinary. We built sand castles. We chased
crabs and observed iguanas. We watched the sun set. We kidded
around. We whiled away untold, blissful, nonproductive,
nonpurposeful hours.
</P>
<P>
   No efficiency. No stress. No expectations. No pressure. No
appointments. No disappointments. No schedules. No lists. No
errands. No phone calls. No news. No anxiety. No headaches. No
insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all. No complaints.

BRACKETS WILL SILENCE SQUEAKY FLOORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I misplaced an article you had about elminating squeaky
floors. It showed a picture of an aluminum brace that is inserted
under the floor against a joist. Where can I find them?
</P>
<P>
   FRED Z., Dover, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try the Improvements catalog, 800-642-2112. The bracket is
called Squeak Relief, item number 105064, four for $14.99,
including screws. The bracket is inserted on a joist where it meets
the floor above, and screws are driven into the joist and the
floor, keeping it from moving; when the floor does not move, it
will not squeak.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I get a print of The Wall Street Journal off a white
leather chair? I bought a leather cleaner that didn't work. Neither
did vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   KIM MURRAY, Sudbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try Spray and Wash, which takes newspaper print off Formica.
Try it in an obscure area to make sure it does not affect the
leather adversely. Because leather is leather, you have to be extra
careful cleaning and caring for it.
</P>
<P>
   Or, try Apple Leather Care by Apple Polishers, Box 43, Stow, MA
01775; telephone 978-897-6569 or 800-322-6569. Their products
include Garde, which keeps suede, Nubuck, leather, and fabrics
water repellent and stain resistant; Creme Polish, which brings
dull, cracked leather back to life; and Leather Cleaner, an
aggressive cleaner designed to safely clean finished leather.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do those ultrasound machines I see widely advertised actually
scare mice away? Are they any good?
</P>
<P>
   PLAGUED BY RODENTS
</P>
<P>
   A. Here is what the authors of ``Common-Sense Pest Control''
say: There are no studies indicating that ultrasound devices are
effective at significantly reducing or eliminating rats or other
rodents from an area. There are reports showing that certain types
are helpful when used in combination with other methods, but this
still does not mean they will eliminate an infestation.
</P>
<P>
   If you see one mouse, you probably have 20. The standard
treatment is to use D-Con, but keep it away from pets, kids, and
other critters. And if you have a cat, do not use D-Con, because
mice killed by D-Con and eaten by kitty could kill the cat, too.
</P>
<P>
   Or, use the tried-and-true method of traps. Any kind of trap is
effective, but the snap traps are still probably the best. Place
them in the basement, behind the stove, and where you think the
mice are running. They usually run along a wall, so traps set near
a wall are most effective.
</P>
<P>
   Another deterrent is a little harder. Close all openings in the
foundation and anywhere else you may find them; remember, mice can
go through a hole the size of a dime, and they are also good
climbers. Fill holes and big cracks in the foundation with mortar,
and stuff other holes with Stuffit, a nonrusting brass or copper
``steel'' wool. You can buy Stuffit by calling Creative Expressions
at 316-788-6290.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have an old poured floor, of the type in which liquid vinyl
is poured on the floor, allowed to set, then embedded with colorful
chips. It is all brown and ugly. How can I remove it?
</P>
<P>
   GINGER WINSLOW, Hingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Scrape the floor with brute force, although adding a litle
heat might make it easier to scrape. Use a hair dryer, not a
hot-air gun; the latter is much too hot to use indoors. You can
rent a power scraper, which will hasten the chore, from a rental
store. But it is still hard work. Poured floors were developed in
the 1970s, but never really caught on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a blockage in my sewer line in the basement; the
dishwasher backed up through the cleanout in the basement pipeline.
How can I unblock it?
</P>
<P>
   CAROLYN, Winchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You might be able to loosen the debris by inserting a snake
into the line through the cleanout; then send a lot of water down
the line to float the debris further down, hoping that the blockage
will continue to break up. The ony other recourse is to call good
old Roto-Rooter, which claims to be able to cut through any
blockage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My rubber roof was installed three years ago. One of the
seams has lifted and is leaking, enough so that water runs through
a light fixture. How can I fix it? I have called the roofer without
success.
</P>
<P>
   ROB JOHN, Beverly, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. While a roof is usually warranted by the roofer for only a
year, I think he is still responsible, or should be, to fix the
leak. I suggest you cover the leak with a tarp, but don't touch the
seam; the tarp will at least prevent most water from coming in.
Have your lawyer write a nice letter to the roofer; and the roofer
should get the message. If that fails, have another roofer fix the
leak, if you can find one willing to do someone else's work.

MONICA'S MESSAGE WINS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Turns out the Beltway babblers underestimated her, and
so did the rest of us. After 15 months of constant media coverage,
thousands of pages of depositions, X-rated diaries, taped telephone
conversations and a strategically unlaundered blue dress, we
figured the only meaningful revelation to emerge from the Monica
Lewinsky saga had to do with the significance of dry cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   But, no.
</P>
<P>
   What Monica Lewinsky has demonstrated most clearly is the
complete insignificance of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at what happened Wednesday in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day the ABC television network scheduled Barbara
Walters' two-hour interview with Monica, Arizona scheduled the
execution of murderer Walter LaGrand.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of LaGrand was to follow the execution last week of
his half brother, Karl, the two of them convicted of the 1982
murder of bank manager Kenneth Hartsock and attempted murder of
teller Dawn Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were born in Bavaria to a German mother and
separate U.S. Army fathers. Over the past month or so, German
officials ranging from its ambassador to its chancellor have asked
Arizona officials to cancel or at least postpone the executions.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Dee Hull turned them down, saying Tuesday, ``In the
interest of justice and with the victims in mind, I have decided to
allow this execution to go forward as scheduled.'' &QL; 
GIRL TALKING, MAN DYING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LaGrand died an ugly suffocating death in the state gas chamber
about the same time Monica told Barbara on TV that Bill Clinton is
``a very sensual man who has a lot of sensual feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the two events _ the man dying or the girl talking _ which do
you figure was more eagerly anticipated by the general public?
</P>
<P>
   Which was more interesting?
</P>
<P>
   Which are they talking about now around the water cooler?
</P>
<P>
   For this I believe we must say, ``Thank you, Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   We live in a place and at a time in which croaking a guy isn't
nearly as interesting as watching a 25-year-old former intern
declare, ``From the beginning there was a very intense sexual
attraction (between her and Clinton), and I don't necessarily think
a sexual attraction is a bad thing. I didn't feel that way _ and I
still don't.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Walter LaGrand told a state clemency board, ``No
one, me, Karl, anyone, has the right to take another life and that
includes the state of Arizona and the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   He's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The state has the right to kill a murderer if it wants to. In
fact, Arizona started killing criminals back in 1873, and didn't
stop until the 1960s, when the U.S. Supreme Court stopped us. We
started up again in 1992 with the execution of murderer Donald
Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Since then we've executed 15 guys, more or less. I'm guessing
there's not a person in the state who knows exactly how many, or
anyone (besides victim families) who could name them. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BESTSELLER IN THE MAKING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But we know all about Ms. Lewinsky, and want to know even more,
which is why the book about her, ``Monica's Story,'' is about to
hit the bestseller list.
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of execution is to send society a message about
justice, accountability, revenge. And, now that we've executed a
bunch of bad guys, the message seems pretty clear:
</P>
<P>
   Killing doesn't mean much.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that's not exactly what we had hoped to get across
to the punks on the street.
</P>
<P>
   LaGrand's lawyers were able to delay his scheduled afternoon
execution. But not for long.
</P>
<P>
   He died Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most stringent supporters of the death penalty must be
upset with that development.
</P>
<P>
   They have no problem with execution. But killing Walter before
he had a chance to watch Barbara's interview with Monica, that was
cruel and unusual. &QL;

BERKSHIRE MUSEUM'S TOY EXHIBIT IS A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: With KIDS-MUSEUM-QUIZ)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSFIELD, Mass. _ There is an antidote to the velvet-roped,
don't-touch, guard-scowling, no-talking, no-running, no-singing,
no-dancing, no-throwing, no-laughing, no-fun museum experience.
</P>
<P>
   No fooling. In fact, there is a museum where kids are welcome,
yelling is allowed, throwing is encouraged and scurrying feet
across hardwood floors is accepted. And those are the parents.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkshire Museum, home to fine art and sculptures and hermit
crabs and snakes, is now exhibiting childhood memories. It is a
hands-on trip down years past where today's kids can start making
their own fond remembrances. And adults can relive theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wild. I am in my glory,'' said Joanna Navone, 35, of
West Springfield, Mass. ``I brought my kids to play here, and I'm
having more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a sound of perpetual squealing and motion, except for
the adults who plop in chairs in front of a television (with a
covering to make it look like a monstrous old Philco set) that
plays loops of classic toy commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The toys themselves, well, you've heard of them before. If there
were a toy hall of fame, they would be the Ruths and DiMaggios and
Aarons: The Duncan Yo-Yo. Frisbee. Hot Wheels. Colorforms. Barbie.
G.I. Joe. Erector set. Lego. Lincoln logs. Silly Putty. Slinky.
Magic ``8'' Ball. Play-Doh. View-Master. Flexible Flyer (the sled).
Radio Flyer (the red steel wagon). Matchbox cars. Pez. The
Easy-Bake Oven. And more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Easy-Bake Oven in turquoise is the '60s dream kitchen,''
sighed Sharon Wolf, 41, of Saddle River, N.J., as she looked at
just such a model. ``They made a yellow one, but it had to be
turquoise.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4,500-square-foot exhibit, which runs through May 30 (before
going on a nationwide tour), not only displays the toys of the
1930s to 1960s that remain in production, but also the even more
nostalgic advertising that went with them.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be shocked at just how stupid the ``Slinky'' theme song
is. Then again, you will also be singing it the whole way home.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Cabbage Patch dolls, or Teletubbies, or Beanie
Babies. To make the cut for this exhibit, the toys had to remain
popular through at least several generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are toys that have become icons in today's society,''
said Amy G. Burger, the museum's assistant director of marketing.
``They have stood the test of time. We played with them. Our
parents played with them. Our kids played with them. Our kids' kids
will probably play with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as striking as seeing some of these toys again are the
stories behind them. For example, two of the most resilient toys on
the market were created as a result of World War II _ and by
accident.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, Richard James was an engineer in the Cramp Shipyard in
Philadelphia, charged with the responsibility of creating a
mechanism for measuring horsepower on a battleship. One day he
dropped an inner spring to the apparatus he was working on. The
spring hopped across the floor.
</P>
<P>
   What a wonderful, wonderful toy. For wonderful girls and boys.
</P>
<P>
   The Slinky was born. Although James left his family in 1960 to
join a cult in Bolivia (not mentioned in the exhibit), Slinky
remains in production today (forget the plastic ones; stick to
metal), with alternative uses ranging from gutter protectors to
pigeon repellers to makeshift antennas popular among the troops
during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time the Slinky was invented, James Wright was
working in a New Haven, Conn., lab for the General Electric Co.,
trying to find a synthetic substitute for rubber, since America's
supply to the vital component in the Far East was cut off by the
Japanese. He mixed boric acid with silicone oil, with lousy
results.
</P>
<P>
   But the stuff did bounce high. And it could clean typewriter
keys, remove lint, strengthen wrists during exercise and serve as
makeshift earplugs. For some reason, it could also lift print off a
newspaper. It was putty. It was silly. And Silly Putty remains with
us long after the war ended.
</P>
<P>
   Although some toys can be played in the solitude of a child's
room, many were made to be shared (one-person Wiffle Ball is pretty
boring). And many toys like Erector sets required dexterity and
thought _ developmental motion _ rather than merely steady eyes
glued to a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought me back, good memories of childhood,'' said Joe
Testa, 47, of Dalton, Mass., ``when there was more imagination,
more interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Toys that required you to run and laugh and squeal, and no
velvet ropes were required. No fooling.
</P>

<P>
   PITTSFIELD, Mass. _ You know the toys and games of your youth.
You remember them better than what you had for breakfast. But let's
see how much you know about the background of your childhood
playthings. Take this test from the Berkshire Museum.
</P>
<P>
   1. This game was originally rejected in 1934 because it had ``52
fundamental errors.''
</P>
<P>
   2. This product initially crashed in the 1950s under the cosmic
name ``Pluto Platters,'' but soared when the original unofficial
nickname of its unmarketed 1920s predecessor was restored.
</P>
<P>
   3. Architect John Lloyd Wright, the son of famed architect Frank
Lloyd Wright, came up with the idea for this toy based on his
father's 1916 design of Tokyo's Imperial Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   4. The name of this toy comes from ``leg godt,'' Danish for
``play well.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Johnny Gruelle came up with the concept for this toy in 1906,
after his daughter found an old, tattered doll in her grandmother's
attic.

<P>
   6. This toy actually was first used as a weapon centuries ago in
the Philippines; its name means ``come back'' in Tagalog, a native
language.
</P>
<P>
   7. Safety concerns prompted changes in 1964 in this toy that
initially required the use of fruit and/or vegetables.
</P>

U.S. DRUG WAR SHOULD FOCUS MORE ON DEMAND  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE MARCH 4 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
 WAR-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Critics of the annual certification of Mexico as a
partner in fighting illegal drugs are right to decry the
presidential decree as a ``sham'' and a ``whitewash'' by the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   It is. And it's a shame a federal law makes us do it every year.
</P>
<P>
   More shameful, however, is our own tepid acknowledgement of the
real problem in battling illegal drug use. With a seemingly
insatiable appetite for poison, Americans are the greatest enemy in
this national fight.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing _ not a mirror held to our stoned faces, not the
burden of hypocrisy _ stops the words and deeds that annually
jeopardize the mutually beneficial relationship between the nation
and our dear neighbors to the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my way,'' U.S. Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., said
this week as decertification legislation was introduced, ``I'd stop
every truck coming across the border and unload it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now isn't that a terrific way to promote trade and goodwill
between the two countries?
</P>
<P>
   Shaw believes the United States should take unilateral action
against Mexico and impose stiffer sanctions against one of our
strongest economic and political allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These weapons of mass destruction (drugs) are killing
Americans,'' Shaw said, offering up his argument to treat Mexico as
we treat Iraq. ``These weapons of mass destruction are contributing
to growing crime in America.''
</P>
<P>
   But these ``weapons'' are harmless unless put to use by millions
of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico can be blamed for making it too easy for drug traffickers
to do business in the United States. About 60 percent of the
cocaine and half the methamphetamine and marijuana that is smuggled
into the United States comes across the 2,000-mile U.S-Mexico
border.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government lacks the resources and at times the
unimpugned leadership to fight well-armed, well-endowed drug
cartels. Clinton administration officials acknowledged last week
that corruption in Mexico seems to be at an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico cannot be blamed for drug habits in the United
States. Americans snort, pop, smoke and shoot about $50 billion
worth of illegal drugs every year.
</P>
<P>
   It makes little sense to impose economic sanctions against a
struggling neighbor whose healthy future is vital to the interests
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is cooperating with us in the battle for our lives,''
President Clinton said in announcing his decision to renew
certification. ``(President Ernesto Zedillo) cannot win this battle
alone. And neither can we.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the nation has tried to prevent dope from reaching
our borders. Emphasis on reducing demand only now is getting some
of the attention it deserves in our national plans. The White House
Office of Drug Policy is directing more money in its $17.1 billion
budget for prevention and treatment. A major ad campaign is the
most visible sign of the goal to reduce demand.
</P>
<P>
   But the emphasis on interdiction continues.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has a new $400 million battle plan to fight drug
traffickers by land, air and sea. It won't be effective without a
strong plan in the United States that targets the hearts, heads and
bloodstreams of millions of Americans. &QL;

MONICA'S MESSAGE WINS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Turns out the Beltway babblers underestimated her, and
so did the rest of us. After 15 months of constant media coverage,
thousands of pages of depositions, X-rated diaries, taped telephone
conversations and a strategically unlaundered blue dress, we
figured the only meaningful revelation to emerge from the Monica
Lewinsky saga had to do with the significance of dry cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   But, no.
</P>
<P>
   What Monica Lewinsky has demonstrated most clearly is the
complete insignificance of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at what happened Wednesday in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day the ABC television network scheduled Barbara
Walters' two-hour interview with Monica, Arizona scheduled the
execution of murderer Walter LaGrand.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of LaGrand was to follow the execution last week of
his half brother, Karl, the two of them convicted of the 1982
murder of bank manager Kenneth Hartsock and attempted murder of
teller Dawn Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were born in Bavaria to a German mother and
separate U.S. Army fathers. Over the past month or so, German
officials ranging from its ambassador to its chancellor have asked
Arizona officials to cancel or at least postpone the executions.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Dee Hull turned them down, saying Tuesday, ``In the
interest of justice and with the victims in mind, I have decided to
allow this execution to go forward as scheduled.'' &QL; 
GIRL TALKING, MAN DYING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LaGrand died an ugly suffocating death in the state gas chamber
about the same time Monica told Barbara on TV that Bill Clinton is
``a very sensual man who has a lot of sensual feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the two events _ the man dying or the girl talking _ which do
you figure was more eagerly anticipated by the general public?
</P>
<P>
   Which was more interesting?
</P>
<P>
   Which are they talking about now around the water cooler?
</P>
<P>
   For this I believe we must say, ``Thank you, Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   We live in a place and at a time in which croaking a guy isn't
nearly as interesting as watching a 25-year-old former intern
declare, ``From the beginning there was a very intense sexual
attraction (between her and Clinton), and I don't necessarily think
a sexual attraction is a bad thing. I didn't feel that way _ and I
still don't.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Walter LaGrand told a state clemency board, ``No
one, me, Karl, anyone, has the right to take another life and that
includes the state of Arizona and the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   He's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The state has the right to kill a murderer if it wants to. In
fact, Arizona started killing criminals back in 1873, and didn't
stop until the 1960s, when the U.S. Supreme Court stopped us. We
started up again in 1992 with the execution of murderer Donald
Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Since then we've executed 15 guys, more or less. I'm guessing
there's not a person in the state who knows exactly how many, or
anyone (besides victim families) who could name them. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BESTSELLER IN THE MAKING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But we know all about Ms. Lewinsky, and want to know even more,
which is why the book about her, ``Monica's Story,'' is about to
hit the bestseller list.
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of execution is to send society a message about
justice, accountability, revenge. And, now that we've executed a
bunch of bad guys, the message seems pretty clear:
</P>
<P>
   Killing doesn't mean much.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that's not exactly what we had hoped to get across
to the punks on the street.
</P>
<P>
   LaGrand's lawyers were able to delay his scheduled afternoon
execution. But not for long.
</P>
<P>
   He died Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most stringent supporters of the death penalty must be
upset with that development.
</P>
<P>
   They have no problem with execution. But killing Walter before
he had a chance to watch Barbara's interview with Monica, that was
cruel and unusual. &QL;

<P>
   BUDAI, Lebanon _ The farmers in the fertile Bekaa Valley
longingly recall the good ol' days, when lush fields of hashish and
opium provided for BMWs, chic leather jackets and schooling for
their children at prestigious American universities.
</P>
<P>
   That came to an end in the early 1990s. With pressure and help
from the United States, Lebanese army tractors plowed up the crops
and soldiers enforced tough anti-drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released this week(CQ), the U.S. State Department
praised the near-total elimination of drug crops in the Bekaa
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But, the victory for America's war on drugs is also a public
relations triumph for the anti-American Hezbollah, which has come
to the aid of farmers while international bureaucracies struggle to
provide alternatives for drug farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hezbollah is the answer,'' says Mohammad Shammas, a
48-year-old farmer who used to grow hashish and now raises
chickens. Sitting in a house that is large but rundown, he ticks
off the benefits of Hezbollah: ``They pay money. They build
schools. They do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Hezbollah is not the only group trying to help the
farmers. But, the centerpiece effort, by the United Nations, has
had only mixed results. A U.S. program shows potential, but is
still new, and the Lebanese government has done little. Meanwhile,
Hezbollah, has been able to play Robin Hood against the perceived
injustices of the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could argue that (the drug) program ended the empire of
hashish,'' said Nizar Hamzeh, an expert on Hezbollah at the
American University in Beirut. ``(But) the consequence was
basically boosting the image of Hezbollah . . . These people are
really depending on Hezbollah aid.''
</P>
<P>
   The chaos of the 16-year Lebanese civil war, ending in 1991,
allowed farmers in this large plain near the Syrian border to
openly cultivate drugs for export to Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that as many as 65,000 farms were
involved. Farmers say hashish is no more dangerous than alcohol,
and they deny responsibility for what was done with the opium. They
claim they were promised help by their government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they were going to pay us something for what we
lost, but they didn't,'' says farmer Ali Salwan, 64, who has sold a
car, carpets and appliances since he gave up hashish farming. He
says he now grows wheat at barely 15 percent the price of cannabis.
</P>
<P>
   The Bekaa is now one of the poorest areas of Lebanon. Houses are
sparsely-furnished and dilapidated. The poverty is not at the level
of some African or Latin American nations, but drinking water is in
short supply, youth are moving to the crowded cities and per capita
income is around $1,700 a year.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed ``Party of
God,'' has been strong in the region and has used it to base
training camps for guerrillas fighting Israel's 17-year-occupation
of southern Lebanon. At night, Hezbollah recruits can be seen
goose-stepping along the narrow country roads.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah became infamous in the 1980s, when it was blamed for a
series of kidnappings. The U.S. government considers it a terrorist
organization. In the last two weeks, it has displayed its
battlefield skill by killing seven Israelis, including a brigadier
general.
</P>
<P>
   But, it is also a political party in the Lebanese parliament and
a social network that builds schools and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The party subsidizes poor families with $200 to $500 a month and
gives money for tractors, fertilizers and even irrigation systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hezbollah is against drugs and our (Muslim) religion is
against drugs,'' says Hezbollah Sheikh Nabil Kaouk. ``(But)
supporting people in the Bekaa comes from our belief in helping the
poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary need for the valley is water. Most legal crops need
more water than hashish. The farmers also need loans, healthcare,
access to markets and expertise for crops they may not have grown
before.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department narcotics report said the UN's program to
address those needs has spent its money ``inefficiently,'' and UN
officials acknowledge they have not raised half the $50 million
needed for the valley.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the U.S. Agency for International Development, or
USAID, began a five-year project aimed at helping rural communities
throughout Lebanon. The Bekaa portion has spent about $2.2 million
in 74 villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there are a number of issues with availability of
water, marketing of new crops, viability of new crops,'' said
Lebanon USAID mission director James Stephenson. ``This takes time.
There is no quick fix. (But) I would be optimistic that those
problems can be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The USAID program is new, but it uses contributions from the
farmers themselves and expertise from the American University in
Beirut. Providing skills and markets, it could promise a better
future than Hezbollah's subsidy approach.
</P>
<P>
   That, ultimately, might be fine with Hezbollah. Analyst Hamzeh
said the Bekaa work stretches the party's budget. Sheikh Kaouk
acknowledges, ``financially, we are limited. There are other places
we need to spend.''

   XIAMEN, China _ King Michael of Dell is capturing territory in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the converted avionics plant where Dell Computer Corp.
builds computers for Chinese customers, optimism is bursting like
sunrise over the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how fast Dell grew in Europe in the early '90s? ``We
will do the same thing in China -- absolutely no doubt about it,''
says Irishman Buddy Griffin, who has moved on from Dell's European
operations to oversee the start-up of the newest Dell factory here.
</P>
<P>
   Across the big open workfloor from Griffin's office, the Dell
sales manager has erected a Chinese gong. Whenever a salesperson
clinches a major order -- say 20 or 30 computers -- the sales
manager bangs on it with a wooden rod.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the gong will be sounding more often, or so the
company is expecting. Dell China president David Chan predicts that
annual sales revenues in China will double in 1999, and then double
again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in Austin (Texas), the guys know what we are doing
here,'' said Chan, a former IBM marketing executive. ``Michael
knows what we've been doing on a month-to-month basis, because he
sees the results. He's very happy with the progress we've made to
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dell echoed Chan's sentiments saying that the China
operation's progress has been ``very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite impressive to see them kind of knocking down
milestones in terms of quality, order run rates, and capacity,''
the Dell chairman added.
</P>
<P>
   Already China ranks as the world's fifth-largest market for
personal computers, with about 4 million computers sold last year,
compared to 8 million in Japan and 36 million in the United States.
With personal computer sales in China growing at 27 percent a year,
China is projected to surpass Japan and become the world's
third-biggest computer market by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As a latecomer to China, Dell ranks only 11th in computer sales
on the Chinese mainland. It lags well behind the entrenched
American multinationals IBM, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard, and even
further behind Legend, China's fast-growing, state-owned computer
maker.
</P>
<P>
   But Dell's results for the last four months show signs of moving
up. For the first time, one percent of personal computers sold in
China were Dells, according to International Data Corp.'s
preliminary findings for the last three months of 1998. And in
January, Dell notched probably it's strongest month so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our take on it is that Dell is going to grow relatively
quickly in China,'' said Dane Anderson, an analyst at
Connecticut-based IDC. ``They had a relatively strong performance
in the fourth quarter. I think they certainly will break into the
top 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's workforce in China has jumped from 200 to 330 in the last
six months, and is projected to keep expanding past 500 by later
this year
</P>
<P>
   On the top floor of the five-story, blue-and-white Dell building
here, the phones are ringing. Since October, calls to Dell's
technical help lines have doubled as more customers break in their
new Dells.
</P>
<P>
   Already, new help-line technicians and order-processors are
showing up for work, and the top floor is running out of desk
space. The telephone sales crew is about to move to the vacant
fourth floor. And with no time to spare: the crew is expanding from
30 to 50 in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Down on the second floor, the computer-manufacturing team grew
from 36 to 54, just recently.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dell is the first computer manufacturer in Xiamen, almost
none of the assemblers had seen the inside of a personal computer
before they were hired.
</P>
<P>
   Dell picked them on the strength of experience in assembling
electronic parts in other Chinese factories. Now, five days a week,
they are turning out and testing Dell-brand notebooks, desktops and
servers that the company says are virtually identical to those made
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   After about a year of market surveys and other intelligence
gathering, Dell launched its assault on China early last year.
That's when a landing party of executives from Dell's Singapore
office navigated China's bureaucratic reefs and won permission to
start a 100-percent, Dell-owned computer factory here.
</P>
<P>
   As of February 1998, Dell was on the verge of locating in the
hurly-burly of China's biggest city, Shanghai. But then the mayor
of this quaint old port city, one-tenth the size of Shanghai,
approached Dell with an unbeatable, still nonpublicized package of
tax and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Delighted with its reception in Xiamen, Dell announced a year
ago this month that it would open a sales, manufacturing and
service center here. But three weeks later, China's central
government threw the entire project into limbo by suddenly ordering
all companies to cease ``direct selling'' in order to prevent
``social chaos'' throughout China
</P>
<P>
   Although the order mainly targeted alleged ``pyramid sales''
schemes by Chinese and Taiwanese hucksters, the language was broad
enough to cripple the China operations of Avon Products Inc. and
several other blue-chip international companies engaged in direct
selling.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, Dell's ``direct selling'' strategy could be viewed by
the Chinese as akin to the legendary Avon Lady's tactics in selling
lipstick door-to-door, outside normal commercial venues. But after
a few days of worried consultations with Chinese authorities, the
Dell advance party concluded that its own direct selling strategy
was not jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   By last May, Dell resolved to push ahead. In what must be record
time, Griffin's team of five expatriates recruited and trained a
200-member Chinese crew -- everyone from computer assemblers to
salespeople to telephone help-line technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Last August 20, Dell started the assembly line. The early
products were clustered at the most expensive, high-tech end of
Dell's computer line: Optiplex desktops, Latitude notebooks and
even Poweredge servers.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, Dell's foreign legion could find almost no Chinese
customers ready to buy Dell computers. Michael Dell's vaunted
worldwide ``model'' of selling computers directly to the customer
didn't seem to catch on in China.
</P>
<P>
   Not at first, anyway. For the first month Dell was running the
factory, it had to rely almost entirely on sales to China-based
American multinationals that purchase Dell equipment for all their
worldwide offices through their ``global accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's market share in China actually sank lower than the
previous year during the first month the factory was operating,
according to IDC. In cold numbers, Dell had done better when it was
still exporting computers from abroad, and selling them through
Chinese vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Chan, one of the sparkplugs of direct-selling in Dell's
Singapore headquarters, was named president of Dell China last
October and took on the responsibility as Dell's bilingual
salesman-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   As if by magic, the tide began turning about the time Chan took
on the assignment. By the time Michael Dell arrived last November
to commemorate the opening of his Xiamen factory, Chan's
salespeople were clinching orders from provincial
telecommunications companies and banks.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   One early customer was the state-owned Xinhua news agency, which
bought personal computers for its Beijing and Guangzhou offices.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Jan. 13, Dell locked up what was probably its biggest
China order so far -- 265 of the company's newest-model servers,
the entry-level Poweredge-1300. They were bought by one of
Beijing's increasingly technology-conscious government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sale that demonstrated Dell's strengths, and its
weaknesses, in China.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dell's China sales have been heavily concentrated in
what the company calls ``the corporate space.'' To Chan, that means
big buyers with at least ``a few thousand employees, buying a few
hundred PCs a year.'' They could be foreign multinationals, Chinese
banks or manufacturing companies, or agencies of the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
   What gives Dell an edge in ``corporate space,'' says Chan, is
that buyers are most often looking for the latest high-end models,
powered with 400 megahertz processors or faster. And they insist on
reliable service.
</P>
<P>
   In that price range, Dell's head-to-head competitors turn out to
be the same ones it has successfully challenged in Europe -- IBM,
Compaq and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese computer makers are not really playing in the
high-end PC market that we play in -- at least not yet,'' Chan
said. ``They (Legend and other Chinese makers) are playing in the
lower-power market, selling 266 megahertz and 300 megahertz
desktops like those we used to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, our minimum desktop is 350 megahertz, and very soon
it will be 400 megahertz. Every few months we jump up a notch, so
(the Chinese and American computer makers) are not meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Dell would also like to sell computers to vast
numbers of Chinese individuals and small businesses. But it has had
only scant success so far.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, Dell has made a hard-boiled marketing judgment
that the overwhelming majority of China's 1.3 billion people are
not now potential Dell customers.
</P>
<P>
   It has meticulously pared down the theoretical mass market to
what it calls the ``addressable market size'' in China. That is
made up mainly of sophisticated urbanites and the big institutions
that employ them.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in deference to the market power of Legend and other
Chinese computer makers, Dell has avoided offering budget-priced
computers that might appeal to Chinese university students or other
first-time computer buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for Chinese looking for bargain home PCs, China-made Dells
aren't especially attractive. Dell's cheapest desktop sells here
for about $1,500, compared to about $800 for a desktop made by
Legend or other domestic manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison of the Dell websites in China and the United States
produces other examples of why Dell isn't a consumer's bargain in
China:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A typical Dell high-end Optiplex GX1p desktop sells for $3,010
in China, compared to a $2,672 pricetag on a virtually identical
GX1p model purchased through the Dell website in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A typical Dell 266-megahertz Latitude notebook costs $3,601
when purchased through the Dell website in China, compared to a
price of $2,902 when the same model with the same features is
bought through the Dell website in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   How much of China does King Michael think he can capture in the
next 10 years?
</P>
<P>
   For outsiders, perhaps the best gauge will be to watch what
happens in the next few years to a block of land five miles up the
highway from Dell's present Xiamen factory.
</P>
<P>
   At least four months before Dell opened its assembly line last
August, its executives had already reached a preliminary agreement
with Xiamen city authorities for a 99-year lease on the much larger
piece of land. Dell viewed its present leased plant as a starter
factory that would handle only the first few years' growth.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Dell and its architects have laid detailed plans for
an efficient two-story factory on the larger block of land -- one
with at least twice as much workspace that would contain highly
automated assembly lines. It could theoretically manufacture
``huge'' numbers of computers, many more than the current Xiamen
factory, according to Dell's Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Xiamen city authorities are scheduled to start
preparing the land for construction of the second Dell factory.
Dell has just hired a Chinese civil engineer to seek necessary
environmental and other construction permits.
</P>
<P>
   The land for the second factory should be cleared and ready for
the start of construction as early as August. But Dell's top
management has yet to announce final approval. If sales flatten,
there could be an indefinite delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best estimate is that in two years, we'll be in there,''
says Griffin. ``It won't be less than 12 months, that's for sure.
But it could be a year and a half from now.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. Has big plans for Asia,
beginning with a major foothold in the People's Republic of China.
The hope is that Dell's formidable sales strategy of
``direct-selling'' to the computer customer will catch on with
China's large, fast-growing consumer market, mimicking the
company's success in Europe. Cox News Service correspondent Jerry
Mahoney spoke with Dell Chairman Michael Dell recently about the
China operation.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Are you happy with the progress of the China operation
to date?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: China's running nicely ahead of plans. And we've been
really thrilled with the reaction from customers so far to the
direct-sell business model. I have two trips already this year
planned to China, including a Fortune magazine global forum we're
sponsoring with a couple of other companies in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you quantify the start out of the gates in China,
compared to other new markets?
</P>
<P>
   A: We don't really break it out at that level but it's off to a
very, very nice start. This is a market that several years ago was
not in the Top 20. Now, a lot of people would say it's the
third-largest market in the world. And it looks like it could be
the second-largest market in the world in a couple of years,
overtaking Japan. It's really quite remarkable what's going on over
there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that you want to be the world's No. 1 producer of
PCs?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it would be good. I think part of it depends on what
our competitors do, what other mergers or acquisitions may occur in
the marketplace. We've been pretty clear in our statement about
saying we think we can grow faster than the market. You could kind
of plot out our current growth rate and that would suggest that in
a couple of years we start to become No. 1 in more and more
markets. But that's more of a mathematical equation than a
prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But it still is the goal of Dell to be the No. 1 PC maker in
the world at some point?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure. We wouldn't have a goal to be No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does Dell have to accomplish in China to reach that goal
eventually?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I think we're a long way away from that in China today.
We're establishing a base and building our business. Actually, our
first goal in China is that we want to be the No. 1 American
computer company in China.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Compaq is that now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And then what? What's the share there?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, the share is moving around quite a bit for all the
companies because the market is growing. And if you look at the
size of the market three years from now, it's likely to be huge
compared to what it is this year. So it's advancing quickly, but we
have very small share there today.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will China be like in five years?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the Chinese market is going to be the fastest-growing
large market, by far. There will be, I think, some challenges in
the economy there. It's not likely to go straight up forever, but
by and large this is going to be the fastest-growing market that we
and many companies have. As you get increased industrialization in
China, the computerization and the whole communications revolution,
I mean, the computer industry is in a great position there. If you
look at the growth of the telephone industry, you can kind of see a
precursor to what we think computing will look like in China. And
it has a lot of potential for our company. (Dell China President)
David (Chan) was a key exec in our Asia business, and now he's
totally dedicated just to China. We're spending a lot of time there
. . . because we think it's going to be a very key market for us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you assess the progress so far of your China
manufacturing and sales operations?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's very positive. It's quite impressive to see them kind of
knocking down milestones in terms of quality, order run rates, and
capacity. Customer visits are much faster than we've seen in any
other operation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think could be improved in China? What success
here has surprised you?
</P>
<P>
   A: You still have a roll-out of communications going on across
the country that doesn't reach all of the population. The relevant
thing for us, of course, is that people who have telephones are our
primary target before the people who don't. So, the end of the
railroad track is way out there for us.

<P>
   XIAMEN, China _ One is a soft-spoken Singaporean, the other an
exuberant Irishman. Together they are the flint and steel of the
sales fire Dell Computer Corp. wants to sweep across the world's
biggest potential market.
</P>
<P>
   David Chan and Buddy Griffin are the uncommon pair the Austin,
Texas-based Dell teamed up to convey its new and very Western go-go
style into this ancient land that even today often moves to a
ponderous cadence of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last six months we have gone out and met the media, met
with the key customer organizations, both international and Chinese
companies,'' said Chan, president of operations in China and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that sometimes they don't buy into our model, so this
means that people are not sure whether the direct-sell model will
work.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chan, 43, is responsible overall for China, he is
essentially the outside man in charge of sales and strategic
planning. He is a clever choice, a marketing specialist trailing 15
years experience with IBM and contacts throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   The sone of Chinese parents, Chan carries a sense of Asian
centeredness that keeps him calm when discussing the urgency of
business, and comfortable in a casual sweater when surrounded by
suits and ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The products are great. Product, quality, pricing, that's not
a problem,'' he said in an interview with the Cox News Service.
``People continue to be our biggest challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   His job is convincing China's foremost bureaucrats, enterprise
directors and entrepreneurs that they can buy complicated,
expensive equipment in a new way. They can write their own specs,
hand them directly to Dell and get the product delivered fast,
without paying a middle-man to tell them what they need.
</P>
<P>
   In a society eternally hierarchical, from long before Confucius
to decades after Mao Tse-tung, that means convincing people they
can safely take on new responsibility. They won't need a middle-man
to blame when something goes wrong, because they can do it
themselves and do it right.
</P>
<P>
   Chan, a Dell believer recruited to the company's Malaysia
operation in 1996, also has to convince his own salespeople. They
work here, and in seven other urban sales and service offices
around China.
</P>
<P>
   To grow at the rate he wants to grow, Chan said, he must better
train the sales, service and technical staff in ``how to go after
the bigger market.'' Chan himself travels constantly to multiply
Dell China sales, averaging one-and-a-half days at each stop.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin is the inside man, the nuts-and-bolts executive who gets
the machines made and delivered -- after building up the factory,
hiring the hands and starting the assembly line. His Dell team
accomplished that last August, four and a half months after Dell
announced the decision to locate its China Customer Center in
Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell Austin one day was as small as we are,'' said Griffin,
describing in his rolling Irish brogue an expectation of explosive
growth. ``We are the babies of the moment. China won't be the baby
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, 50, has seen that growth. He personally started up two
other major Dell centers. First, the Limerick supplier for European
operations in his native Ireland when he joined Dell in 1990; then,
five years later the plant in Penang, Malaysia. Now he is vice
president-manufacturing, at the China Customer Center for Dell,
Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline and organization are qualities central to his job.
And Griffin surely harbors them, describing a routine of sleeping
from midnight to 5 a.m., then rising from the Xiamen hotel suite
where he lives to jog every morning before donning a crisp white
shirt and tie.
</P>
<P>
   When he isn't answering e-mail or kidding the elevator operator,
he seems to be massaging relations with city officials, who are key
to untangling China's skeins of red tape. Or he's chatting up
Xiamen's university and community figures, who are key to supplying
a steady workforce.
</P>
<P>
   A demonstrably friendly fellow, Griffin doesn't even print his
formal name -- John Francis -- on his business cards. It's just
Buddy, the name bestowed by his sister 40-odd years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his optimistic outlook, Griffin, too, must handle
up-close encounters at the cultural divide. It separates
adapt-to-the-moment capitalists from a Chinese people still
straining the strictures of a communist order that guaranteed a
minimum wage and prohibited maximum profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we like it or not our business oscillates. And we
oscillate. And we knee-jerk and we have to rush and hurry it,'' he
said. ``I'd say that we're a culture shock to many people. We're a
build-to-order company. Today, right now, my bet is that our
production guys won't know what they'll be doing tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, on that Monday afternoon in early February, his
production guys weren't working. Needed parts hadn't arrived. But
they did eventually, and the assembly line ran from 6:30 p.m. to 9
p.m. Workers were at it again at 8 o'clock the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   That is not normal in China. White-collar workers usually take a
two-hour lunch break and often can't be found after 5 p.m.
Factories have set shifts with strictly regulated overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has adapted, too. It runs a dormitory next to the factory
for about 50 key Chinese workers who live too far to commute, and
runs a series of buses for employees with homes in Xiamen proper,
about 15 miles away.

 &HT;    DELL MUSCLES INTO LATIN AMERICA DESPITE THE REGION'S ECONOMIC
TURMOIL
 &HT;    With DELL-SIDE-$ADV21.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For Latin America, 1997 couldn't have been a better
year. Intel Corp. picked Costa Rica over Ireland as the site for a
new $300 million operation, while a growing middle class developed
a voracious appetite for personal computers, creating a boon for
U.S. computer companies.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Asian flu took hold and the Russian economy
collapsed, sending Latin America's economies into a tailspin as
economic turmoil pinched consumers' ability to buy electronics,
affecting the volume and profit margins of U.S. computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   So why -- against such a grim backdrop -- would Dell Computer
Corp. want to pump as much as $125 million into a Brazilian
operation over the next six years?
</P>
<P>
   Because, as Dell officials will attest, it's the long-term
outlook -- and not the current reality -- that really drives any
successful company's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is an untapped market and so the new operation we have
planned there is a long-term strategic decision as part of our
global expansion,'' explained Dell spokeswoman Deborah Cromer.
``Certainly we're watching the financial situation in Brazil, but
it hasn't gotten to the point that we've made changes in our
long-term strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Austin, Texas-based company has signed an agreement with the
industrially powerful Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul to
construct a sales and manufacturing center there, possibly by the
end of the year. Eventually, it will employ up to 260 people and
serve as a hub for sales throughout the Southern Common Market
known as Mercosur, which includes Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and
Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   To Dell officials, it makes perfect sense to establish a site in
Brazil, even if its $800 billion economy is headed toward severe
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as large as the United States, the South American giant
is home to 164 million potential consumers.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Brazil's personal computer market remains a
lucrative one that's valued at $2.7 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   And, certainly, Dell's no stranger to Latin America. Company
officials are quick to point out that Austin is closer to Mexico
City than it is to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Dell made its first foray into the region six years ago by
opening an office in Mexico. On its heels were offices in both
Chile and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   And Dell's investments in the region aren't expected to end
there.
</P>
<P>
   Next on the horizon for Dell could be a fifth office in
Argentina, Dell's third largest Latin American market behind Brazil
and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Argentina is showing big growth and it's become a very
important long-term market for us,'' said Daryl Robertson, vice
president for Dell Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Latin countries export heavily to Brazil, meaning
they're likely to be dragged down by Brazil's instability, and the
growth rate of PC sales in Latin America slowed by nearly half in
1998, Dell officials are anything but pessimistic. They insist the
demand for their products in Latin America has surpassed company
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   They are confident they can replicate the success they've
enjoyed in North America, where Dell has earned some 20 percent of
the PC market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell has been seeing growth in Latin America that's several
times the market growth rate,'' Robertson said, declining to be
more specific.
</P>
<P>
   But even Dell officials admit that success in developing markets
is almost always built on risk, especially in the mercurial world
of high technology.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to tightening credit and plunging currencies, Brazilians,
for example, haven't been able to afford a car payment in recent
months, let alone a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next decade, Brazil will be a very valuable market
for U.S. consumer products, but right now people are hesitant to
buy anything in the midst of so much economic and political
uncertainty,'' said Don Bowler, regional director for Latin America
for the Economist Intelligence Unit in London.

   BUDAI, Lebanon _ The farmers in the fertile Bekaa Valley
longingly recall the good ol' days, when lush fields of hashish and
opium provided for BMWs, chic leather jackets and schooling for
their children at prestigious American universities.
</P>
<P>
   That came to an end in the early 1990s. With pressure and help
from the United States, Lebanese army tractors plowed up the crops
and soldiers enforced tough anti-drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released this week(CQ), the U.S. State Department
praised the near-total elimination of drug crops in the Bekaa
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But, the victory for America's war on drugs is also a public
relations triumph for the anti-American Hezbollah, which has come
to the aid of farmers while international bureaucracies struggle to
provide alternatives for drug farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hezbollah is the answer,'' says Mohammad Shammas, a
48-year-old farmer who used to grow hashish and now raises
chickens. Sitting in a house that is large but rundown, he ticks
off the benefits of Hezbollah: ``They pay money. They build
schools. They do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Hezbollah is not the only group trying to help the
farmers. But, the centerpiece effort, by the United Nations, has
had only mixed results. A U.S. program shows potential, but is
still new, and the Lebanese government has done little. Meanwhile,
Hezbollah, has been able to play Robin Hood against the perceived
injustices of the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could argue that (the drug) program ended the empire of
hashish,'' said Nizar Hamzeh, an expert on Hezbollah at the
American University in Beirut. ``(But) the consequence was
basically boosting the image of Hezbollah . . . These people are
really depending on Hezbollah aid.''
</P>
<P>
   The chaos of the 16-year Lebanese civil war, ending in 1991,
allowed farmers in this large plain near the Syrian border to
openly cultivate drugs for export to Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that as many as 65,000 farms were
involved. Farmers say hashish is no more dangerous than alcohol,
and they deny responsibility for what was done with the opium. They
claim they were promised help by their government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they were going to pay us something for what we
lost, but they didn't,'' says farmer Ali Salwan, 64, who has sold a
car, carpets and appliances since he gave up hashish farming. He
says he now grows wheat at barely 15 percent the price of cannabis.
</P>
<P>
   The Bekaa is now one of the poorest areas of Lebanon. Houses are
sparsely-furnished and dilapidated. The poverty is not at the level
of some African or Latin American nations, but drinking water is in
short supply, youth are moving to the crowded cities and per capita
income is around $1,700 a year.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed ``Party of
God,'' has been strong in the region and has used it to base
training camps for guerrillas fighting Israel's 17-year-occupation
of southern Lebanon. At night, Hezbollah recruits can be seen
goose-stepping along the narrow country roads.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah became infamous in the 1980s, when it was blamed for a
series of kidnappings. The U.S. government considers it a terrorist
organization. In the last two weeks, it has displayed its
battlefield skill by killing seven Israelis, including a brigadier
general.
</P>
<P>
   But, it is also a political party in the Lebanese parliament and
a social network that builds schools and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The party subsidizes poor families with $200 to $500 a month and
gives money for tractors, fertilizers and even irrigation systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hezbollah is against drugs and our (Muslim) religion is
against drugs,'' says Hezbollah Sheikh Nabil Kaouk. ``(But)
supporting people in the Bekaa comes from our belief in helping the
poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary need for the valley is water. Most legal crops need
more water than hashish. The farmers also need loans, healthcare,
access to markets and expertise for crops they may not have grown
before.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department narcotics report said the UN's program to
address those needs has spent its money ``inefficiently,'' and UN
officials acknowledge they have not raised half the $50 million
needed for the valley.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the U.S. Agency for International Development, or
USAID, began a five-year project aimed at helping rural communities
throughout Lebanon. The Bekaa portion has spent about $2.2 million
in 74 villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there are a number of issues with availability of
water, marketing of new crops, viability of new crops,'' said
Lebanon USAID mission director James Stephenson. ``This takes time.
There is no quick fix. (But) I would be optimistic that those
problems can be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The USAID program is new, but it uses contributions from the
farmers themselves and expertise from the American University in
Beirut. Providing skills and markets, it could promise a better
future than Hezbollah's subsidy approach.
</P>
<P>
   That, ultimately, might be fine with Hezbollah. Analyst Hamzeh
said the Bekaa work stretches the party's budget. Sheikh Kaouk
acknowledges, ``financially, we are limited. There are other places
we need to spend.''

BARBIE: ALL DOLLED UP EVEN AT 40 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATE GURNETT  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Barbie. Revered, reviled, renewed, tatooed and
debunked.
</P>
<P>
   As if that weren't enough, now she turns 40. On March 9. Don't
expect a midlife crisis. Crow's-feet don't sell.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a career change. It's Barbie's favorite catharsis! She's
had 75, from surgeon to ambassador to rock star.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ole Babs is probably closer to 56 (Remember, she was a
teen-age model when she debuted in March 1959 for $3.)
</P>
<P>
   So today, in her tiny arched feet and her favorite color (pink),
Barbie can smile without a care while those around her reflect on
her life. Her tens of thousands of collectors include celebrities
such as Demi Moore, Roseanne and Danielle Steele. As a child,
singer Ru-Paul collected Barbies and cut off their breasts. Drag
queens say Barbie makes the perfect model: broad shoulders, narrow
hips and ample bosom.
</P>
<P>
   For such fans, the Mattel Inc. doll's got it all over other
American icons, argues M.G. Lord, author of ``Forever Barbie: The
Unauthorized Biography of a Real Doll'' (William Morrow and Co.
Inc., 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Elvis or Marilyn or even Madonna, Barbie will never
bloat. Or wrinkle, rot or overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Lord, who cross-dressed her own Ken doll as a girl, admits to
having a Midge complex (those feelings of inferiority that stem
from hanging out with Barbie's second-fiddle friend). In pursuit of
the truth about this plastic doll that still rings up $2 billion in
annual sales, Lord uncovered some little-known Barbie data. Such
as: Our very own Babs is based on a German hooker doll called the
Bild Lilli, a postwar gag gift for men sold in tobacco shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether more or less naked, Lilli is always discreet,''
proclaimed one brochure promoting Lilli's wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie's first outfits (she began with 22) were sewn by Japanese
housewives. The doll was manufactured in Tokyo; manufacturers here
said it couldn't be done. Included was a girdle. (Maybe it doubled
as a sports bra?)
</P>
<P>
   Barbie's official name is Barbie Millicent Roberts from Willows,
Wis., though her creator Ruth Handler lived in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   She's a Pisces, sensitive and moody. That might explain all the
wardrobe changes.
</P>
<P>
   Early marketing studies found mothers complaining that Barbie
was too suggestive. Girls, however, liked the doll.
</P>
<P>
   Handler fought against the desires of male executives to have a
bulge added to the Ken doll's groin. She won. Handler blocked
efforts to have Barbie wed _ or breed. And no vacuuming. Barbie
doesn't do ``rough housework.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Mattel introduced Living Barbie, whose jointed ankles
permitted her to walk flat-footed. A year later, the model was
discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Barbie's eyes, which had been cast down and to one side
on a gaze common in early paintings of pornographic nudes, were
changed. Malibu Barbie looked straight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, when Mattel faced financial ruin, the company was saved
by junk bond king Michael Milken and others who invested $231
million _ based on Barbie's profitable track record.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the new astronaut Barbie ditched her puffy 1965
spacesuit for a hot pink miniskirt, a clear plastic helmet, a sleek
pink bodysuit and silver space lingerie. And then, there was the
new ``realistic'' Barbie who debuted with smaller measurements last
year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Mattel fought slumping sales with Butterfly Art
Barbie, who sports a butterfly tattoo on her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   But what of Barbie's ``real'' family? Handler was a stenographer
at Paramount Pictures before she and her husband Elliot, a
furniture designer and art student, created the Barbie doll.
Elliot, who used Plexiglas, lucite and plastic in his furniture,
transferred the technology to the doll.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Ruth Handler named the Barbie and Ken dolls after her
children, Barbie and Ken.
</P>
<P>
   No, Ken didn't model himself after the doll. (Although his
sister stuck pretty close to the Barbie doctrine, he told Lord.)
</P>
<P>
   If Ken Handler had his way, Barbie and Ken would parrot his
lifestyle: Train as ethnobotanists, study the curative values of
the South American rain forests, ``tan themselves in the sweat of
the equatorial jungle sun and give themselves to people that
desperately need to learn from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the real Ken encourage his children play with the Barbie
doll. ``This bimba ... never has a serious thought,'' he told Lord.
``And she has a figure no young lady could ever achieve without a
severe anorexic leaning or surgery.''

 &HT;    As academia embraces lies of `larger truth,' true scholar
prevails

   &QR;  Rigoberta Menchu and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans. By
David Stoll. Westview Press. $27. 400 pages.
</P>
<P>
   If you enrolled at the University of Maine in the fall of 1996,
there was one book you could be certain you would read. The book
was ``I, Rigoberta Menchu,'' by the winner of the 1992 Nobel Peace
Prize.
</P>
<P>
   The memoir of a Mayan woman who claims to have seen family
members tortured and burned alive during Guatemala's civil war,
``I, Rigoberta Menchu'' was chosen as the ``class book'' for the
Class of 2000. If you wanted to graduate, you read it. And you
would read it in more places than just the University of Maine. On
campuses in this country and others, it is required reading.
</P>
<P>
   If the Nobel Peace Prize is the secular equivalent of
canonization, Menchu has been sainted by the academy as well. Her
testimonio was the authentic voice of indigenous peoples in the New
World and of women everywhere, a young girl denied an education,
sent into the coffee fields to work from sunup to sundown,
traumatized by the death of her brother and her father at the hands
of the Guatemalan army. It has become a cornerstone of the
multicultural curriculum, so much so that it is read in courses
where you might least expect it _ English, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Now it turns out that her book is not entirely true _ is, in
fact, false in significant respects. The academic left, tremulous
in its reverence for the author, has egg on its face yet again. But
so, too, does the Nobel Prize Committee, along with journalists who
never thought to question Menchu's story. In the wake of so much
farce, one brave scholar, David Stoll, an anthropologist at
Middlebury College, deserves a prize of his own, not the Nobel
perhaps but something on the order of the Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rigoberta Menchu and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans''
demythologizes a Mayan woman whose presence elicits tears on
campuses and a book that has been translated into 12 languages. The
author herself claims that some 15,000 scholarly papers _ assiduous
as biblical commentaries _ have been written on her book since its
publication in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Stoll realizes he has committed heresy, but he is not without
sympathy for Menchu. When he first heard her story, he was disposed
to believe it like anyone else. But during the 1980s, while he was
interviewing victims of Guatemala's political violence, he stumbled
upon first one fact and then another that didn't fit. Menchu, he
learned, was not an uneducated peasant's daughter, but a girl who
had been sent to a Catholic boarding school. She picked no coffee
and her father was not cheated out of his land by rich ladinos
(Guatemalans of European descent). He lost it in a dispute with his
Mayan in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   No one is so romantic as the hero-worshipping academic, and no
one quicker to hiss when the daydream is punctured. ``Whether her
book is true or not, I don't care,'' Marjorie Agosin, head of the
Spanish department at Wellesley College, told the Chronicle of
Higher Education. For the true believers, it represents that
all-purpose ``larger truth,'' malleable as putty in constructing
multicultural illusions. It's the same hear-nothing, know-nothing
response that followed revelations of Tawana Brawley's
fabrications. Patricia Williams of the Harvard Law School said it
mattered little that Tawana's story of rape was without factual
basis. It was true in a symbolic sense. (The rights and reputation
of the accused apparently didn't matter either.)
</P>
<P>
   In Menchu's case, there was enough truth that fabrication ought
not have been necessary. Only a little more than a week ago, a
United Nations commission concluded that the CIA had given money
and training to the Guatemalan military, and had abetted ``acts of
genocide'' against Mayans during the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   No one questions this, least of all Stoll. Menchu's father was
in fact burned alive, her brother was executed by the army and her
mother did ``disappear.'' But none of it happened as she describes;
some of it happened quite differently. The fire in which her father
died, during a takeover of the Spanish embassy in 1980, was sparked
by the guerrillas' Molotov cocktails. When violence is cyclical,
Stoll argues, identifying victims and victimizers cannot be done
with the moral certitude that graduate students and assistant
professors on distant campuses would like to believe.
</P>
<P>
   But they believe anyway. It is a psychological need, and books
such as Menchu's, Stoll writes, ``will be exalted because they tell
academics what they want to hear. ... The simplistic images of
innocence, oppression and defiance can be used to construct
mythologies of purity for academic factions claiming moral
authority on the grounds that they identify with the oppressed.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, inevitably, that authority collapses, like a sinkhole.
If books such as Menchu's are going to be required reading, then
Stoll's is more necessary still _ as a corrective to an
intellectual bankruptcy that is not merely accepted but embraced.

 &HT;    Conroy first to win Stanley Lindberg award
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For more than two decades, Stanley Lindberg has been
an unsung hero on Georgia's literary scene. As editor of the
Georgia Review, he transformed the magazine into an award-winning
publication. In 1985, he organized the successful Roots of Georgia
conference, bringing together all of the state's top writers, from
James Dickey to Erskine Caldwell. And in 1996, he brought Toni
Morrison and other Nobel laureates to Atlanta as part of the
Cultural Olympiad.
</P>
<P>
   All of this he did with little fanfare or self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lindberg is scheduled to be honored alongside another
Georgia writer who is not so unsung. On April 24, Pat Conroy will
receive the first Stanley W. Lindberg Award in ceremonies at the
Georgia Center for Continuing Education beginning at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Novelist Terry Kay, who will deliver the opening remarks,
praised Lindberg as ``one of the most important figures in the
history of letters in the South. We felt it was proper to honor him
by establishing a career-achievement award in his name.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley W. Lindberg Award will be given every two years to a
person who has contributed substantially to the literary culture of
Georgia through a lifetime body of work. The event is co-sponsored
by the Georgia Center for the Book, a statewide program that
celebrates books, reading and literacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a totally unexpected and humbling experience to be
honored in this fashion _ and somewhat unusual, I understand, for
one to enjoy such homage while still alive to blush,'' says
Lindberg, who has been editor of the Georgia Review since 1977. ``I
am, of course, deeply grateful to those who have defined and
established this worthy prize, and I salute Pat Conroy as its
distinguished first recipient.''
</P>
<P>
   Conroy is best known for his rich, lyrical style and for the
series of highly successful movies made from his books, but the
author of ``The Great Santini'' and ``Beach Music'' was also
extremely influential in establishing a writing community in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Pat moved to Atlanta in 1973, there were fewer than 10
people in Georgia being published by major houses,'' Kay says.
``Within three years, a number of people were being published.
Pat's influence, either directly or indirectly, played a role in
all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to the black-tie event in Athens are $40 each. The
reservations deadline is April 12. Checks should be made payable to
the University of Georgia and mailed to the Stanley W. Lindberg
Award at the Georgia Center for Continuing Education, University of
Georgia, Athens, GA 30602-3603, along with the name and address of
the person who will be attending the event.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Lindberg award, Conroy is scheduled to
receive the Grand Master Award at the Writing Today conference
March 12-13 at Birmingham-Southern College. Previous winners
include Dickey, Caldwell, Ray Bradbury and Edward Albee.
</P>
<P>
   Gurganus at work on novellas
</P>
<P>
   If Allan Gurganus had listened to his readers, he would have
written a half-dozen sequels to his best-selling tome, ``Oldest
Living Confederate Widow Tells All.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 51-year-old writer went in a different direction.
His latest book, ``Plays Well With Others'' (Random House, $14
paperback), depicts the gay art scene in New York in the 1980s. The
book sold well, he says, but reviews were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always some initial resistance when you present a book
that's unlike your other books,'' says Gurganus, who will be here
next week to sign books. ``Some people were bothered that I would
write a comic novel about something as dark as the pandemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurganus, a North Carolina native who moved back from New York
to the Chapel Hill area recently, has been working on a book of
five novellas, ``Fables for Adults,'' which will be published next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Taylor defined a novella as a work of fiction you can
pick up after dinner and finish before bedtime. It's a perfect
length for the way people read now and the way we live now. I love
that length. You can have all of the intensity of the novel yet
leave out the secondary characters who walk on for comic relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurganus will be at Borders Books and Music in Atlanta (3637
Peachtree Road N.E., 404-237-0707) at 7 p.m. Tuesday.

 &HT;    Nijinsky: Portrait of the artist as a madman
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nijinsky myth has come down to us as a titillating mixture
of sex and madness. We have the photographs of the great Russian
dancer _ the faun in the fig leaf, the slave prancing ecstatically
in yards of gold lame. And we have the diary, which he wrote in
1917-1918 as he leapt full throttle into schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky'' _ widely believed to be the
only first-person, on-the-spot account of a major artist's collapse
into psychosis _ is a harrowing book. Losing one's mind is not
romantic. But, oh, how we like to think it is.
</P>
<P>
   Look a little deeper into van Gogh's swirling rosettes, Sylvia
Plath's self-lacerating verse or Nijinsky's confessions and you
won't see much to commend the process of going crazy. It is a sad,
sordid business, made worse by the fact that we, the witnesses,
tend to recoil in horror. But isn't it ourselves that we grieve
for?
</P>
<P>
   No one knew that better than Nijinsky's wife, Romola. When she
first published her husband's diary, in 1936, it was a heavily
edited, self-serving version that tried to put a benign spin on
Nijinsky's homosexuality, among other things. It did the trick.
Though Nijinsky was to live under lock and key until he was 60, the
diary had imbued him with an aura of early autumn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became a symbol for that part of us that, in fantasy, takes
off for the high hills, as opposed to the part that stays home,''
Joan Acocella writes in the introduction to this newly restored
version, freshly translated by Kyril FitzLyon. ``Nijinsky had
always been famous for his jump. As witnesses describe it, he would
rise and then pause in the air before coming down. Now, it seemed,
he had declined to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Acocella _ the dance critic for The New Yorker, who has written
a biography of choreographer Mark Morris and co-authored a textbook
on abnormal psychology _ goes about her scholarship with authority
and passion. In her insightful essay and annotations, she makes a
case for Nijinsky's genius, rather than relegating him to the file
of psychological oddity or cult personality. She restores the
integrity of his text _ and brings him to the attention of a new
generation of readers. I only wish someone had remembered to
include an index.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking for a lurid memoir may be disappointed by this
``unexpurgated'' diary. Though Nijinsky lived openly with Ballet
Russes director Sergei Diaghilev _ and was a star dancer of that
international ensemble _ he was by his own account a lover of
women. His marriage to Romola de Pulszky in 1913 was a slap in the
face to Diaghilev. As their relationship crumbled, so did
Nijinsky's health.
</P>
<P>
   Like any portrait of a madman, this is a strange little book, at
times reading like surrealistic fiction by Kafka or Borges. ``I
will build a bridge between Europe and America that will not cost
much,'' Nijinsky writes. ``I already know the method for building
this bridge, because God has told me.''
</P>
<P>
   The memoir often finds Nijinsky raging against his enemies and
worshipping his heroes. He has adopted the all-embracing empathy of
Tolstoy and believes that man is losing his sense of ``feeling.''
He is obsessed with his bodily functions and tries to give up
eating meat. He not only believes in his kinship with God, but that
he is God. He even
</P>
<P>
   signs one of the volumes ``God Nijinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone fascinated by the fragmentation of the human psyche
should read this book. But be forewarned: It can be painful.
Waiting for Nijinsky's wife and mother-in-law to take him to the
asylum is like waiting for a ride to the charnel house. ``I heard
the voice of my little Kyra,'' Nijinsky writes of his 3-year-old
daughter in the final pages. ``She loves me, because she wept when
I told her I was going away forever.''
</P>

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray and Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affliction'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nick Nolte and James Coburn.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar nominee Nick Nolte gives a searing, career-defining
performance in this soul-weary study of one of the walking dead.
Nolte plays a troubled New England cop whose ``afflictions''
include an angry ex-wife, a frightened young daughter, a boss who
belittles him and a roaringly abusive father (James Coburn, also
Oscar-nominated). 1 hour, 44 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyze This'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal and Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   This farce about a mobster (Robert De Niro) who takes his issues
to a psychiatrist (Billy Crystal) never becomes the laugh-riot it
could be. It's an offer you could refuse, but the stars (plus Lisa
Kudrow as Crystal's fiancee) make it worthwhile.1 hour, 46 minutes.
B
</P>
<P>
   ``Blast From the Past'' PG-13 (profanity, sex, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser, Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser does another culture-clash, fish-out-of-water
flick, playing a guy who climbs into the '90s after spending all
his life in a bomb shelter. You wait for the high-concept comedy to
make some smart observations (or at least some decent jokes) about
the collision of the '60s and '90s. But the humor and the plot are
amateurish, leaving its cast flailing. 1 hour, 52 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   A multi-legged wonder. The newest computer-animated feature from
the makers of ``Toy Story'' is the eye-popping, witty tale of an
ant named Flik (voice of Dave Foley), who recruits a bunch of
circus bugs to battle evil grasshoppers (the chief villain is
voiced by Kevin Spacey). There's enough going on here to keep every
adult, child or arachnid vastly entertained. 1 hour, 34 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Central Station'' R (profanity and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Fernanda Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   In this tender and unexpectedly moving Brazilian film, a sour
old woman (Oscar nominee Fernanda Montenegro) takes a motherless
boy she barely knows into rural Brazil to find the father he's
never met. Montenegro's performance is a beautiful study in
bitterness dissuaded, of possibility and optimism stumbled on after
too long an absence from someone's life. Subtitles. 1 hour, 55
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' PG-13 (profanity and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a true story, this legal thriller stars John Travolta
as a small-time personal injury lawyer who tackles two giant
corporations. Oscar nominee Robert Duvall is his cagey opponent.
Travolta is miscast and the movie can't quite decide what its focus
is. Still, it more than makes its case with intelligence and
old-fashioned Hollywood ``let us entertain you'' craft. 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruel Intentions'' R (profanity, sexual situations, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Selma Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Last decade's ``Dangerous Liaisons'' gets a makeover with Sarah
Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillipe as a couple of desultorily rich
teens manipulating the romantic lives of everyone around them,
purely for their own amusement and without a whit of concern about
whom may be hurt in the process. It's practically guaranteed to be
a runaway hit with the teen audience at whom it is so obviously
aimed. 1 hour, 37 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight Millimeter'' R (strong perverse sexuality, violence,
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   A new example of Morbidity Chic from the screenwriter of
``Seven.'' Nicolas Cage plays a PI investigating the possible death
of a young girl in a snuff flick. It's an unpleasant crawl through
the world of porn; you can tell the filmmakers think it's a
troubling exploration of moral ambiguity, but it's an exploitation
flick tricked out as art.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 3 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett gives a luminous
portrayal, and Geoffrey Rush, also an Oscar nominee, gives her
sturdy support as court politics and intrigues swirl about. This is
a really good story. 2 hours, 4 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.''
</P>
<P>
   44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The General'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Gleeson.
</P>
<P>
   An entertaining character study of Martin Cahill, a real-life
Dublin criminal who was both lovable rogue and ugly thug. A cunning
thief who took everything from jewels to Vermeers, Cahill is shown
by writer/director John Boorman to be a natural contrarian, who
thumbed his nose at the IRA as well as the cops. Brendan Gleeson
gives a brilliant, blustery performance as Cahill.3 hours, 3
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' Not rated but sexual themes and brief
nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   Three Oscar nominations. A brilliant reimagining of the final
days of gay British director James Whale. Whale, best known for his
classic horror movies (``Bride of Frankenstein''), died
mysteriously in 1957. Played here by the marvelous Ian McKellen
(best actor), he's an isolated, forgotten recluse who becomes
interested in the hunky new gardener (Brendan Fraser). 1 hour, 35
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Jawbreaker'' R (profanity, sexuality and violence, all
involving teens)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart and Judy Evans Greer.
</P>
<P>
   Rose McGowan is the queen of mean in this high school comedy
about four teen girls who terrorize the hallways. Things get
complicated when one of the four accidentally dies, and her friends
cover it up. The black comedy borrows heavily from ``Carrie'' and
``Heathers,'' but it has a snappy style all its own.1 hour, 27
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Oscar nominations including best picture, best actor and
best screenplay. An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of
a concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game. Roberto Benigni's low-comedy slapstick
approach isn't entirely convincing and is often chillingly
wrongheaded. Subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Message in a Bottle'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn and Paul Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Two messages here: Old-fashioned romances still work, and Kevin
Costner needs an ego check. Badly. For a good while, the movie lets
us luxuriate in the pleasures of sailboats, sunsets, candlelit
dinners, etc. Plus, there's comic relief courtesy of Paul Newman
and Robbie Contrane. But the last 15 minutes are a lunkheaded
embarrassment and Costner (he co-produced) is to blame. 2 hours, 12
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``My Favorite Martian'' PG (violence, partial nudity and
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeff Daniels and Christopher Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   A big-screen remake of the '60s TV series, with the annoying and
unsubtle Christopher Lloyd as the Martian who camps in Jeff
Daniels' living room. The movie is cobbled together with cheesy
special effects and easy gags. But for kids, it's an OK babysitter.
1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' PG (profanity, sensuality, alcohol use, some
thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper and Laura Dern.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply satisfying tale of West Virginia teen Homer (Jake
Gyllenhaal) and three friends who, in the 1950s, began to build and
shoot off model rockets. Their goal: to win a science fair, which
could help them escape a future of working in the coal mine of
their small town. Based on Homer Hickman's autobiography ``Rocket
Boys,'' it makes the process of learning seem as exciting as a
special FX-driven action flick. 1 hour, 48 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Office Space'' R (profanity, partial nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston, Stephen Root and Gary
Cole.
</P>
<P>
   An amusingly and eerily familiar comedy for anyone who's ever
struggled against the monotonous mind control of a large corporate
workplace. After wittily building audience resentment for nearly 90
minutes, writer-director Mike Judge (TV's ``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head,''
``King of the Hill'') seems to pull his punches with a
less-than-apocalyptic ending.
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 1 hour, 30 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Other Sister'' PG-13 (thematic elements involving
sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Juliette Lewis and Diane Keaton.
</P>
<P>
   Juliette Lewis' effective performance as a mentally challenged
woman is the best reason to see this comedy drama, an uneasy
mixture of sentimentality and yucks. Diane Keaton plays her
overprotective mother, and Giovanni Ribisi (also very strong) is
the man she falls for. 2 hours, 11 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams'' PG-13 (profanity, crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a renegade med student who believes the
rigid rules of health care could use a few laughs. It's ``Dead
Poets Society'' with lab coats. The laughs are good, but when it
tries to get serious (often), the flick is as deep as a bedpan.1
hour, 56 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback'' R (violence, profanity, drug and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry.
</P>
<P>
   A by-the-numbers vengeance thriller starring Mel Gibson. It's as
generic as its unnamed, dull gray city. 1 hour, 42 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' PG (violence, intense themes)
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular animated musical epic that retells _ with some
embellishments _ the Book of Exodus. Val Kilmer is the voice of
Moses, God's choice to lead the Hebrew people from slavery in
Egypt. Ralph Fiennes speaks for the Pharaoh, Moses' ``adopted''
brother. Other talent includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and
a host of animators. The movie is visually impressive, insistently
reverential.1 hour, 39 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' R (profanity and brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Olivia Williams.
</P>
<P>
   This original prep school fable pits 15-year-old Max (Jason
Schwartzman) against a tycoon (Bill Murray) in a battle for the
love of a schoolteacher (Olivia Williams). The second film from
director Wes Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson proves that they
haven't lost the off-kilter wit and viewpoint they first showed in
``Bottle Rocket.''
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 33 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' R (extreme violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon and Edward Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Oscar nominations including best picture. Part gung-ho
heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven Spielberg's superb
film shows us World War II as we've never seen it before. Tom Hanks
leads a courageous squad on a mission to find a private whose three
brothers have already been killed in combat. 2 hours, 50 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' R (sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen Oscar nominations including best picture. Poor,
overworked Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish his play
``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win the hand
of noblewoman Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) in this witty comedy that
uses some of the Bard's more outrageous plot devices. At metro
theaters. 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``She's All That'' PG-13 (profanity, sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Rachael Leigh Cook.
</P>
<P>
   High school star Zack (Freddie Prinze Jr.) accepts a bet to turn
geeky Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook) into a prom queen, and falls in
love with her. An amusing, genial reworking of ``Pygmalion,'' the
comedy has one big problem: Its leads are beautiful, but distant. 1
hour, 37 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' R (profanity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Anything but simple, this is a character-driven black comedy
with some powerful moral-qualm undercurrents. In the deep snows of
rural Minnesota, two brothers (Bill Paxton, Oscar nominee Billy Bob
Thornton) and a pal (Brent Briscoe) find a downed plane with $4
million in cash. Their ``simple plan'' to split the money leads to
a chain of increasingly disastrous events. 1 hour, 57 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' PG (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner and Donna Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise crew save an eternally youthful tribe from an
ugly crowd that wants to steal their juju. The movie is full of
jokes and decent special effects. But it seems primarily designed
for Trekkies who need an update on their intergalactic family
album. 1 hour, 44 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Steam: The Turkish Bath'' Not rated but has adult sexual
themes.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alessandro Gassman.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian yuppie goes to Istanbul to dispose of the property
left him by his aunt. He intends to sell everything and get home
quickly, but once there, he's seduced. By the city, by a
warmhearted Turkish family, by a new sense of himself and his
sexuality. The plot is soggily familiar, but as a love letter to
Istanbul, it is quite wonderful. Subtitles. 1 hour, 34 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line'' R (profanity and war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson
and Adrien Brody.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Oscar nominations including best picture. Less a war movie
than a meditation on life, death, love, hate, man and nature.
Terrence Malick puts his unmistakable stamp on the drama of an Army
division's struggle to capture Guadalcanal from the Japanese during
World War II. 2 hours, 50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally, alone with it, accidentally cracks it and is
thrust back in time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed
the Earth. 40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``200 Cigarettes'' R (profanity, sexual situations, alcohol use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Courtney Love, Ben Affleck and Christina Ricci.
</P>
<P>
   Like a New Year's Eve nightmare writ large, numerous New Yorkers
struggle to hook up with someone on the way to an end-of-1991
party. Most of the characters are obnoxious and sex-obsessed, but a
few performances, the only-in-the '80s outfits and most especially,
the music, shine through. 1 hour, 27 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Varsity Blues'' R (profanity, sexuality, nudity, substance
abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Van Der Beek and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   James Van Der Beek plays a high school football player in this
insulting mix of beery teenage humor and rampant sexuality. 1 hour,
40 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some IMAX films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
41 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   This Internet-era update of ``The Shop Around the Corner'' stars
Tom Hanks as a book-chain magnate and Meg Ryan as the small-store
owner he's putting out of business. Little do they know that
they're each other's e-mail sweethearts. ``Sleepless in Seattle''
director Nora Ephron gets the charm working again in a remake that
delivers.2 hours. B

 &HT;    Calculated cruelty meets hopped-up high school hormones
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Advance word had described ``Cruel Intentions'' as being a high
school version of ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' and it seems that, for
once, a movie lives up to its billing. Or down to it, depending on
your perspective, which probably directly relates to how many years
have elapsed since your last prom invite.
</P>
<P>
   The two movies do share the same basic plot outline _ a couple
of desultorily rich people manipulate the romantic lives of
everyone around them, purely for their own amusement and without a
whit of concern about who may get hurt in the process. But, whereas
the 1988 Oscar-winning ``Liaisons,'' with Glenn Close and John
Malkovich, slowly and skillfully seduced viewers to fall into its
web of intrigue, ``Cruel Intentions'' comes on with all the finesse
of a horny kid with only an hour to score before Mom and Dad get
home from the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Thus does Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe) snap nude photos of his
shrink's daughter and post them on the Internet. And rub his body
all over his stepsister and fellow teenager, Kathryn (Sarah
Michelle Gellar), frequently and friskily enough to make Jerry
Falwell forget all about that little Tinky Winky problem.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, meanwhile, Kathryn engages in long,
open-mouthed kissing with the virginal Cecile (Selma Blair), who
apparently needs lessons in how it's done. And Kathryn also offers
to sleep with Sebastian if only he manages to deflower the even
more virginal Annette (Reese Witherspoon).
</P>
<P>
   All this during summer break from their elite private school,
and all within the first 30 minutes of a movie that might better
have been titled, ``I Know Who You Did Last Summer.'' And all this
practically guaranteed to make ``Cruel Intentions'' a runaway hit
with the teen audience at which it is so obviously aimed.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the key components are in place: to wit, the adult
characters who are barely there, either literally (Kathryn and
Sebastian's parents are vacationing somewhere, leaving the
teenagers to their own devices and impossibly stylish clothes in a
massive Fifth Avenue mansion) or figuratively (indeed, Christine
Baranski, as Cecile's ``image is everything'' mother, and Louise
Fletcher, as Sebastian's ditzy aunt, ought to smack their agents _
hard).
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the stars of white-hot teen-oriented movies and
TV shows: Phillippe was in ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,''
while Gellar is TV's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' And finally, the
fantasy world where people under the age of 18 spend as much time
drinking expensive champagne as they do summoning limousines and
ordering the servants around.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing ``Cruel Intentions'' for being unrealistic, even
sexually irresponsible, would be about as pointless as a
well-meaning adult trying to convince a teenager that he or she is
really not in love for the first time. Adults probably just don't
get it in either case, although the broad laughter that greeted
some of ``Cruel Intentions' '' most emotionally charged moments at
a recent screening suggests that for some grown-ups, anyway, the
movie might prove to be amusingly entertaining viewing _ even
downright campy fun.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of us, we'll just have to accept that young
viewers could accept that a loathsome Lothario (and occasional
over-actor) like Sebastian could be suddenly redeemed by the love
of a good virgin like Annette, or that a stiletto-heeled, oversexed
vixen (and occasional over-actress) like Kathryn might actually
show up at school often enough to be elected senior class
president.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, though, the appeal of this movie will have less to
do with the story line and more with young viewers' getting to see
people very nearly their age dress up and do the sort of risque
things they almost never get to do.
</P>
<P>
   Not unless Mom and Dad linger a little too long at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruel Intentions''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, Selma Blair,
Reese Witherspoon and Joshua Jackson. Written and directed by Roger
Kumble. Rated R for sexual situations, profanity and alcohol and
drug use. 1 hour, 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: ``Dangerous Liaisons'' hits high school _ and Larry
Flynt writes the Cliffs Notes.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: FEDS SEEK TO PART THE DIGITAL WATERS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Mar. 7.
 &HT;    Moving in commentary (k) and business (f) queues.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON When our family goes off on vacation, we leave the
house keys with the neighbors, just in case something goes awry.
</P>
<P>
   For people who communicate on the Internet, encryption programs
are the ``house keys'' to security in the Information Age. These
programs scramble data into unreadable globs, insuring privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Encryption strength is measured in bits: the more bits, the
harder it is to crack the code. It's best to use a Web browser with
128-bit technology. Without such an industrial-strength browser,
neither my online bank nor my online broker will let me access my
files.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the administration limited U.S. firms seeking to
communicate with their foreign suppliers or customers to low-power
40-bit encryption programs, so the government could break the code.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, federal agencies raised the ceiling to 56 bits.
Government flacks issued press releases lauding their masters for
having taken such a gracious step. Attorney General Janet Reno
pleaded with business leaders to recognize that terrorists and
criminals also use the e-mails and must be watched.
</P>
<P>
   But they told her that they needed still more security to do
business overseas. So the feds said if you want to use something
stronger than 56 bits, then you'll have to incorporate ``key
recovery'' features into your encryption programs.
</P>
<P>
   That's the cyberspace equivalent of leaving the family house
keys behind -- with the feds as the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   If the White House has its way, these ``keys'' will be stored in
massive central databases that cops can access under a court order.
It's really no different, Reno says, than the wiretap laws now on
the books that help the FBI catch spies and drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the government argues, 56-bit keys should suffice. They
offer only one chance in 72,057,594,037,927,936 of breaking a code.
If each of these quadrillion-plus numbers were to be checked at a
rate of one per second, it would take 9 billion years to work
through the entire code set.
</P>
<P>
   In January, RSA Data Security, a software firm, offered $10,000
to the first group that could break its 56-bit encryption program.
It took a couple of hackers only 22 hours to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   So in February, RSA set up shop in Australia to market 128-bit
programs. Nobody notified Janet Reno about the loss of U.S. jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it would faze her. The attorney general hopes Congress
will pass a law that, in effect, orders anyone who does business
with the government to deposit a set of digital ``house keys.'' It
would be only a matter of time before such rules rippled through
the whole business world.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh points out that if Ramzi Yousef --
convicted of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing -- had used strong
encryption in his computer files, then his other murderous plans
might never have been known. If we can't decode it, Freeh argues,
then you shouldn't be using it.
</P>
<P>
   But the flow of cyberspace can't be turned off. And Freeh is no
Moses: he can't part the digital waters. In the long run, any
attempt to impose ``key recovery'' won't work. In the short run,
however, such efforts could cause an unholy mess by stifling
commerce and retarding the Internet's growth.

 &HT;    Director riding high _ lock, stock and barrels
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLNATA _ Some people making the rounds on a long publicity tour
cut the boredom by playing cards. Or reading. Or listening to
music.
</P>
<P>
   These lads are learning big, unwieldy words. Like ``apostasy,''
``sanguine'' and ``proselytize,'' exactly the sort of words you
won't hear in their movie ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been wondering where to use (expletive) `serendipity,'
'' says writer-director Guy Ritchie, relaxing recently at a Atlanta
pub with two of his cast members, Jason Statham and Jason Flemyng.
``We looked it up in the dictionary. Every city we go to, we win
points for who uses the longest words. And if you're in Chicago and
it begins with C, you get double points.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 30, but considered the Next Big Thing, Ritchie watched his
debut feature become the biggest-grossing British film of 1998.
(Last Monday it also nabbed a best British film nomination in
England's version of the Oscars.) ``It did $20 million, which for
the UK is a huge hit,'' he says. His movie was a crowd-pleaser at
Sundance, and he signed with a big Hollywood agency, ICM. Then
there's the Madonna thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only know her in a professional sense,'' Ritchie, 30, says
of the singer, with whom gossip columns linked him. You can tell
he's had plenty of practice saying that. (The official story: She
met him to discuss putting the soundtrack on her Maverick label.)
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie's action-comedy, opening in Atlanta on Friday, tells the
knotty story of four London East End friends (including the two
Jasons) who stake all their money on a poker game, blow it and have
to come up with half a million dollars _ or lose bits of their
anatomy piece by piece to the gangster they owe. It's been
described as a British take on Quentin Tarantino, but the movie's
tone owes as much to the helter-skelter styles of Danny Boyle
(``Trainspotting'') and Richard Lester (``Help!'').
</P>
<P>
   A comic hybrid
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand why people want to _ `compartmentalize'; that's
one of our new words,'' the director says with a grin. ``I can
understand why people want to compartmentalize it.'' (Two points
for Ritchie.) He has his own reference point for the movie: ``This
has more in common with an Ealing comedy than it does with
Tarantino,'' he says, referring to the series of dry British
comedies of the '40s and '50s, such as ``The Lavender Hill Mob''
and ``Kind Hearts and Coronets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying, incidentally, that it's completely free of the
influence of Tarantino,'' he adds. ``You just can't be anymore.''
One big difference, though: ``My movie's not taking itself too
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, except when it comes to the matter of casting. Some of the
movie's tough guys seem authentically tough, because they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted credibility,'' says Ritchie, who struggled for two
years to get the film funded because would-be backers wanted a
star. ``I wanted to use people who came from that world and
understood it.'' His example of the wrong way to cast a film is
``The Krays,'' which starred the pop-star Kemp brothers as the
notorious London gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Lock, Stock,'' Ritchie hired several nonprofessionals for
the cast, including Statham, 31, who spent five years selling stuff
on the streets. ``I told Guy about my shaky past and con men on the
street,'' the first-time actor says. ``He liked the fact that I had
a great understanding of the dialogue he'd written.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you get with Jay (Statham) is a credibility that
might be lacking,'' says his co-star Flemyng, 32, a professional
whose acting resume ranges from Bernardo Bertolucci's ``Stealing
Beauty'' to last year's monster-movie bomb ``Deep Rising.''
``Luckily, I'm born and bred in south London. I didn't go through
the public school, Merchant-Ivory system, so I know what I'm
talking about as well. But having Jay there gives you, osmotically,
an authenticity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Osmotically.'' (Two points for Flemyng.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gamble, really,'' Statham says about playing the
role. ``Guy didn't know whether I'd (mess) my pants in front of the
camera.'' Meanwhile, some people behind the scenes advised the
director against casting him. ``They said I'd be the catastrophe of
the bloody film. But not to my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicious verisimilitude
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of faces, Ritchie himself has his own brand of street
cred: A moon-shaped scar that swoops from the left corner of his
mouth up to his ear lobe. ``When I was about 20, I got into a knife
fight,'' he says. ``Big, isn't it? It makes it look like I know
what I'm writing about.''
</P>
<P>
   His next film will also star the Jasons, along with others of
the ``Lock, Stock'' cast, in new roles. And the actors hope the
next flick will be as fun as making this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like being in a pub,'' Statham says. ``We stood around
playing cards, telling jokes. There were hardly any serious
moments, apart from when the cameras were running.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole team was young and sort of thrilled by what they
were doing,'' Flemyng says. ``It was a break for everyone, so there
was a great feeling of sort of excitement all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Statham laughs: ``And a lot of testosterone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nick Moran, Jason Flemyng and Jason Statham. Directed
by Guy Ritchie. Rated R for language and violence. 1 hour, 46
minutes.

 &HT;    A teen takeover at the box office is undeniable, with a flood of
flicks targeting a `younger, hipper, smarter,' generation of movie
lovers
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most frightening things about '90s teenagers _ at least as
far as many adults were concerned _ used to be the music they
listened to and the body parts they pierced. Times have changed.
Suddenly, Marilyn Manson and nipple rings seem downright quaint
compared with the scary way teens have taken over Hollywood's box
office. It's a trend that's quickly turning anyone over 21 into
human Betamaxes: Movies simply don't fit them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the evidence: Beginning in mid-January, two teen
movies,``Varsity Blues'' and ``She's All That,'' alternated as No.
1 and 2 at the box office for three consecutive weeks, vanquishing
such ``geezer'' flicks as Robin Williams' ``Patch Adams'' and John
Travolta's ``A Civil Action.''
</P>
<P>
   That was only the beginning of the onslaught. ``Cruel
Intentions,'' which opened Friday, had such teen buzz that a TV
series pilot is already in development. The throes-of-puberty
remake of ``Dangerous Liaisons'' is but one of nearly a dozen
``teen'' movies being released before Memorial Day (``teen'' being
loosely defined as being about or for high schoolers).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our audience is getting younger, hipper, smarter and more
interested in movies,'' Walt Disney Studios Chairman Joe Roth said.
``So we're aiming for this new generation of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Theories abound about why this is happening now, ranging from
the population explosion of baby boomers' kids (at 60 million, it's
a group three times the size of Generation X) to the need for quick
entertainment fixes among this Internet-savvy, video-weaned group.
Then there's the ascendancy of such teen-oriented TV shows as
``Dawson's Creek'' (the star of ``Varsity Blues'' is Dawson
himself, James Van Der Beek), ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' (Sarah
Michelle Gellar, a.k.a. ``Buffy,'' stars in ``Cruel Intentions'')
and ``Party of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   But let's not forget about ``Titanic.'' Clearly, many
moviemakers looked at its record 15 straight weeks at No. 1 and
$600 million in earnings, largely due to teenage girls going back
for second, third and fourth viewings, and decided to jump on board
before they completely missed the boat.
</P>
<P>
   The teen movie trend, however, may actually have begun well
before Leonardo DiCaprio went eyeball-to-eyeball with that iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people credit `Titanic' as (being) the thing that
really opened people's eyes, but I think it was really `Clueless'
that started it,'' Isabel Walcott, founder and president of the
teen-attuned SmartGirl Internette Inc., said recently of the 1995
movie about a rich, socially savvy high schooler. ``That was such a
hit with teen girls, I think it opened people's eyes to the fact
that if they could get teenage girls especially to come to a movie,
they could make a killing.''
</P>
<P>
   But sixty killings?! Reportedly, that's how many high
school-themed films may be coming to a theater near you this year.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month alone brings ``Go,'' starring ``Dawson's Creek''
cutie Katie Holmes in a series of misadventures in Los Angeles'
underground scene. ``Scream'' star Drew Barrymore plays an adult
nerd who goes back to high school in ``Never Been Kissed,'' and
Julia Stiles (late of the TV miniseries ``The '60s'') stars in ``10
Things I Hate About You,'' a high school-based version of
Shakespeare's ``The Taming of the Shrew.'' Coming in October, ``O''
is a teenage version of another Shakespeare classic, ``Othello.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, it's ``Dawson'' cast member Michelle Williams' turn in
``Dick,'' about a pair of teenage girls (Kirsten Dunst co-stars)
lost during a tour of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Further down the pike, ``Killing Mrs. Tingle,'' again stars
Holmes in a high school story from Kevin ``Scream'' Williamson, and
on Dec. 10, expect to see ``Party of Five's'' Neve Campbell back in
``Scream 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so many successful movie genres, the films all may seem
somewhat familiar, even exactly alike in some cases. They also
might seem somewhat foreign to anyone over 21. So, herewith a
simple guide to the movies taking over your multiplex:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The names
</P>
<P>
   They come in threes: Besides Sarah Michelle Gellar, there's
Rachael Leigh Cook (``She's All That'') and the ubiquitous Jennifer
Love Hewitt (``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,'' ``Party of
Five''). Acceptable exceptions to this rule: Neve and Drew
(Campbell and Barrymore, of the ``Scream'' movies and the upcoming
``Never Been Kissed,'' respectively.) Or they come shortened into
cool nicknames: Usually, they are based on the character of the
actor's hit TV show. Gellar, for instance, is often referred to as
``Buffy'' (``Hey, there's Buffy!'' one teen nudged another at a
recent Atlanta showing of a movie where Gellar has a cameo.) Joshua
Jackson (``Urban Legend,'' ``Cruel Intentions'') is known as
``Pacey,'' because that's who he plays on ``Dawson's Creek.''
Acceptable exception: Hewitt, who likes to be known as _ who can
blame her? _ ``Love.'' Unacceptable exceptions: ``Mom'' or ``Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The hit TV shows
</P>
<P>
   The smaller the network's actual audience, the better (Hint:
Stay away from anything with nightly news broadcasts). WB may only
have several million, almost uniformly teenage viewers, but make a
movie with a ``Dawson'' or a ``Buffy'' star in it and they're there
at least once. (Lovett School senior Spencer Hux didn't like
``Varsity Blues,'' but he saw it anyway. Twice.) Acceptable
exception: Having a hit show on Fox (home of teen-themers ``Party
of Five'' and ``That '70s Show''). It's older and more successful
but still acceptably news- and viewer-lite.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The importance of staying in school
</P>
<P>
   High school, that is. ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' did
way better than its sequel, ``I Still Know What You Did Last
Summer,'' where the characters had finally hit college. Need more
proof? Gellar played a virtual senior citizen (21) in last month's
``Simply Irresistible,'' and it bombed. Van Der Beek played a
senior in ``Varsity Blues,'' and it hit No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The right look
</P>
<P>
   When a teen star appears to have lost interest halfway through
the hair grooming process (or just like a foreign exchange student
20 years ago), it's exactly right. For girls, this means a zigzaggy
part down the middle of their straight, straight hair. For guys,
this means dying their artfully tousled hair pltinum, but only on
the top, so plenty of black shows through. Unacceptable exception:
Van Der Beek reversed the process in ``Varsity Blues,'' dying his
platinum hair black. The result was nearly as sloppy as his
Texas-by-way-of-Connecticut ``drawl.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The right wheels
</P>
<P>
   Teens in movies drive Jeeps. Or they don't drive at all.
Acceptable exception: Borrowing someone else's Jeep and driving it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The friends
</P>
<P>
   The teenage pop star: Grammy winner Brandy played the hippest
(and therefore the unlikeliest) roommate for Hewitt's mopey, serial
murderer stalkee of a character in ``I Still Know What You Did Last
Summer.'' And the high school in ``She's All That'' apparently had
no teachers but did have a complete radio studio, so Grammy nominee
Usher could play the role of just your typical student-DJ.
Acceptable exception: Rapper-actor Will Smith (``Men in Black'') is
30 and the top-ranked celebrity on SmartGirl's latest Internet
survey of mostly teen users.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The racial mix
</P>
<P>
   It's arguably the most welcome aspect of the teen movie glut.
Nearly all the casts are integrated, and no one seems to feel the
need to explain why black and white kids are hanging out together,
even living together. In ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,''
Brandy was Hewitt's friend and onscreen equal (if truth be told,
she was more than her equal, showing more smarts and acting chops)
and has already signed on for the sequel's sequel. Usher was
probably the best-known teen in ``The Faculty,'' and ``She's All
That'' showed groups of white and black kids partying and going to
the beach together. Unacceptable exception: ``Scream 2'' integrated
its cast with African-American actress Jada Pinkett Smith, then
promptly killed her off. Of course, minutes later, they also killed
off Gellar.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The adults
</P>
<P>
   Uh, what adults? Grown-ups not only don't matter in these
movies, they almost don't exist. Most of the parents in ``Scream''
are either horribly murdered or off on extended business trips.
``Varsity Blues'' does have several significant adult roles, the
mean football coach and the nice teacher by day/sexy stripper by
night. Guess which one doesn't come to a horrible end? Acceptable
exception: Drew Barrymore in the upcoming ``Never Been Kissed'' is
an adult working as a newspaper copy editor who realizes the error
of her ways and goes back to being a high schooler. Unacceptable
exception: ``The Faculty'' was set in a high school, but all the
juicy roles (i.e., the aliens masquerading as teachers) went to
adults. It didn't exactly burn up the box office.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The in jokes and sly references to other teen stars
</P>
<P>
   ``Sly'' meaning you never explain them and ``in'' meaning no
adult without a serious WB habit actually gets them. Otherwise,
it's just not funny when Gellar appears fleetingly _ unbilled and
without uttering a single word _ in a high school cafeteria scene
in ``She's All That.'' Nor when Joshua Jackson's character starts
his car in ``Urban Legend'' and grimaces when the radio blares out
part of the Top 40 song that also serves as the opening theme of
his TV show, ``Dawson's Creek.'' Acceptable exception: The
``Friends'' jokes in ``Scream,'' because Courteney Cox stars in
both. Unacceptable exception: The Chelsea Clinton reference in
``She's All That.'' Not because she's not a teen star of sorts, but
because adults in the audience would actually know who she is.

 &HT;    `Analyze This' as gangster angst
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the lead-pipe world of gangster Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro),
the deepest kind of communication goes something like this: ``Did
you talk to that guy about the thing?'' More comfortable expressing
his feelings with a bullet, Paul is not a natural candidate for
psychotherapy. But in ``Analyze This,'' the shiny-suited mobster
winds up in the bland suburban office of Ben Sobol (Billy Crystal),
a nebbishy psychiatrist whose clients run toward long-marrieds
bored with their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for a meeting of New York's rival mob families, Paul
has had trouble sleeping. And breathing. He'd rather think it's
heart trouble than his doctor's diagnosis: a sissy-sounding ``panic
attack.'' That's what leads him to demand some quality shrink time
with Ben. Or else. Of course, the good doctor has to face the moral
quandary of helping Paul become ``a happy, well-adjusted
gangster.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ben's on his way to Miami to marry Laura (Lisa
Kudrow), a TV newscaster. The last thing she expects is having to
share Ben with the needy and demanding Paul as both big days
approach: the wedding and the mob family meeting. (Kudrow's small
role verges on two-dimensional nag, but she can make the stalest
material seem fresh.)
</P>
<P>
   Harold Ramis (``Groundhog Day'') directs with a sleek
professionalism exemplified by the honey-toned camera work of
Stuart Dryburgh (``Portrait of a Lady''). It's all easy on the eye
and pleasant enough. But it won't surprise you. You get mob jokes,
therapy jokes and parodies of scenes from ``The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   The script, by Ramis and three others, is a farce with a
structure reminiscent of ``La Cage aux Folles.'' Here, mob life
replaces gay identity as the closeted danger that threatens to
derail a wedding. In ``La Cage,'' news reporters added heat to the
situation; here we get undercover agents keeping Paul and then Ben
under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   And like ``La Cage'' (the American remake, not the nuttier
French original), ``Analyze This'' never really reaches the
breathless giddiness you want from a farce. That may be because of
the subject matter. The movie has lots of gunfire and falling
bodies. It never quite reconciles its bullets and its belly laughs.
It wants to be a gangster comedy, but a nice gangster comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also can't figure out whether it's making fun of
psychiatry or endorsing it. In a climactic scene, Paul uncovers a
suppressed memory of his father's death. Sure, it gives De Niro
something meaty to play, but it seems like a weird digression in
the middle of the comedy.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps the movie clicking is Crystal and De Niro's
consummate interplay, the comic collision of Crystal's righteous
indignation against the brick wall of De Niro's tough-guy sarcasm.
They're what makes the picture work. Paul's disgust on learning
what an Oedipal complex means is terrific, not because the material
is fresh (it's decades old), but because De Niro sells the scene.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, ``Analyze This'' lets him prove he can pull off
comedy, even if he isn't any threat to Robin Williams. Or, for that
matter, Crystal.
</P>
<P>
   As for Crystal, maybe this is his official way of apologizing
for ``My Giant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyze This''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal and Lisa Kudrow. Rated R
for language, a scene of sexuality and some violence. At metro
theaters. 1 hour, 46 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An agreeable farce propelled mainly by its two
consummately professional leads.

 &HT;    `General' is grudging Irish salute
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been 12 years since the glory days of ``Hope and Glory,''
the movie that earned John Boorman the Oscar nominations for best
picture, director and original screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Boorman is back in fine form _ and finer fettle _ with ``The
General,'' a cocksure character study of celebrated Irish criminal
Martin Cahill. It copped Boorman the best-director prize at Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins with Cahill's death in 1994. He's gunned down
by an assailant in front of his home. This is a bit suspicious,
because Cahill's neighborhood usually was crawling with cops. (He
was under 24-hour police surveillance.)
</P>
<P>
   Further, the news of the death of The General _ his nickname _
draws cheers at the nearby precinct, with congratulations extended
to the Javert-like inspector (Jon Voight) who had dogged him for
years. One senses that the cops didn't exactly pull the trigger but
that their hands were near the gun assumed to have been wielded by
the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the film is essentially a flashback, beginning with
his childhood as an irrepressible petty thief (played by Eamonn
Owens of ``The Butcher Boy'') pinching rolls for his starving
family _ plus a prized pack of ciggies for his ma.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, Cahill (Brendan Gleeson) becomes a folk hero of
sorts in Dublin, known for his roguish ways and daring robberies.
Cahill will steal anything that catches his fancy, from a gold
record to a Vermeer painting. But, as Boorman never lets us forget,
he mostly steals out of good old-fashioned greed.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, he's a teddy bear of a man, the sort of
good-ol-boy bloke you'd want to raise a few with at the pub. But
Cahill was more complicated than that. He was a natural contrarian,
with no respect for the police, the church, the politicians or even
the much-feared IRA. When he and his gang knock over a jewelry
store considered so impregnable that the IRA won't tackle it,
Cahill refuses the terrorist organization's demand that he share
the loot, thus making a particularly deadly enemy.
</P>
<P>
   But that's who this man is: an equal-opportunity
anti-authoritarian. For him, the IRA isn't any different from the
cops. And that cheeky individualism is what ultimately does him in.
</P>
<P>
   Boorman is clearly enthralled by Cahill. That's the director's
gold record _ given him by the record industry for boosting the
sales of ``Dueling Banjos'' with his movie ``Deliverance'' _ that
Cahill makes off with (it happened in real life). But Boorman and
his star refuse to romanticize this gangster-rebel. Gleeson, with
his stocky build and soccer-thug eyes, plays Cahill with a
disarming child-man spark. He's a true eccentric. For instance, his
close-knit extended family consists of children with both his wife
(Maria Doyle Kennedy) and her younger sister (Angeline Ball).
</P>
<P>
   Yet underneath the hearty geniality lies a vicious streak that
erupts with chilling intensity. A gang member who he believes has
crossed him ends up crucified on a pool table (but it's also Cahill
who then rushes him to a hospital). He's like an overgrown, lovable
puppy who can suddenly turn on you.
</P>
<P>
   Boorman has shot the film in sparkling black and white, harking
back to his early days in the mid-1960s when he did such kicky
flicks as ``Catch Me if You Can'' and the cult classic ``Point
Blank.'' He clearly knows he has a terrific tale, and he has a
terrific time telling it. It's like being joined by a pal over a
few beers who starts out with, ``Wait'll you hear what this guy did
next.''
</P>
<P>
   But again, under the games and goofs, Boorman is examining a
complex inevitability. Men like Cahill typically end up worn down
by the constant harassment they've invited from the authorities.
More typically still, they end up with a bullet in their head.
</P>
<P>
   The point, one guesses, is that a life like this is better
witnessed than lived. No wonder ``The General'' leaves an
aftertaste that's rollicking but also oddly poignant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The General''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Gleeson. Directed by John Boorman. Rated R for
language and violence. 3 hours, 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An entertaining true-life tale of an Irish master
thief who was both lovable rogue and ugly thug.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: FEDS SEEK TO PART THE DIGITAL WATERS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Mar. 7.
 &HT;    Moving in commentary (k) and business (f) queues.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON When our family goes off on vacation, we leave the
house keys with the neighbors, just in case something goes awry.
</P>
<P>
   For people who communicate on the Internet, encryption programs
are the ``house keys'' to security in the Information Age. These
programs scramble data into unreadable globs, insuring privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Encryption strength is measured in bits: the more bits, the
harder it is to crack the code. It's best to use a Web browser with
128-bit technology. Without such an industrial-strength browser,
neither my online bank nor my online broker will let me access my
files.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the administration limited U.S. firms seeking to
communicate with their foreign suppliers or customers to low-power
40-bit encryption programs, so the government could break the code.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, federal agencies raised the ceiling to 56 bits.
Government flacks issued press releases lauding their masters for
having taken such a gracious step. Attorney General Janet Reno
pleaded with business leaders to recognize that terrorists and
criminals also use the e-mails and must be watched.
</P>
<P>
   But they told her that they needed still more security to do
business overseas. So the feds said if you want to use something
stronger than 56 bits, then you'll have to incorporate ``key
recovery'' features into your encryption programs.
</P>
<P>
   That's the cyberspace equivalent of leaving the family house
keys behind -- with the feds as the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   If the White House has its way, these ``keys'' will be stored in
massive central databases that cops can access under a court order.
It's really no different, Reno says, than the wiretap laws now on
the books that help the FBI catch spies and drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the government argues, 56-bit keys should suffice. They
offer only one chance in 72,057,594,037,927,936 of breaking a code.
If each of these quadrillion-plus numbers were to be checked at a
rate of one per second, it would take 9 billion years to work
through the entire code set.
</P>
<P>
   In January, RSA Data Security, a software firm, offered $10,000
to the first group that could break its 56-bit encryption program.
It took a couple of hackers only 22 hours to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   So in February, RSA set up shop in Australia to market 128-bit
programs. Nobody notified Janet Reno about the loss of U.S. jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it would faze her. The attorney general hopes Congress
will pass a law that, in effect, orders anyone who does business
with the government to deposit a set of digital ``house keys.'' It
would be only a matter of time before such rules rippled through
the whole business world.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh points out that if Ramzi Yousef --
convicted of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing -- had used strong
encryption in his computer files, then his other murderous plans
might never have been known. If we can't decode it, Freeh argues,
then you shouldn't be using it.
</P>
<P>
   But the flow of cyberspace can't be turned off. And Freeh is no
Moses: he can't part the digital waters. In the long run, any
attempt to impose ``key recovery'' won't work. In the short run,
however, such efforts could cause an unholy mess by stifling
commerce and retarding the Internet's growth.

The Rev. Henry Lyons was accused of depositing at least $60,000
into his personal checking account. A South Carolina pastor who
prayed with President Clinton over the fires was accused by his
congregation of misappropriating some of it. But a lot of the
money, indeed, rebuilt churches. Meanwhile, the National Task Force
on Church Fires says the number of church fires has steadily

 &HT;    CONGRESSIONAL PANELS OKAY NURSING HOME PROTECTION
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two congressional panels approved bills Thursday
that would prevent nursing homes from discharging Medicaid patients
if the homes drop out of the Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicaid patients in a nursing home can't be forced to leave
because the home made a voluntary decision to withdraw from the
Medicaid program,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., the bill's Senate
sponsor, moments after it breezed through the Senate Finance
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour later, a House Commerce subcommittee passed a
similar bill sponsored by Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., chairman
of the health and environment subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nursing home residents and their families will not have to
live with the fear of eviction,'' Bilirakis said. ``Enactment of
this legislation will remove that threat.''
</P>
<P>
   To become law, the House and Senate would have to be approve
identical versions of the bill and the president would have to sign
it.
</P>
<P>
   The bills approved Thursday would cover instances in which a
nursing home that formerly accepted Medicaid patients decided to
drop out of the program. Medicaid patients already in the home
would be allowed to remain, and their costs would continue to be
paid by the program.
</P>
<P>
   People who enter non-Medicaid homes as private patients would
have to be given written notice that if they became Medicaid
patients they would no longer be allowed to remain in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said he planned to offer an amendment
when the bill reaches the full Commerce Committee that would exempt
homes from the new rules in states that cut their Medicaid payment
rates in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``No new nursing homes are going to be built for Medicaid
patients'' if the bills become law, Coburn said.
</P>
<P>
   The bills grew out of a situation last year in which Vencor
Inc., one of the nation's largest nursing homes, attempted to evict
Medicaid patients in Florida and Indiana after it homes decided to
drop out of the program. The company reversed its efforts after
complaints were raised publicly. The company and the industry have
endorsed the Graham and Bilirakis bills.
</P>
<P>
   In another action Thursday, the Senate Finance Committee voted
18-2 to extend the limits on Medicaid and Medicare benefits for
disabled people who return to work.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which has 62 co-sponsors, would allow states to lift
the income eligibility cap for disabled Medicaid beneficiaries who
return to work. Currently the cap is 250 percent of the poverty
level. States would be allowed to set their own threshold above
that amount.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bill would extend Medicare coverage for
disabled workers who return to work from the current three years to
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, however, the two committee votes against the bill
were from Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate
Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla. There opposition could delay
consideration of the bill by the full Senate.

   CHENOWETH-THEATER (New York) _ In a Broadway season packed with
Electra, the Lomans and other gloomy characters, the true master of
existential angst just may be a 5-year-old cartoon malcontent by
the name of Sally Brown. ``I was jumping rope, everything seemed
fine,'' says Sally, in a martini-dry deadpan. ``And suddenly, it
all seemed so futile.'' The actress responsible for Sally's
delectable depression is Kristen Chenoweth, a diminutive

reviews as Charlie Brown's kid sister in the revival of ``You're a

LONGING FOR THE INVASION OF THE BARBIE SNATCHERS

 (For release Sunday, March 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ I love my two girls. And they love Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't easy for me to admit; I'm no fan of the woman. Fate
forces me to accept that Barbie shares our home with us, that our
lives are filled with Barbie dolls and Barbie-related
paraphernalia: Barbie vehicles (a car; a bike), Barbie combs and
brushes, Barbie shoes (which, for the record, stay on Barbie feet
12.8 seconds before dislodging and becoming lost), Barbie socks and
Barbie microdresses, all of them pink.
</P>
<P>
   Add to these the numerous items emblazoned with Barbie's
doe-eyed visage _ pajamas, barrettes, puzzles, tea sets, coloring
books, jewelry _ and the end sum is a lot of plastic femininity.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always so. When my 5-year-old, Madeleine, was born, I
vowed that Barbie dolls would never Darken Our Door. Madeleine
would never play with one; I would never buy her one; Barbie's
pole-vault legs and petroleum bouffant would never come between us.
Barbie, I believed, provides an unrealistic model of feminine
beauty: She's a negative influence on the psyches of young girls,
damaging their body images and emphasizing artifice over
accomplishment. No bubble-headed Barbie for my baby girl. No way.
</P>
<P>
   Then somebody gave her one. The occasion was her second birthday
party, and the giver _ a ringleted, sweetly poised 2 1/2-year-old _
was Madeleine's best friend. My first impulse was to scream ``DEMON
BARBIE!!! AGGGGGHHH!!!!'' and propel the doll over the heads of
several guests into a burning fire. But etiquette demanded
otherwise. So I smiled at the 2 1/2-year-old and thanked her mother
(a friend of mine), all the while devising a secret post-party
Barbie-disposal plan.
</P>
<P>
   First, I would wait until Madeleine had set aside the dreaded
Barbie. I would stash it in some remote corner of the house, out of
sight and out of reach. Eventually, maybe after a week, maybe after
a month, she would forget about it. And as soon as she forgot about
it, I would throw it out. Poof. End of Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   Except she never forgot about it. The Barbie-disposal plan never
had a chance. No sooner had I stuffed Barbie into some dank recess,
Madeleine asked to play with her. After which Mother was faced with
a harsh dilemma: Lie to a 2-year-old? (``Barbie's lost, honey.'')
Be brutally honest? (``Barbie's an evil contortion of the human
body, and I forbid you to play with her.'') Or act like millions of
mothers since the dawn of bendable playthings, and cave in?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: Cave in.
</P>
<P>
   When my daughter Jeanne was born, and all heck broke loose. One
of the hard-and-fast rules of parenting is that Child No. 2 does
not play with baby toys. Child No. 2 plays with whatever mess Child
No. 1 has left on the living room floor. When the mess consists of
serrated edges and objects fit for lodging in windpipes, Mom clears
it away before baby gets there. But when the mess consists of
Barbie dolls, none of which (despite their other negative aspects)
has ever boasted a serrated edge, Mom leaves it alone and wanders
off to extract crayons from the kitchen drain instead. It's a
matter of prioritizing.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is a complicated way of saying that I was, by then,
too exhausted to object. Barbie was a Fact. And once she became a
Fact, I relaxed my defenses. I bought Barbie sleepwear, necklaces,
tchotchkes. Eventually I bought a doll myself: an African-American
model, which I outfitted with a big pink Barbie mountain bike and
bundled up for Madeleine's fifth birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Because the girls had always been fans of so-called ``boy''
stuff, their interest in the frillier realm of doll collecting
seemed like a fair balance. Barbie was bland, Barbie was
unrealistic, Barbie was bizarre but she was no more bland,
unrealistic or bizarre than Barney, another iconic oddball I've
come to terms with. Her feet may be deformed (how high are those
heels, anyway?) and her eyelashes thick with mascara, but at least
she doesn't have a show on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   The body-image problem still bugs me, however. I've talked to
the girls repeatedly about the inherent weirdness of Barbie's
figure _ ``Real women don't look like that,'' I say, whereupon they
give me a look that's best translated as: Duh.
</P>
<P>
   They knew that already. But it's my job, as their mother, to
state the obvious: To tell them that they're beautiful the way they
are, that it's good to be strong and healthy and solid, that no one
on God's green Earth has legs that start at their earlobes.

WATER-RICH CANADA WARY OF THIRSTY US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Budgeted photo is unavailable.)  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Canada holds a fifth of the world's fresh water
supply, but doesn't want to share a drop, at least not for now. And
especially not with its increasingly thirsty neighbor to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated as much by raw nationalism as environmentalism, and
with an eye toward one day becoming the OPEC of H(2)O, Canada is
seeking to ban bulk sales of water to foreigners _ the first
``water-rich'' nation to attempt to block the flow of a resource
that some specialists predict will become the most valuable
commodity of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   With little fanfare and less public debate, Parliament last
month voted unanimously for a moratorium on bulk exports of water,
cloaking its action in Queen and flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water is as Canadian as hockey, as the Mounties, as the
beaver,'' said Bill Blaikie, a member of Parliament from Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   Said International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi: ``Canadians
feel extremely passionate about water.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it seemed a curious move for a country whose economy
depends heavily on extracting and exporting fabulous quantities of
non-renewable resources, from gold to natural gas. No one one seems
to worry too much about reserves of Canadian oil or iron ore, but
water gets the blood pumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't drink oil,'' explained Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's water, of course, is a resource that each hour
replenishes itself by the billions of gallons. Every day, the St.
Lawrence River alone disgorges into the Atlantic the equivalent of
10.1 million railroad tanker car loads of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   The vote by Parliament, although scarcely noticed outside
Ottawa, may turn out to have been the starting gun in a new global
scramble for resources.
</P>
<P>
   As the millenium approaches, the world's thirst for water is
growing at a stunning rate, with global demand doubling every 21
years. By the year 2025, the World Bank predicts, more than 3
billion people in 52 countries will suffer from chronic shortages
in water for drinking or sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   Even rich countries may be forced to reduce consumption
drastically _ especially agricultural use _ or search outside their
boundaries for sources of the life-giving liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Canada's extraordinary wealth of water, many
observers say the new moratorium is just a temporary stopgap,
giving Ottawa and the provinces time to devise a coherent water
policy _ and pricing strategy _ before opening the resource to the
highest bidders. They say Canada is less interested in keeping
water permanently away from bulk buyers than devising a plan to
circumvent the North American Free Trade Agreement and ensure that
Canadian companies _ not avaricious Americans _ profit most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada is a future OPEC of water,'' said Terence Corcoran,
business editor of the National Post, a Toronto-based daily
newspaper known for sober-minded financial coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Canada may even be moving on US water: a Canadian company has
quietly won the first North American license to ship bulk
quantities of drinking water to China _ from a pristine lake in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Global Water Corporation of Vancouver, British Columbia, in
a precedent-setting deal that attracted surprisingly little
attention, plans to siphon 18.2 billion gallons a year from Blue
Lake near Sitka, Alaska, for shipment to bottling plants in China,
one of the countries most threatened by looming shortages.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 report to shareholders, Global Water noted that
``consumption of water products is growing at a rate faster than
any beverage product.''
</P>
<P>
   Among environmentalists and economists, there is widespread
agreement that water shortages will become commonplace in the
coming decades, and that countries that control fresh water will be
kings of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 2010, Canada will be exporting large quantities of fresh
water to the US, and more by tanker to parched nations all over the
globe,'' Corcoran wrote in a recent article. ``The issue will not
be whether to export, but how much money the federal government and
the provinces will be able to extract from the shipments.''
</P>
<P>
   A study by the World Bank recently forecast that the planet's
rapidly expanding population will drain lakes and mighty rivers,
causing calamitous shortages of water for irrigation, drinking, and
sanitation. Water is being pumped at dangerous rates from exhausted
underground aquifiers throughout Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and
even parts of the United States, such as southern California and
several Midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for dwindling shares of the resource is already
intense, and could become ferocious. Stated the World Bank: ``Wars
of the next century will be over water.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's water moratorium, which has yet to be tested under free
trade treaties like NAFTA, is aimed straight at the United States,
where several businesses are quietly hatching plans to siphon off
shiploads of water from Canadian lakes for delivery to dusty
agricultural lands in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect has plainly spooked Canada. Politicians there vow
to protect the resource as nationalists thump up anti-American
sentiment by suggesting that their nation's pristine lakes and
rivers are about to be sucked dry by greedy US agribusiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing freaks out Canadians like the idea of American
supertankers coming in and taking off our water,'' said Maude
Barlow, head of the Council of Canadians, a nationalist lobbying
group that believes free trade treaties have left Canada vulnerable
to economic rape by its powerful neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water is our lifeblood,'' said Barlow, who favors a flat ban
on bulk water exports, except for humanitarian shipments. ``Once
the tap is open, no one can turn it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa is urging the 10 provinces, which share control of water
with the federal government, to help devise forceful strategies for
better guarding the nation's hoard.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the hullabaloo over water comes at a time of year
when Canadians from Niagara Falls to the high Arctic are hip deep
in the stuff, in the form of snow. Canada posseses the simple
compound of hydrogen and oxygen in more staggering abundance than
any other nation. Scientists estimate that 20 percent of the
earth's entire bounty of fresh water lies untouched in this country
of only 30 million people. Much of Canada remains virgin
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   A bit less than half of Canada's fresh water is renewable and,
at least theoretically, accessible from rivers, lakes, and
underground flows. The rest is so-called ``fossil water,'' locked
in glaciers and the permanent ice shield that covers the far north.
</P>
<P>
   On a per capita basis, Canada boasts 11 times as much renewable
fresh water as the United States: about 28.7 million gallons for
every woman, man, and child, compared to 2.6 million gallons per
American, according to UN figures.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens of the two countries are by far the world's most
prolifigate users of water, consuming 100 gallons per day per
person (Canada's average is slightly lower) _ most of it flushed
down the toilet or bath drain. The average person drinks only about
2 quarts per day.
</P>
<P>
   American/Canadian household consumption is nearly three times
higher than the European average, and 25 times greater than
personal consumption in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in rich and poor countries alike, water quaffed from
drinking glass or drawn into the bath is but a drop compared to the
stupefying amounts lavished on crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irrigation is far and away the biggest consumer of water
worldwide, accounting for about 80 percent of use,'' said Sandra
Postel, director of the Global Water Policy Project, a research
group based in Amherst, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, the most obvious new source is Canada,
which uses only the tiniest fraction of its available water to
slake its thirst, water its crops and turn the turbines of its
mammoth hydroelectric dams.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies clamoring for access to the water wealth of
the northern neighbor is Sun Belt Water Inc. of Santa Barbara,
which during the mid-1990s sought the right to ship tanker loads of
water from British Columbia to California. British Columbia killed
the deal and imposed a provincewide ban on bulk water exports. Sun
Belt is now seeking compensation of $220 million from Canada,
claiming the ban violates NAFTA, the free trade pact signed by the
United States, Canada, and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Trade specialists say that if Canada permits even a single
shipload of water to be exported, water will automatically become a
``tradeable commodity'' under NAFTA. That means US companies would
legally have the same rights as Canadian firms to exploit and
export the resource.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadian water would come under as much pressure as Canadian
culture is already under from the American juggernaut,'' warned
Barlow.

 &HT;    Potential adversaries agree: We can afford cleaner air
 &HT;    By John Young

<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ In their respective environments, Texans,
politicians and political activists each can be cited for emissions
of ``toxic overstatement'' _ sometimes referred to as ``bovine
biomass.''
</P>
<P>
   But, no bull. This is big.
</P>
<P>
   It's particularly big since the politicians we are about to cite
are Texas Republicans and the activists are Texas
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   This week Waco's state Sen. David Sibley, and by assent Gov.
George W. Bush, said they would link electric deregulation with a
major cleanup of electric utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley, the power center of electric deregulation, said Monday
he would amend his deregulation bill to include what would be a
barely noticeable increase in utility bills _ less than a dollar a
month for most residential customers _ to pay for utilities to add
pollution devices that cut emissions of nitrogen oxides by up to 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   That pollutant is a key factor in the visible ozone that turns
skies from blue to milky. This initiative would achieve with one
fell swoop a long-delayed environmental gain.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Carman, the clean-air program director of the Lone Star
Sierra Club, calls Sibley's proposal ``a major leap forward.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush, he wouldn't mind being able to say he'd be the
``environmental president'' his father pledged to be (for ``bovine
biomass,'' see above). Sibley, a close ally, would appear to have
handed George W. a certifiably environment-friendly initiative to
tout on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental activists who a decade ago simply might have
thrown themselves on the railroad tracks before a
Republican-sponsored electric deregulation bill this time decided
to try and get what they could in the face of the inevitable. Not
for the first time, they've found in Sibley a listener and a doer.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with poll numbers showing most Texans would support paying
a little more for cleaner air, they came forth with a plea to
incorporate into electric deregulation a cleanup plan for too-dirty
grandfathered electric plants _ those in place before and not
subject to the Texas Clean Air Act of 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates rubbed their eyes this week when they realized
that Sibley's $1.4 billion initiative not only would pay for new
controls at grandfathered plants but at all utilities in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Smith of the public-interest advocacy group Public Citizen
calls this investment a Texas-sized bargain. It would achieve ozone
reduction at a third of what it would cost to make a comparable
reduction in automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   It can be done
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism is well in order over what might derive to the common
man from electric deregulation. Indeed, it may offer little more
than confusion to many. But if in fact it is inevitable, with
federal deregulation coming down the track, a clean-air initiative
is a most wise and savvy seizing of the day for environmentalists.
And they have a conservative Republican to thank for the daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen's Smith sees this as a landmark move that could
make other steps to clean up pollution politically palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has been frozen in indecision about what to do about
cleaning up old power plants, with the specter of their retirement
seemingly looming.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley's proposal, said Smith, might enable lawmakers to look
further at dealing with other air pollution issues rather than
waiting for the sooty, suffocating end of time.
</P>
<P>
   Smith sees hope that Texans, and Texas politicians, if fully
informed about the pollution coming from power plants and the costs
of cleanup, could ``go the whole enchilada, the whole deal'' _ to
curb emissions of visible particulates and deadly metals like
mercury that get spread with the breeze from coal-fired generators.
</P>
<P>
   That would be big.

FLEDGLING FILMMAKERS TRAVEL TO HELL AND BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE BARNES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ John Holser knows about hell.
</P>
<P>
   There is one.
</P>
<P>
   It's a town halfway across Wyoming, goes by the name of Rawlins
and is cold. A woman named Mirinda works in a truck stop there.
</P>
<P>
   You want Mirinda fixing your ailing Winnebago about as much as
you want Marilyn Manson reading bedtime stories to your children.
</P>
<P>
   John Holser didn't have a choice. The 38-year-old filmmaker from
Averill Park, N.Y., and a pair of movie-buff friends _ Mike Camoin,
33, and Robin Nagengast, 31 _ were already a few days behind
schedule. It was late January, and they still had to get to Park
City, Utah, in time for the Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The Winnebago _ a 27-foot Brave, built in 1982 _ had wheezed
into an exhausted collapse a few miles outside of Rawlins and
required a tow to the second repair shop. Earlier, back in Laramie,
they came down a steep mountain pass, in a nighttime blizzard, with
an ailing alternator. To keep the RPMs up, Holser, who was driving,
put the RV in neutral, goosed the engine with his right foot and
stepped gently on the brake with his left. He had to keep the
engine roaring, because if the revs dropped, the already-weak
headlamps would further dim and the windshield wipers would sweep
across their arc even more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   A garage in Laramie had temporarily fixed the alternator. It
lasted halfway across the state, almost until Rawlins.
</P>
<P>
   In Rawlins, Mirinda rendered her verdict: bad injectors and an
alternator beyond revivification. This was after, back about
mid-Kansas, they'd already had to replace an engine belt and the
fuel filters. Now they were only one state away from Sundance, and
the celebrated film festival was going on without them.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Holser and crew had been invited. They were going to
crash Sundance.
</P>
<P>
   Holser directs films and corporate videos. He's currently
working on a documentary titled ``Lights, Camera &AMP; Credit Cards,''
about the making of seven independent films, and he runs a Web site
about independent films. Nagengast also makes movies, as does
Camoin. Camoin's documentary ``Inside the Blue Line: Leadley's
Legacy,'' is about a woodsman in the Adirondack Mountains. It was
accepted by the annual Cornell Environmental Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   But Sundance turned down Camoin's movie. Twice. Which was at
least part of the impetus for their whole cross-country expedition.
</P>
<P>
   The plan: Convert the RV into a mini screening room, complete
with theater seats and a 27-inch TV. ``It was jammin', like a
totally cool fort on wheels,'' says Holser. They named the
Winnebago Dances on Wheels and called it a ``mobile film venue''
the movie-theater version of a bookmobile.
</P>
<P>
   They would drive to Utah over two days. Park on the main street
of Park City. Hand out fliers advertising that they'd be showing 20
films, mostly shorts, none of which were accepted by Sundance. Pour
coffee and hot chocolate. Impress people, get noticed.
</P>
<P>
   The actuality: They decided to take a southerly route to avoid
snowstorms. The first blizzard hit in Delanson, N.Y. Then a bunch
more storms. Then the fuel filters got stopped up. And the
alternator went. Twice.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they got to Park City, five days after having left
New York and three days late, the Winnebago was flatulent with
smoke and leaking diesel. Nix on the downtown-parking plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided we couldn't do it,'' Holser says. ``We go to Main
Street, where people are hanging out, standing on the sidewalk,
smoking cigarettes. We're leaking fuel. Someone tosses a cigarette,
and that's it. Boom. We'd blow up the whole town.''
</P>
<P>
   They decided to set up elsewhere. Driving into a parking lot
with a steep ramp _ a parking lot full of people they wanted to
impress _ the Winnebago got stuck. Front wheels on the incline,
trailer hitch in the road, rear wheels off the ground, back end
blocking a lane and a half of Sundance traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe 20 people came to their sole showing, in a hotel room.
Then Nagengast flew to Albany. Camoin stayed on awhile to see
films. And Holser left town, hoping to nurse the RV back home.
</P>
<P>
   Total time in Park City: one day.
</P>
<P>
   Holser headed south to avoid the weather.
</P>
<P>
   And hit, in Texas, a Texas-size storm that immobilized most of
the state, including a 55-mile-long traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   And the Winnebago's transmission collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   A good mechanic fixed it. For $2,500. Included free: The news
that Mirinda and her Rawlins crew had put an engine belt on
backward, left a rag in the air filter and neglected to close the
valve that caused the fuel leakage.
</P>
<P>
   After the snow cleared and he got out of Texas, Holser drove
straight on home, Tulsa, Okla., to Albany in 21 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten days in a broken-down RV, you really learn who you are,''
Holser says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole film industry is really a marketing industry. ...
It's about getting your film and yourself noticed,'' says Camoin.
``At least people were talking about us.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip wasn't a complete flop. They had a video camera going
at the worst moments. They can make a documentary about their
disastrous journey. The RV, now running happily, will roll out to
colleges in the Northeast, probably in the fall. And they'll even
think about returning to Sundance next January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just won't drive through Rawlins,'' Camoin says.

CALIFORNIA WOMAN TELLS HOW SHE ESCAPED MASSACRE IN UGANDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Linda Adams went to Uganda in search of
gorillas. She found guerrillas, too.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, 52, a resident of Alamo, Calif., told how she escaped
from a band of Rwandan rebels who kidnapped her and 31 others
Monday in Uganda's Bwindi National Park. Fourteen of the captives
were marched into the mountains. Six were released and eight were
hacked to death with machetes.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the San Francisco Airport Wednesday, Adams said, ``I
wish all the hostages were free and alive. I grieve for those in
Oregon who lost their daughter, their father, their son.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to the deaths of Rob Haubner, 48, and his
wife, Susan Miller, 42, the only Americans among those murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was taken prisoner during a five-day visit to see the
celebrated mountain gorillas in the nearby mountains. She said she
had spotted some gorillas on a grueling high-altitude hike the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   It was on that trek that Adams developed respiratory problems
and was unable to keep up with the younger members of her group.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, inspired her to declare that she could not
breathe when her captors tried to march her back into the mountains
the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The climb was strenuous and I was just not going to go with
them,'' said Adams. A tour leader told the rebel commander that
Adams suffered from asthma (which she doesn't). That tour leader,
in turn, could not see beyond three feet without her glasses, Adams
said.
</P>
<P>
   So the rebel leader told the two to return to the camp, where
other guerrillas were holding other tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, said Adams, she and her companion hid in the brush for
45 minutes or longer before entering the camp. By then, the rebels
had departed.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said she didn't realize at first that an abduction was
taking place. When she emerged from her tent that morning, to be
greeted by ``four men with four guns,'' she assumed they were
gorilla poachers committing an armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle-toting men asked for her money, she said, adding that
``if they wanted the money they could have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   When she asked them to return her airplane ticket and passport,
which they had taken from her tent, the rebels politely complied,
she said. That made her feel safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been really nice to me, even though they captured us
at gunpoint,'' she recalled. ``I really felt there was some
compassion from their leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said she was probably released because ``I would have been
a burden to them.'' What's more, ``I am a female with gray hair and
I think they had some respect for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, she said, ``I don't know that I really realized I was
in danger. I was just not going to walk up the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Only when she returned to the camp did those left behind tell
Adams that the men with guns were political rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was informed that they had made demands,'' she said. ``It
took me by surprise. I thought maybe they were detaining us to keep
the Uganda police at bay for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said she would have been killed had she not exhibited
breathing difficulties. ``I know I would not be here today if I
didn't do that, because I was the oldest and I was the slowest,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her experience there, Adams said she would be willing to
return to Uganda. ``It's not the Ugandans who did this to me,'' she
noted. ``The countryside was beautiful.'' On earlier trips she has
tracked polar bears and seals in the wintry far north and flown to
Australia and the Galapagos Islands on nature expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   She said she feared that terrorism in the area of the endangered
mountain gorillas will further threaten their survival. In fact,
she said that when she heard distant shots before emerging from her
tent and meeting the rebels, ``my first reaction was, `I hope no
one is shooting the gorillas.'''

`LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS'': KEEPING THE THUGS IN
CONSTANT MOTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guy Ritchie's brash, ebullient direction of his first feature,
``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' makes it very obvious that
he honed his style making music videos and commercials.
</P>
<P>
   And for once that doesn't hurt. The punchy little flourishes
that load this English gangster film with attitude are perfectly
welcome, because there's no honest, substantial part of the movie
they can hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie is skillful enough to make a fine feat of macho
gamesmanship out of the way four sets of East End crooks keep
outsmarting one another. And if that means having them all arm for
battle while the ``Zorba the Greek'' theme music heightens the
intensity of the moment, well, why not?
</P>
<P>
   Touches like that, along with flashy, random shifts of film
speed and a true rogues' gallery of striking if one-note
characters, do hold interest even if they have no real right to.
The commercial aspects also deflect attention from the fact that
this story has almost no center at all.
</P>
<P>
   The closest it comes to heroes are the four savvy young con men
whom the film introduces first. Ritchie brings on Eddie (Nick
Moran), Tom (Jason Flemying), Bacon (Jason Statham) and Soap
(Dexter Fletcher) as if they were the ``Trainspotting'' crew, but
the story soon begins to lose them in the shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Thick accents, desaturated brownish color and 20-odd actors with
comparably important roles don't do much to alleviate this mild
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Eddie qualifies as the main character because Sting
plays his father, a bar owner named J.D., and because it's Eddie's
gaffe that gets the ball rolling. Eddie is a card shark, and
because his pals are tired of selling stolen merchandise on London
sidewalks and other dubious pursuits, they help him enter a secret
high-stakes game run by Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarity), a shrewd
old pornography merchant and crime boss.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue sets the humorously hard-boiled tone, as when these
two first meet, and Eddie is introduced as J.D.'s son.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must be Harry,'' Eddie coolly remarks. ``Sorry, didn't
know your father.''
</P>
<P>
   And Harry answers: ``Never mind, son. You just might meet him if
you carry on like that.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot more manly posturing along those lines as the
story gets rolling. (The only women in the film are a card dealer,
a topless dancer and a person too easily mistaken for a pile of
throw pillows.) And things get downright dangerous after Eddie
finds himself heavily in debt to Harry and his henchman, Barry the
Baptist (Lenny McLean), who earned his nickname by drowning people.
</P>
<P>
   Harry and Barry are the film's closest approximation of senior
statesmen, and they also embody Ritchie's way of recruiting born
bruisers to add color to his story. The cast also includes a few
real ex-cons and the glowering English soccer star Vinnie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The film is dedicated to McLean, the Cockney world heavyweight
bare knuckle champion, who was just embarking on an acting career
when he died last year.
</P>
<P>
   While Eddie et al. scramble to raise the money they owe Harry,
Harry hires his own team of bumbling thieves to procure the two
antique rifles that figure in the title.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile some stoned aristocratic slackers are raising a
healthy marijuana crop, and a separate gang of drug dealers is
operating right next door to the apartment of Eddie and friends
where it's easy to hear through walls. Enough? Not until the film
throws in a Samoan bar and yet another gang, with a leader whose
quaint Cockneyisms (``Chevy Chase'' for ``face'') add further to
the melee atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   With a big debt to ``The Usual Suspects'' and a ``Reservoir
Dogs,'' like the approach to population control, Ritchie revels in
the sheer knottiness of all this scheming. He makes it lively while
it lasts and empty when it's over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' is rated R (Under 17
requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes one
extremely deadly shootout and other incidences of violence that are
more jokey. Sort of. One scene finds a drug dealer using an
upside-down underling as a target while he hits golf balls.
</P>

`SIX WAYS TO SUNDAY': A HIT MAN MARRIED TO THE MOB, BUT NESTING
WITH MOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If black comedies came any blacker than ``Six Ways to Sunday,''
you'd need the candlepower of a government-surplus lighthouse to
see them.
</P>
<P>
   This rather grand little Guignol, built around incest, makes the
mother-son relationship in `Oedipus Rex'' look like just another
bad heir day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Ways to Sunday,'' set in the seedy precincts of
Youngstown, Ohio, is not for sensitive souls. It drips with bloody
murders, brutal beatings, schizoid behavior, police corruption,
suicide and unhealthy relationships, but it is filled with
character, well acted and directed with skill by Adam Bernstein,
who produced it and wrote the screenplay with Marc Gerald.
</P>
<P>
   And what's even better, for onlookers who survive till journey's
end, is a happy ending that in its own warped way speaks to the
myriad possibilities of love.
</P>
<P>
   Derived from the 1962 Charles Perry novel, ``Portrait of a Young
Man Drowning,'' about Jewish gangsters in Brooklyn, the film
centers on Harry Odum (Norman Reedus), a high school graduate who
flips burgers for a living and shares a shabby home with his
domineering mother, Kate (Deborah Harry, of Blondie), who still
bathes him, controls the light in his room, arranges his guilt
trips and is eager to warn him about young women. ``Girls today are
no good,'' she says. ``They're sluts.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that Kate is fond of negligees and sex lectures that are
as suggestive as they are cautionary, it is little wonder that the
repressed, conflicted Harry goes wild when he accompanies his pal
Arnie (Adrien Brody), a petty hoodlum, to a topless club to
administer a beating to the manager, who is in arrears on payment
to loan sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's zestful attack is so effective that it brings him the
blessing of Arnie's supervisor, Abie (the Bug) Pinkwise (Peter
Appel), and eventually into the employ of the local Big, Louis
Varga (Jerry Adler).
</P>
<P>
   With the wealthy Varga as his benevolent employer and Abie as
his kindly mentor, Harry is soon a certified hit man, bringing in
money, buying a better home for dear old Mom and falling in love in
his sickly way with cute little Iris (Elina Lowensohn), Vargas'
lame servant.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the frayed fringes of Harry's life are Bill Bennett
(Isaac Hayes), a crooked police detective with a mean streak who
knows what drives Harry mad; Annibelle (Anna Thompson), the hooker
Harry pays to not have sex with him, and Madden (Holter Graham),
Harry's suave, handsome and assured alter ego.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, Harry is going to have to make some choices
about Mom and Iris and Abie and Vargas.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   TAX-PREPARERS-HNS (Albany, N.Y. ) _ Daunted by deductions and
confused about credits, taxpayers are expected to seek help for
filing their income tax returns in higher numbers this year. By
Jo-Ann Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   TAX-POLICY-NYT (Washington) _ While the political fight this
year and probably into the 2000 elections will center on _ tax cuts
versus saving Social Security _ there is also a growing focus on
another, older and more fundamental issue. Should tax policy focus
simply on raising the revenue needed to pay for the activities of
government? Or can the tax code be used as an effective instrument
to address the nation's social and economic ills? By Richard W.
Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   TAX-KIDS-EDUC-NYT (Undated) _ The 1998 tax year offers new
possibilities for families who are saving for their children's
college education. By David J. Dent.
</P>
<P>
   TAX-SPOUSE-NYT (Undated) _ Until recently, proving that an
individual was truly innocent _ that he or she had no knowledge of
the violations of the tax laws and did not benefit from the money
kept from the government _ was virtually impossible. A new law that
took effect in July, however, makes innocent-spouse status easier
to claim. By Michelle Leder.
</P>
<P>
   TAX-FILING-NYT (Undated) _ So eager is the IRS to have us file
by computer that its World Wide Web site (www.irs.ustreas.gov)
provides links to private companies offering electronic filing
services. Only about a quarter of all tax returns will be
electronically filed this year. By Neil Genzlinger.
</P>
<P>
   TAX-YUPPIE-NYT (Undated) _ Lowering the tax bill for young urban
professionals. By Abby Ellin.
</P>
<P>
   TAX-GAIN-NYT (Undated) _ Keeping records of stock purchases and
sales and completing the tax forms to report capital gains and
losses is tricky enough for the average investor. But for day
traders, who spend their days flipping stocks, and for a growing
army of other investors who trade often, lured by the bull market
and the ease of trading on line, compliance with tax reporting
rules creates a mountain of paperwork each year. By Carole Gould.
</P>
<P>
   TAX-RETIRE-NYT (Undated) _ Tax laws affecting retirees are
already complicated, and with new provisions in effect for 1998
returns, the situation is even more complex. By Daniel F. Cuff.
</P>
<P>
   TAX-SELF-EMPLOYED-NYT (Undated) _ A growing number of
self-employed entrepreneurs and consultants have move their offices
to their homes to help in tax deductions. By Carole Gould.

<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-HYUNDAI-NYT (Detroit) _ The Sonata sedan, redesigned
for the 1999 model year, embodies just how far the South Korean
auto company Hyundai has come. The Sonata has broken ranks with its
Asian counterparts by establishing a styling statement of its own.
Hyundai's California Design Center, which styled the Sonata, has
long turned out innovative and eye-catching concept cars. Some of
that style is now finally showing up in production vehicles. By
Michelle Krebs.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-SMART-FERRARI-NYT (Undated) _ Tired of your old workaday
Porsche Carrera or Acura NSX? Looking for something a little
sleeker with a little more oomph _ something sure to impress even
the most jaded valet parking attendant? Look no further than the
Ferrari 360 Modena, to be introduced on March 9 at the Geneva Motor
Show. The new model, which will go on sale in North America this
fall, replaces the F355 _ the last-generation ``entry level''
Ferrari. By Peter Passell.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-REVIEW-AZR (Phoenix) - Here comes another holdout, finally
admitting there is only one way to build a proper minivan. They've
all lined up _ Ford, GM, Nissan, eventually Toyota. And now, Honda.
All have come to the same conclusion that the front-wheel-drive,
sliding-door, triple-row-of-seats, tall, squared-off-backside
minivan invented 16 years ago by Chrysler was then and remains
today the best setup for a practical minivan. The Honda Odyssey for
'99 is smooth, roomy, powerful and sophisticated, and pretty much
shoulders its way to the head of the pack. By Bob Golfen.

Angeles. And at 35,000 feet above normal seafood level, too. By

 &HT;    You'll look princess pretty in a drop-dead dress or sassy
separates
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On your mark. Get set. Shop!
</P>
<P>
   Although the big dance is still weeks away, promgoers are
already on the hunt for the perfect outfit. And for the young lady
who wants to make a dazzling impression, a potpourri of styles are
available _ everything from seasonal strapless ball gowns to the
new evening separates. Full and billowy dresses are also popular
this year, as well as narrow and slim designs. For accessories,
butterflies have hit the big time and tiaras will crown many a
coif.
</P>
<P>
   To help with your shopping, we've highlighted some of the
hottest dresses for this year's prom season. Discover your style,
then go and have fun finding that dream dress.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pretty and romantic: To show off your softer side, go for
ballerina-look dresses in tulle, organza or taffeta. Trims feature
embroidered flowers and butterflies, lace and a smattering of
sequins. Look for sun-washed pastels, including yellow, pink,
lavender. White is another top contender for these Cinderella-like
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sporty and sassy: You've seen the look on MTV and on the New
York runways: a sweater set paired with a long skirt for a casual
evening ensemble. A full tulle skirt is a must, in shades of
lavender, powder blue or baby pink. Pair these skirts with shiny
camisoles and cardigans. The great thing about these separates?
After the prom, you can always wear the sweaters with jeans or
khakis.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Go glam: If you prefer to shine with a subtle hint of
elegance, try gowns that are sleek and sophisticated, strapless,
halter-necked or with one shoulder styling. Other styles boast side
cutouts, trains and carved-out backs. Favorite colors are
turquoise, blue, black and silver.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Classic and chic: Snag the spotlight on that special night in
a long, shiny satin dress. Go for a strapless A-line accessorized
with a stole or a ball gown with a bustle. Think classics in black
or white. Or, for more color, go for periwinkle blue or pale pink.

 &HT;    Love outdoors? You can't beat Ga. state parks as natural resort
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Think of Georgia's 45 state parks as uncommonly fine
resorts for the common man. Five have lodges and most have cottages
or camping (and frequently both). Six parks have golf courses, 10
feature tennis courts and most have swimming pools, beaches or
lakes.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, the state parks offer special programs
including nature crafts, snake shows, campfire sing-alongs, guided
hikes and birding. Canoes and motorized fishing boats are available
for rental at many sites year-round.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so none of the parks will be mistaken for the Cloister, but
where else can you experience such natural beauty and agreeable
accommodations for less than $100 a night?
</P>
<P>
   Lodging and restaurants are available at:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Amicalola Falls, Dawsonville ($79-$199; 706-265-8888).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  George T. Bagby, Fort Gaines ($42-$75; 912-768-2571).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Little Ocmulgee, McRae ($50-$75; 912-868-7474).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Red Top Mountain, Cartersville ($69-$109; 770-975-0055).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Unicoi, Helen ($69-$119; 706-878-2201).
</P>
<P>
   The lodges vary from 30 guest rooms at Little Ocmulgee to 100 at
Unicoi, and offer special features such as sleeping lofts and
suites with separate bedrooms and porches. Handicapped-accessible
and nonsmoking rooms are available. Pets not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Vogel State Park in Blairsville has the largest cottage
community with 36 units. Others have from two to 30. Cottages _
from $40 to $165 per night _ are one-, two- or three-bedroom and
all are fully equipped with stoves and refrigerators, cooking and
serving utensils, towels, bed linens and blankets. All have heat
and most have air conditioning. Many cottages have porches or decks
and wood-burning fireplaces or stoves (firewood is not provided).
Accessible cottages are available at many parks. Pets not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Camping ranges from primitive back-country sites for about $3 to
full RV hookups from $10 to $18 a night.
</P>
<P>
   The state's first walk-in lodging is the Len Foote Hike Inn at
Amicalola Falls State Park. You must hike five miles to reach this
rustic lodge with 20 bunk-bed rooms. Rates are $55 per person,
double; $75 single. Breakfast and dinner are included.
</P>
<P>
   Golf courses can be found at Georgia Veterans Park, Cordele;
Gordonia-Altamaha, Reidsville; George T. Bagby, Fort Gaines; Hard
Labor Creek, Rutledge; Little Ocmulgee, McRae; Laura Walker,
Waycross; and Victoria Bryant Park, Royston. Fees vary, but you
can't beat unlimited play from $13 to $18 on weekdays. Rates are
somewhat higher on weekends and there are additional charges for
carts. Bagby's new, 18-hole course was recently named the nation's
sixth-best public golf course by Golf Digest.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight reservations must be made at least two days before
arrival but no more than 11 months in advance. During summer,
minimum stays may be required. To make reservations at any state
park or request a free brochure, call 770-389-7275 (in metro
Atlanta) or 1-800-864-7275.
</P>
<P>
   A $2 park pass is required for all vehicles. A $25 annual pass
can be purchased by calling 404-657-9851. The Georgia Parks Travel
Guide, which lists the parks and their facilities, is $6.95; call
404-656-6538. The information is also on the Web at
http://www.gastateparks.org.

 &HT;    Eight great Southeastern destinations for families
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March, 7.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  Fontana Village, N.C.: A visit to the historic Fontana Village
Resort is like taking the whole family to summer camp. The rustic
and charming resort has three swimming pools (one indoors), a
riding stable, marina, crafts workshop, activities center with
equipment for archery, badminton, tennis, volleyball, shuffleboard
and horseshoes. Stay at the 94-room Fontana Inn or one of the 200
cottages. Built in the early 1940s by the Tennessee Valley
Authority to house construction workers building Fontana Dam, the
town was turned into a sprawling family resort after World War II.
Lodging rates highest in summer: inn $69 and $79; cottages $129 and
$159 (two bedrooms), $159-$189 (three bedrooms). Peppermill
Cafeteria serves hearty mountain country cuisine. Information:
1-800-849-2258 or http://www.fontanavillage.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hilton Head Island, S.C.: The shoe-shaped island's best
feature may be the 12 miles of beaches, but the beaches aren't the
only draw. Hilton Head has several stables that offer guided tours,
and some have special kids' packages and pony rides. Plus, there
are ample opportunities for golf, tennis and water sports. Families
also enjoy the popular dolphin cruises offered by several tour
operators. A good place to weigh all your options is at the Hilton
Head Island Chamber of Commerce Welcome Center on U.S. 278, on the
way into town. Accommodations run the gamut from motel rooms under
$100 to weeklong stays in beachside condos for $1,000 and up.
Hungry? For kids, we love Crazy Crab in Harbour Town and Crabby
Nick's on U.S. 278. Information: Hilton Head Chamber of Commerce,
1-800-523-3373 or http://www.hiltonheadisland.org.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New Orleans: Don't let the sleaze of Bourbon Street keep you
away from the Crescent City. The Big Easy is a great family
destination with the fabulous Aquarium of the Americas, the Audubon
Zoo, riverboat excursions on the mighty Mississippi and the
terrific Louisiana Children's Museum. Kids love visiting the French
Market, snarfing beignets and hot chocolate at Cafe du Monde,
watching street performers in Jackson Square, riding the St.
Charles streetcar and taking horse-drawn carriage rides through the
French Quarter. Expect to pay at least $100 (and potentially far
more) for a room. Le Richelieu, Hotel Provincial and Holiday Inn
Downtown-Superdome are reliable, moderately priced choices. Your
dining options are endless. For a taste of the food that made New
Orleans famous, splurge on Sunday jazz brunch at Court of Two
Sisters, and try the moderately priced Gumbo Shop on St. Peter
Street, just off Jackson Square, or Ralph and Kacoo's on Toulouse.
Information: 504-566-5011, New Orleans Metropolitan Convention and
Visitors Bureau; http://www.neworleanscvb.com or

   &QR;  Huntsville, Ala. Promise the kids the moon and take 'em to the
U.S. Space &AMP; Rocket Center in the Alabama city that produced the
rocket boosters that put men on the moon. Here you can see IMAX
shows about space, take a guided bus tour of NASA's Marshall Space
Flight Center and get a close look at the real Apollo 15 module
that hauled men to the moon. The rocket center spans the distance
between sci-fi space fantasy and sophisticated NASA reality, with
more than 60 interactive exhibits and 1,500 pieces of space
hardware. Downtown Huntsville has a variety of moderately priced
hotels close to the center, including the Radisson Suite Hotel,
several Holiday Inns, Hilton, Marriott and Ramada. Many offer
suites and family specials, with separate bedrooms for children and
parents, for $80 to $120 per night. The center's Galaxy Food Court
serves moderately priced hamburgers, grilled chicken sandwiches and
other American foods. Space Center information: 256-837-3400.

   &QR;  Williamsburg, Va. American history steps out of the textbook
and onto the streets of Colonial Williamsburg, which looks very
much as it did when Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, George
Washington and other patriots formed a new nation. In the restored
capital of Colonial Virginia, families become a part of a bustling
18th-century city filled with ``people of the past'' dressed in
period garb. Although family programs are offered during the summer
only, there's plenty to engage children throughout the year. A
visit is not complete without serving time in the public stocks. Be
sure to have at least one meal in a colonial tavern. Young ladies
play old-fashioned games, get lessons in manners and learn how to
serve tea during ``Felicity's Williamsburg _ An American Girls
Experience,'' a special package that includes accommodations, a
tavern dinner, the Felicity tour and tea, and Patriot's Passes
(1-800-501-0057). Information: 1-800-447-8679 or

   &QR;  Chattanooga. Family Fun magazine ranks Chattanooga among its
10 Family Friendly Cities _ and we know why. The most obvious
reason is the Tennessee Aquarium and 3-D IMAX Theater, the hub of
the city's thriving riverfront. But that's not all: Just up the
street is the Children's Creative Discovery Museum. And smack in
the middle of the action is a great place to stay, the all-suite
Residence Inn by Marriott. Nearby are lots of fun restaurants like
T.G.I. Fridays, Electric Submarine Rock &AMP; Roll Cafe and Cheeburger,
Cheeburger. This summer, a huge, old-fashioned carousel will open
across the Tennessee River in Coolidge Park behind Frazier Avenue
(where you'll find a super toy store called The Big Much). The
Southern Belle Riverboat offers river excursions. Round out your
stay with visits to the Chattanooga Choo Choo (you can even spend
the night in a restored Pullman car) and close-by attractions
including Rock City, Ruby Falls and the Incline Railway. Another
bonus: free shuttles run daily from the Choo Choo to the aquarium.

   &QR;  Jekyll Island (Ga.). Once upon a time, Jekyll Island was the
playground of the rich and famous. Now, you don't have to be either
to vacation on the historic island. Even in summer (high season),
it is possible for a family to find a place to stay on the beach
for less than $100 a night. And most restaurants are reasonably
priced and cater to families. In addition to 10 miles of beach,
you'll find Summer Waves Waterpark (open daily Memorial Day through
Labor Day), 63 holes of golf, tennis courts, miniature golf,
bicycle rentals (to explore 20 miles of paved trails), horseback
riding, fishing and sightseeing. Be sure to take a tour of the
island's National Historic Landmark District to learn about the
days when it was a ``millionaires' village.'' Tours leave 10 a.m.-3
p.m. daily from the Museum Visitors Center on Stable Road, where
free exhibits describe Jekyll's history. Information:

   &QR;  St. Augustine, Fla. If your kids think you're old, take them
to a place that'sreally ancient _ America's oldest, continuously
occupied European settlement, founded in 1565. Visit the Oldest
House, the Oldest Wooden Schoolhouse, the late 17th century Fort
Castillo de San Marcos and Ponce de Leon's Fountain of Youth. The
kids will also get a kick out of 3D World; Potter's Wax Museum,
where figures appear quite lifelike; and Ripley's Believe It or
Not! Museum, a collection of the world's oddities housed in
historic Castle Warden. Cruises on Matanzas Bay and horse-drawn
carriage rides are lots of fun, too. Older children will enjoy ``A
Ghostly Experience'' walking tours. Outside the historic district,
don't miss Alligator Farm, the Lighthouse and Museum and the
beaches of Anastasia Island. Plenty of good accommodations from
motels to historic inns (although some do not allow children).
Information: 1-800-653-2489 (ask for a free St. Johns County Travel
Planner) or http://www.oldcity.com.

 &HT;    Discover 10 great inns of the Southeast
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   So many inns, so little time. The region is dotted with
wonderful places to spend the night. This is just a sampling of
some of our favorites from recent travels. Some are country-cozy,
others are elegant. All are special in their own way.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Balsam Mountain Inn, Balsam, N.C. The best feature of this
comfortable 50-room inn, opened in 1908, may be the two-level
veranda from which one can rock, relax and gaze at surrounding
mountains. The inn's current incarnation dates to 1990, when
innkeeper Merrily Teasley began restoration of the neoclassical
Victorian structure perched on a hill above the Balsam Depot.
Inside are restored hardwood floors, beaded board walls, antique
wicker and Victorian trim. A double-sided fireplace in the spacious
lobby keeps the place cozy in winter. Rooms feature bent wood or
painted iron beds piled with down comforters (but no TVs or
phones), and some baths have antique claw-foot tubs. A full
breakfast is included; lunch and dinner are available. Information:
$90-$150. 1-800-224-9498 or
http://www1.aksi.net/(tilde)cmark/balsam.htm.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cedar Crest Inn, Asheville, N.C. Built in 1891 by the same
craftsmen who worked on the Biltmore Estate, the inn has beveled
glass and hand-carved oak mantels and trim similar to what is in
the nearby Vanderbilt mansion. The grand, yellow-painted Queen Anne
Victorian home _ listed on the National Register of Historic Places
_ sits high above Biltmore Avenue. The antiques-filled guest rooms
(each with its own character) and common areas are elegant but not
stuffy. Breakfast is served in the formal dining room, where, in
the evening, guests find cookies and hot or cold drinks (depending
on the season). Barbara and Jack McEwan are the hospitable hosts.
In addition to the 10 rooms in the main house, there is a guest
cottage and a bungalow. Downtown Asheville, with its shops and
galleries, is 1 1/2 miles north on Biltmore Avenue; the entrance to
Biltmore House is a quarter mile south. Information: $135-$200.

<P>
   &QR;  Richmont Inn, Townsend, Tenn. The Richmont's design echoes the
cantilevered barns of East Tennessee in which the second story
overhangs the first. But the rustic barn motif stays outside at the
casually elegant bed-and-breakfast with 10 guest rooms on three
floors, many featuring intimate balconies looking out at Rich
Mountain. Owners Jim and Susan Hind chose the barn design as a
tribute to their Tennessee roots. The historic theme continues in
the rooms, each decorated to honor an eminent mountain figure. The
Francis Asbury Room, for instance, is a tribute to a church circuit
rider who tirelessly spread the gospel in the Smoky Mountains in
the late 1700s and early 1800s. Motifs in other rooms include folk
art, botanical, log cabin and country parlor. In addition to the
gourmet breakfast, served in a dining area with floor-to-ceiling
windows with a mountain view, a stay at the inn includes
candlelight dessert for two every evening. Many of the guest rooms
have wood-burning fireplaces or spa tubs for two. Lounging robes
are provided, and romantic music is piped into the rooms until late
each night. Information: $95-$145. 423-448-6751 or

<P>
   &QR;  Kendall Manor Inn, Eufaula, Ala. This elegant
bed-and-breakfast _ meticulously restored by Barbara Lubsen and her
husband, Tim _ is one of the crown jewels in a town that boasts
more than 700 architecturally significant structures dating to
1836. The National Register home two blocks from downtown is a
favorite stop on the annual Eufaula Pilgrimage (coming up April
9-11). Staying at Kendall Manor Inn is like stepping back a century
_ but with queen and king beds, telephones with dataports, heat and
air conditioning, indoor plumbing and a television (if you want one
brought to your room). Built by cotton magnate James Turner
Kendall, the home was completed in 1872. Architectural highlights
include the ruby-red Czechoslovakian glass sidelights for the
massive front door, Italian marble mantels and French gold-leaf
cornices and mirror frame in the front parlor. A carved walnut
staircase leads to the second floor. Topping it all is an
arch-windowed belvedere that provides vistas for miles.
Information: $89-$109. 334-687-8847.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mentone Inn, Mentone, Ala. ``Make yourself at home'' seems to
be the theme at this unpretentious inn on the Lookout Mountain
Parkway at the crossroads of the quaint little community of
Mentone. Frankly, it feels a little like visiting your grandmother
(that is, if she lived in a rustic house in the country). Rooms are
smallish but nicely decorated in country style, and some of the
baths have clawfoot tubs. There's a TV and stone fireplace in the
living room, where folks gather before turning in for the night.
The mountain-man breakfasts of eggs, grits, sausage, biscuit, OJ
and fresh fruit fortify guests for checking Mentone's craft and
antiques shops as well as nearby DeSoto Falls, DeSoto State Park,
Little River Canyon and Sequoyah Caverns. Information: Reopening
for the season in May. $70-$125. 256-634-4836.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Casablanca Inn, St. Augustine, Fla. This 1914 Mediterranean
revival home in the oldest city's historic district offers
panoramic views of Mantanzas Bay and traffic _ some of the
horse-and-carriage variety _ along Avenue Menendez. Guests take
breakfast on the porches that catch the breeze from the bay. Rooms
are decorated with antiques and some have Jacuzzis. All have
red-ribboned Casablanca bears sitting on the beds, ready for
snuggling. There are no TVs or phones in guest rooms in the main
house, but they are provided in the Coach House. Bicycles are
available at no cost to all guests. Legend has it that the house is
haunted by the spirit of a woman who signaled with a lantern to
warn rumrunners that the revenue boys were in town _ but that just
adds to the allure of the home that's listed on the National
Register of Historic Places. Special touches include a never-empty
plate of homemade cookies and a help-yourself fridge stocked with
soft drinks and beer. The inn is within walking distance of St.
Augustine's historic attractions and restaurants. Information:
$89-$199. 1-800-826-2626 or http://www.casablanca.com
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gastonian, Savannah (Ga.). One of the grandest of Savannah's
grand dames is this 1868 charmer on a quiet residential street in
the nation's largest Historic Landmark District. Actually, the
17-room inn on East Gaston Street, two blocks from Forsyth Park, is
two Regency Italianate mansions connected by a green and tranquil
courtyard _ and there's an elevated deck with hot tub and a
carriage house in the rear. Sumptuously decorated and filled with
fine English antiques and a Waterford chandelier in the dining
room, the home is a showplace of elegance and good taste. Speaking
of good taste, breakfasts are gourmet Southern repasts, afternoon
tea is served with complimentary wines, and cordials await in the
parlor at night. Innkeeper Anne Landers, a former Atlantan who
bought the inn in October 1996, continues the tradition of
attention to details established in 1985 by Hugh and Roberta
Lineberger, who restored the two buildings. Rooms, all with working
fire-
</P>
<P>
   places, are appointed with Oriental carpets and antiques (some
are upper crust English in character, while others are pure
Americana), and most feature huge Jacuzzi tubs. Turndown service
includes sweets such as pecan pralines and floor mats beside the
bed. Information: $295-$350. 1-800-322-6603 or
http://www.gastonianinn.com
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1884 Paxton House Inn,
</P>
<P>
   Thomasville. This blue and white Gothic Victorian beauty, with
its wraparound veranda and gazebo, is one of only two such homes in
the southwest Georgia town where presidents, royalty and the
wealthy have come to relax and socialize for more than a century.
Located in the Tockwotton Historic District, the inn has been
lovingly restored by Susie Sherrod and has received local and state
awards for preservation. The home features heart pine floors, a
circular staircase and a dozen fireplaces. Rooms are decorated with
antiques and Sherrod's remarkable collections of Messein porcelain,
dolls, Lladro figurines and clocks and handpainted Russian boxes _
amassed as she traveled abroad as an Army nurse. A full breakfast
is served in a light-filled sunroom with views of the backyard
gardens. In addition to four suites in the main house, there are
four rooms in the Garden Cottage and a suite in the poolhouse
(which has an indoor lap pool for use of all guests). All have
cable TV, phones, terrycloth robes, hair dryers and goosedown
pillows. The inn is an easy stroll from the restored historic
downtown, museums, restaurants and historic sites.

   &QR;  Bluff View Inn, Chattanooga. Three historic houses make up the
Bluff View Inn: the late 19th-century Maclellan House, a restored
Tudor mansion on a bluff overlooking the Tennessee River; the 1927
Colonial-style C.G. Martin House; and the 1908 Victorian-style T.C.
Thompson House. They are all part of the Bluff View Arts District,
tucked away on a cul-de-sac, adjacent to the Hunter Museum and the
Houston Museum of Decorative Arts. The lodgings share the block
with the River Gallery, an outdoor sculpture garden, Rembrandt's
Coffee House, Tony's Pasta Shop &AMP; Trattoria and the Back Inn Cafe.
Our cozy third-floor room at the Maclellan was elegantly decorated
in soothing tones of mauve and green and furnished with a
queen-size sleigh bed, an antique secretary and sofa. Guests of all
three inns are served a three-course gourmet breakfast in the
Audubon Room at the Maclellan or continental fare at Rembrandt's.
Information: $100-$250. 423-265-5033.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Inn at Merridun, Union, S.C. Listed on the National Register
of Historic Places, this antebellum country inn with stately
Corinthian columns is tucked away on nine woodsy acres off a busy
highway. Innkeepers Peggy and Jim Waller are gourmet cooks whose
talents are apparent at the bounteous breakfasts, highlighted by
blueberry pancakes for ``dessert,'' and elegant candlelight dinners
at additional cost for overnight guests by reservation only. J.D.,
the yellow and white inn cat, is the purrsonable host with the
most. Each of the five distinctively decorated bedrooms has a
private bath, including Lucy's Garden Retreat with a jacuzzi tub.
Information: $79-$99. 864-427-7052.

`RELAX ... IT'S ONLY SEX': THE NAMES ARE QUIRKY, AND THE SEX IS
MORE SO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(rk) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not so long ago, in movieland, couples met cute. In ``Relax ...
It's Only Sex,'' they have sex cute. Two fashionable West Hollywood
gay men make love while discussing a future menu (something about
salmon and fresh parsley). Another gay man carries on an internal
(voice-over) monologue through much of the act about the
advisability of taking a particular health risk.
</P>
<P>
   The film's token straight couple ravage each other in the
kitchen so recklessly that nearby pots and pans rattle and clatter
to the floor. This is shortly after the woman, Tara (Jennifer
Tilly), tries to prove just how adorably frank she is by hitting
the man, Gus (Timothy Paul Perez), on the back and whining, ``But I
want your sperm!''
</P>
<P>
   Tara sets the tone for ``Relax ... It's Only Sex,'' an energetic
and often good-looking but completely unseductive film from P.J.
Castellaneta. In this comic drama about a group of California
friends, Tara gets the lines that are meant to be endearingly naive
(``AIDS is the biggest tragedy of the 20th century. Even Madonna
thinks so.'') or casually clever (``You know how lesbians are.
They're like Catholics or `Saturday Night Live.' They go on
forever, no matter how bad it gets'').
</P>
<P>
   Castellaneta, whose first film was ``Together Alone,'' a
two-character drama set on the morning after what may have been a
one-night stand, seems to be trying a little too hard to impress
here.
</P>
<P>
   Some characters and situations come off as too deliberately
quirky. Serena Scott Thomas, for instance, plays Megan, a very
femme British lesbian who has suddenly decided she's straight. Her
parents (Seymour Cassel and Susan Tyrell) are furious, because
they've become very active in an organization for the parents of
gay men and lesbians; Cassel's character even has a book coming out
on the subject. What are people going to say when they learn Megan
is dating men?
</P>
<P>
   One actor does stand out. When T.C. Carson appears, he
effortlessly takes over the screen. His character, a painter who
contends that HIV has nothing to do with AIDS, could have come off
as falsely quirky too, but Carson (who was the star of the film
``Livin' Large'') makes him absolutely believable and fascinating
to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax ... It's Only Sex'' has no shortage of events. The plot
includes an HIV diagnosis, a gay bashing, a
homosexual-to-heterosexual male rape, one character's affair with
her lover's cousin, a problem pregnancy and oh so much more. Even
the characters' names are a little complicated. I watched the
entire film thinking that one member of this circle of friends was
Harvey, but he turned out to be Javi (Eddie Garcia), and I was sure
that Megan was dating Jerry, but he turned out to be Jered (Billy
Wirth). The characters in ``Together Alone'' were named Brian and
Bryan, so maybe Castellaneta just enjoys nomenclature games.

BATTLEFIELD OF BONES: DOMINO TOURNAMENT BRINGS ACCLAIM TO TEXAS
TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLETTSVILLE, Texas _ They're going to shake the bones in South
Texas this weekend. They'll be stirring and drawing, bidding and
slamming. There will be 200 people competing, and the Knights of
Columbus Hall will be the battleground.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Texas State Championship 42 Domino Tournament and it
is serious business. The rules are rigid: no talking, no touching,
no signals. No nelo, and if you bid in ``follow me,'' doubles are
not a suit of their own.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know the meaning of all this, stay out of the line
of fire and just enjoy the kolaches, the sausages and the
hospitality of this German/Czech community.
</P>
<P>
   Hallettsville is as old as the state. John Hallet settled here
in 1833, built a log cabin on a league of land in the Austin
Colony, and then went to Goliad and died. His wife returned to the
cabin and a town sprang up around it.
</P>
<P>
   This area of South Texas, midway between San Antonio and
Houston, was populated in the late 19th century with immigrants
from Czechoslovakia and Germany. The heritage is evident from the
Kahanek &AMP; Renger Drug Store to Novosad's Meat Market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This community is very unique,'' said Frank Fishar, president
of the chamber of commerce. ``We have a lot of different events
throughout the year. The domino tournaments are big events. We also
have a four-day fiddlers festival, a polka and sausage festival and
two big church picnics.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a kolache festival, too. Last year, 800 dozen of the
pastries were consumed.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the domino tournaments that bring the most acclaim to
the town of 2,700. There is a straight domino championship in
January, and the 42 tournament in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call Hallettsville the domino capital of Texas,'' said
Bob Pesek, chairman of the straight tournament. ``This is a
community of German and Czech settlers, and dominoes have always
been a part of their pastime.''
</P>
<P>
   Straight dominoes is probably the more popular of the two games,
although it seems that most everyone in Hallettsville plays both.
</P>
<P>
   The straight tournament has had more than 390 players at one
time. The 42 competition topped out last year with 202 players.
Still, there is evidence that 42 is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, we had 30 teams, last year, 101. It is growing
both because more people know about it and because 42 is gaining in
popularity,'' said Jim Foster, chairman of the 42 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The competition draws a lot of Texas A&AMP;M University students, he
said. ``They are learning the game at the Dixie Chicken in College
Station.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's Dennis Roberson can attest to 42's popularity. Last
year, Texas Tech University Press published his book ``Winning 42 _
Strategy and Lore of the National Game of Texas,'' and it is
already scheduled for a third printing.
</P>
<P>
   The game is taken from cards and is similar to hearts or spades,
a little like bridge. Players must bid on their hand, take tricks
and count points _ 42 in all.
</P>
<P>
   Roberson is a veteran of the Hallettsville tournament. He won't
attend this year because his wife, Charlene, delivered the couple's
daughter, Katy, on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad is going to go without me this year,'' Roberson said.
``But the people down there are going to let me know who wins the
tournament, so I can get their name in the next printing of my
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberson also intends to include a new chapter that will discuss
Texas celebrities and their experiences with 42. He sent out
questionnaires and has had responses from singers Robert Earl Keen
and B.J. Thomas, writer Bud Shrake
</P>
<P>
   and TV journalist Bill Moyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale Evans' parents played 42,'' Roberson said. ``I also heard
back from (Texas first lady) Laura Bush. She said she and her
grandmother played all the time while she was growing up in
Midland, and that Laura and George W. played quite a bit until the
twins were born.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hallettsville, there isn't a tavern without a domino table.
The old slate tables, where marks are kept in chalk on the black
surface, are gone, replaced by Formica.
</P>
<P>
   There are domino clubs in the community. ``We have 22 people in
ours,'' Foster said. ``Twenty who play and two will cook. It's been
going on for 28 years, and I can promise you the food will be good
and so will the fellowship.''
</P>
<P>
   Every town around here has domino clubs. There are satellite
tournaments in places such as Wharton, Yoakum, Shiner, Ganado and
Victoria. To come to Hallettsville and win represents the ultimate
in bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much money involved. The winner in Saturday's
tournament only gets $75 and a trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to remember it is still just a game,'' said Foster.
``We want to keep it fun and in the spirit of friendly
competition.''

`ROCK THE BOAT': AN HIV-POSITIVE CREW VS. 2,200 PACIFIC MILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We're either stupid or brave; it depends on the moment,''
jokes a crew member of the Survivor, a racing sloop sailed by a
crew of 11 HIV-positive men in the grueling 1997 Trans-Pacific
Yacht Race, known as TransPac.
</P>
<P>
   Watching ``Rock the Boat,'' Bobby Houston's moving documentary
of this tumultuous 2,200-mile race from Southern California to
Hawaii, you can only marvel at the courage and stamina of the
sailors making a voyage that is about the farthest thing imaginable
from a luxury cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Before setting sail, more than one crew member had had little or
no experience on the water. During the 10-day voyage, the Survivor
was threatened by a hurricane, suffered severe damage and nearly
capsized several times. Of the 39 boats that competed, only 32
finished. The Survivor placed a respectable 19th.
</P>
<P>
   The real victory of the Survivor, of course, was in simply going
the distance. Although there were numerous minor injuries and was
plenty of seasickness on a voyage one crew member describes as like
being continuously tossed around on a roller coaster in the dark,
no one died or became seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the film, the crew members introduce
themselves one by one, each naming the year he learned of his
HIV-status. Many have lost one or more lovers to AIDS, not to
mention countless friends, and their stark tales of loss are simply
heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   Before the race, the names of many of those lovers and friends
were inscribed on the ship's hull, both as a memorial and a prayer
summoning the spirits of the dead as guardian ``angels.''
</P>
<P>
   One sailor after another recalls interpreting the news of his
own HIV status as a death sentence that is later commuted by the
arrival of life-prolonging AIDS drug cocktails. Among other things,
the Survivor is shown to be a floating pharmacy of expensive
medications.
</P>
<P>
   Because the TransPac is one of the world's fastest and most
hazardous boating competitions, few members of the crew really knew
what they were in for when they joined. The maneuvering of a small
sailing ship buffeted by 20- to 30-knot winds and huge waves for
much of the journey required rigorous 24-hour-a-day teamwork just
to keep the vessel afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock the Boat,'' which opens in New York on Friday, balances
brief incisive portraits of the 11 sailors with an account of the
voyage and its preparation. Its mastermind, Robert Hudson, is a
hard-driving 36-year-old Los Angeles businessman and sailor who
organized the team and raised much of the money to purchase the
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed with just a single camera on board, the movie forcefully
conveys the sense of living in extremely cramped quarters, racing
across the Pacific while being tossed around like a cork.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are mentions of growing strife among the crew
members as the voyage progressed, the movie doesn't have time to
develop any personal stories. It does suggest that tension between
Hudson and the ship's captain, John Plander, a doctor and
experienced seaman who began to lose patience with the more
inexperienced crew members, nearly reached the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing like making it safely through the thick of
battle to bring a disparate and quarrelsome group together in the
end. ``Rock the Boat'' leaves you cheering for each and every one.

`ANALYZE THIS': MOBSTER WITH PANIC ATTACKS MEETS THERAPIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Analyze This'' (say that second word with feeling!) has a
funny title, an even funnier premise and inspired odd-couple
casting that's enough to prompt laughter just on the basis of the
two-shots in its ad campaign. Think of it as an offer you can't
refuse.
</P>
<P>
   With the utmost affection, Harold Ramis' new comedy summons the
hallmarks of a mob movie and just the man to send them up: Robert
De Niro, in the hilarious role of a don experiencing fits of
self-doubt. Without betraying the genre that has handed him such
choice opportunities, De Niro gives a performance that amounts to
one long wink at the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   And the funniest thing he does here is to play the role of Paul
Vitti (other characters in the movie react to this name exactly as
if it were John Gotti) nearly straight. Vitti doesn't lighten up,
not even when he ought to. ``Would you stop talking? I'm trying to
(italics)do(end italics) this here!'' says Vitti to his girlfriend
when the two of them are in bed.
</P>
<P>
   One day, while yelling ``Who killed Dominick?'' and trying to
beat a confession out of a gangland enemy, Vitti finds himself
unable to strike a decent blow. He himself has been hit by a crisis
of confidence and walloped hard.
</P>
<P>
   And since the inability to inflict harm is a serious liability
in his line of work, Vitti needs help in a hurry. Sure, the first
doctor to tell Vitti that he's had a panic attack gets roughed up;
Vitti doesn't welcome that diagnosis. But the second medical man,
Dr. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal), gets the patient from hell on a
24-hour basis.
</P>
<P>
   These days every good new film idea has a roommate, so the HBO
series ``The Sopranos'' also revolves around the notion of a
mobster in need of psychological help. Happily, the world of pop
culture is big enough for two versions of this premise, especially
when both are such fun.
</P>
<P>
   As he demonstrated in ``Groundhog Day,'' Ramis knows how to
handle a high-concept story with unusual cleverness, and he does it
again here. It helps to no end that De Niro and Crystal, despite
their obvious differences, are perfectly in tune.
</P>
<P>
   As written by Peter Tolan, Ramis and Kenneth Lonergan, ``Analyze
This'' works best when it concentrates on the culture clash between
the two of them. Its subplots (one about mob infighting, one about
the psychiatrist's imminent wedding) are weaker, but why care?
</P>
<P>
   The two stars meet often and crazily enough to keep the movie on
track, especially after Vitti decides that his peace of mind
depends entirely on the doctor. ``The load?'' he exclaims after
their first little talk. ``Gone! Where is it? Don't know! You're
good, Doc. I'm gonna be getting in touch with (italics)you.''(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are gags here based on Vitti's way of demanding
the doctor's company in the wee hours of the night, or causing
trouble whenever the doctor starts to get married. (Lisa Kudrow
does her best with the routine role of his exasperated fiancee.)
</P>
<P>
   And there are frequent opportunities for sight gags, as when
Vitti expresses his gratitude to the doctor with the gift of a
huge, ornate lawn fountain. ``Call the Vatican,'' the doctor says
drily. ``See if anything is missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wicked as the stars and the one-liners can be, ``Analyze This''
does drift away from its strong suit at times. Crystal is much
better as a beleaguered doctor than he is at impersonating a
gangster, which the last and iffiest part of the screenplay makes
him do. De Niro boohoos comically when talking about Vitti's
childhood until the film starts taking an early trauma seriously
and pushing for a therapeutic breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, he happens to be in the midst of a shootout when
his emotional catharsis kicks in. And the scared doctor is at his
side, begging him to ``turn this nice grief into murderous rage!''
</P>
<P>
   Contributing nicely to the mock-mob ambiance are Joe Viterelli
as Jelly, the faithful Vitti sidekick in charge of borrowing the
doctor whenever it's least convenient, and Chazz Palminteri as an
even more dapper Don than the one De Niro plays. (The costumes are
often funny in their own right.)
</P>
<P>
   From its clotheshorse crime bosses to its shootout filmed in
slow motion and accompanied by opera, ``Analyze This'' knows just
where to aim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyze This'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes mild violence, brief sexual
references and profanity used in familiar gangland fashion.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every so often, though not close to often enough,
something sharp and radiant pierces through the sticky, acrid muck
that is being called ``Annie Get Your Gun.'' That something is
starlight, and not surprisingly it emanates from Bernadette Peters,
who has taken on the title role in the misconceived revival that
opened Thursday night at the Marquis Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peters, as you probably know, is one of the few great
performers under 70 who came of age in the American musical
theater, and she still treats a Broadway stage as if it were her
first home. When she starts to sing in that oversize little-girl
voice, it feels like an invitation to walk straight into her heart.
Even the silliest seeming ditties can become affectingly sincere
confessions when delivered by Ms. Peters. She is an enduring and
essential reminder of the emotional vitality of a genre that in
recent years has lost its way.
</P>
<P>
   When such a rare natural resource is squandered, it's hard not
to get angry, and the abuse of Ms. Peters in this tawdry take on
Irving Berlin's most famous musical is definitely cause for fuming.
As staged by Graciela Daniele, from a revision by Peter Stone of
Herbert and Dorothy Fields' original book, this ``Annie Get Your
Gun'' takes the idea of hiding your light under a bushel to new
extremes. Misdirected and miscast in a role forever associated with
its originator, Ethel Merman, Ms. Peters still manages to give off
flickers of her special brand of magic. But almost everything
around her is conspiring to camouflage it.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't one of those shows where you sit there open-mouthed
wondering, ``What on earth were they thinking?'' The intentions of
the production's creators are clear: to transform a period piece,
with a quaint, creaky book and a great score, into something
acceptable to contemporary tastes. Yet in pursuit of this goal, the
show seems to be perpetually apologizing for itself, keeping the
corny, tuneful work at its center at a disdainful distance.
</P>
<P>
   There's an implicit sneer in the exaggerated delivery of the
jokes; in the vulgar, catch-all choreography by Ms. Daniele and
Jeff Calhoun; in the uncharacteristically lurid sets and costumes
by the Tony Walton and William Ivey Long, respectively; even in the
mumbling hillbilly drawl Ms. Peters has affected. Presumably the
idea was to create a colorful, celebratory fantasy of what the
American musical once was. The effect, however, is of a late show
in Las Vegas or Atlantic City, N.J., performed by a worn-out cast
that is more than ready to go home.
</P>
<P>
   In Stone's revision, this story of performing sharpshooters in
competition and in love opens with pre-emptive self-consciousness.
The musical's famous anthem, ``There's No Business Like Show
Business,'' has been moved from the middle of the first act to its
very beginning, where it is sung a cappella in ruminative, dreamy
style by Tom Wopat, the evening's leading man.
</P>
<P>
   A big-top tent is cranked up by Ron Holgate, the actor who plays
Buffalo Bill, whose Wild West show is the pivot of the musical.
What we are about to see, we are told, is a play within a play, and
there is a firm suggestion that we are not to take it too
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   What follows, however, immediately shatters any sense of gentle,
nostalgic reverie. The tale of the rustic Annie's rise to stardom
as a markswoman and her conflicting romantic pursuit of the dapper
Frank Butler (Wopat), her professional rival, is presented with
both hard-pushing shrillness and a weary lack of conviction, and
the show seems both to pander to and patronize the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Stone has spoken in interviews of reshaping the script to
eliminate any cause for political embarrassment, especially in its
portrayal of American Indian characters and what might have been
construed as antifeminist sentiment. Yet what has been substituted
somehow seems even more abrasive. It is impossible, for example,
not to flinch when one white man says admiringly to another, after
being bested by an Indian in a business deal, ``How the hell did we
ever get this country away from them?''
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, the show now features a racist buffoon of a
villain in Dolly Tate (Valerie Wright), Frank's lovelorn assistant,
who works hard to thwart the romance between her younger sister,
Winnie (Nicole Ruth Snelson), and Tommy Keeler (Andrew Palermo),
who is half Indian. (The egalitarian Annie, on the other hand, aids
the embattled lovers while observing, ``Indians are real fine
folks.'')
</P>
<P>
   Dolly's prejudice apparently justifies her being the target of
the show's most mean-spirited jokes, which are built around the
vanity of a sex-starved woman and are themselves a study in
misogyny. To say that the brittle Ms. Wright does not redeem the
role is simply to say that she fails to achieve the impossible. And
the desperation-edged, broad-stroke quality of her performance is
by no means unique to her.
</P>
<P>
   The gravest casualty of this kind of caricature is, of course,
Ms. Peters, who for much of the performance speaks in a turgid,
twangy accent that brings to mind the inbred yokels of Erskine
Caldwell. Her molasses-slow delivery means you can anticipate
Annie's threadbare punch lines long before she reaches them. And
the bruisable, fragile quality that has been such an asset to her
in other roles works against her here.
</P>
<P>
   Merman could triumph as Annie, in both the original 1946
production and the 1966 revival, because her steamroller strength
was irony-proof and prurience-proof. In cast recordings you can
hear the get-on-with-it determination in her voice. She is utterly
winning when she belts the lewd double-entendres in ``Doin' What
Comes Natur'lly'' because there's never a wink in her voice. And
there was clearly never any danger of her turning into the docile
child wife of Frank Butler's fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   In this version, when Frank sings wistfully about ``the girl
that I marry'' as ``a doll I can carry'' and someone as ``soft and
pink as a nursery,'' he is in fact describing Ms. Peters. There is
an emotional delicacy to this Annie, evident even beneath her
soiled buckskins and mush-mouthed speech, that is intermittently
touching but way out of sync with the burlesque tone of the rest of
the show. And the sex jokes, especially the allusions to Annie's
breasts, make you squirm in ways they wouldn't have with the
forthright Merman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is Ms. Peters who provides the show with its only
genuine pleasures, and they come when she sings. The orchestrations
of Ms. Peters' romantic numbers are joltingly different from any of
the other songs, more appropriate to a cabaret act or concert. They
have the virtue, however, of nicely setting off the shimmering
layers of feeling Ms. Peters brings to ballads like ``Moonshine
Lullaby'' and ``I Got Lost in His Arms.'' She seems to pull us all
into a collective embrace with a mere catch in her voice or a hint
of a tear, and there are moments when nothing seems to exist but
the star, the song and the audience.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not for long. Ms. Daniele and Calhoun keep cluttering the stage
with their distracting, eclectic choreography, which ranges from
pure carnival kootch dancing to slow-motion undulations a la Fosse.
Both choreographers borrow tricks from their previous efforts: the
daguerreotype silhouette effects Ms. Daniele used in ``Ragtime''
and even a hoop dance that brings to mind Calhoun's work on
``Grease!,'' another unfortunate revival produced by Barry and Fran
Weissler.
</P>
<P>
   Most often the dancers evoke the ensembles that shape themselves
into flattering frames for aging divas in nightclub acts. This is
especially bizarre when Frank sings ``My Defenses Are Down,'' about
having fallen for Annie, while a chorus line of posturing cowboys
seems to be tempting him to consider other sexual alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Wopat, who is best known for the television series ``The Dukes
of Hazzard,'' is the only cast member to emerge unscarred. He has a
pleasant singing voice and an effortless, low-key presence that is
in marked contrast to the other performers, whose oddly disaffected
eagerness suggests that some martinet is waiting in the wings for
them with a whip. There's little spark between Wopat and Ms.
Peters, but since almost nothing in the show connects to anything
else, this is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the middle of the second act, when Frank and Annie decide
to get married, he speaks complacently about her learning to honor
and obey him. Ms. Peters lowers her chin defiantly at this
suggestion, and for the first time in the evening, her eyes flash.
In the number that follows, the delightful he-says, she-says
counterpoint ``An Old-Fashioned Wedding,'' the actress seems to
shake off the shackles of her hokey accent and the tedious
production to become an unfettered, impish life force, full of both
real feeling and gleeful mischief.
</P>
<P>
   It's a short-lived moment of catharsis, but it lasts just long
enough to remind you of how good a musical can make you feel. Few
people can transmit this sense of pleasure as well as Ms. Peters.
It is painful to see such an expert reduced to shooting blanks.

A FORMER LEVI STRAUSS MANAGER SUES THE FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A former Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. manager claims in a
lawsuit that she was fired for cooperating in an investigation of
two supervisors who promoted women with whom they were allegedly
having affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit filed Wednesday in San Francisco Superior Court, 44-
year-old Patricia Ogden, a 12-year veteran of the company, accuses
it of retaliation, age and sex discrimination, sexual harassment
and breach of contract following her termination in October last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Levi Strauss) has the public image of being a progressive
company. That public perception is not consistent with what I've
seen,'' said Ogden's lawyer, Philip Kay of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kay, Ogden, the former merchandise manager of men's
shirts for Levi's Dockers division, was supervised by two men _
Vincent Tavani, marketing director of the company's Dockers' brand
and James Capon, president of Dockers.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, according to the suit, were sexually involved with
two lower ranking employees. ``Two senior executives were having an
affair with these two women. The two women were getting advances in
the company they weren't entitled to receive,'' Kay said.
</P>
<P>
   Kay contends his client was fired for taking part in an
investigation of the alleged relationships that was prompted by
another employee, a male merchandising manager.
</P>
<P>
   Tavani, reached at his home, said he had not seen the suit or
talked to anyone in the company about it. ``This is all new,'' he
said, refusing further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Capon could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss spokesman Dan Chew said he could not comment
because the company had not yet been served with the lawsuit. ``We
wouldn't comment on any employee issues out of respect of both
privacy of current employees as well as previous ones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says that in August 1997 the company fired the male
merchandising manager after he complained about one of the alleged
relationships. In November 1997, according to the suit, Levi
Strauss initiated an investigation into the man's claims, which was
handled by an outside counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says Ogden objected to the promotions made by Tavani in
December 1997. Specifically, she objected to the promotions of the
woman Tavani was allegedly involved with as well as the woman with
whom Capon was rumored to be having an affair.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, Ogden claims, she received the first written
criticism of her performance from Tavani. When Ogden sought help
from a Levi Strauss attorney, she was told about the investigation
and relayed what she knew on the assurance she would not be subject
to retaliation, the suit states.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Tavani, according to the complaint,
resulted in that supervisor apologizing to his subordinate
managers, including Ogden. In August 1998, Tavani was promoted to
marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden said she was fired in October 1998 after a negative
mid-year review and after she refused to make changes in a product
line suggested by a designer. Ogden claims Tavani was having an
affair with the designer as well. The suit claims two other
employees _ one who cooperated with the initial complaint and
another who agreed with Ogden about the design change _ were fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pure retaliation,'' Kay said. ``The message this has
sent is that anytime anyone cooperates in an investigation based on
someone above them, they will be subject to losing their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay argues his client had a strong reputation in a Levi division
that has been performing well: ``Odgen was a superstar there. There
was no reason to get rid of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Levi Strauss blamed its 13 percent sales drop on
poor sales of its classic five-pocket jeans but described its 1998
Dockers sales as ``record breaking.''

A SOBERING LOOK AT GLOBAL GRAYING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Feeling old lately? You're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   A huge percentage of the Earth's population is heading for
senior status, in numbers never before seen. And as the world
continues to gray, the ranks of younger generations are thinning.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the birth rate, which is dropping drastically. The
fertility rate in developed countries is down to 1.6 children per
woman, 25 percent beneath the rate necessary to maintain current
population levels.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the two trends, and you've got one heck of a global
economic mess, economist Peter G. Peterson says. And the collision
date of those two global generational whirlwinds is coming up fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that global aging will become the transcendent
political and economic issue of the twenty-first century,''
Peterson writes. ``I will argue that _ like it or not, and there's
every reason to believe we won't like it _ renegotiating the
established social contract in response to global aging will soon
dominate and daunt the public policy agendas of all the developed
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson makes a compelling case in ``Gray Dawn: How the Coming
Age Wave Will Transform America _ and the World'' (Times Books, 280
pages, $23.00).
</P>
<P>
   This isn't Peterson's first sounding of alarm on the coming
geriatric generation.
</P>
<P>
   He began writing about the United States' Social Security system
in 1982, eventually leading to ``Will America Grow Up Before It
Grows Old?'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That book focused on the aging population of the United States.
Now, Peterson
</P>
<P>
   takes a global view.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are startling:
</P>
<P>
   _ Before the Industrial Revolution, less than 3 percent of the
world's population was 65 or older. Today, 14 percent are senior
citizens. By 2030, that number will soar to 25 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   _ Today, the ratio of working taxpayers to nonworking pensioners
is 3-1 in the developed world. By 2030, under the current
retirement system, that ratio will fall to 1.5-1, even lower in
Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   _ While the number of seniors ages 65 to 84 is projected to
triple within 50 years, the number of those over age 84 is expected
to grow sixfold. These ``old old'' will require twice as much
hospital care per person and more than 20 times as much nursing
home care as their younger senior counterparts in the United States
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson says the United States will fare better than some
countries, such as Italy and Japan, in the next few decades. But by
2030, the benefits of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and
federal and military pensions will exceed total revenues in this
country, according to a commission report that Peterson and others
prepared for Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would leave zero tax revenue for any other purpose _ not
even for interest payments, nor for national defense, nor for
education, nor for child health, nor for the federal payroll,''
Peterson writes. ```Not a penny available for anything else.'''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson outlines a somber but thoughtful view that appears to
be amply supported with analyses from distinguished sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely have so many official multilateral bodies _ such as the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development _ agreed with such
unanimity on the dimensions of a problem,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet little is being done to address this economic iceberg,
Peterson writes. He provides interesting overviews of how the
problem is surfacing in Japan, Italy, Latin America and Asia, as
well as America. Few politicians are facing the challenge, and
those who try are often voted out in the next election, he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson offers several suggestions for addressing the
generational problem. Among them are a major global aging summit of
world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have been willing to convene summits of this type to
discuss global `warming,''' he writes. ``Why not global `aging,'
which will hit us sooner and surer?''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, an Agency on Global Aging should be established to
share information, guidelines and initiatives, Peterson suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Other ideas include extending the work life of employees by
raising retirement ages so benefits don't kick in until later;
increasing immigration to the developed countries; encouraging
larger families with government benefits toward more children; and
applying benefits only to seniors who need financial help, not to
those with other incomes and savings.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson's book also looks at some of the lucrative markets to
be developed based on this demographic shift. Peterson provides
thoughtful ideas on a fascinating trend.

`CRUEL INTENTIONS': BACK TO THEIR OLD TRICKS, BUT A WHOLE LOT
YOUNGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something faintly ridiculous in the spectacle of Sarah
Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe portraying upscale Manhattan
teen-age versions of the manipulative sexual predators in Choderlos
de Laclos' 18th-century novel, ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching these fresh-faced actors go through the motions of
seducing and betraying their classmates at a fancy Manhattan
private school is rather like watching child actors playing
gangsters in Alan Parker's Prohibition-era movie ``Bugsy Malone.''
</P>
<P>
   You have the queasy sense that the whole thing is just an
elaborate stunt, and in this case an exploitative one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruel Intentions,'' written and directed by Roger Kumble, is
the fourth and by far the weakest film adaptation of Laclos'
epistolary novel. It is the second, following Roger Vadim's
European jet-set version (with Jeanne Moreau and Gerard Philipe as
a promiscuous married couple) to update it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Vadim adaptation (in 1960) had its ridiculous
moments, it at least had a couple of world-class sex symbols
pulling the strings.
</P>
<P>
   Making a teen-age soap opera out of a novel about jaded
sybarites corrupting younger people and comparing notes robs the
story of moral resonance. Ruining reputations, in any case, isn't
what it used to be, at least not in late-20th-century Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   And because ``Cruel Intentions'' is set in the age of the cell
phone and e-mail, you're continually aware of the contortions the
screenplay goes through to justify its characters' besieging one
another with handwritten notes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gellar and Phillippe are Kathryn and her step-brother,
Sebastian, a pair of spoiled preppy brats who live in a palatial
Manhattan apartment without noticeable parental supervision. The
two, who have been eyeing each other lustfully since their parents
met, have slept with everybody except each other.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon, Kathryn summons Sebastian and enlists him in a
vindictive kiss-and-tell scheme to seduce her ex-boyfriend's chaste
new girlfriend, Cecile (Selma Blair), and ruin her reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The two also make a diabolical wager. If Sebastian can seduce
Annette (Reese Witherspoon), the proudly chaste daughter of their
school's new headmaster, Kathryn will finally give herself to
Sebastian no holds barred. But if Sebastian fails, he must hand
over his most prized possession, a 1956 Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   Cecile turns out to be a piece of cake, but Annette presents a
major challenge. Having written an article for Seventeen magazine
urging girls to save themselves for marriage, she has a lot to lose
if Sebastian's campaign succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Cruel Intentions'' is all about teen-age sex, it isn't
especially sexy. Ms. Gellar's Kathryn is a snide, potty-mouthed
brat who always seems to be in a minor snit. Her coldly snippy
performance is enough to make you long for the young Tuesday Weld,
who lent her overprivileged teen-age wild girls an undercurrent of
destructive recklessness that made psychological sense.
</P>
<P>
   Phillippe's hushed, carefully elocuted speeches in ``Cruel
Intentions'' seem modeled after John Malkovich's mannered line
readings of Valmont in ``Dangerous Liaisons.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hampton's screenplay for that mostly wonderful movie
is also the obvious blueprint for Kumble's screenplay, which
self-consciously translates the dialogue into an arch,
profanity-laced modern teen-age argot. This version also throws in
half-baked subplots involving bisexuality and interracial sex.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's tone veers uncertainly between comedy and soap
opera. The opening scene, in which Swoosie Kurtz, as Sebastian's
psychiatrist, discovers to her horror that he seduced and abandoned
her daughter, is played for farce. After that the movie loses its
grin. The soberer it gets, the more forced and false it feels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruel Intentions is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and sexual
situations.
</P>

HIV PATIENT SUES DOCTOR WHO ADVISED AGAINST SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the pain in his shoulders became
unbearable, Steve Iacovino sought the help of a surgeon at the
University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But after the surgeon declined to operate, Iacovino said he was
so devastated that he wanted to throw himself off the roof of the
hospital parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he found another doctor and, a few months later,
successfully underwent shoulder replacement surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a trial under way before San Francisco Superior Court
Judge A. James Robertson II, Iacovino is suing the orthopedic
surgeon and the University of California alleging he was
discriminated against because he has the AIDS virus, or HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I begged him to do the surgery ... I saw no end to the pain,''
said Iacovino, 47, a former technician at the San Francisco Fine
Arts Museum who now lives in Honolulu. ``I figured if UC wasn't
going to operate on me no one would because they were the leading
AIDS experts. I thought my life was being written off.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lucey, the lawyer representing the now-retired surgeon,
Dr. Franklin Hoaglund, denied that the doctor discriminated against
Iacovino when he suggested a more conservative approach of physical
therapy instead of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every doctor has to be free to make medical judgments and
recommend treatment without fear of being sued simply because
another doctor disagrees with them,'' Lucey told the court
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Iacovino was diagnosed with irreversible bone
degeneration called avascular necrosis. Referred by his primary
physician to the university's orthopedics department, Iacovino was
taking heavy doses of morphine to combat the pain. He had tried
physical therapy, he said, but could not tolerate it.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, he met with Hoaglund and again the following
month.
</P>
<P>
   Iacovino said that because of the risk of infection from his
weakened immune system, the doctor advised against surgery. ``I
told him I was willing to take any risk, I did not want to live my
life on morphine,'' Iacovino said.
</P>
<P>
   Iacovino's lawyer, Gary Cloutier, said the refusal to operate
indicated that the surgeon ``didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucey, however, told the jury Wednesday that while Hoaglund has
treated HIV-positive patients, shoulder replacement surgery was
rarely done because of the serious risk of infection.
</P>
<P>
   Lucey said Iacovino also had medical complications other than
HIV and chronic shoulder pain, including herpes, headaches and
severe asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Hoaglund was sued for recommending a conservative course
of treatment,'' Lucey said. ``The plaintiff wanted the surgery and
he wanted it now ... you do not dictate to the doctor what
treatment should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months after Hoaglund declined to operate, Iacovino had the
surgery performed in Honolulu on his right shoulder. A second
operation was later performed on his left shoulder. Iacovino said
he is nearly off morphine and is again able to do most of the
activities he could not handle before the surgery.

WATER-RICH CANADA WARY OF THIRSTY US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Budgeted photo is unavailable.)  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Canada holds a fifth of the world's fresh water
supply, but doesn't want to share a drop, at least not for now. And
especially not with its increasingly thirsty neighbor to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated as much by raw nationalism as environmentalism, and
with an eye toward one day becoming the OPEC of H(2)O, Canada is
seeking to ban bulk sales of water to foreigners _ the first
``water-rich'' nation to attempt to block the flow of a resource
that some specialists predict will become the most valuable
commodity of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   With little fanfare and less public debate, Parliament last
month voted unanimously for a moratorium on bulk exports of water,
cloaking its action in Queen and flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water is as Canadian as hockey, as the Mounties, as the
beaver,'' said Bill Blaikie, a member of Parliament from Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   Said International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi: ``Canadians
feel extremely passionate about water.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it seemed a curious move for a country whose economy
depends heavily on extracting and exporting fabulous quantities of
non-renewable resources, from gold to natural gas. No one one seems
to worry too much about reserves of Canadian oil or iron ore, but
water gets the blood pumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't drink oil,'' explained Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's water, of course, is a resource that each hour
replenishes itself by the billions of gallons. Every day, the St.
Lawrence River alone disgorges into the Atlantic the equivalent of
10.1 million railroad tanker car loads of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   The vote by Parliament, although scarcely noticed outside
Ottawa, may turn out to have been the starting gun in a new global
scramble for resources.
</P>
<P>
   As the millenium approaches, the world's thirst for water is
growing at a stunning rate, with global demand doubling every 21
years. By the year 2025, the World Bank predicts, more than 3
billion people in 52 countries will suffer from chronic shortages
in water for drinking or sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   Even rich countries may be forced to reduce consumption
drastically _ especially agricultural use _ or search outside their
boundaries for sources of the life-giving liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Canada's extraordinary wealth of water, many
observers say the new moratorium is just a temporary stopgap,
giving Ottawa and the provinces time to devise a coherent water
policy _ and pricing strategy _ before opening the resource to the
highest bidders. They say Canada is less interested in keeping
water permanently away from bulk buyers than devising a plan to
circumvent the North American Free Trade Agreement and ensure that
Canadian companies _ not avaricious Americans _ profit most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada is a future OPEC of water,'' said Terence Corcoran,
business editor of the National Post, a Toronto-based daily
newspaper known for sober-minded financial coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Canada may even be moving on US water: a Canadian company has
quietly won the first North American license to ship bulk
quantities of drinking water to China _ from a pristine lake in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Global Water Corporation of Vancouver, British Columbia, in
a precedent-setting deal that attracted surprisingly little
attention, plans to siphon 18.2 billion gallons a year from Blue
Lake near Sitka, Alaska, for shipment to bottling plants in China,
one of the countries most threatened by looming shortages.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 report to shareholders, Global Water noted that
``consumption of water products is growing at a rate faster than
any beverage product.''
</P>
<P>
   Among environmentalists and economists, there is widespread
agreement that water shortages will become commonplace in the
coming decades, and that countries that control fresh water will be
kings of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 2010, Canada will be exporting large quantities of fresh
water to the US, and more by tanker to parched nations all over the
globe,'' Corcoran wrote in a recent article. ``The issue will not
be whether to export, but how much money the federal government and
the provinces will be able to extract from the shipments.''
</P>
<P>
   A study by the World Bank recently forecast that the planet's
rapidly expanding population will drain lakes and mighty rivers,
causing calamitous shortages of water for irrigation, drinking, and
sanitation. Water is being pumped at dangerous rates from exhausted
underground aquifiers throughout Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and
even parts of the United States, such as southern California and
several Midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for dwindling shares of the resource is already
intense, and could become ferocious. Stated the World Bank: ``Wars
of the next century will be over water.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's water moratorium, which has yet to be tested under free
trade treaties like NAFTA, is aimed straight at the United States,
where several businesses are quietly hatching plans to siphon off
shiploads of water from Canadian lakes for delivery to dusty
agricultural lands in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect has plainly spooked Canada. Politicians there vow
to protect the resource as nationalists thump up anti-American
sentiment by suggesting that their nation's pristine lakes and
rivers are about to be sucked dry by greedy US agribusiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing freaks out Canadians like the idea of American
supertankers coming in and taking off our water,'' said Maude
Barlow, head of the Council of Canadians, a nationalist lobbying
group that believes free trade treaties have left Canada vulnerable
to economic rape by its powerful neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water is our lifeblood,'' said Barlow, who favors a flat ban
on bulk water exports, except for humanitarian shipments. ``Once
the tap is open, no one can turn it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa is urging the 10 provinces, which share control of water
with the federal government, to help devise forceful strategies for
better guarding the nation's hoard.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the hullabaloo over water comes at a time of year
when Canadians from Niagara Falls to the high Arctic are hip deep
in the stuff, in the form of snow. Canada posseses the simple
compound of hydrogen and oxygen in more staggering abundance than
any other nation. Scientists estimate that 20 percent of the
earth's entire bounty of fresh water lies untouched in this country
of only 30 million people. Much of Canada remains virgin
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   A bit less than half of Canada's fresh water is renewable and,
at least theoretically, accessible from rivers, lakes, and
underground flows. The rest is so-called ``fossil water,'' locked
in glaciers and the permanent ice shield that covers the far north.
</P>
<P>
   On a per capita basis, Canada boasts 11 times as much renewable
fresh water as the United States: about 28.7 million gallons for
every woman, man, and child, compared to 2.6 million gallons per
American, according to UN figures.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens of the two countries are by far the world's most
prolifigate users of water, consuming 100 gallons per day per
person (Canada's average is slightly lower) _ most of it flushed
down the toilet or bath drain. The average person drinks only about
2 quarts per day.
</P>
<P>
   American/Canadian household consumption is nearly three times
higher than the European average, and 25 times greater than
personal consumption in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in rich and poor countries alike, water quaffed from
drinking glass or drawn into the bath is but a drop compared to the
stupefying amounts lavished on crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irrigation is far and away the biggest consumer of water
worldwide, accounting for about 80 percent of use,'' said Sandra
Postel, director of the Global Water Policy Project, a research
group based in Amherst, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, the most obvious new source is Canada,
which uses only the tiniest fraction of its available water to
slake its thirst, water its crops and turn the turbines of its
mammoth hydroelectric dams.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies clamoring for access to the water wealth of
the northern neighbor is Sun Belt Water Inc. of Santa Barbara,
which during the mid-1990s sought the right to ship tanker loads of
water from British Columbia to California. British Columbia killed
the deal and imposed a provincewide ban on bulk water exports. Sun
Belt is now seeking compensation of $220 million from Canada,
claiming the ban violates NAFTA, the free trade pact signed by the
United States, Canada, and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Trade specialists say that if Canada permits even a single
shipload of water to be exported, water will automatically become a
``tradeable commodity'' under NAFTA. That means US companies would
legally have the same rights as Canadian firms to exploit and
export the resource.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadian water would come under as much pressure as Canadian
culture is already under from the American juggernaut,'' warned
Barlow.

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AFFLICTION,' starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Willem Dafoe,
Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 114
minutes). Nolte is devastating in the performance of his career, as
Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing battle
with demons from his past. Foremost among them: Coburn,
terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago
cowed his sons into submission. As directed by Schrader, this pure,
unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks' novel starts on a
deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury.
Every little detail matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play
the women who trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BLAST FROM THE PAST,' starring Brendan Fraser, Christopher
Walken, Alicia Silverstone and Sissy Spacek. Directed by Hugh
Wilson (PG-13, 105 minutes). More amusingly than might be expected,
this comedy tells the story of one very nuclear family that has
been hiding in a fallout shelter since 1962 and emerges into a '90s
world of grunge and attitude. In fact, it's funnier underground,
with Fraser as the strapping son of a cheerfully mad scientist
(Walken) and sherry-sipping housewife (Ms. Spacek), 1962 style.
Once he comes above ground and meets a hard-boiled Ms. Silverstone,
it's clear that Fraser is once again a film's true ingenu, doing
the wide-eyed hunk thing that has become his specialty. He does it
a lot better in ``Gods and Monsters,'' but this comedy is still
lighthearted fun (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CENTRAL STATION,' starring Fernanda Montenegro. Directed by
Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian
gem, a joyless woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy. There's
plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles'
film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious
bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to
Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles brings
great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their
journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last
year's very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EIGHT MILLIMETER,'' starring Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix,
James Gandolfini and Catherine Keener. Directed by Joel Schumacher
(R, 120 minutes). This thriller delves into the perverse underworld
of the pornography business, shocking audiences with the
realization that sex and violence can be so dull. Cage, seriously
miscast, plays a private detective and devoted family man who is
suddenly, to his horror, drawn into the realm of porn. Naturally,
this is where the film wanted to be even when its opening scenes
were stuck in suburban Pennsylvania. But the story's parade of New
York and Hollywood sleazeballs fails to deliver either engaging
drama or heartfelt kinks. Phoenix is scene-stealingly good in a
sidekick's role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `JAWBREAKER,' starring Rose McGowan, Julie Benz, Rebecca
Gayheart and Judy Greer. Directed by Darren Stein (R, 85 minutes).
More nasty schoolgirls, and this time they're meant to be as hard
as the candy of the title. Intending more of a spoof than he
delivers, Stein introduces spike-heeled teen-age queens who
accidentally kill one of their own. Bummer! They spend the rest of
the story tarting up the class nerd so that she'll keep their
secret. This slender story is accompanied by lots of references to
other, better films in this genre, from ``Grease'' to ``Heathers,''
in a movie that (despite flashy directorial touches) doesn't show
much personality of its own. Special bonus: Marilyn Manson without
makeup is the guy in the bar (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE,' starring Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn
and Paul Newman. Directed by Luis Mandoki (PG-13, 110 minutes).
Nicholas Sparks' best-selling novel, about a lonely, sensitive man
who sends a message out to sea and the lonely, beautiful woman who
finds it, is now a long and soggy film. Kevin Costner crosses the
line from teasingly laconic to stodgy and seems as likely to have
written ``Bleak House'' as the love letter in question. Robin
Wright Penn makes an appealing heroine, but there's not much room
for real emotion in a film with the tenor of a commercial for
hazelnut-flavored coffee. As the hero's crusty old father, Newman
steals what's left of the show (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MY FAVORITE MARTIAN,' starring Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels
and Ray Walston. Directed by Donald Petrie (PG, 88 minutes).
Pixilated pixels and other up-to-the-minute moviemaking magic
manage the neat feat of turning the big-screen, resurrected ``My
Favorite Martian'' into an amiable family entertainment. In this
updated version of the 1960s CBS sitcom, Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara
(now a television newsman rather than a newspaper reporter) and
Christopher Lloyd as the visitor from another planet take over the
roles played by Bill Bixby and Ray Walston. In one of the happy and
logical little jokes that lend a disarming charm to the comedy,
Walston turns up once again in a welcome guise as government
bloodhounds set out to capture the Martian. But a good deal of the
fun in this tale is provided by Zoot, his high-spirited polymorphic
space suit (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `OCTOBER SKY,' starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper.
Directed by Joe Johnston (PG, 100 minutes). By far the most moving
scenes here are home movie snippets, circa 1957, that show the real
people on whom the film's characters are based. Otherwise, despite
being closely based on a best-selling memoir (``Rocket Boys'') by
the NASA engineer Homer H. Hickam Jr., this earnest, nostalgic film
has a way of seeming too good to be true. The film's simplicity is
appealing, as is Gyllenhaal in the central role of a boy in a West
Virginia coal mining town who becomes obsessed with rocketry. But
the story, filled with father-son conflict and down-in-the-ground
versus up-in-the-sky contrasts, often follows a familiar trajectory
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `PAYBACK,' starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry. Directed by
Brian Helgeland (R, 110 minutes). In this inept, excessively
sadistic film-noir spoof adapted from the same Richard Stark novel
(``The Hunter'') that inspired the 1967 genre classic ``Point
Blank,'' Gibson is a thief named Porter who retaliates with a
vengeance after an attempt on his life. Determined to recover
$70,000 that was stolen from him by a double-crossing partner in
crime, he works his way up the pecking order of a crime syndicate,
brutally dispatching all who stand in his way. The hard-boiled
dialogue is ludicrous, the storytelling clunky, the acting fair to
awful, the gore ankle deep. Credit the star with being able to keep
a straight face through this loathsome mess (Stephen Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `RUSHMORE,' starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia
Williams. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 93 minutes). A dryly
hilarious portrait of the mogul as a young man, with Schwartzman a
real find as its perfectly horrid little hero, Max Fischer. Max's
prep school, Rushmore Academy, does have a faculty, but none of the
grown-ups have anything like Max's natural authority. Murray is
sneakily fine as the steel tycoon and Rushmore benefactor who
happens to be on Max's own wavelength as they vie for the same
beautiful teacher. A particular treat for its skewed, outrageously
funny memories of a cutthroat boyhood (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE,' starring Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth
Paltrow. Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy
and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise
that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay,
originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard
into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his ``Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine whatever it likes about
the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad
yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile this
tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater
fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and
has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo and Juliet,''
glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous
duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring
performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TANGO,' starring Miguel Angel Sola. Written and directed by
Carlos Saura. Cinematography by Vittorio Storaro (PG-13, 100
minutes). A thrilling display of tango heat and virtuosity. And
it's no slight to the actors who play lovers to say that the
dancing here is steamier than any kiss. In his most electrifying
dance film Saura offers transfixingly beautiful glimpses of the
dance and the great range of emotions it can conjure. Storaro's
dazzlingly fluid cinematography captures all the nuances this
material demands. Everyone in the film is utterly consumed by tango
fever; audiences will be, too (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE THIN RED LINE,' starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick
Nolte and Sean Penn. Directed by Terrence Malick (R, 166 minutes).
From the first frame of this huge, drifting war epic loosely
derived from James Jones' Guadalcanal novel, it's viscerally clear
that Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached visual style
that made ``Badlands'' and ``Days of Heaven'' the most beautiful
films of the 1970s is instantly apparent here, even if the
narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar. The
film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual poetry,
the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter editing.
Bottom line: No one who admired Malick's early work should miss
this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it here
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `20 DATES,' starring Myles Berkowitz. Directed by Berkowitz (R,
88 minutes). The filmmaker's gimmick is to make a film about
dating. His goal: To go out with 20 different women, get them on
camera by any means necessary and promise to fall in love with one
before the experiment is over. Berkowitz, pesty and proud of it,
has absorbed enough of Jerry Seinfeld and Garry Shandling to create
a diffident, nit-picking, sitcom-ready persona. But whenever his
film establishes a playful mood, it's liable to do something to
make you squirm. Crassness and mock candor aren't all that funny
(unless they're coming from Albert Brooks, whose ``Real Life''
paved the way for this). And discovering that cheese makes
Berkowitz constipated, or that one of his dates disappoints him by
not looking enough like Jessica Rabbit, is more than you need to
know (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `200 CIGARETTES,' starring Paul Rudd, Kate Hudson, Ben Affleck,
Janeane Garofalo and Courtney Love, Directed by Risa Bramon Garcia
(R, 102 minutes). This contrived but cheery party movie marks the
feature directing debut of a well-known casting director. And in
making her film, Ms. Garcia does what she does best: cast. A group
of bright young players is brought together for a largely plotless
New Year's Eve, rambling around a colorfully evoked East Village,
circa 1981. Essentially just a set of interwoven skits, this comedy
still makes good use of the actors noted above, along with Casey
Affleck as a nice-guy punk, Dave Chappelle as a cabbie full of
advice and Martha Plimpton as a hopeless hostess. Ms. Hudson, who
is Goldie Hawn's daughter and has her mother's grin and giggle,
makes an adorable debut despite spending part of the movie with dog
excrement on her coat (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   Film Series:
</P>
<P>
   `THE BILLY ROSE TRIBUTE TO EDWARD G. ROBINSON.' At 30, he made
his film debut, playing an old man in ``The Bright Shawl'' in 1923.
He didn't make another film for six years. But before his career
ended, he performed in some 80 films across five decades in roles
that ranged from ruthless gangster to man of science to introverted
accountant. His name was Edward G. Robinson (1893-1973). He spoke
eight languages, amassed a famous collection of French
Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art and denounced racism and
fascism. Now he is the subject of a retrospective of 27 features,
plus live-action shorts and animated films, at the Museum of Modern
Art. ``Robinson's type of stardom, unlike that of the romantic
leading man, enabled him to create complex, memorable personalities
in later supporting as well as principal roles,'' says Mary Lea
Bandy, the chief curator of the museum's Department of Film and
Video and an organizer of the retrospective. Among this weekend's
attractions, at 5 p.m. Sunday, is Fritz Lang's ``Scarlet Street''
(1946), with Robinson as an unhappily married company cashier whose
passion for a scheming young woman enmeshes him in embezzlement and
murder. Continuing through April 12 at the museum, the series, a
collaboration between the museum and the Billy Rose Foundation, is
free with museum admission: $9.50 for adults, $6.50 for students
and those 65 or older; free for members and visitors under 16
accompanied by an adult. Pay what you wish on Fridays from 4:30 to
8:30 p.m. Screening information: (212) 708-9400 (Van Gelder).

NEWS OF THE GREAT WHITE WAY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The foundering of ``Titanic,'' which said this week
that it will close at the end of March, has left the Lunt-Fontanne
Theater, one of Broadway's prime locales for big-budget musicals,
suddenly up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   One seriously discussed option is that ``Beauty and the Beast,''
at the Palace Theater, would be transferred to the Lunt-Fontanne to
make way for Disney's new musical project, ``Aida,'' which is
aiming for a Broadway opening in spring 2000. Disney executives had
no comment on the possible deal, although officials for Nederlander
Organization, which owns both the Lunt-Fontanne and the Palace,
confirmed that talks were under way.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nederlanders are also considering booking a fall musical
rather than leaving their theater dark for an entire year, said
Nick Scandalios, the organization's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Among the musicals mentioned to be looking for a home in the
fall, although not necessarily at the Lunt-Fontanne, are a planned
revival of ``The Music Man'' and a current tour of ``Evita,'' as
well as several new works. ``Music Man'' is being produced by
Dodger Theatricals, which also produced ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Scandalios cautioned that any speculation was premature. The
first step for the Lunt-Fontanne, after ``Titanic,'' will be a
lengthy dismantling of the show's equipment, including its huge
mechanized set. That process, plus cleanup and repairs, is expected
to take several months.
</P>
<P>
   Dancing on the Rules
</P>
<P>
   The news that ``Rollin' on the T.O.B.A.'' will be moving to the
Kit Kat Klub, on West 43rd Street in Manhattan, promises to set off
another hot debate over the Tony Awards' famously flexible
eligibility standards.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``T.O.B.A.,'' a well-reviewed look at the songs
and experiences from the heyday of black vaudeville, have already
written to the Tony Administration Committee seeking a special
dispensation for the show. Their argument is that because the Kit
Kat Klub, formerly the Henry Miller Theater, was the initial home
of the production of ``Cabaret'' that was deemed eligible by the
committee last year, so should ``T.O.B.A.'' be considered eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how you can say during one year that a show
in a theater is eligible, and the next year another show isn't,''
said Ashton Springer, the show's producer.
</P>
<P>
   But Keith Sherman, a Tony spokesman, said the decision on
``Cabaret'' dealt only with that production, and that the Kit Kat
Klub itself was not an eligible theater. The club's owners are also
seeking permanent eligibility, though that decision, even if
approved, would not be in effect until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the committee's 24 members said that in winning
eligibility, ``Cabaret'' had several advantages over ``T.O.B.A.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabaret'' was a production of Roundabout Theater Company, an
established Broadway producer and a proprietor of Stage Right, at
the Criterion Center, a Tony-eligible theater; ``T.O.B.A.'' has
independent, lesser-known producers. ``Cabaret'' also had the
advantage of having been produced, to good reviews, in London, and
of starring Natasha Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said the Tony administrators would consider the request
soon. ``Every year there are a few situations that the rules don't
address,'' he said. ``That's why we meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer said he was simply pleased by the turn of events for
``T.O.B.A.,'' which began last fall at the Billie Holiday Theater
in Brooklyn before transferring to the 47th Street Theater. ``I
never in a trillion years was thinking about it going on to
Broadway,'' Springer said. ``We would have been happy to get
nominated for an Obie.''
</P>
<P>
   Not About Hair
</P>
<P>
   Finbar Lynch says one of the acute dangers of acting is boredom
_ not only for audiences but for actors. ``If you're just churning
out the same thing night after night,'' Lynch said, ``you're going
to go nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows of what he speaks. An actor since he was 18, Lynch, now
36, has enjoyed long runs in several shows at the Royal Shakespeare
Company in London. Currently he's earning strong reviews as Jim
Allison, the book-smart convict in Tennessee Williams' prison
melodrama, ``Not About Nightingales,'' at the Circle in the Square
Theater, after a run last summer at the Alley Theater in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The actor said he had experimented with his role since the
summer. But not all his efforts have been rousing successes. During
previews for ``Nightingales,'' Lynch tried out a new wig for his
character. ``I thought it might be a good idea to have a bit of
hair,'' he said. ``It was sort of public-school boy look.''
</P>
<P>
   But he decided that ``it was ridiculous,'' he said. ``I felt I
was in a different play, `Arcadia,' or something. I wouldn't have
lasted 10 seconds in prison with that hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch has also changed his name since his last appearance in New
York, in 1996, during a tour of ``A Midsummer's Night Dream.'' At
that point he was going by his nickname, Barry. That, too, had
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to get fan letters for an actor named Barry Lynch who
was on `Star Trek,''' he said. ``And when I was in England, I used
to get letters for a diet doctor named Barry Lynch with checks
inside.'' He added, ``I did not cash them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard? Is That You?
</P>
<P>
   It was an unexpected Broadway debut. On Tuesday night, midway
through Act II of ``Death of a Salesman,'' the actor Richard
Thompson, who plays Bernard, was felled by food poisoning and
missed an entrance. After several moments of watching the actors ad
lib onstage (``Bernard? Bernard, where are you?''), the stage
manager stopped the show and brought up the house lights.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, on came Steve Cell, Thompson's understudy,
who had been on call in a basement green room. His first scene was
with the show's star, Brian Dennehy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just looked at him and said, `Be with the guy,''' Cell said.
</P>
<P>
   Cell received a special ovation during the curtain call.
Thompson, who went to the hospital on Tuesday night, returned to
the show for the Wednesday matinee.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As video sales on the Internet rise, it's good to see old-line
purveyors _ those with paper catalogs in the two-to-three-pound
range _ holding their own, not only between covers but on the Web
as well.
</P>
<P>
   To be respectable in video mail order these days, one needs at
least 40,000 titles. Movies Unlimited, a large Philadelphia
distributor, packs that many in a fat catalog that can now be found
on the Internet at www.mostmovies.com.
</P>
<P>
   Like other sites, this one has specific strengths. Built over 20
years, the collection at one time or another has gotten into every
nook and cranny of a genre or career, at least as it exists on
video. Search John Wayne, for example, and you come up with more
than 200 entries from feature films to television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Another virtue of the large older mail order operation is that
over the years it has accumulated a wide assortment of titles that
are no longer in distribution and probably never will be again. If
you've been told a film isn't available, perhaps Movies Unlimited
has a copy available.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``Absolute Beginners'' (1985), a look at the London
fashion world of 1958 (with a soundtrack by David Bowie and
others), is $35.99, which is a representative price for these
few-of-a-kind videos. That's $35.99 used, it should be added. Many
of the cassettes were in rental circulation years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company says that tapes are in very good shape unless
otherwise stated. Prices vary according to a title's past
popularity, present rarity and condition. ``The American Friend''
(1977), Wim Weders' highly regarded film noir starring Dennis
Hopper and Bruno Ganz, is $53.99 used, another typical price.
</P>
<P>
   But choice obviously recommends a catalog or Web inventory.
Perhaps the most unusual selection belongs to Facets International,
a Chicago distributor. Last week Facets issued its very large
(10-by-15-inch, 625-page) paper catalog. Jump into it at random,
and there is Victor Sjostrom's ``Secret of the Monastery'' (1919),
and Henry Jaglom's ``Babyfever'' (1995) and Jack Arnold's
``Tarantula'' (1955).
</P>
<P>
   The catalog can also be found at the Facets site,
www.facets.org, where this week the noted selections include
Mitchell Leisen's 1934 comedy ``Death Takes a Holiday'' and George
Romero's second film, ``There's Always Vanilla'' (1971).
</P>
<P>
   The catalog is edited by Milos Stehlik, Facets' video director.
``The Internet has helped people become aware of these films,'' he
said. ``That leads to sophisticated specialized collecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hopeful sign for a broader selection, he said, is
increased activity by smaller independent distributors like Fox
Lorber, First Run, Kino, Water Bearer and Home Vision. All are
putting out more high-grade independent and foreign films, like
Abbas Kiarostami's acclaimed ``Taste of Cherry,'' an Iranian film
about a man's search for someone to go to the cemetery and bury him
after he has committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Home Vision is to release the movie next month. It was shown at
the New York Film Festival in 1997 and made a brief theater
appearance. ``People are looking to video for these kinds of
films,'' Stehlik said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slam
</P>
<P>
   It's fitting that the verbal competitions called slams _
head-to-head clashes of rap, performance art and stand-up comedy _
have their own movie to do for this rhythmically charged, fervently
incantatory street poetry what ``Saturday Night Fever'' did for
disco in the 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Joshua (Saul Williams, left) makes a charismatic young black
inner city hero. Around the housing project known as Dodge City,
Ray's mild-mannered intelligence makes him something of a mythic
being, but that doesn't keep him out of prison for possession of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Behind bars he writes poetry, develops his delivery to
mesmerizing effect and meets a young woman (Sonja Sohn), a slammer
herself, who teaches a writing class. Later on the outside she
invites Ray on stage, where he ``kills'' (slamese for knocks them
dead).
</P>
<P>
   This may be rose-colored, but ``what `Slam' possesses,'' Stephen
Holden wrote in The New York Times, ``is a real passion, and that
is in short supply in movies these days.'' &QL;

   What Dreams May Come &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How about this for movie pathos? Two children die in a car
accident, leaving the mother in a suicidal depression. The father
rallies the mother, but he gets killed in an accident so she
commits suicide anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And now everything points to a big rendezvous in the hereafter.
Annie (Annabella Sciora), a painter in life, has landed in
purgatory for taking her own life. Chris (Robin Williams, all
crinkly and misty-moisty) is upstairs in a golden kingdom bathed in
glorious light, a sort of hallucinatory extension of the physical
world he left behind when he was still a talented pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Chris goes below to look for Annie (with Max von Sydow
as a grim guide called The Tracker). That they get their reunion is
fair enough, but in the process too much about these people and
their children is crammed into too little space, and all the
weeping and hugging can't make up for a ``fatal lack of texture and
psychological nuance'' (Holden). &QL;

   Ever After: A Cinderella Story
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later she had to happen: a Cinderella who makes it on
guts and drive and not on just foot size and a boost from her fairy
godmother. This Cinderella (Drew Barrymore) rises from her humble
station to become a princess in 16th-century France.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being saved by the prince (Dougray Scott), this
Cinderella turns the tables, saving her wimpy consort from a band
of outlaws in the forest. A princess with very progressive ideas,
she gets her in-laws to pay for a university with a library for all
the people.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the charmed couple have wed, she has schooled the
prince in the harsh political realities from which his privileged
life has shielded him. The problem is that as refreshing as this
is, the movie ``never makes up its mind whether it's a spoof, a
soap opera or a feminist pep talk'' (Holden). &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a Broadway season packed with Electra, the Lomans
and other gloomy characters, the true master of existential angst
just may be a 5-year-old cartoon malcontent by the name of Sally
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was jumping rope, everything seemed fine,'' says Sally, in a
martini-dry deadpan. ``And suddenly, it all seemed so futile.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress responsible for Sally's delectable depression is
Kristin Chenoweth, a diminutive 28-year-old who has been receiving
some of the season's best reviews as Charlie Brown's kid sister in
the revival of ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' playing at the
Ambassador Theater on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Among others, Ben Brantley of The New York Times said that Ms.
Chenoweth was giving ``one of those break-out performances that
send careers skyward'' and compared her to a young Bernadette
Peters. John Simon, the theater critic for New York magazine,
called her performance ``perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which, Ms. Chenoweth said, took her by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word shock is an understatement,'' she said of the
aftermath of opening night. ``I got a phone call at about 3 that
morning from a friend in California, and he was screaming, `You
haven't read the reviews?' I said, `No.' He said, `You need to read
them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ms. Chenoweth has been sought after by casting
directors, film studio executives and Broadway producers.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews and subsequent attention have made her happy _ ``I'd
be lying if I said they didn't'' _ but Ms. Chenoweth said her
initial reaction was mixed because the musical received less
positive notices than she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really could have been horrendous to be singled out,'' she
said. ``I just didn't want anyone else to hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   But her collaborators on ``Charlie Brown'' say Ms. Chenoweth's
appeal in the role was evident even before the show came to
Broadway, when it was on a tryout run in four cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on the bus in Skokie, and she was flooring all of
us,'' said Michael Mayer, the musical's director. ``It was so clear
to everyone that she was going to be a major player.''
</P>
<P>
   A player is probably not the first thing that would come to mind
when meeting Ms. Chenoweth. Just under five feet tall, she has blue
eyes, blond hair and a smile that could charm a pit bull.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of view this job like a playground for me,'' she said.
``I just play.''
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma native with vestiges of a Southern accent, Ms.
Chenoweth has had a life colored by a wide spectrum of all-American
experiences, from her early dreams of being a Nashville music star
to a stint as a beauty queen contestant.
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite leisure activity is shopping, she said, preferably
in malls. Her first serious boyfriend was a professional baseball
player. ``I think he thought this was going to be a hobby,'' she
said of her theater career.
</P>
<P>
   She delicately sidesteps the trappings of young divahood. She
doesn't especially like fancy restaurants, she said, preferring
fast food. ``I like places where the food's ready when you walk
in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her dressing room holds an array of high kitsch, ranging from a
set of Sally Christmas lights to a small futon adorned with Barbie
sheets, a gift from her cast mate, B.D. Wong., who plays Linus.
</P>
<P>
   This all might make her easy to pigeonhole as a Kewpie doll,
except that her colleagues also point to an enormous talent and
uncanny comic timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much more than meets the eye,'' Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because of the way she looks, people think A, she's
dumb and B, she doesn't know what she's doing up there. But it's
not a coincidence what's happening up there. She's a smart, smart
performer.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also hints of the subversive, if inadvertent, wit that
permeates the personality of her stage character.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I really like to read?'' said Ms. Chenoweth with
a smile. ``Books about disaster. I love shows like `Rescue 911.' My
dream in life is to be in a 7-Eleven and to see someone I saw the
night before on `America's Most Wanted.''' Then she adds, eyes
glinting, ``I want to find a fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Her aspirations in law enforcement aside, Ms. Chenoweth's has
seen a steady succession of meaty roles.
</P>
<P>
   Her New York debut came in early 1997 as a tear-prone princess
in Moliere's ``Scapin,'' with Bill Irwin at the Roundabout's Laura
Pels Theater. Several critics noted her comic timing, a talent she
said she developed partly because of Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Irwin kind of taught me how to act,'' she said. ``I'd had
acting classes, but the main teaching came through that
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, she appeared in the short-lived Broadway musical
``Steel Pier,'' and made a well-received turn in ``Strike Up the
Band'' at City Center's Encores concert series in 1998. Last summer
she appeared in ``A New Brain'' a musical by William Finn, at
Lincoln Center Theater.
</P>
<P>
   It was around that time that Mayer cast Ms. Chenoweth in
``Charlie Brown,'' but not as Sally. The character didn't exist in
the original version of the musical; Ms. Chenoweth was to play
Peppermint Patty.
</P>
<P>
   But the more Mayer looked at Ms. Chenoweth, he said, the more he
wanted to do something new.
</P>
<P>
   So Mayer, with the blessing of Charles M. Schulz, the creator of
the ``Peanuts'' comic strip on which the musical is based,
discarded Patty and brought the character of Sally to the stage by
culling dialogue from hundreds of Schulz's strips. He had Ms.
Chenoweth in mind, and she was an easy fit.
</P>
<P>
   Wong said: ``She really is nailing something about Sally that is
innately in her. One of the things Kristin says all the time is, `I
don't like it one bit,' and that's the aspect of her personality
she's exploited for the part. It's a kind of willingness to be
petulant in a really childlike way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayer said, ``Kristin's got this comic ruthlessness.'' He added,
``She's just one of those performers who'll stop at nothing to make
it work.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chenoweth's first taste of performance came singing as a
child in her hometown church in Broken Arrow, Okla., a Tulsa
suburb. Raised as a Southern Baptist, she still attends church
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   She said her parents, ``a chemical engineer and a domestic
goddess,'' were surprised by her early talents. ``I came from a
family of intellectual beings,'' she said. ``And then there's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her childhood idols were female vocalists, ranging from Judy
Garland and Julie Andrews to Dolly Parton and gospel singer Sandi
Patti. At around age 7, Ms. Chenoweth began recording her songs,
thoughts and observations on a portable tape recorder. She still
has the tapes and they sound remarkably like Sally.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom, she's a gripe,'' said a young Kristin on one tape. ``I
never heard so much gripe.'' The other side of the tape has a young
Ms. Chenoweth performing in a make-believe show called ``Fun With
My Flute.''
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Ms. Chenoweth pursued a singing career and very
nearly ran off to Nashville to do so, when her father insisted she
go to college. She enrolled in Oklahoma City University, a private
college with a large dance and musical theater program.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Ms. Chenoweth began to study opera, deepening and
strengthening a voice that was rapidly approaching a four-octave
range. She also began studying acting and doing summer stock
theater.
</P>
<P>
   She began another pursuit as well. ``I was Miss OCU and
runner-up Miss Oklahoma in 1991,'' she said. ``It was for money for
college.''
</P>
<P>
   She would need it. After finishing her undergraduate degree, Ms.
Chenoweth earned a master's degree in opera performance at Oklahoma
City in 1995. She was accepted by the Academy of Vocal Arts in
Philadelphia for further training. But before beginning classes,
she went to New York to help a friend move in.
</P>
<P>
   While in New York, two weeks before the term was to begin, Ms.
Chenoweth decided on a whim to audition for a role in the Marx
Brothers' ``Animal Crackers'' at the Paper Mill Playhouse in
Millburn, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, she was surprised by the reaction. ``I just decided
to do it to see how I would do,'' she said. ``And then I got it.''
</P>
<P>
   To her parents' dismay, she took the part and abandoned her
opera aspirations. The role led to other jobs in regional theater
and, eventually, to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   And from there? Since being anointed as a star in the making,
Ms. Chenoweth said she has been approached about acting in several
television shows and films and is interested in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   But not for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only every so often you get to play a part like this,''
she said. ``I'm kind of enjoying playing a grump.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' is playing at the
Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th St., Manhattan, on Wednesdays at
2 and 7:30 p.m., Thursdays at 7:30 p.m., Fridays at 8 p.m.,
Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. and Sundays at 1 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets
are $30 to $75. Telephone: (212) 239-6200.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Driving south on Utah's Highway 59, you slip out of the
subdivisions sprouting in the desert, ascend to a lonely stretch of
ink-colored juniper trees, then suddenly find yourself at the edge
of the last century. There on the Arizona border, tucked behind
towering flanks of red rock, is a town of about 5,000 people. Most
are Mormon fundamentalists, and most are outlaws: It is the largest
polygamous community in the United States.
 &HT;    Though polygamy is a felony, nobody has to hide from the law in
this town, called Hildale on the Utah side of the state line,
Colorado City on the other. More than a century after it was
outlawed, polygamy is flourishing in Utah and small pockets of the
American West, nurtured by religious directives and the hands-off
stance of legal authorities.
 &HT;    Laura Chapman, 36, is the 25th child from a family with four
mothers and 31 children, and she knows most of the people in
Hildale and Colorado City, even the few she is not related to by
blood. Chapman left the town years ago _ she calls it ``the land
that time forgot.'' Today she is one of a new group of women who
have fled plural families and want to draw attention to the reality
of modern polygamy.
 &HT;    Forget the sepia-toned notion of kindly Mormon patriarchs
frolicking with a bushel of happy wives, these women say. Forget
about the polygamy of Abraham or the Mormon pioneer Brigham Young.
 &HT;    Late-20th-century polygamy, practiced by people who seem
unconcerned about the law or public opinion, is a Dark Ages hybrid,
say women who have left the big families. They raise allegations of
sexual abuse, pedophilia and incest.
 &HT;    ``This is organized crime, operating under the cover of
religion,'' Chapman maintains.
 &HT;    If the charges of women such as Chapman have been shrugged off
before, that may be about to change. Last year a teen-age girl
emerged with a story of incest, child abuse and forced marriage at
the hands of one of Utah's biggest polygamous clans, the Kingstons
_ who are based right in Salt Lake City, within a few miles of the
domed capital building.
 &HT;    Whatever the outcome, Chapman and other ex-wives of polygamy
hope the resulting trials, scheduled to begin in April, will force
a reckoning with Utah's oldest ghost.
 &HT;    After the Mormon Church denounced polygamy and Utah outlawed it
in 1896 _ Washington had made this a condition of statehood - it
was thought that the practice of taking multiple wives would
ultimately disappear. But a century later the opposite has
happened, with anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 people living in
families where one man is married to 2, 3, 5, as many as 30 women.
 &HT;    No one has been prosecuted for polygamy in Utah for nearly 50
years, and the state's power structure has not made enforcement an
issue. Last year Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a Republican who is
himself a descendant of polygamists, even said the practice is not
often prosecuted in part because ``these people have religious
freedoms'' (a statement he later amended in the wake of a public
outcry).
 &HT;    The practice is still a minority one in this state of 2 million
people, of course, and the mainstream Mormon leadership in Salt
Lake City strongly condemns it. But it survives in ``clans'' _
massive patriarchal cabals linked by bloodlines and business ties,
whose members generally tithe 10 percent of all wages and earnings
to their church.
 &HT;    Those leaders insist that their only crime is following the true
word of God _ they see the church's capitulation on polygamy as a
blasphemous mistake. Sexual abuse is rare, they insist, and when it
occurs it is not tolerated.
 &HT;    There are at least four major clans in Utah. One of these
polygamous empires, based about 40 minutes south of Salt Lake, in
Bluffdale, is run by Owen Allred, age 84. The state has long
estimated its membership at about 5,000 people.
 &HT;    But Janet Bennion, a Utah Valley State College anthropologist
who spent five years studying the Allreds for a recent book,
``Women of Principle'' (Oxford University Press), says the number
is closer to 10,000, with clusters all over the West.
 &HT;    At the Allred compound, the headquarters is a huge, windowless
two-story building facing the Wasatch mountain range. Arrayed
around it are massive houses, with two or three minivans in many of
the driveways.
 &HT;    Lillian Bowles spent most of her life on this patch of arid
land. She grew up in a trailer not far from Bluffdale's church, one
of 40 children in a family in which her mother was one of eight
wives. She is not even sure where she fits in the family
chronology. ``I think I'm No. 17,'' she says. She remembers a life
of claustrophobia and fear of the outside world. ``I knew early on
that what we were doing was against the law,'' says Bowles, who is
26. ``We were always taught to hide. We couldn't play in the front
yard. When we drove somewhere, it was always 'Duck!' when you
passed a police car.''
 &HT;    At 16, she wanted to leave. But like other women who have fled
polygamy, she says she had no idea how to. ``We were taught early
on that we were God's chosen people, and everyone else was
condemned to hell. If you left, you were condemned.''
 &HT;    At age 17, she married a man who told her it was better to get
married young, rather than wait to be a third or fourth bride.
After six years of marriage, she says, Bowles left her husband when
he decided take on another wife.
 &HT;    Rowenna Erickson, 59, told me a similar tale when she described
her life within another major clan, the Kingstons. She married her
brother-in-law, Charles L. Kingston, and produced eight children.
 &HT;    ``The other wives kept telling me how this was all so wonderful
because we were going to heaven,'' she says between baby-sitting
chores for grandchildren in Salt Lake City. ``But if it was so
wonderful, how come I felt so horrible?''
 &HT;    I asked her if she was ever in love with her husband. ``It was
business,'' she says. ``Produce the babies. Don't question your
husband. But still, you get jealous. I remember when my husband had
his eyes on a very young girl. My sister and I were so hurt.''
 &HT;    She went on to explain a marital routine I heard from members of
polygamous families all over Utah, a sexual-rotation schedule with
all the romance of being a hen at a poultry ranch. ``When you're
ovulating, the patriarch is called,'' she says.
 &HT;    Polygamous leaders tend to shrug off stories such as those told
by Bowles, Erickson and Chapman, dismissing them as bitterness with
a political agenda. But they may have a more difficult time
explaining away an episode that rocked Utah last spring, when a
sobbing, badly bruised 16-year-old girl placed a 911 call from a
truck stop in northern Utah.
 &HT;    She told the police a story of indentured barbarism, alleging
her father had forced her into becoming the 15th wife of her uncle.
When she tried to flee, she maintained, she was whisked to a family
ostrich ranch, taken into a barn and whipped by her father.
 &HT;    The leaders of the Kingston clan run one of the biggest and
wealthiest family business empires in Utah. With 1,500 members and
interests in everything from restaurants to casinos, the clan is
worth $150 million or more, state officials estimate. The clan
operates much of its business out of an old brick office on State
Street just outside downtown Salt Lake City. The building has no
identification on the outside, save an address.
 &HT;    In a December pretrial hearing, the girl gave a hint of what her
life was like inside the clan. Her marriage was arranged by her
father and uncle; the latter had sex with her the first time at her
mother's home.
 &HT;    ``I guess it was my night, so he came over,'' the girl
testified. Then she was moved into a small apartment, with another
wife, one door away from a third wife. All the while, the girl
said, she was terrified. ``I felt trapped.''
 &HT;    The girl's uncle David O. Kingston has been charged with three
counts of incest and one count of unlawful sexual conduct. Her
father, John D. Kingston, has been charged with child abuse. The
two brothers will be tried separately in April, and both have
pleaded not guilty. (The father's lawyer _ and cousin _ Carl E.
Kingston refused to talk to me.)
 &HT;    But even in the face of the girl's court testimony that she had
been forced to marry her uncle and join 14 other wives, the state
has chosen not to bring polygamy charges.
 &HT;    State officials insist the law is unenforceable because most
polygamists have a marriage certificate only for the first bride;
the others are sealed in church ceremonies, without a paper trail
necessary for proof of crime.
 &HT;    The last major attempt at prosecuting anyone on polygamy charges
was in 1953, in Hildale/Colorado City _ then called Short Creek. A
big raid on the compound was written about and photographed by Life
magazine, and what resultd was a furor over families being torn
apart by the state.
 &HT;    Last year, six women from plural marriages _ including Bowles,
Erickson and Chapman _ founded one of the most unusual private
outreach groups in the country, an advocacy organization called
Tapestry of Polygamy. When such women hear Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah
intone about the sanctity of law and President Clinton's sexual
misdeeds, they want to shout from the top of the Mormon Temple:
``What about polygamy?''
 &HT;    Prompted in part by Tapestry, the state attorney general's
office recently sent emissaries to the Allred compound to discuss
things such as statutory rape, child abuse, the minimum wage and
other basic legal facts of modern American life. They gave out
phone numbers. According to the attorney general's office, dozens
of calls have come in _ women and children asking basic questions
about the outside world.
 &HT;    When Chief Deputy Attorney General Reed Richards said last year
that polygamy was not only nearly impossible to prosecute but,
technically, not a crime at all, it took the largely poor and
unschooled ex-wives of polygamous men to point out the law to him.
Polygamy is in fact covered by the statute that makes bigamy a
felony, the women noted, and the law says nothing about a marriage
certificate being needed for proof of crime, only that a husband or
wife ``purports to marry another person.''
 &HT;    I read that statute to Richards and mentioned that prominent
polygamists in Utah had their own Web sites and seemed to be
bragging about breaking the law. One man, Graydon Henderson, whom I
spoke to, lives openly with his five wives and 21 children in a
suburb just south of Salt Lake.
 &HT;    ``I'm not a bit afraid of the law,'' he told me. ``It's not even
worth worrying about.'' Richards finally said that he has no idea
why polygamy was not prosecuted in his state. But he added, ``If we
cracked down on it, I think it would all go underground.''
 &HT;    In Hildale/Colorado City today and in the Allred and Kingston
compounds, residents consider themselves the followers of the true
Mormon Church. In their view, the heretics are the ones operating
out of Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake.
 &HT;    On a tour of Temple Square, the global headquarters of the
Mormon religion, one of the fastest-growing in the world, I asked
the guide about the wives of Brigham Young, a founder of the Mormon
Church. We were in a former home of Young's, the Beehive House,
about a block from the Temple, and the guide was explaining how the
patriarch's wife made bread.
 &HT;    ``Which wife?'' I asked. Young had 27.
 &HT;    ``These other wives were mostly widows,'' the tour guide
replied.
 &HT;    But that sort of historical revisionism ends up infuriating both
the women who have fled polygamy and the people who defend it.
 &HT;    Chapman wants Utah's Mormons to acknowledge that some of their
most revered founding fathers had child brides. Fundamentalists
want the basic facts of the polygamists' past to remain a central
part of the Mormon narrative.
 &HT;    What seems to interest outsiders the most about polygamy is the
sex. The famed 19th-century eroticist, Sir Richard Burton, traveled
to Utah to have a firsthand look at a practice he considered quite
natural. Some people who defend modern polygamy take the same
approach, saying men are, after all, promiscuous animals by nature.
 &HT;    ``You look at the nature of men, and most of them are
polygamous,'' says Mary Potter, who was once one of three wives of
a policeman in a Salt Lake City suburb. (The family later split
up.) She has now formed a group in support of plural marriages, and
openly frets about ``having to wear a Scarlet P,'' as she calls the
cries for legal action. ``In polygamy, men are properly
channeled.''
 &HT;    She and other supporters of polygamy point to recent studies
that maintain that men are evolutionally wired for multiple sexual
partners. ``There's a desire on the part of men to have a diversity
of mates _ it's their natural urge _ so sex is definitely a
motivating factor for many of the patriarchs,'' Bennion says.
 &HT;    Viagra has been a blessing for a few of the older patriarchs,
she also notes. ``Some members of the Allred group are using Viagra
because they just can't keep up with their younger wives,'' she
says. ``There is a big age difference for many of these men. If
you've got three or four sexually active wives, that's a lot of
work.''
 &HT;    With its reputation for divinely sanctioned promiscuity, the
Hildale and Colorado City community attracts its share of misguided
visitors, says Dan Barlow, who is the town's mayor and an elder in
the church that owns nearly every house here.
 &HT;    ``They think what goes on here is all about sex,'' he says.
``It's foolish to make such a claim because we live a hundred miles
or so from Las Vegas. If people want sex, that's where they should
go.''
 &HT;    The mayor took me on a tour. The houses he showed me were huge,
some with as many as 15 to 20 bedrooms and others that looked more
like half-finished motels or dormitories. On a weekday afternoon,
every female in town was wearing an ankle-length dress.
 &HT;    ``These are happy, joyous homes,'' Barlow said. With its
extraordinary rate of reproduction, the community is growing by
better than 10 percent a year, he said.
 &HT;    As for the allegations that boys paw at their sisters and old
men prey on young girls, he shakes his head. ``Whenever you have
people living together, you're going to have people problems, the
same here as anywhere else.''
 &HT;    Prompted by the recent furor, two bills introduced in the
current state legislative session directly target polygamy. One
would raise the legal age of marriage from 14 to 16. The other
would provide money and shelters for women who want to flee but may
not meet the specific admittance rules of traditional halfway
homes.
 &HT;    ``What these women have brought into broad daylight is a civil
rights issue that is second to none in the history of Utah,'' says
State Sen. Scott Howell, the leader of the Democratic legislative
minority in Utah, who introduced one of the bills.
 &HT;    ``Here, we've got all the world coming to town for the Olympics.
Do we really want to be known as the place where we let old men
marry little girls?''
 &HT;    For the women who brought polygamy out of Utah's closet, the
2002 Olympics remain the trump card. More than 10,000 visiting
journalists will be deluged with information about the world's
greatest snow, the glowing city in the Wasatch, the spotless
facilities.
 &HT;    And then, when they grow tired of the luge and the Tabernacle
Choir stories, the press will have no trouble finding the women of
Tapestry, who will tell them about Utah's other heritage.

CITY OFFICIALS SAY SAN FRANCISCO SURPLUS SHRINKING FAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The city budget faces a $57 million deficit in
three years if the rate of spending remains the same and revenue
slows, San Francisco's senior financial wizards say.
</P>
<P>
   That would represent a stark turnaround in City Hall's recent
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate was released Wednesday in a joint report by
Controller Ed Harrington, Board of Supervisors Budget Analyst
Harvey Rose and Matthew Hymel, the mayor's budget director.
</P>
<P>
   They were quick to point out that budget projections are based
on today's understanding of the city's budget picture, taking into
account everything from inflation to pay raises for public
employees.
</P>
<P>
   However, Harrington and Hymel said they were optimistic that the
tax base would continue to grow, averting deficits that were
routine just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The projection, they said, should be used as nothing more than a
signal that close vigilance over the budget is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Finance Committee should use a lot of caution in
their budget considerations this year,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of living high on the hog are over,'' said Leland
Yee, chairman of the Board of Supervisors' Finance Committee. ``Now
we have to start tackling the structural problems of the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   He vowed that there would be no automatic midyear bailouts when
departments run out of money and that workers' compensation claims
would be monitored. Some 6,000 of San Francisco's 27,000 city
employees file for workers' compensation each year, accounting for
one of the city's most nagging and costly budget problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to continue this lifestyle, we are going to be
in deficit mode,'' Yee said.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's last fiscal year ended in June with a $145
million surplus _ the largest this decade. But a combination of
runaway workers' compensation costs, unanticipated overtime,
higher-than-expected expenses to run the two public hospitals and a
bailout for the municipal transit system have been eating into the
money pot.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the 1,800 new employees in the four years since
Mayor Willie Brown has been in office and a steady stream of pay
raises, and balancing the almost $4 billion budget becomes more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said that by the start of the next fiscal year, on
July 1, the surplus will shrink to $1.5 million. He said even that
is a comfortable cushion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In summary, the city is in good shape,'' Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when the economy was flat, deficits were
routinely $100 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   By law, San Francisco must start each new fiscal year with a
balanced budget, so any deficits must be erased by service cuts,
dismissals or increases in taxes and fees, prospects that make
politicians flinch.

THIS WEEK'S TV HIGHLIGHTS

   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about your hardy perennials. After nearly 100 years ``The
Scarlet Pimpernel'' remains a tingling adventure yarn. A string of
novels and stories by Baroness Emmuska Orczy that began in 1900
have spawned at least seven movies, countless spoofs and several
stage adaptations, including the current Broadway musical.
</P>
<P>
   Betting that there's still some swash in the old boy's buckle,
A&AMP;E is offering three new ``Pimpernel'' films. Judging by the first
of these, to be seen on Sunday night, the bet has paid delightful
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1793, and the French are revolting. Things are getting out
of hand; those who toppled the king are proving to be tyrants
themselves. Heads are rolling. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one ray of hope: a small, mysterious band has been
rescuing some innocent prisoners from the clutches of Robespierre's
henchmen and spiriting them to safety in England. The band's
fearless leader (OK, (italics)you(end italics) try telling this
story without cliches) is known by his nom de guerre, the Scarlet
Pimpernel. Who is he?
</P>
<P>
   He is Sir Percy Blakeney, a foppish Englishman, the witty life
of any party, whose dalliances _ fencing, hunting, racing his yacht
_ are the perfect cover for his secret identity. This playboy is
the original Batman, the proto-Green Hornet.
</P>
<P>
   And the current adapters, led by the director Patrick Lau and
the writer Richard Carpenter, retell his tale with tongue firmly in
cheek, toying merrily with this costume-draped fable without ever
letting it descend into camp.
</P>
<P>
   Two of this romp's strongest assets are Richard E. Grant as
Percy and Martin Shaw as his evil nemesis, Chauvelin, once the
lover of Lady Blakeney, nee Marguerite Sainte-Just, back in the
days when she was a Parisian music-hall chanteuse.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chauvelin is a dogged pursuer of those deemed enemies of the
French Revolution, with the Pimpernel at the top of his list.
</P>
<P>
   When the two first meet at a London party for the Prince of
Wales, Percy is deep into his silly-weakling act, which has even
fooled Marguerite (Elizabeth McGovern). Challenged to a duel, he
parries with bons mots, saying he won't fight because ``it's bad
for the digestion, and it ruins one's clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the two-hour film _ a satisfying resolution that
still leaves room for adventures to come _ the two antagonists are
snorting fire at each other. Their performances honor the memory of
Leslie Howard and Raymond Massey, who played these roles in 1934,
while adding just the right dash of 1990s irony.
</P>
<P>
   As the third member of the story's central triangle, however,
Ms. McGovern looks as if she isn't having any fun. As the story
progresses, Marguerite must radically change her opinion of her
husband as she understands his true courage and must display a
barrelful of courage herself.
</P>
<P>
   But even while declaiming lines like ``Love is stronger than
hate,'' Ms. McGovern seems ever passive and a bit dazed. (You may
be a bit dazed, too, if you try too hard to follow the convoluted
plot, filled with intrigues and betrayals. Don't sweat the small
stuff.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGovern is an American playing a Frenchwoman. But as
everybody does in this film (a co-production with the BBC) she
speaks with a British accent. It would have helped the American
viewer if there were some aural clues to keep the fictional French
and Brits sorted out.
</P>
<P>
   But if the ear is a bit confused, the eye is well served. The
French Republic, as recreated in the Czech Republic, is a dark and
smoky but endlessly fascinating place. Many scenes are packed with
details, like the children playing with their imaginary, improvised
guillotine on a Paris street.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the supporting cast members are worth attention,
among them Ron Donachie as Percy's French friend Mazzarini, a
forger who can duplicate paintings and documents. ``I haven't an
original brush stroke in my body,'' he proclaims proudly.
</P>
<P>
   There may be no more originality in this film than in one of
Mazzarini's masterpieces. But this is no forgery. It's genuine
silly fun. &QL;

<P>
   CBS, Sunday and Tuesday night at 9 &QL;

<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The story (italics)about(end italics) the novel ``The Earth
Abideth'' may be more fascinating than anything (italics)in(end
italics) it. The plot, beginning in the 1860s, spans 50 years in
the life of an Ohio farm family. It was written in 1938 but not
published until 1986, when the author, George Dell, was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Now, alas, the story has been slapped with a one-size-fits-all
title, ``Seasons of Love,'' and turned into a generic mini-series
that's as distinctive as a can of store-brand no-frills green peas.
</P>
<P>
   When first seen, Thomas Linthorne (Peter Strauss) is a traveling
seed salesman. He will spend the rest of his life reaping what he
sows. The moment he sees Kate (Rachel Ward), he knows he's found
his life's companion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't lookin' for a workhorse,'' he says. ``Don't you worry
about me workin','' she replies. They talk like that to each other
for four hours, while they endure trials, tribulations and
children. Then they die.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss and Ms. Ward, mini-series mainstays, conserve their
acting energy over the long haul, letting a brave smile or mopey
pout define the husband and wife. This is more like reciting than
acting. At one pivotal moment Thomas explains, ``My heart is
broken.''
</P>
<P>
   The supporting cast includes Rip Torn, who looks uncomfortable,
and Hume Cronyn, who proves that it is possible to create a
three-dimensional three-minute character. Three cheers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Thomas says, ``There don't seem to be no rhyme or
reason how things turned out,'' you'll have to agree. Unless you
have a heart of iron, you'll be moved by the story's conclusion.
But unless you have a constitution of steel, you won't get that
far. &QL;

   CHENOWETH-THEATER (New York) _ In a Broadway season packed with
Electra, the Lomans and other gloomy characters, the true master of
existential angst just may be a 5-year-old cartoon malcontent by
the name of Sally Brown. ``I was jumping rope, everything seemed
fine,'' says Sally, in a martini-dry deadpan. ``And suddenly, it
all seemed so futile.'' The actress responsible for Sally's
delectable depression is Kristen Chenoweth, a diminutive
28-year-old who has been receiving some of the season's best
reviews as Charlie Brown's kid sister in the revival of ``You're a
Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' playing at the Ambassador Theater. By
Jesse McKinley.

<P>
   It's not all kuchen and kitsch in Fredericksburg anymore.
</P>
<P>
   A serious tourist trade also means some serious restaurants.
Although we love brats and beer, it's terrific to have the option
of something a little less, well, Germanic. Here are some newish
offerings in the heart of the Hill Country.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln St.: Start out the evening in this meandering
wine-cheese-olive emporium. Order a plate of cheese for two of
manchego, white Cheddar, bel paese or fontina, take a pick of your
favorite plonk and sit down to watch a collection of locals from
cattlemen to lawyers wander in to say howdy. It's very civilized
without being pretentious.
</P>
<P>
   111 S. Lincoln St., (830) 997-8463. Open 10 a.m.-9 p.m.
Tuesday-Thursday; 10 a.m.-11 p.m. Friday-Saturday; 1-9 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Navajo Grill: This very modern restaurant is tucked in among the
gift shops on Fredericksburg's main drag. Desert tones on the tiled
floors take diners far away from cuckoo clocks and Hummels.
</P>
<P>
   The Banderas pork chop ($17.95) is a mountainous double-cut chop
served with roasted-garlic mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables.
(We had been tipped to the restaurant's wonderful fried spinach _
spinach deep-fried until it is just an ethereal mouthful _ and the
waiter nicely made the substitution.) Just as heavenly is the Black
Angus rib-eye ($20.95) served with creole garlic cream potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   As we were leaving, we complimented the chef through the serving
window from the kitchen. The pork, we said, was fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, thanks,'' he replied, ``the trick is to turn it on its
side with the bone touching the grill for the last few minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   A terrific meal and a cooking tip to go.
</P>
<P>
   209 E. Main St., (830) 990-8289. Open 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m.
Tuesday-Saturday; 6-9 p.m. Tuesday-Thursday; 6-10 p.m.
Friday-Saturday. Reservations recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Cuisine: Marie-Claire Quittelier is a bundle of energy.
She made her name in Fredericksburg with the eponymous
MarieCuisine, a tiny house where she served breakfast and lunch,
the occasional dinner (locals knew to call to find out if dinner
was on), taught cooking classes and catered special events.
</P>
<P>
   Lunches tend to be on the light side. Our favorites here include
a tomato soup with madeira (customers call in advance to find out
if it's the day's soup) and the chocolate mousse, a
too-often-forgotten classic.
</P>
<P>
   As high season approaches, Marie-Claire is readying a bistro on
Main Street that will handle the breakfast and lunch trade. The
original Marie Cuisine will then serve only dinner.
</P>
<P>
   202 E. Schubert, (830) 990-0498, call for hours. The Bistro in
the Courtyard of the Nimitz Birthplace (249 E. Main St.) will open
in March to serve breakfast and lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The Nest: John and Monica Wilkinson took a round-about route to
the Hill Country. Originally from San Antonio, they moved to Aspen,
where John was chef at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. Now back in Texas,
they're doing a bang-up job with The Nest.
</P>
<P>
   The aptly named restaurant is a cozy little refitted house with
service Fort Worth could aspire to. The menu is a mix of native
ingredients with classic treatments. A velvety fillet of beef is
paired with bordelaise sauce for $21. A rack of to-die-for lamb is
served with a stone-ground mustard demi-glace and turnip mashed
potatoes (they do love their potatoes in Fredericksburg) for $23.
On the lighter (and less expensive side of the menu) are pasta with
tomato sauce, kalamata olives, capers and asiago cheese for $9, and
a roasted half-chicken with portobello mushroom sauce for $15.
</P>
<P>
   607 S. Washington, (830) 990-8383. Open 5-9 p.m. Thursday and
Sunday-Monday; 5-10 p.m. Friday-Saturday. Reservations recommended.

`DIRTY DANCING' STAR GOT A NOSE JOB TO BOOST HER CAREER _ BUT IT
BACKFIRED
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by GREY-COSMETIC SURGERY and GREY-FLAWED FACES) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two things used to be off-limits in a Jennifer Grey interview.
</P>
<P>
   Her nose job and her love life.
</P>
<P>
   Now both are fair game.
</P>
<P>
   In ``It's like, you know,'' the promising midseason comedy
premiering March 24 on ABC, Jennifer Grey portrays Jennifer Grey, a
struggling actress who unwittingly created her own anonymity with a
less-than-flattering nose job.
</P>
<P>
   The running gag of the series, created by former ``Seinfeld''
writer and producer Peter Mehlman, is that Grey's appearance has
been so joltingly modified that even the most passionate ``Dirty
Dancing'' followers aren't sure it's her. Jennifer Grey has to
convince people she's actually Jennifer Grey.
</P>
<P>
   If the actress is still pained by this unfortunate career fluke,
she's not letting on. What's certain is that she has received so
much flak about her nose, from stunned casting directors passing
her over to moviegoers squinting to recognize her, that mocking her
own misfortune couldn't damage a career defined by theatrical flops
and featherweight made-for-TV movies.
</P>
<P>
   For Grey, 39, this might be her last-ditch effort for stardom.
She admits now that she panicked when scripts didn't come her way
after the 1987 sleeper hit ``Dirty Dancing'' grossed more than $300
million worldwide and made a sensual star of co-lead Patrick
Swayze.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the scapegoat was the nose.
</P>
<P>
   On hiatus from the film ``Wind'' in 1992, she returned with the
new look, stunning her co-workers, none of whom thought she needed
it. Her old pudgy nose (which had gotten her the ``Dirty Dancing''
lead, after all) was now slimmer, leaner, sleeker, longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was strictly so I could get jobs,'' Grey says. ``The intent
was to look exactly the same. Just photographed a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, cosmetic surgery is like white noise _ omnipresent
and virtually unnoticed. Not getting some kind of facial or body
lift is more the exception in a business that's fueled by the
exterior.
</P>
<P>
   But few have gone through the public ridicule experienced by
Grey, whose shapely almond eyes complemented her wider nose in
pre-surgery days. Now it simply looks like something is missing
from her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go under the knife, you're taking an enormous risk,''
says Ted Harbert, a former chairman of ABC Entertainment and a
co-executive producer of ``It's like, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early episodes of ``It's like, you know,'' which will air
at 7:30 p.m. CST Wednesdays, Grey's revelations represent some of
the funnier threads weaving through this series, a kind of ``L.A.
Story'' wheeled around a sitcom formula. It focuses on a New York
writer's (Chris Eigeman as Arthur) cynical pretenses about Los
Angeles. Like, you know, how the city comes to a halt during
highway car chases.
</P>
<P>
   Grey is the neighbor of Arthur's friend (Robbie, played by
Steven Eckholdt), and she bounces in and out, sharing anecdotes
about horrible auditions and clashes with fans who think she's
Jennifer Grey but aren't sure. (In one scene, she's ecstatic when
someone actually recognizes her.)
</P>
<P>
   Just as revealing is her other continuing story line _ that men
seem to become famous after she dates them.
</P>
<P>
   Grey has rarely wanted for romantic attention (another sign that
The Nose wasn't much of a hindrance). She was engaged to Johnny
Depp for nine months in 1990 and has been romantically linked to
Tom Cruise, Liam Neeson and Matthew Broderick. (Post-surgery dates
included former Clinton staffer George Stephanopoulos.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have very good taste in men,'' Grey explains.
``Honestly, guys becoming famous after they date me is a joke in my
life. So I thought, let's make this someone who can't get ahead
herself but everyone she kisses or dates or goes out with, even a
little, gets what she wants. So it's a lot of, `what, him, too?'''
</P>
<P>
   Grey tells Mehlman so much about her life that she has to
preface chats with ``but this can't be in the show'' just so he'll
know what's for the art and what's a private conversation. And in
an interview, sharing only goes so far; Grey won't talk about how
her show-biz family feels about her change in face or a role
basically poking fun at her life. She's the granddaughter of
comedian Mickey Katz; her mother is former Broadway actress Jo
Silver, her father is Broadway star Joel Grey.
</P>
<P>
   She spent most of her childhood shuttling between Manhattan and
LA, all the while dreaming of being an actress, a profession
forbidden by her father until she was old enough to leave home. He
felt she needed more maturity to deal with the hardships of acting,
and now she gets his drift.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there's the way she felt after learning that the
``Dirty Dancing'' role was won because she wasn't considered ``an
obvious beauty.'' This feeling of inadequacy was renewed during the
movie's 10-year anniversary when producer Linda Gottlieb told
``Entertainment Tonight'' that she saw Grey in the same vein as
Barbra Streisand in ``The Way We Were,'' another fantasy in which
the average girl gets the gorgeous guy.
</P>
<P>
   Now Grey talks about her experiences in a Zen-like way, speaking
of things like destiny, and saying that without having had things
happen ``exactly'' as they did, she would have never gotten the
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have never figured out who I was without celebrity,''
she says. Nor would she have been handed a gift many famous people
crave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to be in the world with normal people again after that
was taken away by being recognizable,'' Grey says. ``I had to
completely rebuild who I thought I was without anyone's input. And
I think that's the most valuable thing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's another oddity. If ``It's like, you know'' becomes a hit,
Grey could lose what she gained, falling back into the unrealistic
world her series character mocks.
</P>
<P>
   Grey is Zen-like again. ``I'll deal with what comes,'' she says.
``And even if (the series) doesn't work, I'll deal with that also.
There is no way of anticipating or controlling any of it. We're all
so powerless. We can only do the best we can. The results are out
of our hands.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jennifer Grey isn't the only star who has cut off her nose to
spite her face _ or reshaped some other part of the anatomy. Here
are our nominations for the Cosmetic Surgery Hall of Fame. (Kudos
to the Plastic People Page,
www.geocities.com/Hollywood/7990/plastic.html).
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL JACKSON: Having seen his face on TV since he first
upstaged his brothers at age 10, Jackson must've become bored. How
else to explain the way the attractive young African-American on
the cover of 1979's Off the Wall evolved into the angular, oddly
pigmented eccentric who's really off the wall?
</P>
<P>
   ROSEANNE: According to the Plastic People Page, Roseanne has had
work on both face and body. If only there were cosmetic surgery
that could alter unpleasantly caustic personalities.
</P>
<P>
   CHER: On their TV show, Sonny Bono constantly ribbed his
then-wife about her big nose. So she changed it _ and just about
everything else.
</P>
<P>
   DEMI MOORE: Moore has claimed that she hasn't had her breasts
done. Rent ``Blame It on Rio'' and ``Striptease,'' then you decide.
On second thought, rent ``About Last Night'' ... and ``A Few Good
Men''; the first two movies are too high a price to pay for
curiosity about someone's body.
</P>
<P>
   PHYLLIS DILLER: Unlike some other stars, Diller has been open
about her surgery, but it's a little pointless, like restoring one
of those Gremlin cars from the '70s.

(EDS: Accompanies TV-JENNIFER GREY) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's probable that every star in Hollywood over the age of 30 _
and many under _ has had some sort of cosmetic surgery. But a few
wear their most prominent flaws as badges of honor. We salute them,
because flawed beauty is more interesting than perfect beauty.
</P>
<P>
   BARBRA STREISAND: Streisand's strikingly large nose _ not to
mention her too-wide lips _ wonderfully offsets her huge, warm blue
eyes, making her the poster child for not messing too much with
your face.
</P>
<P>
   DUSTIN HOFFMAN: Because of his honker, Hoffman has played
oddball character roles much more often than he has played romantic
leads. Not coincidentally, he has also become one of Hollywood's
most interesting actors.
</P>
<P>
   ELLEN BARKIN: We're not sure how to put this delicately, so we
won't: Barkin looks like she's been hit in the face with a frying
pan. But her attitude can be so unbelievable sexy _ watch her back
Al Pacino against a door in ``Sea of Love'' _ that we're infatuated
with her, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   CLINT EASTWOOD: With every new movie, Clint's face looks more
and more like the rugged landscapes of his spaghetti westerns, but
he has taken advantage of the crags in his aging tough-guy roles.
</P>
<P>
   CAMRYN MANHEIM: The Emmy-winning star of TV's ``The Practice''
has proved that you don't have to be slim to be beautiful.

IT'S SPRING, AND THAT MEANS IT'S TIME TO CATCH THE WIND (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kite-flying season is almost here. As far as you're concerned.
</P>
<P>
   For some _ namely members of the American Kitefliers Association
and its Dallas-Fort Worth chapter, Jewels of the Sky, or JOTS _
it's always the right time for flying kites.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need is a steady wind with no turbulence, preferably
12 to 15 miles per hour,'' says Larry Whitacre, JOTS vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but most people wouldn't be willing to endure Mother
Nature's other elements _ precipitation and cold weather, for
example _ in order to get that thrill of getting a kite off the
ground and keeping it afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Well, even JOTS folk don't fly in the driving rain, but they do
have the patience to wait it out. Or, they turn to one of the
newest trends in kite flying: indoor kites.
</P>
<P>
   Flying kites indoors is not ideal, though, considering that they
are ultralight and can only fly a few score feet overhead, with the
operator's walking movements rather than the wind as the
centrifugal force.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us on a more basic kite-flying level, spring is an
ideal time of the year to fly a kite.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the AKA and the Kite Trade Association International
are heading an effort to officially designate April as National
Kite Month. Trial events _ including community flies, education and
youth involvement _ will premiere this year, with a bigger,
millennial push for nationwide awareness in April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Kite flying is a great family activity, but if you attend JOTS
functions _ which happen each weekend and rotate between parks in
Fort Worth, Richardson and Lewisville _ it's the older kids, the
30-plus-somethings, you'll see constantly constructing, comparing
notes, measuring the wind. You know, having ``fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Nixie, former JOTS president, has been fascinated with
kites most of her life. ``It's playing with the wind,'' she says.
``You're playing with something you can't see. I like everything
having to do with nature, storms and all that.''
</P>
<P>
   When the big kids play, kite flying becomes a sport that
requires as many safety rules as a full-contact sport. Kite
etiquette _ knowing how much distance to give between oneself and
other fliers, watching out for grounded kite lines _ is mandatory.
After all, some of these kites can cost hundreds of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This is where education comes in. Nixie often holds workshops
and teaches in the schools about kiting safety and how to construct
a basic kite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually start with a sled kite, made from an 11-by-17-inch
sheet of copier paper, a paper streamer tail and rods of plastic
drinking straws,'' she says. ``It's a tiger-face design, so I have
them draw on eyes, mouth and the tiger stripes.''

   The Kite Stuff: What puts the wind beneath their wings? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are many types of kites and materials used to make them.
And kite-making technology continues to grow, with new, lighter
materials and methods being introduced on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is not any one type of kite that is preferred by
professional fliers, there is a new fad going on with buggies _
small, three-wheeled carts on which the operator sits and is pulled
by a large, sturdy, multi-lined kite. This obviously takes a high
wind velocity, 20 miles per hour or more.
</P>
<P>
   Another kite of interest is the Indian fighting kite. A small,
diamond-shaped kite, it is swift and ferocious. This kite
originated on the Indian subcontinent, where the operators lace
their strings with broken glass and try to cut the opponents' kites
out of the sky. In America, this practice is a little less vicious
and has stricter regulations. But the main object _ to make the
other guy's kite crash _ is still the same.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Let's go buy a kite
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are no specialty kite shops in the Metroplex.
If you want something more than the typical kite found at Wal-Mart
or Kmart, you'll have to order from catalogs, most of which are
available on the Internet. Be prepared to fork over a little more
money than expected.
</P>
<P>
   A few sites include:
</P>
<P>
   Into the Wind: One of the leading companies for research and
kite development, the online store offers windsocks, kites and
other flying toys from all over the world: www.intothewind.com.
</P>
<P>
   BFK: The world's largest online kite store has anything and
everything you'll need to know: www.kitestore.com/kite/index

products and much more: www.air-fun.com

GOP CHAIRMAN TAKES AIM AT GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican Party Chairman Jim Nicholson fired an
early salvo Thursday in the 2000 presidential campaign, calling the
Democratic frontrunner, Vice President Al Gore, a ``reckless
environmental extremist.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson cited Gore's support for an international treaty to
control so-called ``greenhouse'' gas emissions, which many
scientists say is a prime cause of gradual global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide efforts to control such emissions will lead to high
energy costs and unemployment in the United States ``while giving
key advantages to nations such as China,'' Nicholson told
reporters. Administration support of emission reductions ``will
surely cause middle-class families to shiver in the winter time.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the treaty negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997,
the world's leading industrial nations agreed to cut industrial
emissions from the burning of coal, oil, wood and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   The pact obligates the United States over the next 10 to 15
years to cut such emissions by about 7 percent from its 1990 level.
Critics of the treaty, many of them representing key U.S.
industries, say it is not as harsh on developing Third-World
countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and would give them a
competitive advantage in global markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration signed the accord late last year but
won't forward it to the GOP-controlled Senate for ratification
until it wins concessions from other countries that would enable
U.S. industries to hold down the cost of compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the administration's leading spokesman on environmental
issues, praised the treaty last year, saying it ``underscores our
determination to achieve a truly global solution to this global
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson charged Thursday that Gore likes ``to pose as kind of
a boring but essentially sober policy wonk. He's nothing of the
sort. He's a reckless environmental extremist.''
</P>
<P>
   In attacking Gore, the GOP chairman offered a preview of the
Republican strategy against the presumptive Democratic candidate.
Republican contenders Patrick Buchanan, Steve Forbes and Lamar
Alexander have taken shots at the vice president on a variety of
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, spokesman for Gore, dismissed Nicholson's attack
as the cry of a ``party without ideas, devoid of message and
lacking vision. They focus on past and we look to future.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said that six years of Democratic control of the White
House ``have proven you can balance the environment and the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said Gore also is vulnerable for his defense of
President Clinton throughout the impeachment effort.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``is probably the only politician in America who has not
criticized President Clinton for being dishonest with the American
people,'' Nicholson said. ``I think that's going to hurt him in the
election in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Republicans might pay a price for pushing
impeachment when polls showed most Americans wanted Clinton to
remain in office, Nicholson replied, ``Republicans stood up for
principles and not polls and did what they thought was the right
thing to do. This election will be determined by the issues and the
agenda and the vision and the values we communicate to the American
people about their future.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are focusing on lower taxes, saving Social Security,
beefing up the military and greater local control of education
dollars flowing out of Washington, he said.

SEATTLE LOOKS AT IRISH FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the '90s, Ireland has experienced its biggest boom ever in
domestic film production. Just last week, actor Aidan Quinn called
it an ``explosion'' and the ``prying off of the cement lid of
oppression in Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the higher-profile films of this ``explosion'' _ such as
John Boorman's ``The General'' and Neil Jordan's ``The Butcher
Boy'' _ have, of course, been internationally financed and
distributed. But most of its smaller-budget, independent films have
never reached these shores.
</P>
<P>
   So an Irish Film Festival seems a particularly good idea at this
time. And Seattle is lucky to have ``Irish Reels: The Second Annual
Irish Film and Video Festival,'' which kicks off Friday night in
the luxurious confines of General Cinema's new Pacific Place
Cinema. It continues through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The festivities begin at 6 p.m. with a reception, followed by a
15-minute short, ``Freesia of Eden,'' at 6:45 p.m., and the
90-minute opening-night feature, ``2x4,'' directed by and starring
Jimmy Smallhorne, at 7:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Described as a ``raw, visceral portrait of the Irish immigrant
experience,'' ``2x4'' follows a crew of Irishmen who work on
construction sites in Manhattan by day and party into the night at
their Bronx pub hangout ``facing conflicts with each other and with
New York itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival continues Saturday with a showing of ``Best of the
Northern Ireland Film Commission Shorts, Part 1,'' at 3 p.m.;
``Southpaw,'' a feature documentary about a poor Irish boy who
becomes an Olympic boxer, at 6 p.m.; and ``Ailsa,'' a new film by
Paddy Breathnach, the director of ``I Went Down,'' at 7:45.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the offerings will be a selection of Irish shorts at
3 p.m.; ``Just in Time,'' a 52-minute domestic drama directed by
John Carney and Tom Collins, at 6 p.m.; and ``The Bogwoman,'' an
84-minute tragicomedy about three women living in the Derry Bogside
in the '60s, at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the festival moves to 911 Media Arts Center (117 Yale
Ave. N.) for ``Best of Northern Ireland Film Commission Shorts,
Part 2,'' at 7 p.m.; and ``Irish Cinema: Ourselves Alone,'' a
52-minute documentary about ``the past 100 years of filmmaking in
Ireland,'' at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, also at 911 Media Arts Center, the festival
concludes with ``My Great Grandmother Was a Boxer,'' a 50-minute
video documentary about a woman's look into her family's past, at 7
p.m.; and ``The Three Brothers,'' a 51-minute video documentary
about the making of ``This Is My Father,'' a film by Quinn and his
two brothers that premiered at the last Seattle International Film
Festival. It shows at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A closing-night party sponsored by Guinness will follow the
final screening. Ticket prices are $7 ($5 for 911 members) for each
evening screening; $5 ($3) for matinees; $10 ($8) for opening
night; and $40 ($35) for a series pass.

TECHNOLOGY FIRMS LOBBY FOR PERMANENT EXTENSION OF R&AMP;D TAX CREDIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hi-tech company officials are lobbying hard for a
permanent extension of the research and development tax credit,
hopeful that the budget surplus and talk of tax cuts in Congress
will boost its chances this year.
</P>
<P>
   The tax credit, which is usually renewed for one year, provides
up to a 20 percent credit for R&AMP;D investments that are beyond what
corporations have traditionally spent. The tax credit pays
primarily for wages of researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The credit, due to expire June 30, has been renewed temporarily
since 1981. Technology companies say they need the permanent
extension so they can plan long-term projects. Supporters say such
an extension would create and sustain high-skill jobs for American
workers, increase domestic exports and fuel a strong U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Graves, director of tax policy for the American
Electronics Association, which represents 3,000 high-tech firms,
said the extension is the top tax priority this year for the
association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need an incentive in the tax code to help our businesses do
the research they need to do,'' Graves said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies use the tax credit for research on a wide
range of projects such as a new drug, a faster disk drive or a
system to make the Internet run faster.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sample, chairman of the R&AMP;D Credit Coalition, which
represents more than 50 trade associations and 1,000 companies
working to make the tax credit permanent, said that ``for many
companies, it provides an additional source of funds to do extra
research they wouldn't otherwise be able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sample said research projects often last up to 10 years and that
companies need to budget for them years in advance.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 50 technology companies _ including aerospace,
telephone, biotech, software and pharmaceutical firms _ are
boosting their lobbying effort on Capitol Hill, he said. He added
that he is optimistic that the credit may become permanent or at
least extended for a longer period this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that with the surplus and the general upbeat economic
forecast there is a greater chance that Congress would be willing
to extend it for a longer period,'' said Sample, a senior tax
director at Microsoft Corp. in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been reluctant to approve a long-term extension of
the credit largely because it costs the federal government about $2
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Reps. Jennifer Dunn of Washington and Jerry Weller of
Illinois, both members of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee,
have drafted a broad five-year $340 billion tax cut bill that
includes a permanent extension of the R&AMP;D tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Reps. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., and Bob Matsui,
D-Calif., also Ways and Means panel members, introduced a narrower
measure that also would extend the credit permanently.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, and Max Baucus, D-Mont.,
have drafted a bipartisan counterpart to the Johnson-Matsui bill,
also calling for permanent extension. The Hatch-Baucus bill has at
least 24 co-sponsors.

TANGO OFFERS GREAT MOMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's always been a terrific chemistry between the tango and
the movies. Even before film could talk, one of its signature
sequences was Rudolph Valentino tangoing his way into immortality
as the hero of 1921's ``The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of Al Pacino and Gabrielle Anwar in ``Scent of a Woman.''
Think of Jack Lemmon and Joe E. Brown in ``Some Like It Hot.''
Catherine Deneuve and Linh Dan Pham in ``Indochine.'' Is there any
ballroom dance quite so sensuous, so visually seductive?
</P>
<P>
   The new Spanish-Argentine dance movie, ``Tango,'' is crammed
full of great tango moments: in fact, it's the movies' greatest
celebration of tango since Raul Julia's ``Tango Bar'' (a 1988 movie
memorable for its vintage clips of everyone from Fred Astaire to
Fred Flintsone doing the tango).
</P>
<P>
   With its best foreign film Oscar nomination and
behind-the-camera dream-team _ Spain's master director Carlos
Saura, Italy's legendary cinematographer Vittorio Storaro and
Argentine-born Hollywood composer Lalo Schrifin _ it's also likely
to be the tango movie to beat for a good long time.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the film is a tango version of Bob Fosse's ``All That
Jazz,'' the story of a Buenos Aires director (Miguel Angel Sola) in
the midst of making ``the ultimate film about tango,'' which he
hopes will both evoke the great Argentine tango films of the '40s
and surpass them.
</P>
<P>
   We follow him as he casts and rehearses his dancers, works with
his choreographers and art directors and haggles with his
financiers _ all while struggling with the personal handicap of a
broken leg from a recent auto accident and the emotional
devastation of having just been left by his tango-dancer wife
(Cecilia Narova).
</P>
<P>
   And we get inside his creative process as tries to work out his
complex artistic concepts for the film, and inside his sexual
fantasies as he falls in love with one of his beautiful young
ingenue dancers (Mia Maestro), who just happens to be the live-in
lover of the film's chief financial backer: a particularly violent
gangster.
</P>
<P>
   The director sees everything in terms of tango. It's his way of
looking at the world and his vehicle for expressing love, hate,
passion, melancholy, the agony of the aging process. So everything
that happens to him both internally and externally is an excuse for
the screen to break into stylized fury of dance.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it seems a bit too much of a good thing. In the
show-within-a-show's epic finale, a tango-version of Argentina's
recent sad political past _ complete with government executions and
mass graves _ I found myself sympathizing with the director's
backers who beg him to cut the scene because ``it's too much.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is a small caveat. ``Tango'' has zip, color,
captivating music, striking camera work, mesmerizing dancers. It's
a grand opera of tango: a film that tries to sum up the human
condition in terms of history's sexiest, most passionate dance. It
can't possibly succeed in such an ambitious undertaking, but it's a
movie that's still very hard to resist.

WEB SITE FOR FINDING AND SHIPPING WINE IS PLANNED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ A San Francisco company with powerful
financial backing and support from the biggest foe of direct wine
shipping plans this year to unveil a multibillion-dollar national
wine-locator system and wine-shipping Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Naxon Corp. is working in cooperation with the Wine and Spirits
Wholesalers Association and is backed by the investment group that
helped fund AOL, Netscape and Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some winery organizations expressed skepticism that Naxon
could overcome the logistical and regulatory obstacles that
hindered similar projects in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Naxon Corp. officials said the system would allow consumers to
locate and purchase wines online and have the wines delivered
legally to their homes or a local retailer. No name has been set
for the Internet site, nor a date when it will go live, company
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system, wine orders would be filled using an
established network of wholesalers and retailers through Virtual
Distribution Inc., a Naxon-owned company that is already licensed
in 37 states.
</P>
<P>
   Naxon got support for the service from one of the strongest
opponents of direct wine sales _ the national wholesalers
association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary role in partnering with Naxon is to provide the
inventory database of brands available from wholesalers,'' said
David Dickerson, vice president of public affairs for WSWA, the
national wholesalers' organization.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson said that Naxon approached WSWA for its support at a
time when WSWA was trying to come up with its own locator service
for consumers. ``They recognized first off that there has to be a
commitment to provide legal fulfillment to shipping wines, to make
sure that only adults can buy the wine, and that they have to
fulfill tax obligations with the states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   WSWA has long opposed direct sales of wine via the Internet or
toll-free telephone numbers, squaring off against some wineries and
winery organizations that want to change laws in states to permit
direct sales. Currently a handful of states allow some form of
direct sales, but in the last two years Georgia, Florida and
Kentucky have made direct shipment of wine a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Some winery organizations are taking a cautious stance toward
the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We applaud efforts to improve wine access for adult wine
lovers,'' said Jeremy Benson, executive director of Free the
Grapes!, a coalition of wineries, retailers and consumers that
wants to ensure consumer access to fine wine. Benson said his
organization was concerned that ``the same hurdles that currently
block consumer access to direct shipping in many states, and the
harsh restrictions wineries encounter in conducting interstate
trade, may hinder the development of Naxon's concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems, Benson pointed out, was that most states
require brand and label registration before a wine can be sold.
Those costs _ up to $500 per label _ and the time involved _ up to
90 days _ may be impractical for one-time shipments, he said.
Benson also noted hurdles involving varying franchise laws and laws
in states where the government is both wholesaler and retailer.
</P>
<P>
   A backer of the project is the venture capital firm Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, which financed companies like AOL,
Compaq, Netscape, drugstore.com and realtor.com.

SOUTHERN ROCK VETERANS BAND TOGETHER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Fla.)   By TERRY PACE   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUSCLE SHOALS, Ala. _ Two decades after the musical explosion
known as Southern rock, four prime movers and shakers of that
free-spirited, '70s-centered cultural phenomenon are back on the
road and back in the studio.
</P>
<P>
   Billed the Southern Rock All-Stars, the band's lineup features
representatives of such hard-driving Southern-rock acts as
Blackfoot, Molly Hatchet and the Rossington Band. Twenty-five years
ago, those bands along with such kindred spirits as Lynyrd Skynyrd
and the Allman Brothers brewed their own rambunctious,
guitar-seasoned brand of blues, boogie and heavy metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those days were great, but this time it's for us,'' said
All-Stars vocalist, lead and slide guitarist Dave Hlubek, one of
the founding members of Molly Hatchet. ``Back then, I wasn't
prepared for the success at all _ I had no idea what kind of a
rocket ride it would be. This time we're doing it for fun, and it's
never felt better.''
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the All-Stars are Jakson Spires, Blackfoot
founder on drums and vocals; Jay Johnson, a veteran of Rossington
Band on lead guitar and vocals, and Pete Geddes, an alumnus of the
Lester Chambers Group and Buster Cherry Band on bass and vocals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we're doing this because we got tired of buying
everybody else yachts and speedboats every year,'' said Spires.
``We didn't know just how well we were doing in those days until we
saw how our managers lived. We've decided that we want one now.''
</P>
<P>
   The All-Stars'new album, ``Crazy Again,'' was co-produced by
Johnson with Spires at his home studio in Muscle Shoals.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the leading Southern-rock bands originated in
Jacksonville, Fla., bands like Blackfoot and Skynyrd recorded some
of their earliest and most memorable tracks in Muscle Shoals.
</P>
<P>
   ``
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we needed to be here if we wanted to rekindle some of
that old magic,'' Geddes said.
</P>
<P>
   In between trips to Muscle Shoals for work on ``Crazy Again,''
the All-Stars have performed 60 gigs over the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole new crowd out there,'' Hlubek said. ``It's a
hodgepodge of people of all ages and from all kinds of backgrounds.
We've got people saying things like, `You've got to come out and
see this guy Jakson Spires _ he was the greatest when I was growing
up.' Then those people are bringing in their kids. It's great to
see the music carried on like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cuts from ``Crazy Again,'' the All-Stars'
colorful concert repertoire includes such Southern-rock anthems as
Blackfoot's ``Wishing Well,'' Molly Hatchet's ``Flirtin' with
Disaster'' (written by Hlubek), Marshall Tucker's ``Can't You
See?'' and Skynyrd's ``Sweet Home Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   The band even delves into the deep blues of ``Stormy Monday''
and roars through Rolling Stones territory with ``Jumpin' Jack
Flash.''
</P>
<P>
   The band began in the early '90s as the Dixie All-Stars
``Everybody thought we were a basketball team or some barbershop
band or something,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The group then endured a number of personnel changes, losing
members to ``everything from road burnout to suicide,'' before the
arrival of Geddes. ``He was the spoke that was missing,'' Hlubek
said, ``and now the wheel's turning.''
</P>
<P>
   The group works without lawyers, managers or agents, setting
their own standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done the record this way, too,'' Spires said. ``Pete
plays his part his way. Dave plays his guitar the way he plays it.
Jay and I may be called the producers, but we're saying to these
guys, `Come in here and play like you play not like I want to hear
you play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, fellow band members Hlubek and Geddes feel
secure being produced by trusted colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your fellow performer can get the best performance out of
you,'' Hlubek said. ``There's not some straw boss around telling us
what to do. Why do we want some guy coming in here producing our
record who can't play an E chord? In the end, whatever it is, it is
and we had a good time doing it.''

EFFECTIVE MUCKRAKING ON TIBET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the financial flop of both ``Kundun'' and ``Seven Years in
Tibet'' in late 1997, one Hollywood trade paper predicted it
``would be a long time before an American filmmaker made a
contemporary movie about Tibet again.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, barely a year later, here is ``Windhorse,'' another (albeit
smaller budget) U.S. film that sets its story against the brutal
Chinese subjugation of Tibet. It's an effective piece of muckraking
too, and perhaps somewhat more authentic, since part of it was
actually filmed in Tibet on the sly.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens in a village in the country's remote western
mountains in 1979, as a game played by three children _ Dorjee, his
sister Dolkar and their girl cousin Pema _ is interrupted by the
sound of a gun shot: their grandfather has just been casually
executed by a Chinese government death squad.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to 18 years later, and the three have moved to Lhasa, grown
up and developed quite different lifestyles: Dorjee is an aimless
slacker, Dolkar is the city's hottest cabaret singer and Pema is a
Buddhist nun and dedicated follower of the exiled Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the film deals with the way their scattered lives
come together again when Dolkar is given a lucrative television and
recording contract but is expected to sing songs praising Chairman
Mao and Pema is arrested after a spontaneous anti-Chinese
demonstration in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Directed, produced and co-written by Paul Wagner (who won an
Oscar for his documentary short, ``the Stone Carvers'') and shot
mostly in Nepal with a cast of Tibetan refugees, the film has
little of the epic sweep of its more expensive predecessors in the
Tibet-under-heel genre.
</P>
<P>
   And, like them, it's pretty much of a propaganda piece. We get
no hint, for instance, of China's motivation for being so nasty:
its long-standing fear of Tibet, which has historically been much
more militant than its ``Lost Horizon'' image might indicate, and
once even conquered and ruled China.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Windhorse'' is an effective piece of propaganda. Wagner
gets believable and heart-felt ensemble performances from his cast
of unknowns, his camera paints a devastating portrait of a
spiritually starved nation on its knees, and he has no trouble
convincing us that the Chinese occupation is barbaric and
intolerable.

DISPERSING TREASURES FOR A GOOD CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Giuseppe Rossi of Turin, Italy, was famous for his
connoisseurship, but he will be remembered for his generosity.
</P>
<P>
   Next week Sotheby's in London is selling Rossi's collection,
approximately 1,400 spectacular lots of 18th-century furniture,
Meissen porcelain, Italian silver and Chinese ceramics, with the
proceeds of the sale promised to a school of conservation and
restoration of the decorative arts, the Scuola per Artigiani
Restauratori d'Arte, in Turin.
</P>
<P>
   The collection, amassed between 1945 and 1979, is expected to
bring about $15 million, said Mario Tavella, Sotheby's furniture
specialist in London.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi was born in 1914 into a family of craftsmen; his father
and maternal grandfather were cabinetmakers in Turin, the capital
of the Piedmont region, in northwestern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, he was serious about his studies, but when the
Depression hit in 1929 he had to join the family's shop.
Eventually, he got back to his studies and graduated in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   He worked in the paper business until the war, when he was
drafted into the army. In 1944, he opened the Rossi Art Gallery,
selling antiques and decorative paintings, and quietly became a
connoisseur and very successful businessman. He traveled all over
the world to buy pieces for his gallery and private collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't a glamorous person,'' Tavella said, ``but he was
well known internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the estate of Rossi, who died 10 years ago, runs
from March 10 through March 12 and includes more than 700 pieces of
French and Italian furniture. In collecting Italian antiques for
himself, Rossi concentrated on examples from the Piedmont, Venice
and Genoa, particularly ones with lacquer, veneer and inlays of
ivory or precious woods like tulipwood, rosewood and ebony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piedmontese furniture has always been very desirable because
it's quite rare,'' Tavella said. ``A lot of Italian furniture is
regarded as provincial but not Piedmontese. It is seen as
international in taste and appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting Piedmontese pieces in the sale is a
bureau Mazarin, a writing desk, circa 1725. It is made of ebony and
rosewood. It has eight square tapering legs, three drawers on each
side and a cupboard and drawer above the kneehole space. It is
intricately inlaid with ivory scenes depicting foliage and human
figures.
</P>
<P>
   The piece is attributed to Luigi Prinotto, an accomplished Turin
cabinetmaker known for ivory inlays. There is a similar piece by
him in the Royal Palace's museum in Turin.
</P>
<P>
   In the desk at Sotheby's, the inlays depict hunting scenes and
banquets. Various cartouches show hounds roaring to get started on
the hunt. In one, they jump on their master in excitement; in
another, they circle a huntsman signaling with his horn. The
banquet scenes are alfresco: huge tables laden with foods that have
been laid out for the guests under a shade tree.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate is $193,000 to $290,000. ``It's very rich in taste
and very grand, almost flashy,'' Tavella said, ``but this is the
region the royal family came from.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deco Ironwork
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the mother of all decorative arts fairs. Italy, Russia,
Poland, the Netherlands, Austria, Britain, Spain, Czechoslovakia,
Japan, Denmark, Sweden and France _ in fact, every important
country except the United States _ participate. Set virtually in
the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, the fair lasts six months and
attracts 16 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
   This was the famous 1925 Paris ``Exposition Internationale des
Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes,'' which gave Art Deco its
name. The fair included fashion (think Paul Poiret); furniture
(Jean-Michel Frank); silver (Jean Puiforcat); decoration (Sue and
Mare, Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann); even architecture (Le Corbusier).
</P>
<P>
   It's taken more than 70 years, but now Americans are beginning
to appreciate the incomparable designers who emerged in France in
the early 1920s and changed the direction of design history.
Several of them are represented in auctions of 20th-century
decorative works of art next week.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sotheby's sale on March 12 includes pieces by Edgar
Brandt, a relatively underappreciated craftsman whose artistry and
close interactions with his contemporaries are explored by the
historian Joan Kahr in ``Edgar Brandt: Master of Art Deco
Ironwork,'' to be published by Abrams next month.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt (1880-1960) was a metalwork artist and entrepreneur who
started out making iron costume jewelry in 1900. He moved on to
larger-scale pieces like fireplace equipment and door knockers.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, he was making elaborate stairway railings festooned
with pine cone and needle motifs for private houses in Paris. He
was soon recognized as a master craftsman, with plenty of private
and commercial commissions for doors, gates, screens and monuments.
</P>
<P>
   He was 34 when he was drafted in World War I. Seeing the
conditions in the trenches, he suggested that the infantry needed a
maneuverable lightweight mortar. The French Army told him to make
one, and he spent two years developing it.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he returned to his ironwork atelier, where he
designed and manufactured fire screens, furniture, light fixtures
and doors for houses, banks and French government buildings. He was
commissioned to create glass domes and iron banisters for the ocean
liner Paris and the elaborate balconies and grand staircase for the
department store Au Bon Marche.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's is selling a pair of gilded Brandt gates, circa 1925.
Here the ironwork motif looks more like fiddlehead ferns. The
estimate is $60,000 to $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's also has a Brandt marble dining table, circa 1925,
with wrought-iron legs that curl up like ribbon candy. Here the
motifs are grapes and vine leaves. The estimate is $40,000 to
$60,000. A matching marble console with a mirror carries the
estimate of $30,000 to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt collaborated with talented peers, like the glassmakers
Rene Lalique and Antonin Daum. His work remained in demand until
the 1930s, when he began spending most of his time developing
armaments for the French government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to two sets of gates by Brandt, the Sotheby's sale
has an Armand Albert Rateau pedestal; two Gilbert Poillerat
wrought-iron doors, and an Albert Cheuret bronze and alabaster
chandelier.
</P>
<P>
   The Christie's sale of 20th-century decorative arts on March 18
includes a Brandt console; two fire screens and some lamps, as well
as a console designed by Cheuret; a set of Puiforcat silverware, a
Rene Prou console and a black lacquer screen, circa 1922, by Eileen
Gray.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to rediscover the second iron age, circa 1925.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While California students are showing some
improvement in reading scores, the state still ranks near the
bottom on the nationwide report card, according to a study released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reading scores on the 1998 National Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP) show that more than half of California's
fourth-graders are failing to read at the most basic level.
</P>
<P>
   While the average reading scores are up in the United States for
the first time in a decade, scores in the nation's biggest state
are anything but luminous: 52 percent of fourth-graders in
California scored below basic in reading, meaning they had a
less-than-partial mastery of fundamental skills; 28 percent scored
at a basic level, meaning they showed a partial mastery of reading
skills; 16 percent were proficient or showing solid academic
performance; and 4 percent were advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 39 percent of fourth-graders were below basic; 31
percent were at a basic level; 23 percent were proficient and 6
percent were advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Only students in the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Mississippi,
Louisiana and the Virgin Islands performed worse than those in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The scores for California are slightly higher in 1998 than in
1994 and 1992, the most recent years the exam was given.
</P>
<P>
   But because nearly all states saw scores inch upward, California
remains firmly planted near the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Eighth-graders in California did little better than
fourth-graders: 22 percent scored at the proficient level, compared
with 31 percent of eighth-graders nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The NAEP, taken every few years by a sampling of fourth-,
eighth- and 12th-graders in 39 states, Guam and at U.S. military
bases overseas, has been used as a national report card since it
was first issued in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a quarter of participating states showed statistically
significant improvements in fourth-grade reading this year. No
states lost ground and four states _ Delaware, Louisiana, South
Carolina and Virginia _ reversed declines in previous assessments.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the news is a measure of the progress we have made
together, it is also a yardstick showing how far we still need to
go,'' Vice President Al Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands
had fourth- and eighth-grade scores below the national average.
Besides California, those states were Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware,
Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New
Mexico and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many states that have been struggling are starting to see the
results of their hard work pay off in turning around their reading
scores,'' said U.S. Education Secretary Richard Riley. ``But, we
still have a very long way to go before we can rest easy. A
majority of students are not reading at the `proficient' level and
that is where we need to be.''

</P>
<P>
   Among the report's key findings for 1998:
</P>
<P>
   _ At all three grades _ fourth, eighth and 12th _ female
students outperformed male students; students who reported higher
levels of parental education had higher average scores than those
reporting less parental education; students eligible for free- or
reduced-Price lunch had lower average scores than students not
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   _ At grade four, Connecticut had the highest average score for
public school students. Other states scoring well: Colorado, Iowa,
Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   _ Results by region indicate that fourth- and eighth-graders in
the Northeast and central regions outperformed children in the
Southeast and West.
</P>
<P>
   _ At all three grades, students who reported watching three or
fewer hours of television each day had higher average reading
scores than students who reported watching more television.
</P>
<P>
   _ At all three grades, the average reading score for white and
Asian students was higher than for black, Hispanic and
Native-American students.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disparities in scores are pronounced and persistent
among ethnic and racial groups, the poor reading skills cut across
racial and socioeconomic lines.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of fourth-graders nationally who scored at or
above the proficient level by race and ethnicity was: 38 percent of
whites, 9 percent of blacks, 12 percent of Hispanics and 34 percent
of Asians.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of California fourth-graders scoring at the same
level, by ethnicity, was: 29 percent of whites, 7 percent of
blacks, 8 percent of Hispanics and 31 percent of Asians.

PREP-SCHOOL SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's happening at high school? Movies are depicting high
school kids as terminally abusive, mean-minded, irresponsible
creeps.
</P>
<P>
   In ``She's All That,'' an unpopular art student is first
humiliated and then transformed into a swan by the most popular
boy; in ``Jawbreakers,'' a group of girls are status-seeking sexual
teases and killers; and in ``The Craft,'' witchcraft is the tool
used for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as no surprise that someone would come up with the
idea to turn the 1782 novel ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' which has
already been filmed three times, into prep-school scandal and
sexual intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, writer and director Roger Kumble adapts his
teenage tantalizer more from Stephen Frears' successful film
``Dangerous Liaisons'' than from Laclos' classic book. As a result,
he doesn't bring much new to the party and his movie must rely on
eye candy of lavish, tony Manhattan locales rather than substance.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it's impossible to care about any of these
characters. Wealthy Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her idle,
cruel stepbrother, Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe), make sport of
manipulating, seducing and abandoning conquests. The pair are bored
and spoiled.
</P>
<P>
   After Kathryn gets dumped by beau Court Reynolds for the
unformed, innocent Cecile Caldwell (Selma Blair), Kathryn plots
revenge: She coerces Sebastian to seduce Cecile and take away the
one thing Court cares about _ Cecile's chastity. She promises him
that which he most desires if he succeeds: to sleep with her.
</P>
<P>
   But a virginal newcomer catches Sebastian's eye. Annette
Hargrove (Reese Witherspoon) has just arrived at the school. She's
a pillar of virtue. And she sees through all of Sebastian's plays
and poses. The young man finds his cynicism crumbling and soon, the
pawn holds the power and Sebastian finds he's in love for the first
time _ much to Kathryn's fury.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to use three budding stars _ Witherspoon, Phillippe and
Gellar (from TV's ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer'') _ might have
looked good on paper, but none has an ounce of conviction or
gravity onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   The only one who brings a whit of freshness to her role is
Blair, whose Cecile is a bumbling harebrain. The other paper-thin,
wooden performances feel like something from the high school annual
play rather than a big-budget movie.
</P>
<P>
   Though the film continually tries to be racy and attempts to
crack some taboos _ Kathryn teaches Cecile to kiss, the hint of
incest looms large, and there's even a racial subplot _ nothing
feels even tinged with threat, menace or conviction. The movie is
as boring as the characters, and by the time Sebastian performs a
final, redemptive act, the preview audience was laughing out loud
at the silliness of the whole mess.

A PLAYFUL, MOVING STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf has argued ``the European
cinema offers sex and violence, the Indian cinema sells dreams and
the Iranian cinema tries to sell poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Makhmalbaf ingeniously meshes pure cinematic visual imagery with
delicate, poetic stories. His 1996 film ``A Moment of Innocence''
is certainly no exception. But it's more personal and less
objective that his 1995 success, ``Gabbeh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to recapture my youth with a camera,'' says the
director and, indeed, the film chronicles a chance meeting between
an ex-policeman, who was stabbed some 20 years earlier in a
political act against the Shah's regime by Makhmalbaf, then a
17-year-old militant.
</P>
<P>
   The cop now wants to become an actor and asks the
internationally known director to put him in a film. Makhmalbaf
suggests they cinematically reconstruct this dramatic event instead
and the pair set out to cast the film with replicas of themselves
as young men, and to find the girl who was an instrumental witness
to the stabbing, and who became an icon of lost love for the now
40-year-old policeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Moment of Innocence'' slowly fits together like the pieces
of a puzzle, telling a playful, moving story of love and youthful
idealism. It weaves its characters _ old and young _ together in an
innovative way and proves that history doesn't necessarily need to
repeat itself to heal old wounds. In fact, the biggest hope in
excising old scars may be to change the course of history entirely.
In this case, through the medium of film.
</P>
<P>
   Though Makhmalbaf's movie is small in scope and often feels
improvised and rough, its ability to gaze back in time through more
mature eyes gives it an emotional and poignant resonance.

NIGHT COURT JOINS THE THEATER THAT IS NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JANNY SCOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The hour was closing in on midnight. A detachment of
ruddy-faced German tourists emerged from the metal detectors in the
Criminal Courts building in lower Manhattan, took a sharp left and
headed down the empty marble corridor toward the city's least
likely international attraction, night court.
</P>
<P>
   Tentatively, they filed into Room 130. They entered like
spelunkers, wide-eyed and hushed amid the cavernous courtroom's
disconcerting fluorescence. Wrestling off ski jackets, they settled
into several rows of dark wooden benches, looking eager, alert and
utterly out of place.
</P>
<P>
   The court stenographer squinted at them, then shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they came off a tour bus or something,'' she
muttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, this is in the tour books,'' said Judge Ruth
Pickholz, who was presiding that night. ``They should have been
here the night of the escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan makes its name on superlatives, so maybe it should
come as no surprise that in the only borough with 24-hour-a-day,
seven-day-a-week arraignments. The 5:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. shift at
arraignment court at 100 Centre Street near Chinatown is both a
tourist attraction and an occasional cheap date.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, post-O.J. Simpson America. Who is not
interested in sidebar conferences and orders to show cause? With
criminal lawyers serving as hosts of television talk shows and
Judge Judy becoming a celebrity, courtrooms are becoming a
daytime-television cliche. Night court, meanwhile, is the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Like much in Manhattan, night court is real-life theater. It is
the criminal-justice equivalent of a ringside seat at
emergency-room admissions. It is mostly pantomime, robbed of its
dialogue by bad acoustics, but it offers the curious visitor a hard
look at a sad slice of New York life.
</P>
<P>
   Hour after hour, the door to the holding pens behind the
courtroom bangs open and shut. Men and women with smudged faces and
sleep-flattened hair slouch before the judge. Charges are barked
out: heroin possession, fare-beating, possession of stolen
property. Lawyers argue in shorthand; the judge sets bail.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, something startling breaks the rhythm. Denied
bail, a defendant dares the court officers to force him to return
to the pens. Or as had happened in Judge Pickholz's courtroom
earlier that week, a man leaps the rail and tries to bolt, only to
be caught in the corridor and charged with escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider arraignments the E.R. of the court system,'' said
Judge Pickholz, a former lawyer with the New York Legal Aid Society
and former corruption prosecutor for the city. ``We triage. Some
cases need a Band-Aid. Some of them need major surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day, hundreds of people are arrested in Manhattan. Under
state law, the city has 24 hours to get them arraigned before a
judge, who will hear arguments from a prosecutor and usually a
court-appointed defense lawyer on, among other things, how high to
set bail.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, people used to languish in jail for days, unarraigned.
Then in 1990, the Legal Aid Society went to the state Supreme Court
and argued that the city was violating a law requiring arraignment
``without delay.'' In April of that year, a judge agreed and set
the limit at 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the arrest-to-arraignment time is usually less than
that. But a visitor to night court may be struck by the tension
between the pressure to deal quickly with the flow of ``bodies,''
in law-enforcement parlance, and the countervailing impulse to
treat the ``bodies'' as something more.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone finds the balance satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system believes in processing our clients, kind of like
cans of tuna fish,'' said Stephen P. Pokart, a Legal Aid lawyer who
has worked in night court often since 1980. ``They don't recognize
them as humans. They are species as paperwork, species as
statistic, the species defendant.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the western rim of Chinatown, the vast Criminal
Courts building is an awesome place. ``Where law ends there tyranny
begins,'' reads the inscription on one wall. Homeless men can be
seen bedding down along the sidewalk, while litter swirls in windy
eddies near the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Room 130 is the bigger of the two arraignment courtrooms, a room
so archetypal that Barbra Streisand replicated it for her 1987
movie ``Nuts.'' The cracks in the benches appear in places to have
been spackled with now petrified chewing gum; even tourists look
pallid under the 11 overhead lights.
</P>
<P>
   A low rail divides the room _ public on one end, lawyers and
accused on the other. There is an interview booth for lawyers and
clients, reminiscent of a confessional. Up near the ceiling, there
are eight tall, rectangular windows, their Venetian blinds in
varying degrees of disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Judge John Walsh, a former police inspector who oversees
arraignments throughout the city, recalls watching from the bench
some years ago as a pigeon flew into the courtroom through an open
window, circled the room as if according to long habit, then came
blithely to rest in an indoor nest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see what's on that screen?'' he asked a visitor one
afternoon, pointing out a mysterious constellation of small white
globs on an out-of-use video monitor that had come to rest on top
of the interview booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spitballs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of characters at night court is shifting yet somehow
constant. Criminal- and civil-court judges are assigned in rotating
five-night shifts. The lawyers cycle in and out, too. Only the
court officers are regulars, a tight-knit group with a shared
social life outside of court.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for the accused, they have a certain superficial sameness. If
they look as if they slept in their clothes, they did. They appear
weary and bedraggled; some are sick. Told to keep their coats with
them, many stand before the judge in down jackets, as though
expecting snow.
</P>
<P>
   Some stare at their feet, hands behind their backs. Some list to
one side, looking warily at the judge. Some chortle in disbelief at
the prosecutor's account. Some are mentally ill; many are indigent.
Some are in withdrawal; a few are diabetics in danger of insulin
shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great deal of trouble getting credibility with our
clients, for all sorts of socio-economic and other reasons,'' said
Pokart, 58, who joined the Legal Aid Society, a nonprofit agency
that provides representation for indigent defendants, after
graduating from Harvard Law School, then getting a degree in
theater directing and running soldier shows in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients often ask us, `Are you a paid lawyer?''' he said.
``You can make a joke and say, `No, I do this for the fun of it.'
So they smile, maybe. But they think of us as not paid lawyers
because they're not paying us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So, we're not `paid lawyers,''' he continued. ``Generally
we're white and they're not. We're well dressed and they're not.
We're educated and they're not. We're out of jail and they're in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he said, many of them have been badly represented
by incompetent lawyers before. He added, ``So there is a great deal
of mistrust.''
</P>
<P>
   Each arraignment tends to follow a pattern. A defendant is
brought into the courtroom through the door leading to the holding
cells and is deposited on one of several wooden benches. There he
is left to wait with maybe a dozen other men and women, their backs
to the public, until a court officer calls his case.
</P>
<P>
   Cases are announced in a loud, barely intelligible rush of
terminology. The defendant takes his place next to his lawyer, whom
he met minutes earlier in an interview booth adjoining the pens.
The prosecutor asks that bail be at a certain level; the defense
wants it lower.
</P>
<P>
   If the defendant's mother is in the courtroom, she is pointed
out _ an indication that the accused might be counted on to come
back to court. The defense lawyer might talk about the client's
job, if he has one, or his medical condition, if he has one, and
how he will suffer if held in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to help them as lawyers,'' said Pokart, who once
tossed a client's glass eye to a judge while making the case that
the client could not keep it clean in jail. ``If they're locked up
at arraignment, helping them as a lawyer means to get them out of
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the judge's turn.
</P>
<P>
   He or she skims a sheaf of papers: a one-page complaint; the
defendant's rap sheet; a brief report on where he lives, how long
he has lived there, whether he works, where he works, and a bail
recommendation from the private agency that the city uses to
prepare such reports and recommend bail.
</P>
<P>
   The judge then has a minute or two to set bail. Maybe three.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not decisive, they had better become decisive very
quickly,'' said Walsh, who retired as a police officer, was sworn
in as a judge and hit night court all in the same week. ``You have
to make decisions and there's no second call, no let-me-think or
what-do-you-think? You're the one.''
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the decisions are hard and the judge has little
information to go on. ``I've never had something bad happen,''
Judge Pickholz said. ``That's every judge's nightmare. That's the
one thing you don't want to be responsible for _ having somebody
get hurt because of something you've done.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pressure lifts briefly when the court breaks for dinner
around 9 p.m. It is a segregated ritual: Judges gravitate to
Forlini's, a nearby Italian restaurant, defense lawyers to
Chinatown, court officers to their desks. When they return, many
are fighting exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Other tasks punctuate the night. Some defendants, charged with
misdemeanors, plead guilty and must be sentenced. Sometimes orders
of protection and search warrants need to be signed. Often, there
are defendants with drug problems that jail will not help and who
have no other place to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get yourself some help,'' Judge Pickholz told a
woman, who was 41 but looked 60, limping toward the bench to be
arraigned on yet another misdemeanor drug charge. ``Do you know
that? Because you're going to end up in jail or dead on the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman nodded blankly. A tourist dozing in the second row
snapped awake. It was well past midnight. The defense lawyer and
the prosecutor huddled with the judge. ``She's a lost soul,'' the
judge said quietly. ``If you want to help get her into a program,
I'm not going to keep her in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the woman had a record, the prosecutor agreed to reduce
the charge from a misdemeanor to a lesser category called a
violation. That way, the woman could plead guilty and not be
charged with violating her probation. Maybe she would even get
help.
</P>
<P>
   The judge thanked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a place for DA's like you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   He answered, ``I hope they send me there soon.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS MEMBERS STRUGGLE TO BALANCE DUTIES AND FAMILY
 &HT;    780&AMP;add. For release Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In order to be elected, members of Congress must
promise to tirelessly serve their districts. They also must
demonstrate their devotion to family.
</P>
<P>
   Living up to both can be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job is becoming more demanding all the time,'' said Rep.
Chet Edwards, D-Texas, who recalls when Congress met only six
months a year, allowing lawmakers to spend a great deal of time
working in their home communities.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed. The congressional schedule is longer and
more unpredictable, leaving lawmakers constantly running in and out
of airports. The long hours, the stress of political life and the
grueling travel schedule can strain families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of politicians who glow in the limelight while
their children and families are dying in the shadows,'' said
Edwards. ``That is one mistake I will never make.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is much too short to spend four or five days a week
regularly away from your children and spouse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many political families, Edwards and his wife, Lea Ann,
decided to raise their two children, John Thomas, 3, and Garrison,
1, in their home district. As a result, John Thomas made about 20
airplane trips before his first birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the couple decided to move the family from Waco to the
national capital area _ an option often taken by senators, who
serve six years rather than two for House members.
</P>
<P>
   One reason behind the Edwards' decision is the House schedule,
which is already intense and may grow longer.
</P>
<P>
   Many members say the schedule is not ``family friendly,'' with
morning hearings, votes starting at midday and sometimes ending
long after a child's bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   Some still talk about the stressful year of 1995, when
Republican efforts to pass the party's ``family-friendly'' Contract
With America took an ironic toll on their personal life. At least
six 1994 freshmen ended up with broken marriages by 1996, and some
say the long hours and last-minute schedule changes played a big
part.
</P>
<P>
   Before deciding to resign from Congress, incoming Speaker Bob
Livingston proposed a five-day-a-week House schedule instead of the
current practice of conducting most business from Tuesday through
Thursday. The proposal, which members say is still under
consideration, would make it impossible for members to fly home to
work in their districts for half the week.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the five-day schedule would make House service
more predictable and allow more weeks off during the year.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., said it would be a ``disaster''
for members with families in their districts.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler spent the first few months of his first term living in
Washington while his wife and three children lived in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't do it,'' he said. ``It was extremely hard. I
cannot tell you how many times at 2, 3, 4 in the night I was on the
phone with my wife because she was up with the baby. In the most
perfect of marriages, it creates strain.''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler moved his family to the capital area more than a year
ago. ``That's not so easy either,'' he said. The Wexlers left both
sets of grandparents and a network of community support in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cynthia McKinney, who is divorced, commutes to Decatur,
Ga., at least twice a week. Her 13-year-old son Coy lives in
Georgia and stays with McKinney's parents when she is in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney said the choice of letting Coy grow up in Georgia
provides ``normalcy'' and a certain ``anonymity,'' while the
capital area is less than an ideal environment for raising
children.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, she said, ``everybody is the child of somebody
important. The sense of self-importance, I believe, gets blown way
out of proportion and you certainly don't want your children to get
infected with that disease.''
</P>
<P>
   But McKinney said living part-time away from her son is not
easy. About a month ago, she was reading some of her son's school
essays and realized her congressional schedule had a
``devastating'' impact on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that the job took his Mom away from him,'' she said.
``I felt terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney said the essay prompted her to be even more dedicated
to incorporating her son's life into her schedule and to improve
communication between them.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to help his colleagues avoid such pitfalls, Rep. Jack
Kingston, R-Ga., recently wrote an article in The Hill, a weekly
political newspaper, titled ``15 Ways to Keep your Family, Sanity
and Inner Harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingston advised lawmakers not to confuse their spouse with
their staff. ``Remember, your staff works for you _ your spouse
doesn't. You've already screwed up (your spouse's) life _ don't add
insult to injury.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Politicians are not alone in their growing concern about
balancing family life and work.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Covey and his brother Stephen have made millions of
dollars teaching people how to find such balance in their lives.
Stephen Covey is the author of ``The 7 Habits of Highly Effective
People,'' which has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Covey, who has developed and edited a new book about
``Highly Effective Families,'' gave a two-hour seminar at a
Democratic congressional retreat in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message hit them right in the bread basket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Covey told lawmakers to ``put the big rocks'' into their busy
schedules. The big rocks included one-on-one time with their spouse
and children and important family dates such as birthdays, planned
vacations and family traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Covey said politics has become more difficult in an age of
``information overload.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The political pressures are incredible,'' he said. ``The boss
is not only in the political arena, but you've got the media that
are just pushing'' and watching ``for any public or private
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a multiple stress for these people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who said he has taken a lot of Covey's advice to heart,
said that after 16 years in politics, he knows the world doesn't
revolve around his political career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The democracy will go on without Chet Edwards, but those
children only have one father,'' he said.
</P>

 &HT;    BILL WOULD PROTECT CHILDREN AGAINT INTERNET PORNOGRAPHY
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington category
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - The virtual version of Solace House, a therapeutic
center in Leawood, Kan., that serves grieving children and their
families after loved ones have been lost, appeared on the Internet
one day in December. Within hours, its creators found to their
dismay that would-be visitors could all too easily be mistakenly
linked to several hardcore pornographic sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no black screen, no warning, no way to exit,
nothing,'' Janie Harris, executive director of Solace House, told
the Senate Commerce Committee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said she'd like to see enacted what she called a federal
''seat belt law'' to protect children against pornography. ''If it
were up to each community, we wouldn't have any seat belt law,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation under construction by the panel's chairman, Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., would provide what Harris wants. It would
impact some 26,000 U.S. schools and libraries that so far have been
awarded $1.7 billion in subsidies to hook up to the Internet. Under
his bill, to qualify for future funding, they would be required to
deploy blocking or filtering software on computers being used by
children.
</P>
<P>
   Said McCain: ``Parents have the right to feel safe that, when
they send their child to school, when they drop their child off at
the public library, someone is going to be looking out for their
children, protecting them. That's what this bill is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, trembling visibly in the witness chair, told the panel
that pornographic images appeared if Internet users looking for the
Solace House site typed in ``www.solace.com'' instead of the
correct address: ``www.solacehouse.org.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris promptly launched a fight to shut down the offending
site, which was hosted in Canada. Within three weeks, the owner had
yanked the pornography and replaced it with an ``under
construction'' message.
</P>
<P>
   Although the courts have upheld child pornography laws, McCain's
bill has run into furious opposition from civil liberties groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal filtering mandates would increase legal problems,
impose unjustified federal requirements on schools and libraries
and interfere with local efforts to deal more effectively with
Internet access issues,'' Elliot Mincberg, (cq), general counsel of
People for the American Way,'' told McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While sharing McCain's concerns that ``children's experience on
the Internet be safe, educational and rewarding,'' Candace Morgan,
a librarian from Fort Vancouver, Wash., said people in her
community oppose his filtering initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``They support the approach of individual choice of
technological tools with parents making choices for their
children,'' she said. ``They do not want the library, or any other
governmental agency, to force one choice on all library users.''
</P>
<P>
   A shaken Harris thereupon turned to Morgan, who sat beside her
at the witness table, and said: ``A lot of kids don't have a parent
to guide them. That's our nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain accused Morgan of not having read his bill,
a charge which she denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you decide not to use the (installed filtering) system,
then don't use it,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under this legislation, you must install the technology but
you don't have to turn it on,'' Sen. John Rockefeller, D-W.Va.,
noted. That option could assist McCain's approach in the courts, if
his bill is enacted into law. A prior bid to censor Internet
content, while signed into law by President Clinton, was deemed
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   McCain told Morgan that when committee staffers had run the
librarian's name through several Internet search engines, they had
found two pornographic sites linked to ``Candace Morgan'' and five
sites to ``Candice Morgan.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was not happy to hear that.
</P>
<P>
   Said McCain, who will seek the Republican presidential
nomination next year: ``If (schools and libraries) don't want this
responsibility, the answer is simple: don't take the subsidy.''

ISTANBUL IS THE STAR

<P>
   There's a belief exotic places such as Istanbul, India and
Tangier can change a traveler's life forever. Writers Paul Bowles
and Somerset Maugham, among others, have long extolled the impact
of these far-off worlds upon the western mindset.
</P>
<P>
   In Ferzan Ozpetek's 1996 mosaic tapestry, ``Steam: The Turkish
Bath,'' the city of Istanbul provides the impetus for change to an
Italian couple, Francesco (Alessandro Gassman) and Marta (Francesca
d'Aloja).
</P>
<P>
   Francesco's aunt dies and leaves him her estate, including
``hamam,'' or a traditional Turkish steam bath, and he moves from
Rome to Istanbul to renovate the crumbling, unrepaired old
structure.
</P>
<P>
   Istanbul warms Francesco. He finds his place in the world as
well as his true sexual orientation. He falls in love with Mehmet
(Mehmet Gunsur), the son of the hamam's keeper. Marta
simultaneously announces she wants a divorce. But the allure and
old world pull of the city has also taken Marta by surprise and
she, too, becomes a different person under its spell.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its drama, the real star of ``Steam: The Turkish Bath''
isn't the actors or their sexual activities. It's the enchantment
of the city of Istanbul, which, with its Moorish architecture,
primary colors and food-filled social traditions, feels inviting
and warm.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, ``Steam'' has a fractured script that injects dramatic
plot points without any set-up or purpose. By the end, when a
tragedy alters everything, we haven't a clue why or where the event
originated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steam: The Turkish Bath'' was pulled as an Oscar entry for
best foreign film by the Turkish government because of its racy
``subtext.'' That seems like an overreaction. The sex scenes
between Francesco and Mehmet are as tame as the movie itself and
come off more as studied tableaux than steamy eroticism.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Justice Harry A. Blackmun, a modest midwestern
Republican who became a passionate defender of the right to
abortion during 24 years on the Supreme Court, died Thursday at the
age of 90.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun, who retired from the court five years ago, died of
complications following hip replacement surgery, the court
announced. He underwent the procedure last week, following a fall
at his home in suburban Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In his retirement, he was a frequent visitor to the court, where
staff members and former law clerks helped celebrate his 90th
birthday in November. He made his movie debut in 1997, playing a
cameo role as Justice Joseph Story in the Stephen Spielberg film
``Amistad.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun was well aware that despite an active, 62-year career
as a lawyer and judge, his name would be forever linked to the
issue of abortion and to opinion that bore his signature, Roe v.
Wade.
</P>
<P>
   When Harry Blackmun took his seat on the Supreme Court on June
9, 1970, few people would have predicted that this soft-spoken,
61-year-old judge, a lifelong Republican never known for breaking
new ground or challenging the status quo, was about to embark on an
extraordinary personal journey that by the time he retired 24 years
later would find him as one of the last remaining liberal voices on
a transformed court.
</P>
<P>
   Not even three years into his tenure, Blackmun guaranteed his
place in the country's judicial, political and social history as
the author of Roe v. Wade, the decision that established a
constitutional right for women to obtain abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In that opinion, on which Blackmun labored for more than a year,
the court found constitutional protection for ``a right of personal
privacy'' that is ``broad enough to encompass a woman's decision
whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote in Roe v. Wade was 7-2, an indication that far from
being solely the product of Blackmun's personal vision, the
decision reflected a broad consensus on the court that the time had
come to end the criminal prohibitions against abortion that in 1973
were still retained by most states. Even such a conservative member
of the court as Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Blackmun's boyhood
friend from St. Paul, Minn., joined the opinion that he had
assigned Blackmun to write.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it was Blackmun who became the personal symbol of
the abortion issue that assumed an increasingly dominant, and
divisive, role in U.S. politics. Abortion opponents flooded his
chambers at the court with tens of thousands of letters. ``Think of
any name; I've been called it in these letters,'' he said in a 1983
interview. When he appeared in public, even years after the
decision, Blackmun was sometimes confronted by pickets and
hecklers.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his career on the court, as the majority in
favor of a constitutional right to abortion dwindled, Blackmun
became another kind of symbol as a grim survivor of what looked
like a judicial counter-revolution. In 1989, the court voted in
Webster v. Reproductive Health Services to uphold a Missouri law
that restricted access to abortion. The 5-to-4 decision did not
overturn Roe v. Wade, but indicated that the framework of the 1973
decision no longer commanded a majority on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun, then 80 years old, read his dissenting opinion in a
tense and hushed courtroom. ``I fear for the future,'' he said.
``The signs are evident and very ominous, and a chill wind blows.''
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent retirements of Justices William J. Brennan Jr. in
1990 and Thurgood Marshall the next year left Blackmun as the only
remaining member of the Roe v. Wade majority still serving on the
court. Roe v. Wade did indeed appear doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this intensely unhappy period for Blackmun ended not in
defeat but in a personal triumph when, in a 1992 decision that took
much of the country by surprise, a new majority coalesced to
preserve and even to solidify the constitutional right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The plurality opinion in that case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey,
reaffirmed what it called the ``essential holding'' of Roe v. Wade,
the right of a woman to choose abortion during the first six months
of pregnancy, before the fetus is able to live outside the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun did not agree with all of the plurality's opinion,
which was written jointly by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony
M. Kennedy, and David H. Souter. He would have struck down all the
abortion regulations in the Pennsylvania law that was before the
court, while the plurality opinion upheld most of them.
</P>
<P>
   But he, along with Justice John Paul Stevens, signed the portion
of the opinion reaffirming the constitutional framework for the
right to abortion. ``Just when many expected the darkness to fall,
the flame has grown bright,'' he wrote in a separate opinion. He
commended Justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Souter for ``an act of
personal courage and constitutional principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun also used his separate opinion to underscore the
fragility of the court's support for the right to abortion, since a
dissenting opinion signed by four justices had called for Roe v.
Wade to be overturned. ``I fear for the darkness as four justices
anxiously await the single vote necessary to extinguish the
light,'' he said, adding: ``I am 83 years old. I cannot remain on
this court forever.'' He predicted a fierce confirmation battle for
whoever was named to succeed to his seat.
</P>
<P>
   But that battle did not materialize. By the time Blackmun
announced, on April 6, 1994, that he would retire at the end of
court's 1993-94 term, a Democrat was in the White House. The margin
of support for abortion rights on the court was a solid 6-to-3, the
result of President Bill Clinton's choice of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to
replace Justice Byron R. White, a long-time opponent of Roe v. Wade
who retired in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed Blackmun, Clinton chose Stephen G. Breyer, a federal
appeals court judge who was widely assumed to support abortion
rights, although he did not say so explicitly. In any event, Breyer
was easily confirmed after a four-day hearing in which the right to
abortion _ no longer perceived as being at stake _ never became an
issue.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Over the years, in reviewing his career in interviews and
conversations, Blackmun rebuffed suggestions that he had changed
since President Richard Nixon chose him for the court in 1970. The
court had changed around him, he would insist.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly had, and yet the evidence of his own evolution was
unmistakeable. He himself provided the most direct and dramatic
evidence just months before his retirement, when he announced that
after years of joining Supreme Court opinions that upheld the death
penalty, he had concluded that ``the death penalty experiment has
failed'' and that it was time for the court to abandon the
``delusion'' that capital punishment could be carried out in a
manner consistent with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the
machinery of death,'' Blackmun wrote. The vehicle for his
announcement was a 22-page opinion dissenting from the court's
refusal to hear an appeal from a Texas death-row inmate, Bruce E.
Callins.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing unusual about the crime _ a barroom murder _
for which the inmate had been sentenced to die. For Blackmun, its
very ordinariness demonstrated that the death penalty could never
be other than random or arbitrary despite the court's best efforts
to make it even-handed and fair. Callins had been sentenced to
death while many others who committed similarly brutal crimes of
opportunity were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that the decision whether a human being should live
or die is so inherently subjective, rife with all of life's
understandings, experiences, prejudices and passions, that it
inevitably defies the rationality and consistency required by the
Constitution,'' Blackmun wrote in his dissenting opinion, which no
other justice joined. He acknowledged that he would not quickly win
converts to his point of view, but said he believed the court would
agree with him in time. ``I may not live to see that day, but I
have faith that eventually it will arrive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His death penalty stance was only the most notable example of
the transformation in Blackmun's social vision and in his view of
the role of the court. A successful middle-aged lawyer and judge
when he came to the court, Blackmun brought with him a certain
Midwestern complacency and belief that the government worked well
for most people most of the time without intervention from the
federal judiciary. Over the years, he came to see the court as an
essential voice for the vulnerable and powerless.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution was quite swift. For example, in 1973, Blackmun
wrote the opinion for a 5-4 majority in United States v. Kras,
upholding a provision of federal bankruptcy law that required
people filing for bankruptcy to pay a $50 fee. The fee was
challenged, as a denial of constitutional due process, by a man who
asserted that he was too poor to pay it.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun's opinion for the court said that it was reasonable for
Congress to want to make the bankruptcy system pay for itself;
Congress could provide for a waiver of the fee, but was not
constitutionally required to do so. He noted that the law permitted
the fee to be paid in installments over a period of nine months,
for a weekly payment ``less than the price of a movie and little
more than the cost of a pack or two of cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   This observation provoked a sharp rejoinder from Marshall, who
said in a dissenting opinion that movie-going by poor people,
``which the majority seems to believe is an almost weekly
activity,'' is in fact a rare luxury. Marshall added: ``It is
disgraceful for an interpretation of the Constitution to be
premised upon unfounded assumptions about how people live.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1977, Blackmun had come to a strikingly different view of the
extent of the government's obligations to the poor. In Beal v. Doe,
the court ruled that states participating in the federal Medicaid
program of medical care for the poor were not required to pay for
abortions. Blackmun and Marshall were on the same side this time,
in dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun wrote: ``There is `another world' out there, the
existence of which the court, I suspect, either chooses to ignore
or fears to recognize. And so the cancer of poverty will continue
to grow. This is a sad day for those who regard the Constitution as
a force that would serve justice to all evenhandedly and, in so
doing, would better the lot of the poorest among us.''
</P>
<P>
   During his first few years on the court, Blackmun's votes so
closely paralleled those of the chief justice, Burger, that he
appeared to be in his old friend's shadow. While the two were
popularly identified as the ``Minnesota Twins,'' the derisive label
also carried the clear implication that Blackmun was the junior
twin.
</P>
<P>
   The label lingered after it had long become outdated. By the
court's 1985-86 term, Burger's last year on the bench, the two were
voting together less than half the time in cases in which the court
was not unanimous. The chief justice rarely asked Blackmun to write
opinions in important or even interesting cases.
</P>
<P>
   Their earlier friendship _ Blackmun had been best man at the
Burgers' wedding in 1933 _ cooled considerably. In civil liberties
cases, particularly, Blackmun was much more likely to vote with
Justices Brennan and Marshall than with the court's conservatives.
By the end of his career, after those two justices had retired and
Blackmun became the court's senior associate justice, his was the
most reliable voice for civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paradoxically, by donning the robes of high office, Justice
Blackmun became less isolated from the everyday world and more
aware of the human beings behind the cases,'' one of his former law
clerks, Professor Harold Hongju Koh of Yale Law School, wrote in
The New York Times after Blackmun announced his retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took, his job seriously and did his own work,'' Koh wrote.
``The court's sprawling docket exposed him to a broader, more
brutal slice of life than he had ever known.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun's survivors include his wife, the former Dorothy Clark,
and their daughters, Dr. Nancy C. Blackmun, a psychologist, of
Framingham, Mass.; Sally Ann Blackmun, a lawyer, of Orlando, Fla.,
and Susan Blackmun, a freelance writer, also of Orlando, and five
grandchildren.

</P>
<P>
   Blackmun's appointment to the Supreme Court was the result of
political happenstance. It came at a time in his life when many
people are beginning to think about retirement. He had already had
a multifaceted legal career, first in private practice with a big
law firm, then as resident counsel to the Mayo Clinic, and finally
as a federal appeals court judge for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   He was Nixon's third choice to fill the vacancy created by the
forced resignation of Justice Abe Fortas, who left the bench amid
reports that he had accepted lecture fees and a legal retainer
while serving on the court. The Senate rejected Nixon's first two
choices, Clement F. Haynsworth Jr., a federal appeals court judge
from South Carolina, and G. Harrold Carswell, a U.S. district judge
from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's action frustrated the Nixon administration's plan
to name a Southerner to the court. Nixon then looked north in
search of a noncontroversial nominee who could be easily confirmed
and who at the same time would fit the requirement the president
had set for a ``law and order'' judge.
</P>
<P>
   Burger, whom Nixon had named to the Supreme Court the year
before, suggested his friend Harry Blackmun. Within a month,
Blackmun was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 94-0. The Supreme
Court seat once occupied by such justices as Oliver Wendell Holmes,
Benjamin N. Cardozo and Felix Frankfurter had been vacant for a
year by the time Blackmun took the oath of office.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the events that led to his nomination, Blackmun later
referred to himself wryly as ``Old Number Three.'' He gently passed
the nickname on to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the
Supreme Court in 1988 after the failure of President Reagan's first
two choices for the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice
Lewis F. Powell Jr.
</P>
<P>
   As a judge on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, he was
known for quiet diligence. The 8th Circuit covers seven states from
Minnesota south to Arkansas. Blackmun kept his chambers in
Rochester, Minn. He wrote over 200 opinions for the appeals court,
later citing as his favorite a case called Jackson v. Bishop, which
banned the use of whips for punishing prisoners in the Arkansas
prison system.
</P>
<P>
   He had been recommended to President Eisenhower for the seat on
the 8th Circuit by Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, a former
mayor of Minneapolis whose political career Blackmun had quietly
supported. Warren Burger, then an Eisenhower appointee to the
federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., also urged his
nomination. Blackmun was a Republican but, as his admiration for
the liberal Humphrey indicated, his approach to politics and public
affairs was nonpartisan and nonideological.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Andrew Blackmun was born Nov. 12, 1908 in Nashville, Ill.,
the son of Corwin Manning Blackmun and the former Theo Reuter. His
mother's family owned a flour mill in Nashville. The family moved
to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area when he was a small child. He grew
up in St. Paul, where his father worked in several businesses, at
one point running a hardware store. His mother was a talented
musician and passed on to her son a lifelong interest in a wide
variety of music.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor in the working-class Dayton Bluffs section of St.
Paul was Warren Burger. The two boys went to elementary school
together and delivered newspapers after school.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives diverged when, after high school, Burger went on to
the University of Minnesota while the Harvard Club of Minnesota
offered Harry Blackmun a scholarship to Harvard. Working as a
janitor and tutor to earn additional money, he compiled an
impressive academic record. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and
graduated summa cum laude in 1929 with a degree in mathematics.
Faced with a close choice between law school and medical school, he
chose Harvard Law School but retained a lifelong interest in and
respect for the medical profession.
</P>
<P>
   He did well in law school, graduating in 1932 and accepting a
federal appeals court clerkship back in Minnesota with an 8th
Circuit judge, John B. Sanborn. It was Sanborn whom he succeeded on
the appeals court 27 years later. Sanborn presided at the
swearing-in of his former law clerk, commenting that ``Harry is the
best legal scholar I have ever known.''
</P>
<P>
   After his clerkship, he taught for a year at a local law school,
the St. Paul College of Law, now known as the William Mitchell
College of Law. Warren Burger had received his law degree there two
years earlier, attending at night while working during the day as
an insurance salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun then joined a prestigious Minneapolis law firm, Dorsey,
Colman, Barker, Scott &AMP; Barber. He spent 16 years there, working on
tax and estate cases and on the firm's longtime representation of
the Mayo Clinic, the well-known medical research and treatment
center in Rochester, Minn. Among other duties, he probated the
wills of the Mayo brothers, who had founded the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, he left private practice to become general counsel of
the clinic. He spent nearly 10 years in that position, a period he
later said was the happiest in his professional life. The job let
him apply his legal skills to his lifelong interest in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, whom he married in 1941, were also raising
three daughters during this period. The Blackmuns had met on a
municipal tennis court in 1937, and their long marriage was very
much a public love affair to those who knew them. In a 1983
interview, he lamented that the court's heavy workload and the
demands of his life as a justice made the job ``unfair'' to his
wife, who is known as Dottie. ``It's lonely for her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Around the court, where he had breakfast in the public cafeteria
with his four law clerks each morning, few tourists would have
picked Harry Blackmun out as a justice. He never acquired a trace
of self-importance. He was modest in both his manner and
appearance, rarely wearing a suit to work. He was a good
storyteller and excellent mimic, using that skill to devastating
effect in deadpan impersonations of his colleagues on the court.
Trim and sprightly even in advanced age, he exercised daily in the
Supreme Court gym.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackmuns spent a portion of many summers in Aspen, Colo.,
where he helped lead a seminar on ``justice and society'' for
corporate executives at the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies.
Robert McDuffie, a young violinist the Blackmuns met at the music
festival in Aspen, became a close family friend. Blackmun took
great pride in McDuffie's increasingly successful career, and he
arranged several private recitals for McDuffie and other well-known
musicians at the court. The singer Bobby Short was among those who
performed at the afternoon concerts.
</P>
<P>
   One of his great loves in addition to music was baseball. One of
his early opinions, Flood v. Kuhn, in 1972, reaffirmed professional
baseball's longstanding immunity from federal antitrust law. What
was notable about this opinion was not so much the result as the
long excursion that its author took through the history of
baseball. Blackmun even quoted from ``Casey at the Bat'' and listed
his favorite players. In a 1987 television interview, Blackmun
noted that some people, including some Supreme Court colleagues,
had viewed the opinion as ``beneath the dignity of the court.'' But
he said: ``I would do it over again because I think baseball
deserved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in his Supreme Court tenure, Blackmun acquired a
reputation as a slow writer who took a long time to make up his
mind. In a 1983 interview in The New York Times Magazine, he
conceded that he had disregarded, at his peril, a piece of advice
that Justice Hugo Black gave him when he first arrived at the
court. He quoted Black as telling him: ``Harry, never display agony
in public, in an opinion. Never say that this is an agonizing,
difficult decision. Always write it as though it's clear as
crystal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Blackmun said: ``I probably agonize over cases
more than I should, and more than most of my colleagues do. I
always have done that, and it's something I haven't been able to
get over. But at the same time, once a decision has been made, I
don't lose any sleep over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun did not hide the fact that some cases engaged his
emotions. ``Poor Joshua!'' he exclaimed in a 1989 opinion,
dissenting from the majority's view that a state had no
constitutional duty to protect a child from brutality at the hands
of his father. Blackmun's critics accused him of substituting
sentimentality for legal reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun's changing approach to cases involving unconventional
behavior or defiance of government authority marked his evolution
on the court. In his early years, he took the government's side in
such cases almost automatically. For example, in 1971 he dissented
in the Pentagon Papers case, in which the court refused the Nixon
administration's request to block The Times and The Washington Post
from publishing portions of a classified history of the war in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He also dissented in another 1971 case, Cohen v. California, in
which the court ruled that a person could not be prosecuted simply
for wearing a jacket bearing an obscene epithet. Justice John M.
Harlan's majority opinion, noting that ``one man's vulgarity is
another's lyric,'' said that the First Amendment protected even a
``distasteful'' a message. Blackmun, in his dissenting opinion,
called wearing the jacket an ``absurd and immature antic.'' He
said, ``this court's agonizing over First Amendment values seems
misplaced and unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, Blackmun forcefully dissented from the
court's refusal to extend the constitutional right to privacy to
homosexual behavior between consenting adults. His dissenting
opinion, in Bowers v. Hardwick, was marked by a tone of acceptance
and understanding of a lifestyles other than his own. ``A necessary
corollary of giving individuals freedom to choose how to conduct
their lives is acceptance of the fact that different individuals
will make different choices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Blackmun's most important majority opinions was Bates v.
State Bar of Arizona, a 1977 decision recognizing a First Amendment
right for lawyers to advertise the price as well as the
availability of their services. His opinion traced the history of
the organized bar's rule against advertising, finding its roots in
the profession's self-image as being above the ``unseemly''
business of earning a living.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1978 affirmative action case, Regents of the University of
California v. Bakke, Blackmun voted in partial dissent to uphold a
state medical school's special minority admissions program, which a
5-4 majority found unconstitutional. In his separate opinion,
Blackmun wrote:``In order to get beyond racism, we must first take
account of race. There is no other way.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt, nothing else Blackmun ever wrote had as great an
effect or was scrutinized as carefully as his 50-page opinion in
Roe v. Wade, issued on Jan. 22, 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The case had been developed by a team of lawyers seeking to end
the era of criminal abortion prohibitions. It was filed under the
pseudonym Jane Roe on behalf of a Texas woman whose real name was
Norma McCorvey. Under Texas law, the performance of an abortion
that was not necessary to save a woman's life was a crime
punishable by two to five years in prison. As a result, Ms.
McCorvey had been unable to find a doctor to terminate her
pregnancy; by the time the case reached the Supreme Court, she had
carried the pregnancy to term and given the baby up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   The care with which Blackmun approached the issue was evident
from the opening passage of his opinion, in which he acknowledged
``the deep and seemingly absolute convictions that the subject
inspires.'' He added: ``One's philosophy, one's experiences, one's
exposure to the raw edges of human existence, one's religious
training, one's attitudes toward life and family and their values,
and the moral standards one establishes and seeks to observe, are
all likely to influence and to color one's thinking about
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The opinion, based in part on research that Blackmun conducted
in the Mayo Clinic library during the court's 1972 summer recess,
reviewed social, religious, medical and legal approaches to
abortion going back to ancient times. He concluded that abortion,
at least in early pregnancy, was widely tolerated both under
English common law and at the time of the adoption of the U.S.
Constitution, with legal prohibitions becoming widespread only late
in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   In its constitutional analysis, the opinion noted that the
Constitution does not explicitly mention a right to privacy.
Nonetheless, Blackmun said, the court in a variety of contexts
``has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee
of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The opinion did not locate the right to privacy in a specific
constitutional provision _ a source of much future criticism of Roe
v. Wade _ but concluded that the right ``is broad enough to
encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her
pregnancy.'' A state could interfere with this fundamental right
only for a ``compelling'' reason, Blackmun said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that regulation of abortion served two ``important state
interests,'' the protection both of women's health and ``the
potentiality of human life.'' These two interests were ``separate
and distinct,'' Blackmun said, adding that ``each grows in
substantiality as the woman approaches term and, at a point during
pregnancy, each becomes `compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's interest in regulating abortion for the sake of a
pregnant woman's health could not be compelling during the first
three months of pregnancy, Blackmun said, because abortions during
this period caused fewer deaths than full-term pregnancy and
eventual childbirth. After the first trimester, a state ``may
regulate the abortion procedure to the extent that the regulation
reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal
health,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion then addressed, in what was to prove its most
controversial portion, the argument that the state's interest in
protecting potential life was a ``compelling'' one that justified
prohibiting abortion completely.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas had argued that life begins at conception, Blackmun
said that ``We need not resolve the difficult question of when life
begins.'' He said: ``When those trained in the respective
disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to
arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the
development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate
as to the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun said that the state's interest in protecting potential
life became ``compelling'' only at the point of fetal viability,
the period after which a fetus is ``potentially able to live
outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid.'' Citing
obstetrical texts, he placed this point at roughly from 24 to 28
weeks of pregnancy. He said that state regulation designed to
protect a viable fetus ``has both logical and biological
justifications.'' Roe v. Wade permitted states to prohibit abortion
after the point of viability ``except when necessary to preserve
the life or health of the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   For the remainder of his career, Blackmun regarded Roe v. Wade
with pride and a fierce attachment. ``If it goes down the drain,''
he told a group of law students in 1986, ``I'd still like to regard
Roe v. Wade as a landmark in the progress of the emancipation of
women.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he retired at the age of 85, Blackmun was the
third-oldest person ever to serve on the court. Only Justice Oliver
Wendell Holmes, who retired at age 90, and Chief Justice Roger B.
Taney, who died in office at 87, were older.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the numbers are, and it's time,'' Blackmun said as
he stood with Clinton at a White House press conference on April 6,
1994. The president praised him warmly. ``Justice has not only been
his title, it has been his guiding light,'' Clinton said.

MITSUBISHI BOOSTS BOTTOM LINE WITH SALE OF PLANT TO CANON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Mitsubishi Motors Corp. became the latest big
Japanese company to shrink its excess factory capacity Thursday,
announcing a deal to sell a plant that makes truck transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   The auto manufacturer said it would sell its Maruko plant in
Tokyo to Canon Inc. and the Mitsubishi Corporation by March 25 and
transfer the roughly 500 employees working there and their
equipment to its Kawasaki plant.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Motors said the sale would give it an extraordinary
profit of 25 billion yen, or about $205 million at current exchange
rates, which will help strengthen the company's weak bottom line in
the fiscal year that ends March 31.
</P>
<P>
   The company now projects that it will report a 1 billion yen, or
$8.2 million, loss on a consolidated basis in this fiscal year,
compared with a previous forecast of a 26 billion yen loss.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is home to 11 vehicle manufacturers, which are slugging it
out not only in a domestic industry that can produce between three
million and four million more cars than it can sell but also in an
industry suffering from a global overcapacity.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Nissan Diesel, the struggling truck-making affiliate
of the Nissan Motor Co., announced that it would close a production
line, and the Toyota Motor Corp. is pushing its affiliate, Kanto
Auto Works, to cut capacity by 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Motors, burdened with $2 trillion yen in debt, is
Japan's fifth-largest auto maker.
</P>
<P>
   Katsuhiko Kawasoe, the president of Mitsubishi Motors, has said
repeatedly that he has been shopping bits and pieces of the company
around.

REAL SQUABBLE OVER REAL ESTATE  
 SARA LEE'S ART COLLECTION  
 CONDENSED FUND  
 CHRISTIE'S BY A NOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although he is 91, retirement is not in the cards for
Leo Castelli. On April 17 Castelli, the art dealer, is to open a
new space at 59 East 79th Street, Manhattan, just two blocks from 4
East 77th Street, where he began in 1957. The inaugural exhibition
will be devoted to monotypes by Jasper Johns, one of Castelli's
longtime artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot is happening on the Upper East Side again,'' said
Barbara Castelli, Castelli's wife, who works with him. ``There are
a lot of other galleries in the neighborhood and hotels where
collectors from all over the world come to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   But where does this leave 420 West Broadway, the SoHo building
where the Castelli gallery has been since the 70s? The five-story
1890s building, just north of Spring Street, has played a major
role in contemporary art for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Castelli has been fighting for two years with the building's
other owners: the art dealers Ileana Sonnabend and Charles Cowles,
the real estate investor Fritz deKnegt and the heirs of Wouter F.
Germans, who died in April and was deKnegt's partner.
</P>
<P>
   DeKnegt and Germans maintained that their 40 percent share of
the cooperative entitled them to lease the first and fourth floors.
They had tried to lease the ground floor to Esprit de Corps, the
San Francisco clothing company. But the three dealers, each of whom
occupies one of the three remaining floors, sued, contending that
the cooperative as a whole had a right to decide on the tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Now Esprit is suing deKnegt and the Germans estate, claiming
they misrepresented their authority to rent out the ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   The dealers have said that they would be willing to sell the
building, but that they did not want to see it transformed into a
shopping mall. Barrington, a Manhattan real estate developer, is
offering to buy the four upper floors, which it would turn into
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Other developers have made approaches, but no deal has been
struck, said Howard B. Adler, a Manhattan lawyer representing Fritz
deKnegt and his business, F&AMP;W Management Co.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Castelli said that until the building was sold, the
Castelli Gallery there would remain open but only for a few hours a
day. Antonio Homem, director of the Sonnabend Gallery, said it was
planning to stay put until the fall, when it hoped to move to West
22d Street in Chelsea. Michael Sweney, director of the Cowles
Gallery, said Cowles had no plans to move before the fate of the
building was decided.
</P>

   Sara Lee's plans to give away much of its prized art collection
to museums around the world _ which in addition to good public
relations also provides a nice tax deduction _ have doubled since
the original announcement in June. The corporation is now giving 52
works to 40 museums.
</P>
<P>
   One the latest recipients is the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,
which has just received Rouault's ``Pierrot'' (1938), one of the
most important of the artist's clown paintings. It is the first
major Rouault to enter the museum's collection.
</P>
<P>
   The museums originally named were in cities where Sara Lee has a
corporate presence. But after deciding to amplify the program, it
has tried to match works to museums whose collections could benefit
from specific gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is organizing a traveling exhibition of the 52 works
before they are scattered. ``Monet to Moore: The Millennium Gift of
Sara Lee Corporation,'' will open at the Singapore Art Museum on
April 1. It will travel to Australia, North Carolina, Oregon and
Illinois.
</P>

<P>
   Smarting from a decrease in donations for acquisition, the
Metropolitan Museum of Art is holding its first dinner to rebuild
its fund for that purpose, a $1,000-a-person gala at the museum on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our dinners have been to benefit our operating
expenses,'' said Philippe de Montebello, the Metropolitan's
director. ``This will replace our traditional spring gala and will
hopefully replenish the funds that have been cruelly depleted by
Reader's Digest.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980s the Lila Acheson Wallace Fund has supported the
Met's operating and acquisitions budgets with dividends it received
on its stock in Reader's Digest Association. (Mrs. Wallace was a
founder, with her husband, of Reader's Digest.)
</P>
<P>
   These dividends were increased in some years, and as recently as
1997 $3.1 million went to the Met for acquisitions. But
shareholders' dividends have been reduced twice since then, and
that has slashed the Wallace Fund's annual contribution to the
museum to a mere $300,000 for acquiring art and objects.
</P>
<P>
   Emily K. Rafferty, the museum's senior vice president for
development and membership, said that this season the museum asked
its chairman's council, a group of about 60 donors who each give
the museum $40,000 a year, to add another $10,000 each specifically
for acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   With this appeal and the money raised from Monday's dinner, Ms.
Rafferty said, the museum hoped to raise about $1 million.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's and Christie's announced their 1998 worldwide auction
sales figures this week, and the two companies are nearly tied.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year Christie's has a tiny edge. Its auction
sales for 1998 totaled $1.96 billion, a 3 percent decline from 1997
when it was $2.01 billion. Sotheby's sales increased 5 percent, to
$1.93 billion, from $1.84 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's became a private company this summer when Francois
Pinault, the French investor, purchased the auction house, so it is
no longer required to release its earnings figures. Sotheby's, a
public company trading on the New York Stock Exchange, must release
its earnings: they rose to $45 million, from $40.6 million in 1997.

IN THE MAGIC REALM OF DRAWINGS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, Canada, France)   By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The secret life of a great art museum is often best
sought out in its department of drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who wants to experience the peculiar spell that
unfamiliar drawings can have upon us need only go to the Frick
Collection, where the current auxiliary exhibition focuses on
``French and English Drawings of the 18th and 19th Centuries From
the National Gallery of Canada.'' The exhibit runs through April
25.
</P>
<P>
   Right from the start, in the small room at street level that
serves both as an overflow and a teaser for shows of this kind,
there are drawings that, coming from no matter what source, would
hold our attention.
</P>
<P>
   The star attraction is the portrait by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec
of his uncle Amedee de Tapie de Celeyran. This was done when
Toulouse-Lautrec was only 19, and it has precision, energy and
bounce in full measure. Uncle Amedee is pinned down like a rare
butterfly on a board.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from it is a large and tender drawing by Renoir of his
wife and her small son, Jean. Renoir was to go much further in the
final painting that resulted, but movie buffs will recognize the
future director of ``The Rules of the Game'' in the baby's head and
profile. Like ``Proud Maisie,'' the pencil portrait of an Edwardian
heartbreaker by Frederick Sandys that dates from 1902, these
drawings would make their mark anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But it is downstairs at the Frick, where we turn to the left for
English drawings and to the right for French ones, that the
character of the Ottawa collection really asserts itself. Among the
national galleries of the world, the one in Ottawa is relatively
young, though not as young (or so prepotent) as the one in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was founded in 1880, under impeccable imperial patronage.
(The head of it was the then governor general of Canada, whose
mother-in-law was Queen Victoria.) Its collection initially
consisted of works by Canadian artists who had been accepted as
members of the Royal Canadian Academy of the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   It took 31 years for the gallery to establish a department of
prints and drawings. Not until 1928 did the gallery hire a young
Englishwoman, Kathleen Fenwick, who had a passion for drawings. It
was to be a further 29 years before she had a substantial say in
what drawings should be bought.
</P>
<P>
   This might have been a recipe for stagnation. But in 1937 the
gallery appointed a British scholar and collector, Paul Oppe, to
work from London as its adviser for drawings. (The quality of
Oppe's own collection of British drawings and watercolors was such
that it was recently acquired from his family by the Tate Gallery
in London for a seven-figure sum in sterling.)
</P>
<P>
   During his 20 years as an adviser to Ottawa, Oppe did his very
best for Canada. The 341 drawings for which he was responsible
included the ``Two Men Standing'' in red chalks by Watteau that may
well be the most beautiful drawing in the French section of the
show.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year as an adviser, he gave a whole new spin to the
notion of English watercolors when he bought a masterpiece by
Samuel Palmer called ``Oak Trees, Lullingstone Park, 1828.'' This
was marvelously exact in its portrait of overhanging oak trees, and
Palmer contrasted them with a flood of egg-yellow light that gave a
new idea of abundant color as a presence in English landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1937, the gallery acquired a formidable Henry Fuseli
drawing of a young giantess seen from the back. Standing up
straight, with her arms stretched wide, she clearly had troubled
Fuseli's dreams. As so often in his work, he took the idea of a
very big young woman and passed her on to us with all her
monumentality intact.
</P>
<P>
   In the study of English townscape, Oppe got away from
traditional motifs when he acquired ``Chimney Sweepers, May Day''
by John Augustin Atkinson, dating from around 1814. Not much is
made of Atkinson in histories of English art, but there is a
magical freedom of color and light in this study of the London boy
chimney sweeps on May Day.
</P>
<P>
   Normally the lowest of the low on the labor market, on May Day
the sweeps wore brilliant blue-and-gold dress costumes and danced
in the streets, and were treated like gentlefolk by people who
normally shrank from their dirty hands.
</P>
<P>
   French drawings were held in honor in Ottawa as early as 1912,
when the gallery acquired the archetypal ``Young Mother Preparing
an Evening Meal'' by J.F. Millet, which is in the Frick show.
(France still ranks, after all, as one of Canada's two founder
nations.) The tradition has, if anything, been reinforced in recent
years. Drawings like ``The Raven'' by Odilon Redon, the sketch for
``The Barque of Dante'' by the then-young Eugene Delacroix, ``The
Black Arm'' by Courbet and the roundel portrait made in prison in
1795 by Jacques-Louis David are all important way stations in the
long history of French art.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ``Return of the Traveler'' by Jean-Baptiste Greuze,
it is one of the most powerful of Greuze's many investigations into
the melodrama of French family life. The mix of physical and
emotional distress could not be more vividly conveyed.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite extreme of size, weight and evident hard labor
is the drawing of the Piazzetta in Venice by Richard Parkes
Bonington. Delacroix, when young, loved and admired Bonington, and
the two friends both contribute a great deal to this show.
Delacroix's ``Crucifixion'' in pastel measures no more than 9
inches by 4, but it has a flamelike luminosity that makes its
impact even from far across the room.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bonington's Venetian drawing, it is as fresh and as
brilliant as if it had been done this afternoon instead of 175
years ago. All Venice is there: the light, the marine air, the
great monuments and the people, both native and foreign. It stands
out even in a show where much is irresistible.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul Taylor's recent dance works have tended to be
very funny or very nasty, sometimes both. His new and beautiful
``Fiddlers Green'' reminds us that the essential Paul Taylor is the
one who hears music and choreographs to it.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, that is what Taylor always does, and there is
nothing simple about the way he hears music. His plotless pieces
show him off as the most musical choreographer in modern dance. For
starters, one can name ``Aureole,'' ``Airs,'' ``Mercuric Tidings,''
``Arden Court'' and ``Esplanade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiddlers Green,'' given its New York premiere by the Paul
Taylor Dance Company on Wednesday night at City Center, is a
pastoral dance. The score consists of excerpts from ``John's Book
of Alleged Dances'' by the contemporary composer John Adams, whose
treatment of American folk motifs is obviously Taylor's
springboard.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 1962 ``Aureole,'' the new work is lyrical and
sprightly, haunting in its formal composition. ``Fiddlers Green''
is not the son of ``Aureole'' but perhaps the grand nephew of that
masterwork, which was long Taylor's signature piece.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers are again in white costumes, this time in Santo
Loquasto's Tom Sawyer overalls and shirts for the men and very
short dresses for the women. A male solo and a tender male-female
duet stand out in relief within the ensemble as they do in
``Aureole.''
</P>
<P>
   But Adams, not quite out of his post-Minimalist phase, is not
the Handel of ``Aureole.'' Taylor's great plotless pieces have been
set to music by 18th- and 19th-century composers.
</P>
<P>
   In Adams, he finds an American do-it-yourself inventiveness
similar to his own, and ``Fiddlers Green'' succeeds on a level of
immediacy. It does not have a soaring grandeur but its purity
recalls why ``Aureole'' was originally called Taylor's ``White
Ballet'' (a reference to the corps in white of ``Giselle'' and
other 19th-century ballets).
</P>
<P>
   The first of six sections opens with Patrick Corbin tapping his
foot as Jennifer Tipton's lighting renders the backdrop all green.
In this instant abstraction of small town America with its village
greens, Taylor and Ms. Tipton wittily recall a more bucolic time
when towns did not yet establish drug-free zones around their
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Kronos Quartet, which commissioned the score, is heard on a
recording. The strings, especially the violin playing, make up the
avant-garde fiddling. Adams also used a prepared piano (objects in
the piano strings to create rhythmic support). No wonder foot
tapping is the choreographic motif.
</P>
<P>
   The other dancers join Corbin as the happy-go-lucky hero. Their
movement is light, full of Taylorisms: curved arms in attitude
jumps, pelvis swivels, rotating shoulders and torso, rhythmic
shifts and fast skips with arms in flattened position, palms held
out.
</P>
<P>
   All sit and watch Richard Chen See, always his remarkable self
in a remarkably fast solo in which his elbows spin like juggling
pins when he is not walking like a chicken or pawing the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's attention is always to detail in movement, and the way
he offers a twist on other idioms, as well as on his own, sets the
tone in each segment. The third, danced by Lisa Viola, Kristi
Egtvedt, Silvia Nevjinsky, Andy LeBeau, Takehiro Ueyama and Maureen
Mansfield, begins with a wedge of hip-swaying dancers who look
dreamy and then communal as they form a cluster.
</P>
<P>
   This is the pastoral heart of the dance, very neat in its
symmetry of pairs, who are always on the move. The sweet violin
sounds give way to a thump for Ms. Viola's heel-clicking before the
cast forms a tighter circle and ends in a pose, arms curved.
</P>
<P>
   The major solo goes to Corbin, typically fast on his feet and
brilliant as a thigh-slapping hayseed. The choreography is a
difficult collage of unrelated steps, mainly jumps that change
shape in the air. Ueyama enters to copy Corbin, who chases him out
several times and never stops what is basically a continuous solo
that only looks like a duet.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Patrick and Rachel Berman are magnificent in a superb and
sensual duet. Patrick carries Ms. Berman before she slips to the
floor to recline like a latter-day Odalisque. The music, a slow
melody heard over little plunks, gives the beauty of the unfolding
choreography a complementary flow.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick is the protective, enraptured partner as he and Ms.
Berman explore a relationship: she puts her leg on his shoulder and
cartwheels, and both propel themselves on the floor in a half-lying
position. All is seamless.
</P>
<P>
   The finale has a punch line that doesn't quite work: Ueyama
chases Corbin, the town bully, offstage, and the piece ends with
Ueyama raising his fist in a power salute. But before that moment,
the full cast returns for a recapitulation of all the hip-slapping,
foot-tapping and heel-clicking. Not light, not dark, ``Fiddlers
Green'' is dancing to music.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Berest, Andrew Asnes, Ted Thomas, Michael Trusnovec,
Francie Huber and Caryn Heilman joined the other hard-working
dancers in ``Cloven Kingdom,'' which suffered from a glitch in the
lighting and sound system. The energy was there, but something was
missing in Taylor's reminder that under their elegant evening
dress, people can be positively beastly.
</P>
<P>
   Superlatives cannot suffice for the more recent ``Piazzolla
Caldera,'' a technical tour de force and essay on the tango. Taylor
captures the essence of that dance by filtering the music of Astor
Piazzolla and Jerzy Peterburshsky. Asnes' power was unmistakable;
Patrick and See, as a couple of drunks, gave the gymnastic
choreography their all. Ms. Huber was persuasive as the loner in
the crowd, and Corbin and Ms. Viola yanked and pulled with passion.

   PHOENIX - `I felt dirty and I felt used,'' Monica Lewinsky told
an estimated 70 million television viewers Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   To which we reply: You are, and you were. So what's your point?
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans say they are sick and tired of the media's
obsession with President Clinton's sexual escapades and wish that
the country would focus on issues that matter - Social Security,
health care, foreign policy, education. But there's a disconnect
between what Americans say and what they do.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that 70 million Americans would tune into a two-hour
interview with a young woman of questionable intelligence and even
more questionable (non-existent?) morals indicates that Americans
aren't at all sick and tired of the topic.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been the most-watched news program ever broadcast by
a single network. Indeed, if Lewinsky's new book, written with
Andrew Morton of Princess Di fame, becomes a best seller, Americans
will have nobody but themselves to blame for the country's
obsession with the Monica Mess.
</P>
<P>
   None of which absolves Clinton of responsibility. This president
demonstrated appallingly bad judgment - not once, but many times.
And he lied about it. Not once, but many times.
</P>
<P>
   Including to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's accused of rape.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's wrongdoing will become his legacy. Saddest of all, it
does irreparable harm to the country he claims to love.
</P>
<P>
   After viewing ABC's Lewinsky special, some described Monica as
more vixen than victim. We agree. It's a distinction worth
remembering.

PICASSO`S CERAMICS: GENIUS ON HOLIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Exhibition notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You should have fun with the exhibition of Picasso's
ceramic work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Picasso certainly
seems to have enjoyed carving this particular notch in his cane of
art medium conquests. That he did so during one of the happiest
periods of his life may partly account for the unclouded lightness
of these charming figures, wittily decorated plates, casseroles,
pitchers, masks and glazed-tile paintings. Perhaps the second-class
status traditionally accorded ceramics had a soporific effect,
contributing to the air of genius on holiday, veering in and out of
focus, that permeates this show.
</P>
<P>
   The best pieces are utterly transparent. They reduce Picasso's
transforming genius to its most basic, accessible components;
present his favorite subjects in a medium that seems to fuse
painting, sculpture and drawing into a single, fluid process, and
reveal another side of his easy familiarity with different artistic
periods and styles. The less successful works parody those styles
to the brink of kitsch and confirm the careless bravado that
Picasso could almost always summon: Even on automatic pilot he
produced things that were at least Picassos and sometimes only
that. And they reiterate his reflexive obsession with the female
form. When is a vessel just a vessel? Almost never.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1940s, Picasso was withdrawing from the pressures of
Paris and spending more and more time in the south of France,
enjoying a brief period of family life with his young mistress,
Francoise Gilot. In 1947 they had a son, Claude, and in 1949, a
daughter, Paloma. Also in 1947, Picasso began to work at Madoura,
the pottery factory of Georges and Suzanne Ramie in Vallauris, near
Antibes. Blessed with ground that yielded excellent clay, Vallauris
had been an important ceramics-producing center from Roman times to
the 1920s, when metal cooking vessels began to replace the
traditional earthenware. The Ramies extended the invitation to
Picasso partly in the hope that his presence would help revive the
town's depressed economy, which it did.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Picasso was spending his summers and more and more of his
winters in a villa above Vallauris, renting an old perfume factory
there as a sculpture studio and, for a decade, even producing
linoleum-cut posters for the town's small summer ceramics festival.
(They line the reading room in the Met exhibition and have the same
offhand liveliness as the ceramics.) His involvement with ceramics,
which was most intense during the late 1940s, eventually resulted
in more than 3,000 objects that form the only patch of terra
incognita remaining on the well-charted continent of his art.
</P>
<P>
   It is noteworthy that after his death, every art object in his
estate was photographed except the ceramic works, which he owned in
abundance. First exhibited around 1950, they were dismissed by
influential potters like Bernard Leach in England and viewed with
embarrassment by the art world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picasso: Painter and Sculptor in Clay'' affords the first
in-depth look at Picasso's ceramics and avoids burdening them with
undue claims. It was seen last fall at the Royal Academy in London,
where it was organized by a curatorial team that included Claude
Picasso and Bernard Ruiz-Picasso, the artist's son and grandson;
Norman Rosenthal and Simonetta Fraquelli of the Royal Academy, and
Marilyn McCully, a London-based Picasso scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Showcased in the exhibition's opening gallery are works that
hint at the range of style, form and subject to come, as well as
some of the ups and downs. On view are a large pitcher painted with
robust flowers and a serpent in ultramarine and black; a tall,
curving vase that Picasso converted into a female torso by adding a
bright yellow bikini so crisply Minimal it might have been painted
by Alex Katz; a jolly mask that suggests some kind of high-class
touristware, and a bright green plate presenting a ceramic fish,
fork and lemon slice, a cliche worn thin by the Surrealists and
later thinner still by Robert Arneson.
</P>
<P>
   Also here is a bare-to-the-waist draped figure, a little Venus
de Milo with arms. And of course there is the artist himself, shown
in Attic-style black silhouette on a green and white pitcher,
painting and (on the other side) sculpturing from the nude model.
In one of the show's better moments of tossed-off brilliance, the
throat of the pitcher doubles as clerestory studio windows through
which birds and treetops are visible. Such depictive finesse
becomes overbearing later in the show, in a group of elliptical
platters and small bowls whose curves re-create that most macho of
Picasso motifs, the bullring, with almost cloying accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The show has been beautifully installed by William Lieberman,
the chairman of 20th-century art at the Met and a veteran of many
Picasso shows. Happily, nearly everything can be seen in the round.
Unhappily, some interesting pieces were not lent to the New York
stop, including some early dabblings in ceramics dating from the
late 1920s, in which Picasso painted images onto vases made by Jean
van Dongen, the brother of the painter Kees van Dongen. Other works
were simply trimmed from the show, among them a singularly rugged
hybrid sculpture (1950-51) that consists of an earthenware vase
embedded in a larger, cruder pitcher made of cast plaster.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Picasso merely added glazed images and decorations to
traditional plates thrown on the wheel by the potters at Madoura.
Or he cleverly reshaped vases fresh off the potter's wheel, adding
a few dents, dots, dashes and wavy black lines to create a woman in
a billowing Fortuny-like gown, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But he also began designing zoomorphic pieces, made of
combinations of thrown forms that were often innovative departures
from ancient jugs and amphorae. These include the reclining kid
goat in the show's second gallery, and the man and woman mounted on
a bull and a horse. The extended necks of these vessels, with
curving arms attached, double as the human figures in these
ambitious works. The images of these animals are split and splayed
ingeniously onto tilted bullet-shaped volumes, one more round in
the continual contest between two- and three-dimensional forms that
began with the two-eyed profiles of ``Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.''

 NEW YORK: Demoiselles d'Avignon.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And naturally, Picasso began to rove through history, creating
amusing fragments that parody the black and red vases of Classical
Greece or depict arcadian fauns and flute players who began to
re-enter his art in the 1920s. Most convincing in this category are
the regal women inspired by Hellenic Tanagra figures, who are shown
draped in patterned robes.
</P>
<P>
   The rims of certain plates have wonderful details, even when
their central images fail to impress: decorative borders suggestive
of French peasant pottery, or colored confetti that seems lifted
from his own pointillist-flavored Cubist works of the late teens.
And of course there are images of Francoise: On one plate she's
depicted sentimentally as a doe-eyed beauty, on its neighbor in
crude childish scribbles of red and blue punctuated by a
sharp-pointed nose. Next to this, her face appears again, this time
carved into a mask with powerful volumes and startled eyes. After
1955, there are portraits of Jacqueline Roche, the saleswoman
Picasso met in the Remies' workshop, who became his companion and,
in 1961, his wife.
</P>
<P>
   While not overburdening Picasso's ceramics with claims of
greatness, the exhibition and its catalog, which includes essays by
Claude Picasso, Bernard Ruiz-Picasso and Ms. McCully, also stops
short of putting them in an appropriate historical context. But
that's fine for now. This show opens new territory. A land-rush of
research homesteaders will undoubtedly follow.
</P>
<P>
   One hopes that future scholars will reintegrate Picasso's
ceramics into his work as a whole and consider it in relation to
the work of his contemporaries in the fields of both art and craft.
Some of the ceramic pieces were cast in bronze, but only one
example is included here, the gracefully streamlined ``Centaur,''
from 1947-48, who carries a tiny water jug on his back.
</P>
<P>
   How do Picasso's efforts in clay compare with Matisse's sojourn
in the applied arts, which resulted in the chapel at nearby Vence?
And what was their effect on ceramic art? Despite Bernard Leach's
dismissal, a new book on 20th-century English craft by Tanya Harrod
states that in the early 1950s, a younger generation of English
potters found Picasso's ceramics liberating in their improvisatory
high-spiritedness, their modernity and their disdain of function,
qualities that provided alternatives to Leach's emphasis on Asian
ceramic traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Most interesting of all will be a consideration of their
relationship to the work from Picasso's last decade, when his
involvement with ceramics decreased and he turned to painting and
printmaking, often working in bouts of feverish productivity.
Lieberman has included two of Picasso's late paintings from the
Met's collection in the exhibition's final gallery, creating a
fascinating coda. Their blending colors and fluid forms could well
have been influenced by both the unpredictable melting of glazes in
the Madoura kilns and the abandon with which Picasso applied them.
It is interesting to think that these untroubled ceramic pieces,
intimating a pastoral idyll beneath an eternal Mediterranean sun,
might have helped set the stage for the desperate turmoil of the
late paintings, which often convey a portrait of the artist staring
death in the face and working against the clock.

   JIMI HENDRIX/``LIVE AT THE FILLMORE EAST'' (Experience
Hendrix/MCA) and ``LIVE AT THE OAKLAND COLISEUM'' (Dagger)
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 years after his death, Hendrix's guitar work, singing
and songwriting still sound as fresh and exciting as they did in
the patchouli-scented days of the bell-bottom era. Now that the
Hendrix family has control of the catalog, previously unheard
material has been seeping out. The double-CD ``Live at the Fillmore
East'' (4 stars), drawn from the guitarist's four shows with the
funk-tinged Band of Gypsys around New Year's Eve 1969, contains 16
tracks, 13 of which are issued here for the first time. Best of all
are burning performances of ``Earth Blues,'' ``Izabella'' and
``Stone Free,'' plus two takes of the jaw-dropping ``Machine Gun,''
a Vietnam war commentary delivered by six Fender strings and a
Marshall stack that can still cause shivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live at the Oakland Coliseum'' is the debut release of Dagger
Records, a label established by the Hendrix family to offer
inspired performances that don't meet the standards of the MCA
releases. Call this limited-edition two-disc set, available by mail
order and through the Experience Hendrix Web site, an official
bootleg. Taped by an audience member with a single microphone in
April 1969, the night after a Hendrix date at the Forum, the superb
``Oakland'' (3 1/2 stars) is capped by an 18-minute ``Voodoo
Child'' in which Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady joins the
trio on stage. Equally fine is an extended version of Hendrix's
greatest blues, ``Red House.''

EMINEM/``THE SLIM SHADY LP'' (Aftermath/Interscope)
</P>
<P>
   Warped, vulgar, demented and offensive _ those are the
adjectives white Detroit rapper Eminem's label uses to market this
much-publicized debut disc. With savvy hip-hop producer Dr. Dre at
the helm and MTV giving it the big push backed by Interscope's
well-known muscle, look for ``Slim Shady'' to top the charts in a
few short weeks. Aimed squarely at suburban teens destined to lap
up Eminem's lyrical assault, the album is sort of enjoyable in a
cartoony ``South Park'' way upon first listen. However, it's hard
to imagine many return visits to this vulgar and demented landscape
where there's at least truth in advertising. 2 stars

ART BLAKEY/``ART BLAKEY'S JAZZ MESSENGERS WITH THELONIOUS MONK''
(Rhino/Atlantic)
</P>
<P>
   This is the second wave of deluxe jazz reissues from Rhino that
expertly mine the classic recordings made in the late '50s and
early '60s for Atlantic. Each comes complete with an informative,
colorful booklet (with original liner notes, new essays and color
photos) and a CD sleeve featuring the album's original art. The
first-rate packaging perfectly complements the music, which ranks
among the greatest jazz ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The Mingus albums couldn't be more different. ``The Clown'' ()
features the classic ``Haitian Fight Song,'' as well as Jean
Shepherd's improvisational story reading on the title track. Mingus
limits himself to piano and some enthusiastic shouting on ``Oh
Yeah'' (4 stars), giving the spotlight to Roland Kirk, who plays
the flute, siren, tenor sax, manzello and stritch. The passionate,
emotional music _ all originals _ is among Mingus' compositional
best work. Both albums also add stellar bonus tracks from the
period, making them a must for collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coltrane's Sound'' (4 stars), recorded the same week as the
more famous ``My Favorite Things,'' doesn't receive as much acclaim
as the latter work. One listen, though, and you realize that this
is a fantastic album and on par with any of the the saxophonist's
recordings on Atlantic. It contains the beautiful ``Central Park
West'' and bluesy ``Equinox,'' as well as two revealing takes of
Coleman Hawkins' ``Body and Soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blakey-Monk collaboration (4 stars) features several famous
Monk compositions (``Evidence,'' ``Blue Monk,'' ``I Mean You'') as
well as an original from tenor sax man Johnny Griffin (``Purple
Shades''). Griffin is an essential part of this recording, which is
a shining example of musicians adapting their individual styles to
create a cohesive, committed whole.

of the many pleasant surprises to be found in this effort to get
back to basics: live Grateful Dead, played by surviving members and
close friends. With bassist Phil Lesh the strongest element of this
reincarnation, and a strong pinch of Bruce Hornsby thrown in, the
results offer a fresh look at such oddly touching throwbacks as
``Mountains of the Moon,'' ``St. Stephen'' and ``The Eleven.'' For
Deadheads, the remarkable force of the Other Ones provides
reassurance. 3 1/2 stars &QL; 
_ Brett Pauly &QL; 
 &QL;

JOE HENRY/``FUSE'' (Mammoth)
</P>
<P>
   Here's a slinky, grown-up soundtrack for late-night musings on
the nature of love and life. Think world-famous depressive Mark
Eitzel on a good day. Henry's ``Monkey'' and ``Want Too Much'' have
received some airplay in odd corners of the radio dial, for good
reason. The singer boasts a smokey, world-weary voice that fits his
sophisticated musical backdrop like an olive in a desert-dry
martini. And like that martini, ``Fuse,'' due Tuesday, is a
refreshing and grown-up libation for the ears. 3 stars

GONE _ BUT NOT FORGOTTEN _ AT R&AMP;B PIONEER AWARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``It's gotten to the point where every single day
something of value is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer and band leader Paul Westerberg, who made that comment
over the phone the other day, has a point, especially in a
transitory city like Los Angeles where a historical landmark is a
car wash that has stood on the same site for three years.
</P>
<P>
   In the music biz, revered artists of yesterday are routinely
discarded, shunted aside and forgotten, except by the collectors
and staunch fans who've stood by during the hard times.
</P>
<P>
   That's what was so touching about the recent Pioneer Awards
ceremony in which the Rhythm-and-Blues Foundation honored 10 soul
greats in an elaborate dinner the day after the Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   For some, like New Orleans r&AMP;b and jazz crooner Johnny Adams, it
was too late. Adams, who died last year, was represented by his
widow, Judy Adams, who insisted that unfair record contracts were
still in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny put out nine albums since 1984, and we haven't seen a
penny from any of them,'' she said. ``If he hadn't kept touring the
way he did, I don't know how we'd eat. This was slavery dressed up
in a suit.''
</P>
<P>
   The day of the Pioneer event, honorees including Joe Simon,
Mickey Baker, Brenda Holloway, Garnet Mimms and the Manhattans
gathered at a West Hollywood hotel to renew old friendships, meet
invited guests and give interviews.
</P>
<P>
   It was indeed heartwarming to see longtime fans who've turned
into friends approach artists such as Holloway to catch up on old
times. A British documentary crew shot the proceedings for a film
on the UK phenomenon known as Northern Soul, in which discos in
desolate places like Wigan and Blackpool turned obscure r&AMP;b singles
into a lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The Pioneer Awards _ not the relatively hollow Grammys _ are the
industry's true best night each year, the latter more often than
not rewarding sales and marketing success over genuine musical
achievement.

   The performance segment of the r&AMP;b event should be televised

FROM CENTRAL ASIA EXOTIC TEXTILES AS TROPHY CLOTHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The most appealing exotica produced in backwater
Central Asia during the 19th century _ as far from Paris as you
could get, fashionwise _ were the gorgeously colored and patterned
handmade silks known as ikat. Made by the complex ``resist''
method, which entails repeated binding and dying of the threads
before they are woven into fabric, ikat goes back to ancient times
and is known to many cultures throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Asian ikat revival that came and went in the last
century involved not only many intricate processes but _ talk about
multicultural! _ a rich mix of ethnic types who cooperated in
carrying them out: Tajiks, Uzbeks, Iranians and Jews, among others,
each a specialist in dying, weaving or another aspect of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Imbued, like their clientele, with the Central Asian passion for
textiles, they made ikats for sale as luxury goods and worked them
into presentation and ceremonial robes. In Bukhara and Samarkand,
along with smaller outposts in this desert-and-steppe segment of
the old silk route, your social status was judged by the number and
quality of ikats you wore and hung on your walls, and a bride's
dowry was nothing without them.
</P>
<P>
   Of the several fine Central Asian ikat collections in the West,
the most comprehensive is said to be that of Dr. Guido Goldman, a
political scientist and founding director of the Minda de Gunzberg
Center for European Studies at Harvard. Inspired by their parallels
with 20th-century abstract art, Goldman has been acquiring the
sumptuous silks for more than 20 years and refers to them as
textile paintings.
</P>
<P>
   From his holdings of more than 200 ikats (the word is derived
from mengikat, a Malay-Indonesian verb meaning to tie or to bind),
40 form the show at the Jewish Museum, ``Ikat: Splendid Silks of
Central Asia From the Guido Goldman Collection.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance the exhibition, circulated by the American
Foundation for Textile Art Inc., is overwhelming, a dizzying blitz
of rug-bazaar color and pattern that to Western eyes might seem a
little over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as noted in the handsome catalog written by two Central
Asian textile specialists, Katherine Fitz Gibbon and Andrew Hale,
the ikats clearly exemplify the conventions of Central Asian art:
``abstraction from nature, clear and defined color, vigorous line,
a love of pattern and, above all, a willingness to play around, to
try a new pattern with every warp.'' And pretty soon, in the
sensuous chromatic climate created by these objects, your guard
drops and your eye tunes up.
</P>
<P>
   Wall hangings, made of several same-patterned vertical fabric
lengths sewn together, predominate in the show. One of the most
striking is a rare, luxurious five-panel piece from Bukhara (in
Uzbekistan), dating to the first half of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Incorporating no less than eight colors (which meant eight dye
baths), it is a dazzling orchestration of highly stylized scorpion
motifs keyed in with lozenges of floral and jewelry designs. The
predominating reds are inflected by yellows, blues and greens, all
on an underlying white field.
</P>
<P>
   In another Bukharan wall hanging from the same period, rife with
warm reds and mustard yellows, the designer ``plays around'' by
mixing bunches of stylized pomegranates hanging from stalks with
the shapes of paired water jugs, like accidentally placed fruits,
to show his skill at sketching out a complex pattern on the bound
threads.
</P>
<P>
   Ikat designers didn't worry about such trifling Western concerns
as matching patterns or aligning them when panels were sewn
together. They assumed, in fact, that misalignment heightened the
visual buzz, and for the same reason they often used different
patterns in the same hanging.
</P>
<P>
   One mid-19th-century piece from Bukhara, for example, whose
central design is of pinched-in hexagonal medallions in red, black
and white, is surrounded by a ``frame'' of entirely different cat's
face motifs, smaller in scale but of similar colors. A deliberate
misalignment can clearly be seen in another Bukharan hanging from
the same period, a work whose involved design evokes the
intricacies of Central Asian architecture.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Predominantly colored in red, white and black, its forms are
part of a very large medallion whose full shape can barely be
perceived within the fabric length.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ikats shown here are slightly more restrained. One
elegant hanging from the mid-19th century has a somber indigo
background, considered more appropriate for older women and funeral
clothes. It is figured with a dignified motif of white pendantlike
scrolls, inflected by long red free-form streaks. And there are
some simpler patterns much closer to Western abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   A single panel loom length, also from Bukhara but later in the
century, has a vertical animal skin motif, like a tiger's stripes,
in blue touched by red and bisected by a narrow white band down the
middle. It was probably influenced by a culture outside Central
Asia, maybe Russian or Far Eastern.
</P>
<P>
   More intricate but still close to Western design is an unusual
silk-velvet Bukharan hanging from the mid-19th century. Its dark
ground, timidly punctuated by small geometric solids in yellows,
reds and blues, is punched up by elongated diamonds and triangles,
outlined in tiny ziggurat steps, that seem to float in a linear
overlay.
</P>
<P>
   From Samarkand or the Fergana Valley, the area closest to China,
is another striking work whose regular, vertical arrangements of
combs between stylized branching steer horns, in arresting colors
on a pale ground, seem to have more in common with 20th-century
Western abstraction than mid-19th-century Central Asian esthetics.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be overlooked are the ikat robes whose distinctive,
stylized shapes counterpoint the many rectangular hangings in the
show. The chapan or khalat, a unisex outer coat of lightly padded
silk or cotton, was the everyday garment of Central Asia. Several
were usually worn on top of each other, conferring a uniform
chubbiness on the populace. Bukharan fops showing off their wealth
sometimes sported up to 10 robes at a time.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also robes made specifically for women. Young
ones wore the brightest colors and the biggest patterns; soberer
dress was assumed by middle-aged and older women. The most
luxurious women's garment was the munisak, worn by Muslim and
Jewish women during important rites of passage, and particularly
evident at their weddings and funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Like the boldly patterned late-19th-century silk-velvet examples
in the show, the garment had accentuated feminine lines with no
collar and flaring sides, although its silhouette was slimmer and
more elegant than other types of women's robes. Well-dressed
matrons of Bukhara and Samarkand would have laughed at staid
Western notions of coordinated colors and patterns; their idea of
high style was a riotous combo of bright calicos, chintzes and
ikats worn all together.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, coinciding with the collapse of the oasis kingdoms
by the end of the 19th century, commercial methods of production
began to invade the trade, and 20th-century dress modes crept in.
Handmade ikats became a thing of the past. Alas! This show can only
hint at what the Western world missed out on.

GRAND CANYON NEEDS FIRE EXPERIMENT  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARS IN THE MARCH 5 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Imagine the unthinkable: A hot, roaring fire out of
control, jumping from treetop to treetop, destroying the old growth
Ponderosa pines that stand proud and tall in Grand Canyon National
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to think the unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   But the harsh truth is that the forests at Grand Canyon are
disasters waiting to happen. More than a century of forest fire
suppression tactics have contributed to a situation ripe for a
repeat of the 1988 fire in Yellowstone National Park that burned
800,000 acres of forest.
</P>
<P>
   Across the canyon rim thick stands of sapling ponderosa pines
are common. There are thick layers of pine needle duff. Dead and
downed trees are everywhere. Factor in one of the driest winters in
a long time and the concern is palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Says an environmental assessment by the National Park Service,
``The potential for large, high-intensity, stand replacing fires in
the 21st century is very likely. The timely treatment of forest
duff and unnaturally dense stands of young trees is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   To lessen the possibility of catastrophic fires and return the
forests to a healthier ecosystem, Grand Canyon officials want to
conduct a series of experiments on two, 80-acre sections _ one on
the South Rim and one on the North Rim.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments have the backing of Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt, who strongly rejects insinuations that the experiments
would be tantamount to the beginning of logging in the nation's
national parks. ``This experiment is an attempt to learn how to
return the forests to their natural, healthy state and eliminate
the danger of catastrophic forest fires,'' he says. ``That's all it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   One suggested model was pioneered by Wally Covington, a
professor of forest ecology at Northern Arizona University. His
view of the natural state of the forests in the Southwest more than
a century ago is a far cry from what we see today. To Covington,
there was large spacing between the tall Ponderosa pines. Tall
grasses grew on the forest's floors. Lightening would ignite the
grasses. These fires consumed the smaller trees and moved past the
fire-resistant bark of the old growth.
</P>
<P>
   We believe the experiments ought to go forward. Each site would
be divided into four, 20-arce experimental units. A different
technique will be used in each: 1) burn only; 2) minimal thinning
and then burning; 3) emulate presettlement forest structure
followed by burning; and 4) control, or no treatment.
</P>
<P>
   These are not a slippery slope to full-scale logging in our
national parks. The public wouldn't stand for such a thing. Rather,
they are designed to produce credible scientific information which
then can be used in the formulation of policy. If they lead to a
environmentally sensitive way to lessen the threat of a catastrophe
and restore forest ecosystems, what's wrong with that? &QL;

JUDGE SAYS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH IN CONVICTED RAPIST'S PAPERWORK

<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ After Patrick C. Lynn was convicted of
raping an Overland Park woman, he vowed in court to ``dedicate my
life to getting even.''
</P>
<P>
   True to his word, he has spent the past two years waging a legal
assault from his prison cell, firing off legal pleadings to
courthouses across eastern Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The scope and tenacity of Lynn's legal efforts have prompted
unprecedented legal rulings against him.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Johnson County judge who has borne the brunt of
much of Lynn's legal wrath issued an order prohibiting Lynn, 42,
from pursuing lawsuits against a dozen people associated with his
case.
</P>
<P>
   Administrative Judge Larry McClain said Lynn's lawsuits were an
effort to ``retaliate against virtually everyone who was involved
in the criminal process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is now attempting to vent his predatory instincts through
the judicial system to attack those involved in his conviction,''
McClain wrote. ``The judicial system should not allow this to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   McClain ordered the court clerk to accept nothing further from
Lynn except notice that he will appeal Monday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn already has filed 10 cases with the Kansas Court of Appeals
and the state Supreme Court, naming McClain in four of them.
</P>
<P>
   He also has filed eight actions in U.S. District Court in
Topeka, but a federal judge threw those cases out and ordered Lynn
to pay several hundred dollars in costs.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn began filing lawsuits shortly after he was sentenced to 88
years in prison in January 1997 in the attack on the Overland Park
woman. He did the same in South Carolina, where he was convicted of
rape and spent 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 30 persons were sued in seven lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   All, he contended, were involved in some type of conspiracy to
violate his rights or frame him for a crime he didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the Kansas attorney general's office, McClain
set temporary restrictions on how Lynn could proceed with his
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami County judge was appointed to hear the case and issued a
permanent injunction requiring all of Lynn's claims to be reviewed
to see whether they had any merit before they could be filed.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Court of Appeals is now considering Lynn's appeal of
that injunction as well as of his criminal conviction.
</P>
<P>
   McClain's ruling Monday was based on his review of lawsuits Lynn
has tried to file against the Overland Park woman, a woman he
dated, an Overland Park officer, the district attorney and seven
lawyers or their employees who had represented him.
</P>
<P>
   While calling Lynn's claims against his victim ``frankly
absurd,'' McClain had the strongest response to Lynn's attempt to
sue his former friend.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was best described ``as fantasized rambling of a
convicted rapist making a malicious attempt to embarrass and
humiliate an innocent witness and former friend.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did before his trial, Lynn fired the first two attorneys
appointed to represent him on the appeal, and he is trying to fire
Geary Gorup, the third attorney to represent him on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Gorup sought to have a mental examination for Lynn.
His motion notes the kinds of demands Lynn makes on his attorneys.
Besides the more than 1,100 pages of the official appeal record,
Lynn has produced more than 2,000 pages of ``pleadings, memorandums
and letters.''
</P>
<P>
   In his writings, Lynn has made 469 requests of Gorup and listed
``over 975 separate legal and factual issues and arguments (without
duplication).''
</P>
<P>
   Gorup said that of those approximately 1,450 ``separate issues,
arguments, requests or demands,'' he had found numerous instances
of factual contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   Gorup suggested that a possible reason for Lynn's inconsistency
or his ``seeming self-destructive inability to accept the orders of
the court or the advice of counsel'' may be a sign of mental
incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   But the Court of Appeals denied the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appellant (Lynn) appears lucid and fully aware of the
judicial process, and this court finds no reason to interrupt the
course of his direct appeal for a hearing on this issue,'' Judge G.
Joseph Pierron wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The court also denied Lynn's request to fire Gorup.

   NATIONAL FORECAST  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients for a storm system will come together across the
Middle West Friday. A jet stream disturbance, which was part of the
storm system that lashed the Pacific Northwest Tuesday night, will
merge Friday morning with another Pacific disturbance over the
northern Rockies. The merger will result in broken areas of snow
across parts of Nebraska, the Dakotas, Montana and Wyoming.
Moreover, the merger will provide additional energy for an
important surface low-pressure system to form over eastern
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and a thunderstorms will burgeon Friday across parts of
the western Gulf States and lower Mississippi Valley as the
developing low works in tandem with a high pressure system over
North Carolina to draw increasingly moist air northward from the
Gulf of Mexico. If moisture mounts rapidly over the region, a few
thunderstorms with damaging winds are possible Friday afternoon and
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Steady rains will fall across the Ohio Valley north of the warm
front associated with the low, with rain changing to snow later as
colder air arrives once the low passes. Farther north, broken areas
of snow will develop over the southern Great Lakes, with
accumulations of 2 to 5 inches of snow possible by Saturday morning
across northern Illinois, southern Wisconsin and eastern Iowa.
Light snow will spread into western Pennsylvania and western New
York Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Pacific Northwest, recently battered by high
winds and heavy rains, will have a respite of tranquil weather.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Fried Electronics
</P>
<P>
   ``The upper-air system got fried by a lightning strike''
reported a forecaster at the National Weather Service in New York
City Wednesday evening. The forecaster was referring to the
electronic system that tracks weather balloons launched from Long
Island. The thunderstorm that zapped the electronics was one of a
bevy that invaded the Northeast states late Wednesday. Some
produced rain, while others produced snow. Winter thunderstorms
associated with a low pressure system indicate the low is rapidly
intensifying, a forecasting clue that can be gleaned without the
aid of a weather balloon.

MONICA BOOK (Phoenix) - People might have flocked to their
televisions to see Monica Lewinsky give a personal account of her
affair with President Clinton, but are they rushing to the
bookstore to buy her memoirs? By JULIE AMPARANO. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PHOENIX TRAFFIC (Phoenix) - An increase in highway travel, which
leads to increased traffic congestion, pushed Phoenix into the top
10 in fatal accidents (16 per 100,000). By CHRISTINA LEONARD. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
UDALL MEMORIAL (Washington) - There was more laughter than tears
when official Washington honored the memory of Mo Udall, who was
praised for having the very qualities that Congress now seems to
lack: humor, grace, and civility. Udall was eulogized by White
House officials, Cabinet secretaries, and the leaders of the House
and Senate. The service was in the same building where he
represented Arizona for 30 years and where his son now serves. By
JEFF BARKER. Story will move in the ``a'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
RIPOFF (Phoenix) - There is the law and then there is justice. In
this case, the law was followed, but was it justice? Several
consumers who bought cars through legitimate Phoenix area
dealerships have been ordered to give them back without
compensation because the cars wound up at those lots via an
auto-theft ring. By PAT FLANNERY. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AMWEST-SPLIT (Phoenix) - Is there a split in the union solidarity?
A flight attendant strike coordinator who resigned Tuesday says
America West was willing to pay the $74.5 million the union is
seeking. She also says the union had agreed that company's offer
was worth $68.7 million, contrary to what leadership said this
week. By PETER CORBETT. Story will move in the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Turns out the Beltway babblers
underestimated her, and so did the rest of us. After 15 months of
constant media coverage, thousands of pages of depositions, X-rated
diaries, taped telephone conversations and a strategically
unlaundered blue dress, we figured the only meaningful revelation
to emerge from the Monica Lewinsky saga had to do with the
significance of dry cleaning. But, no. What Monica Lewinsky has
demonstrated most clearly is the complete insignificance of capital
punishment. By E.J. MONTINI.
</P>
<P>
   Story moved in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EDIT-DRUG WAR (Phoenix) - Critics of the annual certification of
Mexico as a partner in fighting illegal drugs are right to decry
the presidential decree as a ``sham'' and a ``whitewash'' by the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   It is. And it's a shame a federal law makes us do it every year.
</P>
<P>
   More shameful, however, is our own tepid acknowledgement of the
real problem in battling illegal drug use. With a seemingly
insatiable appetite for poison, Americans are the greatest enemy in
this national fight. Story moved in the ``K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
EDIT-LEWINSKY (Phoenix) - ``I felt dirty and I felt used,'' Monica
Lewinsky told an estimated 70 million television viewers Wednesday
night. To which we reply: You are, and you were. So what's your
point?  &QL; 
 &QL; 
EDIT-CANYON-FIRE (Phoenix) - Controlled fire experiments in Grand
Canyon National Park are not a slippery slope to full-scale logging
in our national parks. The public wouldn't stand for such a thing.
Rather, they are designed to produce credible scientific
information which then can be used in the formulation of policy.  &QL;

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Little guys almost always compete with big
guys in American business. But the story takes a different twist in
the world of furniture retailing.
</P>
<P>
   The little guys appear to be winning.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Orman has a theory. With his brother Dennis, Orman opened
Orman's Furniture on Metcalf Avenue in Stanley in southern Overland
Park ``back when we used to say we were just south of 151st and
plowed ground.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Kansas City and, I think, the whole country,'' Orman said,
``the stores that are doing best are family-owned businesses,
usually in a single location, that own their own real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, to list just a few examples, he said,
``you've got Cousins, third generation, and Fuhr's, second
generation; there is us and Benchmark, two locations but first
generation, and they own their own land.''
</P>
<P>
   Owning property rather than leasing often is a big advantage for
furniture dealers, who need lots of room to showcase their wares.
</P>
<P>
   Those solidly established operations are thriving in comparison
with Levitz, which is sacrificing its area stores to a national
belt-tightening; Rhodes Furniture, whose slow sales nationally were
cited in corporate parent Helig-Meyers Co.'s latest earnings
report; and Greenstreet Interiors, whose out-of-state owners
recently closed the Country Club Plaza area store they had leased
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Benchmark, in contrast, appears to be thriving. Its owners, who
didn't return telephone calls for this article, have signed a pact
with one of the country's biggest furniture makers to build one of
the region's largest sales and distribution complexes in Olathe.
Going through a tunnel
</P>
<P>
   Similar stories abound in other cities, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be consolidation under way throughout the
industry,'' said Bob Price, a divisional merchandising manager at
J.C. Penney Co. Inc.'s headquarters in Plano, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Penney, for instance, has yanked furniture out of some of
its stores. And in 36 communities, including Overland Park, it has
moved furniture departments out of sometimes-cramped
department-store space to freestanding home centers that are 40
percent larger.
</P>
<P>
   Rival Sears, Roebuck and Co. went a step further in January by
converting its former HomeLife division _ about 100 freestanding
stores and 30 more within existing Sears stores _ into a separate
HomeLife company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furniture retailing is going through a bit of a tunnel right
now,'' said Dave Griesbaum, HomeLife's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   What executives have a hard time predicting is what they will
find at the end of that tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics are hard to come by, but calculations based on sales
tax collections and similar revenue yardsticks generally indicate
that furniture sales last year rose 4 percent to 5 percent, or
about half as fast as home sales.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how accurate those numbers are because sales
through catalogs and department stores, for example, often aren't
counted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is the notion that there may be many empty dining
rooms and other spaces where home sales have bloomed in beds of low
mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just aren't too many of us out there who are fortunate
enough to have threes or fives or tens of thousands of dollars left
over for furniture,'' said Greg Crowley, owner of Crowley Furniture
in Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Because furniture is the third most costly purchase for many
families, after a home and a car, Crowley and many other retailers
offer deferred-financing plans.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, many operators try to outhustle their bigger rivals.
Department store chains such as J.C. Penney typically offer at
least 90 days before payments begin. Crowley and other independents
sometimes try to beat that by extending the grace period to as much
as two years.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers offer these loans for the sake of flexibility and as a
marketing tactic, but they really don't push them, Crowley said.
That's because to get money now, retailers almost always must sell
the loans, at a discount, to a commercial finance company, which
will do the collecting when the grace period is up.
New competition
</P>
<P>
   Some lag time between home buying and furniture buying is
normal, industry veterans say. Many families make do with their
existing furniture until they've replenished some of their savings
or until they see what would fit best in the new space.
</P>
<P>
   There is another possibility. Sales may appear to be lagging
because customers may be buying from a new group of competitors,
said Christine Jobes. A former furniture chain executive, Jobes now
is an analyst at the National Retail Federation in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Stores such as Crate and Barrel, Pottery Barn, Restoration
Hardware and others that aren't traditionally considered furniture
stores are attracting two important groups of furniture buyers,
Jobes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't buying furniture so much as collecting things
they'd like for their lives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Younger buyers, who are perhaps more affluent than before
because they are marrying and starting new homes later in life, are
buying more items in these lifestyle specialty stores because they
like the styles, Jobes said.
</P>
<P>
   Their baby boomer parents often show up there, too, to replace
what they had while they were growing up.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to gauge how much business these lifestyle specialty
stores might be pulling from more conventional furniture retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Lifestyle specialty stores barely registered as a fast-growing
new market when the trade publication /{Furniture Today/} last
spring asked manufacturers which potential distribution channels
looked hottest for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Product specialty stores _ such as leather, mattress and baby
furniture outlets _ ranked similarly low on the previous survey two
years earlier, but they rank third on the latest list, just behind
struggling multicity chains such as Levitz.
</P>
<P>
   Further explosive growth seems likely for specialty stores
unless the economy tanks badly, said John Francis, a furniture
designer and owner of Unique Furniture Options in Westport.
</P>
<P>
   UFO, as the nearly 3-year-old store is informally called, is a
specialty store in both senses of the Furniture Today categories.
It does a primarily special-order business in high-end furniture
and fabrics. Customers are as apt to have checked out Restoration
Hardware, Pottery Barn or some other competing lifestyle store as a
conventional furniture store.
</P>
<P>
   But Francis said he thought a locally owned independent could
compete against the new specialty stores, too.
</P>
<P>
   Francis said that, as an independent, he could provide a level
of sophisticated customer service that corporately guided
competitors could only hope to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   The secret is in listening, Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be bold of us to presume we know what
customers want before they tell us,'' he said.

12 RULES THAT SPELL SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ The notes for this column were scratched
on the back of a grocery receipt, the only paper scrap handy at a
recent breakfast. Sometimes, good tips come unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   I write about workplace issues for a living. That involves
attending a lot of seminars on management, labor relations,
training and teamwork. I've heard days upon days of ``expert''
advice about how to get hired, get along, get ahead, get rich.
</P>
<P>
   But it was at a recent high school academic honors breakfast
where I heard 12 rules that, if everybody followed them, could
pretty well make all the other success blather unnecessary. The
rules, penned by astronomer and author Carl Sagan, were shared by
Richard Siebs, principal of Blue Valley North High School.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase:
</P>
<P>
   1. Be a good ``baloney'' detector.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pick something difficult and learn it well.
</P>
<P>
   3. Don't be afraid to ask dumb questions.
</P>
<P>
   4. Engage in lifelong learning activities and discuss them with
others.
</P>
<P>
   5. Listen.
</P>
<P>
   6. Realize everyone makes mistakes. Be open to criticism and
tolerant of others' errors.
</P>
<P>
   7. Know the planet and take care of it.
</P>
<P>
   8. Don't spend too much time watching television.
</P>
<P>
   9. Learn about your own culture (read the great books, etc.) and
learn about other cultures. Value them all.
</P>
<P>
   10. Be active in the democratic process. (Yes, that means
politics.)
</P>
<P>
   11. Search for the truth.
</P>
<P>
   12. Be compassionate. Don't live solely for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Siebs added a 13th rule, suggested by his wife:
</P>
<P>
   Find joy in what you do.
</P>
<P>
   Siebs was talking to straight-A students who know something
about commitment and success. He could have congratulated them and
sent them on to their first-hour classes. Instead he prodded them
to commit more.
</P>
<P>
   You might already have dismissed Sagan's ``rules'' as the kind
of inspirational drivel you'd see on a poster with a bird soaring
above the words. But ask yourself _ honestly _ how easy they are to
live by.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout our working lives, we're fed baloney and asked to
swallow it whole. Many of us stick to a comfort zone instead of
trying for a promotion, going back to school or switching careers.
</P>
<P>
   We sit mute in meetings, afraid to ask questions, or we're so
busy pontificating and formulating our own thoughts that we fail to
hear what others are saying. When we do hear something radically
new or different, we are suspicious, if not dismissive.
</P>
<P>
   We cover our backsides and hope blame hits another target, yet
we eagerly pounce on a victim when it wasn't our fault.
</P>
<P>
   We take the expedient way rather than the ecological one. We do
the couch potato act in front of sitcoms instead of reading a book.
We don't bother to vote because we don't know and don't care what's
going on.
</P>
<P>
   We spout our own truths. We look out for ourselves. And, surveys
say, many of us hate our jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have to be that way. Sagan, who searched the cosmos
for cosmic answers, knew that. He recognized the power of the
individual to search, to choose and to change. That's a profound
lesson, not just for students, but for us all.

 &HT;    ATTN COX EDs: Palm Beach Post Out.
 &HT;    CLINTON NAMES MACKAY LATIN AMERICAN ENVOY
 &HT;    EDs: With optional add that begins at 350 words.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Thursday tapped former Florida
Gov. Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay to be his new envoy to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, 65, fills the post formerly held by Robert ``Mack''
McLarty, Clinton's first chief of staff, who left the
administration last year.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, who had been in discussions with the administration for
several weeks, said he learned about the decision Thursday morning
when Clinton called and asked if he would take the job. He said he
expects to remain in the post through the remainder of Clinton's
term until January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment, which carries a salary of about $125,000 a
year, does not require Senate confirmation. MacKay will plunge into
the job next week when he accompanies Clinton on a trip to Central
America to inspect hurricane damage in Nicaragua, Honduras, El
Salvador, and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, who spearheaded the Summit of the Americas in Miami in
1994 and served on the House Foreign Affairs Committee while he as
in Congress in the 1980s, said he has long been interested in Latin
America and appreciated its importance to Florida and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very important role and one that will mean a
great deal to (Florida) and the country,'' MacKay said in a
telephone news conference. ``The future of this country, and
particularly (Florida), is very involved with what happens in Latin
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sunshine State is particularly sensitive to conditions in
Latin America, MacKay said, noting that adverse conditions there
can spur new waves of migration -- both legal and illegal -- to
Florida's shores. The state is also susceptible to drug trafficking
from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is on the frontline. We're really the gateway to Latin
America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, who does not speak Spanish, said learning the language
will be one of his first priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Other priorities will be learning the ropes of the new job --
which includes dealing with the U.S. State Department, National
Security Council, the drug czar's office and others.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   He'll also be looking for a place to live in the Washington,
D.C. area. MacKay will be based at the White House, but was unclear
late Thursday whether he would work in the West Wing -- where
McLarty worked -- or next door in the Old Executive Office
Building.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington Post story earlier this week speculated on whether
MacKay would have the same access to Clinton as McLarty. Although
personally not as close to Clinton as McLarty, a childhood friend
of the president, MacKay has had a close political relationship
with him. MacKay headed both of Clinton's presidential campaigns in
Florida, and the president stumped the state for MacKay during last
year's unsuccessful gubernatorial bid. MacKay said he was confident
he would have access to the president when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most difficult hurdles, MacKay said, will be in
convincing Latin American leaders of United States' interest in
lowering trade barriers in the wake of last year's failure to pass
so-called ``fast track'' trade authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hemispheric integration is in all of our interests,'' he said.

   UNDATED: Monica might have been bearable _ poor, sad little
dope.
</P>
<P>
   But not Walters. We just couldn't stomach Walters, so we passed
up the night's big attraction. In the two-week promotional blitz
that preceded the interview, we'd already seen more than enough.
</P>
<P>
   There in the teasers was Barbara _ mother confessor, grand
inquisitor _ fixing her subject with that wounded-doe stare and
asking, in a voice positively gooey with unctuousness, ``Monica,
are you still in luuuuv with Bill Clinton?''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, lordy, give us a break! Only a peep show like that one could
make Larry Flynt sound classy by comparison. There just is no
extreme of tastelessness to which television will not go to trump
the competition in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   And there's still the book to look forward to _ on the shelves
any day, if it isn't already.
</P>
<P>
   Then there'll be the movie. Or, wait a minute _ we've had that
movie, haven't we!
</P>
<P>
   Next maybe the Monica pinup calendar.
</P>
<P>
   After that the life-size Monica inflatable toy.
</P>
<P>
   Then the inevitable anniversary pieces in the print media.
``Remembering Impeachment,'' the headlines will read. Year after
year after year.
</P>
<P>
   And meantime, the indefatigable Mr. Starr will plunge on boldly
where no man has gone before, with his fourth or fifth prosecution
of poor Webster Hubbell, and his 10th of Susan McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred by misconduct proceedings against him, he will
convene yet another grand jury to examine the malfeasance and
slipshod work of previous grand juries.
</P>
<P>
   Time will have passed. A lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   Lucianne Goldberg will be circulating the manuscript of Jane Doe
No. 37.
</P>
<P>
   And Republican leaders in Congress will be sitting down with the
pundits on the Sunday morning talk shows to try to explain the
electorate's maddening indifference to moral instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't anybody, anybody, understand that the country's
tolerance for this stuff is exhausted? The public appetite for
garbage may be disheartening, but it is not insatiable.
</P>
<P>
   I hope the ratings show that only 35 households nationwide saw
that television abomination, and most of them tuned in only long
enough to see how Monica was wearing her hair and how much new
plastic surgery Barbara was sporting.
</P>
<P>
   And after that, they switched to whichever true-cops show
happened to be on.
</P>
<P>
   I hope the publisher takes a bath on the tell-all book (or
books), and Ken Starr stumbles off finally into the sunset, still
clutching a fistful of unserved subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   I would wish for Linda Tripp a lifetime spent in a house of
rooms with mirrored walls.
</P>
<P>
   I hope those newspaper readers turned away by the prurience and
sensationalism of the press's coverage will one day forgive and
come back to us.
</P>
<P>
   And for myself and the rest of the journalist tribe, I pray
there'll be no temptation ever to write about this matter again.
Certainly there'll be no need to.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's over. It really is!
</P>
<P>
   Over. Over. Over.

REPORT CITES ROUTINE ABUSE OF WOMEN PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Women inmates in American prisons and jails
routinely endure rape and other sexual abuse by male guards and are
denied proper medical care, according to an Amnesty International
USA report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   William Schulz, executive director of the human rights
organization, said the report ``found that sexual abuse is
virtually a fact of life for incarcerated women in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides raping female inmates, male guards often touch
prisoners' breasts and genitals during daily pat-downs and strip
searches, watch women as they shower and dress and, in rare cases,
sell women to male inmates for sex, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual abuse of women inmates is torture, plain and simple,''
Schulz said.
</P>
<P>
   He said 12 states have no law prohibiting sexual contact between
women and their jailers. Those states are Alabama, Kentucky,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, Utah, Vermont,
Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Craig, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Prisons, said
the agency would take the Amnesty report into consideration, but
that because it was based on anecdotal evidence, it was difficult
to evaluate its validity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have had and will continue to have zero tolerance
for abuse of any kind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the London-based Amnesty International, a human
rights organization that fights for the release of political
prisoners, has published several reports on prison conditions
throughout the world. This document is based on the reports of
female inmates and court cases over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The report also described serious problems in the medical care
provided to women inmates, citing examples of womens' legs being
shackled to bedposts during birth. Other examples of improper
medical care included denying prisoners routine gynecologic
services and proper prenatal care.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Marie Thorburn, former medical director of corrections for
the state of Hawaii, said her state's prison system was ``fraught
with human rights abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From my 20 years of experience in the system, I firmly believe
that there is no place where the abuses of our prison system are
more apparent than in our women's prisons,'' said Thorburn, who now
works with Amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Thorburn said the exact number of sexual abuse cases occurring
each year in U.S. prisons was difficult to determine because many
women inmates fear they will be punished if they report any
misconduct by guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that women prisoners don't trust the guards or
the prison doctors, so they hide the crimes in order not to get in
any more trouble,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Bureau of Prisons is working to ensure women inmates
are treated fairly and that any improper conduct is eliminated,
Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said 31,000 prison employees have undergone training to
prevent sexual misconduct and that female inmates now receive
instructions in how to report problems and abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Craig added that 10 prison employees were disciplined last year
and seven were prosecuted for sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   While praising the prosecutions, Schulz said no amount of
training would be enough to prevent the sexual abuse of women
inmates by male guards. He said the only way to effectively stop
the abuse was to have women inmates guarded by other women.
</P>
<P>
   The report said maltreatment had become critical because of the
explosive growth in the number of women prisoners, which more than
tripled between 1985 and 1997, from 39,000 to 138,000. During that
same time period, the number of women inmates had risen an average
of 11 percent per year, compared with 7.9 percent for men.
</P>
<P>
   The Amnesty report said the steep rise was the result of the
nation's war on drugs, which began under President Ronald Reagan
and ushered in stiff penalties for drug possession.
</P>
<P>
   But as the number of women inmates increased, the nation's
prisons and jails did not keep up in building proper facilities or
in hiring women guards. For example, in federal prisons, 70 percent
of the people guarding women inmates are men. In Canada, 91 percent
of those guarding female inmates are women.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the incidents cited in the Amnesty report is the case of
Sherrie Chapman, 39, an inmate at the California Institute for
Women, who noticed lumps on her breasts in 1985. For the next nine
years, she asked the medical staff for attention, telling them of
her long family history of breast caner.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when the lump in her right breast was protruding into
her armpit and could be seen externally, she was given a mammogram
by an outside physician. She has undergone two mastectomies and a
hysterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, the Bureau of Prisons agreed to pay $500,000 to
three women who said they were sexually abused at the Federal
Detention Center in Pleasanton, Calif., if they agreed not to sue.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, one of the women, Robin Lucus, 33, said
that in August 1995 she was sent to a male facility after an
altercation with another prisoner. While sleeping in her cell, she
was attacked by a male inmate who attempted to rape her. As she
fought back, the male inmate threw her against the metal bedpost,
cutting her head.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened by the blood coming from Lucus' forehead, the male
inmate fled, said Lucus, who was sentenced to 33 months in prison
for conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Lucus said she complained to prison officials, but there was no
investigation of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, she said, three men entered her cell and attacked
her. Again she fought back, but this time the men overpowered her
and raped her.
</P>
<P>
   Lucus said she later learned that at the facility, male
prisoners paid guards to let them into the cells of women inmates
to rape them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad but common state of affairs when women feel
compelled to trade sex for favors or special privileges in what
amounts to an extortion scheme of prey and predator,'' she said.

IT TOOK ACTORS, REAL HOODLUMS TO MAKE `LOCK, STOCK'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By  BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _LOS ANGELES _ Lads. Geezers. Villains. Hardmen.
Hooligans.
</P>
<P>
   The English working class has many colorful terms for gangsters,
and the above and many more fly fast and furiously throughout
``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.'' A complicated crime comedy
set in London's rough-and-tumble East End, the film pits dozens of
young and not-so-young toughs against one another in an escalating
series of rip-offs and reprisals initially marked by verbal jousts
but increasingly settled by firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds familiar? Not if you listen closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see the film, you won't say it's a British `Pulp
Fiction,''' writer-director Guy Ritchie says of his first feature
film. ``It does fall under that umbrella, and I don't mind that
people like to compartmentalize these things, but it's quite its
own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very original,'' adds Steve Tisch, one of the
film's executive producers. ``It's got a story that's a lot of fun
to follow, even the bad guys are charming in their way; but while
I've read that Guy Ritchie has been described as Tarantino-like, I
don't agree with those comparisons. He really does stand alone.''
</P>
<P>
   British audiences apparently detect something uniquely pleasing
in the film. The modestly budgeted, $1.6 million production has
grossed $22 million in the United Kingdom alone; that places it in
the the top rank of homegrown Brit hits, an exclusive turf occupied
by the likes of ``The Full Monty,'' ``Four Weddings and a Funeral''
and ``Trainspotting.'' Ritchie is already overseeing a television
series based on the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty good for a movie starring scads of mostly unknown young
Englishmen. The biggest name in the cast is rock star Sting, who
has a few scenes as a publican (and whose wife, Trudie Styler, was
an executive producer). The most familiar faces, to Brits anyway,
belong to the late, bare-knuckle boxer Lenny McLean and soccer star
Vinnie Jones, both of whom play enforcers for a neighborhood
godfather, Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarty).
</P>
<P>
   The film's main focus is on a half-dozen competing gangs of guys
in their 20s. The main group we follow _ the de facto good guys, if
you will _ consists of Eddie (Nick Moran), whose loss of 500,000
British pounds in a rigged card game with Hatchet Harry sets a
series of schemes in motion; Tom (Jason Flemyng), a shady
entrepreneur; Bacon (Jason Statham), an even shadier sort who
peddles stolen goods on sidewalks; and Soap (Dexter Fletcher), who
actually has a legal job as a chef.
</P>
<P>
   The lads toured America, along with Sting, Jones and Ritchie, to
promote ``Lock, Stock'' recently. Many others associated with the
movie probably would not have gotten visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 75 percent of the guys in the movie are real
criminals,'' Ritchie estimates. ``I kid you not. They are actors,
but they also happen to be villains. Fifty percent of them are
ex-cons, and 25 percent of them ... I'd hate to think what they get
up to that they haven't been nicked for yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the theory behind that is, for this genre, it was much
easier to cast those people for these kinds of roles because
they've spent so much of their lives acting in front of magistrates
or whatever. They're very familiar with putting on a face, and
their timing is impeccable. So once you can demystify the camera _
maybe throw a wig on it and make it look like a judge _ you've got,
I think, a highly trained actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the gravel-voiced Statham used to earn his living
selling stolen goods out of a suitcase, just like his character
does in the movie. He tells good stories, too; even though the
film's press materials explain that Ritchie first spotted Statham
modeling in a Levi's jeans ad, he has a more interesting tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happened to be working on the streets one day, and Guy
Ritchie comes past and buys five sets of hooky jewelry off me,''
Statham says. ``He came back later in the day, stitched-up and
asking for his money back, and I said two words to him. One of them
was `off.'
</P>
<P>
   ``With that, he said, `You cheeky little so-and-so. I'll give
you a part in my film.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Flemyng, Fletcher and Moran _ properly trained actors all _
working with actual villains was no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come from a posher version of the neighborhood in this
film,'' says the tall, blond Flemyng, who speaks the most
decipherable English of the lot. ``But these kinds of characters,
they pepper our existence, if you know what I mean. We all live in
areas _ hopefully not for too long! _ which these people
frequent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very British film in some respects, and the roughnecks
brought a certain authenticity to it,'' adds Moran, who resembles a
young Stevie Winwood. ``But we also had them out of their own
environment, and we were in our environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were out to make a film, not rob a bank,'' adds Fletcher, a
former child actor who has the most extensive filmography of the
team, including an appearance in one of the handful of classic
English crime movies, ``The Long Good Friday.'' ``If it was the
opposite, we would've asked their advice. But it was a great
leveler. They weren't being hardmen or bank robbers, they were
trying to make this film, trying to be actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we were trying to be actors, as well,'' Fletcher adds with
a laugh. ``So we all kind of coalesced. There was no room for big
egos.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there room for the kind of graphic violence that
American crime films revel in. Though many die by the movie's
conclusion, Ritchie prefers to show the aftermath rather than the
commission of bloodshed, a strategy that has no doubt led to the
picture's wide acceptance in gun-shy Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in action stuff, but as a director I've never
been interested in car chases, explosions or blood and violence in
the gratuitous sense,'' Ritchie says. ``But it is a film and
villains, so people need to get slapped. You need to imply that,
but people don't need to have that rubbed in their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more engaging for an audience to imagine what's
happened,'' Sting reckons, ``rather than just to show every detail
of blood spilling out of people's heads.''
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the things that attracted Sting to the project.
But the main draw was ``my wife's enthusiasm for the script,'' he
says. ``She really believed that the script worked, that it was
funny and it had energy. She was right.''
</P>
<P>
   That script also impressed American producer Steve Tisch
(``Forrest Gump,'' ``American History X'') enough to make him
invest some of his own money in the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big boy, and I certainly knew the risks going in, but I
instinctively felt that this had a real shot at working,'' says
Tisch, who has already made a substantial profit on his investment.
But he also acknowledges that, outside of festival screenings and
good reaction from critics, ``We still don't know how it's going to
play over here.'' The thick, Cockney slang that runs rampant
through ``Lock, Stock'' could be a challenge for American ears. But
Tisch never considered subtitles for the States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what's great and special about the film is the way
that the audience settles in and listens very closely because of
the dialect and the accents; that's part of the fun of seeing the
movie,'' the producer says. ``I think you've got to focus pretty
hard on what they're saying for the first five minutes, but once
you find that comfort level, I think the rest is just a great
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, subtitles would be antithetical to the kind of
boisterous lad culture that the movie celebrates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working-class people and, of course, we're very proud of
it,'' says Vinnie Jones, who plays the movie's debt collector, Big
Chris, a professional intimidator who brings his pre-teen son along
on strong-arm jobs. ``We feel like we've gotten out of the trap so
many are stuck in, and we want to represent them people.''
</P>
<P>
   But these blokes are no fools; they're hoping ``Lock, Stock's''
success will translate to America ... and that that will translate
to high-paying Hollywood jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll grovel,'' former fence Statham says of their desire for
work in the U.S. ``We'll grovel! I'd play Kate Winslet in `Titanic
2'!''
</P>
<P>
   They all probably would, given the offer. Although at least one
of these tough-talking hoodlums would have to get his mother's
permission first.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so unvillain and ungangsterlike, but it is true,''
Flemyng sheepishly admits. ``When I left home, my mum got out a
compass, drew a two-mile circle around the house on a map and said,
`You can't move out of this area.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That really is what you call tied to the apron strings,''
Fletcher says, ribbing his colleague in cinematic crime. ``Apron
strings about two miles long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 'cause real geezers look after their mothers,'' Flemyng
ripostes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's the other way around with Jason; his mother looks
after him,'' Moran interjects with the kind of perfect timing you
usually only hear in the best movies.
</P>
<P>
   And that's heard throughout ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking
Barrels.''!end! &QL;

AMERICA SMUG ABOUT ``WINNING'' COLD WAR, GORBACHEV SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARRENSBURG, Mo. _ Mikhail Gorbachev doesn't like hearing
American politicians gloat about ``winning'' the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The boasting threatens to destroy the already fragile
relationship between the United States and his country, he said
Wednesday night at Central Missouri State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Russian) government has been acting on the basis of an
inferiority complex...while America is acting on the basis of a
superiority complex, a winner's complex,'' the former Soviet Union
president said at a press conference before his speech. ``Frankly,
I don't think the American people hold that view, but the
politicians are saying, `We won the Cold War.' This is not a good
complex because it makes for too much arrogance. It makes for an
inability to work with other partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990, received a
gracious welcome from about 7,000 people gathered in the school's
gymnasium. He was brought in as keynote speaker for the
university's Excellence in Governance award ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   University President Ed Elliott won this year's award, which is
given by the students.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gorbachev stuck to a somewhat dry recounting of
how the former Soviet Union, now broken up into independent
nations, came to a better understanding with the United States and
opened up its economy and political system under his watch.
</P>
<P>
   But he also gave a glimpse of the problems in the Soviet Union
today, of the political disintegration, the financial struggles and
the inefficiency that make everyday life a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   And he warned against increasing Americanization of the world,
while also emphasizing that respect of the ``God-given'' diversity
of nations, cultures and ideologies will make the world more
peaceful and productive.
</P>
<P>
   Several Russian exchange students who are studying at William
Jewell College in Liberty made the hourlong trip to Warrensburg to
hear Gorbachev speak.
</P>
<P>
   Natalia Lavrshina, 21, a political science student from St.
Petersburg, Russia, said she had never seen Gorbachev in person.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev said young people in both countries will help improve
the relationship between the two former bitter enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the young people,'' he said. ``I represent the
older generations, and we carry the burden of our old experiences.
It is not easy for us to abandon old dogma and stereotypes....The
young people don't carry the burden of the legacy of the Cold War.
They will bring our world to a different place, a different
relationship between nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavrshina agreed, saying that Americans should get to know her
country better, and Russians should try to understand America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't understand Russia. You have your government to
thank for that. They don't want you to understand,'' she said.
``People ask me what I think of America, and I say it's just like
Russia. The political machine is the same _ there are just some
different ideologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Luda Milashenko, 19, an international business student from
Moscow studying at William Jewell, said she was disappointed that
Gorbachev did not talk in depth about Russia's serious problems of
corruption and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't offer any solutions,'' she said. ``He was just
talking about the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Gorbachev, the improvement of relations between the two
superpowers in the 1980s holds the secret to bettering the current
relationship, which is challenged by serious economic inequality.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled talking to former President Ronald Reagan about how
average Americans and Russians got along while together, even as
the political leaders were mired in distrust.
</P>
<P>
   He said he told Reagan: ``If we cannot get along, the people
should kick us out. I am happy that President Reagan and I were
able to get along.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience applauded.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS RECOUNT TENSE MOMENTS OF NEAR-COLLISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. CRONKLETON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. _ As anxious air traffic controllers looked on, two
blips on the radar screen slowly converged, until there was but
one.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve seconds later, as the radar beacon swept around again,
the dot disappeared from the screen.
</P>
<P>
   For about a minute Tuesday morning, the controllers, who had
been unable to make radio contact with two cargo planes heading
close to a collision high over Kansas, could only wonder if they
had just witnessed a midair disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a helpless feeling, a very helpless feeling,'' said
Howard Blankenship, the facility representative for the National
Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents the
controllers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The controllers basically watched these two airplanes come
together,'' he said. ``There was disbelief that something like that
could actually happen. What controllers are trained to do is keep
them apart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had to wait to see,'' said David Bennett, an air
traffic controller at the Kansas City Air Route Traffic Control
Center in Olathe.
</P>
<P>
   No tragedy occurred, but the airplanes came very close. How
close is still being investigated; estimates vary from 100 feet to
more than 2,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the
incident, which involved a Federal Express McDonnell Douglas DC-10
traveling from Portland, Ore., to Memphis, Tenn., and a Kitty Hawk
International Lockheed L-1011 traveling from Los Angeles to
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we actually do our investigation, we can't really tell
you what happened,'' said Paul Schlamm, a safety board spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we have a very safe air transport and aviation
system,'' he said. ``Sometimes there are problems, but we make
recommendations to try to avoid those problems in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   About 10:40 a.m. Tuesday, Bennett was notified that two aircraft
were leaving Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center's airspace and
entering the Kansas City center's airspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver did not have communication with them, so that meant
that they were not able to transfer communication to us,'' Bennett
said. ``They called and said: `Hey, these two are coming together.
It could get ugly.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the planes were about 12 to 15 minutes apart.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Christopher, a Dallas spokesman for Kitty Hawk International
Inc., which is based in Detroit, said Kitty Hawk's aircraft was in
contact with the Denver center and had received instructions to
switch frequencies to talk with the Kansas City center. He said the
pilots attempted to do so but were unable to reach the Kansas City
center.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft have entered a center's airspace without having contact
with air traffic controllers before. But it is not common, Bennett
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is also rare for two aircraft to lose radio contact in the
same area, let alone two aircraft flying at the same altitude on a
collision path, Blankenship said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said, ```There are procedures you do to get a hold of
them, and normally it works.''
</P>
<P>
   So controllers tried the various procedures, including using
alternative communication systems that companies subscribe to,
calling the companies directly to have them alert their planes and
using an emergency frequency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used every means that we had at the time and just were not
able to get ahold of them,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   When the planes got within three to four minutes of each other,
controllers started moving other planes away from the area so that
if one of the planes established contact, evasive maneuvers could
be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the blips merged into one. Twelve seconds later, the blip
disappeared because the two radar reflections canceled each other
out. The blip didn't return for twelve more seconds. Then there
were two blips again.
</P>
<P>
   The planes' crews immediately contacted controllers wanting to
know why they had almost collided. Controllers explained their
inability to establish radio contact and told the crews to report
back once they landed.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Davenport, spokeswoman for Federal Express Corp. in
Memphis, said, ``We certainly are aware of the incident, but
because it is under investigation presently by the NTSB, we are not
able to provide any additional information or speculate to what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher disputed reports that the aircraft came within 100
feet of each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they did come within 100 feet of each other, the pilots
still would not be able to talk,'' he said. ``The aircraft were
moving about 450 miles per hour, and they are huge airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimated the planes came within 1,300 to 2,600 feet of each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher said the planes ``weren't supposed to be that close
together, but when they got close together they saw each other and
took evasive action.''

COMPUTER EFFECTS MAKE `DREAMS' SWEETER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Watching ``What Dreams May Come'' is an
uplifting experience. Not so much because the film's story, which
is a modern-day treatment of the Orpheus legend with a new-agey
twist, but because of its stunning special effects that augur some
wondrous cinematic times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfortunate that ``Dreams,'' which is being released on
video Tuesday, doesn't match its visual inventiveness. Written by
Ron Bass, who won an Oscar for ``Rain Man,'' ``Dreams'' follows
Chris (Robin Williams), a doctor, into the afterlife when he is
killed in a car crash while rushing home to his wife, Annie
(Annabella Sciorra).
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that, if you're deserving, the afterlife is pretty
much what you imagine it to be. In Chris' case, he finds himself in
a world that is much like his wife's paintings, slightly
impressionistic, colorful and romantic.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Chris maneuver through this fantastic artistic
landscape is eye-opening, as he squishes through daubs of paint and
then soars above it.
</P>
<P>
   He is helped by a guide, Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.), who had been
Chris' mentor but takes on the guise of a younger version of
himself. Though in a form of heaven, all's not well with Chris. A
few years before he died, his two children were killed in an auto
accident, leaving his wife in a depression she had not recovered
from. Chris now wants to see his children but finds he can only see
them when the time is right. In the meantime, his wife _ unable to
face life without Chris, kills herself and is trapped in a
netherworld as a lost soul. When Chris finds out, he tries to
rescue her, traveling through hell with another guide (Max Von
Sydow).
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreams'' has its flaws _ particularly the pacing _ and the
Williams-Sciorra chemistry doesn't light any fires, though it does
seem sincere. At times, even the special-effect scenes are played
like they are there to wow you rather than being integrated with
the plot.
</P>
<P>
   The new-age feel to the questions of heaven and hell might be
off-putting to some, but ``Dreams'' should be commended for being
one of the first films to use the major advances in
computer-generated images (CGI) for something other than destroying
the world or building some dire futuristic universe. And even if
you have reservations about the story, it's provocative enough to
generate some discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Until you get your HDTV and DVD player, some of those special
effects are not going to match the film's big-screen visuals
(``Dreams'' comes out on DVD in May, by the way), but it still
offers enough of a taste to pique your interest. &QL;

DISNEY DOCUMENTARY: a few years ago, disney released the
documentary ``frank and Ollie'' about two of the studios' legendary
animators. Not only were Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnson co-workers
on such animated classics as ``Snow White and the Seven Drawfs,
``Pinocchio,'' ``Bambi,'' ``Peter Pan,'' Lady &AMP; the Tramp,
``Cinderella'' and ``The Jungle Book,'' the duo were also neighbors
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Set to be released on video Tuesday, the critically acclaimed
documentary uses film clips and interviews to tell the wonderful
story of these two men as well as tell the story of the Disney
animation empire, which they helped create.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, Disney is running out another of its classic
animated films on video. This time it's `101 Dalmatians.'' The 1961
film will only be on store shelves for _ you guessed it _ 101 days.

FARMLAND INDUSTRIES HELPED END COLLAPSE OF HOG PRICES LAST
DECEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ If hog farmers were as dramatic as stock
market investors, Dec. 14 would be remembered as Bloody Monday _
the day hog prices got slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for folks like Jim Phillips, whose livelihood depends
on hogs, December 1998 will live on as vividly as October 1987 does
for stock investors, a time when a market fell so fast and so far
that it nearly sucked the life out of an industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see it coming, and there was nothing you could do
about it,'' said Phillips, whose Cass County, Mo., hog farm was
losing $12,000 a week at the lowest prices. ``It was a financial
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The December market slide wiped out some hog farmers and left
others teetering on the brink.
</P>
<P>
   But the month might have been much worse had Farmland
Industries, the mammoth farm cooperative, not put its own earnings
at risk to help stanch the losses.
</P>
<P>
   On March 4 in Nashville, Tenn., the National Pork Producers
Council will hold its annual Pork Forum and thank Farmland for
helping change ``the market psychology nationally at a time that it
was desperately negative,'' said Al Tank, chief executive of the
council.
</P>
<P>
   By setting a minimum price for what it would pay its hog
customers, industry insiders said, Farmland interrupted the
psychology of panic, sending a signal of hope to producers at a
time when many thought they would lose their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, the market nationally bounced up from about
$10 per hundredweight of live hog to Farmland's price of $15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Kansas City company, Farmland, that took the bull by
the horns,'' U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. ``By
setting a floor, it had a lot to do with prices turning.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmland had to do something, according to Wayne Snyder,
Farmland vice president of livestock production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to interfere with the market's ability to
correct itself,'' Snyder said. ``But we wanted to send a signal to
the market that enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nashville, the hog-producing industry will contemplate its
future in light of the 1998 meltdown, which cost hog producers an
estimated $2.6 billion. Tank and other observers say that some of
the factors underlying the price slide remain and that similar
troubles could spread to other farm sectors.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened last December?
</P>
<P>
   At its simplest, hog production was up 10 percent, and hog plant
capacity was down 8 percent, thanks to a Canadian meat-packing
strike and some plant closings in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hog farmers, who need a price of about $41 per hundred pounds of
live hog to break even, had been losing money for months. Packing
plants added shifts and still couldn't keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Prices kept declining. In panic, some producers began selling
off their entire herds, feeding the supply glut that was causing
the price slide. It was like stuffing a whole pig down a python's
throat.
</P>
<P>
   By Dec. 14, some farmers were getting about $10 per hundred
pounds of live weight, less for a 240-pound hog than diners would
pay for a couple of pork rib dinners. With prices in single digits,
hog farmers faced having their entire net value rendered worthless.
</P>
<P>
   At Farmland's annual meeting, it became clear that the co-op had
to do something dramatic to protect its producers. Farmland ranks
among the largest pork-packing operators and is a big owner of hogs
itself, though most of the hogs turned into Farmland ham and bacon
come from small hog producers. MORE

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ small hog producers.
</P>
<P>
   After some debate, Farmland announced Dec. 22 it was paying its
customers a minimum of $15 per hundredweight for hogs delivered to
its four meat-packing plants.
</P>
<P>
   That gave producers hope, Tank said, and suddenly the panic
selling eased.
</P>
<P>
   If the market hadn't responded quickly to that signal, Farmland
faced losing tens of millions of dollars in its pork division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the situation gone on for a year, we could have lost twice
as much as our greatest annual earnings,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   By this week, hogs were bringing $26 to $28 per hundredweight,
still a loss but manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Though the market has rebounded, Snyder said he couldn't be sure
that it wouldn't crash again, and soon. The circumstances that
created the mess continue to hover over the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a real pessimistic view,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Tank agrees that the industry is walking a tightrope. He also
said the hog industry was a canary in a coal mine for the rest of
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other sectors are going to experience the exact economic
crisis that we experienced,'' Tank predicted. ``With more
efficiency, capacity and utilization become more important on
everything you do. There will be more volatility, more
specialization. Other industries should take very strong heed on
what can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem underlying the hog industry's troubles is natural.
Russell Lamb, senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank in
Kansas City, pointed out that hogs prefer to breed in cool weather.
As a result, hog producing is seasonal, with more breeding
occurring in the spring and pigs reaching their premium size of 240
to 260 pounds in November and December.
</P>
<P>
   When all of those hogs mature, it can be hard finding enough
slaughtering plants to handle them.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened in December for Phillips and his two sons,
who raise about 20,000 hogs a year. They had 400 hogs a week ready
for market and were having a hard time getting them sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't do any good to keep them any longer,'' Phillips
said. ``If you can't sell them one week, then you just have two
weeks' worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is economic, stemming from the profitability and
increasing concentration of the hog industry. Though hog prices are
cyclical, hogs in better years are by far the most profitable
category of farm production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hogs have been high margin over time,'' Lamb said. ``You can
make more on hogs than your returns in the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why companies such as Premium Standard Farms in Kansas
City and Seaboard Corp. of Merriam, Kan., have been able to attract
money from Wall Street to build huge hog farms and new packing
plants, Lamb said.
</P>
<P>
   Many family farmers have come to specialize in hog production as
well, industrializing the process to improve their margins. Good
prices in 1996 and 1997 encouraged producers to bump up herd sizes.
That helped set up the crisis of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Though some agriculture economists think the chaos of December
will have forced enough marginal hog producers out of the business
to bring supply and demand in line by midyear, Snyder is
unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   He worries that more packing plants might close because they are
inefficient money losers. He also said that with hog producers
specializing, it was harder for them to cull their herds. They bet
on everyone else doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Tank agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This used to be an industry of inners and outers,'' Tank said.
``People got in when prices were good and got out when they
declined. With more people specializing, the question is, Who is
going to leave the business? We haven't seen anyone blink yet.''

$5,000 a year, the federal limit for PAC contributions, donors get
to attend up to six of the PAC's advisory board meetings, plus ``an
invitation to join Newt and Marianne for an annual retreat.'' But
there's more. The appeal also makes clear that Gingrich's PAC
welcomes so-called soft money, large, unregulated contributions

Georgia. We talk to parents, students, teachers and reading
specialists about what's wrong with our reading instruction, and
how these weaknesses effect other aspects of a child's life --
self-control, interest in school, and aspirations for college and

Reading Challenge program. Experts will include professors at
Georgia State and David Denton of the Southern Regional Education
Board. (Cumming, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

 &HT;    CONGRESS MEMBERS STRUGGLE TO BALANCE DUTIES AND FAMILY
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects name to John Covey sted Thomas Coven in first two

 &HT;    780&AMP;add. For release Sunday, March 7.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In order to be elected, members of Congress must
promise to tirelessly serve their districts. They also must
demonstrate their devotion to family.
</P>
<P>
   Living up to both can be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job is becoming more demanding all the time,'' said Rep.
Chet Edwards, D-Texas, who recalls when Congress met only six
months a year, allowing lawmakers to spend a great deal of time
working in their home communities.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed. The congressional schedule is longer and
more unpredictable, leaving lawmakers constantly running in and out
of airports. The long hours, the stress of political life and the
grueling travel schedule can strain families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of politicians who glow in the limelight while
their children and families are dying in the shadows,'' said
Edwards. ``That is one mistake I will never make.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is much too short to spend four or five days a week
regularly away from your children and spouse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many political families, Edwards and his wife, Lea Ann,
decided to raise their two children, John Thomas, 3, and Garrison,
1, in their home district. As a result, John Thomas made about 20
airplane trips before his first birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the couple decided to move the family from Waco to the
national capital area _ an option often taken by senators, who
serve six years rather than two for House members.
</P>
<P>
   One reason behind the Edwards' decision is the House schedule,
which is already intense and may grow longer.
</P>
<P>
   Many members say the schedule is not ``family friendly,'' with
morning hearings, votes starting at midday and sometimes ending
long after a child's bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   Some still talk about the stressful year of 1995, when
Republican efforts to pass the party's ``family-friendly'' Contract
With America took an ironic toll on their personal life. At least
six 1994 freshmen ended up with broken marriages by 1996, and some
say the long hours and last-minute schedule changes played a big
part.
</P>
<P>
   Before deciding to resign from Congress, incoming Speaker Bob
Livingston proposed a five-day-a-week House schedule instead of the
current practice of conducting most business from Tuesday through
Thursday. The proposal, which members say is still under
consideration, would make it impossible for members to fly home to
work in their districts for half the week.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the five-day schedule would make House service
more predictable and allow more weeks off during the year.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., said it would be a ``disaster''
for members with families in their districts.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler spent the first few months of his first term living in
Washington while his wife and three children lived in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't do it,'' he said. ``It was extremely hard. I
cannot tell you how many times at 2, 3, 4 in the night I was on the
phone with my wife because she was up with the baby. In the most
perfect of marriages, it creates strain.''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler moved his family to the capital area more than a year
ago. ``That's not so easy either,'' he said. The Wexlers left both
sets of grandparents and a network of community support in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cynthia McKinney, who is divorced, commutes to Decatur,
Ga., at least twice a week. Her 13-year-old son Coy lives in
Georgia and stays with McKinney's parents when she is in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney said the choice of letting Coy grow up in Georgia
provides ``normalcy'' and a certain ``anonymity,'' while the
capital area is less than an ideal environment for raising
children.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, she said, ``everybody is the child of somebody
important. The sense of self-importance, I believe, gets blown way
out of proportion and you certainly don't want your children to get
infected with that disease.''
</P>
<P>
   But McKinney said living part-time away from her son is not
easy. About a month ago, she was reading some of her son's school
essays and realized her congressional schedule had a
``devastating'' impact on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that the job took his Mom away from him,'' she said.
``I felt terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney said the essay prompted her to be even more dedicated
to incorporating her son's life into her schedule and to improve
communication between them.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to help his colleagues avoid such pitfalls, Rep. Jack
Kingston, R-Ga., recently wrote an article in The Hill, a weekly
political newspaper, titled ``15 Ways to Keep your Family, Sanity
and Inner Harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingston advised lawmakers not to confuse their spouse with
their staff. ``Remember, your staff works for you _ your spouse
doesn't. You've already screwed up (your spouse's) life _ don't add
insult to injury.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Politicians are not alone in their growing concern about
balancing family life and work.
</P>
<P>
   John Covey and his brother Stephen have made millions of dollars
teaching people how to find such balance in their lives. Stephen
Covey is the author of ``The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,''
which has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   John Covey, who has developed and edited a new book about
``Highly Effective Families,'' gave a two-hour seminar at a
Democratic congressional retreat in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message hit them right in the bread basket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Covey told lawmakers to ``put the big rocks'' into their busy
schedules. The big rocks included one-on-one time with their spouse
and children and important family dates such as birthdays, planned
vacations and family traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Covey said politics has become more difficult in an age of
``information overload.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The political pressures are incredible,'' he said. ``The boss
is not only in the political arena, but you've got the media that
are just pushing'' and watching ``for any public or private
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a multiple stress for these people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who said he has taken a lot of Covey's advice to heart,
said that after 16 years in politics, he knows the world doesn't
revolve around his political career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The democracy will go on without Chet Edwards, but those
children only have one father,'' he said.

   HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ Neither a borrower nor a lender be. ...
Whateverrrrrrr!
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare has always enjoyed at least modest popularity in
Hollywood, with one movie studio or another taking a crack at his
plays in the form of faithful revivals or loose interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   But rarely has there been as big a rush as this year, when
audiences will get a chance to see works ranging from ``Titus
Andronicus,'' one of Shakespeare's least-known plays, to yet
another modernization of ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' this time
called ``Ten Things I Hate About You,'' set in a high school and
geared toward teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Six Shakespearean productions are scheduled to hit theaters
within the next year, three of them starring Julia Stiles and all
hoping to take advantage of the popularity of ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' a romantic fantasy that has little to do with the writer's
plays or life but has received 13 Academy Award nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nearly everyone in Hollywood considers Shakespeare a box
office liability, at least if audiences get the impression they
will have to listen to long, opaque soliloquies in antiquated
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is how do we overcome it, because there is audience
resistance,'' said Mark Gill, president of the West Coast
operations of Miramax Films, the Disney unit that is distributing
three of the new Shakespeare movies. ``The more contemporary they
are, the better the chance they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Junger, the director of ``Ten Things I Hate About You,''
said he had also been skeptical at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``My immediate reaction was, a teen-ager is just not going to be
interested,'' said Junger, until now a director for television,
including the episode in which Ellen DeGeneres declared she was a
lesbian on her sitcom, ``Ellen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want to do a Shakespeare movie because of the
commercial concerns,'' he said. ``But then I read the script and I
thought it was a great story. Then I said, `Of course, it's a great
story. It's Shakespeare.'''
</P>
<P>
   The film is scheduled to be released on March 31. In May, it
will be followed by ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' starring Calista
Flockhart, Kevin Kline and Michelle Pfeiffer. A version of
``Othello,'' also set in a high school and called ``O,'' again with
Ms. Stiles, is scheduled for an October release.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the year, there will be ``Titus Andronicus,'' directed
by Julie Taymor and starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, early next year there will be a contemporary
version of ``Hamlet,'' set in New York, starring Ethan Hawke, Bill
Murray and Ms. Stiles. That will be followed by a new version of
``Love's Labour's Lost,'' with Kenneth Branagh, Alicia Silverstone
and Nathan Lane, set in the 1930s and made with music by Cole
Porter, George Gershwin and Jerome Kern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all goes in cycles,'' Junger said. ``This may be over in a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   A Jackboot to Art
</P>
<P>
   Art, it is often said, transcends politics. ``The Harmonists''
is a cautionary tale about the risks of believing too much in that
old saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Harmonists,'' which opens on March 12, is a German movie
about an extremely successful a cappella singing group in the 1930s
whose members, like many Germans of the day, believed that the
Nazis might break a few windows, and even a few laws, but that they
would not interfere with the popular arts.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which has been quite successful in Germany, examines
how wrong they were.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on the true story of the Comedian Harmonists,
a popular singing group that was modeled on the American group the
Revellers. A play, ``Band in Berlin,'' scheduled to open in New
York on Sunday, is also based on the group's experience.
</P>
<P>
   The German group was formed in 1927 by Harry Frommermann, a
young man in love with music and eager to capture the upbeat
sassiness of the day. The group had six members, three Jewish. The
movie ends with the singers' forced dissolution in 1934, each one
shocked by the Nazis' belligerence, none yet aware of the extent of
their evil.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the movie has faced some criticism for not heavily
emphasizing the Holocaust, said Heino Ferch , the German actor who
plays Roman Cycowski, a Polish opera singer who was one of the
Jewish band members.
</P>
<P>
   Ferch, a former gymnast and acrobat, said the movie, while
ending on a note of foreboding, gives no direct hint of the
Holocaust. Some people, he said, had suggested the movie pulled its
punches in that respect.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, the film is stronger because it shows how people
only slowly woke up to the Nazis' real agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't necessary in a movie like this to go hard on the
Holocaust itself,'' Ferch said. ``It goes deeper in your heart, I
think, because you can see how these people reacted and their
denial. They were Jews, but they thought they were so popular, no
one would attack them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nazis began a crusade against what they considered Jewish
art or degenerate art, and banished or killed artists in many
fields.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie keeps its gaze tightly focused on the hopes,
dreams and personal lives of the Comedian Harmonists.
</P>
<P>
   In one striking scene, Ferch's character says he will marry his
girlfriend only if she converts to Judaism. She does, and the
wedding scene, shot in a synagogue in Prague, is a joyous occasion
filled with music and dancing, a stark counterpoint to the fate of
the group and millions of Jews across Europe.

   Dimming Star Power
</P>
<P>
   S. Abraham Ravid, a business professor at Rutgers University and
New York University, has produced a fairly dense academic paper
whose conclusions are supported with entries like ``mean of
dependent variable,'' ``adjusted R-squared'' and ``F-statistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper might not be of much interest outside academia except
that it appears to disprove several cherished theories about what
makes a movie profitable.
</P>
<P>
   By examining a random sampling of nearly 200 movies, Ravid said
he found that lower-budget movies tended to be more profitable than
big-budget pictures, even though they often generated less revenue;
movies with unknowns or lesser-known actors tended to be more
profitable than star-driven films; there was no statistical
correlation between the strength of reviews and profitability, but
that there was a relationship between the mere number of reviews,
no matter how positive, and profitability, and the strongest
correlation for profitability was a movie's having a G or PG
rating.
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, sequels tended to be more profitable than the
average movie.
</P>
<P>
   Ravid, a lifelong film buff and a former radio journalist in
Israel, said the conclusions in his paper, ``Information,
Blockbusters and Stars: A Study of the Film Industry,'' which is
scheduled to appear in The Journal of Business later this year,
surprised him. He said that he had undertaken the study to
understand the business rationale of paying top dollar for
Hollywood stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to know why would you hire an expensive star right up
front for a movie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The figures contradicted much of the Hollywood wisdom regarding
star power, he said. They also conflicted with some recent studies
that have purported to show that stars like Mel Gibson and Michelle
Pfeiffer have been the biggest profit generators.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons his study countered popular wisdom, he said,
was that he focused on the profitability of movies, not just their
box office revenues, and that, when looking at historical data on
older movies, he adjusted the revenues and profits for inflation,
so that direct comparisons could be made with current movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was actually very much rooting for the stars in my
analysis,'' Ravid said. ``Once I saw which way the results were
going, I tried several different definitions of a star and I was
wondering why it wasn't working out. But stars are not what they
seem to be. They often bring in higher revenues, but the
profitability is smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would the studios persist in paying up to $20 million to get
a major star in a movie if such films rarely generate big returns?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only speculate, but in an atmosphere of great
uncertainty, people try to play it safe,'' Ravid said. ``They can
say everyone else is doing it. That's my best interpretation.''

   MARINE-AVIATOR (Camp Lejeune, N.C.) _ A military jury acquitted
Capt. Richard J. Ashby Thursday of charges related to his piloting
of a warplane that hit a gondola cable in the Italian alps 13
months ago, killing 20 people. By Matthew L. Wald.

<P>
   SCI-LA-QUAKE (Undated) _ Using information once jealously
guarded by oil and gas companies, scientists have identified a
major new fault under downtown Los Angeles. Called the Puente Hills
blind thrust, the fault, which is active, lies hidden in the
basement of the metropolitan area and is capable of producing a
devastating earthquake. Scientists have inferred the existence of
such faults under the city for many years but this is the first
solid proof that one actually exists. By Sandra Blakeslee.

   BANANA-TRADE-WAR (Frankfurt, Germany) _ On Thursday, Marc
Ecrepont, general manager of Group Fremaux, which exports cotton
bedsheets, became a pawn in a trade war over bananas between the
United States and Europe. The United States is imposing a 100
percent tariff on those sheets in retaliation for the European
Union's refusal to abandon its banana import preferences. The
sanctions hit 15 categories of goods, none of which have any direct
link with bananas. The tariffs followed months of bitter feuding
over Europe's import preferences for bananas from its former
colonies. Neither side produces bananas itself, but both have
companies that market them, and both have elevated the issue to one
of righteous indignation. By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   BUDGET-REPUBS (Washington) _ The Republican leadership agreed
today on a plan that would bar Congress from spending Social
Security's money for other purposes while still promising a big tax
cut in coming years. The plan is the Republican response to
Clinton's call to reserve most of the surplus for Social Security
and Medicare, and is intended to insulate Republicans from
Democratic attacks that they are endangering the retirement system
to finance tax breaks for the wealthy. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-VIOLENCE (Belfast) _ As the formal peace process moves
ahead in Northern Ireland, horrific ``punishment'' beatings are on
the rise. It's a practice in which the paramilitary armies that
control working-class neighborhoods turn their violence not on
their declared enemies from the other side of the religious divide,
but on their own. By Warren Hoge.

   MEXICO-POLITICS (Mexico City) _ President Ernesto Zedillo urged

culminating in a national party convention. By Sam Dillon.

SURVEY: AMERICANS ON DIETS ARE CUTTING OUT GRAIN PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fad diets and bad nutritional advice are spurring
Americans to cut healthy foods such as rice, pasta, bread and
cereals from their daily consumption, according to a new Gallup
Organization survey released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 1,000 U.S. households found that 32 percent of
dieters completely eliminated entire food groups when trying to
lose weight, an action not typically encouraged by physicians or
nutritionists.
</P>
<P>
   And of those respondents, more people mistakenly perceived
grain-based foods as a contributor to weight gain than fatty or
salty foods, meats and dairy products. Grains typically are low in
calories and fat.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight percent of respondents eliminated all grains when
dieting as opposed to 24 percent who eliminated fatty foods, 15
percent who cut out salty snacks, 15 percent who eradicated meat
and 13 percent who nixed dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   Only sweets were considered a greater threat to the waistline
than grains, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Of those people who didn't eliminate entire food groups but
reduced food intake when dieting, grain products were curtailed
more than salty snacks, meats and dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   The results, said nutrition specialist Liz Applegate of the
University of California at Davis, suggest that Americans are
succumbing to get-thin-quick diets that tax the body and provide
little healthful benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest perpetrator, she said, are fad diets that advocate
dramatically curtailing carbohydrates, which are found in grain
products and provide energy for the body, while consuming
significant amounts of protein, usually found in meats, poultry,
fish and dairy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're setting yourself up for failure and potential heart
trouble when you cut out grain foods before fats to lose weight,''
said Applegate, a professor of nutrition at UC-Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, in the search for quick weight loss, consumers
become confused on how to achieve a healthy and balanced
lifestyle,'' she told a news conference where the survey results
were released. Applegate was an unpaid consultant on the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more popular high-protein diets espoused in
best-selling books are ``The Zone,'' by Barry Sears, ``Protein
Power'' by Michael Eades, and ``Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution,''
By Robert Atkins.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallup survey, which was commissioned by the Wheat Foods
Council and the American Bakers Association, found that after an
initial weight loss on a high-protein/low carbohydrate diet, people
tended to gain the weight back.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors and nutritionists cite healthy eating habits
coupled with regular exercise as the best method for reducing
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Federal dietary guidelines, known as the Food Guide Pyramid,
place a strong emphasis on grains. The guidelines call for six to
11 servings of grain products each day; three to five daily
servings of vegetables; two to four fruit servings; two to three
dairy servings; and two to three servings of meat, fish, poultry or
eggs. Americans are urged to consume fats, oils and sweets
sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey results, people are confused when it
comes to understanding certain basic nutrition issues.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the survey found that 82 percent of those surveyed
agreed that the Food Guide Pyramid is the basis for healthy diet.
But 59 percent believed the high-protein, low carbohydrate fad
diets are founded on sound nutrition principles.
</P>
<P>
   One possible reason for confusion is that consumers rely on
friends, relatives and the news media for nutrition advice. The
survey found that only 23 percent of those polled sought the
dieting advice of a doctor or nutritionist.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey was conducted Nov. 14-Dec. 1, 1998.

MOTHER NATURE BLOWS AWAY BRUINS   PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SECAUCUS, N.J. _ Mother Nature and coach Pat Burns combined
forces to give the Bruins an unexpected day off Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was one, Burns said, the team desperately needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, fresh off a 2-1 loss at Carolina Wednesday,
chartered here immediately after the game. They were expected to be
in the team hotel by midnight and had scheduled an off-day skate at
Montclair State University Thursday afternoon in preparation for
their game Friday with the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   But that's where Mother Nature came into play.
</P>
<P>
   High winds, hail, and snow squalls that caused widespread power
outages diverted the Bruins' plane from Newark to JFK International
Airport in New York. The team then took a bus here and didn't
arrive until just after 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were bushed, we wouldn't have accomplished much,'' said
Burns. ``We played Tuesday, we played (Wednesday) night, and we
have New Jersey coming up. It's been one tough stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   A stretch, though, that with 9 of a possible 12 points (4-1-1)
in the bank, has seen the Bruins catapult into the eighth and final
playoff spot _ 2 points ahead of Florida with 21 games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we forget (Wednesday) night,'' said Burns. ``It's
over, it's behind us. Let's think about New Jersey. It's a big
game. Heck, with only 21 left, they're all big games, especially
when you're fighting for a playoff spot like we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Kyle McLaren echoed Burns's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Points are critical at this part of the season,'' said
McLaren. ``You want to try and go out there and win every game. I
know you can't, but we're at the stage now where we have to do
everything we can to get every point we can.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren said he thought the Bruins suffered a bit of a letdown
at Carolina, especially after ringing up three wins and a tie in
their last four games at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our road game hasn't been up to par this year,'' he said.
Boston is 10-17-3 away from home. ``That's tough because the last
couple of years we played strong on the road and kind of struggled
at home. But the guys played hard (Wednesday) night. We were down,
2-1, and nobody quit. These guys care whether we win or lose and if
we can rebound that's a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren said it would be to the Bruins' advantage to get the
first goal against New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to get that first one,'' he said. ``I think that's a
confidence booster for this team. A team like New Jersey, you can't
give up much, because if they're up one or two, they basically shut
the door on you. They just play solid defense and have great
goaltending. We have to come out with the attitude that we're going
to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic Division-leading Devils (34-20-8) are the NHL's
best road team (20-8-2) but just 14-12-6 at Continental Airlines
Arena . . . Bruins wing Sergei Samsonov, sidelined with a sinus
infection that forced him to miss two games last week, said he
feels fine and thinks he's back to 100 percent. Samsonov, who had
22 goals and 25 assists last year when he was the NHL's top rookie,
is ahead of that pace. He takes 20 goals and 23 assists into
Friday's game.

LAWMAKERS INTRODUCE AIRLINE COMPETITION LEGISLATION. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: FILED in ``f'' and ``w'' categories)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bill aimed at boosting airline competition by
lifting federal limits on the number of hourly landings and
takeoffs at airports in Chicago and New York City was introduced in
the House Thursday by a bipartisan group of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation
Committee, said removing the limits would ``immediately increase
competition in the airline industry'' by allowing additional
flights at three of the nation's busiest airports. Shuster's
committee is scheduled to vote on the legislation next week.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to constituents' complaints about the cost of flying
to and from small and medium-sized cities and about the quality of
airline service, lawmakers have recently introduced several bills
dealing with both issues.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's measure, which is supported by more than 120 lawmakers
from both parties, would eliminate so-called slots at Chicago's
O'Hare and New York's Kennedy and LaGuardia airports by next March
1. An additional three flights a day would be added at Washington,
D.C.'s Ronald Reagan National Airport. The slot system, which
refers to the number of daily landings and takeoffs, was
implemented at the four airports in 1968 to reduce delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``All airlines, big and small, new or old, will now be able to
serve Chicago O'Hare, or New York's LaGuardia and Kennedy,'' said
Rep. William Lipinski, D-Ill., one of the bill's authors.
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski said he believes that eliminating the slots will make
airlines more willing to serve small- and medium-sized cities
without having to worry about using ``their precious few slots (at
the four big airports) on the most profitable routes.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many additional flights would be allowed at
O'Hare, Kennedy and LaGuardia airports. House Transportation
Committee staffers said the three airports have capacity to add
flights.
</P>
<P>
   At O'Hare 155 landings and takeoffs are currently allowed per
hour, 68 are allowed at LaGuardia and 60 at Reagan National. At
Kennedy Airport 88 hourly landings and takeoffs are allowed between
3 p.m. and 8 p.m. Under the House bill, the Federal Aviation
Administration would still set hourly limits based on the number of
flights air-traffic controllers can safely handle.
</P>
<P>
   A similar Senate bill, which was approved last month by the
Commerce Committee, would not eliminate the slot system but would
add 15 flights a day at O'Hare and 24 flights at Reagan National.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would add an unspecified number at Kennedy and
LaGuardia by giving the Department of Transportation greater
authority to grant exemptions to the slot rule. The DOT would also
be required to give exemptions to airlines operating 30- to 50-seat
regional jets that serve small- and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would also require so-called hub airports, in
which a large carrier often controls a majority of gates, to
increase competition in order to receive additional federal funds.
Delta Airlines, for example, controls 80 percent of the market in
Atlanta while Northwest controls 79 percent of the gates in its hub
airports of Minneapolis and Detroit, according the House
Transportation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's airline competition legislation would authorize more
funds for air traffic control facilities, airport security programs
and a general airport improvement program.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation was introduced in both houses last year. But
lawmakers representing districts near the slot-controlled airports
succeeded in killing it. Last month the new House Speaker, Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., said he supports airline competition legislation.

PITINO LOOKING FOR BETTER DEFENSE FROM CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With their three-game winning streak and brief journey
to the land of over .500 finished after losses to New Jersey and
Cleveland, the 6-7 Celtics return to the FleetCenter Friday for a
date with Denver and with a not-so-surprising request from their
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get our defense down,'' Rick Pitino said after
Thursday's film session and workout at Brandeis University in
Waltham. ``Our players don't understand this, well, maybe they do
understand this. They feel we don't have any shot blocking and
nobody's going to cover (down low) for us and that's a problem we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said Pitino, it's a problem that's not going to go away and
as a result, his team will have to adjust physically and mentally
to get out of their funk that began with a last-second loss to the
Nets on a Keith Van Horn shot that bounced high off the rim and
fell through to give New Jersey a 99-97 victory and continued with
a 116-99 blowout against a Cleveland team that had been struggling
offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to execute because we don't have any big men who are
going to help you out,'' said Pitino. ``If you get beat off the
dribble and you don't rotate perfectly, no one's going to be there
and that's what's frustrating them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pitino isn't quite as frustrated as his players. ``That's
the building process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics will have at least one advantage going for them
against the Nuggets. Denver played Thursday night in Miami, while
the Celtics were getting a little home cooking so Boston will be
more rested, a similar scenario to a week ago when the Knicks came
to town after playing the night before and were worn down by the
Celtics press in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is that the Nuggets have lost 6-foot-11-inch
center/forward Raef LaFrentz, their rookie from Kansas, for the
season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Before he went down,
LaFrentz led all rookies in rebounding (8.1 per game) and was third
in rookie scoring (14.9 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, said Pitino, the Celtics had better be ready for a
team that loves to shoot 3-pointers, can get to the free throw line
with its inside play, and has the league's reigning player of the
week in forward Antonio McDyess, who threw a career-high 46 points
in the faces of the Vancouver Grizzlies Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can shoot the 3-pointers from five spots,'' said Pitino,
running down the Denver roster. ``And three of their five guys
shoot the 3-pointer 50 percent of the time and they also go to the
line 30 times a game and shoot 78 percent. So they're either
shooting the 3 or going to the post and getting fouled or driving.
That's a pretty good philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   To offset that, the Celtics will have to help each other out
even more defensively, especially with the absence of an
intimidating big man in the middle. But even if they execute the
rotating defense, said Pitino, there's a danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you rotate, the more foul trouble you get into and
the reason we have to rotate so much is that we don't have great
interior defense. That's our Achilles' heel. But while we're
building, that's what we have to do, so we're working at making
sure that we don't get hurt too much on the perimeter while we're
in rotations.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino, his staff, and the players, who had a day off Wednesday,
had a chance to reflect on what went wrong the past couple of games
with a videotape session prior to Thursday's workout.

   ``I take any loss hard,'' said Pitino, ``but I didn't take the
Cleveland loss real hard because we didn't deserve to win. But when
you break down mentally like we did in the New Jersey game, that's
much harder to take.''

LAWMAKERS INTRODUCE AIRLINE COMPETITION LEGISLATION.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bill aimed at boosting airline competition by
lifting federal limits on the number of hourly landings and
takeoffs at airports in Chicago and New York City was introduced in
the House Thursday by a bipartisan group of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation
Committee, said removing the limits would ``immediately increase
competition in the airline industry'' by allowing additional
flights at three of the nation's busiest airports. Shuster's
committee is scheduled to vote on the legislation next week.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to constituents' complaints about the cost of flying
to and from small and medium-sized cities and about the quality of
airline service, lawmakers have recently introduced several bills
dealing with both issues.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's measure, which is supported by more than 120 lawmakers
from both parties, would eliminate so-called slots at Chicago's
O'Hare and New York's Kennedy and LaGuardia airports by next March
1. An additional three flights a day would be added at Washington,
D.C.'s Ronald Reagan National Airport. The slot system, which
refers to the number of daily landings and takeoffs, was
implemented at the four airports in 1968 to reduce delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``All airlines, big and small, new or old, will now be able to
serve Chicago O'Hare, or New York's LaGuardia and Kennedy,'' said
Rep. William Lipinski, D-Ill., one of the bill's authors.
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski said he believes that eliminating the slots will make
airlines more willing to serve small- and medium-sized cities
without having to worry about using ``their precious few slots (at
the four big airports) on the most profitable routes.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many additional flights would be allowed at
O'Hare, Kennedy and LaGuardia airports. House Transportation
Committee staffers said the three airports have capacity to add
flights.
</P>
<P>
   At O'Hare 155 landings and takeoffs are currently allowed per
hour, 68 are allowed at LaGuardia and 60 at Reagan National. At
Kennedy Airport 88 hourly landings and takeoffs are allowed between
3 p.m. and 8 p.m. Under the House bill, the Federal Aviation
Administration would still set hourly limits based on the number of
flights air-traffic controllers can safely handle.
</P>
<P>
   A similar Senate bill, which was approved last month by the
Commerce Committee, would not eliminate the slot system but would
add 15 flights a day at O'Hare and 24 flights at Reagan National.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would add an unspecified number at Kennedy and
LaGuardia by giving the Department of Transportation greater
authority to grant exemptions to the slot rule. The DOT would also
be required to give exemptions to airlines operating 30- to 50-seat
regional jets that serve small- and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would also require so-called hub airports, in
which a large carrier often controls a majority of gates, to
increase competition in order to receive additional federal funds.
Delta Airlines, for example, controls 80 percent of the market in
Atlanta while Northwest controls 79 percent of the gates in its hub
airports of Minneapolis and Detroit, according the House
Transportation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's airline competition legislation would authorize more
funds for air traffic control facilities, airport security programs
and a general airport improvement program.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation was introduced in both houses last year. But
lawmakers representing districts near the slot-controlled airports
succeeded in killing it. Last month the new House Speaker, Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., said he supports airline competition legislation.

TRADE GROUP PROPOSES BREAKING UP MICROSOFT, BUT NOT WINDOWS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's largest software-industry trade group has warned
the government not to impose sanctions on Microsoft that could
``fracture'' the role of the company's Windows operating system as
an industry standard, if the government wins its antitrust suit
against the Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But the report by the Software and Information Industry
Association, which was presented to the Justice Department two
weeks ago, does recommend that the government look seriously at
breaking up Microsoft as a cure for what the report regards as the
lack of competition in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   The report was confidential, though there are now more than 100
copies in the hands of industry executives, consultants and
academics, all of whom signed nondisclosure agreements. The
existence of the report and that it suggested options to
restructure Microsoft was reported Thursday in The Wall Street
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The group's paper suggests that the preferred restructuring
option, said an industry executive who had read the report, is a
break-up of Microsoft into three companies. The first of the trio
of stand-alone companies would get Microsoft's operating systems
business, including Windows, Windows CE and Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   The second would get its software applications, which include
its Word, Excel and Powerpoint productivity programs. The third
would get the Internet media and commerce businesses, ranging from
its Slate online magazine to its Expedia travel site.
</P>
<P>
   The reason this kind of break-up was ``an attractive
alternative,'' the executive said, was that it would alter
Microsoft's current relations with the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   At present, companies that compete with Microsoft in the
applications business also badly need the cooperation of Microsoft
to share its operating system technology if their products are to
run smoothly on Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the break-up into separate businesses would also leave the
Windows operating system in the hands of one company. The report
states that ``antitrust remedies should not interfere with an
apparent consumer preference for an OS standard,'' according to
people who have read the report.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the 40-page report focuses on the balanced
assessment of various remedial options instead of advocacy. It is
intended mainly as a way of giving the Justice Department and 19
states suing Microsoft the industry's perspective on what steps
seem workable.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which is a member of the trade group, objected to the
recent report _ as it has to previous position papers by the group
that have said curbing Microsoft's power would result in a
healthier software industry. A Microsoft spokesman said the
``discussion paper'' was largely the work of its rivals within the
trade organization, including Sun Microsystems and the Netscape
Communications Corp., and did not represent the views of the
software industry overall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report begins with seven broad principles. These include
avoiding ``punitive remedies'' and ensuring that remedies result in
``equitable access to operating system information'' and ``minimize
unnecessary dislocations to equity markets, shareholders and
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The report proceeds to assess 10 conduct remedies ranging from
prohibitions on bundling products and predatory pricing to
compulsory licensing of the Windows programming code. Finally, it
looks at the structural options.
</P>
<P>
   The group's conclusion, however, that it would be harmful to
allow several companies to compete with each other as Windows
suppliers does raise questions about two widely discussed remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The first such proposal is to break Microsoft into three to five
companies, each starting with the basic code for Windows and
Microsoft's other products. The proposed clone companies have
become known as the ``baby Bills,'' a reference to Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   A similar recommendation, favored by advisers to the states,
calls for an auction of the Windows programming code and the
Windows brand name to three to five companies. The reasoning behind
the auction proposal is that the monopoly position of Windows _ and
its potential for the abuse of market power _ could be broken up
without breaking up Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But one person who has read the report said it cautioned that
``deliberately fracturing'' the Windows standard could do more harm
than good by forcing consumers and software developers to grapple
with the confusion and cost of a handful of incompatible operating
systems.

LEWINSKY SWEEPS PUNCH MEETS ABC'S EXPECTATIONS _ AND MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky's carefully orchestrated campaign to cash in on
her notoriety is off to a blockbuster beginning.
</P>
<P>
   An average audience of 48.5 million Americans were planted in
front of their TV sets on Wednesday night as President Clinton's
ex-paramour bared her soul to Barbara Walters on ABC's ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, ABC estimated that 74 million viewers tuned in for at
least part of the interview, which the network claimed makes it the
most-watched ``news program'' ever televised by a single network.
As a launching pad for her new book, ``Monica's Story,'' Lewinsky
could scarcely have hoped for better. That is, of course, if people
liked the person they saw on TV and want to learn more about her _
a thoroughly open question.
</P>
<P>
   There were certainly no symptoms of Monica fatigue in Boston,
where more than half of those watching TV from 9 to 11 p.m.
Wednesday were tuned to the interview. In fact, ratings were higher
in the Boston viewing area _ which extends north to Concord, N.H.,
and west to Amherst in western Massachusetts _ than in any other TV
market in the country except Philadelphia. Nationally, nearly half
the TV sets in use were tuned to the ABC interview.
</P>
<P>
   So why the continued interest in a story whose bathos-filled
details have been endlessly rehashed for more than a year? In the
view of TV historian Steven Stark, the interviewer was as much of a
draw as her subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Monica-meets-Barbara Walters. If it had been Monica and
Mike Wallace, or Monica and Diane Sawyer, it wouldn't have been as
big a deal,'' said Stark. ``Barbara Walters is the defining force
in television news of the past 50 years. . . . She can always be
counted on to ask the questions that are on everybody's minds at
home, but most journalists would never ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Daniloff, director of the Northeastern University
School of Journalism, agreed that Walters handled the interview
with her usual skill, but said that doesn't diminish the fact that
Lewinsky was using it to ``push her book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She used the interview very well for her purposes,'' said
Daniloff. ``She has become very practiced; I assume that is a
result of the many interrogations she has been through. She
prepared a lot of her answers, until that time she broke down,
which was for me the most genuine and least rehearsed part of the
interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniloff said the ``invasion of privacy'' issues raised by the
interview made him queasy, but added: ``Clinton probably deserves
this. It's part of his punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The other networks are feeling Clinton's pain: Thanks to
Lewinsky, ABC drew more than three times as many viewers on
Wednesday night as runner-up NBC did. The Lewinsky interview, which
aired as a two-hour ``20/20'' special on the last night of the
February ratings sweeps period, ranks as the second-highest program
of the 1998-99 television season, behind only the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The average audience of 48.5 million viewers for Lewinsky far
outpaced the audience for Bill and Hillary Clinton in their 1992
``60 Minutes'' confessional; that drew only 34 million viewers even
though it aired right after the Super Bowl. Among celebrity
interviews this decade, it appears that only Oprah Winfrey's 1993
conversation with Michael Jackson on ABC, with 62 million viewers,
has racked up higher ratings than Lewinsky/Walters did, according
to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Lewinsky's ratings pale next to those of the
top-rated entertainment programs of all time. For instance, the
finale of ``M-A-S-H'' drew an average of 106 million viewers, the
``Cheers'' finale pulled in 80 million viewers, and the last
episode of ``Seinfeld'' was watched by 76 million.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when entertainment programs are factored in, the
Lewinsky interview does not even crack the top 100-rated programs
of television history.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not likely to trouble ABC or its affiliates as they
bask in the satisfaction of Lewinsky's lofty numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the interview got a 33.4 rating and a 48 audience
share. Such numbers are less and less common in an era when viewers
have dozens of cable channels to choose from on any given night.
Even when major news events occur, such as the O. J. Simpson
verdict or the death of Princess Diana, the audience is diffused
among many broadcast and cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare that a network has a monopoly on an event,'' said
Stark, likening the Lewinsky interview to such network-exclusive
events as the Olympics or the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that the Lewinsky interview contained the
drama of either, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any event, it probably didn't live up to the
expectations,'' said Stark. ``Monica Lewinsky's is not an earned
celebrity. . . . She's not terribly insightful. She really doesn't
have that much to say.''

`MONICA'S STORY': TAWDRY AND TIRESOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Monica's Story'' might well be called ``The Miseducation of
Monica Lewinsky.'' It's the story of how an emotionally needy young
woman sought to assuage her low self-esteem with eating binges and
affairs with unavailable men, and how her affair with an equally
needy and adolescent-minded man, who just happened to be the
president of the United States, threw this country into a tabloid
frenzy and the first impeachment trial in 131 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica's Story'' offers a narrative that will be all too
familiar to anyone who has read the Starr report or watched the
endless television spectacle over the last year. That narrative has
been fleshed out with scattered quotes from Ms. Lewinsky and
labored efforts to re-create her state of mind during encounters
with Clinton, with her former friend Linda Tripp and with the staff
of the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   It adds little to what has already been reported in the press or
revealed in this week's much-hyped ABC interview with Barbara
Walters, and it employs the much used and abused device of
omniscient narration, re-creating entire scenes with little
sourcing or attribution, sometimes extrapolating Ms. Lewinsky's
point of view into an objective truth.
</P>
<P>
   The author of this book, Andrew Morton, is best known for his
sympathetic books on Diana, Princess of Wales, who before Ms.
Lewinsky held the title of world's most famous and most
paparazzi-hounded woman. Though the princess was canonized as a
secular saint and Ms. Lewinsky has been reviled by some as a home
wrecker and hussy, there are similarities to their stories,
similarities that are consciously or unconsciously played up by
Morton.
</P>
<P>
   He portrays both of them as survivors of dysfunctional
childhoods, both as neurotics afflicted with eating disorders and
both as women who were unhappy in love. Ms. Lewinsky's entire life
(both before and after Clinton) is depicted as a series of
heart-stopping crises, nightmares and traumas, measured by Morton
in her ``gusts of tears'' and a fever chart of her continually
fluctuating weight.
</P>
<P>
   Like Morton's two Diana books (``Diana: Her True Story'' and
``Diana: Her New Life''), ``Monica's Story'' reverberates with the
cloying sound of the talk-show confessional. All three books also
share an annoying, and sometimes inadvertently amusing, propensity
for Gothic melodrama and romance-novel prose. Describing the hopes
of Ms. Lewinsky's mother and aunt that her infatuation with the
president was winding down, Morton writes, ``Over the next few
weeks, however, like blood seeping out from under a closed door,
the awful truth began to dawn.''
</P>
<P>
   And of the difficulty Ms. Lewinsky and the president had in
scheduling time together: ``It seemed that fate had its own means
of obstructing them, as well. Before they could meet, news of a
terrorist outrage in Israel, a serious threat to the fragile peace
between the Israelis and the Palestinians which Clinton had helped
to broker, meant that the President had to make an immediate public
statement. ... Monica's visit had to be canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Morton is concerned, public policy, politics and the
debate over impeachment have simply obscured a great and tragic
love story: a tale of star-crossed lovers, undone by their own
flaws and a cruel world. Ms. Lewinsky, he tells us, ``cried her
eyes out'' after seeing the movie ``Titanic'': ``The story of the
doomed love affair between two passengers from different social
classes and backgrounds touched a deep chord within her. It seemed
to parallel her own unfulfilled relationship with `Handsome,'
reminding her of the angst and anger she had endured during their
bittersweet affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton tries to present Ms. Lewinsky in this book not as a ditsy
Valley Girl or pushy tart but as a die-hard romantic who loves
roses and shabby chic furniture. Like Diana she is also depicted as
a long-suffering victim. Morton not only tells us about the real
pain she suffered in the wake of her parents' divorce, but he also
recounts Beverly Hills slights like not being invited to Tori
Spelling's birthday party and having to do without her own phone
line and Snoopy phone.
</P>
<P>
   Later, of course, she will be ``cruelly traduced by Linda Tripp,
by Kenneth Starr, by Bill Clinton and by the world's media.'' Ms.
Tripp is described as ``a latter-day Judas,'' a ``treacherous
friend'' with a ``lumpy figure,'' and ``the moon-faced'' Starr as a
virtual ``personification of the `Big Brother' of Orwell's
future.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky says at one point in the book that she thinks in
retrospect that the president ``should have shown more restraint
and left it as a flirtation and as an unacted upon fantasy,'' that
``it was too much of an emotional burden for someone my age.'' As
Morton sees it, Clinton did not simply use Ms. Lewinsky as a sexual
plaything but also harbored a ``much deeper need for this girl,''
who reminded him of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   This book suggests that the most powerful man on the planet
found a soul mate in the 20-something Monica Lewinsky. Both are
depicted as emotionally needy, both had unhappy childhoods, both
loved to eat (and sucked in their stomachs out of an embarrassment
about their weight), both were self-indulgent, and both had a
history of playing fast and loose with the truth. ``At times,''
Morton writes, ``he acted more like a lovesick teen-ager than the
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally disturbing is the scene Morton paints of Clinton burying
his pain over the death of an American serviceman in Bosnia by
indulging in a make-out session with Ms. Lewinsky. In another
incident Morton contends that Clinton became ``enthralled, actually
sexually aroused'' by Ms. Lewinsky's descriptions of her own visit
to Bosnia with the Defense Department in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If months of television talk show debates haven't already made
the reader weary of this whole tawdry affair and its surreal effect
on our public discourse, this book should certainly do it. Its
obsessive account of teen-age shenanigans, its tiresome prattling
about sex and self-esteem, its therapeutic jargon and Judith Krantz
prose sadly sum up the sorry state of affairs our culture has
reached, a state in which news and voyeurism, politics and soap
opera have inextricably blurred, where the personal is paramount
and D-Day no longer refers to World War II but to ``Dump Day'' in
the saga of Monica and Bill.

A NEW WAVE OF EUROPEANS IS SITTING TALL ON THE ROAD

(DW) 
 By WILLIAM DIEM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The sea change in the North American auto market in
favor of pickups, sport utilities and minivans is being reflected
in Europe, where vehicles are being designed with more spacious
interiors and higher seating. At major shows like the Geneva Motor
Show, which opens next week, it is clear that the European market
is moving from sedans and hatchbacks to a minivan-like shape known
as monospace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Georges Douin, vice president for product design at
Renault, traditional sedans and hatchbacks held 85 percent of the
European market in 1990 but fell to 70 percent in 1990. He expects
them to drop to 55 percent in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most emblematic of the shift is Renault's Megane Scenic,
a compact five-seat minivan. It arrived in force in 1997, and
275,000 Scenics were sold last year _ more than the combined sales
of the Megane hatchback, sedan and convertible models. The Scenic
made Megane the No. 2 nameplate in Western Europe after
Volkswagen's Golf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The compact minivan niche hardly existed in the region before
the Scenic. But last year, in the passenger car market of the 17
countries of Western Europe, the Scenic's compact minivan segment
grew to 3 percent. ``With all the product introductions, we expect
that by next year that segment will be 6 percent,'' said Colin
Couchman, an auto analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in London. ``And
it could really take off. People talk about it being the new
hatchback. Hatchbacks didn't exist until late 1970s, and they
replaced the sedan as the basic car.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not far behind the Scenic in influence is the Mercedes-Benz
A-Class, a luxury monospace in a class by itself. DaimlerChrysler
says the A-Class competes for the same customers who consider
buying the Golf, a traditional hatchback. The A-Class sold nearly
120,000 vehicles in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lump the A-Class in a segment with the Scenic,'' said Andrew
Blair-Smith, an auto analyst with Commerzbank in Frankfurt,
Germany. ``Something between a people mover and a car. It's not the
same, but it's not a million miles away in terms of the flexibility
of interior space.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year, two new compact minivans already have arrived: the
Mitsubishi Space Star, which is built in the Netherlands with
Volvo, and the droll-looking Fiat Multipla, with its two rows of
three seats. Sales start in April for the Opel/Vauxhall Zafira,
with its seven-seat option. By the end of the year, the Citroen
Picasso, a close copy of the Scenic, also will arrive. VW and Ford
are expected to introduce competitors later. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American contribution to monospace is DaimlerChrysler's PT
Cruiser, which arrives in Europe in summer 2000. When potential
customers were shown the car in Europe, the hot-rod panel van was
better received than in the United States, said Chris Theodore, a
former Chrysler vice president who is now with Ford Motor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fascination with higher seating is strikingly evident in
another DaimlerChrysler car, the Smart. Some 20,000 Smarts were
sold in nine European countries in 1998, and DaimlerChrysler
expects to sell 100,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   The miniature city car, which seats two, was designed for easy
parking. It is only 7 feet 4 inches long, but proportionally
speaking, it's a skyscraper at 4 feet 11 inches high. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In tests of high-speed maneuverability in 1997, the Smart tipped
over. The Mercedes A-Class, which also is relatively high for its
length, failed a similar test just weeks before, and Daimler did
not want to take any chances with small cars for which safety would
always be a question.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler halted delivery of the A-Class and delayed introduction
of the Smart six months, until October 1998. Engineers installed,
among other measures, electronic anti-skid devices that monitor the
wheels and selectively apply brakes.
</P>
<P>
   In North America, the sport utility craze reflects a Wild West
mentality, Peter Horberry, the chief designer at Volvo, said in an
interview at the Detroit auto show in January. ``It's a progression
from the covered wagon,'' he added. ``The driver sitting high up
there, all his horses in front of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The European approach is gentler. BMW's new X5 sport activity
vehicle was designed in the United States but developed in Germany,
where engineers and designers insisted on carlike refinements. ``I
wanted it raw and strong, more out there, not too smooth and
politically correct,'' said Chris Chapman, its American designer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, however, insisted on changes. For example, Chapman
wanted the C-pillar, the sheet metal behind the rear door, painted
in body colors because that is a visual design cue of trucklike
sport utilities. But body color on the C-pillar would have diverged
from a design cue shared by all BMW sedans; they are designed and
painted so that the side windows appear to be one large opening.
The Germans won.
</P>
<P>
   The X5 is built in South Carolina, and North America is seen as
its primary market, but it will be sold in Europe as well. Europe's
compact minivans, however, are not scheduled to be exported to
North America nor are the Smart and A-Class.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Europeans remain famous for low-slung sports cars
like Ferrari and conservative luxury vehicles like the
Mercedes-Benz S-Class, but a shift _ even at the upper end of the
market _ seems evident. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Renault is considered a European trend-setter. It introduced the
full-size minivan in Europe in 1983, about the same time Chrysler
introduced the Voyager in the United States. It introduced the
Twingo, a little monospace that now has competitors like the Ford
Ka. It invented the Scenic, and now it is trying to define the new
shape of luxury with the Avantime, a concept vehicle that will be
introduced to the public in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Renault calls its new shape the coupespace, a marriage of a
sporty coupe and a family minivan. The two-door vehicle with a
glass roof and four seats is expected to hit the showrooms in
spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is becoming less conventional,'' said Douin of
Renault. ``This shift away from classic cars will be to the
advantage of station wagons, four-by-fours and mid- and top-range
monospace designs.''

WALL STREET'S TURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that 900 women have rushed forward to complain
officially about job discrimination at Merrill Lynch, gender bias
on Wall Street is no longer the dirty little secret of high
finance.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpectedly large number of women who filed their claims as
part of a class action lawsuit settlement against the huge
securities firm has shaken an elite, closed world. Tom Wolfe
sarcastically described that world in his best-selling ``Bonfire of
the Vanities'' as peopled with highly flawed ``masters of the
universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch is a brokerage giant, with 715 offices nationwide.
Since 1990, the percentage of female brokers it employs has
remained a pitiful 15 percent, highly suggestive of a silent quota
system.
</P>
<P>
   This lawsuit is going to cost Merrill Lynch a great deal of
money in compensatory payments. More importantly, it may finally
provoke substantive changes in the male culture that controls the
brokerage establishment.
</P>
<P>
   If you have ever watched a televised scene on the stock market
floor, you understand the problem. Virtually all the participants
are male. Yet investors are not exclusively male. Working women
with their own incomes increasingly play the market too. Money is
gender-free, and the brokers with whom it is entrusted should be
too.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution began brewing last year when a similar case was
settled involving job bias at Smith Barney (now Salomon Smith
Barney). It exposed for the first time Wall Street's ignorance of
the usefulness of employee diversity, which most major corporations
in other fields have long ago acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Although women now account for roughly half of the securities
industry work force, few rise to the top jobs or earn the highest
incomes. The lawsuits indicate that this gender imbalance is not
the result of inferior female brainpower but systematic practices
that favor males with choice account assignments, higher salaries,
better management training opportunities and an old-boy network
that promotes its buddies.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking that produced this disparity centers on the
outdated stereotypical notion that men make great financial deals
while playing golf, but women would rather be home with their
babies than dealing with clients. Strangely, this attitude applies
to all women of all ages, whether they have babies or not.
</P>
<P>
   Women were told they didn't need salaries or client
opportunities equal to men's because they had husbands who could
support them _ and if they didn't have one, they should get one.
There was also the strong suggestion that money is a man's affair
and women simply can't add and subtract.
</P>
<P>
   The overdue assault on Wall Street elevates the struggle for
equal rights in the workplace to a new, higher level. We are truly
talking about the nuances of a sophisticated glass ceiling here,
not just equal pay on the assembly line. A successful broker can
earn $200,000 a year or more and bring in $2 million or more in
annual income to the firm.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of elitist issue from which only a privileged,
highly specialized few can benefit and with which not all women may
be eager to make common cause. Yet it is just as elementary to
gender equality as a more basic crusade for equal pay for
equivalent work currently being waged nationally by President
Clinton, organized labor and women's groups.
</P>
<P>
   The president called attention to the new campaign in his State
of the Union address, asking for more enforcement teeth in the
current equal pay laws. He got a standing ovation from both
Democrats and Republicans, hinting that legislation that gets
serious about ending wage discrimination for work of comparable
character may actually pass Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite decades of progress, women still tend to be clumped in
lower-paying, female-dominated jobs and earn, on average, 74
percent of the wages paid to men. The AFL-CIO, which has mounted a
nationwide campaign to pass comparable-worth bills in 24 states,
released a study showing that the average working family loses more
than $4,000 a year to the gender wage gap.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court will soon weigh in on the subject of job
discrimination, deciding how far it is legally permissible to
financially punish guilty employers. The high bench heard arguments
this week on the standards for granting punitive damages _ which
are the most effective way to make the bad guys really take notice.
</P>
<P>
   Gender pay equity for jobs that are similar but not exactly
alike can be tricky and distorted by political influence on both
sides. But working women are here to stay. And they want their fair
share of the action. If male executives won't give it to them,
women will take it anyway.

TEXAS BILL WOULD GIVE IN-STATE PATIENTS FIRST SHOT AT RECOVERED
ORGANS 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas would join a growing number of states
flouting new federal guidelines for organ transplants under a bill
filed Thursday by state Sen. Mario Gallegos.
</P>
<P>
   With the backing of prominent Houston transplant surgeons and
groups involved in organ donations, Gallegos' bill stipulates that
organs recovered in Texas be offered to in-state patients first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good system in Texas, we have worked hard to
increase organ donations,'' said Gallegos, D-Galena Park. ``If
Texas organs are spread around the country, many Texans may die
before other organs become available.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government last year announced new transplant
regulations to take effect Oct. 1. The guidelines call for sharing
organs nationally, with the sickest patients receiving the highest
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, organs are offered first to patients served by the
bank that collected the organ. If there is no match, organs are
shared regionally and then nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Medical advances have resulted in preserving organs longer and
flying them where needed most. However, several states now prohibit
sending organs out of state unless no in-state patient matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem is not how to allocate this limited supply of
organs, but that we need more organs,'' said Dr. Patrick Wood,
director of the Texas Liver Center at Hermann Hospital in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Wood and Dr. Michael DeBakey, chancellor emeritus of Baylor
College of Medicine and a pioneer in heart and transplant surgery,
are supporting Gallegos' bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shortage of viable donor organs makes it critical that
such tissues donated in Texas be offered to suitable candidates in
this state first,'' DeBakey said.
</P>
<P>
   Wood and others have said the new federal guidelines will force
patients to compete harder for the few, available organs. But
supporters of the guidelines claim the distribution process would
be more equitable, removing existing barriers for the neediest
recipients to obtain organs.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Holtzman, president of Houston's LifeGift Organ Donation
Center, said his organization exported about 35 percent of the
organs it collected last year to areas outside Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Creech, a heart transplant recipient from Houston, added,
``The donation rate in Texas is much higher than the national
average, and it would not be appropriate to send those organs to
areas doing not enough to increase the supply of organs.''
</P>
<P>
   Other states that have taken steps to protect their organ
supplies from export are Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kyle Janek, R-Houston, a physician, is filing a companion
bill to Gallegos' measure in the House. Decisions about Texas
transplants are better made by qualified medical professionals than
by ``politicians in Washington,'' Janek said.

LAWMAKERS BLAST MEXICO, WHITE HOUSE OVER DRUG CERTIFICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional critics on Thursday said President
Clinton's certification of Mexico as a cooperating ally in the war
on drugs is ``troubling,'' and they moved to overturn the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite a long and productive relationship with our ally to
the south _ Mexico _ the river of hard drugs is ending up on
America's streets and coming across the Mexican border,'' said Rep.
John L. Mica, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult for me to believe that this administration
would certify Mexico as fully cooperating. This is troubling,''
said Mica, chairman of the House Government Reform subcommittee on
drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Feb. 26 certified to Congress that Mexico is a fully
cooperating drug-fighting ally. Congress has 30 days from that date
to overturn the president's decision.
</P>
<P>
   A challenge to Mexico's certification is being mounted by
Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate, although most
lawmakers agree that the effort is unlikely to overturn Clinton's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has
instructed Mica and other Republican leaders in the House to move
forward with a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reps. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., and Clay Shaw, R-Fla.,
have introduced legislation that would strip Mexico of
certification. And Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Paul
Coverdell, R-Ga., have proposed a ban on business dealings with
foreign companies that serve as fronts for drug cartel smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Constantine, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration,
told Mica's subcommittee that drug kingpins in Mexico are
responsible for moving two-thirds of the cocaine consumed into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   And although those narcotics kings are well known by the
authorities on both sides of the border, ``they have been able to
evade arrest and prosecution'' in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is pervasive in Mexican law enforcement ranks,
allowing drug cartels to grow stronger and branch out into
production and smuggling of methamphetamines and heroin,
Constantine said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary of State Rand Beers said Mexico and the
United States admit that problems exist with drug-interdiction
efforts south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   But, Beers said, the president weighed the extent of Mexico's
efforts to combat illegal narcotics trafficking and the country's
attitude toward drug smuggling before certifying Mexico as a
partner in fighting illicit narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Decertification, which could strip Mexico of U.S. aid, would
``jeopardize any cooperative efforts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The certification process, mandated by law, requires that the
United States decertify countries that do not cooperate with
American antidrug efforts. Decertified countries are often hit with
economic penalties such as loss of U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   Congress can overturn Clinton's decision by a majority vote in
both chambers within 30 days. But in the 13 years that the process
has been in effect, lawmakers have never reversed an administration
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 28 nations considered for certification this year, 26
were certified, including Colombia, which failed to make the list
in 1996 and 1997. Afghanistan and Burma were not certified, the
Clinton administration said, because the two nations produce more
than 90 percent of the world's supply of opium poppy.
</P>
<P>
   Mica said Mexico is responsible for the drugs and violence
``destroying young lives at a record level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, no country in the world poses a more
immediate drug threat to the United States,'' he said.

BLACKMUN, AUTHOR OF ABORTION RULING, DIES AT AGE 90 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trims) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun,
whose landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion ignited a
still-raging national debate, died Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun, 90, who served on the court from 1970 to 1994, died in
Arlington, Va., from complications after hip-replacement surgery
Feb. 23, the Supreme Court announced.
</P>
<P>
   The former justice will be remembered as the author of Roe vs.
Wade, the high court's controversial ruling that women have a
constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy during its first
trimester.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his renown as the ``author of the abortion
decision'' 10 years later, Blackmun repeated the phrase slowly and
said: ``We all pick up tabs. I'll carry this one to my grave.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton referred approvingly to Roe vs. Wade on
Thursday as he praised Blackmun for having served on the court with
``compassion, distinction and honor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see his mind and heart at work in the landmark
decision he wrote protecting women's right to reproductive freedom
and in his decisions to make the promise of civil rights actually
come alive in the daily existence of the American people,'' Clinton
said. ``He did justice and he loved mercy and now he walks humbly
with his God.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who opposes the decision,
nevertheless had nothing but praise for Blackmun upon his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a worthy successor to the predecessors in the seat
which he occupied,'' Rehnquist wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, another ardent opponent of the Roe
decision, also hailed his former colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was more dedicated to the rule of law or more
painstaking in the execution of his responsibilities on this court
than Harry Blackmun,'' Scalia wrote. ``He was a good man and a good
justice, deserving the respect of all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   President Nixon nominated Blackmun, then a federal appeals court
judge in Minnesota, to the high court April 14, 1970 _ after the
Senate rejected Nixon's first two conservative choices for the
bench, Clement F. Haynsworth Jr. and G. Harrold Carswell. Blackmun
never forgot that he was a third choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always kept me a little on the humble side to know that
there are other factors in life rather than I being the first
selection, which I was not,'' Blackmun said in a 1995 interview.
</P>
<P>
   In taking his seat on the court June 9, 1970, Blackmun joined
his childhood friend from Minnesota, Chief Justice Warren Burger.
The press quickly dubbed them the ``Minnesota Twins'' because they
often voted along the same conservative lines in ruling for the
government in law-and-order and welfare-related cases.
</P>
<P>
   But Blackmun's reputation as a conservative quickly changed
after a pregnant Dallas woman, Norma McCorvey, challenged an 1854
Texas law that made it illegal to perform an abortion. McCorvey,
referred to in court papers as Jane Roe, argued through lawyer
Sarah Weddington of Austin that the Texas statute and similar
anti-abortion laws in most states violated the constitutional right
to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In his Roe vs. Wade decision Jan. 22, 1973, Blackmun wrote,
``The Constitution nowhere mentions a specific right of personal
choice in matters of marriage and family life, but the liberty
protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
covers more than those freedoms explicitly named in the Bill of
Rights. That right necessarily includes the right of a woman to
decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston lawyer Keith Ellison, who clerked for Blackmun during
the high court's 1977-78 term, remembered the former justice as ``a
private man of extraordinary rectitude.'' Blackmun ``did not choose
to be the epicenter of the abortion debate,'' Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He simply decided a case that the Constitution required him to
decide and wrote an opinion that the chief justice asked him to
write,'' Ellison added. ``He never doubted that it was a difficult
decision about which honorable people could and would disagree. He
paid a horrific price for a role he never sought, but which his
conscience would not allow him to avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University law Professor Laurence Tribe, who argued more
than 20 cases before Blackmun, said what he will remember most
about the justice was his change from a conservative to one of the
court's last liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe noted Blackmun's change of heart on the death penalty,
which he supported until he had a public change of heart shortly
before his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was tone deaf on issues of poverty,'' Tribe said, referring
to Blackmun's initial decisions. But over time the justice came to
realize ``there is a world out there with people who don't have
power and resources,'' Tribe added.
</P>
<P>
   The professor also remembered Blackmun as a gentle questioner of
lawyers, asking primarily factual questions about how the case
proceeded in lower courts rather than hypothetical inquiries about
how the law would apply. But Tribe said Blackmun ``could get quite
ferocious'' in grilling lawyers who dared to argue in favor of
weakening Roe vs. Wade.

</P>
<P>
   Kathy Rodgers, executive director of the National Organization
for Women Legal Defense and Education Fund, cited his 1991 decision
that women of child-bearing age may work in areas that might harm
fetuses as evidence of his championship of civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun wrote for a divided court that a woman, not her
employers, must decide whether she wants to work in a dangerous
environment. ``Justice Blackmun will be remembered as a forceful
champion of women's rights and a defender of individual liberty,''
Rodgers said.
</P>
<P>
   But David O'Steen, executive director of the National Right to
Life Committee, said he holds the former justice in a different
regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``History will remember Harry Blackmun as the architect of the
tragic U.S. Supreme Court decision Roe vs. Wade,'' O'Steen said.
``It is a tragedy for someone to go to his grave best remembered
for denying unborn children the most basic civil liberty _ the
right to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Andrew Blackmun was born Nov. 12, 1908, in Nashville,
Ill., but was raised in St. Paul, Minn. After earning his
bachelor's and law degrees from Harvard University, he returned to
his hometown in 1932 and spent a year as a law clerk for 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals Judge John B. Sanborn.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun then joined the Minneapolis law firm Dorsey, Colman,
Barker, Scott &AMP; Barber, where he specialized in tax and probate
law. In 1950, he left the firm to become general counsel of the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Blackmun to the 8th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1959. Blackmun remained on the
appeals court until Nixon picked him to fill the vacancy left when
Justice Abe Fortas resigned.
</P>
<P>
   After Blackmun retired from the court Aug. 3, 1994, Clinton
chose Stephen G. Breyer to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun is survived by his wife, Dorothy, whom he married in
1941; three daughters, Nancy, of Framingham, Mass, and Sally and
Susan, of Orlando, Fla.; and five grandchildren
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements have not been announced.

HARRY A. BLACKMUN, 90; WROTE DECISION LEGALIZING ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Retired Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun, author of the
court's 1973 opinion in Roe v. Wade which legalized abortion
nationwide, died early Thursday in Arlington, Va. He was 90. The
cause of death was complications following a hip-replacement
operation on Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, President Clinton hailed Justice Blackmun's
``uncanny feel for the human element that lies just beneath the
surface of all serious legal argument'' and noted that ``In 24
years on the Supreme Court, he served with compassion, distinction
and honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Blackmun was an associate justice from 1970 to 1995. At
the time of his retirement, he was 85, the third-oldest man to
serve on the court, after Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who retired at
90, and Chief Justice Roger Taney, who died at 87.
</P>
<P>
   Long before he retired, Justice Blackmun had become a liberal
hero. Many observers attributed his leftward shift to the attacks
he suffered as the author of Roe. Justice Blackmun himself always
said that he hadn't gotten more liberal, but rather the court had
gotten more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of cause, his defense of abortion rights, opposition
to the death penalty, and commitment to civil liberties were not
the attributes of the man President Richard M. Nixon hailed as a
``strict constructionist'' when he named Blackmun to the court.
</P>
<P>
   That Justice Blackmun was one of three dissenters when the court
ruled in 1971 in the so-called ``Pentagon Papers'' case that the
government could not prevent The New York Times from publishing a
secret Defense Department history of US involvement in Indochina.
That Harry Blackmun remained recognizable two years later in an
opinion in a case concerning a welfare recipient unable to file a
$50 bankruptcy fee. Paying the fee on the installment plan ``should
be within his able-bodied reach,'' Justice Blackmun wrote, in a
statement some observers considered callous. Yet a mere four years
later, he declared in a dissent on a court ruling against abortion
funding, ``There is another world `out there,' the existence of
which the court, I suspect, either chooses to ignore or fears to
recognize.. . . This is a sad day for those who regard the
Constitution as a force that would serve justice to all
evenhandedly and, in so doing, would better the lot of the poorest
among us.''
</P>
<P>
   What may well have been Justice Blackmun's most ringing
statement of liberal jurisprudence came during his final year on
the bench in his dissent from a court refusal to hear the appeal of
a death row inmate. ``From this day forward, I no longer shall
tinker with the machinery of death,'' Justice Blackmun declared.
``I feel morally and intellectually obligated simply to concede
that the death penalty experiment has failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Blackmun liked to jokingly refer to himself as ``Old
Number Three.'' He was named to the court only after the Senate had
rejected two previous Nixon nominees to the seat that had been held
by Justice Abe Fortas: US Appellate judges Clement Haynsworth and
G. Harrold Carswell. Nixon appointed Justice Blackmun at the urging
of Chief Justice Warren Burger, a longtime friend. The two were
immediately dubbed the ``Minnesota Twins'' (a tribute to their
native state). Burger proved to be the predictably conservative
justice Nixon had hoped for. Justice Blackmun, however, resented
Burger's taking his vote for granted and soon demonstrated his
judicial independence.
</P>
<P>
   It was Burger who assigned the Roe opinion to Blackmun. ``I
still think it was a correct decision,'' Justice Blackmun said in
an interview on the occasion of Roe's 10th anniversary. ``We were
deciding a constitutional issue, not a moral one.''
</P>
<P>
   The opinion won Justice Blackmun the intense admiration of
liberals and feminists. Norman Dorsen, former president of the
American Civil Liberties Union, spoke for many when in a 1985
article he called the decision ``famous as a human charter of
liberty for women who wish to control their lives and reproductive
destinies.'' Thursday, Gloria Feldt, president of Planned
Parenthood, hailed Justice Blackmun as ``a great humanitarian _ a
true 20th-century hero who will be remembered well into the next
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   It also won him the equally intense enmity of abortion
opponents. Public appearances by the justice invariably drew
pickets. Among the epithets hurled at him, he once recalled, were
``butcher of Dachau, murderer, Pontius Pilate, King Herod _ you
name it.'' Ten years after the decision, he was still receiving
eight to 10 letters a day. ``Some are very supportive, very lovely
messages,'' he explained. ``But most are very abusive. The more
recent ones are as abusive as initial ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The one area where Justice Blackmun's Roe opinion tended to
inspire unanimity was among legal scholars, many of whom agreed
with its result but very few with its often tortured reasoning. A
slow writer, Justice Blackmun was affectionately called ``Fast
Harry'' by his clerks, and the combination of his lack of fluency
and the complexity of the subject made for an unsatisfactory
opinion. As Georgetown University law professor Mark Tushnet once
wrote in the Harvard Law Review, ``It seems to be generally agreed
that, as a matter of simple craft, Justice Blackmun's decision for
the Court was dreadful.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Blackmun remained both proud and protective of Roe. When
the court came as close as it ever has to overturning the decision,
in its 1989 ruling in Webster v. Reproductive Human Services,
Justice Blackmun concluded his dissent with an almost-shocking
directness. ``For today, the women of this nation still retain the
liberty to control their destinies. But the signs are evident and
ominous, and a chill wind blows.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, when the court affirmed Roe in Planned
Parenthood v. Casey, it became even clearer how personally Justice
Blackmun had come to feel about Roe. ``I am 83 years old,'' he
wrote in a concurring opinion. ``I cannot remain on this court
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Andrew Blackmun was born on Nov. 12, 1908, in Nashville,
Ill., the son of Corwin Manning Blackmun and Theo (Reuter)
Blackmun. The Blackmuns soon moved to St. Paul, Minn., where one of
Justice Blackmun's schoolmates was Burger. The two delivered
newspapers and played tennis together; some years later, Justice
Blackmun was best man at Burger's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   He was graduated summa cum laude in mathematics from Harvard in
1929 and three years later earned his law degree there. After a
year clerking for US Appellate Judge John Sanborn, whose seat he
would later fill, Justice Blackmun practiced law at a large
Minneapolis firm until 1950. That year, he became legal counsel to
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. His medical background would
later be cited as a key influence on the Roe opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Justice
Blackmun to the US Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. During the
11 years before his ascent to the high court, Justice Blackmun
earned a reputation for being moderately liberal in civil rights
and civil liberties cases and moderately conservative in criminal
justice cases. Perhaps because of his mathematical background, he
excelled at tax cases (a talent that his Supreme Court colleagues
came to particularly value because, as Justice William J. Brennan
Jr. put it, in that field ``the rest of us are so stupid'').
</P>
<P>
   Justice Blackmun leaves his wife, Dorothy, three daughters,
Nancy, Sally, and Susan, and five grandchildren.

ELIZABETH DOLE TO FORM COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elizabeth Dole, ending weeks of uncertainty that
had concerned many supporters, will announce Wednesday in Iowa that
she is forming a presidential campaign exploratory committee, her
aides said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement will be followed by television commercials in
Iowa, which holds the first caucus, and New Hampshire, which holds
the first primary, in which the former head of the American Red
Cross will lay out the rationale for her possible candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She feels tremendously confident about the support she has
seen out there,'' said Dole spokeswoman Joyce Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   It had been expected since Elizabeth Dole appeared before the
Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce in New Hampshire last month
that she would form an exploratory committee. But doubts about her
bid began to surface a week ago in political circles. New Hampshire
supporters became particularly concerned that she was losing an
opportunity to raise money as Texas Governor George W. Bush
prepares to file papers Monday for an exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Dole finalized plans Thursday for two key hires. Tom Daffron,
former top chief of staff to Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee and
a former senior vice president of the Baltimore Orioles, will be
her campaign manager. Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the House Ways
and Means Committee, will be the communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Stevens, a political consultant who worked for Bob Dole's
1996 presidential campaign, said Elizabeth Dole would be ``a
terrific candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this sort of silly and snobbish intelligentsia that
criticizes her for aspects of her personality,'' Stevens said.
``They say she is scripted, she likes to be prepared, that she
doesn't like to go into situations unless she understands all the
elements. These are not bad things for someone running for
president.''

GORDON C. MCKIBBEN, GLOBE EDITOR WHO RETOOLED BUSINESS COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Gordon C. McKibben, the architect of The Boston Globe's
modern business coverage, died Wednesday at his home in Lexington
after a bout with cancer. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Hired as business editor of the newspaper in 1980, Mr. McKibben
remade the Globe's financial section. He expanded the staff,
boosted coverage, and pushed the paper to write about subjects like
computers and biotechnology that previously had been mostly
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the business section, he went to London as
European correspondent, then returned to Boston to take up the
ombudsman's post at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the finest editors I ever knew and a superb
human being,'' said William O. Taylor, retired publisher of the
Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McKibben had a long and distinguished career in journalism
before he came to the Globe. He spent several years with the Wall
Street Journal in Los Angeles before moving to Business Week, his
employer for 17 years. At Business Week he covered everything from
the young Muhammad Ali to Canadian politics to the growing
technology industry along Route 128 in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   At the Globe, Mr. McKibben made his mark both professionally and
personally. Said John S. Driscoll, a former editor of the paper,
``Gordon had a special quality that was unmatched: the
professionalism of a veteran and the inquisitiveness and enthusiasm
of a cub reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   As a writer at the Globe, Mr. McKibben reported on the collapse
of the Soviet bloc. He also produced a series of stories on the
Arctic _ the kind of adventure he thrived on.
</P>
<P>
   And as the ombudsman _ the readers' representative inside the
Globe _ Mr. McKibben came into daily contact with a wide range of
readers. He used his biweekly column to explain to them the inner
workings of the newspaper's operations and, when he felt it
necessary, to offer hiw own opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McKibben didn't slow down in retirement. With Gillette's
cooperation, he produced a history of the company called ``The
Cutting Edge,'' which was published last year by Harvard Business
School Press. The book will be translated into Chinese and Thai
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McKibben was an active member of the Hancock United Church
of Christ in Lexington, a longtime member of the Lexington
Bicentennial Band flute section, and a volunteer in a Lexington
group that provided free rides for people who had to go to doctors'
appointments. An outdoorsman, he took his sons and brother in 1995
on a 100-mile hike around Mt. Rainier in Washington, retracing a
trip he had made when he was 15.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McKibben earned his bachelor's degree at Stanford University
and a master's degree in political science from the University of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Peggy; two sons, William E. of Johnsburg,
N.Y., and Thomas G. of Freeport, Maine; two brothers, William T. of
Grinnell, Iowa, and Ernest C. Jr. of Redmond, Wash., a sister,
Helena Kirkwood of Whidby Island, Wash.; and two grandchildren.

IBM, DELL ANNOUNCE PARTS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what is believed to be the biggest supply deal ever between
computer companies, IBM Corp. scored a major coup Thursday with the
announcement that Dell Computer Corp. will purchase up to $16
billion in IBM parts over the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will also cooperate on the development of new
computer technologies that will help Dell gain development
expertise and offer more advanced computers.
</P>
<P>
   Through the supply arrangement, Dell will get a reliable source
for state-of-the-art hard drives, flat panel screens , networking
equipment and advanced chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it plays to the strength of each company,'' said Jim
Newmann, spokesman for IBM's technology group. ``We see this as a
mutually beneficial relationship that takes an existing
relationship to a new level.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell already uses IBM parts in its computers. Texas-based Dell
is the world leader in ``build-to-order'' machines purchased by
phone and over the Internet. Although Dell is one of the world's
largest computer companies, with $18.2 billion in revenues in the
past four quarters, the company is basically an assembler of parts
made by other firms, and develops little original technology on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Dell has aggressively moved into the high end of the
computer market, selling advanced servers for use by major
companies. Dell must compete with giants like Compaq Computer
Corp., which spent $4.6 billion in research and development in
1998, including the activities of the former Digital Equipment
Corp, which Compaq acquired last year for $9.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, on the other hand, is one of the world's leading developers
of advanced computer hardware. Among its latest developments are
chips that use copper circuitry instead of the traditional
aluminum, for faster, cooler performance. The company makes some of
the most advanced drives. Later this year, IBM will introduce a
drive for laptops measuring one inch square and capable of storing
340 megabytes of data. IBM also is a major manufacturer of
high-quality liquid crystal display panels.
</P>
<P>
   ``By more extensively pairing IBM's world-class technology with
our own, in systems brought to market through our efficient direct
business model, we intend to enhance Dell's competitiveness in the
global computer systems industry,'' said Mike Lambert, senior vice
president of Dell's enterprise systems group.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is not exclusive, so Dell will be free to shop for
parts from other suppliers. Dell spokesman Jerele Neeld said his
firm will continue to seek bids from major disk drive suppliers
such as Maxtor Corp. and Seagate Technology Inc. The company will
also keep buying from other suppliers of networking hardware, such
as 3Com Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   And the deal will not affect Dell's long-term commitment to use
microprocessor chips from Intel Corp. IBM makes a line of
Intel-compatible chips. Nearly every other major computer company
now uses non-Intel processors in at least some of their computers.
But Dell remains firmly in the Intel camp.
</P>
<P>
   However, IBM technology group vice president Dave Ernsberger
said that Dell and IBM may work together on custom chips for use in
personal digital devices similar to 3Com's popular Palm Pilot. Dell
doesn't presently make such devices, but Ernsberger said that might
change as pocket-sized computers grow in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Chu, an analyst with SG Cowen in Boston, said that Dell
is looking to secure early access to the latest hardware
technologies. He also noted that the deal gives Dell a highly
reliable supply of crucial parts, at a time when many Asian parts
makers are trying to bolster prices by cutting their output.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may seem like there's endless capacity out there,'' said
Chu, ``but being able to establish a high-level commitment on key
technologies...is tactically a smart thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM was up 4 1/4 to 171 on the New York Stock Exchange,
contributing to the overall rise in the stock market Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dell stock closed up 15/16 at 81 7/8 on the Nasdaq stock
exchange.

STAPLES REPORTS HIGHER EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Joining the list of retailers that have beat Wall Street's
expectations, Staples Inc. said Thursday fourth-quarter profits
increased a whopping 45 percent to $101 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to deliver industry-leading financial
performance,'' said Staples chairman and chief executive Thomas G.
Stemberg, commenting on company sales that rose 23 percent to $2.1
billion, and sales at stores open at least a year that jumped 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cooking _ as usual,'' said PaineWebber analyst Aram
Rubinson. Of the three office-supply superstore chains, Office
Depot Inc., OfficeMax Inc., and Staples &UR;  &LR; is ``the best in its
class,'' Rubinson said.
</P>
<P>
   A strong economy and free spending by consumers during the
holiday shopping period made the fourth quarter a memorable one for
many retailers.
</P>
<P>
   But Staples once again outpaced the pack, showing signs of
strength in nearly all areas of its business, including its chain
of 913 superstores, its catalog sales, and its contract sales to
larger companies.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year that ended Jan. 30, sales rose 24 percent,
from $5.7 billion to $7.1 billion. Staples completed two
acquisitions during the year, but most of the sales increase came
from organic growth. Profits for the year grew 39 percent to $238
million.
</P>
<P>
   In other announcements, Staples said its board of directors has
authorized the Westborough, Mass. company to purchase up to $200
million worth of its common stock over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Staples also announced that it has completed the $140 million
purchase of -Claricom Holdings Inc., a Milford, Conn. company that
provides telecommunications services and products to small and
mid-size businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Staples announced its plan to buy Claricom in December.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on CNN, Stemberg said the company's on-line
retail operation, Staples.com, has gotten off to a good start since
its fall launch.
</P>
<P>
   The average order size from on-line purchasers is larger than
the average order size made from catalogs, Stemberg said.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any softness in Thursday's report, it was that
Staples' overseas operations have yet to perform as well as its US
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Staples bought the Quill Corp., the $600 million
marketer of office supplies directly to businesses. Plans call for
Quill to enter the European market within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Nasdaq, shares of Staples rose 1/2 to close at 28 1/2.

RETAILERS ENJOY A GOOD FEBRUARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A time for clearing out leftover winter merchandise for some
retailers, February was generally another good month as consumers
continued to spend freely at discount stores.
</P>
<P>
   And even some stores that posted mediocre results were singing a
happy tune: slow sales are a result of having nothing left to clear
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again we're seeing the continuation of a trend as
consumers shift their dollars to discount chains'' and offprice
retailers such as TJX Cos., said Kurt Barnard, president of
Barnard's Retail Trend Report.
</P>
<P>
   Discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kmart Corp. had
``superlative results'' in February, while many department stores
had sales gains only in ``the low single digits,'' Barnard said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, discounters seemed to take business away
from such department-store chains as Sears, Roebuck and Co. and
J.C. Penney Co.; both posted lackluster February sales.
</P>
<P>
   But as a result of strong housing sales, many retailers that
sell home furnishings and consumer electronics are faring well.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel chains including The Limited Inc., Gap Inc., and
AnnTaylor Stores Corp. also reported a good February.
</P>
<P>
   Observers such as Barnard focus on so-called same-store sales _
sales at stores open for at least one year; this, they claim, is
the best barometer of a retailer's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News, which compiles a monthly index of same-store
sales based on results from a wide range of retailers, said
same-store sales were up a better-than-expected 7.6 percent in
February, compared with February of 1998. Sales have now exceeded
estimates for five months in a row, Bloomberg said.
</P>
<P>
   One locally based retailer that beat that average was TJX of
Framingham, Mass. The operator of such chains as T.J. Maxx and
Marshalls said same-store sales were up a whopping 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ames Department Stores Inc., a regional discount chain based in
Rocky Hill, Conn., said February same-store sales were up 9.7
percent, thanks to strong sales of furniture, appliances, and home
entertainment merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers argue that seemingly poor February numbers can be
a reflection of strength. If merchandise sells out at a full price
during the holidays, then there's little left over to promote as
part of February clearance sales.
</P>
<P>
   At Talbots Inc. in Hingham, Mass., February performance ``was
impacted by significantly less fall clearance merchandise versus
the previous year,'' said president and chief executive Arnold B.
Zetcher, explaining a 7.1-percent slump in February same-store
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Initial consumer response to the spring line of the chain's
classic women's apparel has been positive, he added.
</P>
<P>
   At J. Baker Inc., the Canton, Mass. company said ``significantly
less clearance merchandise'' at its flagship Casual Male Big &AMP; Tall
chain was partly responsible for a February same-store sales gain
of only 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Federated Department Stores Inc., which operates the Macy's
chain, said February same-store sales were up only 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Federated noted that a popular annual home sale has been
moved from February to January, skewing February results.
</P>
<P>
   When the two months are combined, sales were up 3.6 percent
compared with the same two months in 1998, Federated said.
</P>
<P>
   Designs Inc. of Needham, Mass. has been struggling of late. Its
stores rely heavily on clothing made by Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., which
has been in a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Designs said same-store sales were up 8 percent for February
on a much smaller store base, 79 stores in February versus 113
stores for February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, the company has closed many underperforming
stores. With Levi's sales now showing signs of ticking upward, a
lean-and-mean Designs said it hopes 1999 will be a much better
year.

143,000 STUDENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR VOUCHERS UNDER TEXAS BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Texas) 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ An estimated 143,000 public school students in
the state's six most populous counties would be eligible to receive
tax-backed vouchers to transfer to private schools under a bill
unveiled Thursday by the Senate Education Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters predicted that only a small fraction of the eligible
students would actually take advantage of the five-year trial
program, which is backed by Gov. George W. Bush and Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents, including most of the public education
establishment, warned it would hurt the public schools by draining
away much-needed tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also said the bill would encourage parents to urge
their children to deliberately fail the Texas Assessment of
Academic Skills test to get a chance to go to private school.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation (Senate Bill 10), only low-income students
who weren't already enrolled in private schools and who failed the
most recent administration of the reading, writing or math TAAS
would be eligible for vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   That means the program would apply only to students in the
fourth grade or higher because the TAAS test is first administered
in the third grade.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Education Chairman Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, admitted he
was trying to address one of the Legislature's most controversial
issues.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't know who was right but was trying to ``test
educational theories which are fiercely debated in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bivins' bill _ which uses the term ``public education
scholarships'' instead of ``vouchers'' _ would require voucher
students to continue taking the TAAS tests in private schools and
require the state education commissioner to hold private schools
accountable for student performance.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Republicans Bush and Perry advocated a pilot voucher
program that would have been open to any low-income student from a
low-performing school or district in an urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins changed the plan to counter criticism that the proposal
would strip poor school districts of their best students. His bill
would apply only to low-performing, low-income students in any
school district in Bexar, Dallas, El Paso, Harris, Tarrant and
Travis counties.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins, using Texas Education Agency estimates, said that
143,000 students would be eligible. But Chuck McDonald, a spokesman
for Putting Children First, a pro-voucher group, said only 5
percent to 10 percent of eligible children have participated in
voucher programs in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said the average voucher would be worth about $4,000 a
year, and private or parochial schools accepting vouchers would be
prohibited from charging any more than the voucher amount for
tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Students with special needs, such as special education students,
could receive more money.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said a student's voucher would be equal to 80 percent of
the total amount of state and local public school funding for that
student's education. The school district the student is leaving
would keep the remaining 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The senator disputed charges that the bill would drain money
from the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the student moved away or transferred, the entire amount
would be gone. Under my proposal, the public school ends up with
more money per student for the remaining students,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said he had a ``reasonable chance'' of passing the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just honing my persuasive skills,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Boyle, a spokeswoman for the Coalition for Public
Schools, which includes the PTA and teachers' and school
administrators' groups fighting vouchers, said she believed
opponents had enough votes in the Senate to block the measure.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, Perry and other supporters of the bill are
``working it very hard.'' Two voucher advocates helped guarantee a
$1.1 million loan that Perry used to finance the closing days of
his campaign last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Under Senate rules, one-third of the senators, or 11 members,
can block debate on any bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a mess. It's a bad idea. Texans can't afford to
experiment with a bad idea,'' Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jimmy Mansour, an Austin businessman and chairman of Putting
Children First, said that vouchers will work and that ``Texans will
see that choice and accountability are good for our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Private and parochial schools accepting state vouchers would
have to be accredited or be in the process of seeking accreditation
from an organization recognized by the state education
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Private schools would be prohibited from accepting students on
the basis of race, ethnic background, religion, area of residence
or academic achievement. And schools couldn't consider athletic
ability in the admissions process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no cherry picking, as some people have referred
to it,'' Bivins said.
</P>
<P>
   A private school that had more voucher applicants than available
positions would have to give priority to students at risk of
dropping out of school and then fill any remaining positions by
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Low-income students would be defined as those participating in
the free and reduced-price lunch program.
</P>
<P>
   The state education commissioner, under the bill, could suspend
a private school from the voucher program if he determined the
school was low performing _ based on TAAS scores, attendance and
dropout rates of voucher students.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Scripps Howard Texas Poll indicated that Texans are
about evenly divided on the pilot voucher proposal but that support
for the idea is slipping.
</P>
<P>
   The concept also is creating controversy in other states.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew has threatened to
resign if Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani pushes through an experimental
voucher program, The New York Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At least two other voucher bills have been filed in the Texas
House, but Bivins' measure will get the most attention, at least
initially.
</P>
<P>
   One voucher advocate, who asked not to be named, said chances
were slim to none for getting a voucher bill out of the Texas House
Public Education Committee or getting one set for House floor
debate by the House Calendars Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Voucher proponents, however, could attempt to attach their bill
as an amendment during floor debate on another educational measure.
Such an attempt failed on a tie vote in the House two years ago.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Justice Harry A. Blackmun, a modest midwestern
Republican who became a passionate defender of the right to
abortion during 24 years on the Supreme Court, died Thursday at the
age of 90.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun, who retired from the court five years ago, died of
complications following hip replacement surgery, the court
announced. He underwent the procedure last week, following a fall
at his home in suburban Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In his retirement, he was a frequent visitor to the court, where
staff members and former law clerks helped celebrate his 90th
birthday in November. He made his movie debut in 1997, playing a
cameo role as Justice Joseph Story in the Stephen Spielberg film
``Amistad.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun was well aware that despite an active, 62-year career
as a lawyer and judge, his name would be forever linked to the
issue of abortion and to the opinion that bore his signature, Roe
vs. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   When Harry Blackmun took his seat on the Supreme Court on June
9, 1970, few people would have predicted that this soft-spoken,
61-year-old judge, a lifelong Republican never known for breaking
new ground or challenging the status quo, was about to embark on an
extraordinary personal journey that by the time he retired 24 years
later would find him as one of the last remaining liberal voices on
a transformed court.
</P>
<P>
   Not even three years into his tenure, Blackmun guaranteed his
place in the country's judicial, political and social history as
the author of Roe vs. Wade, the decision that established a
constitutional right for women to obtain abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In that opinion, on which Blackmun labored for more than a year,
the court found constitutional protection for ``a right of personal
privacy'' that is ``broad enough to encompass a woman's decision
whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote in Roe vs. Wade was 7-2, an indication that far from
being solely the product of Blackmun's personal vision, the
decision reflected a broad consensus on the court that the time had
come to end the criminal prohibitions against abortion that in 1973
were still retained by most states. Even such a conservative member
of the court as Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Blackmun's boyhood
friend from St. Paul, Minn., joined the opinion that he had
assigned Blackmun to write.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it was Blackmun who became the personal symbol of
the abortion issue that assumed an increasingly dominant, and
divisive, role in U.S. politics. Abortion opponents flooded his
chambers at the court with tens of thousands of letters. ``Think of
any name; I've been called it in these letters,'' he said in a 1983
interview. When he appeared in public, even years after the
decision, Blackmun was sometimes confronted by pickets and
hecklers.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his career on the court, as the majority in
favor of a constitutional right to abortion dwindled, Blackmun
became another kind of symbol as a grim survivor of what looked
like a judicial counter-revolution. In 1989, the court voted in
Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services to uphold a Missouri law
that restricted access to abortion. The 5-4 decision did not
overturn Roe vs. Wade, but indicated that the framework of the 1973
decision no longer commanded a majority on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun, then 80, read his dissenting opinion in a tense and
hushed courtroom. ``I fear for the future,'' he said. ``The signs
are evident and very ominous, and a chill wind blows.''
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent retirements of Justices William J. Brennan in
1990 and Thurgood Marshall the next year left Blackmun as the only
remaining member of the Roe vs. Wade majority still serving on the
court. Roe vs. Wade did indeed appear doomed.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 1992 decision that took much of the country by
surprise, a new majority coalesced to preserve and even to solidify
the constitutional right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The plurality opinion in that case, Planned Parenthood vs.
Casey, reaffirmed what it called the ``essential holding'' of Roe
vs. Wade, the right of a woman to choose abortion during the first
six months of pregnancy, before the fetus is able to live outside
the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun did not agree with all of the plurality's opinion. He
would have struck down all the abortion regulations in the
Pennsylvania law that was before the court, while the plurality
opinion upheld most of them.
</P>
<P>
   But he signed the portion of the opinion reaffirming the
constitutional framework for the right to abortion. ``Just when
many expected the darkness to fall, the flame has grown bright,''
he wrote in a separate opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun also used his separate opinion to underscore the
fragility of the court's support for the right to abortion, since a
dissenting opinion signed by four justices had called for Roe vs.
Wade to be overturned. ``I fear for the darkness as four justices
anxiously await the single vote necessary to extinguish the
light,'' he said, adding: ``I am 83 years old. I cannot remain on
this court forever.'' He predicted a fierce confirmation battle for
whoever was named to succeed to his seat.
</P>
<P>
   But that battle did not materialize. By the time Blackmun
announced, on April 6, 1994, that he would retire at the end of
court's 1993-94 term, a Democrat was in the White House. The margin
of support for abortion rights on the court was a solid 6-3, the
result of President Bill Clinton's choice of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to
replace Justice Byron R. White, a long-time opponent of Roe vs.
Wade who retired in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed Blackmun, Clinton chose Stephen G. Breyer, a federal
appeals court judge who was widely assumed to support abortion
rights. Breyer was easily confirmed after a four-day hearing in
which the right to abortion _ no longer perceived as being at stake
_ never became an issue.
</P>
<P>
   During his first few years on the court, Blackmun's votes so
closely paralleled those of the chief justice, Burger, that he
appeared to be in his old friend's shadow. While the two were
popularly identified as the ``Minnesota Twins,'' the derisive label
also carried the clear implication that Blackmun was the junior
twin.
</P>
<P>
   The label lingered after it had long become outdated. By the
court's 1985-86 term, Burger's last year on the bench, the two were
voting together less than half the time in cases in which the court
was not unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   In civil liberties cases, particularly, Blackmun was much more
likely to vote with Justices Brennan and Marshall than with the
court's conservatives. By the end of his career, after those two
justices had retired and Blackmun became the court's senior
associate justice, his was the most reliable voice for civil
liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun's survivors include his wife, the former Dorothy Clark,
and their daughters, Dr. Nancy C. Blackmun, a psychologist, of
Framingham, Mass.; Sally Ann Blackmun, a lawyer, of Orlando, Fla.,
and Susan Blackmun, a freelance writer, also of Orlando, and five
grandchildren.

</P>
<P>
   Harry Andrew Blackmun was born Nov. 12, 1908, in Nashville,
Ill., the son of Corwin Manning Blackmun and the former Theo
Reuter. The family moved to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area when he
was a small child.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, the Harvard Club of Minnesota offered
Blackmun a scholarship to Harvard, where he compiled an impressive
academic record. Faced with a close choice between law school and
medical school, he chose Harvard Law School but retained a lifelong
interest in and respect for the medical profession.
</P>
<P>
   He did well in law school, graduating in 1932 and accepting a
federal appeals court clerkship back in Minnesota with an 8th
Circuit judge, John B. Sanborn.
</P>
<P>
   After his clerkship, he taught for a year at a local law school,
the St. Paul College of Law, now known as the William Mitchell
College of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun then joined a prestigious Minneapolis law firm, Dorsey,
Colman, Barker, Scott &AMP; Barber. He spent 16 years there, working on
tax and estate cases and on the firm's longtime representation of
the Mayo Clinic, the well-known medical research and treatment
center in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, he left private practice to become general counsel of
the clinic. He spent nearly 10 years in that position, a period he
later said was the happiest in his professional life. The job let
him apply his legal skills to his lifelong interest in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun's appointment to the Supreme Court was the result of
political happenstance. He was Nixon's third choice to fill the
vacancy created by the forced resignation of Justice Abe Fortas.
The Senate rejected Nixon's first two choices, Clement F.
Haynsworth Jr., a federal appeals court judge from South Carolina,
and G. Harrold Carswell, a federal district judge from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's action frustrated the Nixon administration's plan
to name a Southerner to the court. Nixon then looked north in
search of a noncontroversial nominee who could be easily confirmed
and who at the same time would fit the requirement the president
had set for a ``law and order'' judge.
</P>
<P>
   Burger, whom Nixon had named to the Supreme Court the year
before, suggested his friend Harry Blackmun. Within a month,
Blackmun was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 94-0. The Supreme
Court seat once occupied by such justices as Oliver Wendell Holmes,
Benjamin N. Cardozo and Felix Frankfurter had been vacant for a
year by the time Blackmun took the oath of office.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the events that led to his nomination, Blackmun later
referred to himself wryly as ``Old Number Three.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the court, few tourists would have picked Harry Blackmun
out as a justice. He never acquired a trace of self-importance. He
was modest in both his manner and appearance, rarely wearing a suit
to work. He was a good storyteller and excellent mimic, using that
skill to devastating effect in deadpan impersonations of his
colleagues on the court. Trim and sprightly even in advanced age,
he exercised daily in the Supreme Court gym.
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt, nothing else Blackmun ever wrote had as great an
effect or was scrutinized as carefully as his 50-page opinion in
Roe vs. Wade, issued on Jan. 22, 1973.
</P>
<P>
   For the remainder of his career, Blackmun regarded Roe vs. Wade
with pride and a fierce attachment. ``If it goes down the drain,''
he told a group of law students in 1986, ``I'd still like to regard
Roe vs. Wade as a landmark in the progress of the emancipation of
women.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he retired at the age of 85, Blackmun was the
third-oldest person ever to serve on the court. Only Justice Oliver
Wendell Holmes, who retired at age 90, and Chief Justice Roger B.
Taney, who died in office at 87, were older.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the numbers are, and it's time,'' Blackmun said as
he stood with Clinton at a White House press conference on April 6,
1994. The president praised him warmly. ``Justice has not only been
his title, it has been his guiding light,'' Clinton said.

GORDON C. MCKIBBEN, GLOBE EDITOR WHO RETOOLED BUSINESS COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Gordon C. McKibben, the architect of The Boston Globe's
modern business coverage, died Wednesday at his home in Lexington
after a bout with cancer. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Hired as business editor of the newspaper in 1980, Mr. McKibben
remade the Globe's financial section. He expanded the staff,
boosted coverage, and pushed the paper to write about subjects like
computers and biotechnology that previously had been mostly
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the business section, he went to London as
European correspondent, then returned to Boston to take up the
ombudsman's post at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the finest editors I ever knew and a superb
human being,'' said William O. Taylor, retired publisher of the
Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McKibben had a long and distinguished career in journalism
before he came to the Globe. He spent several years with the Wall
Street Journal in Los Angeles before moving to Business Week, his
employer for 17 years. At Business Week he covered everything from
the young Muhammad Ali to Canadian politics to the growing
technology industry along Route 128 in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   At the Globe, Mr. McKibben made his mark both professionally and
personally. Said John S. Driscoll, a former editor of the paper,
``Gordon had a special quality that was unmatched: the
professionalism of a veteran and the inquisitiveness and enthusiasm
of a cub reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   As a writer at the Globe, Mr. McKibben reported on the collapse
of the Soviet bloc. He also produced a series of stories on the
Arctic _ the kind of adventure he thrived on.
</P>
<P>
   And as the ombudsman _ the readers' representative inside the
Globe _ Mr. McKibben came into daily contact with a wide range of
readers. He used his biweekly column to explain to them the inner
workings of the newspaper's operations and, when he felt it
necessary, to offer hiw own opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McKibben didn't slow down in retirement. With Gillette's
cooperation, he produced a history of the company called ``The
Cutting Edge,'' which was published last year by Harvard Business
School Press. The book will be translated into Chinese and Thai
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McKibben was an active member of the Hancock United Church
of Christ in Lexington, a longtime member of the Lexington
Bicentennial Band flute section, and a volunteer in a Lexington
group that provided free rides for people who had to go to doctors'
appointments. An outdoorsman, he took his sons and brother in 1995
on a 100-mile hike around Mt. Rainier in Washington, retracing a
trip he had made when he was 15.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McKibben earned his bachelor's degree at Stanford University
and a master's degree in political science from the University of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Peggy; two sons, William E. of Johnsburg,
N.Y., and Thomas G. of Freeport, Maine; two brothers, William T. of
Grinnell, Iowa, and Ernest C. Jr. of Redmond, Wash., a sister,
Helena Kirkwood of Whidby Island, Wash.; and two grandchildren.

HILLARY CLINTON URGES WOMEN TO SEEK CONTROL   OVER THEIR LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, speaking Thursday at a
UN conference on women, discussed the suffering from sexual slavery
and domestic abuse, and urged women to take greater charge of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton did not address the issue on the minds of many in
attendance: whether she will announce a run for the Senate seat in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the answer, it was clear that the hundreds of people in
the packed, mostly female, audience at UN headquarters had come to
offer their support. They greeted Clinton, who arrived about 30
minutes late, with cheers and a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they are talking about her running for
Senate,'' quipped ABC correspondent Carole Simpson, who joined the
first lady at the commemoration of International Women's Day.
``Mrs. Clinton ought to be running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   In her speech, Clinton denounced Thai families for selling their
daughters to prostitution rings. And she railed against
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban for forbidding women to study,
practice medicine, or teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is probably no more egregious and systematic trampling
of fundamental rights of women today than what is happening in
Afghanistan,'' she said. ``There are stories of women being flogged
with metal cables because a bit of their ankle is showing.''
</P>
<P>
   She also spoke of success stories.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, she said, a new law was passed banning spousal abuse.
Senegal recently outlawed the practice of female genital
mutilation. And she recounted a story of an Indian woman who fought
a legal system that deprived her of her husband's property upon his
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has her house and ... she has her dignity. And I'm told
she's even running for elective office in her community,'' she
added to laughter and applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the United Nations to the United States to places
throughout the world, more women are holding positions of power and
authority,'' Clinton said. ``We must strive ... to create the
conditions in which women have the right to make the choices in
their lives for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton applauded UN Secretary General Kofi Annan for announcing
a new UN policy to seize the salaries of ``deadbeat'' dads at the
UN who fail to pay child support or alimony. For years, the UN has
been criticized for shielding UN employees from foreign countries
who have abandoned their wives and children.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady did not discuss Barbara Walters' Wednesday
interview with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Following her speech, Clinton visited a Manhattan school and
attended a screening of an HBO documentary on women athletes. The
documentary, ``Dare to Compete: The Struggle of Women in Sports,''
begins with an interview with the first lady in which she says,
``Victory belongs to only those who dare to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   In her first visit to New York since she announced she was
giving ``careful thought'' to a Senate battle, Clinton teased a
group of supporters at a gathering at the Plaza Hotel Wednesday.
``I was told that there were some who thought I might have an
announcement to make,'' she said, pausing before adding, ``I
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her interest in New York politics, Clinton said Thursday
she is planning to travel to Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco to listen
to the ``voices'' of North African women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many women around the world are finding their voice in new
ways,'' she said. ``We have to do all we can to make sure those
voices are amplified.''

GIRL TALK ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and l coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA MATCHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Obviously, girl talk is not what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it was reasonable to conclude on Wednesday night when
Barbara Walters plied Monica Lewinsky with questions about her
compulsive tendency to talk about what she did with Bill Clinton.
``You told 10 other people you had this relationship with the
president,'' Walters exclaimed. ``I mean, Bigmouth! Why did you
want people to know?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I trusted my girlfriends implicitly,'' cooed Monica Lewinsky.
``And that's the kind of relationship I have with my close
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what? Is this kind of tell-all relationship with friends
another one of the former White House intern's infinite quirks? Or
is her intimate confessional style what young women are trading in
these days?
</P>
<P>
   The answer seems to be that girltalk these days is racier,
spares less, and spills more. Even at that, say those who study and
write about young women's relationships, the Monica Lewinsky brand
of chitchat _ in all its florid detailing, its frankness about
sexual pleasure, and its sheer repetition factor _ is gossip at its
most extreme. ``It's Monica out of control,'' says social critic
Camille Paglia, who often writes about women's sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there are no statistics ``to see if women are
confiding more than they used to be,'' observes Florence Isaacs,
author of the new book ``Toxic Friends/True Friends: How Your
Friends Can Make or Break your Health, Happiness, Family and
Career.''
</P>
<P>
   But everyone interviewed agreed that unlike men, most women have
a visceral need to share intimate and provocative details of their
lives with their closest friends. ``Girls like to bond in ways that
reveal their innermost secrets,'' says Paglia. ``It's an
addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for women it's like a tree falling in the forest. If
no one hears it, it didn't really fall,'' says Meghan Daum, 29, who
writes a monthly column on cultural issues for Self magazine. ``You
know when Monica said she had to replay the phone answering machine
message for her friends? Everyone does that. It's a huge part of
being female, it's a ritual. The relationship has to be
validated.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Lewinsky's bold sexuality doesn't seem beyond the norm to
those 30 and under. ``It's not unusual in that generation,'' says
30-year-old writer and social commentator Katie Roiphe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think women of her age are more in control of their
sexuality. This partly has to do with growing up in the last
glimmer of the sexual revolution. And I think that women in their
20s are more comfortable with the idea of sleeping with lots of
people than our mothers were,'' says Roiphe. ``People do talk about
sexual details. I don't think of that kind of sexual confession as
particularly unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course Lewinsky wasn't sharing just any old details. She was
getting down to the level of sperm and specific accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Yazel, 28, editor of the ``Friends'' page in Glamour
magazine, says, ``I was struck by the level of detail she would
tell friends about the cigar.''
</P>
<P>
   And everyone, it seems, was struck by how wide a net of ``best
friends'' Lewinsky cast. ``It doesn't seem surprising to me that
she would have confided to one or two close friends,'' says Roiphe.
``But the fact that she has these 10 best, best, best friends seems
to me most typical of the particular theatrical and needy emotional
type that Monica Lewinsky is. That says something about her, and
not a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the maturing process happens when you realize you
don't have to tell everyone,'' says Jane Larkworthy, 36, beauty
editor of Jane, a lifestyle magazine for 18- to 34-year-olds.
Because what you are really saying is, `See, I'm loved, I'm
attractive.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, laughs Larkworthy, ``I know lots of
respectable women who, if they had the chance to be intimate with
the president, would do it in a heartbeat. If nothing else, they'd
do it for the bragging rights.''

 &HT;    LEWINSKY WORKS CHARMS ON BRITISH TV
 &HT;    Moving in both the International and Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON Monica Lewinksy evolved from being a favorite source of
saucy pub jokes Thursday to being regarded as flesh and blood by
Britons long fascinated by the odd mess that has consumed their
American cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always thought the Monica jokes were the best,'' said
Len Armstrong, who watched Lewinsky's hour-long television
interview with friends and relatives in his home in Great Bookham.
``But, now that we've heard her, we've warmed a bit to her.''
</P>
<P>
   For an hour, the camera held a close shot of Lewinsky, smiling
and nodding energetically through the questions put gently to her
by dignified, gray-haired TV interviewer Jon Snow.
</P>
<P>
   Snow caused no tears, but he managed to prompt a few weighty
observations from the 25-year-old former White House intern.
``Married men are definite no-nos, never again,'' she said, summing
up the lessons of her tangled journey to celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   At the Armstrong house, the crowd was impressed. ``We thought
she was quite dignified,'' Armstrong said. ``We thought she might
go for the president, but she never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``What came across is her humanity, which had been ignored by
the press particularly the British press, which had demonized
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Channel 4 paid Lewinsky $660,000 for the interview, which was
taped last week in New York. The station ensured its investment
will pay off by selling the rebroadcast rights in more than 30
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The interview followed a documentary called ``The Half Monty,''
which traced the bittersweet careers of five diminutive male
strippers.
</P>
<P>
   In what one newspaper has called ``Monica Week,'' Lewinsky
arrived in London Thursday for a tour to promote her book, which
will be on the shelves here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, she is scheduled to appear at Harrods, the toney
London department store, to sign copies. Her itinerary includes 19
stops across Britain before heading home March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Even though most Britons have heard her story umpteen times,
Lewinsky will nevertheless generate a buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will still be interested because of the sexual nature
of it,'' said Martin O'Hara, a surveyor who lives in the Surrey
village of West Horsley. ``But I shan't be attending.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Monica Lewinsky: The Interview'' generated some interest
in the media Thursday, it didn't seem to cause Britons to cancel
plans in order to sit riveted to the television. ``Now, when
Princess Diana gave an interview,'' O'Hara observed, ``everybody
went home to watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky long has been a familiar character in the British
tabloids, which have dubbed the scandal that nearly unseated the
president ``Zippergate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mirror reportedly paid Lewinsky several hundred thousand
dollars for its ``world scoop'' interview, which has appeared this
week in installments.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the Mirror's coverage has been fluff, Lewinsky
displayed a mischievous sense of humor when she joked at one point
about her infamous encounter with the ''first cigar,'' which she
described as a ``silly'' thing that happened only once.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, I don't think I'll be going to a cigar bar again,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also will grace the cover of the U.K. edition of the women's
magazine, Marie Claire. She was photographed by Patrick
Demarchelier, who created the famous Diana front cover for Vogue in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the many odd intersections between the former
intern and late princess.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Morton, who authored ``Monica's Story,'' was Princess
Diana's unofficial biographer and lead propagandist in her war with
Prince Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Harrods, where Lewinsky will first meet the British public, is
owned by the father of Dodi al-Fayed, Diana's companion who died
with her in Paris in a 1997 car crash.
</P>
<P>
   In a Sunday Mirror interview, Lewinsky compared herself to
Diana, saying she was in the ``similar situation'' of being
``wronged'' by the man she loved.
</P>
<P>
   She claimed her affair with Clinton was similar to Diana's
marriage to Prince Charles. ``I'm not a princess in a royal sense
but I was also wronged by a man who said he loved me,'' she told
the Mirror. ``And remember, I was in love with him. I was trapped,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he saw a common theme between the two. ``They
were both very naive,'' he said. ``They never understood the effect
of power. Diana didn't recognized how much power she had, and
Monica didn't recognize the power of the president. She also didn't
recognize how shallow her relationship was with Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   In the TV interview, Snow asked if she had a love/hate
relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not love him, but sometimes I hate him,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a black suit with her hair discreetly coiffed away from
her face, she recounted the now familiar story of their blossoming
affair.
</P>
<P>
   She giggled girlishly and covered her face when Snow asked if
Clinton made her tingle early in their relationship, which she said
was motivated at first for her by ``lust.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it more than sex?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes,'' she said excitedly. ``The sexual aspects of the
relationship were just one component of it, it was my love.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he love you?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in his own way he did, I think in his own way he
thought that I was special, I don't know about now,'' she said. ``I
don't know if that's the truth but I think so.''
</P>
<P>
   What did she think of Clinton in the beginning?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was a brilliant man who had a very big heart who
was kind, not necessarily nice, but kind,'' she said. ``A person
who had a large appetite for love I don't mean in the crude sense
love.''
</P>
<P>
   What would she do with the dress if she could get her hands on
it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd burn it,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two British balloonists seeking to become the first to circle
the world nonstop have surpassed some of their biggest hazards,
greatly improving their chances of ultimate success.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots of the huge balloon, Andy Elson, a 45-year-old
aeronautical engineer, and Colin Prescot, 48, Thursday completed
difficult maneuvers to skirt Chinese air space, which was barred to
them. With that, they put their worst political problem behind them
and headed for weather that is expected to be swift and smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Their balloon, the Cable &AMP; Wireless, was reported Thursday to be
over the South China Sea, nearing Taiwan and the voyage's halfway
point.
</P>
<P>
   The team, which set off from Spain on Feb. 17, set a new
ballooning endurance record on Saturday, when they passed 9 days
and 18 hours aloft, a mark set in February 1998 by the
Swiss-registered Breitling Orbiter 2 (one of whose pilots was
Elson).
</P>
<P>
   But Cable &AMP; Wireless has not yet broken the distance record:
14,232 miles flown last August by an American commodities broker,
Steve Fossett.
</P>
<P>
   Many balloonists have attempted circumnavigation, but none has
ever come close.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles are formidable:
</P>
<P>
   _ The balloon must remain aloft, with food and water for its
pilots and fuel for its hot-air burners, for at least two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Meteorologists and the air crew must work in close
cooperation, constantly changing altitude to take advantage of
winds heading in the desired directions. _ Balloonists must avoid
countries where they lack overflight permission and could be forced
down. China, which lies athwart some of the most desirable jet
streams, has refused to allow balloons piloted by Britons or
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the Cable &AMP; Wireless fought through violent
thunderstorms over Thailand, and after passing over Indochina, the
two pilots had to fly a restricted course to avoid Chinese air
space. They reported passing within 30 miles of Hainan island,
which is Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Elson and Prescot expect to enter a jet stream in the next day
that could drive them speedily across the Pacific Ocean to
Vancouver, British Columbia, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   A second balloon, the Breitling Orbiter 3, took to the air from
Switzerland on Monday to race the Cable &AMP; Wireless. The Orbiter 3,
like the Cable &AMP; Wireless, was built by the British company Cameron
Balloons Ltd., and is lifted by both helium gas and hot air. The
pilots are Dr. Bertrand Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and Brian
Jones, a British balloonist.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the desired jet stream, Piccard reported having to fly
southwest over the Sahara before turning eastward. His ground crew
expect the Orbiter 3 to reach Egypt Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After a half dozen failed attempts during the past year, it
became clear that balloons need greater endurance if they are to
thread their way around political and geographical barriers, which
uses up fuel and supplies. To accomplish this, balloons have to
carry more fuel for heating the air that supplies part of the lift;
but this means building larger balloons to carry more fuel
containers.
</P>
<P>
   This led to design changes. The Cable &AMP; Wireless contains more
than a million cubic feet of helium and hot air, making it the
largest balloon of this type ever built. Its hot-air burners are
fueled with kerosene rather than the more usual propane; kerosene
containers weigh less than pressurized propane cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   These changes, the Cable &AMP; Wireless team reported, have made it
possible to use a ``low and slow'' strategy that has so far evaded
the major obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Orbiter 3 began its flight nearly two weeks after
the Cable &AMP; Wireless, its crew expects to catch up. Because of its
Swiss registry, the Orbiter 3 has been granted permission by China
to fly over the south of the country to take advantage of a
high-speed jet stream.

 &HT;    Virginia obtains AOL center Georgia failed to secure
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three weeks after dismissing Cobb County, Ga., as a
candidate for a new $550 million computer center, America Online
has chosen a site in northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after the Virginia General Assembly quietly
approved tax exemptions worth $18 million or more on the new
facility, The Washington Post reported Thursday. Incentives also
would cut Dulles, Va.-based AOL's existing expenses by $4 million a
year, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The new center will be located in Prince William County, near
Manassas. Virginia Gov. James S. Gilmore III has scheduled a news
conference Wednesday to announce the AOL deal, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's loss of the facility _ and how Virginia won it _ may
fuel the debate over sweetening Georgia's recruitment incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes' press secretary, Gary Horlacher, declined to
comment on AOL's decision. But he said the governor ``conceptually
agrees with those who are seeing the anecdotal evidence that
Georgia needs to do something. He's also said he's not going to do
anything that will not be fiscally prudent for the state.''
</P>
<P>
   There were indications the General Assembly would consider
boosting incentives this year, but Barnes' desire for harder study
appears to have delayed action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's approach is to take a really comprehensive look
at all things that can be called incentives, and I think that's the
right approach,'' said Randy Cardoza, commissioner of industry,
trade and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Site selection experts say incentives aren't usually the top
draw for relocating or expanding companies but can become a
``tiebreaker.'' Indeed, the Post reported that North Carolina
offered AOL $28 million in tax credits over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   A complete price was never placed on Georgia's bid, although
Cobb County Commission Chairman Bill Byrne said earlier the state
was willing to buy a $5 million site as part of an incentives
package. In December, Byrne said AOL had chosen a Cobb site for the
data center. But last month AOL said it had ruled out Georgia as a
site for the center.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Washington Post report, Virginia officials
pushed a bill through the just-ended legislative session to waive
the 4.5 percent sales tax on computer servers and other equipment
purchased by Internet providers that offer their own content. The
bill's sponsors sold the incentives as part of a general update of
the tax code, the Post said, and only a small group of state
officials knew the legislation was being written to benefit AOL.

 &HT;    K&AMP;G Men's Center selling chain to rival
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta-based K&AMP;G Men's Center Inc. has agreed to sell
its chain of 33 stores to Men's Wearhouse Inc. for as much as $133
million in stock, or $13 a share, in a pooling-of-interest
transaction announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fremont, Calif.-based Men's Wearhouse, the largest U.S. retailer
of men's suits, plans to combine 20 of its lowest-price stores with
K&AMP;G's operations and run it as an Atlanta-based division. Men's
Wearhouse runs K&AMP;G look-alike stores known as SuitMax in Atlanta
and six other cities. A store in Detroit operates as Suit
Warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The company will likely close overlapping off-price stores in
markets such as Atlanta, which has four K&AMP;G stores and one SuitMax,
said John Dancu, K&AMP;G's chief operating officer. K&AMP;G will retain its
name, he said.
</P>
<P>
   K&AMP;G's successful corporate run began to unravel last summer. A
series of disappointments kept the company from regaining
investors' confidence, analysts said. Stephen Greenspan, chairman
and president of K&AMP;G, launched the no-frills company 10 years ago
in the Chattahoochee warehouse district. Then a liquidator,
Greenspan founded the company by selling a truckload of men's suits
leftover from a department store bankruptcy. He raked in $120,000
the first weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend formula remained a hit for some time. K&AMP;G built a
profitable enterprise by staying open three days a week and running
warehouse-style stores in industrial neighborhoods. The company
went public with eight stores in 1996 and charmed Wall Street with
its bare-bones style, aggressive growth plans and strong sales.
</P>
<P>
   After a secondary offering last summer, the love fest started to
cool. In July, the stock neared its all-time high at $26.62 1/2,
which analysts called a rich price for a small company. Plus, the
men's suit market began to soften in the second half of the year as
the continued growth of ``business casual'' wear counteracted the
expansion of tailored suit superstores. Investors and insiders
began selling, and the stock took a dive. Since September, the
price has stayed near $10.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers had been expecting K&AMP;G to sell to Men's
Wearhouse, but not so soon, said Robinson-Humphrey analyst Dan
Wewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bittersweet situation. They negotiated from a weak
position rather than a strong one,'' Wewer said. ``I thought they'd
wait and get the stock back up.'' K&AMP;G closed Thursday at $9.37 1/2,
up $1.
</P>
<P>
   Several setbacks in 1998 probably laid the groundwork for the
merger, Wewer said. Unusually warm weather during the fall and
winter hurt K&AMP;G sales, and the company made some bad real estate
decisions in Houston, Los Angeles and New York. ``They probably saw
some tough times ahead, especially with aggressive growth by Men's
Wearhouse,'' Wewer said.
</P>
<P>
   The merger keeps K&AMP;G's growth plans alive. ``We've always had a
goal of 100-plus stores, and we still want to be a national
retailer. That won't change,'' Dancu said. K&AMP;G currently is in 16
states.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan will become chief executive of the Men's Wearhouse
division and will join the company's board of directors. The rest
of K&AMP;G's management team will remain intact for the time being,
Dancu said.
</P>
<P>
   Pending approval of K&AMP;G shareholders, the companies expect the
transaction to close in the second quarter of fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is the second in five months for Men's
Wearhouse. In November, it agreed to buy Canada's Moores Retail
Group Inc. for as much as $127 million in stock and debt. The
company operates more than 400 stores in the United States. It had
sales of $767.9 million in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months of fiscal 1998, K&AMP;G had sales of $91.6
million.

 &HT;    Ad executives love Turner tales about old times and new
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Does this city love Ted Turner or what? This town's
infamously hard-knuckled ad executives gave Turner a standing
ovation Thursday as he regaled them in funny tales of his early
years.
</P>
<P>
   What a change from 25 years ago, when Turner first came to New
York trying to sell Madison Avenue on the merits of his fledgling
cable TV channels. Back then nobody would advertise with him.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday the city was eating out of his hand as he addressed
a luncheon crowd of some 1,500 executives. Turner, now vice
chairman of Time Warner, was the luncheon speaker at the annual
conference of the Cable Advertising Bureau. CAB represents media
buyers, the people who buy ad time on television and in newspapers
and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to be hard to convince the New York
advertising community, but I had no idea how hard,'' Turner
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first team of salesmen ended up like the soldiers in the
opening scene of 'Saving Private Ryan.' They were mowed down to a
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who founded the Atlanta-based television network of the
same name, didn't launch the first cable TV channel. He was,
though, the first to try to get advertising on his channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were what I'd called a transactional network,'' Turner
teased. Only companies that sold merchandise through direct mail
would advertise initially on TBS, Turner's first channel.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers mailed their checks to TBS, and Turner used that mail to
measure his channel's initial viewership. He divided the piles by
location. Half of it, he found, was from people outside Atlanta,
and he used that fact to argue TBS had a national viewership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't exactly a compelling argument to Procter &AMP; Gamble,
but I thought it was pretty cool,'' said Turner.
</P>
<P>
   The insider's wisecrack left his audience in stitches.
</P>
<P>
   In separating his mail, Turner said he noticed something else.
Every 20th letter had a stamp without a postmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I said, here's a chance to make some revenue,'' said
Turner. ``I took the letters to our mail room and made them cut off
and re-use the stamps. I figured I made a dime on every stamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the early days were tough, Turner said he misses them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be back in sales, but they've kicked me upstairs
to a nice corner office,'' he said. ``I try and keep up with it. My
secretary gets me the sales reports, which makes me feel like Paley
in his final years at CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   Paley, of course, is William Paley, the legendary broadcaster
who founded CBS. Turner tried unsuccessfully to buy the network
early in his career.

 &HT;    Bonuses fizzle for Coca-Cola chairman
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Reflecting Coca-Cola Co.'s turbulent financial
performance, the total cash compensation for Chairman and Chief
Executive M. Douglas Ivester fell $470,000 last year to $3.59
million, the company's proxy statement shows.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, however, was given 250,000 shares of restricted stock
valued at $16.9 million. That's almost double the value of
restricted stock he received a year earlier, when he was president
and chief operating officer. The total value of Ivester's
restricted stock is $131 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the 1998 increase in restricted stock reflected
its long-term confidence in Ivester's leadership ability. He,
however, will forfeit that stock if he doesn't stay with the
company for at least another decade and retire from it. Those
conditions exist to retain ``those individuals who are key to the
creation of share-owner value,'' the proxy said.
</P>
<P>
   That value has come under immense pressure lately, with the
stock price falling 29 percent from its 52-week high last July.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, 51, saw his base salary remain the same at $1.25
million. His last salary increase was in November 1997, after he
took over from the late Roberto C. Goizueta.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester's annual cash bonus, which is based on company
performance, fell to $1.5 million last year, down from $2 million
in 1997. The company's profits last year fell 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And cash payments to Ivester from a long-term incentive plan,
which also is based on the company's performance, dropped to
$702,000, compared with $1.1 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ivester exercised stock options that were awarded 10
years ago, giving him a paper gain of $37 million. He also has the
rights to additional stock options worth $106 million, which he has
not exercised yet.
</P>
<P>
   In an annual report, which also was released Thursday, Ivester
came out swinging against company critics in his letter to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, as our stock slid from its July high, pundits were
quick to pronounce us and other multinational companies passe,'' he
wrote. ``Exposed to the world's economic woes, we were deemed to be
_ get this _ too global.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Ivester said, he takes the global label as a compliment.
And despite that the continued financial woes overseas will make
1999 another challenging year, Ivester said the company's long-term
strategies will successfully propel it into the future.

UKRAINE'S EX-PREMIER SAYS HE'S CLOSER TO GAINING ASYLUM IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Pavlo Lazarenko, the former Ukrainian prime minister
who asserts that the nation's leaders are using corruption charges
to persecute him, said Thursday that he had cleared the first
procedural hurdle toward winning political asylum in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Without confirming or denying that, a federal official in the
United States remarked later that more than four in five applicants
for asylum clear the same bar. Only a fraction of those who succeed
win permanent residence in the United States, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement made public by his lawyers, Lazarenko said the
federal Immigration and Naturalization Service has concluded that
he displays a credible fear of persecution should the United States
return him to Ukraine against his will.
</P>
<P>
   ``While my supporters in Ukraine continue to advance my platform
for a vibrant economy, I will continue to seek temporary political
asylum in the United States,'` Lazarenko's statement read. ``I am
confident that officials here will understand my situation and act
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement, Ukraine's prosecutor general, Mykhaylo
Potebenko, told the Interfax-Ukraine news service that he was
confident of Lazarenko's eventual return to Ukraine for
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ukraine had given the United States evidence of
Lazarenko's crimes, and that no nation would wish to grant him safe
haven given the evidence against him.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarenko, who was second-in-command to Ukraine's president,
Leonid Kuchma, in 1996 and 1997, has been in federal custody in
Queens since Feb. 19, when he arrived at Kennedy International
Airport and was judged to have an invalid visa.
</P>
<P>
   He fled Ukraine only days before prosecutors there charged him
with embezzling and misusing millions of dollars in government
funds as part of a long-running corruption scheme. In December, the
Swiss government arrested Lazarenko at the border and charged him
with laundering millions of dollars through numbered bank accounts
there.
</P>
<P>
   In Ukraine, which has been plagued by endemic official
corruption since its independence in 1991, Lazarenko is widely
reported to be one of the nation's richest men. Repeated reports
have placed him at the center of multimillion-dollar kickback and
rake-off schemes as prime minister and, before that, as governor of
an eastern Ukraine region.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that he is ``no angel,'' Lazarenko has insisted
that he has acted legally. Then and now, he has asserted that the
corruption charges are a plot by Kuchma to destroy him politically.
</P>
<P>
   The two men have been bitter enemies since Kuchma dismissed
Lazarenko almost two years ago, and Lazarenko is now a minor-party
opponent of Kuchma's in Ukraine's presidential election in October.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Thursday, Lazarenko said the Ukrainian charges
were ``totally without substance'' and that the Swiss and Ukrainian
accusations ``are part of a systematic, politically motivated plot
to repress opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be intimidated by such tactics,'' he said, adding
that he is continuing his presidential campaign even as he seeks to
remain in the United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lazarenko's lawyers said Thursday that the ruling in his favor
came after a four-hour interview by immigration officials and an
eight-page, point-by-point review of his assertions of persecution
at the hands of the Kuchma administration.
</P>
<P>
   James Mayock, a partner in the San Francisco law firm that
represents Lazarenko, said his cause was not hurt by the fact that
his client was mentioned in the State Department's own global
reviews of human-rights problems.
</P>
<P>
   The department's 1997 report, which was somewhat critical of
Ukraine's human-rights record, hinted at political motives for what
it called an ``alleged assassination attempt on the then-prime
minister, Pavlo Lazarenko, whose car reportedly barely escaped a
bomb explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard not to find he has credible fear when you're
mentioned in that report,' Mayock said.

   FILM-WINDHORSE _ After the financial flop of both ``Kundun'' and
``Seven Years in Tibet'' in late 1997, one Hollywood trade paper
predicted it ``would be a long time before an American filmmaker
made a contemporary movie about Tibet again.'' Yet, barely a year
later, here is ``Windhorse,'' another (albeit smaller budget) U.S.
film that sets its story against the brutal Chinese subjugation of
Tibet. It's an effective piece of muckraking too, and perhaps
somewhat more.

   FILM-INNOCENCE _ Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf has argued
``the European cinema offers sex and violence, the Indian cinema
sells dreams and the Iranian cinema tries to sell poetry.''
Makhmalbaf ingeniously meshes pure cinematic visual imagery with
delicate, poetic stories. His 1996 film ``A Moment of Innocence''
is certainly no exception.

   FILM-STEAM _ Despite its drama, the real star of ``Steam: The

the enchantment of the city of Istanbul, which, with its Moorish
architecture, primary colors and food-filled social traditions,
feels inviting and warm.

TEXAS SCHOOLS REALLY DID `PILLAGE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Star-Telegram has uncovered indisputable
evidence of a Texas-based plot to pilfer another of this city's
prize possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Your Intrepid Reporter believes that the Big 12 Conference
basketball tournament, contractually obligated to this site through
2000, will be moved when new deals are arranged. I discovered this
breaking news story by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Kemper Arena (think Reunion Arena, but uglier and
farther away from downtown) you have your basic backstage series of
rooms and hallways. Searching for a soda machine (I loathe Dr
Pepper, the Big 12's Official Drink), I noticed a room marked
``Storage'' where the door was ajar.
</P>
<P>
   Curious, I looked inside. Behind a stack of Kings and Scouts
souvenirs (NBA and NHL franchises that also left town), I saw two
men sitting at a table. Each were talking on cell phones while
typing on laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmmm. Fellow journalists looking for privacy? I said hello.
Both turned, their faces ashen at being discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whar yew frum, son?'' the stocky one asked me. My answer
seemed to relax both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't tell nobody nuthin' 'bout this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They introduced themselves. The stocky one said he was Robin
Pillage. ``Pillage?'' I asked. ``It's pronounced Pil-laj,'' he
hissed, emphasizing the second syllable. The taller one said he was
I.M. Swindle. When I asked if he was related to the pitcher, he
just glared.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Pillage, the talkative one, told me of their mission.
</P>
<P>
   As the locals believe, there's a conspiracy afoot. The diehard
former Big Eight Conference schools _ which are conveniently
forgetting the two Oklahoma schools _ blame the South (i.e. Texas)
for all the talk of taking the Big 12 tournament and leaving K.C.
with nothing more than blues and barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of moving the tournament away from Kansas City to
cities like St. Louis, Oklahoma City, Dallas and San Antonio has
the folks around here whining like an 18-wheeler zipping down the
interstate.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri coach Norm Stewart is saying that the Texas schools
haven't been pulling their weight. And Nebraska coach Danny Nee
says it would be a mistake to leave Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harrumph,'' Pillage said, spitting into a Styrofoam cup.
``He's just a coach. They don't listen to coaches. Stewart, he'll
be gone in a few years, may never have to play a tournament in
Texas. And Nee? He's the basketball coach at Nebraska. That should
clue you in on his clout, hoss.''
</P>
<P>
   As everyone knows, he continued, what the Big 12 office has been
doing is getting organized. New commissioner Kevin Weiberg has
simplified and standardized the method by which cities will bid for
the tournament. If the tournament leaves Kansas City, it will be
for the best offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the guy in Watergate said, follow the money,''
Pillage said. ``You open up a big enough can of cash, you can do
about anything. Those bean counters in Ames and Manhattan and
Columbia realize that if the checks keep coming with lots of
zeroes, they'll figure out ways to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pillage and Swindle said they had to get back to work. Swindle
mumbled something about needing to short-circuit the scoreboard,
embarrass the locals' production values.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we tell you any more, we'll have to kill you,'' Pillage
said.
</P>
<P>
   I'm fairly certain that would be classified as ``accidental
death'' in our company insurance coverage, but I decided not to
chance it. Now that this story is public, I'll be looking over my
shoulder. Just like the good folks of Kansas City.

<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ It took death and dismemberment to
bring together the families of Andrew Peden, a 35-year-old
Protestant, and Andrew Kearney, a 33-year-old Catholic, but the
awkward union is serving to expose one of Northern Ireland's most
persistent and ruthless traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were victims of punishment beatings, where members of
the paramilitary armies that control working-class neighborhoods
turn their violence not on their declared enemies from the other
side of the religious divide but on their own, in a vicious effort
to avoid being swept away in the march toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   Gangs in ski masks haul their victims into darkened alleys and
back streets from homes, street corners, pubs and vehicles. They
bind them, hang them upside down from railings or pin them to the
ground in a crucifixion posture, then beat them with hammers, iron
bars and baseball bats studded with nails. Then they shoot them in
the kneecaps, the thighs or the feet.
</P>
<P>
   Kearney died from an attack by a methodical Irish Republican
Army squad of 10 people who dragged him from the bed where he was
playing with his two-week-old daughter, shot him three times and
then locked him in the elevator of his building and ripped out
telephone lines so no rescuers could reach him before he bled to
death. His crime had been punching an IRA official in a pub
argument.
</P>
<P>
   Peden barely survived shotgun wounds and 10 hours of assault by
members of the Ulster Volunteer Force. He required months of
hospital treatment and a double amputation, leaving him with two
stumps on either side of his groin and a palsied and stunted body
that needs a daily dosage of 42 pills to keep functioning. His was
a case of mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
   In a grim paradox, beatings increase at times like the present,
when cease-fires and political negotiations drastically reduce the
killing between the two warring religious communities and bring the
exhilarating promise of peace.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two months of 1999, with the peace arrangements
taking hold, there were 65 such attacks, 26 more than in the
corresponding, less-settled, period last year, just before the
peace agreement. The attacks ceased last year in the weeks just
before the April 10 signing, but that same night they resumed _ and
their number has been mounting ever since, to the current rate of
one a day, the highest in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The groups weren't challenged when they had the guns behind
them, and this is the way they point out that they still have
them,'' said David Hanna, chief information officer of the Royal
Ulster Constabulary. ``They've had social control for 30 years now,
and they don't want to lose that edge in the new circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Cushnahan, director of Families Against Intimidation and
Terror, a nonsectarian organization that seeks to give voice to
victims of violence, said, ``It's all about power and control.''
</P>
<P>
   The militias took on their enforcement role, particularly in
Catholic neighborhoods, to supplant the reviled British security
forces and the largely Protestant Royal Ulster Constabulary, and to
maintain unity and discipline in their communities as the sectarian
conflict became more intense.
</P>
<P>
   They became such an accepted and feared institution of life in
Northern Ireland that in many cases young men would be delivered to
punishment squads by their relatives and then picked up and taken
home bloodied and battered afterward. The original aim was to curb
drug dealing, vandalism, car theft and other ``antisocial
behavior,'' but today the scores being settled are just as often
grudges, disputes over women and disrespect shown a militia leader.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the sectarian bombings and murders, which still occur,
the savagery is not the work of renegades at odds with the
cease-fire. It is practiced by men and women who answer to
political parties sworn to the nonviolent principles of last year's
accord.
</P>
<P>
   No one questions the fact that parties like Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA, or the Progressive Unionists, the
political representatives of the Ulster Volunteer Force militia,
control the vigilantes and can halt them when it suits their
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the graphs and see a sudden falloff in
punishment beatings,'' Cushnahan said, ``look at the date, and
you'll see it's because someone like Clinton was due to come here
or there was an election scheduled. They can switch it on and
off.''
</P>
<P>
   The walls of Cushnahan's downtown office are covered with
photographs of teen-agers on crutches and artificial legs or lying
in hospital beds with blood stained bandages around their knees.
One pictures John Brown, an 80-year-old pensioner with wounds on
both his ankles and his knees inflicted by an IRA punishment squad
that attacked him in his home. They had mistaken him for another
elderly man suspected of pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   The gangs operate with impunity because no victims testify and
no witnesses come forward for fear of even more vicious
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna remembers getting a rare tip about a teen-ager who had
just been bundled into a car by a Protestant punishment squad.
``When we got there, this kid was a quaking nervous wreck, but
after we rescued him, he said he was fine and that there had been
no problem,'' he said. ``He knew he'd be killed if it was thought
that he had talked to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Peden and Kearney would be just two more soon-forgotten grisly
statistics in Northern Ireland's three decades of bloodshed were it
not for the determination of their families to protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``These groups say they exist to protect our communities,'' said
Peden, propped between two pillows on his living room sofa. ``They
call themselves the sons of Ulster. You call this protection?'' he
asked, pointing down at his severed limbs.

</P>
<P>
   He knows the identities of the men who beat him and sees them in
his neighborhood, the all-Protestant Glencairn housing project. He
wakes up each day to the hated sight of a second-story window in a
building directly across the street: It is the apartment where he
was tortured and shot after being abducted from his own back yard.
</P>
<P>
   For Andrew Kearney's mother, Maureen, 65, speaking out was a
bold departure from a lifelong commitment to the Republican cause,
which favors the end of British rule here and eventual union with
the Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criticizing the IRA is like condemning my own family,'' she
said. Her father was a member; her brother was one of the IRA men
interned by the British in 1971; a nephew served 20 years in prison
for IRA actions. Bobby Sands, who achieved martyr status with his
hunger strike death in 1981, was her cousin; a memorial to Sands
stands a block away from her house in the solidly Catholic
Twinbrook housing project.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kearney nor Peden had any involvement in the tribal
politics of Northern Ireland, and their experiences illustrate the
random and unforgiving nature of the vigilante justice that rules
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Kearney was marked for punishment because he came to the rescue
of a 17-year-old boy being beaten by an IRA brigade commander in a
pub and then challenged the man to a fistfight outside.
</P>
<P>
   Peden became a target because he was thought to be an ally of a
paramilitary neighbor he had simply given a lift home. On arriving
home, the neighbor spotted the car of a leader of a rival group he
suspected was having an affair with his wife. He had the intruder
beaten. The victim ordered revenge. Someone, it turned out, had
noted the license plate of Peden's car.
</P>
<P>
   Peden was seized, blindfolded and thrown onto the floor of a
passing vehicle the next day, Saturday, May 2, as he was preparing
to take his family on a weekend trip to his mother-in-law's house.
He had no idea why he was being assaulted, and when he tried to
protest his innocence during the beating, he said, he was hit and
told to shut up.
</P>
<P>
   At one point his torturers gave him a piece of paper and told
him to write a farewell note to his children. ``Daddy loves you''
was all he remembers writing before being beaten unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kearney, he had received warnings that he was going to
``get done,'' his mother said, and for more than a year he had been
assuring her that he was ``looking over his shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of a local priest, he offered to compose a letter
of apology and recite it in the pub, but IRA representatives told
Mrs. Kearney that it would not satisfy the offended commander's
desire for revenge. The masked men came to get him just after
midnight the morning of July 19, the date that is now on his
tombstone.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kearney has submitted the bill for his funeral to Sinn
Fein, and when she saw one of the men she believed responsible for
her son's killing in a her local supermarket, she pressed a
memorial card picture of Andrew into his hand and loudly accused
him of murder. ``He just laughed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Irish Republican Army, an organization she has been loyal
to her entire life, she now says: ``They're taking the violence
they used to use against the British and the security forces, and
they're turning it on their own community. They're thugs, scum.''
</P>
<P>
   She has cooperated with the police, though that has usually
brought retribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to the police in these neighborhoods, and you have a
petrol bomb through your window the next day,'' Peden said.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest wish is to get the money to leave his neighborhood
and into a bungalow so he can more easily get around. One of his
stumps is infected so he cannot yet wear the artificial legs he has
been fitted for.
</P>
<P>
   His son Gary, 15, recently alarmed him by saying that he would
kill the men who had maimed him. ``I've got to get him out of
here,'' Peden said, with desperation in his voice. ``I don't want
him to become part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the attack on her husband, Linda Peden had a tolerance
for the punishment beatings typical of working-class neighborhoods
in Belfast. ``You never approved of them, but you felt the victim
had done something wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has met with representatives of the militia that beat her
husband, and she said they now concede that the attack was a
mistake. ``But what good is that after he has been left with half a
body?'' she asked. ``We haven't got a life now. I even have to lift
him on and off the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   Though taking ``effective steps'' to prevent punishment beatings
was one of the written principles endorsed by all the parties at
the peace talks as a condition of entry, leaders have routinely
ignored pleas to curb them.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, leaders of Sinn Fein, and
David Ervine, head of the Progressive Unionists, refused to attend
a meeting last month with Mo Mowlam, the British Secretary for
Northern Ireland, when they learned the subject was the surge in
punishment beatings.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that even a resolution of the remaining problems
confronting the peace agreement, hoped for by the end of this
month, will put an end to the vigilante acts. ``It's unfortunately
the kind of violence that this society has learned to tolerate,''
Cushnahan said. ``It only affects working class areas, and people
in what I call the leafy suburbs aren't effected by it.''
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary groups argue that the beatings respond to
community pressure for crime control in the absence of a trusted
police force. But with the continuing perversion of the
paramilitary's enforcement and with reforms coming to the police
force, cynicism is making inroads into that longtime tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say we have peace, and the bombings may have stopped, but
the rest goes on,'' said James Peden, Andrew Peden's uncle.
``There's no peace here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kearney commented, ``When peace was declared, people
expected peace. Now you don't know whose house violence is going to
come to next.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that her son's killers will ever be arrested,
because no one will produce the needed evidence. But she says she
is determined to fight for an end to the beatings, and she says she
has received lots of private support from her cowed neighbors, if
not any public show of it.
</P>
<P>
   She set her jaw, tossed her white hair and thrust her finger
toward the window looking out on the distant hillside where Andrew
is buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``The punishment gangs like to say, `It's just to let you know
that we haven't gone away,' '' Mrs. Kearney said. ``Well, I'm now
letting them know that I'm not going away.''

TEXAS BILL WOULD BENEFIT UNINSURED CHILDREN 10 AND UNDER  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Children aged 10 or younger who lack health care
coverage take the highest priority under a children's health
insurance plan adopted unanimously by a Senate panel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 445, which attempts to strike the middle ground in
the politically explosive issue of children's health care for the
working poor, could be taken up by the full Texas Senate next week,
its sponsor predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, tax dollars would pay health insurance premiums
from birth to age 10 if a child lives in a family with income up to
200 percent of the federal poverty level. That's $33,600 for a
family of four.
</P>
<P>
   A band of Democrats in the House, however, insist the plan must
cover all children at that poverty level, not just the youngest
ones, since federal money is available. The Senate plan doesn't go
that far, but leaves the door open for broader coverage later.
</P>
<P>
   Passions are running high as Republicans react to a warning that
55 House Democrats have signed a petition that health care for kids
is at least as important as tax breaks for the oil industry,
declared an emergency by Gov. George W. Bush. Some have threatened
to block the oil tax cut if their goals for children's health
coverage are not met.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good in my heart that we have an excellent product, a
responsible mechanism to address the needs of the uninsured
children of the state,'' Senate sponsor Mike Moncrief, D-Fort
Worth, said after the Senate Health Committee approved his bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a travesty to leave behind a legacy of
failure,'' he added, explaining that the state should proceed with
fiscal caution. ``I don't know of a greater opportunity Texas has
ever had or will ever have again to address the needs of so many,
not just in this generation, but in future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically, stakes are high.
</P>
<P>
   Texas ranks at least second in the nation for uninsured
children, and every dollar the state puts up for the Children's
Health Insurance Program (CHIP for short) would be matched with
three more from federal taxes. Plus, the state is sitting on a $2.5
billion budget surplus and $17.3 billion tobacco settlement, of
which $500 million a year is dedicated to children's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of Democrats believe that the problem of
uninsured children in Texas is an emergency that is equally as
important as the emergency the governor says exists in the oil
industry,'' said state Rep. Kevin Bailey, D-Houston, head of the
Legislative Study Group. ``Our goal is just to make sure children's
health is treated at least as importantly as the oil industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Bush has said he wants a clear signal from both the
House and Senate before deciding what approach to take.
</P>
<P>
   Under Moncrief's bill, children ages 11-18 would be covered only
if their families' incomes did not exceed 150 percent of poverty _
$26,300 for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, the federal health insurance for the poor, would
continue to cover children in families the same size with incomes
of $16,800 or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly hope the health of these children isn't going to
hinge on some political wheeling and dealing,'' said Lisa
McGiffert, a Consumers Union analyst who testified in support of
funding health coverage for all children in homes up to 200 percent
of the poverty line. ``It's about helping families who are working
and can't afford health insurance for their kids. It should stand
on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders estimate the insurance program would cost the
state $153 million for the first year, but in a worst-case scenario
could escalate up to $360 million a year as more people enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House Republicans are willing to pay for coverage of
children who are 8 years and younger in families with incomes up to
200 percent of the poverty level, said state Rep. Kenny Marchant,
R-Coppell.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he and other Republicans want to ``safeguard
against getting into a situation ... where the federal government
pulls its funding and we end up with an entitlement program.''

   Obviously, girl talk is not what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it was reasonable to conclude on Wednesday night when
Barbara Walters plied Monica Lewinsky with questions about her
compulsive tendency to talk about what she did with Bill Clinton.
``You told 10 other people you had this relationship with the
president,'' Walters exclaimed. ``I mean, Bigmouth! Why did you
want people to know?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I trusted my girlfriends implicitly,'' cooed Monica Lewinsky.
``And that's the kind of relationship I have with my close
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what? Is this kind of tell-all relationship with friends
another one of the former White House intern's infinite quirks? Or
is her intimate confessional style what young women are trading in
these days?
</P>
<P>
   The answer seems to be that girltalk these days is racier,
spares less, and spills more. Even at that, say those who study and
write about young women's relationships, the Monica Lewinsky brand
of chitchat _ in all its florid detailing, its frankness about
sexual pleasure, and its sheer repetition factor _ is gossip at its
most extreme. ``It's Monica out of control,'' says social critic
Camille Paglia, who often writes about women's sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there are no statistics ``to see if women are
confiding more than they used to be,'' observes Florence Isaacs,
author of the new book ``Toxic Friends/True Friends: How Your
Friends Can Make or Break your Health, Happiness, Family and
Career.''
</P>
<P>
   But everyone interviewed agreed that unlike men, most women have
a visceral need to share intimate and provocative details of their
lives with their closest friends. ``Girls like to bond in ways that
reveal their innermost secrets,'' says Paglia. ``It's an
addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for women it's like a tree falling in the forest. If
no one hears it, it didn't really fall,'' says Meghan Daum, 29, who
writes a monthly column on cultural issues for Self magazine. ``You
know when Monica said she had to replay the phone answering machine
message for her friends? Everyone does that. It's a huge part of
being female, it's a ritual. The relationship has to be
validated.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Lewinsky's bold sexuality doesn't seem beyond the norm to
those 30 and under. ``It's not unusual in that generation,'' says
30-year-old writer and social commentator Katie Roiphe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think women of her age are more in control of their
sexuality. This partly has to do with growing up in the last
glimmer of the sexual revolution. And I think that women in their
20s are more comfortable with the idea of sleeping with lots of
people than our mothers were,'' says Roiphe. ``People do talk about
sexual details. I don't think of that kind of sexual confession as
particularly unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course Lewinsky wasn't sharing just any old details. She was
getting down to the level of sperm and specific accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Yazel, 28, editor of the ``Friends'' page in Glamour
magazine, says, ``I was struck by the level of detail she would
tell friends about the cigar.''
</P>
<P>
   And everyone, it seems, was struck by how wide a net of ``best
friends'' Lewinsky cast. ``It doesn't seem surprising to me that
she would have confided to one or two close friends,'' says Roiphe.
``But the fact that she has these 10 best, best, best friends seems
to me most typical of the particular theatrical and needy emotional
type that Monica Lewinsky is. That says something about her, and
not a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the maturing process happens when you realize you
don't have to tell everyone,'' says Jane Larkworthy, 36, beauty
editor of Jane, a lifestyle magazine for 18- to 34-year-olds.
Because what you are really saying is, `See, I'm loved, I'm
attractive.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, laughs Larkworthy, ``I know lots of
respectable women who, if they had the chance to be intimate with
the president, would do it in a heartbeat. If nothing else, they'd
do it for the bragging rights.''

AT LONG LAST: STRIKES WILL BE STRIKES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Much yelping and other forms of verbal
disgust are expected to be heard across Florida and Arizona
starting today.
</P>
<P>
   Normal citizens should not be concerned, although a pair of ear
plugs might be necessary. Who wants to hear rich men cry?
</P>
<P>
   But all the commotion, if it occurs, will be about the game of
baseball attempting to do something unique. Like play by its own
set of rules. How revolutionary, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with spring training contests, the strike zone is
going up. Supposedly.
</P>
<P>
   For major-league hitters, that's almost the same as telling them
salaries are going down. I said almost.
</P>
<P>
   The point of silliness was reached in the postseason last fall.
``I'd say some of us \Rumpires\S got killed on TV,'' noted American
League umpire Durwood Merrill, referring to announcers making the
constant comparison of certain strike zones to a ``postage stamp.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can put this in the mail:
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade in baseball the strike zone for many
umpires has transformed pitchers into modern day William Tells.
They have to hit an apple to get a called strike.
</P>
<P>
   By rule, the strike zone is supposed to be letters _ or chest
high _ to knees. The book has read that way for only 100 years. But
if umpires suddenly started calling it correctly, the strike zone
for today's pitchers would look like the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball would also be a crisper, quicker and better game if the
strike zone would suddenly become the strike zone again. But such a
thing was attempted a couple of years ago in spring training and,
by the ruckus it created, you would have thought the IRS had
eliminated tax shelters for .300 hitters.
</P>
<P>
   But commissioner Bud Selig's office is better organized and
better baseball staffed than any time in the past five decades, so
...
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, who works under Selig after being the highly
respected general manager in Oakland, issued a new edict several
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The high strike, he told managers, would be called and enforced
starting in spring training and continuing in the regular season.
Way to be brave, Sandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to go up,'' said Merrill, a 23-year veteran who is
known for a liberal horizontal strike zone. ``But I can guarantee
you, the first week of the season, if we go up with the strike
zone, ejections are also going way up.''
</P>
<P>
   Umpires know well the ``hot spots'' for creating adversity with
players and managers. At the top of that list, Merrill said, is
calling a strike if a pitch is above the belly button.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's by far the biggest gripe we get,'' he said. ``You are
going to hear everything imaginable from the dugout, then you have
to stay on the dugout, and then they yell at you to get your head
out of their dugout, and you are telling them you aren't listening
to that stuff for nine innings, and then, of course, come the
ejections.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Merrill, a Hooks resident who is based out of Tampa in
spring training, be calling a higher strike today?
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what \RSelig's office\S wants, I'd love to go up,''
he said. ``But at the same time, is the commissioner's office going
to back us when Mo Vaughn, Juan Gonzalez, Rafael Palmeiro and
players like that are being run \Rejected\S in the first week of
the season? Because it's going to happen. The fans pay to see the
stars, not see us running them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers second baseman Mark McLemore said it will be interesting
today in Sarasota, where the Rangers open Grapefruit League play
against the Cincinnati Reds. And if the ``high'' strike becomes
reality, ``then I'm gonna start adjusting,'' he shrugged. ``I'm not
gonna like it, but it's all about the survival of the fittest. You
can scream all you want, and many hitters will, but if enforced,
the screaming will mean you won't be around very long. The umpires
won't take much of that.''
</P>
<P>
   As the strike zone started to shrink, beginning in the '70s,
hitters gladly accepted the favor. Pitchers, meanwhile, were forced
to concede any pitch above the belt, and a ridiculous trend took
root.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates is a manager who says none of his pitchers should
be making pitches in that area anyway. They are too hittable. But
on the flip side, the more strike zone a pitcher has to work with,
the more effective he becomes, even with the ``up'' pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Since all else has failed, why not simply revisit the rule book?
Let a strike be a strike and let the game move along at a more
rapid pace. It will work if Selig and Co. make it work.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe today we start finding out if the commissioner's office is
serious. If so, bring ear plugs.

   &UR; FEATURE STORIES  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   OSCARS-SHAKESPEARE (Los Angeles) _ Even before the nominations
for the 71st annual Academy Awards were announced on Feb. 9, the
Miramax the Disney-owned company's juggernaut was at work, spinning
journalists and spending lavishly on trade paper advertisements
promoting the films, notably ``Shakespeare in Love.'' The
nominations cemented the belief that ``Shakespeare in Love,'' a
charming romantic comedy, directed by John Madden and starring
Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes, had emerged as (italics)the(end
italics) rival to ``Saving Private Ryan'' for the best picture
award. The awards will be given, for the first time ever on a
Sunday evening, on March 21. By Bernard Weinraub. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ACADEMY-AWARDS (Undated) _ With only two weeks to go until the
Oscars, my local movie theater is running a promotional spot for
this year's Academy Awards show. There they are, all the memories _
James Cameron crowing, David Niven fielding the streaker, Cher
winning for ``Moonstruck'' in the bird headdress _ in a pitch meant
to trumpet Oscar's glory. ``It's the night that brings the whole
world together and sets Hollywood apart!'' the ad exclaims. Since
when do we need reminding? At the very least, America's love-hate
relationship with the most divine of traditional awards shows
should mean a red-circled date on the calendar. Yet each year, the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences comes closer to
weakening its franchise and its hold on our collective imagination.
By Janet Maslin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIAL-FILMS (New York) _ A series of millennial films from
seven countries entitled 2000 Seen By, opens in New York on Friday
for the first leg of a pre-millennial tour around the country. By
Karen Durbin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   20-DATES-FILM (Undated) _ For his first film, Myles Berkowitz
set up his camera and hoped for the worst. Inspired by Ross
McElwee's personal odyssey ``Sherman's March,'' a funny, rambling
first-hand account of that director's fraught relationship with
women, Berkowitz decided to film a series of his own dates. The
resulting movie, ``20 Dates,'' nudges real life along by
orchestrating its humorous situations. Closer in technique to MTV's
``Real World'' than to ``Sherman's March,'' it is cinema verite
that has slipped on a banana peel. By bending the rules to send up
the conventions of romance, Berkowitz, 36, produced a movie that
defies genre labels. By Ted Loos.(Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   MODERN-MUSEUM-FILMS (Undated) _ It wasn't your typical Al Pacino
movie, this small film about a celebrity-obsessed thug that the
box-office heavyweight had lovingly acted in and dug deep into his
pockets to produce. In fact, ``The Local Stigmatic'' never enjoyed
financial success, period, having landed on a dusty shelf after
Pacino, who spent four years editing and re-editing the film after
it was shot in 1985, failed to find a distributor. Pacino was loath
to abandon the work he considers his ``calling card.'' So he did
what a top-flight filmmaker might have done: he donated it to the
Museum of Modern Art. By Kathryn Stattuck. (Moved).

<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DANCEGALAXY (New York) _ Dance, like youth, may be wasted on the
young. That is one of the premises of DanceGalaxy, a new ballet
troupe founded by Judith Fugate and Medhi Bahiri, which makes its
formal New York debut on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater. Ms. Fugate
and Bahiri are part of a growing trend, in modern dance for the
most part, of providing showcases for the kind of burnished
artistry that comes only with age. By Jennifer Dunning. (Moved).

Nightingales'' ``The Hothouse'' and ``Bright Lights Big City.''

</P>
<P>
   SLY-OPERA (Undated) _ Like Verdi's ``Falstaff,'' which preceded
it on the boards of La Scala by nearly three and a half decades,
Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari's ``Sly'' plays fast and loose with
Shakespeare, in the process enriching the material almost past
recognition. Unlike Falstaff, who marched straight from
Shakespeare's quill onto the Great Stage of Archetypes, Sly is a
character even his begetter promptly forgot. But Giovacchino
Forzano, a man of letters and the theater active at La Scala in the
first half of this century, saw Sly's potential. A play resulted,
and eventually an opera, which receives its belated American
premiere on Wednesday at the Washington Opera. By Matthew
Gurewitsch. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SNAKEBIT-THEATER (Undated) _ David Marshall Grant's first play,
``Snakebit,'' which reopens Monday at the Century Center for the
Performing Arts in New York City, seems to succeed in keeping
things small. Peter Marks, writing in The New York Times, called
the play ``the intimate sort of Off Broadway theater that has you
picking apart the characters long after the curtain falls.'' Not
that you would want to trade places with any of the central
characters in ``Snakebit''; they are all at various stages of
anxiety or depression. By Jesse Mckinley. (Moved). Photo. &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BAND-IN-BERLIN-THEATER (New York) _ Broadway is new territory
for Susan Feldman. Not that she works far away: she is the director
of the well-known Arts at St. Ann's program in Brooklyn Heights.
Nor is she a stranger to music theater. She has produced and
commissioned a range of work since 1979, including ``Songs for
'Drella,'' Lou Reed and John Cale's piece about Andy Warhol. But
Arts at St. Ann's, at the Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity,
is more commonly associated with the Brooklyn Academy of Music than
with Broadway, and Ms. Feldman is thought of more as a producer of
other people's work than as the creator of her own. Nevertheless,
after a long incubation period, she has conceived, written and
co-directed her first Broadway show. Entitled ``Band in Berlin,''
it opens Sunday night at the Helen Hayes Theater. By Anne Midgette.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   OPERA-LANGUAGE (Undaterd) _ Why is it that Americans (with
splendid exceptions) are valued internationally more for their
usefulness and versatility than for intimate personal contact with
Verdi or Puccini? And why do Italians, often with sketchy musical
backgrounds and faulty technique, sometimes penetrate their roles
more convincingly. The question is easy to answer. Italian is the
Italian's language, and Puccini begins with words. Melody, harmony
and rhythm are his way of getting words off the printed page and
into our ears. Italian singers don't imitate their language's
distinctive vowels and consonants; the right sound is a birthright.
And when a word in a libretto bears specific emotional baggage, the
Italian shapes it without thinking. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   COSI-FAN-TUTTE-OPERA (Undated) _ Many Mozart experts and opera
buffs will no doubt dismiss a recent release of ``Cosi Fan Tutte''
from Sony Classical with a knowing huff. It is a reissue of a 1952
recording, with Fritz Stiedry conducting the orchestra and chorus
of the Metropolitan Opera Association, as it was then called
(Masterworks Heritage MH2K 60652; two CDs). So what's the problem?
Mozart's opera, written in Italian, is performed in English. ``Cosi
Fan Tutte'' becomes ``Women Are Like That.'' And the recitatives
are accompanied not by a historically appropriate harpsichord or
fortepiano, as they would be today, but by a modern piano. Yet the
recording is a joy. The pleasure comes partly from nostalgia. By
Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TAKEMITSU-MUSIC (Undated) _ The Japanese composer Toru
Takemitsu, who died three years ago, often likened his pieces to
gardens: specifically Japanese gardens, made to be admired at a
strolling pace, with frequent stops to enjoy, perhaps, the foliage
of a tree, or a flower, or a spider's web, or a distant view.
Certainly, the analogy fits almost everything he wrote, whatever
the style (and there were many), but his music's customary slow
andante may have come from a deeper inkling into how we listen. By
Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRY-CLASSICAL (Undated) _ Country has long been packaged as
the classical music of simple American folks. The transformation of
hillbilly entertainment into an official repository of our national
traditions has extended from the fancy naming of the Grand Ole Opry
in 1927 to the appointment of William Ivey, the director of the
Country Music Hall of Fame, to the chair of the National Endowment
for the Arts in 1998. Country music finds its real power in the
tension between nostalgia and the need for change, a contradiction
mined on two new albums. ``The Mountain,'' by Steve Earle with the
Del McCoury Band, investigates country's most classical form,
bluegrass. ``What I Deserve,'' by Kelly Willis, takes a more
eclectic approach. By Ann Powers. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BECKER-PHOTOGS (Los Angeles) _ Harold Becker, a former
commercial photographer in New York, used a restored 1920s camera
more than 30 years ago to take a series of abstract portraits of
the female form. An exhibition of his work opened in Los Angeles
last month at the New Alchemy Gallery. The show is the fifth in a
series titled ``Still/Moving'' and runs through April 6. Since last
May, it has been a showcase for the still photography of Hollywood
professionals, for the most part cinematographers. By David Hay.
(Moved).

<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-JEWS-WOMEN (Undated) _ About 30 Jewish professionals in
television and film a year ago organized the Morning Star
Commission under the auspices of Hadassah to work toward changing
Jewish women's stereotypical image on Televison. By Joseph Hanania.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-PAYNE (Undated) _ John Larroquette has found a fresh host
body for his patented brand of blowhard. In the 1980s, Larroquette
won four Emmys for his portrayal of the pompous, philandering
assistant prosecutor Dan Fielding in ``Night Court.'' This time, in
the new CBS sitcom ``Payne,'' he is an innkeeper in northern
California who views his wife, his employees and his guests as
impediments to his ultimate goal. ``To be the ultimate guest,''
Larroquette explained. By Charles Strum. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KIASMA-ARCH-ANTIQUES (Helsinki, Finland) _ At a time when much
new architecture is almost interchangeable from country to country,
the Kiasma Museum in Helsinki is distinctive for the way it
expresses the national character of Finland and its landscape. The
name itself describes an intertwining of genetic material, but here
it takes on a more metaphoric meaning, evoking the confluence of
the urban streets that surround the museum. By Paula Deitz.

U.S. IS MAKING BIG PUSH TO HAVE KOSOVO PEACE DEAL READY BY MARCH

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia_ The Clinton administration is unleashing
what it hopes will be a speedy diplomatic offensive to salvage the
Kosovo peace proposal in an effort to avoid a reprise of the
previous inconclusive round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to have a deal ready to sign by March 15. But
officials say that if this proves too ambitious, they hope at least
to have the ethnic Albanians' agreement pinned down by the time the
talks are scheduled to resume in France and to know exactly where
the main impediment to a settlement, the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, stands.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Milosevic has stood on the sidelines in Belgrade,
building his forces in and around Kosovo and watching as the threat
of NATO air strikes against him subsided after the earlier talks in
Rambouillet, France. But Thursday night he put up his first
obstacle to the new American offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has enlisted former Sen. Bob Dole, a champion
of the ethnic Albanian cause, to go to Kosovo to try to persuade
the ethnic Albanians to agree to the settlement that they balked at
signing more than a week ago in Rambouillet. Milosevic, however,
has denied Dole a visa to enter Yugoslavia, so he planned instead
to have his meetings with ethnic Albanian leaders in Skopje, the
Macedonian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in the wings is a special envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke,
who, officials said, was asked by the administration this week to
take the settlement, after the ethnic Albanians have signed it, to
Milosevic for approval. The Yugoslav leader has continued to object
strenuously to the main element of the plan: deploying 28,000
NATO-led peacekeepers, including 4,000 American soldiers, in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the renewed efforts, the administration appears less
than certain that the strategy would fall into place.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to tackle Milosevic as soon as possible cannot get off
the ground until agreement is won from the ethnic Albanians, who
proved at Rambouillet to be unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright indicated the
uncertainties Thursday night after arriving in Indonesia at the end
of a three-country trip in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see whether this process will be successful this
time,'' Albright said of Dole's mission at a news conference here.
Of the ethnic Albanians, she said, ``I don't know when they are
going to sign.''
</P>
<P>
   On her first visit to Indonesia as secretary of state, Albright
has traveled here to encourage the Indonesians to hold free and
fair elections on June 7. The first multiparty elections since 1955
occur as Indonesia, the country hit hardest by the Asian financial
crisis, is undergoing economic and ethnic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Albright arrived, students who are calling for
President B.J. Habibie to resign clashed with baton-wielding police
officers in downtown Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   As Albright traveled from China to Thailand and now here, Kosovo
has remained high on her agenda. It appeared quite likely that if
Dole were successful in his mission, Albright would change her
plans and fly to Brussels to meet him and the supreme commander of
NATO, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's plans have not been decided, Albright said Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   A Serbian newspaper that is tightly controlled by Milosevic,
Politika, said on Thursday that Holbrooke would arrive in Belgrade
``within days.''
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of a swift success by Dole was cast into doubt by
Milosevic's actions. In the last several weeks his troops have been
blocking the borders with Macedonia, which will make it difficult
for the ethnic Albanian leaders to slip out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After the setback at Rambouillet, where the ethnic Albanians
rebuffed Albright and Clark, the administration began its concerted
campaign to win them over and to make as much progress as possible
before the talks resume.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of holding the talks at a French air base in Normandy, a
situation that could lead to another set of rambling
Rambouillet-like negotiations, the administration is trying to
persuade the French to hold the talks in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy national security adviser, James Steinberg, met the
eight-member board of the National Albanian American Council on
Wednesday. According to the executive director of the council, Ilir
Zherka, this was an effort to ensure that the council used its
influence to have the leaders of the guerrilla movement in Kosovo
sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A main concern of the ethnic Albanians, Zherka said, was that
Milosevic would be given the opportunity to wring concessions out
of the peace plan after the ethnic Albanians had signed it.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg reassured the group that if Milosevic demanded
concessions, the ethnic Albanians would have to give their approval
or the peace plan would be dead, Zherka said. ``If the Albanians
say no to changes, then that's the end of it,'' Zherka quoted
Steinberg as having said.

<P>
   Dole sought a commitment from Albright that if he won an
agreement from the ethnic Albanians, the plan would not be subject
to the whims of Milosevic, according to Mira Baratta, a senior
adviser to Dole.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conversation on Thursday morning, Albright told
Dole that there could be no ``material'' changes to the peace plan
by Milosevic, Ms. Baratta said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who has been sympathetic to the ethnic Albanians since
visiting Kosovo in 1990 and seeing the Serbian repression there,
will be accompanied by a senior State Department official, Jim
O'Brien, and a general from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Ms. Baratta
said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, a lawyer who has been involved in the fine print of the
peace proposal, will be taking with him a document ready for
signing. The proposal calls for a three-year interim period of
autonomy for Kosovo, now a province of Serbia, and for the
withdrawal of Serbian forces and the demilitarization of the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Dole plans to meet the leadership of the guerrilla movement, as
well as civilian leaders who represent a broad spectrum in Kosovo.
Dole would meet Hashim Thaci, the leader of the ethnic Albanian
delegation at Rambouillet who, the Kosovo Liberation Army announced
this week, would be the prime minister of an unofficial provisional
government.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci was a holdout at Rambouillet, refusing to sign the peace
proposal, apparently because it did not include a referendum on
independence after three years. A referendum, which is anathema to
Milosevic, would undoubtedly result in an overwhelming victory for
supporters of independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dole would like the plan signed as soon as possible, because
the delay is taking the pressure off Milosevic,'' Ms. Baratta said.
``It's his intention to walk away with the signatures.''
</P>
<P>
   As an inducement to sign the plan, the administration invited
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army to travel to Washington next
week for talks on how the United States could establish relations
with the little-understood group. Among other visits, the
guerrillas would be invited to the Pentagon, one of their advisers
said.
</P>
<P>
   But several American advisers to the ethnic Albanians said that
Thaci and the other guerrillas who were at Rambouillet remained as
enigmatic as they were nine days ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ MediaNews Group Inc. announced Thursday that its Garden
State Newspapers affiliate and Donrey Media Group, which is owned
by Stephens Group Inc. of Little Rock, &UR;  &LR; Ark., have agreed to expand
their previously &UR;  &LR; announced California partnership to include the
San Bernardino Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership will be managed by MediaNews.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun, owned by Gannett, the nation's largest newspaper
company, will be contributed to the partnership, adding 80,040
daily and 88,589 Sunday circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addition of The Sun to our group will consolidate the
rapidly growing Inland Empire region of the Los Angeles newspaper
market and allow better and more efficient service to our readers
and advertisers,'' said William Dean Singleton, president and CEO
of MediaNews and Garden State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very excited about what this will bring to our
California group.''
</P>
<P>
   Ike Massey, president and CEO of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group
and publisher of the Daily News of Los Angeles, will be in charge
of the partnership's Southern California division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing the San Bernardino Sun into the partnership will give
the Los Angeles Newspaper Group more than 585,000 daily circulation
and more than 623,000 Sunday circulation,'' Massey said. ``Our
newspapers will reach across Los Angeles and San Bernardino
counties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Participation in California Newspapers Partnership provides
Gannett with the opportunity to better serve readers and
advertisers all across the Inland Empire,'' said Gary Watson,
president of Gannett's newspaper division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our decision in January to enter into a strategic partnership
with MediaNews Group, on its own, was a good one. That partnership
decision just got better with the addition of Gannett,'' said
Jackson T. Stephens, chairman of Stephens Group Inc., owner of
Donrey Media.
</P>
<P>
   Garden State announced the formation of the partnership on Jan.
12 with Donrey. An agreement was reached this week to include
Gannett.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement as previously announced, Garden
State will contribute its Alameda Newspaper Group, which comprises
six daily newspapers published in the San Francisco Bay area; its
San Gabriel Valley Newspaper Group, which includes the San Gabriel
Valley Tribune, the Pasadena Star-News and the Whittier Daily News;
and the Times-Standard, a daily in Eureka.
</P>
<P>
   Donrey will contribute 10 daily newspapers and two nondaily
newspapers in California, most located close to Garden State
newspapers, including the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin in Ontario,
The Times-Herald in Vallejo, the Enterprise-Record in Chico, the
Hemet News, the Daily Democrat in Woodland, the Lompoc Record, the
Ukiah Daily Journal, the Red Bluff Daily News, the Mercury-News in
Oroville, the Redlands Daily Facts, the Advocate-News in Fort Bragg
and the Valley Times in Moreno Valley. Gannett will contribute the
San Bernardino Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Upon closing, the partnership will publish 21 daily newspapers
with daily circulation of 611,040 and Sunday circulation of
581,589.
</P>
<P>
   Garden State also owns and publishes the Daily News and the Long
Beach Press-Telegram. Those newspapers, with a combined daily
circulation of some 308,000, will not be contributed to the
partnership, but do operate as part of the Los Angeles Newspaper
Group.
</P>
<P>
   When the partnership transaction is completed later this month,
Garden State will publish 23 dailies in California with a combined
circulation in excess of 919,040 while Denver-based MediaMews
overall will publish a total of 51 daily newspapers and 119
nondaily publications in 13 states with daily circulation of more
than 1.8 million and nondaily circulation in excess of 2 million.

   &UR; Lynn Redgrave &LR; , 56, has filed for divorce after learning that
66-year-old  &UR; John Clark &LR; , her husband of 32 years, had fathered a
child by his personal assistant, who later married his son and
became his daughter-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really were one big happy family, of sorts,'' Clark told
the New York Daily News. It was last Thanksgiving, he said, that he
told Redgrave that the 4-year-old child was his. ``She was busy
cooking the turkey. We had guests. The entire holiday was pretty
awful.''
</P>

were so slow giving us grandkids. I had to make our own.'' (See Who

   _ The president gets romantic with Monica: ``If I were 25 years
old and not married, I would have you on the floor in three
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Monica says that when locked up with Starr's inquisitors, she
seriously considered jumping out the hotel window to commit
suicide, until she realized that FBI snipers that might be posted
on surrounding rooftops might shoot at her.

doing drugs, studying hard. ``Next time, shoplift,'' said Walters.

MARINE PILOT WHOSE PLANE CUT GONDOLA CABLE IN ITALY, KILLING 20, IS
ACQUITTED
</HEADLINE>
 (See also MARINE-REACT)  
(fe) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
 
  CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. _ A Marine Corps pilot whose plane cut a
gondola cable in Italy last year, sending 20 people to their
deaths, was acquitted of involuntary homicide and manslaughter on
Thursday by a jury that found no negligence even though the plane
was flying lower and faster than rules permitted.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pilot, Capt. Richard J. Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif.,
stood at attention to hear the verdict. There was no change in his
bearing as the president of the jury, Col. William T. Snow, said,
``This court finds you, of all the charges and specifications, not
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot's sister, Cary Lee Horsager, seated along with about
30 spectators in the spare military courtroom here, let out a
whoop. A prosecutor, Maj. Vernon S. Couch, turned to relatives of
three victims seated behind him to say, ``I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby's reaction was somber. ``Basically all I really want to
say is it's been a tragedy for all involved, and my heart and my
thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims of this
tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquittal also stunned and angered people in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby still faces charges of obstruction of justice, as does his
navigator, Capt. Joseph P. Schweitzer, 30, of Westbury, N.Y.,
because they allegedly concealed a videotape on which they had
recorded part of the flight and which investigators thought might
be useful to determine what happened. The whereabouts of that tape
is still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But after the verdict on Thursday, it was not certain whether
the Marines would still press homicide or manslaughter charges
against Schweitzer. During the flight on Feb. 3, 1998, Ashby sat at
the jet's single set of controls and Schweitzer sat to his right
and was the mission planner.
</P>
<P>
   Had Ashby been convicted, he faced up to 10 years in prison for
each death and would have been led directly to the brig. Instead,
the judge, Col. Robert Nunley, said, ``Captain Ashby is certainly
free to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17-day court-martial, along with pretrial hearings and two
Marine Corps investigations, made clear that lack of communications
led to the accident on the Mount Cermis gondola.
</P>
<P>
   But the verdict, delivered after seven hours of deliberations,
raised the possibility that the most serious punishments meted out
will have been against the squadron commander, who was relieved of
command, and the squadron's director of safety standardization, who
received a letter of reprimand that effectively ends his career.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the victims, German skiers who were on vacation,
were tearful and outraged on Thursday. Sindy Renkewitz, whose
father and sister were on the cable car, along with her sister's
fiance, said she had worried that the Marine Corps jury would not
convict one of their own. ``There's a saying in Germany; it says,
one crow doesn't pick out the eye of the other one,'' said Ms.
Renkewitz.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Wunderlich said through a translator, ``I buried my husband
a year ago. Today it was his second funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wunderlich, who was not present when Ashby spoke to
reporters after the verdict, said, ``If Mr. Ashby really feels
sorry and he told you so, why didn't he tell us?
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have looked into our eyes, but I don't know if he can
do that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my daughter had 20 persons on her conscience, it doesn't
matter whether guilty or innocent, I don't know if I could have
entered the courtroom,'' Ms. Wunderlich went on. ``And then I don't
know if she were declared innocent, if I could have screamed out of
joy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every normal person would have said he's guilty; it's only the
members of the jury and his defense attorneys who think that he was
innocent, and I cannot understand that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was supposed to stay 1,000 feet above the ground but
hit the cables at about 360 feet.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the acquittal was no surprise; a hearing officer who
conducted eight days of hearings last year in a proceeding loosely
equivalent to a civilian grand jury, warned that convicting the
crew would be difficult because many parties were at fault.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A key question before the jury was whether Ashby's conduct
matched that of a ``reasonable pilot'' in the same or similar
circumstances. Investigations after the crash showed that hardly
anybody in the squadron could describe the rules correctly and that
the American charts, used by the Marines and the Air Force, did not
show the ski lift.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the plane may have had problems with its radar
altimeter, which measures distance above the ground. The crew,
flying the plane through typically aggressive maneuvers meant to
stay below the mountaintops and thus simulate radar evasion, may
have been flying the plane in a way that rendered the radar
altimeter useless, although they were relying on it to keep them
safe.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the acquittal was an indictment of the Marine
Corps' training, equipment, management and procedures, as well as
certain aspects of Air Force operations. Communications between the
Air Force squadron resident at Aviano and the Prowler squadrons
that rotated through were poor.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction prosecution, if it is successful, could lead to
a sentence of up to one year. But Frank Spinner, the civilian
lawyere representing Ashby, said he would appeal to Lt. Gen. Peter
Pace, the commander of Marine Forces, Atlantic, who ordered the
court-martial in the first place, to consider a less formal
disciplinary procedure that would result in a smaller punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Hiding the tape was ``regrettable,'' he said, ``but I don't
think it rises to the level of obstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Marines, Maj. Scott B. Jack, said Thursday
afternoon that ``the trial counsel is continuously re-evaluating
the aspects of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby testified during the trial that it was his camera but
Schweitzer's tape. He said that Schweitzer did not use the camera
during the low-level portion of the flight, when the accident
occurred, and that he had taken the tape from the plane and later
given it to Schweitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Spinner told reporters that the verdict showed that the crash
was a training accident, not a crime. ``I think it's time, now that
the truth has come out in the court room, for the Marine Corps to
look back, at how this trial came about,'' he said. ``And I think
it's time for Congress perhaps to look at the Marine Corps once all
these issues are resolved and perhaps look at what went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it that the Marine Corps could claim that Captain Ashby
committed an act of involuntary manslaughter, recklessness, and how
is it that a jury could acquit him of those same charges and even
lesser charges?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction charge was added after the original charges, and
Ashby elected to face that in a second court-martial. Schweitzer
agreed to face all the charges at once. David Beck, who is
Schweitzer's civilian lawyer, said Thursday afternoon that he would
ask that the charges be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby was acquitted on 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter,
which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years per count, and lesser
charges of destruction of government property and private property.
Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the crash was a crime
if the pilot was negligent and an accident if he was not.
</P>
<P>
   If the jury had voted to convict, the relatives would have been
asked to testify in a ``penalty phase'' about the impact of the
accident on their lives. Their American lawyers are seeking special
legislation in Congress to compensate them; the Pentagon has told
them to pursue their claims through the Italian courts, a process
that the lawyers say will take eight to 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has, however, appropriated $20 million to rebuild the
ski lift.

BILLIONAIRE AGREES TO RETURN ANCIENT COINS TO TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Capitulating to claims that he was hoarding ancient
treasure, billionaire William I. Koch says he will deliver nearly
1,700 coins to the Republic of Turkey, settling a massive lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement came a full decade after the lawsuit was filed in
Boston federal court, and was somewhat unexpected: Koch, a
businessman and America's Cup winner with a history of waging
lengthy lawsuits, had insisted that the coins rightfully belonged
to him and his two partners _ and won support for his claim from a
former curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The Turkish
government, meanwhile, represented by New York attorney Lawrence M.
Kaye, had vowed not to relent until the entire hoard had been
returned.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's settlement was a clear indication of the strength
of the Turkish case, and signified a great victory for Turkish
officials, who have made a 10-year crusade out of retrieving lost
artifacts and works of art. Under the agreement, Turkey will get
the coins; Koch, in return, will have his name carved into a plaque
where the coins will be displayed in Turkey, with a statement that
reads: ``With special appreciation for the American businessman
William I. Koch.''
</P>
<P>
   The coins include Athenian decadrachmas some 2,000 years old,
according to the Turkish government, which are believed to be worth
several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The treasure _ variously described as the ``Elmali Hoard,''
after the region in southern Turkey where it was found, and the
``King Tut of numismatics discoveries'' by experts in the classics
world _ has been in dispute virtually ever since it was unearthed
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Three peasant farmers discovered the collection with nothing
more than a handheld metal detector, then cleaned the coins and
sold them to well-known coin smugglers in the Grand Bazaar in
Istanbul, according to Turkish officials. The peasants were caught
and prosecuted; the coins, meanwhile, made their way out of Turkey
and into foreign hands, in violation of Turkish law.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Turkish government began an international hunt in
pursuit of the collection, the coins were scattered around the
globe, with some landing as far away as Los Angeles, in the
possession of former LA Kings owner Bruce McNall. McNall later
returned his coins, when the Turkish government noisily protested.
But Koch and his partners, who had bought the vast majority of the
coins for approximately $3 million, did not.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Koch and his two partners, Jeffrey Spier and Jonathan
H. Kagan, refused to publicly acknowledge the coins had even come
from southern Turkey, and at no point during the dispute publicly
admitted they were in the wrong. In a statement provided for a
Globe article about the hoard last December, Koch insisted the
coins were not the same ones claimed by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the defendants' claims that the coins were not the
lost Turkish hoard was Cornelius C. Vermeule III, the curator of
the classical art department at the MFA for nearly 40 years before
retiring in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After learning from Kagan, a partner at the investment firm of
Lazard Freres, that he might be able to buy the coins, Koch turned
to the MFA to get them authenticated. Vermeule, an idiosyncratic
expert known for his sharp memory and his fluency in seven
languages, examined the hoard and encouraged Koch to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, however, Vermeuele received a letter from a
bank manager in Switzerland, warning him that Turkish officials
were searching for the illegally-smuggled hoard. But rather than
warn Koch against the purchase, Vermeule sent the billionaire a
letter advising just the opposite. Koch apparently did not hesitate
before buying the coins.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 years that followed, one problem arose after the next.
Several dealers became suspicious of the coins. Then two Turkish
journalists, Meylik Keylan and Ozgen Acar, wrote a story about the
hoard for Connoisseur Magazine, informing the art world that one of
the great coin discoveries of the world had been ferreted out of
its native land and hidden in an American businessman's vault.
Three years later, in 1989, Turkey filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Koch _ who last made headlines in Boston when he sued his
mistress, Catherine de Castelbajac, in housing court, for refusing
to leave his Four Seasons penthouse _ Thursday accepted an
invitation from the Turkish Ministry of Culture to travel to Turkey
for a ceremony returning the coins. In a statement, he neither
admitted guilt nor accepted the Turkish government's claim that the
coins originated in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Koch said: ``I want the Turkish people to enjoy these
coins for years to come.''

UMASS HEADS HOME AFTER LOSS TO XAVIER, 72-68

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Next week, the NCAA and National Invitation
Tournaments begin and it will seem unusual not spotting the
University of Massachusetts Minutemen in either one. For nine
years, their presence in postseason play had become almost a given.
You figured that no matter how poor they played or how many
on-court or off-court problems they faced, their march toward
postseason would not be disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   It took 10 seasons, but the Minutemen, who went from perennial
laughingstock during most of the 1980's to a Final Four squad in
1995-96, find themselves associated with two words few figured
would be attached to the program this season.
</P>
<P>
   Full circle.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier ended UMass' season of unfulfilled expectations Thursday.
The Musketeers jumped to a 17-point first-half lead then staved off
a dramatic rally for a 72-68 victory in the Atlantic 10 tournament
quarterfinals. The loss assured the last UMass team of the 1990s
would be the only one this decade to post a losing record and fail
to reach a national postseason tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier guard Lenny Brown tied a season high with 31 points and
teammates James Posey (17 points) and Gary Lumpkin (6) hit two free
throws each over the last 58 seconds to save the Musketeers (21-9),
who all but assured themselves an NCAA Tournament bid with the
victory. Xavier meets Temple, a 64-51 winner over Virginia Tech, in
Friday's semifinal round.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen (14-16) played without starting senior point guard
Charlton Clarke, who aggravated a stress fracture in his right foot
in Tuesday's first-round victory over Duquesne. ``I made the
decision not to play right before the game,'' said Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I iced it all night, but I could not lift my feet up off the
ground. I tried to be psychological about it and say I've got to go
out and play, but I didn't want to hurt the team any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore guard Jonathan DePina (4 points, 3 assists, 3 steals,
4 turnovers in 25 minutes) started for Clarke and was spelled by
sophomore guard Rafael Cruz (2 points, 6 assists, 1 steal, 2
turnovers in 15 minutes). They gave the Minutemen better play at
the point than they could have expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good being out there,'' said DePina. ``I knew I was
going to get a lot of playing time, so my confidence was up. I just
went out there and tried my hardest.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the rest of the Minutemen in a desperate attempt to keep
the season going. Senior center Lari Ketner had 11 points and 15
rebounds in his last collegiate game, junior guard Monty Mack had
18 points and 6 rebounds, and junior forward Chris Kirkland had a
team-high 22 points and 10 boards.
</P>
<P>
   But UMass was done in by similar woes that have plagued them all
season, namely a slow start and lapses in focus and composure.
Ketner picked up a technical foul with 11:06 left in the first half
and two subsequent free throws by Brown were part of a 10-0 run
that gave Xavier a 19-10 lead. The Musketeers increased the lead to
41-24 with 1:37 left and led, 41-30, at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned the ball over too much in the first half,'' said
UMass coach Bruiser Flint. ``But in the second half we settled
down, made some plays, and got back in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Mack's 15 second-half points, the Minutemen slowly
whittled away at Xavier's lead, which topped out at 16 after
intermission. Still, they missed opportunities down the stretch to
claim a dramatic upset. With 1:20 left, and UMass trailing, 67-64,
Mack attempted a putback layup that got stuck between the rim and
the backboard. The possession arrow gave the ball to Xavier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself that's just how the season has been, a wedge
between the rim and the basket,'' said Flint.
</P>
<P>
   After a free throw by Brown increased the lead to 4 with 57.4
seconds left, UMass junior forward Winston Smith scored to cut the
lead to 68-66 with 38 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Lumpkin sank two free throws with 26.9 seconds to go to put the
lead back at 4. When Mack scored with 17.1 seconds left to cut the
lead to 2 again, Posey followed with two more free throws with 13.7
to go for the final margin.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, both Ketner and Clarke walked to the locker
room in tears. Ketner, who hurt his NBA draft chances with a subpar
season, said he has been invited to the Desert Classic in Phoenix,
an invitational for players seeking to improve their draft status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my last game, and I wish I could have shared it with
Charlton,'' said Ketner. ``We didn't plan to go home today, but the
guys played hard.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Flint, he will spend the offseason trying to formulate a
plan to make sure this season isn't duplicated. The coach said it
will seem unusual being at home during the NCAA and NIT
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be even more unusual watching the games,'' he said.

 &HT;    Stars ablaze in amiable `Annie'
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' which opened on Broadway
last night, Bernadette Peters finally has the sun-splashed,
melody-rich, girl-gets-boy musical that she has always deserved. At
50-going-on-30, the pocket goddess has no trouble commanding the
boys' attention, and in the strapping baritone Tom Wopat, she
finally has one worth getting.
</P>
<P>
   And Broadway at last _ just two months before the Tony Award
cutoff _ will have its first bona-fide hit musical of the season,
if there's any justice.
</P>
<P>
   That's a big if, however, considering that some elements of this
revival don't come close to the stars' level. If Peters and Wopat
weren't onstage so much, this Graciela Daniele production might
seem plastic and pat. Aside from a few witty, athletic dance turns
(choreography by Daniele and Jeff Calhoun), the show behind the two
stars is merely OK.
</P>
<P>
   Irving Berlin was once asked if he wrote songs for posterity and
answered, ``No, for prosperity.'' He was too modest; in ``Annie''
he did both. Working from a lively but not outstanding book about
the romance of 19th-century sharpshooters Annie Oakley and Frank
Butler, Berlin capped his career with one of the great scores in
Broadway history.
</P>
<P>
   The 1946 show is best remembered for the joyously explosive
voice of Ethel Merman, who, in ``There's No Business Like Show
Business,'' famously hit the ``No'' and ``Show'' notes of the song
like Annie blasting clay pigeons out of the sky. But the show was
also tailored for another Merman quality, or lack of it: sex
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A revised book by the perennially overrated Peter Stone
(``Titanic'') is intended to clean up now-unacceptable attitudes.
The song ``I'm an Indian, Too'' has been axed; other cartoony
depictions of Native Americans might have been corrected by cutting
a few lines. But Stone bends over backward to give Sitting Bull and
the other Indians lots of weak jokes at the expense of the
palefaces, in the same way that TV children are always more clever
than their TV dads.
</P>
<P>
   Stone handled the gender issue more gracefully. Annie still
stoops to conquer, wins Frank's heart by letting him have the
lion's share of the sharpshooting glory, but Frank is rewritten
just enough that one sees a '90s-style man behind his tough old
chauvinist hide. While Wopat sings with deliberate sappiness of an
``Old-Fashioned Wedding,'' Peters struts around singing her faster
counterpoint about big, loud nuptials, making it clear that her
submissiveness was just an act to get him down the aisle. (The
number is so funny that the preview crowd called for two encores.)
This Annie suggests that as a wife she may be closer to
Shakespeare's Kate: a shrew untamed.
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of a lesser performer, this deception would
backfire. But Peters pulls it off, keeps the character lovable,
radiating a sensuality without surrender. Wopat, in addition to his
fine voice, has a buccaneerish masculinity far beyond the Ken dolls
who pass for musical leads these days. When the hourglass-shaped
Peters huskily murmurs, ``I just want to be near you, Frank,'' it's
not the laugh line of a lovesick puppy _ it's an offer no
red-blooded male can refuse.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the sparkling innocence of Peters, even more than her
allure, that lights the stage. ``I Got the Sun in the Morning'' has
been given a slower, swing tempo that better suits her voice, but
the song's simple message _ more spiritual than it gets credit for
_ shines through. Peters can play the tomboy clown, but it's in her
transformation to a graceful, stunning Victorian belle that she
steps from Merman's shadow. Peters has a great brass instrument of
a voice, but with a sweeter, melting quality that lends new magic
to ``Moonshine Lullaby'' and ``They Say It's Wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Clasping her hands to her chest on the cresting notes of the
latter, proclaiming love to be wonderful, wonderful, you have
absolutely no doubt that she knows it, and feels it.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Georgia singers don't make finals in opera tryouts
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Neither winner of the Georgia district Metropolitan
Opera auditions will be going to New York for the finals in April.
The regional auditions, bringing together the winners from Georgia,
Florida and the Carolinas, were held last weekend at the Lovett
School in Atlanta, and the Georgians were outflanked by singers
from the neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Marie Chavez, 28, a mezzo from Florida, and Laura
Ingram, 29, a soprano from North Carolina, tied for top honors and
will represent the Southeast region. Judges Paul Kilmer, artistic
administrator of the Opera Theater of St. Louis, Gail Robinson of
the Metropolitan Opera and Beverly Wolff, a voice teacher at
Florida Southern College, declined to name a first- or second-place
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Adina Aaron, 26, a soprano from Florida, won third place, and
Cynthia Watters, 24, a soprano from Carrollton, won an
encouragement award.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  STRINGERS: Jeffrey Schoyen, assistant
</P>
<P>
   professor of strings at the University of Nebraska
</P>
<P>
   in Kearney, wrote to praise William Pleeth,
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline du Pre's teacher. In the credits of the
Oscar-nominated film ``Hilary and Jackie,'' he is listed as a
nameless ``cello teacher.'' He was, in fact, the largest reason _
beyond her natural talent _ for du Pre's artistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a teacher,'' says Schoyen, who studied with him, ``Pleeth
is as inspiring as du Pre was as a player. His imagination had no
boundaries, and he would encourage me not to blindly accept a
traditional interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of open thinking is obvious in the musical showmanship
of his showiest student, and it's presented in stark contrast (in
the film) to the Royal College of Music flute teacher who kills off
the musical gifts of Hilary du Pre, Jacqueline's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Schoyen, an Atlanta native, said another fine Atlanta cellist,
Lawrence Foster, studied with Pleeth. Foster was shot and killed in
the city in 1980. Pleeth, now in his 80s, still maintains an active
teaching schedule in London.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ALMOST A NEW FACE: William L. Baites, formerly interim
director of the Rialto Center for the Performing Arts, is now the
official director. Baites previously was director of the concert
series at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  DOVE AND CROW: The piece Marietta Simpson sang at the Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra's Jan. 29 tribute concert to Robert Shaw is
generally known as ``Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child.''
The arrangement of this familiar spiritual for alto and choir, by
Shaw and Alice Parker, is titled ``Sometimes I Feel Like a Moanin'
Dove.'' Thanks to reader John B. White Jr. for his interest and
research.

 &HT;    Magazine that changed the way America looks at celebrities turns
25
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   People, ``the mother of all human interest magazines,'' is
celebrating its 25th anniversary by taking over the world, or at
least the newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity-studded weekly, which in 1974 invented
``personality journalism'' and changed the definition of news, is
the most lucrative weekly in the country, earning, it says, even
more than big brother Time.
</P>
<P>
   People discovered, way back in 1974, that Americans were hungry
for the dish on Burt and Dinah; Cher and Gregg; Andy and Fergie.
Unlike the Hollywood fan mags and tabloids, People covered
celebrities with Time's hard-news sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Today, mainstream media is following People's lead. Newsweeklies
profile rock stars. Women's service magazines feature the faces of
Oprah Winfrey and Julia Roberts out front, whereas 20 years ago,
``their covers were chocolate cakes,'' says former People managing
editor Richard Stolley.
</P>
<P>
   In its wake came the entertainment media boom. Magazines (Us,
the revamped Vanity Fair, Entertainment Weekly); television shows
(``Enter-
</P>
<P>
   tainment Tonight''); and an entire cable channel _ the E!
Network _ were inspired or made possible by People's success.
</P>
<P>
   Even USA Today took a page from People's approach, with its
short stories and multiple photographs, says Samir Husni, professor
of journalism at the University of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   People has done its own proliferating, spinning off publications
on celebrity fashion and housing (the remarkably successful
InStyle), teen celebrities (Teen People), and Spanish-speaking
celebrities (People En Espanol.). Even People's spinoffs have
imitators, witnessed by the new InStyle wannabes, Celebrity Style
and McCall's brand new (launched Feb. 23) StarStyle.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that the apotheosis of modern celebrity,
Princess Diana, is the most popular People cover girl (she's
appeared 50 times), or that the magazine's best seller (at 5.2
million copies) was devoted to Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine claims an audience of one in five American adults.
Its circulation is 3.6 million, but People says its ``pass-along''
numbers are high _ roughly 10 pairs of eyeballs on every copy sold,
or 36 million readers. (People sells 80,000 copies in metro
Atlanta.)
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's guiding logic revolves around understanding the
arc of a celebrity's ``hotness'' and by Stolley's laws, which
define a strict hierarchy of desirability. For a cover image, the
maxim goes, young is better than old, pretty is better than ugly,
rich is better than poor, and ``nothing,'' says Stolley, now a
senior editorial advisor, ``is better than the celebrity dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity grief, called OPP, or ``other people's problems'' at
story meetings, is also a mainstay. It allows readers to identify
with the personality, says managing editor Carol Wallace, and to
put their own problems in perspective. ``They think, `God, famous
people get sick, famous people have divorces, famous people get
married and have babies.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes People must profile an uncooperative subject _ called
a ``writearound'' _ as in the controversial Chelsea Clinton cover
story. But more often the star will participate. Michael J. Fox
approached the magazine when he wanted to tell the story of his
ordeal with Parkinson's disease, and People obtained exclusive
access to Barbra Streisand's 1998 wedding to James Brolin.
</P>
<P>
   The access might come with a price tag _ People had to pay
$175,000 to Elizabeth Taylor's favorite charity to shoot her
wedding to Larry Fortensky _ but the editors say they never pay for
stories or relinquish editorial control.
</P>
<P>
   Another mainstay is the ``real people'' story, such as the
account of a dad who hiked 48 miles through snow to save his
family, or the tot who survived devastating burns. People defines
its stories as ``ordinary people doing extraordinary things.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally all these elements come together, as when the
magazine sketched the tragedy of AIDS through the life of a little
boy named Ryan White. ``That put a human face to this story,'' says
People's president Nora McAniff.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not the magazine's coverage of the Oklahoma bombing
or the Hitler diaries that attracts so many readers (two-thirds of
whom are women), but such perennial creampuffs as its ``Sexiest Man
Alive'' and ``The 50 Most Beautiful People in the World'' issues.
Syracuse University professor of pop culture Robert Thompson calls
these bon-bons ``reading material for people who like to watch
television.''
</P>
<P>
   An airheaded reputation has dogged the magazine from the
beginning. People was a punchline in ``The Big Chill,'' when it
served as an emblem of empty fluff (''It's just good investigative
journalism'' deadpanned Jeff Goldblum, playing a People reporter.)
</P>
<P>
   But readers don't care. ``They can take shots at us, but in the
end I know, and 36 million readers know, that we produce quality
journalism,'' says Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   McAniff demonstrates her magazine's attraction by leaving a copy
in the waiting room when she visits advertisers. She guarantees
that the magazine will be gone when the meeting adjourns. It is.
``We are,'' she says, ``the most stolen magazine in America.''

BILLIONAIRE AGREES TO RETURN ANCIENT COINS TO TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Capitulating to claims that he was hoarding ancient
treasure, billionaire William I. Koch says he will deliver nearly
1,700 coins to the Republic of Turkey, settling a massive lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement came a full decade after the lawsuit was filed in
Boston federal court, and was somewhat unexpected: Koch, a
businessman and America's Cup winner with a history of waging
lengthy lawsuits, had insisted that the coins rightfully belonged
to him and his two partners _ and won support for his claim from a
former curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The Turkish
government, meanwhile, represented by New York attorney Lawrence M.
Kaye, had vowed not to relent until the entire hoard had been
returned.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's settlement was a clear indication of the strength
of the Turkish case, and signified a great victory for Turkish
officials, who have made a 10-year crusade out of retrieving lost
artifacts and works of art. Under the agreement, Turkey will get
the coins; Koch, in return, will have his name carved into a plaque
where the coins will be displayed in Turkey, with a statement that
reads: ``With special appreciation for the American businessman
William I. Koch.''
</P>
<P>
   The coins include Athenian decadrachmas some 2,000 years old,
according to the Turkish government, which are believed to be worth
several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The treasure _ variously described as the ``Elmali Hoard,''
after the region in southern Turkey where it was found, and the
``King Tut of numismatics discoveries'' by experts in the classics
world _ has been in dispute virtually ever since it was unearthed
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Three peasant farmers discovered the collection with nothing
more than a handheld metal detector, then cleaned the coins and
sold them to well-known coin smugglers in the Grand Bazaar in
Istanbul, according to Turkish officials. The peasants were caught
and prosecuted; the coins, meanwhile, made their way out of Turkey
and into foreign hands, in violation of Turkish law.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Turkish government began an international hunt in
pursuit of the collection, the coins were scattered around the
globe, with some landing as far away as Los Angeles, in the
possession of former LA Kings owner Bruce McNall. McNall later
returned his coins, when the Turkish government noisily protested.
But Koch and his partners, who had bought the vast majority of the
coins for approximately $3 million, did not.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Koch and his two partners, Jeffrey Spier and Jonathan
H. Kagan, refused to publicly acknowledge the coins had even come
from southern Turkey, and at no point during the dispute publicly
admitted they were in the wrong. In a statement provided for a
Globe article about the hoard last December, Koch insisted the
coins were not the same ones claimed by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the defendants' claims that the coins were not the
lost Turkish hoard was Cornelius C. Vermeule III, the curator of
the classical art department at the MFA for nearly 40 years before
retiring in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After learning from Kagan, a partner at the investment firm of
Lazard Freres, that he might be able to buy the coins, Koch turned
to the MFA to get them authenticated. Vermeule, an idiosyncratic
expert known for his sharp memory and his fluency in seven
languages, examined the hoard and encouraged Koch to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, however, Vermeuele received a letter from a
bank manager in Switzerland, warning him that Turkish officials
were searching for the illegally-smuggled hoard. But rather than
warn Koch against the purchase, Vermeule sent the billionaire a
letter advising just the opposite. Koch apparently did not hesitate
before buying the coins.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 years that followed, one problem arose after the next.
Several dealers became suspicious of the coins. Then two Turkish
journalists, Meylik Keylan and Ozgen Acar, wrote a story about the
hoard for Connoisseur Magazine, informing the art world that one of
the great coin discoveries of the world had been ferreted out of
its native land and hidden in an American businessman's vault.
Three years later, in 1989, Turkey filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Koch _ who last made headlines in Boston when he sued his
mistress, Catherine de Castelbajac, in housing court, for refusing
to leave his Four Seasons penthouse _ Thursday accepted an
invitation from the Turkish Ministry of Culture to travel to Turkey
for a ceremony returning the coins. In a statement, he neither
admitted guilt nor accepted the Turkish government's claim that the
coins originated in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Koch said: ``I want the Turkish people to enjoy these
coins for years to come.''

ARIZONA EXECUTES GERMAN MAN IN GAS CHAMBER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ A German citizen was executed in a gas chamber in
Arizona on Wednesday night, leading Germans Thursday to accuse the
United States of ``barbarism'' and of flouting international law.
</P>
<P>
   The inmate, Walter LaGrand, 37, was put to death in a cloud of
cyanide gas for his role in the 1982 murder of a bank manager.
</P>
<P>
   LaGrand's brother, Karl, 35, was executed last week in Arizona
for his role in the same crime.
</P>
<P>
   The LaGrands were convicted in 1982 of stabbing Walter Hartsock
to death in a botched bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Both brothers chose the gas chamber in the hope that courts
would find the method unconstitutional. But when this tactic
failed, Karl LaGrand accepted a last-minute offer of a lethal
injection on Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Walter LaGrand opted for the gas, with its resonance of the
Holocaust for Germans. That potent symbolism fueled the outcry
here, with members of Parliament calling for sanctions against the
United States and radio stations flooded with indignant calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is barbaric and unworthy of a state based on the rule of
law,'' Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin said.
</P>
<P>
   Walter and Karl LaGrand were born in Augsburg, Germany, but
moved to Arizona as infants after their mother married a U.S.
soldier she had met in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has no death penalty. Both Ms. Daeubler-Gmelin and
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer had appealed for clemency, saying
the LaGrands had been denied their rights as German citizens
because prosecutors did not inform the German consulate of the
brothers' arrest in 1982 until a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Dee Hull rejected the appeals, saying the LaGrands had
enjoyed the same rights any U.S. citizen would have had. Arizona
officials conceded, however, that the Vienna Convention, under
which the LaGrands should have been advised of their right to
consular assistance at their trial, had not been observed.

BANKBOSON FUND UNIT TO HEIGHTEN SUPERVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After an inquiry by state securities regulators,
BankBoston's mutual fund unit Thursday agreed to beef up
supervision of its sales force to prevent ``switching,'' the
practice of steering customers toward new investments to generate
fees and commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Without admitting any wrongdoing, BankBoston Investor Services
agreed to monitor all mutual fund transactions and hire an outside
auditor to review the bank's mutual fund activities for the next
two years, according to a pact with the Massachusetts Securities
Division.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement requires the bank to tell customers the reasons it
recommends switching from one mutual fund to another and warns them
that such a change could result in extra fees and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The bank must also set up an automated surveillance program that
produces daily lists of potential switch transactions and conduct
yearly seminars for members of its sales force, according to the
agreement. The bank also agreed to pay a $22,000 fine to cover the
cost of the securities division's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about enhancing consumer protection,'' said
Matthew Nestor, director of the securities division. ``It will make
sure customers are informed and make sure decisions are made for
sound investment reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston officials claimed the state's review failed to
uncover evidence of switching at the bank but it agreed to the
changes to ensure ``the protection of our customers,'' said bank
spokesman John Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no violations or complaints, and we already had
strong proceedures in place,'' he said. ``While there was an
inquiry, what we did was voluntarily enhnace some policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The division began its inquiry last August after receiving a tip
that the bank's sales staff may have inappropriately encouraged
customers to shift from no-load, or no-fee, mutual funds into
fee-bearing load funds and annuities.

TREASURY PRICES MOVE LITTLE AS INVESTORS AWAIT JOBS DATA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury securities changed little Thursday, as
anxious investors awaited the Friday release of the government's
monthly jobs data.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond slipped 2/32,
to 93 21/32. Its yield was unchanged at 5.69 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One manager said market participants feared that a number above
250,000 new jobs could scare away many investors and cause the
yield on the long bond to rise to last summer's levels, heightening
speculation that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates
later this year to combat inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But things could go the other way if Friday's number shows that
fewer jobs were added to the economy in February, setting the stage
for a rally in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   A surge in the economy during the first two months of the year
has caused credit markets to reassess future monetary policy. And a
diminishing flow of flight-to-quality buying has reversed some of
the premium priced into bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Though economic fundamentals appear to have turned against
bonds, higher rates have also attracted some investors away from
equity markets in favor of bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Donne, vice president and senior portfolio manager at
Banc One Investment Advisors Corp. in Columbus, Ohio, said, ``The
fear in the market is really being driven by the seemingly
ever-declining weekly initial unemployment claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, according to the Labor Department, initial claims for
state jobless benefits fell by 8,000 in the week ending last
Saturday to a seasonally adjusted 286,000. The four-week average of
290,750 is the lowest average in a decade. It was 287,500 on Feb.
24, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Donne said the consensus for Friday's number was about 245,000
jobs created in February, with a range from 200,000 to 300,000. If
Friday's number is under 250,000, he said, the long bond could
rally down to a yield of 5.60 percent, but would have trouble
declining further without more encouraging news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comments by the Fed chairman recently have pretty much
indicated that the central bank is not worried about the liquidity
problem of last fall that was caused by the hedge fund debacles
when overseas markets fumbled,'' Donne said. ``But what they are
worried about is an overheated economy and high stock market
evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   How much the Fed might do at this month's Federal Open Market
Committee meeting on March 30 has already been priced into the
market, Donne said. ``The answer is quite a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some market participants like Donne say that rates at these
levels are high enough to slow the economy.  &QL;

CLARINET PLAYERS SOUGHT FOR RESEARCH ON PERFORMANCE PAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLOTTE HUFF 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all starts with the thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Years of devotion to the clarinet can weigh heavily on the
digit, sometimes triggering pain up through the wrist and hand to
the shoulder and neck.
</P>
<P>
   North Texas researchers are searching for 60 clarinetists to
help study better playing techniques for fiercely competitive
musicians who are often slow to help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years in the music business, if you showed a sign of
weakness, it meant you were on the way out,'' said John Scott, a
clarinet professor in the College of Music at the University of
North Texas in Denton.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the first by researchers at the Texas Center for
Music &AMP; Medicine to look at the mechanics of instrument playing.
The center was jointly launched last year by UNT and the University
of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   In a world filled with sports medicine information, too little
is understood about how or when musicians suffer
performance-related muscle and nerve damage, said Kris Chesky,
research assistant professor in UNT's College of Music. The
clarinet, Chesky said, presented a good starting point, because
most of the instrument's weight falls in one place.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the problem, said Dr. Bernard Rubin, chief of
rheumatology at UNT Health Science Center, who co-directs the
center with Chesky.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a tendinitis at the wrist or at the forearm, similar
to what you see with tennis players, with the force that they have
to grip the racket,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The thumb, he added, is not just called upon to support the
instrument, but also to push it toward the mouth, creating a seal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your thumb gets tired,'' Rubin said, ``you must grip the
mouth tighter to get that seal, so then people complain of jaw and
neck problems.''
</P>
<P>
   If they complain at all.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, faced with pain in his left arm five years ago, sought
help only when it became so fierce that he had difficulty gripping
a toothbrush or writing more than a few sentences. For the first
time in his 40-something years, Scott started stretching before he
lifted the instrument and wore an arm brace, both of which he
credits with providing some relief.
</P>
<P>
   Did he continue to play?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Next on the center's program: research into the drum and the
trumpet.

ADMINISTRATION NAMES PROFESSOR CHIEF COUNSELOR OF PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has appointed an
opinionated law professor from Ohio State University as the
government's new chief counselor of privacy, just as the United
States and Europe try to resolve a serious disagreement over
privacy regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Peter P. Swire, a specialist in privacy law, will start work in
the Office of Management and Budget next week with the mission of
coordinating administration privacy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said Thursday that he welcomed the
appointment, adding that Swire ``will provide expertise on privacy
issues, helping to find an appropriate balance between individual
privacy rights and the legitimate use of personal information by
government and the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gore promised to appoint a privacy `czar' in response
to complaints that the administration's privacy initiatives were
uncoordinated. Now, however, a Commerce Department official, not
Swire, will mediate the dispute between Europe and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   And the Federal Trade Commission, another important source of
privacy regulation and enforcement, operates largely independent of
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute with the European Union involves Europe's law, which
took effect at the end of October, prohibiting the transfer of
personal information to countries that do not have adequate rules
to protect it. EU officials have made it clear that they do not
regard this country's privacy protections to be adequate, and the
Clinton administration is in negotiations with the EU to avert
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Swire, along with Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution,
published a book on the subject last fall entitled: ``None of Your
Business: World Data Flows, Electronic Commerce, and the European
Privacy Directive.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, he wrote: ``Unlike the nations of Western Europe, the
United States does not have a single, comprehensive privacy law.
Nor does it have an agency charged with administering privacy law.
The United States approach to date has been more selective,
regulating the private sector fairly strictly in certain areas, but
not legislating for a wide range of uses.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said Swire's job will be to work with
the several federal agencies that have responsibilities in this
area to make sure the government's approach is coordinated, but he
will not set policy.
</P>
<P>
   Swire said the OMB had asked him not to accept interviews. But
Litan, who wrote the book on privacy with Swire, said, ``I think
Peter will be very successful. He has a tremendous facility for
getting people from different backgrounds to work together. And
he's extremely knowledgeable about privacy and the EU directive.''

 &HT;    Burned churches cope with fraud surrounding aid
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel and Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLIGEE, Ala. _ After three black baptist churches burned here
within three weeks of each other starting around Christmas 1995,
money for rebuilding poured in. Nearly $300,000 in donations flowed
into a town with less than 1,000 people, a general store and a post
office that closes for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Like dozens of rural outposts in the South, Boligee welcomed the
bounty that came as part of a national response to the rash of
church fires that occurred during the next two years. The National
Council of Churches in New York distributed many of the private
donations, awarding $6.6 million nationwide since 1996. The NCC has
given 149 grants in 32 states _ including $220,000 in Boligee.
</P>
<P>
   Southern churches have received three-quarters of the grants.
Nationally, 78 churches rebuilt or bought new buildings, and
another 71 are building or planning.
</P>
<P>
   But the money managed by the NCC was only a fraction of the
donations and insurance settlements spent since church fires caught
the attention of President Clinton in 1996, and a smattering of
fraud has seeped through.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the president of one of the country's largest black
religious organizations was convicted in Florida for grand theft of
donations intended to rebuild churches. A jury ruled that the Rev.
Henry Lyons, head of the National Baptist Convention, took $244,500
in donations from the Anti-Defamation League and put $60,000 of it
into a personal savings account and gave $12,000 to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors presented evidence that Lyons wrote the ADL,
claiming he had given $70,000 to Boligee churches. Pastors,
however, testified receiving only one-third that amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a lot of money flowing, particularly a lot of
money in a small community, it upsets the balance,'' said Betsey
Miller, head of the Church Rebuilding Project for the National
Council of Churches. While he was mayor of Boligee, A.L. ``Buddy''
Lavendar said personal contributions began flowing to him ranging
from $5 in cash to a $5,000 check. The 71-year-old ended up
collecting $40,000 _ nearly three times the Greene County annual
median household income of $14,300. He established a local
rebuilding fund controlled by Boligee's three burned churches and
himself. The Mount Zion, Little Zion and Mount Zora churches all
have been rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Since accepting donations, Lavendar has been accused by the
local newspaper of spending some of the money on a personal
vacation, been the subject of an investigation urged by local
pastors, lost re-election and filed a $6 million libel suit,
claiming the published allegations are untrue. Later, a former
Mount Zion deacon was indicted on charges he stole $10,500 in
donations.
</P>
<P>
   There were other contributions solicited by local and national
organizations that never made it to Boligee, Lavendar claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got stopped on the way _ and that's above what I got and
what Lyons got,'' Lavendar said.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, though, donations have been a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount Olive Full Gospel Church in south Fulton County, Ga.,
burned in 1994 and relied on $100,000 in donations to rebuild _
including $34,500 from the NCC. Pastor Horace Lewis said he spent
months writing for help. Lyons' deception diverted funds he could
have used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that shines is not gold,'' Lewis said. ``This was
an opportunity for people to go out and do things like that, go out
and take advantage of the churches and fires.''
</P>
<P>
   During reconstruction, Lewis sent building proposals and
schedules to the NCC. Volunteers rebuilt the sanctuary on eight
consecutive Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   The fire at Lewis' church and the three in Boligee are among 427
pending investigations _ two-thirds of the 670 cases covered by the
National Church Arson Task Force from January 1995 to the present.
The task force opened 89 investigations in 1997, and 55 through
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said the arrest last month of Scott Ballinger
in Indiana may account for up to 50 fires in the South and Midwest.
Still, that would leave hundreds of cases unsolved. The task force
has concluded there is no evidence of a national conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never claimed there was a national conspiracy,'' said Ken
Jacobson, assistant director for the Anti-Defamation League. ``One
doesn't have to conclude there's a conspiracy to conclude there's a
serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Clinton pledged government-backing for up to $10
million in loans for burned churches. Of an estimated 200 churches
eligible, only 12 have applied.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has
approved eight loan requests totaling $2 million, said deputy
director Tony Johnston. The agency is processing another two
requests, he said. It turned down two others because, in one case,
the fire was ruled accidental. In the other, the church's
documentation was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   If a church defaults on a HUD-approved loan, the government
repays the lender. In exchange for the guarantee, banks lend money
at below-market interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the flow of loans has been slow.
</P>
<P>
   HUD is preparing to offer greater technical assistance to
churches in preparing loan applications that will satisfy banks and
the federal agency's strict requirements, Johnston said.

 &HT;    Neo-Nazis next target of lawyer who broke Klan
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANNING, S.C. _ An hour past midnight, pastor Jonathan Mouzon
sped toward his country church as fast as his Chevy Lumina could
carry him. A section of sky glowed the orange of a fireball. Two
days earlier, the Ku Klux Klan had nailed a flier to the door of
Macedonia Baptist Church. A skull and crossbones on the white paper
illustrated an ominous warning: ``KKK _ is watching you.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would torch a house of God, not even the Klan, Mouzon
thought. By the time he pulled up, what looked like a tornado of
fire swirled from the middle of the church roof. Before sunrise,
Macedonia's ashes joined the heap of more than 120 African-American
church fires investigated in the South since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   An uneasiness prevailed. ``You were constantly looking over your
shoulder,'' said Mouzon, a shift supervisor for a security company.
</P>
<P>
   So when a white lawyer from Alabama called offering to sue the
Klan and win justice, some in the Macedonia flock were skeptical.
Doubters figured Morris Dees was out to make a buck on their
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Since co-founding the Southern Poverty Law Center in 1971, Dees
has wielded the civil lawsuit like a buck knife, carving financial
assets out of hate group leaders who inspire followers to beat,
burn and kill. He is convinced the best weapons to combat organized
hate are a finely honed legal complaint and a fully loaded bank
account. Now in his legal firing line sits the Aryan Nations, a
white supremacist group in Idaho. On Jan. 25, the Montgomery,
Ala.-based law center filed a lawsuit on behalf of a mother and son
who allege they were assaulted and terrorized by its neo-Nazi
members. The goal is the same legal tactic that worked against the
Klan: seizing the compound and other assets of leader Richard
Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Dees had something similar in mind for the Christian Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan, a group he said recruited throughout the
Carolinas. Eventually, leaders of the Christian Knights were
convicted of civil conspiracy _ inciting the fire that destroyed
Macedonia Baptist Church on June 21, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   By the next summer, Macedonia stood again. Tucked away in one of
South Carolina's poorest counties, the church took out a $100,000
loan, built a single-story brick sanctuary and went into debt for
the first time in Mouzon's 13 years as pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Dees said he could win a multimillion-dollar civil judgment that
would put the South Carolina Klan out of business. Dees explained
how he had won money damages against the Klan before _ one for $7
million in Mobile, Ala., another for $1 million in Forsyth County,
Ga. He told how he had protected Vietnamese fishermen in Texas from
Klan intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not this enormous person that you read about. He was
one of you,'' Mouzon said recently in the rebuilt church, its
floors covered by carpet as red as Santa's suit.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia signed on. As he does in all his cases, Dees charged
the church nothing. Last summer, his litigators and investigators
secured a $37.8 million judgment against the Christian Knights of
Ku Klux Klan. Even after a court reduced the damages to $20
million, it remains the largest punitive damage ever imposed
against a hate group.
</P>
<P>
   The law center estimates it collects less than 2 cents on the
dollar for every successful civil judgment. All money realized from
settlements is given to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   What the lawsuits have done, even some Klan leaders have
conceded, is make extremist activity a bad investment, diminishing
the will of financial backers of alleged hate groups. In most of
the cases pursued by Dees, the defendants also have lost what
little property they held.
</P>
<P>
   SWAYED BY RECORD
</P>
<P>
   To persuade Macedonia Baptist elders, Dees told them about
Beulah Mae Donald, the elderly mother of 19-year-old Michael
Donald, who was hanged from a tree in downtown Mobile in 1981. Then
64, the cleaning woman agreed to bring suit against the United
Klans of America.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted neither vengeance nor money. She wanted justice for
Michael. Dees sought to destroy the corporate Klan. Bank records
showed the UKA had several thousand dues-paying members in 30
states. Depositions and record searches unveiled corporate fronts
designed to hide Klan ownership of a building used as headquarters
in Tuscaloosa. Former Klan members testified that UKA President
Robert Shelton had encouraged violence against blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy trial lasted four days. An all-white jury of six
found United Klans of America liable and ordered it to pay $7
million to Beulah Mae Donald. The UKA as a machine of hatred had
been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Klan of yesteryear is dead,'' Shelton said in a 1995
interview. ``Society's changing. You can't have parades with
Klansmen in robes anymore. ... The public won't go along with it.
The Klan is gone. It will never return.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald received the deed to the Klan faction's $125,000
Tuscaloosa headquarters _ the closest she ever got to the $7
million awarded by the jury. She sold the property for half its
appraised value and bought her first house. Donald died in 1988, a
year after the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ASSETS UNDER ATTACK
</P>
<P>
   Using civil suits, the Southern Poverty Law Center seizes
whatever assets the targeted hate group owns _ although it never
amounts to the millions of dollars that ring up headlines. In
military terms, Dees goes after command and control centers.
</P>
<P>
   Mouzon's church eventually may get only $200,000, if that, the
law center said, from the Christian Knights and Horace King, the
South Carolina grand dragon found guilty of inciting the burning of
the Macedonia Baptist Church. That's only a penny on the dollar.
But it will put King on the street and, theoretically, the Klan out
of business. Hate groups are paying attention to Dees' tactics. One
white supremacist group, fearful of being sued by Dees, transferred
its assets to another organization. A federal court ruled in 1996
against the attempted evasion, and the law center now is trying to
collect an $85,000 judgment.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 edition of the ``Florida InterKlan Report,'' a
publication ``serving the Florida Klan cartel,'' focused on Dees'
efforts in Manning. The advice: disband immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Klan will always be around under one name or another,''
the newsletter said. ``Don't appeal for defense funds. Close your
bank accounts. Forget about lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   A CRUCIAL LINK
</P>
<P>
   But proving organized hate isn't as easy as showing pictures of
flaming crosses to a jury. Newsletters, and Web sites stewing in
fiery rhetoric aren't enough for conviction. The convincing tie-in
comes when a former member of the group testifies against the Klan,
linking rhetoric to violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of King, the South Carolina grand dragon, the law
center found in its database a video of him at a Klan march in
Washington. In the tape, shown to jurors, King talks about blacks
and yells, ``If we had this garbage in South Carolina, we would
burn the bastards out!''
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Klansmen testified that King encouraged them to
burn black churches. King postponed one church fire, fearing the
Klan would be suspected.
</P>
<P>
   King's attorney, Gary White of Columbia, S.C., relied on a First
Amendment defense: Derogatory remarks about blacks are protected
free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not an easy pitch to a jury,'' White said. ``It was
ugly and inflammatory, but that's what the First Amendment is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   White dismissed the notion that the judgment had a financial
impact on the Christian Knights since King owns only ``a couple of
acres and a small, run-down house on it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Richard Cohen, legal director of the Southern Poverty
Law Center, argues that huge damage awards ripple down to Klan foot
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he is likely to lose his home is probably not
the kind of thing he would just shrug off,'' Cohen said. ``That's
the kind of thing that has a lasting impact. When you're going off
to the Klan rally and you're saying goodbye to your wife, she's not
real happy about the prospect that if you get involved with these
people you may lose your home.''
</P>
<P>
   Tactics questioned
</P>
<P>
   Collecting evidence that will convince juries of clear-cut
conspiracies costs a bundle. Dees estimates the Manning
investigation cost nearly $100,000 _ $500,000 if attorney time had
been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the law center devotes so much to fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1997, it raised $102 million, according to its
federal tax filings. Seventy-four cents of every dollar raised came
from more than 300,000 private contributors. During the same time,
the group spent $15 million on fund-raising _ more than 22 cents of
every dollar consumed by total expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the law center started with an endowment of $72,775.
Its goal was to raise enough money to permanently fund its mission
of helping minorities litigate against civil rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the endowment topped $90 million _ $89.6 million of it
invested in equity securities. The organization's net assets
exceeded $97 million.
</P>
<P>
   Located in the same block as Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, which
was once pastored by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the law
center will begin construction next month of a $10 million,
six-story expansion across the street from its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Dees drew a $205,339 salary in 1996 as the center's chief trial
counsel and chairman of its executive committee. He contributed
$19,458 to the employee benefit plan, according to the center's
1996 federal tax form.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Turnipseed, a Columbia lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for
South Carolina attorney general last November, helped Dees get in
touch with Macedonia Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morris loves to raise money,'' said Turnipseed, a distant
relative of Dees'. ``Some of his gimmicks are just so transparent _
but they're good. He knows how to get people to give him the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent fund-raising letter, Turnipseed said, his return
envelope came with ``about six different stamps. It was like they
had to cobble them all together to come up with 35 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller civil rights groups, like the Center for Democratic
Renewal in Atlanta, which started as the Anti-Klan Network, wonder
why the law center needs so much money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears they're just sitting on it. The community doesn't
see the product,'' said Chris Freeman, a Center for Democratic
Renewal researcher who relies on statistics from the Montgomery
group. ``But the question is: Where are the funds going? Their
research is geared to groups like us, but there's nothing in the
com- munity.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism turns to vitriol among hate leaders, who lob their
bombast in newsletters and on the Internet. Tom Metzger, head of
the White Aryan Resistance, lost a $12.5 million suit in 1990 to
Dees for inspiring the beating death of an Ethiopian immigrant. He
pays $845 a month to the victim's estate. Less than affectionately,
Metzger calls his nemesis ``Morris Sleaze.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleazy must be given credit where credit is due,'' Metzger
once wrote. ``He has compiled the largest direct mail financial
sucker list in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The core of the law center's program is ``Teaching Tolerance,''
a classroom program started in 1991. A magazine that promotes
``interracial and intercultural understanding'' goes to more than
400,000 teachers. The program features books, videos and posters
costing up to $30 each.
</P>
<P>
   The law center also funds a three-year, $100,000 civil rights
litigation program in Georgia. The program is designed to stem
federal cutbacks in programs that had provided free legal
assistance to poor people in civil actions.
</P>
<P>
   Mouzon, the Macedonia pastor, said he doesn't begrudge the law
center one cent. ``Not at all,'' he said, ``because we know
firsthand what they do. He knew we didn't have any money to accept
representation.''
</P>
<P>
   THEY TEND TO RUN
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon sun pours a honey-colored glow into Young's
Country Mart near Manning, pallet makers from a nearby mill buy
quart bottles of Colt 45 malt liquor at the counter. ``Maybe a few
of them graduated from high school,'' said Jesse Young, a trustee
at Macedonia Baptist and a former deputy sheriff who runs the
convenience store. One of the regulars is Romeo Haley. His brother
is Arthur, a Klansman who testified against the real big shots _
Horace King and Virgil Griffin, the main defendants in the
Macedonia fire.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping in to buy gas and chicken tenders, Romeo Haley says
race relations have stayed the same since the lawsuit. ``I don't
think it's changed except that people have hid themselves and run.
Everybody that was in the Klan has run from the Klan.'' Haley said
he ``never had no use'' for the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just poor rednecks looking for some kind of cause,''
he said. ``They're fed up with the federal government, but they'll
get scared and run in a minute. There are people who planted the
tree and fertilized the tree but when it bore fruit, they ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the civil verdict, a healing spirit has touched Macedonia.
Mouzon plans a church picnic for his country community. Timothy
Welch, one of those convicted for setting the blaze, grew up in the
area, climbing a pecan tree just outside the church and playing
with church members' kids.
</P>
<P>
   Mouzon sent him a letter saying no one in the church had grown
to hate him. Welch's mother, Wanda, has attended recent Sunday
services. Each time, she apologized to the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no need, Mouzon said. All is forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to move past it,'' he said. ``It comes up
occasionally. But we're trying to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   FINANCING LAWSUITS FOR THE POOR
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center has accumulated enough wealth in
recent years to embark on a major construction project and to have
assets totaling around $100 million. But the civil rights
organization still spends most of its money on programs to help
poor people. (Figures below are in millions).

DELAY `CLEARS THE AIR' IN ASSERTING CHARGES, RUMORS ARE FALSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Majority Whip Tom DeLay vigorously defended
himself Thursday against published reports that he may have lied
under oath and against rumors that he had an extramarital affair
that produced an illegitimate child.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last four months I have been accused of perjury,
accepting illegal honoraria and being the biological father of my
foster children, '' DeLay said in a statement, asserting that all
of the charges are false.
</P>
<P>
   The public defense followed a private meeting Wednesday with a
group of his deputy whips, where the Houston-area Republican said
the reports and rumors were part of a conspiracy by the White House
and Democratic lawmakers to ruin his reputation because of his
forceful advocacy of President Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A close aide to the Texan said DeLay wanted to ``clear the air''
by answering any questions his colleagues had about stories
regarding his conduct in a lawsuit five years ago. He also has been
dogged by rumors, largely unpublished but making the rounds on
Capitol Hill, that he had an affair while in the Texas Legislature
more than 15 years ago that produced a child, whom he later took
into his home under a foster care program.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, DeLay expressed outrage at the rumors. He
called them ``the most despicable charge of all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My response is that I am the proud foster parent of two
children and I will continue to be regardless of how my political
enemies try to exploit my foster children for political gain,''
DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a cleansing thing for Tom,'' the aide said of his
meeting with colleagues. DeLay decided to respond to the
allegations partly because ``some members were getting questioned
about them'' by reporters and constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were being asked questions they couldn't answer,'' the
aide said, ``and Tom wanted to let them know that none of this is
true.''
</P>
<P>
   The charge that he may have lied under oath in a lawsuit brought
by a former business partner five years ago stemmed from published
reports a month ago. But rumors about an extramarital affair that
produced a child have not been widely reported, except in a New
York Post gossip column last month that was later picked up by a
political newsletter. A Capitol Hill newspaper printed but then
retracted a story that DeLay had accepted more honoraria than
allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
   Although DeLay and his aides have charged that the accusations
were being circulated by Democrats out to get him, elements of them
were floated as long ago as two years by Texas Republicans, some of
whom have counted themselves among his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Chronicle reported in January that DeLay, facing a
lawsuit brought by a former partner in Albo Pest Control Inc.,
denied under oath in a February 1994 deposition that he was an
officer or director of the company and then backtracked to say he
couldn't recall what position he held.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the deposition and afterward, however, DeLay filed
financial disclosure forms with Congress listing himself as
chairman of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute with former business partner Robert Blankenship was
settled out of court in January, 1995. But Blankenship and his
Houston attorney, Gerald De Nisco, said they were unaware of the
congressional filings at the time or they would have raised them as
an issue with the court.
</P>
<P>
   De Nisco told the Chronicle that DeLay, in his view, either lied
in the deposition about being an officer or director in the company
to avoid any financial liability, or lied on his financial
disclosure reports.
</P>
<P>
   In his whip meeting Wednesday, DeLay offered what his aides
described as a ``clarifying document'' that he said was sent to the
court five months after the deposition. One of his aides said it
was designed to correct any ``misimpressions'' that may have been
left by his deposition.
</P>
<P>
   But the document filed in July 1994 was an amended pleading and
counterclaim filed in response to the Blankenship lawsuit, and it
did not specifically address the deposition DeLay gave five months
earlier. It did, however, make clear that DeLay was indeed both a
director and officer in the company.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said in his statement Thursday that he couldn't remember
``my formal role in the company'' at the time of the deposition,
which is why he later filed ``a formal pleading to the court
clarifying any confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that this was never an issue in the case. It was
never an issue at the time of the deposition,'' he said, suggesting
that his political opponents raised it only after he began
demanding that Clinton be impeached for lying under oath in the
Monica Lewinsky matter. DeLay continued to insist that he did not
commit perjury ``or pull a Clinton under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, De Nisco said Thursday that the amended pleading
filed by DeLay after the deposition ``still doesn't mitigate the
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of taking the deposition, the guy perjured
himself. There is no doubt in my mind that the guy looked me in the
eye and perjured himself,'' De Nisco said. &QL;

BILLIONAIRE AGREES TO RETURN ANCIENT COINS TO TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>

 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Capitulating to claims that he was hoarding ancient
treasure, billionaire William I. Koch says he will deliver nearly
1,700 coins to the Republic of Turkey, settling a massive lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement came a full decade after the lawsuit was filed in
Boston federal court, and was somewhat unexpected: Koch, a
businessman and America's Cup winner with a history of waging
lengthy lawsuits, had insisted that the coins rightfully belonged
to him and his two partners _ and won support for his claim from a
former curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The Turkish
government, meanwhile, represented by New York attorney Lawrence M.
Kaye, had vowed not to relent until the entire hoard had been
returned.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's settlement was a clear indication of the strength
of the Turkish case, and signified a great victory for Turkish
officials, who have made a 10-year crusade out of retrieving lost
artifacts and works of art. Under the agreement, Turkey will get
the coins; Koch, in return, will have his name carved into a plaque
where the coins will be displayed in Turkey, with a statement that
reads: ``With special appreciation for the American businessman
William I. Koch.''
</P>
<P>
   The coins include Athenian decadrachmas some 2,000 years old,
according to the Turkish government, which are believed to be worth
several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The treasure _ variously described as the ``Elmali Hoard,''
after the region in southern Turkey where it was found, and the
``King Tut of numismatics discoveries'' by experts in the classics
world _ has been in dispute virtually ever since it was unearthed
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Three peasant farmers discovered the collection with nothing
more than a handheld metal detector, then cleaned the coins and
sold them to well-known coin smugglers in the Grand Bazaar in
Istanbul, according to Turkish officials. The peasants were caught
and prosecuted; the coins, meanwhile, made their way out of Turkey
and into foreign hands, in violation of Turkish law.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Turkish government began an international hunt in
pursuit of the collection, the coins were scattered around the
globe, with some landing as far away as Los Angeles, in the
possession of former LA Kings owner Bruce McNall. McNall later
returned his coins, when the Turkish government noisily protested.
But Koch and his partners, who had bought the vast majority of the
coins for approximately $3 million, did not.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Koch and his two partners, Jeffrey Spier and Jonathan
H. Kagan, refused to publicly acknowledge the coins had even come
from southern Turkey, and at no point during the dispute publicly
admitted they were in the wrong. In a statement provided for a
Globe article about the hoard last December, Koch insisted the
coins were not the same ones claimed by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the defendants' claims that the coins were not the
lost Turkish hoard was Cornelius C. Vermeule III, the curator of
the classical art department at the MFA for nearly 40 years before
retiring in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After learning from Kagan, a partner at the investment firm of
Lazard Freres, that he might be able to buy the coins, Koch turned
to the MFA to get them authenticated. Vermeule, an idiosyncratic
expert known for his sharp memory and his fluency in seven
languages, examined the hoard and encouraged Koch to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, however, Vermeuele received a letter from a
bank manager in Switzerland, warning him that Turkish officials
were searching for the illegally-smuggled hoard. But rather than
warn Koch against the purchase, Vermeule sent the billionaire a
letter advising just the opposite. Koch apparently did not hesitate
before buying the coins.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 years that followed, one problem arose after the next.
Several dealers became suspicious of the coins. Then two Turkish
journalists, Meylik Keylan and Ozgen Acar, wrote a story about the
hoard for Connoisseur Magazine, informing the art world that one of
the great coin discoveries of the world had been ferreted out of
its native land and hidden in an American businessman's vault.
Three years later, in 1989, Turkey filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Koch _ who last made headlines in Boston when he sued his
mistress, Catherine de Castelbajac, in housing court, for refusing
to leave his Four Seasons penthouse _ Thursday accepted an
invitation from the Turkish Ministry of Culture to travel to Turkey
for a ceremony returning the coins. In a statement, he neither
admitted guilt nor accepted the Turkish government's claim that the
coins originated in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Koch said: ``I want the Turkish people to enjoy these
coins for years to come.''

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Marc Ecrepont does not care about bananas.
But on Thursday he became a pawn in a trade war over them between
the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Ecrepont, general manager Groupe Fremaux SA in Lille, France,
exports bedsheets and other linens to the United States. As of
Thursday, the United States is imposing a 100 percent tariff on
those sheets after it failed to settle a long-running dispute over
European import rules for bananas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anything to do with bananas, except perhaps to
print them on our sheets,'' Ecremont said. ``I am in the middle of
a war, and I don't even know what they are fighting about. What can
I do? Go to church and light a candle?''
</P>
<P>
   Fremaux was one of scores of companies that are caught in a
bitter trade battle in which they have no stake and over which they
have no control.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Clinton administration imposed punitive 100
percent tariffs on about $520 million worth of European exports to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The tariffs followed months of bitter feuding over Europe's
import preferences for bananas from its former colonies. Neither
side produces bananas itself, but both have companies that market
them, and both have elevated the issue to one of righteous
indignation.
</P>
<P>
   As trade wars go, this one may rank as one of the most
confusing. The hit list includes 15 finely sliced categories, none
of which have anything to do with bananas. It includes cashmere
sweaters, but not cashmere jackets; bath preparations, but not bath
salts; printed bedsheets, but not embroidered ones.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say there was a method to the madness in
composing the list, which they announced in December, as the banana
brawl was heating up. The Americans wanted to come up with a volume
of exports roughly equal to the lost banana trade, and they wanted
to spread the pain to maximize the political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   They also excluded products exported by Denmark and the
Netherlands, which agreed with the United States on the banana
issue. Last but not least, they did not want to target exports that
would hurt U.S. companies. They dropped washing machines at the
last minute, because European machines use many U.S. components.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials argue this retaliation is
justified because Europe has refused to abandon its banana
preferences, even though they were declared illegal last year by
the Geneva-based World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But European business executives and government officials
angrily denounced the United States on Thursday, calling its action
arbitrary, unjustified and illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Brittan, the European Union's minister of trade, called the
tariffs ``unacceptable and unlawful'' and accused the United States
of endangering the jobs of ``people who have nothing whatsoever to
do with bananas.'' Trade ministers from Britain, France and Italy
all condemned the action in similar terms.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact was far more tangible and unnerving at the street
level, at scores of small companies that woke up Thursday morning
to find their businesses in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was the shock greater than in the border region between
Scotland and England, where Scottish companies make about half of
all the cashmere sweaters that go from Europe to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this goes through and it's long term, we'll go bankrupt,''
said Jeff Guttridge, financial director of Clan Douglas Ltd. in
Hawick, Scotland. Clan Douglas, which employs about 120 workers,
ships about $8 million worth of cashmere sweaters a year to
American stores like Nordstrom's, Neiman-Marcus and
Bergdorf-Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Many stores have already placed orders for the fall, and Clan
Douglas has guaranteed prices based on the normal tariff of 6.5
percent. With a 100 percent tariff, the company will have to pay
the difference itself. And U.S. merchants who have not yet placed
their orders for the fall will almost certainly decide against
cashmere this year because they would have to pay the tariff.
</P>
<P>
   It is more than just a blow to Clan Douglas. The villages in
Scotland's border region include a number of small companies that
make cashmere. About 15,000 people live in Hawick itself, and about
3,000 of them work in the cashmere industry.
</P>
<P>
   People like Guttridge say they are as baffled as they are
alarmed by the U.S. position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question we're asking is, Why cashmere?'' Guttridge said.
``Why is cashmere on this list? You can't see any logical
relationship with bananas.'' British government leaders were so
angry that the trade minister, Stephen Byer, summoned the American
ambassador in London, Philip Lader, to register a formal protest.
</P>
<P>
   But several business executives said their own governments had
not paid them much heed either, at least until Thursday. Because
the tariffs affect small slices of industry, such as candles or
bath preparations or one particular type of pecorino cheese,
companies that make those products said they had found it hard to
attract any attention in the broader banana battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I complain to the French government, nobody is going to
care about it because we are too small,'' Ecrepont said. ``I am all
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still possible that no one will have to pay the tariffs.
Two separate panels at the World Trade Organization are still
weighing several key issues and will be making additional rulings
in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said they will not actually collect the
tariffs until one of those panels rules on precisely how much
compensation the United States is entitled to over the banana
issue. The Geneva-based panel was supposed to decide that on March
2 but said it needed more information from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   For companies now trapped in the fight, that is cold comfort.
For one thing, U.S. officials are demanding that importers put up
bonds guaranteeing they will pay the tariffs if they are ultimately
collected. In addition, the mere threat of a 100-percent surcharge
is enough to kill off most orders.

</P>
<P>
   Many exporters scrambled on Thursday just to figure out if their
products were on the list.
</P>
<P>
   The action could spell trouble for two of Europe's best-known
luxury names: Gucci of Italy and Louis Vuitton of France. Both
would be hit by tariffs on leather handbags. As it happens, Gucci
is fighting a possible takeover attempt from Louis Vuitton's
parent, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. Neither company would
comment on the banana issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the Italian region of Sardinia, there was much confusion over
the matter of pecorino cheese, produced from sheep's milk.
</P>
<P>
   Did the tariffs apply to hard pecorino, exported in large
quantities, or did it apply only to the soft fresh variety sold
primarily in Europe? After some initial alarm, Italian business
executives tentatively concluded that only the fresh variety is
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   They still were not happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been the hard cheese, we would have been totally
ruined,'' said Nino Mura, chief executive of Sarda Formaggi in
Olbia, Sardinia.
</P>
<P>
   Many affected exporters are angry that the United States has
singled them out for punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happened to the special relationship between the U.S.
and the U.K that everybody talked about?'' Guttridge asked. ``After
all, we supported the United States in the Gulf, did not we?''
</P>
<P>
   In France, Ecrepont is glumly waiting for the great powers to
make up their minds. ``All I know is that as of today, I hate
everything that has anything to do with bananas,'' he said.

SUSPECTS CONFESS TO KILLING MAN WHO THEY SAY MADE HOMOSEXUAL
ADVANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two Alabama men told the authorities this week that
they beat a man to death with an ax handle last month and then
burned his body because the victim had previously made a homosexual
advance to them.
</P>
<P>
   Al Bradley, a sheriff's deputy in Coosa County, Ala., a rural
area between Birmingham and Montgomery, said Thursday that the two
men had confessed this week, after waiving their right to counsel,
and were then charged with the Feb. 19 murder of Billy Jack
Gaither, a 39-year-old textile worker.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, both of whom are being held in the Coosa County
jail in lieu of $500,000 bond, are Steven Eric Mullins, 25, and
Charles Monroe Butler Jr., 21. Both are construction workers from
Sylacauga, Ala., Bradley said. Butler confessed on Monday and
Mullins on Wednesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Steven Mullins, the Butler boy and the Gaither man were
acquaintances,'' Bradley said in a telephone interview. ``How long
they've known each other is not determined. But we do know they had
known each other at least two weeks, because that's when Mullins
said Gaither approached them in a sexual manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing took place at the time,'' he continued, ``but Mullins
states in his confession that that made him upset, that he didn't
like it because Gaither was gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that Mullins called Gaither at home on the night of
the killing and that Gaither then drove to pick up Mullins and
Butler at their homes. They drove to a reservoir outside of
Sylacauga, where the two suspects beat Gaither and placed him in
the trunk of his car. They then drove the car to Mullins' house,
picked up some kerosene, matches and two old tires, and drove to an
isolated area known as Peckerwood Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy said the suspects lighted the tires with the
kerosene, removed Gaither from the trunk, beat him in the head with
an ax handle and then placed his body on the burning tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``He died of severe blunt head trauma,'' Bradley said. ``Once
they saw that the body was going to burn they drove Gaither's car
to a landfill in Sylacauga and burned it up.'' Gaither's remains
were found the next day by a passerby.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that Butler emerged as a suspect after he told a
friend about the crime and said he was having trouble sleeping. The
friend tipped off the authorities, who then arrested the two
suspects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of gay rights groups quickly compared Gaither's killing
to that of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old gay college student in
Laramie, Wyo., who was kidnapped last October after leaving a bar
and was then severely beaten and tied to a fence for 18 hours. Two
men have been charged with Shepard's murder.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``What's becoming very clear is that hate in this country is
turning lethal with alarming frequency,'' said David M. Smith, a
spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay and lesbian
political group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gaither had worked for 19 years at a large distribution center
for Russell Corp., a manufacturer of sporting apparel, in Alexander
City, Ala. Bobbie Jo Story, a co-worker at the center, said Gaither
lived with his parents and was well-liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a real nice, loving boy, good hearted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An article Thursday in The Birmingham News quoted Gaither's
father, Marion H. Gaither, as saying that he did not believe his
son had been gay and that he suspected robbery as the motive for
the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said, ``We have no reason to believe that the statements
Mullins and Butler gave us about him being gay are not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Marion Gaither, reached at his home Thursday, declined to
comment.

BLACKMUN AN UNLIKELY FEMINIST HERO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Retired Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who inspired the
wrath and incited the rage of a generation of abortion foes, was
also a feminist hero.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely hero, this slight, quiet judge from Minnesota died
Thursday at the age of 90. With conservative credentials and
President Nixon's endorsement, he changed the course of the
American feminist movement by writing the 1973 Supreme Court's
decision affirming the privacy rights of women and allowing them
access to legal abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark, 7-2 ruling in the Roe v. Wade case went beyond
giving women control of their reproduction and igniting the most
virulent and polarizing social policy debate of the last 25 years.
It said that women had choices, and they were guaranteed for the
first time by the highest court in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, reactions to Blackmun's death were as sweeping and
sharp as the opinion the justice once rightly predicted he would
``carry to my grave.'' Blackmun retired in 1994 after 24 years on
the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are praying for his soul,'' said Judy Brown, president of
the American Life League, an antiabortion group. ``The decision he
wrote has destroyed the lives of millions of children and wrought
havoc on the spiritual well-being of so many women.''
</P>
<P>
   But not for all women. ``Justice Harry Blackmun was my hero,''
said Janet Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law
and Policy, a legal advocacy group in New York. ``Given the chance
to change basic principles of the law, he not only rose to the
occasion, but persevered with increasing force over the years in
his opinions on the importance of women's privacy, equality, and
liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the process,'' Benshoof added, ``he changed both himself
and the flow of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Former US District Judge Robert Bork, a harsh critic, agrees
there was a transformation: Blackmun changed from a traditional
judge to the most liberal member of the court, and he had an
emormous impact by imposing his own morality on society and
``making up constitutional law out of whole cloth,'' Bork said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roe v. Wade was probably the worst Supreme Court decision of
this century,'' said Bork, whose nomination to the Surpreme Court
was rejected by the Senate in 1987. ``If you read his opinion,
which I don't advise, there is not one iota of legal reasoning in
it. He just suddenly says, `there is a right to privacy!' and
that's it _ pure judicial fiat.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun had spent his early career as a lawyer for the Mayo
Clinic in Minnesota, and analysts say he approached abortion in the
Roe case with a larger concern for doctor-patient privacy than for
a women's right to choose. It was only after the decision created a
national firestorm of sometimes violent protest, an unending and
emotional political debate, and dozens of legal challenges that
Blackmun became a fierce and brave protector of abortion and
women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``His shift to the left was entirely related to Roe v. Wade and
the intense, uncompromising criticism it provoked,'' said John
Jeffries, a Supreme Court scholar at the University of Virginia Law
School. ``He saw the hint, the shadow of a threat to Roe, and he
felt an enormous responsibility for it. It was almost like a parent
protecting a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun, an unassuming man, took the energy and diligence he
applied to every task to defending Roe. On the bench, he fought a
losing battle to guarantee federal funds for abortions, but he
never lost the larger legal challenges aimed at reversing the
fundamental right to an abortion set out in Roe.
</P>
<P>
   Off the bench, Blackmun was dogged by antiabortion protesters
and flooded with hate mail. He made a point of reading much of it,
and said he was ``anguished'' by the issue and took the concerns of
his opponents seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But the experience intensified the once-conservative jurist's
passion for civil rights and social justice. In 1986 he dissented
from the court majority that upheld Georgia's anti-gay sodomy law.
He defended affirmative action in education in the 1978 Bakke case.
He joined the majority in ending discrimination against women
serving on juries. And he wrote the majority opinion in a 1991 case
that stopped employers from discriminating against women workers of
child-bearing age.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, Blackmun became an opponent of the death
penalty, calling it a possible violation of the equal protection
clause of the Constitution. In a 1993 interview with National
Public Radio, Blackmun said, ``I don't like the death penalty. I
cringe every time we get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Kathryn Kolbert represented Planned Parenthood, the
reproductive rights organization, in two Supreme Court challenges
to Roe. Blackmun's legacy, she said, was in pushing the court
beyond privacy to see that the right to an abortion was a civil
rights issue, since it made women more equal to men in their
economic and social lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blackmun helped define in the law that women could enter the
world of work and men could enter the world of family,'' said
Kolbert, who is now a senior researcher at the Annenberg Public
Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Roe, the other force shaping Blackmun was his personal
life as a husband and a father to three daughters. He often
referred to them in his opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he died with the knowledge that while there was
certainly vigorous and heartfelt dissent to the Roe decision,
Blackmun was responsible for saving countless women's lives, and
the majority of the country has been in support of the basic
principles of Roe v. Wade,'' said Marcia Greenberger, co-president
of the National Women's Law Center, a private advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   True to the abortion debate, the National Right to Life
Committee vehemently disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roe established the current radical abortion policy that
allows abortion on demand as a method of birth control,'' said
David O'Steen, the antiabortion group's executive director. ``It is
a tragedy for someone to go to his grave best remembered for
denying unborn children the most basic civil liberty _ the right to
life.''

U.S. CALLS CHINA TRADE TALKS `PRODUCTIVE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-ZHOU)

<P>
   BEIJING _ After two days of meetings, China and the United
States have ``made important progress'' in defining terms for China
to join the World Trade Organization, said the United States'
senior trade official. But the official cautioned that there were
still significant differences between the countries and ``a number
of issues remained to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government has exhibited a very serious attitude
and strength of purpose that has helped to make this week
particularly productive,'' said Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade
representative, who said that she had met for over two hours with
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the many caveats, Ms. Barshefsky's remarks were by far
the most optimistic assessment in many months of China's chances of
joining the WTO, the Geneva-based organization that sets the rules
for international trade. She said that her chief negotiators would
remain in the Chinese capital to work on a more detailed plan,
although she refused to elaborate on areas of concern.
</P>
<P>
   China has long sought entry into the organization, but on the
more lenient conditions offered to third-world countries. The
United States has countered that China's economy is too large to be
classed among the world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   Just three months ago, Chinese and U.S. officials were saying
that membership in the organization was a dead issue this year,
convinced that China's current economic slowdown would make it
impossible for the country to open its markets to the extent
required for membership.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of more stringent trade organization entrance
requirements in the future, as well as the need for an image-lift
before Zhu's visit to Washington next month, have rekindled
interest in a deal. On Thursday, Chinese officials seemed
determined to make a run at membership in the organization,
whatever the short-term economic pains.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky said that two or three months ago, Chinese
officials suddenly ``indicated that they wished to re-engage in
earnest'' _ a request that has been followed by a series of
negotiations, culminating in Ms. Barshefsky's visit to Beijing this
week, ``at the request of the Chinese government.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the new enthusiasm is related to the fact that
Taiwan, which China regards as a breakaway province, is itself
concluding membership negotiations. But a stronger impetus seems to
be that the trade organization is expected to redraw the membership
requirements this fall at a meeting in Seattle, and many believe
that entrance requirements will get stiffer at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China doesn't become a member before the Seattle meeting
later this year, the issue will drag on for years,'' said Ji
Chongwei, a senior researcher in the central government's
Development and Research Center. ``I personally think it is hopeful
that China can reach an agreement with the U.S. in the near
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The need to mend fences before Zhu's visit to the United States
next month has also put pressure on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The collegial relationship that the United States and China
built up through early 1998, culminating with President Clinton's
visit last summer, has been deteriorating since late last year,
bruised by Beijing's renewed crackdown on political dissidents and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Although Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright took great
pains to promote cordial engagement when she visited here this
week, the two sides have exchanged harsh words over human rights,
defense policy and technology exchanges in recent months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing and Washington, there is hope that progress toward
China joining the organization would patch up the facade if not the
substance of the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both China and the U.S. hope to make some breakthroughs on
bilateral relations during Zhu Rongji's visit,'' said Xue Ning, a
researcher at the World Trade Organization Shanghai Research
Center, a Chinese government research agency. ``There won't be
progress on issues like Taiwan, human rights, Tibet or religious
belief. So to make the visit look good, both sides have the
incentive to reach some agreement on WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine what kind of deal could emerge or what
trade barriers the Chinese would be willing to drop at a time when
many factories are idle and laying off millions of workers.
</P>
<P>
   They have until now been extremely reluctant to significantly
lower import duties, or to allow foreign companies to operate in
such potentially lucrative sectors as insurance, banking and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   A 100 percent import duty on foreign cars has insured that
middle-class Chinese generally buy tinny domestic models. Many
major Western banks and insurers have set up offices in China in
the hope that the service sector would soon open, but their
representatives now sit idle.
</P>
<P>
   If tariffs were lowered and market access improved, ``Chinese
companies will lose some share'' of the market, Xue said. But there
are potential benefits as well, like greater access to Western
markets at a time when China's exports to countries like Japan and
Thailand have dried up with the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say they believe that any deal would have to
involve a timetable for the gradual lowering of tariffs and opening
of markets over a period of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is done overnight, many Chinese industrial sectors
won't be able to handle it, since China's state-owned enterprises
still have a lot of problems'' said Ji. ``This can only be done
step by step.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if negotiators from the two sides can agree on terms, it
remains to be seen if the U.S. Congress will go along.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, which submits China's most-favored-nation trade status
to an annual review, would have to vote to change that practice in
order for China to be accepted into the WTO, since the
organization's 134 members are automatically granted that status.
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when the Senate is criticizing China's
human-rights record, Congress will certainly require, at the very
least, a solid deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO package will be scrutinized _ it must be real, it must
be tangible,'' Ms. Barshefsky said, adding, ``Accession will only
occur on commercially viable terms.''

UCONN SURVIVES CHALLENGE BY SETON HALL, 57-56 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Incredibly, he wasn't even listed among the league's
top 15 players when it came to announcing the Big East's
all-conference first-, second-, and third-team selections. But, in
an irony of ironies, Kevin Freeman Thursday bolstered his chances
of landing a spot on the all-tournament team by leading the
top-seeded Connecticut Huskies to a 57-56 victory over No. 9 seed
Seton Hall in the quarterfinals of the Big East tourney at Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, a 6-foot-7-inch, 235-pound junior forward from
Springfield, Mass., went over 1,000 points for his career by
leading the Huskies (26-2) with 22 points on 10-for-14 shooting
while grabbing 5 rebounds and scoring a huge offensive board that
gave UConn the lead for good with a minute and a half to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't come here trying to make a point,'' Freeman said,
when asked if he looked to this game as a chance to avenge the
postseason snub by the league's coaches. ``I came here to win _ I
think winning games will make a point to the rest of the league. I
don't look at it as an individual. I think it's more important to
the team if we win these next few games. Then, I think I'll be
alright.''
</P>
<P>
   Said UConn coach Jim Calhoun, whose team advanced to the
semifinals where they will face No. 4 seed Syracuse, a 70-62 winner
over fifth-seeded Villanova, ``He is one of the best 10 or 12
players in the league and clearly he has proven that. Without
question, he is so important for us every single night, and tonight
I think he was the difference in the game, because we didn't have a
particularly good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall coach Tommy Amaker and his Pirates (15-14) had a lot
to do with that. For the third time this season, Amaker deployed a
scheme that called for his team to execute a deliberate,
controlled-tempo game plan that, invariably, frustrated the
up-tempo Huskies and left them panting to bust loose on a big run.
</P>
<P>
   But it never happened, not even when the Pirates lapsed into a 5
minute 14 second drought between baskets. UConn went on an 8-2 run,
but Seton Hall still managed to lead, 18-17, before Richard
Hamilton, the conference Co-Player of the Year, hit for 3 of his 15
points on a trifecta with 12.9 seconds left that gave UConn a 22-21
lead at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   ``They completely dictated the pace.'' Calhoun said of Seton
Hall. ``They did a terrific job of dictating pace. . . .
Psychologically, I thought they did a good job of tantalizing us,
keeping the ball, keeping the ball, and making us frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies were forced to play catch-up for much of the
second-half, managing to stake a pair of 1-point leads (38-37 and
49-48) only to have it immediately wrested away on the following
Seton Hall possession. Until, that is, Freeman, who now has 1,003
career points, broke the 1,000-point barrier e when he converted
Hamilton's errant 3-pointer into a towering offensive putback that
gave the Huskies the lead for good, 51-50, with 1:25 to go. He hen
extended it, 53-50, when he converted Khalid El-Amin's dish off a
dribble-drive lane penetration into an easy low-post dink with 29.2
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Kevin Freeman was just a warrior,'' said Amaker.
``That's the way he's played all year, and that's his style of play
and how tough he can be. He made so many big plays, so many big
plays for their team to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was enough, it seemed, to soften the blow of his postseason
snub.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the guys on the team were upset by it,'' Freeman
said. ``It seemed like Rip (Hamilton), with me not getting on the
team, it really hurt him. And he got Player of the Year and I'm
like, `How can you be mad when you got Player of the Year?' But
it's that sort of respect that we have for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped me out when I had to deal with it the first day or
two,'' he added. ``It was a motivational factor. But I didn't think
I had to go out and score 22 points. If we continue to win, then
they'll have to respect me and know that I might beat you.''

SURVEYS UNCOVER SUBSTANTIAL MELTING OF GREENLAND ICE SHEET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The southern half of the Greenland ice sheet, the second
largest expanse of land-bound ice on earth after Antarctica, has
shrunk substantially in the last five years, scientists have found
in airborne surveys using new and more precise techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have said for some time that a warming atmosphere has
caused many mountain glaciers around the world to shrink. But until
now, they have not known what was happening to the Greenland ice
cap. While five years is too short a period to mark a trend, the
new findings, reported in Thursday's issue of the journal Science,
provide the first precise evidence that it, too, is diminishing.
</P>
<P>
   If the big ice sheets melt even partially, sea levels will rise
around the world. Melting might also disrupt ocean currents that
modulate the earth's climate by distributing heat around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Though the observed shrinkage in Greenland has evidently not had
a major impact so far, it is not trivial. Each year from 1993 to
1998, on average, southern Greenland lost about two cubic miles of
ice, enough to cover Maryland with a sheet one foot thick, said
William B. Krabill, the expert in remote sensing who led the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration team that surveyed
the ice.
</P>
<P>
   In an aircraft equipped with laser altimeters, the team in 1993
and 1994 measured the thickness of the ice across all of Greenland.
Last year, guided by satellite-based positioning that enabled them
to retrace their original path exactly, they resurveyed the
southern half of the island. This year they plan to resurvey the
northern half. The measurements are intended to provide a base line
for continuing studies.
</P>
<P>
   The laser-altimeter method for the first time allowed scientists
to measure the ice well enough to gauge whether it was growing or
shrinking. Remote sensing by satellite proved not sufficiently
sensitive to detail changes on the fringes of the ice sheet, where
most of the shrinkage has taken place.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the shrinkage ``is a little surprising,'' said
Dr. Richard Alley of Pennsylvania State University, an expert on
glaciation and the behavior of ice sheets. He also said the
shrinkage might be related to a general warming of the earth. But
it is unclear at this point whether the shrinkage resulted from
natural or human causes or both.
</P>
<P>
   The earth's average surface temperature has increased by about 1
degree Fahrenheit or a little more since the late 19th century, and
the 1990s have been the warmest decade on record.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature rise compares with a warming of 5 to 9 degrees
since the depths of the last ice age some 20,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant view among experts is that the increase is at least
partly attributable to emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial
gases like carbon dioxide, which are emitted into the atmosphere by
the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream scientists believe the surface temperature will
increase by about another 3.5 degrees in the 21st century if
emissions of the gases are not reduced.
</P>
<P>
   They expect a rise in sea level of about 20 inches to accompany
the warming over the next century, inundating many low-lying areas
of the world. Melting of glacial ice would contribute to that rise,
along with expansion of the ocean's waters as they warm.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, scientists say, warming has two opposing
effects on ice sheets. First, a warmer atmosphere holds more
moisture, which means that heavier snows fall. This snow, when
compacted, thickens the ice. At the same time, warmer temperatures
partly melt the ice sheets at their edges and at lower altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The net effect of these competing influences varies from one
expanse of ice to another and determines whether an ice sheet gets
thinner or thicker on balance.
</P>
<P>
   Krabill's team found that in the western part of southern
Greenland, thickening and thinning of the ice essentially canceled
each other out.
</P>
<P>
   But on the eastern side, thinning outstripped thickening. On
previously unsurveyed areas of the ice sheet's periphery, the
scientists found that large expanses had thinned by nearly eight
inches a year. Nearer the eastern coast, the thinning increased to
more than three feet a year.
</P>
<P>
   The thinning could be accounted for by decreased snowfall or
excessive summertime melting. But Krabill and his team believe it
is more likely that Greenland's glaciers are flowing faster to the
sea, where they break up into icebergs that eventually melt.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers postulated in the Science article that the
glaciers' path might be greased, in effect, as more water melted on
the surface and penetrated to the glacier's bed, lubricating it.
That, they wrote, would mean that Greenland's ice could be
transferred to the ocean faster than it is by melting alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that turns out to be true,'' Alley said, ``that's something
we're going to have to worry about in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Krabill said, ``What we're seeing is something that will not
have an appreciable effect during our lifetime.'' On the other
hand, he said, ``if the trend were to continue, it would be
significant in a long-term sense.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But if the glaciers are flowing more rapidly to the sea, it
would probably mean that an increased number of icebergs would be
breaking off from Greenland and floating free in the Atlantic to
melt, said Dr. Gerard Bond, an expert on glaciation at Columbia
University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. This infusion of
fresh water, Bond said, could disrupt the strength and flow of
dense, salty ocean currents in the North Atlantic by pouring more
fresh water into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   These currents transport heat into the North Atlantic region. If
they weaken, it could set off atmospheric changes that, for
example, would subject Europe to much colder winters.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Bond said, a continuing influx of fresh water
could even touch off a chain of events that might lead at some
point to a new ice age, although he said that was ``a stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Alley said there was a ``potential'' that ``putting more fresh
water into the Atlantic will cause things to change in a hurry.''
He said it was likely that the climate system responded to such
changes as if a light switch were being thrown: A little pressure
may not cause the system to change, but when the pressure reaches a
certain point, it flips suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   Putting more ice into the Atlantic, he said, ``would be pushing
it in the direction of doing something.'' But he said scientists
``have no clue'' as to whether the latest findings from Greenland
represented a significant push on the switch and whether the switch
was close to flipping.

<P>
   Just say ``station wagon'' and any baby boomer's brain starts
flipping through its memory book: driveway car washes, car pools
and Dinah Shore beckoning fresh-faced families to ``See the U.S.A.
in your Chevrolet.''
</P>
<P>
   Big station wagons with three rows of seats and faux wood
paneling on the side have been only a memory ever since minivans
and sport utility trucks became the family vehicles of choice.
</P>
<P>
   But minivans and sport utilities drive like trucks because they
(italics) are (end italics) trucks. If you want some room but want
to drive something that makes you smile, is there salvation from
minivan and sport utility madness?
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where station wagon memories linger, Audi and BMW are
the latest car makers to believe they have an alternative for the
thinking driver.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful engines up front, sizable room in the rear and plenty
of leather and wood trim in the middle. Grab the wheel, touch the
pedal and instantly you have the pleasure of sure-footed handling
and heady acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   And four-wheel drive? Fancy traction control packages, which do
the trick for virtually everybody, are available from BMW and
Mercedes. Audi and Mercedes also offer all-wheel drive; in fact, it
is standard on Audi's pleasant midsize wagon, the A6 Avant.
</P>
<P>
   As for seating, the Audi and the Mercedes E320 wagon can handle
up to seven in three rows. In the Audi, the rear-facing third row
is for children only, but the roomier Mercedes can seat two compact
adults _ though no one would want to sit there long. The BMW, a
five-seater, forgoes a rumble seat.
</P>
<P>
   The wagon rebirth is intended to appeal to people who camp, ski
or scuba _ or look as if they do _ and want the zip of a
performance sedan at the tip of their toes and the prowess of its
road-holding in their hands and don't want a sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year or so, sales of midsize luxury wagons have
risen 50 percent, suggesting that there may indeed be a meaty niche
here. Volvo's all-wheel drive V70 XC AWD wagon is its best-selling
car. Saab is about to unveil its first wagon in 20 years. Even
Jaguar is rumored to be preparing to leap in.
</P>
<P>
   But can they really carry the load of a minivan or a sport
utility?
</P>
<P>
   No. While designers have worked hard to prevent rear wheel wells
from encroaching on space, and a network of cargo nets allows you
to pile your gear high, the Audi and the BMW do not have as much
cargo room as a Ford Explorer or even a Volvo wagon.
</P>
<P>
   With the Audi, I kept running out of room for golf clubs,
suitcases and the like on a family trip. But if you can regularly
lighten your load, there is true joy behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   BMW introduced its 5-series sport wagon in October after being
off the wagon train for a few years. It delivers BMW's trademark
handling with aggressive power. Take a turn, even at high speed,
and you seem magnetized to the road.
</P>
<P>
   The magicians in Munich have shaped that sense of harmony
between car and driver. Simply put, you lead the car; the car
doesn't lead you.
</P>
<P>
   There are two power plants, a 2.8 liter, six-cylinder with 193
horsepower for the 528i, and a 4.4 liter V8 yielding 282 horses
that turns the more expensive 540i into a muscle machine. By
comparison, the Audi and Mercedes engines, both V6s, fall in
between at 200 and 221 horsepower, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 528i is the lightest, it seems to accelerate without
hesitation. Not so for its German competitors, which both seem a
tad underpowered for their weight.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the BMW V8 overpowers everything in the class, moving
from 0 to 60 miles an hour in a slender 6.3 seconds. The price for
this neck-snapping fun is a $1,300 gas guzzler tax and dismal fuel
economy: 15 miles a gallon in the city, 21 on the highway.

   WASHINGTON _ Retired Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who inspired the
wrath and incited the rage of a generation of abortion foes, was
also a feminist hero.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely hero, this slight, quiet judge from Minnesota died
Thursday at the age of 90. With conservative credentials and
President Nixon's endorsement, he changed the course of the
American feminist movement by writing the 1973 Supreme Court's
decision affirming the privacy rights of women and allowing them
access to legal abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark, 7-2 ruling in the Roe v. Wade case went beyond
giving women control of their reproduction and igniting the most
virulent and polarizing social policy debate of the last 25 years.
It said that women had choices, and they were guaranteed for the
first time by the highest court in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, reactions to Blackmun's death were as sweeping and
sharp as the opinion the justice once rightly predicted he would
``carry to my grave.'' Blackmun retired in 1994 after 24 years on
the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are praying for his soul,'' said Judy Brown, president of
the American Life League, an antiabortion group. ``The decision he
wrote has destroyed the lives of millions of children and wrought
havoc on the spiritual well-being of so many women.''
</P>
<P>
   But not for all women. ``Justice Harry Blackmun was my hero,''
said Janet Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law
and Policy, a legal advocacy group in New York. ``Given the chance
to change basic principles of the law, he not only rose to the
occasion, but persevered with increasing force over the years in
his opinions on the importance of women's privacy, equality, and
liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the process,'' Benshoof added, ``he changed both himself
and the flow of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Former US District Judge Robert Bork, a harsh critic, agrees
there was a transformation: Blackmun changed from a traditional
judge to the most liberal member of the court, and he had an
emormous impact by imposing his own morality on society and
``making up constitutional law out of whole cloth,'' Bork said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roe v. Wade was probably the worst Supreme Court decision of
this century,'' said Bork, whose nomination to the Surpreme Court
was rejected by the Senate in 1987. ``If you read his opinion,
which I don't advise, there is not one iota of legal reasoning in
it. He just suddenly says, `there is a right to privacy!' and
that's it _ pure judicial fiat.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun had spent his early career as a lawyer for the Mayo
Clinic in Minnesota, and analysts say he approached abortion in the
Roe case with a larger concern for doctor-patient privacy than for
a women's right to choose. It was only after the decision created a
national firestorm of sometimes violent protest, an unending and
emotional political debate, and dozens of legal challenges that
Blackmun became a fierce and brave protector of abortion and
women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``His shift to the left was entirely related to Roe v. Wade and
the intense, uncompromising criticism it provoked,'' said John
Jeffries, a Supreme Court scholar at the University of Virginia Law
School. ``He saw the hint, the shadow of a threat to Roe, and he
felt an enormous responsibility for it. It was almost like a parent
protecting a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun, an unassuming man, took the energy and diligence he
applied to every task to defending Roe. On the bench, he fought a
losing battle to guarantee federal funds for abortions, but he
never lost the larger legal challenges aimed at reversing the
fundamental right to an abortion set out in Roe.
</P>
<P>
   Off the bench, Blackmun was dogged by antiabortion protesters
and flooded with hate mail. He made a point of reading much of it,
and said he was ``anguished'' by the issue and took the concerns of
his opponents seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But the experience intensified the once-conservative jurist's
passion for civil rights and social justice. In 1986 he dissented
from the court majority that upheld Georgia's anti-gay sodomy law.
He defended affirmative action in education in the 1978 Bakke case.
He joined the majority in ending discrimination against women
serving on juries. And he wrote the majority opinion in a 1991 case
that stopped employers from discriminating against women workers of
child-bearing age.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, Blackmun became an opponent of the death
penalty, calling it a possible violation of the equal protection
clause of the Constitution. In a 1993 interview with National
Public Radio, Blackmun said, ``I don't like the death penalty. I
cringe every time we get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Kathryn Kolbert represented Planned Parenthood, the
reproductive rights organization, in two Supreme Court challenges
to Roe. Blackmun's legacy, she said, was in pushing the court
beyond privacy to see that the right to an abortion was a civil
rights issue, since it made women more equal to men in their
economic and social lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blackmun helped define in the law that women could enter the
world of work and men could enter the world of family,'' said
Kolbert, who is now a senior researcher at the Annenberg Public
Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Roe, the other force shaping Blackmun was his personal
life as a husband and a father to three daughters. He often
referred to them in his opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he died with the knowledge that while there was
certainly vigorous and heartfelt dissent to the Roe decision,
Blackmun was responsible for saving countless women's lives, and
the majority of the country has been in support of the basic
principles of Roe v. Wade,'' said Marcia Greenberger, co-president
of the National Women's Law Center, a private advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   True to the abortion debate, the National Right to Life
Committee vehemently disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roe established the current radical abortion policy that
allows abortion on demand as a method of birth control,'' said
David O'Steen, the antiabortion group's executive director. ``It is
a tragedy for someone to go to his grave best remembered for
denying unborn children the most basic civil liberty _ the right to
life.''

 UNDATED: the highway.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only BMW offers a manual transmission: a five-speed, on the 528i
only. It also offers its sporty M package, a $2,470 option, that
includes 17-inch wheels, high-performance tires and a drum-tight
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the power train, the BMW's dimensions don't differ. The
interior is the usual BMW mix of instrumentation, leather and
walnut. The doors close like those on a bank vault. It is also the
shortest of the cars. While that makes parking easier, it means
rear legroom is tighter and cargo room is less than in the Audi or
the Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   The Audi, on the other hand, is the longest and widest of the
threesome but the roof line is the lowest. That results in plenty
of compliments because the long, low profile is nicely proportioned
and eye-catching. Rear legroom is exceptionally generous.
Surprisingly, headroom is not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   It also has an exceptionally inviting interior. The terra cotta
color scheme in Audi's ``Advance'' motif has inlays atop the shift
console, the center of the instrument panel and along all four
doors.
</P>
<P>
   The seats adjust a dozen ways and have three lumbar settings.
Door pockets open out like bins, and thoughtfully designed lighting
is found at each door opening, above the rear seats and even neatly
tucked into the ceiling, to light a mirrors on the visors.
</P>
<P>
   Audi offers a third seat as a $700 option, but it seems
impractical. Because it does not fold away completely, it limits
cargo space. It can be removed, but it's 40 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercedes does offer a third row that folds down completely
and it has the most room by far behind the rear seats. The
rear-wheel-drive version starts at about $48,000 and the
all-wheel-drive wagon begins at just above $50,000. The BMW 540i is
the most expensive, though, starting at $54,050.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of safety these three wagon masters are similar. Each
has two front air bags in the dash and side air bags for the two
front passengers. Rear air bags are optional at Audi and BMW, not
available on the Mercedes. BMW has head protection bags above the
front seat as standard equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Where do they differ? Tailgate doors on the Audi and the
Mercedes are one piece; the BMW door conveniently allows you to
open the door or just the window, and it's lighter. Audi's steering
wheel design hides the cruise control and high-beam stick on the
left and the wiper control on the right. The Mercedes cruise
control and turn signal stalk are so close together you can
accidentally accelerate when you mean to be signal.
</P>
<P>
   One other notable difference: Audi carries a three-year, 50,000
mile warranty, BMW and Mercedes add an additional year.
</P>
<P>
   Children of the 50s would hardly recognize these performance
wagons from the family cars of their youth. But they'd certainly
appreciate them.
</P>
<P>
   On a drive with the BMW 528i, my wife and I left for dinner,
forgetting a bottle of wine we needed for the meal. Taking the
manual transmission through the paces on a lake shore road was so
much fun I took the long route. ``We need to go back for the wine,
and you'd better hurry,'' she warned.
</P>
<P>
   Did she say hurry? &QL;

FLYING HIGH, OR NOT, AFTER A PROMOTION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., N.Y., N.C.)   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   (italics)Life, like footballs, takes some funny bounces.
Sometimes the promises of promotion and big titles hide a reality
that proves disappointing. And sometimes disappointment turns out
to be the key to the door to advancement.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, when Edward McManus was working in a ladies' sportswear
business in the Garment District of Manhattan, he got his first
executive promotion. His boss had bought a small regional airline
and decided to make McManus its vice president of customer
relations _ in addition to keeping him on as manager of showroom
sales for the main business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no extra money,'' McManus recalled the boss saying,
``but the title will look good on your resume.''
</P>
<P>
   McManus, who now lives in Marlborough, Mass., said the airline
consisted of an eight-passenger twin-engine Beechcraft. It flew
twice a day between Fitchburg, Mass., home of the sportswear
factory, and the Butler Aviation terminal at La Guardia Airport.
The airline counted on Butler for fuel, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We refueled on credit and then took off before they noticed we
owed them a lot of money,'' McManus wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But one day, Butler rebelled, insisting on cash for fuel until
the corporate bill was paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had our plane on the tarmac with eight paying passengers and
no fuel,'' McManus recalled. ``I called my boss and told him what
had happened. `You're a vice president!' he shouted. `Think of
something!' He hung up.''
</P>
<P>
   McManus boarded the plane and told the passengers that as a
result of a grievous misunderstanding the airline, was unable to
get its fuel on credit. The passengers became restive. McManus
quickly assured them that if each of them gave him $20, he could
buy the necessary fuel and have them home in no time. And the
advance would be credited against future fares.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, the passengers began to ante up.
</P>
<P>
   ``One older gentleman glared at me as I approached his seat,''
McManus wrote. ``He slapped a $20 in my hand, and then another
$10.''
</P>
<P>
   McManus asked, ``What's the extra $10 for?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Check the oil,'' the man said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   About 10 years ago, Maureen Duffin-Ward of Raleigh, N.C., was
working as an account executive at Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding, a large
advertising agency in Philadelphia. Even better, her client was the
Bell Atlantic Yellow Pages, the agency's biggest account. And even
better than that, the television commercials for the client were
filmed in New York or Los Angeles and often involved celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled that the management supervisor, then the No. 1
person on the account, said he had a great opportunity for her: She
could become an account supervisor _ but not for Bell Atlantic and
not for the agency, either. He was leaving to become president of a
smaller agency and wanted her to join him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more politics,'' she recalled him saying. ``More money, and
a bigger office than the one you have. And a southern exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duffin-Ward looked up the agency in a directory. With 65
employees, it sounded small. ``But my ficus would have a shot,''
she remembered thinking. ``And I just loved this boss. He wouldn't
steer me wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   On her first day on the new job, a colleague took her around to
meet everyone. When they were finished, she asked, ``Is there
another floor?'' The colleague seemed confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I read that you have 65 people, and that was more like
11,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that must have included our Chicago and Cleveland offices,
too,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duffin-Ward walked back to her office, disappointed. Then
she went to lunch with her boss to meet her new client, a designer
of industrial fasteners.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, the boss told her more about the agency. ``We don't
do TV or radio, even newspapers,'' she remembered him saying.
``It's all business-to-business.'' With clients who sold only to
other businesses, she wouldn't even be producing ads that the
public would see.
</P>
<P>
   There was more, in the same depressing vein, and Ms. Duffin-Ward
was convinced that she had made a terrible mistake.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of family and friends, she decided to stick it
out for a year. ``And I learned a lot about businesses I had never
heard of,'' she wrote. ``Almost a year to the day, I gave my
two-week notice, having landed a six-figure sales job at a local
television station. They were impressed by my `entrepreneurial'
position, thinking it would prepare me for new business sales.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So in retrospect,'' she said of her detour into unhappiness,
``it was the best job I ever had _ good luck in disguise, for
sure.''

REPUBLICANS STALL AID PACKAGE PRIOR TO CLINTON'S CENTRAL AMERICAN
TRIP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans have stalled emergency
legislation to provide Central America with almost $1 billion in
disaster aid as President Clinton prepared for a four-day tour of
the hurricane-stricken region.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the House and Senate ordered budget-writers to not
push the relief bills until they come up with ways to pay for the
aid, a directive that some lawmakers say would mean cutting
domestic programs coveted by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing $956 million to help Honduras,
Nicaragua and other nations battered by hurricanes Mitch and
Georges, the emergency spending measure also would provide $152
million in relief for U.S. farmers and $100 million for Jordan to
build up its military and repay debts in the wake of King Hussein's
death.
</P>
<P>
   To finance Clinton's emergency spending proposals, the
Republican-controlled Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday
approved a relief package that would be funded by reduced spending
_ called offsets _ in a variety of federal programs, including food
stamps for poor Americans and environmental programs pushed by Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   At the behest of GOP leaders, the House Appropriations Committee
postponed a vote, originally set for Thursday, on a similar bill.
``Finding doable and credible offsets involves a delicate balance
because there's a danger of losing votes,'' said Elizabeth Morra, a
committee spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The White House immediately accused the Republican leadership of
playing politics instead of helping deal with the crises. ``If you
look at the menu of things put down (for cuts), it has the real
scent of politics to it,'' said presidential spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle joined in the criticism,
accusing Republicans of taking away ``assistance for the needy in
this country to pay for assistance for the needy in Honduras.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said, ``There is a
general feeling we ought to find offsets'' to pay for the aid
Clinton wants for Central America. ``It's not politics; it's budget
responsibility,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had proposed financing the aid by using part of the $109
billion federal surplus expected this year. House leaders, quick to
portray themselves as more fiscally responsible than the Democratic
president, decided against using the surplus, pointing out that
Clinton earlier had wanted it reserved to save Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we spend money, we won't steal it out of Social Security,
and that's the first case out of the box,'' said conservative Rep.
Tom Coburn, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   If a compromise is not found, the bill might die on the floor of
the House or the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get the bill through and didn't think it would be
difficult at all,'' said a spokeswoman for Democrats on the House
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The delays come four days before Clinton is to tour communities
in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras that were heavily damaged in
October when Hurricane Mitch swept through the region. The
president also is to meet with Central American leaders gathering
for a summit in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Considered the worst natural disaster on record in the Western
Hemisphere, Hurricane Mitch killed more than 9,000 people, left
more than 3 million homeless and destroyed more than $8.5 billion
worth of property.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Clinton asked Congress to provide enhanced trade
benefits to speed economic recovery in the stricken Central
American countries and several in the Caribbean hit by Hurricane
Georges.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the new measure
would eliminate U.S. tariffs on certain textile and apparel
products. The benefits would apply from Oct. 1, 1999 to June 30,
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The president Thursday also appointed former Florida Gov. Buddy
MacKay as special envoy to the Americas, a $125,000-a-year post
vacated months ago when Thomas F. ``Mack'' McLarty returned to
private business.
</P>
<P>
   McKay, who lost to Republican Jeb Bush in last fall's race for
governor, was Florida's lieutenant governor until December, when
Gov. Lawton Chiles died in mid-December. MacKay served three weeks
as governor before turning the office over to Bush.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every day after school and on weekends, Federica
Bautista, 18, sells fruit, vegetables and flowers from a pushcart
stationed at the entrance to Flushing Meadows Corona Park in
Queens. When it's cold outside, she takes delivery orders by
telephone at her home, a two-bedroom apartment she shares with
seven relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Her weekly earnings of $100 to $150 on sales of $400 help
support her widowed mother and her 2-year-old son, Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bautista, a single mother who emigrated from Mexico in 1991,
used to fear for her financial future. But last year, she helped
her family to escape welfare after she completed an after-school
program offered by the National Foundation for Teaching
Entrepreneurship. The foundation provides students in poor urban
neighborhoods with training and seed capital to start their own
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The group is one of about 20 nonprofit agencies authorized by
school boards across the country to teach business literacy. The
largest of these, Junior Achievement, reaches more than 3.1 million
students, up 17 percent last year, by bringing business people into
the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of our kids are disconnected from opportunities and
options available to them from our economic system,'' said James B.
Hayes, chief executive of Junior Achievement, based in Colorado
Springs. ``For many, their only example is playing for the Chicago
Bulls or selling narcotics.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the groups are going a step beyond the literacy training
by teaching students to run their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship had its
own origins in New York, after Steve Mariotti, a high school
teacher in the South Bronx, saw the effects of narcotics and
violence on his students. With no understanding of how the economy
worked, many still dreamed of having their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   To teach them, Mariotti established the foundation in 1988.
Eleven years later, it has a budget of $5 million a year, with
22,000 graduate entrepreneurs and offices across the country. Major
donors are the Koch family foundations, the Heinz endowments, Fleet
Bank, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Microsoft and the Ronald
McDonald House Charities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bautista turned to the foundation after seeing a poster at
school. She learned everything from how to write a business plan to
how to negotiate with wholesalers. Later, she received $50 toward
the cost of opening her flower and fruit stand.
</P>
<P>
   Among other agencies, Rural Entrepreneurship Through Action
Learning, or REAL Enterprises, based in Durham, N.C., trains
entrepreneurs in rural areas across the country. Among its
successes are Spencer Hall, 18, who started Expertise Computers in
1994 in Deer Park, Wash. Today, with $750,000 in sales and five
employees, Hall installs computer systems for small businesses,
professionals and schools.
</P>
<P>
   Every state has some form of entrepreneurship education. But
tight budgets often limit the offerings to relatively few students.
</P>
<P>
   To expand the reach, the National Foundation for Teaching
Entrepreneurship, in partnership with Microsoft, plans to start
BizTech, an on-line entrepreneurial learning system at www.nfte.com
in May.
</P>
<P>
   Some past sponsors of entrepreneurship programs have had second
thoughts. Gary Kaplan, executive director of Jobs for Youth Boston,
ran entrepreneurial programs until 1991. He now says that, with 25
percent of the population functionally illiterate, ``teaching
entrepreneurship is not a substitute for teaching reading, math and
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a measure that would have allocated $60 million to
states for entrepreneurship education in public schools stalled in
Congress. Its sponsors plan to try again this spring.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Bautista, she now plans to go to college. ``I want to
become a teacher or perhaps study medicine,'' she said. ``But I
will still want to have my own business.''

   When Thomas C. Matzzie graduated from the University of Notre
Dame in 1997 with a degree in economics, he decided not to follow
many of his classmates into high-paying careers on Wall Street or
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he took a lower-paying job, as a policy analyst at the
Institute for America's Future, a liberal research organization in
Washington.

   Matzzie, 23, who grew up near Pittsburgh, credits Medicare _ of
all things _ with giving him the chance to follow his interests
rather than chase a big salary. ``When I was a senior in high
school, my grandmother _ who has since died _ became very ill,'' he
recalled. ``Medicare was there and helped pay the expenses that
would otherwise have bankrupted our family. Because of Medicare I
was able to go on to college and then have the freedom to do
nonprofit work that pays less, because I know that the burden of
taking care of my parents will be a lot less with Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he won't use Medicare himself for another 40-plus years,
Mattzie sees how his well-being depends on it. If only the same
could be said for the broader public, whose awareness seems to have
dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   In the current debate over the program's future, many people
have forgotten and others are too young to know what it was like
before 1966, when Medicare began. Back then, young people feared
that caring for a sick parent, retired and no longer covered by
health insurance, could ruin them.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore R. Marmor, a professor of politics at the Yale School
of Management and the author of ``The Politics of Medicare,''
(Aldine, 1998) says a founding principle of Medicare was the
``importance of relieving children of the financial catastrophe
that illness could mean for their parents and then for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That understanding has been weakened to the point of
amnesia,'' he added, partly because Medicare's benefits have come
to be taken for granted, and partly because the financial relief
they offer has been blunted by growing drug and nursing home costs,
which the program doesn't cover.
</P>
<P>
   Another founding principle of Medicare is threatened by a
proposal to split it in two, allowing a choice between the
traditional plan, with the government paying the bills, and the
chance to shop for private insurance whose premiums the government
would largely pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This so-called premium-support proposal, which is really a
voucher plan, would undermine Medicare as a social insurance
program,'' Marmor said. ``People would face a dizzying array of
private plans and would have to pay the difference between a
federal voucher and the cost of a health plan. This would shift the
risks of inflation to the elderly and to health plans and away from
the Medicare program itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ideological attack and an effort to reject by
stealth the social insurance premises of the Medicare program,'' he
said. ``It rejects the original notion that Medicare should be a
common program for everybody who is over 65.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, wealthier elderly Americans could have
better coverage. That, he argues, would encourage one Medicare
program for the affluent and another for everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   This solution is hardly the only way to rescue Medicare, Marmor
said. He cites Congressional Budget Office figures showing that
raising the Medicare payroll tax to 2.02 percent, from 1.45
percent, would keep Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund in
balance through 2025. Someone making $40,000 a year would pay an
additional $228 a year, or 62 cents a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we to believe that the public is unwilling to accept tax
increases of this magnitude to support the growing numbers of their
parents and grandparents who become eligible for Medicare?'' he
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Mayer certainly wouldn't object to such an increase,
both to insure the program's future and to pay for prescription
drugs. Ms. Mayer, 83, of New Bedford, Mass., is the oldest student
at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, where she will
receive a BA degree in June.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the days before Medicare, she sees the program as a
reflection of our values. ``It's important to us as a society that
we take care of people,'' she said.

FUNDS VOICE OPPOSITION TO OLIVETTI'S BID FOR ITALIAN PHONE
COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Olivetti, Italy's No. 2 phone company, has yet to begin
its formal $60 billion bid for the country's largest phone company,
Telecom Italia, but large British and U.S. investment funds are
complaining that as the biggest shareholders in the target company
they may be getting a bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the grumbling is about Olivetti's price for
Telecom _ 10 euros, or $11, a share, to be paid in a mix of cash
and securities, which they say is far too low for a phone company
some believe is worth at least 30 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   Big U.S. and British funds also object to the bid's implications
for the future of shareholder rights in Europe. The bid is moving
ahead under revised Italian takeover and corporate governance
regulations aimed at making the process more open and fairer to
shareholders. But some fund managers protest that the deal looks
more like old-style European capitalism, in which corporate control
is exercised through opaque financial holding companies and
minority investors find their rights trampled.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover attempt represents the first time a purchase would
be financed through the huge new euro-denominated securities market
taking shape following the introduction of the single European
currency in January.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti's bid, announced less than two weeks ago, is led by its
chief executive, Roberto Colaninno. He is the head of an investor
group in a holding company called Fingruppo SpA. In cascading
fashion, Fingruppo owns a 39 percent share in a Luxembourg-based
holding company called Bell SA, and Bell in turn holds a
controlling 12 percent stake in Olivetti.
</P>
<P>
   But the chain does not end there. Olivetti will start the bid
through a gaming machinery subsidiary called Tecnost, and some
investors fear that Tecnost and Telecom may be merged, if the bid
succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The fight for Telecom Italia is gaining additional attention
because it comes just as another high profile company, the Italian
fashion group Gucci, is trying to repel a hostile takeover by the
French luxury goods maker, LVMH. A Dutch court began hearings this
week to decide whether Gucci's defense is legal.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti won approval to make &UR;  &LR; a bid from the Italian stock
market regulator, Consob.
</P>
<P>
   The company is now in the phase of gathering financing and
preparing a prospectus for the formal bid which is expected in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom and its chief executive, Franco Bernabe, are preparing
to defend themselves. In a board meeting called Thursday in Milan,
the Telecom board was expected to review plans by Bernabe to merge
Telecom with its profitable wireless phone unit, Telecom Italia
Mobile, a move that would not only make sense by offering customers
single number service through both fixed line and mobile
connections, but would raise the value of Telecom, possibly beyond
Olivetti's reach.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti and its advisers have kept a low profile, in part not
to upset the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United
States. Olivetti has chosen not to raise financing for the takeover
in the United States, and its advisers say that is to avoid lengthy
U.S. procedures that would slow the timing of the bid. But here too
the big U.S. investment funds are critical. They suspect that the
intention is to skirt tougher U.S. takeover rules that might upset
Olivetti's designs.
</P>
<P>
   To foil Olivetti, Bernabe must gather the votes of shareholders
controlling 30 percent of Telecom's capital. Telecom's core
shareholders, mainly Italian banks and investment groups, represent
about 7.5 percent of that capital; more than half is controlled by
British and U.S. investment funds.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the large funds to go public with objections was
Standard Life Investments, the asset management arm of Standard
Life Assurance Co. of Britain. Leon de Jerez, director of
continental European equity investments, is blunt about his
objections to Olivetti's bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal itself is too cheap,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``Ten euros is not the right price.''
</P>
<P>
   He also objected to how the deal would be financed, which would,
in his view, so increase Telecom's debt as to weaken the company
competitively.
</P>
<P>
   But his larger objections, he said, go farther. Olivetti wants
to take control of Telecom by purchasing only its common stock with
voting rights, ignoring non-voting shares. Moreover, Colaninno and
the investors backing him would acquire Telecom through a company
called Tecnost that Olivetti fully controls, but their control of
Olivetti itself is through minority stakes in two holding
companies, one of them being Bell, which is based in Luxembourg. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR;  &LR; Some fund managers suspect that Olivetti's ultimate
intention is to merge Tecnost with Telecom after the takeover.
``You would wind up with nonvoting shares in Tecnost,'' said Frank
Semack, a fund manager at Federated Global Research Corp. in New
York, a unit of Federated Investing.
</P>
<P>
   Other U.S. asset managers with stakes in Telecom, including
TIAA-CREF, the private pension fund for teachers in New York, USAA
Investment Management Company of San Antonio, and Janus Funds of
Denver, are said to oppose the Olivetti bid because it is too low,
includes debt and securities they do not want, and would likely
force out Bernabe, a proven manger they trust.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Gartman, legal counsel at the Investor Responsibility
Research Center in Washington, said that Europe was not alone in
experiencing the kind of deal Olivetti contemplates. In the United
States, he said, despite cries of foul from minority shareholders,
corporate predators will have a subsidiary take a stake in a target
company, then merge the subsidiary with the target.
</P>
<P>
   The Olivetti bid, said John Bennett, a fund manager in London at
Global Asset Management, which ranks Telecom among its top 10
investments in Europe, is a ``test case'' for the Italian stock
market regulator.

KOCH GIVES DISPUTED ANCIENT COINS TO TURKEY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Greece)   By BARRY MEIER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Turkish government got 1,700 coins Thursday. William I. Koch
got one. So ended one of the most bitter disputes over antiquities
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Turkish officials and Koch, an investor
known for his 1992 victory in the America's Cup yacht race and
taste for litigation, have battled in court over a treasure trove
that included the rarest and most valuable Greek coins ever found.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials insisted the treasure had been illegally dug
up in Turkey in the early 1980s, smuggled out of the country to
Germany and eventually sold to Koch, who then was a trustee of the
Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Koch contended the coins he and his partners bought were not the
ones sought by Turkey. However, some of the coins in dispute, which
were issued around 465 B.C. and are called decadrachms of Athens,
are so rare that it seemed impossible for there to be two separate
caches of them.
</P>
<P>
   Koch said in an interview last year that he was a coin novice
and had purchased the ancient coins in the hope of turning a quick
profit. But his troubles began soon after buying the coins for $3.2
million when Ozgen Acar, a Turkish journalist who specialized in
antiquities, began to investigate an illegal dig in Turkey. In a
1988 article in Connoisseur magazine, he and a co-author described
how the trail led to Koch.
</P>
<P>
   A legal battle ensued. Both Koch and the Turkish government
threw sizeable resources into it, hiring investigators and even
horticultural experts who battled over the timing of certain events
based on the flowers that happened to be in bloom.
</P>
<P>
   With a trial set to begin next week, Koch apparently decided to
concede, though not before extracting a measure of dignity from
Turkish officials. In a ceremony at the Turkish Embassy in
Washington Thursday, Koch gave the 1,700 coins to Turkey. A Turkish
official gave him a coin-shaped medal.

DENNIS HOPPER SELLS WILMINGTON, N.C., LANDMARK 
</HEADLINE>
 (mk) 
 By JOSIAH CANTWELL The (Wilmington, N.C.) Morning Star   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Actor Dennis Hopper has sold a 100-year-old
former Masonic temple here, but will keep an apartment he built in
the downtown building.
</P>
<P>
   John Sutton, a developer from Ocean Isle Beach, bought the
building and said he plans to put a restaurant and another business
on the ground floor, with offices on the second floor and
apartments above that.
</P>
<P>
   An old theater on the top floor will be renovated and will be
available to rent for plays, film screenings and other uses.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton said he plans to invest several million dollars by the
time he's through with the project. Work on the renovation is
already under way.
</P>
<P>
   The property is valued at $460,000, according to county tax
records. Hopper bought the building for $150,000 in 1992, records
show.
</P>
<P>
   The building has been vacant since Buy-Rite Discount Store moved
out in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Hopper made substantial repairs to the exterior of the building,
which has a facade of ornate stonework. The actor had hoped to
establish a performing arts academy in the building. But a plan to
get state funding for the project fell through in 1994 amid
squabbling over the charter of the academy.
</P>
<P>
   Hopper first came to Wilmington in 1985 to film ``Blue Velvet,''
which was directed by David Lynch and was one of the first major
films to be made in Wilmington. As the town's film industry grew,
Hopper made the town an East Coast base. In 1994 he directed an
independent film here called ``Chasers,'' and he appeared in
``Super Mario Brothers,'' which was filmed here and released in
1993.

 &HT;    Dell to buy $16 billion in IBM equipment
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ Continuing its string of major announcements
as it reacts to a rapidly changing market, Dell Computer Corp. said
Thursday it will buy an estimated $16 billion in advanced IBM
equipment over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM agreement _ coupled with Dell's launch Wednesday of an
online store that will offer more than 30,000 products and a
previous signal that Dell will offer a personal computer line for
under $1,000 _ suggests that in 1999 Dell will move well beyond its
bread-and-butter business of making PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The wide-ranging pact between two companies that compete
fiercely on some fronts, also illustrates IBM's steps to emphasize
its businesses that bring better returns than the PC market,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the busy week of announcements, Dell
officials say the changes are consistent with Dell's strategies of
exploiting the fast-growing business potential of the Internet and
making heftier, more profitable computer systems for the most
lucrative corporate accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Art Russell, an analyst with Edward Jones &AMP; Co. in St. Louis,
said he doesn't expect Dell to reinvent itself. But the company,
based in Round Rock, is feeling pressure to boost revenue after its
recent announcement that revenue growth slowed to 38 percent in the
fourth quarter, breaking more than eight consecutive quarters of
growth over 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that their growth is slowing, they've got to
re-evaluate the markets they play in and target some of these other
opportunities,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly behind Dell's suggestion that it will enter the
sub-$1,000 PC business, a market it had no interest in a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dell officials say these moves are evolutionary, not
revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like this is a new start. It's just execution of
previously stated strategy,'' Dell spokesman Peter Scacco said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wall Street was disappointed with Thursday's
announcement, which the companies said was the biggest of its kind,
after analysts learned it was not a service link between Dell and
IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Speculative reports published early Thursday indicated the two
companies would announce that IBM's huge service team, some 120,000
people strong, would support Dell's growing enterprise business of
supplying powerful server computers to the world's biggest
companies.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, both stocks gave up impressive early gains. After
climbing nearly $3 early, Dell closed up 93 3/4 cents at $81.87
1/2. IBM closed at $170.93 3/4, after reaching $176 earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got snookered by this thing,'' said Lou Mazzacchelli of
Gerard Klauer Mattison. ``It's certainly not the level of impact
that a service agreement or something else could have been.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a parts agreement,'' said Jim Poyner of CIBC Oppenheimer
after an IBM conference call with analysts that followed the
announcement in New York. ``$16 billion is not a contract number.
It's IBM's estimate of what Dell would take over time.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM already supplies Dell with disk drives. The new agreement is
much broader, including IBM memory chips, flat-panel displays and
other components.
</P>
<P>
   Although the agreement does not give Dell exclusive rights to
IBM's technology, the two companies said it allows each to use the
other's patented technology and opens the way for joint development
of new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised to learn this morning that $16 billion was the
largest agreement ever announced,'' Dell senior vice president Mike
Lambert said during the announcement in New York. ``It could even
be a better partnership than even those numbers might suggest.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is consistent with Dell's strategy of leveraging
available research and development investment in the PC industry
rather than paying to develop what already exists.
</P>
<P>
   IBM spent more than $5 billion on research and development in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to be able to tap into that research and work closely
with that company gives us an awful lot of flexibility,'' Lambert
said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has estimated that information technology services was a
$460 billion business worldwide in 1998. It includes designing,
installing and maintaining complex computer networks, which often
run competing operating systems such as Windows and Unix. The
systems typically link a big company's operations of tens of
thousands of PCs in dozens of countries.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, the world's biggest computer company, offers the broadest
range of products in the industry, from the most powerful mainframe
computers to software. Its service business grew 21 percent in 1998
to $23.4 billion, contributing more than a fourth of the $81.7
billion in revenue. But for much of last year, IBM's PC business
struggled, in part because Dell's direct model revealed the
inefficiencies of traditional PC suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   That had helped fuel speculation that IBM might ask Dell to
assemble some of its PCs in Dell's highly efficient factories.
Dell, the No. 2 PC maker behind Compaq Computer Corp., had revenue
of $18.3 billion in its most recent fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Dell's efficiency and minimal inventory have allowed
it to squeeze extraordinary profit from a relatively narrow
hardware product line. It was only in 1997 that Dell entered the
business for servers, which are higher profit and more powerful
computers that handle the world's e-mail and bank ATM transactions
and that feed data to multiple terminals in offices.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, Dell launched its line of workstations,
which are souped-up desktop computers used extensively by engineers
and financial analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert and Scacco said Dell's relationship with IBM will grow
in ways that help both companies. Scacco was asked about analysts'
expectations as well as the speculation that Dell would produce PCs
for IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing would surprise me,'' Scacco said.

ZEDILLO SUGGESTS U.S.-STYLE SYSTEM TO PICK PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL
NOMINEE
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico urged his
governing party on Thursday to break with 60 years of authoritarian
tradition and elect its presidential candidate this year through a
series of state primaries culminating in an American-style party
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's proposal to 1,800 government officials and party
leaders, which drew an extended standing ovation, was technically
only a recommendation. But officials of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, said there was little doubt
that the party would follow Zedillo's suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   The system he outlined would end the uniquely Mexican tradition
known as the dedazo _ literally, the ``fingering'' of candidates _
under which the 10 PRI presidents who preceded Zedillo all
hand-picked their own successors. But the president also said on
Thursday that he still intended to play a powerful role in the
party's candidate selection, leading several analysts to conclude
that the innovations he has in mind may be more of form than of
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo previously pledged in interviews that he would not
choose the PRI's candidate this year and had expressed admiration
for American-style primaries. But not until Thursday had he begun
to sketch out the procedures of the candidate-selection scheme he
wants the PRI to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reiterate today with absolute clarity that I will not
designate the PRI candidate,'' Zedillo said in a speech
commemorating the 70th anniversary of the party's founding in 1929.
``Our selection process should use the popular secret vote of our
active members and of all citizens who lean toward our party.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior aide to Zedillo said after the president's speech that
many elements of the candidate selection process under
consideration have been modeled on the U.S. model.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be very much the American way,'' the aide said. But
it is too soon to see how much the two systems might resemble each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's speech at party headquarters drew thunderous ovations
from the party's top leadership but also some grumbling, outside
the auditorium, from party gadflies who said his proposals were
less democratic than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Under the selection process Zedillo outlined, successive local
primaries would result in the election of delegates, who would meet
later with representatives of the PRI's labor, peasant and other
wings to select the presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   More than his predecessors, Zedillo is a democrat by conviction,
but his proposals appear motivated as much by tactical necessity as
by idealistic principles. The use of the dedazo has opened deep
party fissures before every election since the 1970s, as powerful
politicians passed over for the nomination have nursed their anger
in political feuds. A man spurned for the nomination in 1987,
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, defected from the PRI to form an
opposition party that is today the PRI's most dangerous rival.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, several analysts said, Zedillo believes that if the
party organizes primaries in which not only PRI members, but all
Mexican voters, are encouraged to participate, his own preferred
candidates will probably prevail over hard-line party
traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo drew sustained applause by criticizing several leaders
of the traditionalist wing, known as the dinosaurs, who have
already announced their own candidacies. He chided them for
threatening party unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comrades, besides democracy, we need unity, a lot of unity, to
win in 2000,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's address appeared to be Zedillo's most vigorous use to
date of his own influence to mold events within his party, from
which he once pledged to maintain a ``healthy distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, even as Zedillo voluntarily pledged to give up
the Mexican presidency's greatest power, the unilateral choice of a
successor, he vowed to use his powers in the PRI's internal
deliberations more forcefully than at any previous time. He is in
the fifth year of his six-year term and is ineligible to seek
re-election.

<P>
   ``I have every right and complete moral and political authority
to express my opinions about the process by which our party will
select its presidential candidate,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who use my pledge not to designate the candidate to say
that this in a process in which I won't get involved, in which I'll
be indifferent or standoffish, are mistaken,'' Zedillo said.
Hundreds of party leaders, apparently impatient with Zedillo's
previous hesitancy about directly involving himself in party
affairs, gave that line sustained applause.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Agustin Basave, a former PRI congressman who last year helped
found a caucus that has been pressing party leaders to allow the
rank and file to organize the candidate nomination process, said
Zedillo's proposals could give him tremendous power to influence
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president did today was smack his hand on the
table,'' Basave said. ``He said, `I'm the boss of the PRI and I'm
going to exercise my power in the party. I'll not designate the
candidate, but I'll set the rules and serve as referee. Well, the
line separating the referee from the guy who picks the candidate is
very thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Bartlett, a former interior minister who is a leader of
the PRI's dinosaur wing and has declared himself a candidate for
the nomination, praised the president's decision to end the dedazo
tradition. But he reserved final judgment on the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of details are still not spelled out,'' Bartlett said in
an interview. ``How and who will organize these state elections?
How will they count the votes? These are some of the things that
must still be defined, and party members should help set these
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Zarate, who edits a political newsletter here, said
Zedillo's speech ``makes it clear that the president intends to
keep tight control of the succession process.
</P>
<P>
   ``He laid out the party line in the orthodox way Mexican
presidents have been doing this for 60 years,'' Zarate said.
</P>
<P>
   A PRI official said party officials would circulate Zedillo's
proposals for internal debate in coming weeks before approving the
final candidate selection procedures in May. The PRI's top leader,
Mariano Palacios Alcocer, said in an interview this week that the
party will select its candidate by mid-November.

ALLEN WARDWELL, AUTHORITY ON PRIMITIVE ART, DIES AT 64  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Conn., Ill., Mass., Wash., Norway)   By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allen Wardwell, director of the Asia Society Galleries in New
York from 1974-84 and a prominent authority on primitive art of
many kinds, died on Monday while on vacation in Colorado. He was 64
and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Jan. 18, 1935, Wardwell was educated at Groton, Yale and
New York University. He was well placed to make a career in the
law. (His grandfather had founded the law firm of Davis, Polk and
Wardwell, in which his father was a partner.) But he decided to
follow his passion for fine art. In 1960, after receiving a
master's degree in art history at the Institute of Fine Arts in New
York University, where he was taught by Robert Goldwater, he became
head of the primitive art department at the Art Institute of
Chicago, a position he held until 1973. He was also acting director
of the institute's decorative arts department.
</P>
<P>
   His career took off in 1974, when he became director of the Asia
Society Galleries in New York. Robert B. Oxnam, formerly director
of the Asia Society, said Thursday that ``Allen Wardwell deeply
influenced American appreciation of non-Western arts and cultures,
especially in the enormously creative societies of the Asia-Pacific
region, Japan and the Native Americans of the Northwest Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Wardwell's enthusiasms included music and dancing. He was a
founder and active member of the Central Park Dance Skaters
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Asia Society in 1984, Wardwell was director of
the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum in New York from 1986 till 1990. To
the end of his life he was much in demand as a consultant to many
museums and institutions throughout the United States. He was
curatorial consultant for African and Oceanic art at the Museum of
Fine Arts in Boston and a senior consultant in American Indian art
and tribal art at Christie's auction house in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Among his many publications was an exemplary study, titled
``Tangible Visions,'' of Northwest Coast shamanic Indian art.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Sally Tilghman; a
daughter, Lelia, of Manhattan; two sons, William, of Seattle, and
Alexander, of Oslo; two sisters, Lelia Seidner of San Francisco and
Helen DuBois of Manhattan, and a grandchild.

 &HT;    Soft money is building a big cushion for Gingrich plans
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his newest incarnation, former House Speaker
Newt Gingrich is returning to an old model to help him raise large
amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   His political action committee, the Friends of Newt Gingrich
PAC, is accepting so-called soft money _ large and unregulated sums
from contributors that may not have to be disclosed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   FONG PAC, as it is known among Gingrich aides and supporters, is
telling prospective contributors it ``may accept unlimited
contributions from corporations or individuals,'' according to its
latest fund-raising letter.
</P>
<P>
   The contribution form includes spaces for donors to place a
check mark next to $50,000, $25,000, $10,000 or other.
</P>
<P>
   The solicitation of soft money harkens back to Gingrich's days
as the chairman of GOPAC, the Republican political organization he
used to build his stature and help dozens of future members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   GOPAC not only accepted soft money, it for years refused to
reveal the sources of its contributions. In Georgia, the State
Ethics Commission dismissed a complaint against GOPAC in 1995 that
sought to force the organization to disclose all its fund-raising
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's new PAC is based in Georgia, but he has a national
fund-raising base that is the envy of most politicians.
</P>
<P>
   While Gingrich has not revealed his future political plans _
speculation has ranged from a bid for Georgia governor in 2002 to a
presidential campaign in 2004 or 2008 _ an advocate of limiting the
role of money in politics offered a simple explanation for the
PAC's willingness to receive large contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to raise it because people are willing to give it
that way. The amounts are off the chart,'' said Bill Hogan of the
Center for Public Integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Several telephone calls to Gingrich's office in Georgia and to
his political adviser's office in Washington were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law places limits of $1,000 per election on
contributions to candidates for Congress and the presidency. PACs
that contribute to federal campaigns may accept $5,000 a year from
contributors and give $5,000 an election to candidates.
Corporations cannot make federal contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's PAC will have to abide by those limits for its
federal election activities. But it will maintain a separate
nonfederal account, which may be used to fund other political
activities, including travel, contributions to candidates on the
state and local levels and materials that present Gingrich's views.
</P>
<P>
   The distribution of political tapes to prospective office
holders, for example, was a key component of GOPAC's work in the
years leading up to Gingrich's rise to the speakership in January
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich announced that he was stepping down as speaker three
days after the November elections, in which Republicans
unexpectedly lost five seats in the House. He would have faced a
serious challenge to hold on to the speakership.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is accepting speaking engagements, reportedly for up to
$50,000 each, and he will form a consulting company. His supporters
have left no doubt that the former college professor will remain
active in politics.
</P>
<P>
   His political action committee will give him the means to do so.
Through the end of the year, the PAC had $275,000 in ready cash.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich will add substantially to that amount by mid-April when
his political supporters will hold a $1,000-a-plate ``Salute to
Newt'' gala in Washington. The April 14 event also will benefit one
of his favorite charities, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.
Actress Mary Tyler Moore, who chairs the Juvenile Diabetes
Foundation International, is scheduled to introduce Gingrich. And
actor John Ratzenberger, who played Cliff the mailman on TV's
``Cheers,'' will serve as master ceremonies, according to a memo
promoting the event.
</P>
<P>
   Former GOP colleagues who are now prominent lobbyists in
Washington are serving as co-chairmen.

EVAN THOMAS II, BOOK EDITOR AND PUBLISHING EXECUTIVE, DIES AT 78  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., N.J., D.C., Conn.)   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evan Welling Thomas II, a book editor who published dozens of
books, including John F. Kennedy's ``Profiles in Courage,'' died
Saturday at the Preston Health Center in Hilton Head, S.C. He was
78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from multiple sclerosis, said his
son, Evan Thomas III.
</P>
<P>
   An aggressive acquiring editor with a passion for sharply hewn
historical and political writing, Thomas rose through the ranks to
editor in chief at Harper &AMP; Bros., where he published several best
sellers, including ``Profiles in Courage,'' ``Death of a
President'' by William Manchester and ``The First Circle'' by
Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn.
</P>
<P>
   In a coup that drew a frenzy of publicity in 1967, Thomas
acquired the memoirs of Josef Stalin's daughter, Svetlana
Alliluyeva, who had defected to the United States. He paid Ms.
Alliluyeva an advance of more than $1 million, then a record sum.
</P>
<P>
   ``He treated publishing like journalism, and he wanted to get
the newsmakers into books as soon as possible,'' said his son, an
author and assistant managing editor at Newsweek magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was born on July 14, 1920, into a politically active
family. His father was Norman Thomas, who ran for president on the
Socialist Party ticket six times. Thomas grew up in Manhattan and
on Long Island and as a child counted among his sailing companions
John V. Lindsay, who later became the mayor of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas attended Princeton University, but a month before the
attack on Pearl Harbor he joined the American Field Service, a
group of Americans who served as ambulance drivers attached to the
British forces. In 1943, he was commissioned as an ensign in the
U.S. Navy and married Anne Robins in August.
</P>
<P>
   His war memoir, ``Ambulance in Africa,'' was published in 1945.
But his admiration for Maxwell Perkins, the editor of Thomas Wolfe,
F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, drew him toward a career
in book publishing. In 1945, he went to work as an editor at Harper
&AMP; Bros., which evolved into HarperCollins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Thomas joined W.W. Norton &AMP; Co. as executive editor,
where he acquired and edited dozens of notable books, including
``Thirteen Days: A Memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis'' by Robert
F. Kennedy, published after his death, and ``Eleanor and
Franklin,'' a National Book Award-winning biography of the
Roosevelts by Joseph P. Lash.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas retired from Norton in 1983. In addition to his son, who
lives in Washington, Thomas is survived by his wife, Anne D.R.
Thomas of Hilton Head; two sisters, Polly Miller of Cheshire,
Conn., and Frances Gates of Huntington, N.Y.; two daughters, Wendy
Zara of Sheldon, S.C., and Louisa Hargrave of Cutchogue, N.Y.; six
grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

BLACKMUN'S MAJORITY OPINION PLUNGED U.S. INTO STRUGGLE THAT
CONTINUES TODAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the very debate over abortion, people's reactions to the
death of retired Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun bend to the
extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the abortion rights movement are mourning him as an
unabashed hero _ the man who not only framed a woman's right to
abortion but also secured her right to control her destiny. Leaders
of groups opposed to abortion, however, describe Blackmun as the
man whose words became a death sentence for unborn children.
</P>
<P>
   In the narrowest light, his legacy was the landmark ruling he
authored in 1973 that legalized a woman's right to abortion in the
United States. But the court's decision, galvanized behind
Blackmun's majority opinion, also plunged the country into a
titanic political and moral struggle that continues today.
</P>
<P>
   It is a testament to the raw, emotional power of Roe vs. Wade
that Blackmun's words from the 26-year-old Supreme Court opinion
still characterize the nation's uneasiness over this most personal
of issues:
</P>
<P>
   ``We forthwith acknowledge our awareness of the sensitive and
emotional nature of the abortion controversy, of the vigorous
opposing views, even among physicians, and of the deep and
seemingly absolute convictions that the subject inspires,''
Blackmun wrote. ``One's philosophy, one's experiences, one's
exposures to the raw edges of human existence, one's religious
training, one's attitudes toward life and family and their values,
and the moral standards one establishes and seeks to observe, are
all likely to influence and to color one's thinking and conclusions
about abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our task, of course, is to resolve this issue by
constitutional measurement, free of emotion and of predilection,''
Blackmun wrote. But the subsequent change in law unleashed a
torrent of emotions and sparked the organization of groups who
opposed abortion so vehemently they were willing to take their
opposition to the sidewalks in front of abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in many mays responsible for the pro-life movement,''
said Bill Price, president of Texans United for Life. ``In our
books he was justice gone astray, part of the cabal of justices who
believed in legislating from the bench and just wiping away state's
abortion laws passed by the elected representatives of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``National Right to Life expresses our condolences to the family
of Justice Blackmun,'' said David O'Steen, executive director of
the National Right to Life Committee. However, he added, history
will remember Harry Blackmun as the architect of a tragic Supreme
Court decision, which ``has resulted in the deaths of 38 million
unborn children since 1973.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the abortion rights movement say Blackmun was a man
of courage who paid dearly for his judicial stance. Kate Michelman,
president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League, noted that he received massive amounts of hate mail and was
dogged by protesters at his office nearly every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He eventually began traveling with bodyguards and was even
shot at while in his own home,'' Michelman said, adding that the
bullet slammed into a chair his wife had just been sitting in. But
he never wavered in his belief that women should make their own
choice about abortion free from government interference, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important to acknowledge Justice Blackmun's
importance to women's historic struggle for equality and
emancipation,'' Michelman said. ``His contributions were, I think,
singular and monumental.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His legacy is broader than just legalizing abortion,'' said
Priscilla Smith, staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Law
and Policy. ``His legacy is also in establishing that women could
be equal participants in the economic life of the country as well
as the family life of the country.``
</P>
<P>
   ``The right to vote, which was a constitutional amendment, had I
think equal significance to women's struggle for equality,''
Michelman said. ``But in terms of women being able to really effect
control over their own destiny and how they would contribute to the
nation's life, Roe vs. Wade gave us that ultimate control.''

TRAINERS FACE TOO MUCH TRAFFIC ON WAY TO HALL OF FAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Trainers Richard Mandella and Neil Drysdale
have big chances in Saturday's Santa Anita Handicap, Mandella with
Puerto Madero and Event of the Year, Drysdale with Dr Fong.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they have almost no chance in the national racing
Hall of Fame voting under way this month among 130 writers,
broadcasters and thoroughbred historians.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't Drysdale's and Mandella's credentials. They
deserve enshrinement and with any luck they'll get it eventually.
The problem is that the other name on the ballot this year is D.
Wayne Lukas, the holder of just about every major training record,
and under the election rules only the top vote-getter makes the
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lukas has to be put in there,'' said none other than Drysdale.
``It would be a travesty if he's not.''
</P>
<P>
   If this were baseball _ whose Hall of Fame election format makes
sense to just about everyone but Pete Rose _ then Lukas, Mandella
and Drysdale all could be honored. Instead, it's tough luck for
those of us who would like to vote for all three.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it's tough luck for those of us who would like to vote
for !ital!none of the nominees in the jockey category _ Northern
California's Russell Baze, veteran Earlie Fires and the late Jackie
Westrope _ one of whom will be named a Hall of Famer sometime
during Kentucky Derby week.
</P>
<P>
   The way the voting goes now, your chances of making the Hall of
Fame depends on who else achieves the eligibility threshold _ 25
years as a trainer, 15 years as a jockey _ when you do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an awful big industry to only take one a year,'' Mandella
said. ``There's a lot of deserving people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandella, 48, trained 1993 Horse of the Year Kotashaan and won
six consecutive $1 million races from 1996 to '98, including Dare
and Go's upset of Cigar in the '96 Pacific Classic and the 1-2-3
sweeps in the '97 Big 'Cap and Hollywood Gold Cup. He'll win an
unprecedented third straight Santa Anita Handicap if he can beat
Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella said the Hall of Fame ``is not something I thought
about 25 years ago. I was just hoping to have some of those `M'
webbings (on his stalls) and be able to make a living training
horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale, 51, a well-traveled native of Surrey, England, trained
1992 Horse of the Year A.P. Indy, one of his five Breeders' Cup
winners. A.P. Indy is nominated in the ``contemporary male horses''
category with Exceller and Precisionist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read about (the nomination) in the paper and part of me
said, `It's an honor to be selected,' '' Drysdale said from his
Hollywood Park barn. ``The other part of me said, `Christ, I must
be getting old.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Either Drysdale, Mandella or Lukas will become the fifth Hall of
Fame trainer active in Southern California, joining Charlie
Whittingham, Jack Van Berg, Ron McAnally and Bobby Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems Lukas can lose only if it's a popularity contest.
He has clashed with reporters and vowed to boycott the Aug. 9 Hall
of Fame ceremonies in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., because the former
quarterhorse trainer believes he met the 25-year qualification
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Back to substance: A $1 million Big 'Cap victory would add to
the resumes of Mandella, who has won the race with Siphon and
Malek, and Drysdale, who hasn't won it.
</P>
<P>
   Malek wasn't entered Thursday. He'll go straight to the March 28
Dubai World Cup. But Chile-bred Puerto Madero, coming off a Donn
Handicap victory over Silver Charm, and 4-year-old Event of the
Year, the Strub Stakes winner, were the strength of the Mandella
team anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale's Dr Fong is fifth on the morning line at 10-1 in the
six-horse field. But the European import was underconditioned when
he ran second in his dirt-track debut in the Strub, should improve
at 1\ miles and looks like the right long shot.
</P>
<P>
   __ The undercard: Both sub-features on Big 'Cap day are
star-studded: The 7-furlong San Carlos Handicap finds Kona Gold
(120 pounds) trying to go gate to wire against Big Jag (118), Gold
Land (118), Lord Grillo and Dramatic Gold. The mile-on-turf Arcadia
Handicap pits Breeders' Cup Mile runner-up Hawksley Hill (122)
against Ladies Din (120) and five others.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Solis rides both highweights.
</P>
<P>
   The pick-six, for which Santa Anita is guaranteeing a pool of at
least $1 million, begins with the sixth of 11 races on a noon card.
</P>
<P>
   Big 'Cap coverage starts at 2 p.m. on Channel 11. The race is
the second in the ``NTRA Champions on Fox'' series.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quiet comeback: Out-of-town race of the week is Kentucky
Derby and Preakness winner Real Quiet's return to action in
Sunday's New Orleans Handicap at the Fair Grounds. He and Kent
Desormeaux will face a soft field in Real Quiet's first race since
his Belmont Stakes defeat in June.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet looked so sharp in a :58 1/5 workout at Santa Anita
on Tuesday, it's possible Baffert is running the wrong horse in the
Big 'Cap.
</P>
<P>
   __ The deepest field: A Blood-Horse magazine panel placed Man o'
War atop the 100 best thoroughbreds of the century. The rest of the
top 10: Secretariat, Citation, Kelso, Count Fleet, Dr. Fager,
Native Dancer, Forego, Seattle Slew and Spectacular Bid.
</P>
<P>
   Cigar (19th) is the highest-ranked horse who raced in the 1990s,
ahead of Sunday Silence (31st), Skip Away (32nd), Easy Goer (34th),
Silver Charm (63rd), Holy Bull (64th), Go for Wand (72nd), Lure
(85th) and Bayakoa (95th).
</P>
<P>
   Ruffian (35th) is the highest-ranked filly.

 &HT;    Carlos Museum meets funding goals for mummies
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Michael C. Carlos Museum of Art said Thursday it
has succeeded in raising the $2 million it needs to purchase a
cache of ancient Egyptian artifacts, including mummies and mummy
cases as much as 3,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The community responded so overwhelmingly since the Carlos
announced its quest last month that the Emory University museum
decided Feb. 11 to go ahead with a letter of intent, even though it
remained $275,000 short of its goal.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, additional support from the board and by an unnamed
foundation has enabled the Carlos to meet the price set by the
anonymous dealer for one of the last such collections in private
hands.
</P>
<P>
   But the fund-raising isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still seeking funds for conservation, installation and
publication,'' Carlos director Tony Hirschel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Carlos is waiting for official approval from the Canadian
government to take the collection out of the museum that houses it
in Niagara Falls, Ontario. It expects to hear something in a couple
of weeks. Hirschel said he hopes to ship the mummies to Atlanta in
May, and he promised to keep the community posted about when to
expect to see them.

ITALY OUTRAGED AT ACQUITTAL OF U.S. PILOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: See also MARINE-AVIATOR)  
(rk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Italians reacted with shock and outrage Thursday night to
the acquittal of an American pilot who, in their view, recklessly
sheared the cables of an Italian ski lift, causing the death of 20
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, who was giving a speech at the
John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, said he was baffled by the
acquittal of the pilot, Capt. Richard J. Ashby. D'Alema, who is in
the United States to hold his first official meeting with President
Clinton, said he would bring up the verdict on Friday when he was
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It leaves us very worried because that was an incident where
we expected that justice would be done,'' D'Alema said.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, other politicians and ordinary Italians were far less
constrained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am outraged and indignant at this verdict which takes no
account of Italy's ban on low-level flights,'' said Valdo Spini,
the chairman of the defense committee of the lower house of
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Spini added with sarcasm, ``At this point we will end up blaming
the skiers who were on that wretched cable car.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the victims expressed shock at the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a disgraceful verdict,'' said Klaus Stampfl, an Italian
from Bressanone, whose mother died in the accident. ``During the
hearings that took place in Trento I gave a letter to an American
prosecutor in which I asked that justice be done. I think, at this
point, that my preoccupations were founded.''
</P>
<P>
   Stampfl said he followed the case in the United States and was
horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I felt that they were almost having fun during the
hearings,'' he said. ``Certainly, it was not a serious trial like
it could have been had it taken place in Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``At this point the 20 victims have no value. No one
is guilty of the tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict revived Italian calls for a trial in Italy. It also
revived political animosities between the United States and Italy
that have mostly been dormant over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the heated emotions spilling over at home, D'Alema
sought a rational approach, suggesting that Italy might try to find
other legal avenues, like a civil lawsuit or a prosecution of
senior officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to understand whether this verdict means canceling
every responsibility or whether the military judges felt that the
responsibilities lie elsewhere,'' he said Thursday night. ``This is
a problem that is difficult to judge right now because we don't
have the verdict, but certainly in these hours we are busy trying
to better understand to see which roads can be taken to obtain
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, which occurred at the resort town of Mount
Cermis last February, Italian criminal investigators had fought to
have the plane's crew tried in Italy, and they were supported by
many ordinary Italians, who feared that the American justice system
would not deal as severely with American servicemen.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Italian government recognized the U.S. right to prosecute
its own servicemen, part of a bilateral agreement within the NATO
charter. Some politicians said Thursday that those agreements
should be re-examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because if in cases like this, the right of each nation to try
its own military leads to results of this kind, obviously, these
rules must be re-examined,'' Spini said.
</P>
<P>
   Italian prosecutors in Trento said the acquittal vindicated
their earlier demand for an Italian trial. Thursday night, Bruno
Giardina, one of the investigators who followed the case, said that
he was not surprised by the verdict and that an earlier decision by
an American military court to exempt some higher-ranking Marine
officers made him realize that there might be no finding of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Many other Italians had long been lobbying for a trial in Italy,
and Thursday they expressed a sense of vindication.
</P>
<P>
   Beppe Contrelli, a lawyer with the February 3 Committee for
Justice, an organization that sought an Italian trial, said: ``It
is a disgraceful verdict. Let it be a lesson for those who expected
justice, rapidity and severity from American justice. Twenty
useless victims have been condemned to a death without justice, as
we had foreseen for months. That is why the committee had long
fought to hold the trial in Italy. In retrospect, I must say that I
was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Italian politicians viewed the verdict as an indictment of
the American system of justice. Mauro Piassan, head of the Greens,
a left-wing environmentalist party, called the decision ``a
scandalous verdict that offends those 20 dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Injustice has been done,'' Piassan said. ``The homicidal
behavior of the American military has been rewarded. They played
war, they killed 20 people and they were let off. Those 20 victims
were offended, and their dear ones have been deceived.''

WORM, A SHY GUY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ There might not be enough words in Webster's
to fully describe Dennis Rodman. Colorful. Strange. Talented.
Controversial. Genius.
</P>
<P>
   But SHY?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, yes. The same guy who's made a reputation of
outrageousness off the court is a wallflower in the locker room. In
his first week with the Lakers, Rodman has said little to teammates
once the final buzzer sounds. Lauded as a communicator and leader
on the court, he's seldom heard off it.
</P>
<P>
   On the team bus and plane, he sits with his two bodyguards.
Before and after games, he usually dresses away from the locker. He
still refers to the team as ``they,'' not ``we.'' The guy who sits
next to him in the Forum locker room hasn't had a conversation with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' said Travis Knight. ``He's there when it counts,
I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   And Knight's description of the multitattooed, multipierced,
multicolor-haired Rodman might be the most unique of all. ``He's a
regular guy,'' Knight said with a straight face. ``He may not be
like you or me, but he's still a regular guy. He's quiet. Maybe
he's got a lot on his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's fine with the Lakers, so long as Rodman plays like
the seven-time rebounding champion he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all that matters,'' Kobe Bryant said. ``He could come
in here right now and not say a word to anybody, but on the
basketball court, you feel his impact.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for camaraderie?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's overrated,'' Bryant said. ``If you have guys that are
friends off the court and you win a championship, that's perfect,
but in the NBA you rarely see that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Something Olden: Last time the Lakers saw Olden Polynice, the
Seattle center was neutralizing Shaquille O'Neal, dancing and
fist-pumping in celebration, then following up with observations
about how the Lakers huddle is one big, profanity-laced screaming
match.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics are in town tonight and the Lakers haven't forgotten
the loss _ or Polynice's antics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of got embarrassed,'' Eddie Jones said. ``We also got
talked about, so I think the motivation is they embarrassed us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every individual is really feeling what their players said and
the way the guy was dancing,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the finger-pointing and dancing, that's just not the way
to play this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Polynice's critique, Jones said, ``Olden's gonna say
whatever; Olden wants to be in L.A. so bad. He may not say much
here, though. He may not dance on the court here in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Added O'Neal, who watched Polynice get 17 rebounds and 15
points, ``I'm the bridge, Olden is water, which means no matter
what he does, no matter how high his tide rises, he'll always be
under me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Parting shot: Jones, who long ago tired of trade talk
involving him and Charlotte's Glen Rice, has acquired a healthy
sense of humor about it. For the last two days, he's ended
interviews with reporters by shaking everyone's hand, smiling and
saying, ``Guys, it's been nice.''

 &HT;    Grading the reading skills of Georgia's students
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The latest evidence of weak reading skills among
Georgia's children, from what is called the nation's report card,
didn't surprise elementary school teacher Rebecca Pruitt.
</P>
<P>
   When she began nine years ago out of Georgia Southern University
with a degree in elementary education, she had not been taught how
to teach reading. Now a literacy teacher at Conley Hills Elementary
in East Point, she has what few elementary teachers get in college
_ a systematic reading program to offer children. For eight years
in first- and second-grade classrooms, ``I basically followed a
textbook and what was in the curriculum, and what my county said I
should follow, but I didn't really understand how I could teach a
child to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Scores released Thursday from the National Assessment of
Educational Progress show that reading problems are not confined to
a small segment of poor or disabled students, but cut across the
mainstream of children from the cities to the suburbs, locally and
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say it is too soon to see results of a growing
emphasis that Georgia, like many other states, has been putting on
reading. ``I think it's akin to a tanker given the command to make
a right turn,'' said Jim Puckett, head of the Georgia Association
of Educational Leaders, which represents school administrators.
``It takes a while for that ship to actually make the turn.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the latest NAEP scores confirm the need for change,
the change that is coming slowly to Georgia may be just as spotty
and unfocused as the old ways.
</P>
<P>
   The official state curriculum was revised in 1997 to put more
emphasis on phonics, but objectives for what students should learn
in reading in first and second grade are a hodgepodge of old
concepts that come from various schools of thought and opinion. For
example, students are expected to figure out words from their
context, memorize increasing numbers of words, and use rhymes and
initial consonants to sound out parts of words.
</P>
<P>
   Reading experts say this is not a balanced approach, but a
chaotic one that ignores research on reading. Laura Fredrick, an
assistant professor of educational psychology at Georgia State
University who has instituted a well-researched reading program at
two Georgia schools, wondered why the state doesn't simply adopt
reading strategies that have scientific data behind them.
</P>
<P>
   She said one problem may be the tendency of her fellow education
professors to ignore research data, ``unless it's think-pieces we
happen to agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she's not happy with the state curriculum having bits
and pieces of various theories, it was a result of a committee of
hundreds of people from universities, schools and the public
putting it together, said state school Superintendent Linda
Schrenko.
</P>
<P>
   Even the state Department of Education's two reading programs,
Reading First and Reading Challenge, span a wide range of programs
and methods, generally mixing phonics, or teaching letter-sound
correspondence, with lots of reading of children's literature.
Results from the first year of the program are not yet available.
</P>
<P>
   Keisha Shivers, 9, happens to be in a Reading Challenge
after-school program in Cobb County that uses a program called
Sing, Spell, Read, Write, which includes music to reinforce the
rules of sounding out words.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Jean Word, said she hopes phonics works for her
daughter, because her own reading instruction left her to figure
out words by memorizing them or looking for clues from the
sentence. With that method, ``you don't have a way to break them
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Board of Regents now requires elementary education
students to take more reading classes, it won't help to take more
of the same courses, said Peggy Torrey, head of the Professional
Standards Commission, which certifies teachers and colleges of
education.
</P>
<P>
   Pruitt, the literacy teacher, agreed. Her undergraduate courses
in reading consisted of activities and units of study, but ``no one
really sat me down and said, `This is how you teach reading.

 CEO Pushes Out of PointCast  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
PointCast Inc., the once high-flying Internet pioneer that has
experienced turbulence for more than a year, yesterday announced
the resignation of CEO David Dorman, who disclosed that the company
is seeking a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Dorman, 45, yesterday was appointed chief executive of a new $10
billion joint venture between AT&AMP;T Corp. and British
Telecommunications PLC's. He said he will step down as PointCast
CEO and remain chairman until a buyout or merger agreement is
completed in several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ```PointCast is near the goal line. We expect to have a deal
done,'' Dorman said.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Koen, PointCast's new president and CEO, said Dorman's
comments about a pending sale was ``news to me.'' Koen said
PointCast was in the midst of negotiations for a strategic
partnership. ``We're intent on getting a deal done soon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   PointCast was the original purveyor of ``push'' technology,
which collected news and information from the Internet and
delivered it directly to computer users for free. But the
technology quickly fell out of favor with some consumers and
businesses, who griped that their Net connections were bogged down
by the onslaught of data.
</P>
<P>
   Dorman was recruited from SBC Communications in late 1997 to
reverse PointCast's flagging fortunes and take it public within six
to 12 months. But his 16-month legacy was spotty, according to his
detractors. During his reign, the company scrapped plans for an
initial public offering and labored to find a buyer or strategic
partner. On top of that, its subscriber base declined to 1.1
million from 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the Sunnyvale company unsuccessfully sought a
business partner for more than six months and that recent
negotiations with several Baby Bells to provide high-speed Internet
access were beginning to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   At the AT&AMP;T-British Telecommunications subsidiary, Dorman will
oversee international operations for large, multinational
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said Dorman's substantial experience in the telephone
industry and at a startup &UR;  &LR; are assets. However, his lack of an
international business background is a ``question mark,'' said
Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of POINTCAS () &QL;

QUEBEC'S ORPHANS WHO WEREN'T RECALL CARE THAT WASN'T 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy)   By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Down by the St. Lawrence River, in the parish hall
behind the somber stone church of St. Peter the Apostle, Herve
Bertrand and other French Canadian Catholics gathered recently to
condemn the church that has so thoroughly shaped most aspects of
life in the province of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any problem with their God,'' Bertrand said.
``But I've got big problems with the people who made the decision
that did this to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertrand is now a 56-year-old plumber from a Montreal suburb
with a wife and three grown children. He is one of about 3,000
French Canadians known as the ``Duplessis orphans'' because they
were institutionalized in the 1940s and '50s when Maurice Duplessis
was the iron-willed premier of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 of the orphans have formed a committee and are
demanding an apology and restitution from the Catholic Church and
the Quebec government for the way they were treated, and some say
physically and sexually abused, when they were unjustifiably placed
in mental institutions as children. Bertrand says employees at the
institution where he was kept for eight years sexually assaulted
him more than 30 times, the last in an elevator while he was in a
straitjacket.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ``Duplessis orphans'' were not orphans at all. Like
Bertrand, they had been born out of wedlock at a time when
conservative Catholic sentiments made it wise to keep such
transgressions secret. Many illegitimate children were raised in
orphanages run by Roman Catholic nuns.
</P>
<P>
   The Duplessis government worked hand in hand with the Catholic
Church. When federal money became available for health care, but
not education, the government encouraged the religious order to
transform their orphanages into mental institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply, it was more profitable for the Quebec government
and the church to warehouse psychiatric patients than to take care
of normal children, so they struck a dirty deal,'' said Rodrigue
Vienneau, whose wife, Clarina Duguay, had been declared mentally
incompetent and kept in a church-run institution after her mother
became sick and her father, a woodsman, was unable to care for his
five children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 11, they falsified my medical records and
classified me as mentally deficient,'' Mrs. Duguay said. Like many
women in Quebec, she kept her maiden name after she married. ``All
around me there were real mental patients. They gave me plenty of
pills, and I was sexually abused by the sisters who, at bath time,
used to wash my breasts and then told me I could wash my back
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Gaudreau, a psychologist at the University of Montreal who
visited one of the orphanages in 1961, said there is little doubt
that children were unnecessarily institutionalized during that
time. Tests conducted then showed, he said, that mental
deficiencies were often caused by lack of stimulation, not mental
illness.
</P>
<P>
   While unable to prove any specific charges of abuse, a
government ombudsman in 1997 documented the existence of as many as
3,000 Duplessis orphans. Without determining who was at fault, the
ombudsman recommended that they be compensated.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Lucien Bouchard, the premier of Quebec, offered the
orphans an apology, along with compensation worth the equivalent of
about $2 million (U.S.). But the committee rejected the offer,
which comes to about $670 for each orphan, and insisted on a full
public inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   As they fight for recognition and justice, the orphans are
reminding other Quebecers of the enormous changes that have taken
place in the province since the 1940s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Quebec has undergone is a major cultural trauma,'' said
J. Robert Choquette, a professor of Canadian religious history at
the University of Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   The changes set off by Pope John XXIII in the early 1960s
touched Catholics around the world, but few places felt it as
deeply as Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church's dominance in Quebec was sweeping,'' Choquette
said.
</P>
<P>
   A map of Quebec reflects that. From the names of rivers, to the
names of many towns and villages, Quebec and the Catholic Church
were inseparable. At its apogee in the 1940s, the church ran all
schools, hospitals and social institutions, like the orphanages,
with the direct consent of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Duplessis' death in 1959 coincided with an awakening of social
awareness that ushered in enormous changes for religion and society
and set off a conflict between tradition and modernism. ``What the
conflict produced is the classic definition of throwing out the
baby with the bath water,'' Choquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the small churches and grand cathedrals that once
overflowed with the faithful on Sundays are sparsely attended.
Quebec's birth rate has dropped from one of the world's highest to
one of the lowest, in part because the use of contraceptives is now
widely accepted and abortion is legal.
</P>
<P>
   The province has gone from having one of the lowest rates of
divorce _ prohibited by the Catholic Church _ to one of the
highest. It has one of the lowest rates of marriage in Canada, and
53 percent of its children are born out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the church's presence is virtually inescapable, so much
so that when the orphans denounced the church, they did so in
rented space at a parish community center.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, some of the orphans, wearing straitjackets of
the type they say were used on them as children, demonstrated in
front of the Montreal offices of the head of the church in Quebec,
Jean-Claude Cardinal Turcotte. They demanded an apology, a public
inquiry and compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal refused to meet the orphans, but he did say he did
not believe that the nuns who ran the institutions, often under
very difficult conditions, had systematically abused their
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they watch television and hear protesters claim they beat
children, that is upsetting,'' he told a local reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of issuing an apology, he challenged the ``orphans'' to
prove they were abused.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Bertrand thought he was doing when he showed
reporters medical records detailing injuries he said he suffered in
the sexual assaults. That is why Mrs. Duguay produced her childhood
medical records, which said that she was mentally deficient, even
though she had no previous or subsequent history of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dugay and her husband say that, while they live surrounded
by the Catholic Church and its trappings, they do not attend
services regularly anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family was very religious,'' Vienneau said. ``There are two
nuns on my mother's side, and I was an altar boy for four years.''
But the church that once brought him peace now only raises his ire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would only go back to practicing and go back to what we
learned as young children,'' he said, ``the day that the church
will apologize for what they've done.''

 Men's Wearhouse Buys Chain To Better Suit Its Business  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Men's Wearhouse said yesterday that it will more than double its
business in very low-end suits by acquiring K&AMP;G Men's Center Inc.
of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The all-stock deal, valued between $121 million and $133
million, will merge K&AMP;G's 33 superstores into the 20-unit Value
Priced Clothing division of Men's Wearhouse of Fremont. Both
operations are so-called weekend warriors _ they are open Fridays
through Sundays and sell suits for $99 to $199.
</P>
<P>
   Men's Wearhouse's VPC division is separate from its 411 Men's
Wearhouse specialty stores, which sell better-quality suits for
$199 to $699 and are open all week.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will boost Men's Wearhouse's market share in
men's tailored apparel to between 11 and 12 percent from the
current 9 percent, said Kelly Armstrong, an analyst at First Union
Capital Markets.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong forecasts $171 million in sales for K&AMP;G in 1999,
compared with $61 million for the VPC division. The transaction is
expected to be finalized by July.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said she expects the deal to add to Men's Wearhouse's
earnings this year. With more stores, the company should be able to
strike better deals in advertising and sourcing, she added. The
company already is the largest in its category in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The deal adds 13 new states to Men's Wearhouse's VPC division.
K&AMP;G and VPC both have stores in Los Angeles, Texas and Atlanta. VPC
operates SuitMax stores in those markets and in New Orleans, as
well as Suit Warehouse stores in Detroit. K&AMP;G's other markets are
Colorado, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New
Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Seattle and
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Men's Wearhouse is giving K&AMP;G shareholders between 4.1 million
and 4.4 million shares, depending on their trading price prior to
closure of the deal. Each K&AMP;G share will be converted to between
0.4 and 0.43 of a share of Men's Wearhouse stock.
</P>
<P>
   Separately yesterday, Men's Wearhouse said February sales rose
12.5 percent to $53.4 million while sales at mature stores grew 2.7
percent. Revenues last year totaled $768 million.

 Column: When a New Job Is a Step Down  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  My company just eliminated my job as part of a
budget-cutting initiative and offered me a new position elsewhere
in the firm. The company claims this is a lateral move. But this
new job really carries less professional status and responsibility,
and is not something I would ever have applied for on my own. If I
decline to take this job, can I negotiate a severance package? What
kind of package should I seek?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Frankly, you're not in a real strong negotiating
position.
</P>
<P>
   Companies typically offer severance packages when people are
being laid off. But your firm isn't laying you off: It's offering
you another position that, while not as good as your old one, is
still a job.
</P>
<P>
   You should start by taking a hard look at this new job and
whether it really is as bad as you think. There may be an upside
that you're not seeing _ a chance to learn new skills, branch out
in a new career direction or solve some intractable business
problems that will make you a star at the company.
</P>
<P>
   But let's assume the job would genuinely be a step down and you
don't want to spend one day doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at what kinds of severance, if any, the company has
given to other employees in your situation. Also, do an honest
assessment of your reputation at the company: They may be more
willing to help you if you've worked there for a long time or have
been an outstanding contributor.
</P>
<P>
   Then go to your boss and explain that this new position won't
challenge you or help you meet your career goals. Ask if the
company could help you make the transition to a new job by:
</P>
<P>
   _Continuing your salary for 90 days while you job hunt. (This is
a real longshot.)
</P>
<P>
   _Continue your health benefits for 90 days or until you find a
new job.
</P>
<P>
   _Pay for five or six sessions with a career coach or counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Will the company do any of this? It's hard to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really depends on the company,'' said Charles Prugh, a San
Francisco career counselor and outplacement expert. ``Some may help
this person out. Others won't and will say, `You're out of here on
Friday.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Overload
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a business with one employee, an office manager who is
paid $28,000. I don't pay her overtime since I consider her an
exempt employee. But I've been told this may be open to challenge
since she cannot possibly handle the office's growing workload in
40 hours and so must work weekends, evenings, etc. Am I on shaky
ground here?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: I'd say you're on pretty shaky ground, not just legally
but &UR;  &LR; managerially.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of WORKWAYS () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The legal issue is whether this employee can really be considered
exempt from overtime. She wouldn't qualify for a managerial
exemption, since she doesn't supervise any other employees. She
might qualify for an administrative exemption, but that would
depend on how much independence and authority she's allowed in her
job.
</P>
<P>
   California law says that exempt administrative employees must
work under general supervision rather than close supervision.
</P>
<P>
   They must also spend more than 50 percent of their time on tasks
involving the exercise of ``discretion and independent judgment in
the performance of intellectual work.''
</P>
<P>
   That means if this office manager spends most of her time on
routine clerical tasks like typing and answering phones, she
wouldn't qualify. But if she spends more than half her time on
things like drafting a budget or searching for new office space,
she might qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's only one person in the office, I'd suspect she's
doing a lot of clerical duties,'' said Larry Shapiro, editor of the
California Employer Advisor newsletter in Tiburon. ``And if more
than 50 percent of her time is spent on clerical duties, that could
be a (legal) problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet is to talk to an employment lawyer about the
specifics of her job and whether she is correctly classified as
exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I'd take a hard look at her workload _ even if she is
truly exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Working nights and weekends on a regular basis is a lot to ask
from someone who's paid just $28,000 a year. You run a serious risk
of burning her out and losing her. You also run a risk that work
won't get done as well as it should, and important tasks may fall
through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   It may be time to bite the bullet and pay for a second employee
to help handle your growing workload.
</P>
<P>
   Stress in the '90s
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just moved and found a job that pays well but involves me
wearing two different hats. The stress has me questioning the job's
worth. On top of that, the company is being taken over by a very
large firm with a mixed reputation. The money is good, but I'm way
stressed out. What should I do?
</P>
<P>
   A: A new job, a heavy workload and a corporate takeover ... you
could hardly write a better recipe for 1990s stress if you tried.
</P>
<P>
   Try talking with your boss about ways to restructure your job so
it's less stressful. If that doesn't work, you need to assess how
deeply the pressure is affecting your life.
</P>
<P>
   If it's something you can tolerate, it might be worth holding on
for a while to see if things improve under the new owners.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of WORKWAYS () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  If you're finding yourself depressed, sleepless or chronically
irritable with family and friends, it may be time to move on. Good
pay isn't worth the loss of your health or your relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Don't simply up and quit, though: It will be easier to find new
work if you're currently employed. And simply knowing that you're
looking for an exit may improve your spirits.
</P>
<P>

Send your work and career questions to Ilana DeBare, Workways, San
Francisco Chronicle, 901 Mission St., San Francisco 94103. Or send
e-mail to workways(at sign)sfgate.com. &LR;   &LR; Or call (415) 764-2815. We

YELTSIN CALLS FOR TYCOON'S OUSTER FROM DIPLOMATIC POST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin demanded on Thursday night that
Boris Berezovsky be ousted from a prominent diplomatic post,
climaxing a power struggle that has roiled the capital.
</P>
<P>
   One of Russia's best-known and most cocksure tycoons, Berezovsky
has been serving as the chief executive of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, a largely ineffectual organization of 12 former
Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, who was traveling in Azerbaijan on Commonwealth
business, said Thursday that he would not stay in his post if a
single leader turned against him.
</P>
<P>
   But few expect his near-certain dismissal to end the infighting
in Moscow. With Yeltsin ailing and presidential elections scheduled
for next year, political maneuvering has become the main
preoccupation of Russia's leaders these days, not overhauling the
nation's economy, which remains mired in depression.
</P>
<P>
   Positioning himself to succeed Yeltsin, Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov launched a broad effort to consolidate his power. He waged
a strong campaign against Berezovsky, who is unpopular with the
public because of his image as an unscrupulous wheeler-dealer who
has had a Rasputin-like influence over the Yeltsin family.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky's companies were raided by federal agents in black
ski masks. Conversations he taped between himself and Yeltsin's
daughter were seized and then leaked to the Russian press, a move
that succeeded in hurting his relations with the Yeltsin family.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov even issued a not-so-veiled threat to throw Berezovsky
in jail. Or as the prime minister put it, 94,000 prisoners would be
set free to make room in the jails for an incoming wave of corrupt
businessmen and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   But Berezovsky had refused to yield.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old financier and veteran intriguer held a news
conference on Monday in which he insisted he was the victim of a
dark conspiracy. He cast the Primakov government as a throwback to
the Soviet past and demanded that the Communist Party be banned.
And Nezavisimaya Gazeta, the newspaper Berezovsky controls, has
alleged that Primakov's team is riddled with corruption, pointing
particularly to the first deputy prime minister, Yuri Maslyukov, a
Communist.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin spokesmen said that Yeltsin was seeking Berezovsky's
dismissal because the businessman had exceeded his authority.
Technically, however, Yeltsin lacks the power to fire Berezovsky.
That authority is reserved for the commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky has his admirers. Aides to Georgian President Eduard
A. Shevardnadze and Ukraine's president, Leonid Kuchma, criticized
Yeltsin's decision, saying he failed to consult with his fellow
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin's opposition makes Berezovsky's dismissal virtually
a foregone conclusion. Berezovsky, for his part, said he would
attend a coming meeting of the Commonwealth but would not stay if
any president was against him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Berezovsky has been hired and fired before. The businessman made
a fortune through his Logovaz car dealerships and later acquired
large stakes in oil, television, banking and airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Russia's other so-called oligarchs, Berezovsky helped
finance Yeltsin's re-election in 1996. He was rewarded by being
named deputy secretary of the national security council.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky was later ousted from that job only to be appointed
to his current position at the commonwealth. Since then he has
backed a range of candidates including former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Alexander Lebed, the former general who is now
governor of Krasnoyarsk.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's move against Berezovsky marked a dizzying comedown for
a man who helped organize the publication of Yeltsin's memoirs and
is said to have advised Yeltsin family members on their personal
finances.
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, unlikely to end the political squabbling. And
Berezovsky may not be the only victim.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has been rife with rumors that Maslyukov and other senior
aides may be fired. A Communist who once served as head of the
central planning minister during Soviet times, Maslyukov has been a
target for critics, who say he has failed to win support from the
International Monetary Fund or hammer out an effective economic
plan,
</P>
<P>
   As rumors of a political shake-up have spread, Yeltsin's
spokesmen have even felt compelled to issue denials that Primakov
will be fired.

 IBM Selling Dell $16 Billion in Computer Parts  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The old guard and the young stud of the computing industry are
getting pretty chummy.
</P>
<P>
   In a blockbuster alliance announced yesterday, IBM will sell an
estimated $16 billion worth of computer parts to Dell Computer
during the next seven years. The companies also will jointly
develop new technology, which Dell could put in its products and
IBM could sell to other customers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal _ believed to be the largest such agreement _
guarantees hefty new revenues to IBM, the world's biggest
information technology company.
</P>
<P>
   And it could aid Dell in its quest to surpass Compaq as the
world's No. 1 maker of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's stock jumped $4.25 to $171 as investors concluded that
it's a sweet deal for Big Blue. But Dell's shares rose just 94
cents to $81.88, reflecting concern that it may take more than a
high-profile alliance to reverse a recent slowdown in the company's
revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's stock was trading as high as $108 early last month. But
it got hammered after the Round Rock, Texas, company reported a
less-than-expected 38 percent increase in sales for the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, which pioneered direct sales of PCs, had been growing at a
50 percent-plus clip. It has been hurt by increasing competition
from Compaq and others. In addition, prices for corporate PCs _
Dell's main market _ are expected to slide this year, just as they
have in the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell is striving to pass Compaq in the worldwide market, and
in order to meet that goal, they need to make some major strategy
adjustments,'' said Martin Goslar, director of PC market research
for Chaners In-Stat Group.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance with IBM _ which spends more than $5 billion a year
on research _ could lead to new products that give Dell a leg up in
the market for PCs, network servers and computer storage systems _
all areas in which it goes up against Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   For IBM of Armonk, N.Y., the alliance furthers chief executive
Louis Gerstner's goal to make sales of technology to other
companies a main engine of growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement is a recognition of the value of IBM's
technology leadership in the marketplace,'' said James Vanderslice,
who runs the company's Technology Group. ``It's also further
evidence of our commitment to bring IBM-developed technology to
market quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Dell will buy high-capacity disk drives, flat-panel
displays and network cards from IBM, along with memory and custom
chips. The agreement also calls for Dell to have access to future
products such as copper-based chips that run much faster than
today's chips, which use aluminum to connect millions of
transistors.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said it might use IBM processors in some of its models _ a
move that would be a blow to Intel, which now supplies all of the
main chips for Dell computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microprocessors are among the areas where IBM has a good deal
of capability,'' said Dell spokesman T.R. Reid. ``If we can bring
that technology to bear in products for the benefit of customers,
we will do it.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM spokesman Tom Beermann said, however, that as far as he
knows, there are no plans to include processors in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM-Dell arrangement also could put pressure on Compaq,
which competes against IBM in large-scale computers and against
Dell in PCs. Compaq has been trying to emulate both companies
lately, embracing the direct-sales concept of Dell while offering
services similar to those that have helped IBM grow rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's stock fell 56 cents to $33.31 yesterday.

 Management Fads Have Helped Improve Performance at U.S. Companies  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Sun Microsystems' microelectronics division was having problems
with its ability to handle customers' problems.
</P>
<P>
   When corporate buyers asked Sun to test a nonworking microchip
or motherboard, they'd often have to wait six months for a
diagnosis. Sometimes, Sun misplaced the product and the customer
wouldn't get an answer at all.
</P>
<P>
   So Sun set up a 15-member interdepartmental team to improve its
failure-analysis process. Now _ just more than a year later _ Sun's
customers can get a preliminary diagnosis of their problem within
six days and a final fix within 24 days.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of success story has become increasingly common in
American business during the past 20 years, according to Robert
Cole, a business professor at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the credit, Cole says, should go to management
trends such as quality circles, total quality management and
re-engineering _ fads that typically evoke more ridicule or
cynicism than respect.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Dilbert' (the comic strip) has done very well by these fads,
and clearly, some were implemented quite badly by companies,'' said
Cole, author of a new book, ``Managing Quality Fads: How American
Business Learned to Play the Quality Game'' (Oxford University
Press, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   ``But across the broad range of manufacturing industries,
quality has substantially improved since the early 1980s,'' Cole
said. ``And some combination of these factors is responsible for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole's book charts the history of quality fads in America from
the late 1970s, when companies first became alarmed by competition
from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '60s and '70s, American cars all had clocks, but the
clocks never worked and no one ever thought twice about it,'' Cole
said. ``Then the Japanese arrived on the scene, and their clocks
worked. ... A lot of the quality movement has been about closing
the gap with Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   The earliest efforts to close the quality gap with Japan
consisted of what Cole calls ``quality by exhortation.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of QUALITY0 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Executives felt that if they could simply inspire their workers
to do a better job, they would get better products.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our quality problems were the result of bad work
systems, but the initial reaction was to blame workers and
unions,'' Cole said. ``Then came a lot of different gurus with
conflicting advice, so there was a tremendous confusion about which
way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies jumped on a series of quality-related bandwagons that
included:
</P>
<P>
   _Quality circles, in which small teams of workers were formed to
tackle manufacturing problems.
</P>
<P>
   _Statistical process control, the use of statistical methods to
analyze and improve business processes.
</P>
<P>
   _Continuous improvement, a theory based on the Japanese concept
of kaizen, which said that companies could reap big gains in
productivity through a series of incremental process improvements
over time.
</P>
<P>
   _TQM, a catchall term referring to a variety of
quality-improvement practices.
</P>
<P>
   _Benchmarking, where companies compared their business processes
with top-performing firms in their own or other industries.
</P>
<P>
   _Re-engineering, which applied the idea of process improvement
to large corporate functions like order processing, sometimes
overhauling an entire segment of a company.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies zigged and zagged from one quality initiative to
another, leaving employees disoriented and cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the quality efforts in the United States failed
because they were `programs du jour,''' said Jim Lynch, director of
corporate quality at Sun Microsystems in Palo Alto. ``Or people
confused process management with real tangible results. What's the
point of making sure that a process is `defect-free' if it's a
process that doesn't matter to your customers?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other companies quietly took lessons from each fad
and built them into a coherent whole.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of QUALITY0 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``Our story is a story of continuity, not fads,'' said Richard
LeVitt, director of quality at Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto. ``As
new things come along, we incorporate them. It's not so much
replacing one idea with another as adding that new idea.''
</P>
<P>
   How has the changing parade of quality fads affected today's
workplaces?
</P>
<P>
   Cole says that one legacy is the understanding within all kinds
of companies _ not just within manufacturing firms _ of the
importance of work processes and systems.
</P>
<P>
   Few managers today believe that they can solve problems simply
by exhorting employees to work harder. Instead, they try to look at
how to improve their business processes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People understood the concept of process in manufacturing in
the early 1980s, but applying it to administration or design would
have been a stretch,'' Cole said. ``Today, people see things like
product design as a process, not just as the result of a
collaboration of brilliant individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Another legacy is the continued use of employee teams, either on
a regular basis or to solve specific problems, like the
failure-analysis team at Sun.
</P>
<P>
   A third legacy is the common focus today on customer service _
even in industries that traditionally didn't have a service focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thrust of the quality movement was to focus
managers' attention on customers _ anticipating customers' needs
and meeting those needs,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   At Sun Microsystems, executives have made a conscious effort to
stay away from quality fads and buzzwords.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate about TQM being good or bad is a waste of time,''
Lynch said. ``We've deliberately avoided the debate around the term
TQM. There's no need to waste your management time on these
debates.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sun's homegrown solutions to quality improvement still have
roots in some of those management fads.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Sun CEO Scott McNealy invited a series of other CEOs to
brief his executive staff on their firms' quality initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of QUALITY0 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  One guest was the CEO of Motorola, who talked about his company's
use of employee teams _ a descendant of the old ``quality circles''
fad.
</P>
<P>
   Sun set up its own ``SunTeam'' program. Now, the company has
about 300 teams _ with some 4,000 employees from both rank-and-file
jobs and management _ working on specific ways to improve
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Kunesh is the quality engineer who was tapped to head a
team focused on the failure-analysis problems in Sun's
microelectronics division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were losing customers' parts _ and let me tell you, that
was really embarrassing,'' Kunesh recounted. ``Parts were coming in
at the front desk and being placed in engineers' chairs or left
with the receptionist. It wasn't working.''
</P>
<P>
   The team included customer service representatives, engineers,
even people who worked on the loading dock. They studied the
system, interviewed customers and came up with some new ways of
doing things.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Kunesh's team suggested letting customers talk
directly with an engineer when things weren't working right _
rather than going through a nontechnical intermediary. They set up
a matrix for tracking where parts were sent, who was handling them
and how long each step was taking. And they added a
customer-feedback page to every diagnostic report provided by the
division.
</P>
<P>
   The result? A dramatic decrease in diagnostic time _ down from
six months to less than one month.
</P>
<P>
   Kunesh credits his team's work with helping boost one big
client's quarterly order from $3 million to $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   And whether it's called TQM or something less trendy, he said,
the process worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be successful with the basics _ communications,
customer service, having respect for your fellow employees,''
Kunesh said. ``TQM may be a fad word. But no matter what you call
it, if you're doing those basics, you'll be successful.''

 &HT;    NCR chairman's bonus boosted to $665,704
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Lars Nyberg, chairman and chief executive of NCR
Corp., saw his bonus for 1998 climb 414 percent to $665,704,
boosting his total compensation for the year to $2.25 million,
according to the company's latest proxy statement.
</P>
<P>
   Nyberg's compensation last year included $991,888 in salary,
$665,704 in bonus and $602,328 in other pay and stock options,
according to the proxy, filed Thursday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Nyberg's bonus in 1997 _ a difficult year for the Dayton-based
computer equipment and services company _ was $129,500. In 1996,
his bonus was $772,915. His base salary has jumped 53 percent over
the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, 1999 looks even better for Nyberg. He
stands to collect $5.8 million in cash bonuses on top of his usual
salary and bonus. If he is still with the company in September, he
will receive 149,533 shares of NCR stock worth about $6.3 million,
plus be eligible to purchase another 149,533 shares at $33.44 a
share. NCR stock closed Thursday at $41.37 per share.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 stock option and grant and cash bonuses are part of an
agreement Nyberg and NCR reached three years ago. The deal calls
for Nyberg to receive $3.87 million if he is still with NCR as of
June 1 and another $2 million if he signs on for another two years
at the helm. Nyberg, 47, has said he expects to continue leading
company. He has been its top executive since June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, executive compensation is tied to performance at
large corporations. NCR languished in 1997, but made a dramatic
turnaround last year, boosting earnings 1,642 percent to $122
million, or $1.20 per share, compared with $7 million, or 7 cents
per share, for all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   NCR is also planning an unusual move to consolidate the number
of stockholders, according to the proxy statement. NCR will ask
shareholders at its April 15 annual meeting to approve a plan to
purchase shares from 628,000 people who own fewer than 10 NCR
shares. The move is expected to save $2.5 million a year in
administrative and mailing costs.

 Microsoft Tentacles Reaching Out Again  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Microsoft Corp. yesterday unveiled a wide-ranging plan that could
make it even more omnipresent in the business world, even as a
prominent trade group suggested the government should look at
breaking up the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive Bill Gates told a group of about 200 analysts
and reporters in San Francisco that Microsoft's new electronic
commerce strategy would provide products and services touching
every aspect of doing business on the Internet. The plan includes
helping companies set up Internet retail sites, setting common
standards for electronic transactions, and tracking sales patterns
and consumer habits.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's e-commerce plan revolves around a new product named
BizTalk, which is both a common computer language and a related
Internet server program that would allow companies using different
software to perform transactions more seamlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said he hopes to help 1 million businesses set up
storefronts on the Web in the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the Internet will become the marketplace for most
businesses,'' Gates said. ``BizTalk is the glue that ties all that
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that although Microsoft so far has lagged in the
growing electronic commerce field, the company is now launching a
full-court press against rivals like database software-maker Oracle
Corp. and the Internet alliance of America Online and Netscape
Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Microsoft hopes to extend the reach of its
already dominant Windows programs and Internet server software,
which would be tailored to use BizTalk.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is also working on a new BizTalk Server, a program for
corporate Internet servers, due out in a test version in July.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also plans to set up a one-stop marketplace on the
Web, called Open Marketplace, with a service called Microsoft
Passport to provide consumers with a universal way to shop and buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised by the extent of their articulated land
grab,'' said analyst Bill Burnham of Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MICROSOF () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Tim Bajarin, president of the San Jose research firm Creative
Strategies Inc., said Microsoft's Open Marketplace could become the
online Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes Microsoft a threat to Amazon.com right off the
bat,'' Bajarin said.
</P>
<P>
   Also yesterday, Microsoft said it purchased CompareNet, a
privately held San Francisco company that provides an Internet
comparison shopping service, for an undisclosed purchase price.
CompareNet will soon be incorporated into Microsoft's MSN Sidewalk
online guide.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is teaming with PeopleSoft of Pleasanton to develop
Internet tools for businesses, and announced an alliance with
MasterCard International and Clarus Corp. to market an
``integrated'' method for companies to purchase goods and services
from one another over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft made the announcements just as reports surfaced 3,000
miles away that the biggest software trade association had
suggested the government should consider breaking up Microsoft if
the company loses its landmark antitrust case with the U.S. Justice
Department and 19 states.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,400-member Washington-based Software and Information
Industry Association made its recommendations in a secret report
sent to Justice Department lawyers. The report proposed splitting
Microsoft into three so-called ``Baby Bills'' that would focus on
separate markets: the Windows operating system, software
applications, and Internet content and tools.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is one of the biggest companies in the trade group,
which is partially a successor to the Software Publishers
Association. The group's board _ which issued the report over
Microsoft's strong objection _ includes executives from Netscape,
Oracle and IBM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question at the e-commerce press conference,
Microsoft Chief Operating Officer Bob Herbold downplayed the
report's significance. He said the leak of the breakup proposal
``was unfortunate'' and that the opinion was ``counter to the
membership of that organization.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of MICROSOF () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said discussion of remedies the
government may seek was ``premature'' since the antitrust trial has
not concluded. He called the breakup proposal ``little more than
wishful thinking'' by Microsoft's competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust case has been unfolding in a federal courtroom in
Washington since October. Microsoft completed its defense last week
and the trial is on a six-week hiatus before the next phase, when
each side will call rebuttal witnesses. During the break, Microsoft
is scheduling meetings at a handful of newspapers around the
country to respond to stories that the company bungled its defense
in the case.

REPUBLICAN LEADERS IN CONGRESS AGREE ON BROAD BUDGET PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican leaders of Congress agreed Thursday
on the broad outlines of a budget plan that they said would
immediately wall off Social Security funds so they could not be
used to pay for tax cuts or new government spending.
</P>
<P>
   The budget framework for fiscal year 2,000, hammered out in days
of closed-door meetings among senior House and Senate Republicans,
would adhere to the stringent spending limits enacted in the
balanced-budget agreement reached between President Clinton and
Congress two years ago. And it would provide for a relatively small
tax cut in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, growing into a tax cut
of as much as $800 billion over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have a package that is historic,'' said Rep. John
Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee. ``For
the first time we are making the argument that government should
not take any of the money that comes in for our senior citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The outline represents the Republicans' effort to avoid the
feuding and disarray of last year and to set the stage for a battle
with Clinton over fiscal policy in an age of windfall surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is intended to protect Republicans from charges by
Clinton and Democrats that they would use Social Security money to
finance tax cuts for the wealthy. In fact Republicans hope that
their plan will prove an impediment to Democrats, leaving them open
to accusations that they are raiding Social Security if they want
to increase domestic spending.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan will force Republicans to give up hopes that they
could enact a large tax cut before the 2000 election year. While
numbers were still being assembled, Republicans said the tax cut in
the 2000 fiscal year would be about $10 billion to $15 billion. And
the outline will require the House and Senate Republicans to make
billions of dollars in spending cuts to stay within the budget
limits set in 1997. That will not be an easy task, particularly in
the House where Republicans hold a scant six-seat majority.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich and Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the
Senate Budget Committee, acknowledged that they still had to sell
the blueprint to their rank and file. Some moderates could oppose
the cuts in domestic spending the plan would necessitate. The two
men hope to report th budget plan out of their committes later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Thursday night signaled that simply setting
aside Social Security money would not be enough to satisfy Clinton.
``Their plan is still nearly $700 billion short for Medicare,''
said Gene Sperling, the senior White House economic adviser. ``And
its not clear whether they extend the life of Social Security a
single day or how they could put together a budget that would not
lead to significant reductions in areas like education, environment
and health care.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans countered that they were actually doing more to
safeguard Social Security than Clinton. Domenici cited a study by
the Congressional BUdget Office that said the president's budget
would save only 58 percent of next year's Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's running around saying he's the one saving Social
Security,'' Domenici said. ``If saving the trust fund and not
spending it is the test, we're 100 percent pure, and he's 58
percent pure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican agreement on Thursday came as the party's
congressional leaders made a determined effort to avoid the
mistakes of last year when Clinton first proposed that surpluses be
set aside to ensure the solvency of the Social Security trust fund
for the baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   His stand left Republicans divided over whether to save the
surplus or enact large tax cuts. The House and Senate never enacted
an agreed-upon budget plan. The result was that Clinton won
increases in education spending and other domestic spending in a
last-minute spending bill just before the election. Republicans
lost any leverage because they were afraid of being accused once
again of provoking a shut down in the government.
</P>
<P>
   For years money brought into the government through Social
Security taxes had been used to mask the true size of the federal
deficit and to pay for spending programs unrelated to retirement.
In the 2000 fiscal year, for example, the Congressional Budget
Office has projected a surplus of $133 billion. But if Social
Security funds are subtracted, the government still has a deficit
of $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The move to wall off Social Security funds immediately was
promoted by Domenici, who wanted to blunt any charges by Democrats
that Republicans were raiding the popular federal retirement
program. Under the plan the Social Security surplus _ expected to
reach 1.8 trillion over the next decade _ can be used for debt
reduction or else for an eventual Social Security overhaul. To
spend the surpluses any other way would require 60 votes in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was initially resisted by Kasich who had wanted to
phase in such a plan over several years in order to be able to dip
into the surplus for a little bit longer. That would have made it
easier for Republicans to craft a large tax cut as the centerpiece
of an election year agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said that Kasich was ultimately pleased with the
decision to stay within the budget limits set in the balanced
budget law, despite pressure for more spending. And he took
satisfaction in the Senate's agreement to a phased-in tax cut.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said their plan would also live within next year's
spending limit of about $550 billion for discretionary spending in
domestic and military programs. And they said they would accomplish
this while also raising military spending. Even if programs are
frozen at this year's levels, Congress will still have to make
savings of about $15 billion because of inflation. And that is
before increases in military and education spending, which are
desired by both parties, are taken into account. Such increases
would require offsetting spending cuts in other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich and Domenici did not say what kind of tax cut the
Republicans will enact and the budget resolution is usually silent
on that question, leaving it up to Congress' tax writing committees
to decide that later in the year. Republicans are deeply divided
over whether to pursue an across-the board 10 percent tax cut,
whether to enact tax credits for certain social purposes, or
whether to pursue other tax reductions, such as a cut in the
so-called marriage penalty which results in married couples
sometimes paying more in taxes than if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   One option that might make it easier for Republicans to stay
within the budget caps, several Republicans said, would be for them
to enact a tax cut, such as a reduction in the capital gains tax,
which could initially bring in more government revenue by spurring
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich, who is running for the Republican presidential
nomination, said he is still committed to the sweeping 10 percent
tax reduction. He joked he would find a way to include a subliminal
message in the budget plan in favor of that kind of tax cut.
``But,'' he admitted, ``who knows how it's going to come out.''

INSPECTOR REMOVED, TWICE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   As a farm kid in Pennsylvania, Mary Rose Diefenderfer dreamed of
soaring in the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   But today Diefenderfer, a former commercial pilot and aviation
safety inspector, has seen her dreams grounded by the bloody
politics of airline regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration managers in Seattle have twice
removed her from her job policing Alaska Airlines. Each time, she
was transferred after investigating Alaska for violating pilot
training or certification rules.
</P>
<P>
   The first time, in 1993, she won back her job. Now she's stuck
in a desk job, answering questions for safety inspectors who are
doing what she wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the FAA's 3,000 safety inspectors nationwide, she
is a zealot for following rules because she knows why the rules are
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the nightmares that most inspectors have _ the smoking,
charred hole in the ground, twisted metal, body bags filled with
unrecognizable corpses, the loved ones grieving,'' she said. ``This
is what it's all about. This is what we're supposed to prevent.
This is our job.''
</P>
<P>
   Her current job ``is like dying a slow death. I want to be out
there on the line again,'' she said. ``I have so much to contribute
to aviation safety, and now I'm stuck doing busy work.''
</P>
<P>
   Her last chance rests with a pending lawsuit, and with breaking
the FAA's bureaucratic code of silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really kept hoping that the FAA would realize that there are
some valid safety concerns out there, that its inspectors were
doing their jobs properly,'' she said. ``But it has become
political, too much of appeasing the carrier at all cost. I don't
think the FAA will change until the public and Congress make it
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Diefenderfer learned about FAA politics on the job as the
agency's principal operations inspector at Alaska Airlines between
1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   She and her three-member team focused on the way Alaska ran the
airline, trained its pilots and, in large part, how those pilots
flew. She said the job required a firm hand to tame a ``bush pilot
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had what I considered to be a frontier mentality: `Do
what you want, get the job done and worry about the consequences
later.'''
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the airline's newsletter lauded a resourceful pilot
who discovered that a Siberian airport lacked de-icing fluid and
used a more plentiful ice melter on his plane's wings. It had to
caution pilots against the practice after the FAA pointed out that
vodka isn't an approved substitute and is quite flammable.
</P>
<P>
   The job became difficult when she confronted Alaska employees
about bending, ignoring and breaking rules. It became impossible
when her bosses backed the airline over her and her team of
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   When she was removed from her job, Diefenderfer and her
inspectors were finishing an investigation of improper pilot
testing and alleged falsification of records. Her team recommended
a big fine.
</P>
<P>
   But Diefenderfer's bosses rejected that suggestion. Instead, one
of her supervisors wrote an apologetic letter to the airline in
April.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the FAA transferred her.
</P>
<P>
   She was reinstated two months later, after she filed a
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The tension grew as Diefenderfer and the airline clashed over
safety at Juneau International Airport. The capital city airport is
a pilot's nightmare: mountains on three sides, a runway parallel to
a fjord and frequent high winds. Congress ordered a study of the
airport in 1992 after a National Guard plane crashed in the Chilkat
Mountains there, killing eight.
</P>
<P>
   That 1996 report singled out an FAA-approved eastward departure
as a particular problem. It requires pilots to take off into a box
canyon, veer toward a mountain, then turn more than 180 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In a Seattle flight simulator, Diefenderfer watched Alaska
pilots try to make the departure with one engine out. Invariably,
they would smack into the simulated mountain. She restricted the
use of that departure for several months in 1996, forcing Alaska to
cancel 25 percent to 30 percent of all flights out of Juneau.
</P>
<P>
   Her stand was unpopular, but new methods and technology have
since been adopted to increase the margin of safety in Juneau.
</P>
<P>
   The action that may have ended Diefenderfer's career as Alaska's
principal operations inspector began with an unusual flight taken
by one of her inspectors in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   According to an FAA report, the inspector went along with an
Alaska instructor pilot and a new captain taking a proficiency test
that pilots call a ``check ride.'' The new captain made errors and
should have failed the test, but the instructor recorded no score
and said he would continue training _ violating FAA requirements
that all check rides must be recorded. Diefenderfer's inspectors
later found the practice was routine at Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, Alaska executives complained to Marlene Livack,
who had recently become manager of the Seattle district office and
one of Diefenderfer's bosses. They told Livack their relationship
with the FAA's inspection team had deteriorated, and mentioned
Diefenderfer by name.
</P>
<P>
   Livack called ``facilitated meetings'' to improve the
relationship, but Diefenderfer saw them as ``meetings on how to get
rid of the problem _ and `the problem' was me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The constant conflicts in trying to get these safety issues
resolved took its toll,'' she said. ``There were months of
sleepless nights. I'd lie awake wondering if I pushed too hard or
didn't push hard enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, her bosses pushed her out. They accused her of not
being a team player _ of being abrasive, hostile in meetings and of
ignoring the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   Diefenderfer had written a memo two years earlier saying that
her immediate supervisor, Phil Hoy, should be kept out of
enforcement matters. Alaska, she wrote, needs to be told that Phil
is ``the administrative supervisor. All technical issues need to go
to the principals (inspectors).''
</P>
<P>
   In another e-mail she told Hoy she was the ``technical
supervisor of this section'' and that she had the ``background that
you don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   And she had gone over the heads of all her supervisors by
sending a letter to Alaska Chief Executive Officer John Kelly,
asking about the status of her relationship with the airline and
pointing out problems with Alaska personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote the letter because I felt there were severe safety
issues that he didn't know about. It's his airline. He's got to
care,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her bosses didn't like the surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Diefenderfer was barred from any further contact with Alaska,
and was told not to take any records or even brief her successor.
In January, an arbitrator ruled that FAA management had
``legitimate business reasons'' for her reassignment, partly due to
her impolitic actions.
</P>
<P>
   Two years have passed since Diefenderfer's battle with Alaska.
Her lawsuit to win reinstatement is on appeal, but she has grown
discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   She kept the same pay and rank when she was transferred, but her
desk job often leaves her with nothing to do for days at a time.
She says she stays on in hopes of clearing her name, but it may be
a lost cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the FAA, but in reality, I know that I don't have
future with the agency,'' she said.``Was it worth all the grief? I
believe (the inspectors) probably saved some lives with our effort.
So, sure, it was worth it.''

LET US FIGHT THE REAL ENEMIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (New York Times OpEd for release Friday, March 5)  
 By SALMAN RUSHDIE  
 c.1998 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A couple of years ago a British literary festival
staged a public debate on the motion that ``it is the duty of every
European to resist American culture.'' Along with two American
journalists (one of whom was Sidney Blumenthal, now more famous as
a Clinton aide and impeachment witness), I opposed the motion. I'm
happy to report that we won, capturing roughly 60 percent of the
audience's vote.
</P>
<P>
   But it was an odd sort of victory. My American co-panelists were
surprised by the strength of the audience's anti-Americanism _
after all, 40 percent of the crowd had voted for the motion.
Sidney, noting that ``American culture'' as represented by American
armed forces had liberated Europe from Nazism not all that many
years ago, was puzzled by the audience's apparent lack of
gratitude. And there was a residual feeling that the case for
``resistance'' was actually pretty strong.
</P>
<P>
   Since that day, the debate about cultural globalization and its
military-political sidekick, intervention, has continued to
intensify, and anti-American sentiment is, if anything, on the
increase. In most people's heads, globalization has come to mean
the worldwide triumph of Nike, the Gap and MTV. Confusingly, we
want these goods and services when we behave as consumers, but with
our cultural hats on we have begun to deplore their omnipresence.
</P>
<P>
   On the merits of intervention, even greater confusion reigns. We
don't seem to know if we want a world policeman or not. If the
``international community,'' which these days is little more than a
euphemism for the United States, fails to intervene promptly in
Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, it is excoriated for that failure.
Elsewhere, it is criticized just as vehemently when it does
intervene: when American bombs fall on Iraq, or when American
agents assist in the capture of the Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, those of us who shelter under the pax Americana are
deeply ambiguous about it, and the United States will no doubt
continue to be surprised by the level of the world's ingratitude.
The globalizing power of American culture is opposed by an
improbable alliance that includes everyone from cultural-relativist
liberals to hard-line fundamentalists, with all manner of
pluralists and individualists, to say nothing of flag-waving
nationalists and splintering sectarians, in between.
</P>
<P>
   Much ecological concern is presently being expressed about the
crisis in biodiversity, the possibility that a fifth or more of the
earth's species of living forms may soon become extinct. To some,
globalization is an equivalent social catastrophe, with equally
alarming implications for the survival of true cultural diversity,
of the world's precious localness: the Indianness of India, the
Frenchness of France.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this din of global defensiveness, little thought is given
to some of the most important questions raised by a phenomenon
that, like it or not, isn't going away any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   For instance: Do cultures actually exist as separate, pure,
defensible entities? Is not melange, adulteration, impurity,
pick'n'mix at the heart of the idea of the modern, and hasn't it
been that way for most of this all-shook-up century? Doesn't the
idea of pure cultures, in urgent need of being kept free from alien
contamination, lead us inexorably toward apartheid, toward ethnic
cleansing, toward the gas chamber?
</P>
<P>
   Or, to put it another way: Are there other universals besides
international conglomerates and the interests of superpowers? And
if by chance there were a universal value that might, for the sake
of argument, be called ``freedom,'' whose enemies _ tyranny,
bigotry, intolerance, fanaticism _ were the enemies of us all; and
if this ``freedom'' were discovered to exist in greater quantity in
the countries of the West than anywhere else on earth; and if, in
the world as it actually exists, rather than in some unattainable
Utopia, the authority of the United States were the best current
guarantor of that ``freedom,'' then might it not follow that to
oppose the spread of American culture would be to take up arms
against the wrong foe?
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing on what we are against, we discover what we are for.
Andre Malraux believed that the third millennium must be the age of
religion. I would say rather that it must be the age in which we
finally grow out of our need for religion. But to cease to believe
in our gods is not the same thing as commencing to believe in
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   There are fundamental freedoms to fight for, and it will not do
to doom the terrorized women of Afghanistan or of the
circumcision-happy lands of Africa by calling their oppression
their ``culture.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course it is America's duty not to abuse its
pre-eminence, and it is our right to criticize such abuses when
they happen _ when, for example, innocent factories in Sudan are
bombed, or Iraqi civilians pointlessly killed.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps we, too, need to rethink our easy condemnations.
Sneakers, burgers, blue jeans and music videos aren't the enemy. If
the young people of Iran now insist on rock concerts, who are we to
criticize their cultural contamination? Out there are real tyrants
to defeat. Let's keep our eyes on the prize.

LEWINSKY INTERVIEW DREW INTEREST OF VIEWERS  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN With STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans were sick and tired of Monica Lewinsky,
and even Barbara Walters would not offer enough incentive to watch
more, some people said. Others said Ms. Lewinsky's face and voice
would be magnetic. The fascination theorists were right.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters' interview on Wednesday night attracted an average
of 48.5 million viewers, and an estimated 70 million people watched
all or part of the two-hour program, in about 33.2 million homes (a
33.4 Nielsen rating). Of the television sets in use in those two
hours, 48 percent were tuned to ABC, an exceptionally high number
for a news program, and high for any broadcast television event in
this multichannel age.
</P>
<P>
   Although far more people watched the last Super Bowl (an average
of 83.7 million) or Academy Awards show (87 million), or even last
May's final episode of the sitcom ``Seinfeld'' (76.3 million), no
single network news program has ever been watched by as many
people.
</P>
<P>
   And no such news program, it is believed, has ever pulled in as
much money for a network. Advertising industry executives estimated
that ABC made $20 million to $25 million in commercials sold for
the hours between 9 and 11 p.m. that night, at least three times
its normal revenue for those hours on a Wednesday. The precise
figure cannot be calculated because advertisers negotiated assorted
deals for this expanded edition of ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC News, which said it did not pay Ms. Lewinsky for the
interview, certainly did a comprehensive job of promoting it,
which, in turn, helped kick off sales of Ms. Lewinsky's book,
``Monica's Story,'' published Thursday by St. Martin's Press.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman, John Murphy, said Thursday that the
publishing house was preparing to print 400,000 more books to fill
back orders, in addition to the initial run of 400,000 copies. It
remains to be seen whether the book can maintain the momentum of
the initial rush.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Joe Lockhart, President Clinton's press
secretary, said the president did not watch the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ABC did all it could to generate interest in the program, which
had added importance to the network because it appeared on the
final night of a ``sweeps'' month when Nielsen ratings are used to
set advertising rates for the next quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The day of the interview, Ms. Walters talked about it on ``Good
Morning America,'' ``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee,'' ``The View''
(a late-morning talk show of which she is a co-host with three
other women) and ``World News Tonight.'' Afterward, she was a guest
on ABC News' ``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real information age media event, with pre-game and
post-game commentary, instant replay and instant polls,'' Diane
Sawyer, the co-host of ABC News' ``Good Morning America,'' said
shortly after 7 a.m. Thursday, as ABC picked up the ball again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Morning America'' devoted most of its two hours to the
interview _ replaying highlights, showing polls and viewers'
e-mail, and interviewing experts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two hours of Ms. Lewinsky might be too much, some television
industry experts thought. But the Nielsen ratings increased in each
of the first three half-hours, and declined only between 10:30 and
11 p.m. Sets in use declined then, too.
</P>
<P>
   For the February sweeps period, Ms. Walters' interview propelled
ABC into a tie for second place, with Fox, among 18-to-49-year-old
viewers, the group that advertisers pay the most to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Because this ``20/20'' was a ``special'' (at two hours), ABC
could ask advertisers for a higher price, and did: $800,000 per
30-second commercial. But industry sources said very few paid that
price (five times the normal rate for ``20/20''), and most will end
up paying $300,000 to $500,000 per spot.

 &HT;    Woman who aided '94 GOP House takeover signs on to Bush's
exploratory committee
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The woman who helped mastermind the 1994
Republican takeover of the U.S. House has signed on to help direct
Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Bush confirmed Thursday that Maria Cino, former
executive director of the National Republican Congressional
Committee, will take a top staff job in the campaign, now in the
preliminary fund-raising stage.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Cino's hiring comes as Bush prepares for a Sunday
announcement of the members of the exploratory committee that will
quickly rev up to full-speed fund-raising. Former Secretary of
State George Shultz, who has been consulting with Bush, is expected
to be a committee member.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Bush's big weekend will begin with fund-raising efforts
for President Bill Clinton's hometown congressman. Bush is the
featured speaker at the Dallas event for U.S. Rep. Jay Dickey
(R-Arkansas).
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Bush will drop by the University Interscholastic
League girls basketball tournament and then head to Houston for a
Saturday night speech to congregants at Second Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   After a Sunday morning speech at the same church, Bush will
return to Austin to introduce members of his exploratory committee
at an Austin Convention Center news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members, such as Cino, will not be introduced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cino, now affiliated with the Washington law and lobbying firm
of Wiley, Rein &AMP; Fielding, served as executive director of the
National Republican Congressional Committee from 1993-1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to her resume, she was ``responsible for managing two
historic (U.S.) House Republican victories.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the GOP took control of the House for the first time in
40 years. In 1996, the party retained the majority for the first
time in 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   Her current firm has lobbied on behalf of a long list of
clients, including Eastman Kodak, United Airlines, United Parcel
Service, Dallas-based A.H. Belo Corp. (owner of the Dallas Morning
News), Gannett Company (owner of several newspapers) and the
Newspaper Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Cino's clients have included United Airlines and the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Fielding, a senior partner at the firm, served as counsel
to President Ronald Reagan from 1981-1986. He served as deputy
counsel to President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   At NRCC, Cino's boss was then-U.S. Rep. Bill Paxon of New York,
was was the committee chairman. From 1989-1992, Cino was chief of
staff for Paxon.
</P>
<P>
   In a reminder that political circles are sometimes tight ones,
Paxon is married to former U.S. Rep. Susan Molinari. Former U.S.
Rep. Guy Molinari, Susan's father, is coordinator of the Draft Bush
2000 Committee that has won the support of 76 current members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Among those is Dickey, a four-term House member whose district
includes Hope and Hot Springs, the cities in which Clinton was
raised.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, as the Senate impeachment trial churned toward
acquittal of Clinton, The New York Times reported that Dickey was
among several House members targeted for defeat by the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought his story was a compelling story,'' Bush said of
Dickey. ``He is from President Clinton's home state and had been
threatened politically for making a tough decision so I thought I'd
try to help him as much as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aides denied there was a political hit list.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey, who had remained undecided for several weeks prior to
the House impeachment vote, wound up voting for two of the four
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey, noting that Bush is about the hottest political property
in the nation, said Thursday, ``The timing of this event is
certainly fortuitous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My supporters are looking forward to hearing from Governor
Bush,'' he said.

``20 Dates.'' By bending the rules to send up the conventions of

RED SOX, FISK DISCUSS A JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ For close to five years, Dan Duquette has
courted Carlton Fisk about taking a job with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Vermont-born, New Hampshire-bred,
one-day-Hall-of-Fame-bound catcher indicated that he is close to
saying yes to the team with which he began his much-decorated
career, but left under acrimonious circumstances. Apparently he is
prepared to embrace the team as his own again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're serious,'' Fisk, 51, said as Duquette escorted him
through the Sox clubhouse Thursday morning. ``There's been some
contact over the years, and now it's coming to a head.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said the nature of the job is still under discussion.
``Maybe he'll be on-field with players, maybe he'll do some
coaching, maybe he'll be a special assistant to the general
manager,'' said the GM, smiling broadly.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant's job would appear to be the most likely scenario
for Fisk, allowing him the flexibility to spend some time in
uniform while also keeping a hand in front-office matters,
including player evaluation and personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams, who visited with Fisk while hitting
ground balls on a back field, played against Fisk when both were in
the minor leagues. That was in 1971, when Fisk was with Triple A
Louisville and Williams was with Tidewater. The following season,
Fisk was the unanimous choice as American League Rookie of the
Year, setting off a 22-year career during which he set the major
league record for games caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think so,'' Williams said when asked if hiring Fisk
would be a positive for the ball club. ``Him being a Red Sock for
so many years, the things he did in Boston, you people know better
than I do. Say his name, it's synonymous with the Red Sox. Even
though he played for the White Sox, this is where it's still.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be real good for the organization to bring
back somebody who played as long as he did. They still show shots
of his (1975 World Series) home run, to say the least a dramatic
home run, and they'll be showing that for a long time from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette and club CEO John Harrington first met with Fisk in
1994, Duquette's first year with the team, and a year after Fisk's
career came to a bitter end, at age 45, when the White Sox released
him.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Fisk was assisting in the coaching of his son
Casey's team at Illinois State. But otherwise Fisk stayed away from
the game. There was no going back to the White Sox, not after he'd
openly warred with club owner Jerry Reinsdorf. And there had yet to
be a healing of the rupture with the Red Sox, which dated back to
1980, when amid a bitter contract dispute, Haywood Sullivan failed
to mail Fisk's contract in time, making him a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   But there were signs of a thaw in September 1997, when Fisk was
inducted into the Red Sox Hall of Fame and honored at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you grow, you mature in life,'' Fisk said on that
occasion. ``I think every guy, kid, athlete who has grown up in New
England fantasizes about playing for the Boston Red Sox in Fenway
Park, wearing the Red Sox uniform, and I was fortunate enough to
realize that fairy tale. A lot of fairy tales have been told and in
every one of them, there's a scary part, an unpleasant part, but
they all culminate with happy endings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may not be a happy ending. Maybe it's a happy
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk, who has a home in Sarasota, about 90 minutes from the Sox
facility, figures to be an on-field presence in spring training if
he takes a job with the club. The Red Sox, with young catchers
Scott Hatteberg and Jason Varitek, would welcome his wisdom,
especially coming from a chiseled specimen who looks as if he could
still strap on a chest protector, if it weren't for the five knee
operations and three hand operations he endured.
</P>
<P>
   What has he been doing with himself? ``Golfing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, someone suggested, he could be Duquette's media
liaison. ``Yeah, right, you know the way I got along with you
guys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the title, veteran Tim Wakefield said Fisk belongs
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he even told me (about a possible job), I said to him,
`I'd love to see you in uniform again,' '' Wakefield said. ``To
have somebody of that caliber, that stature, helping young guys,
just talking to him would be a great asset to our club.''

DEMOCRAT PLANS FOR CONVENTION IN LA HIT A SNAG

<P>
   BOSTON _ Don't print the LA 2000 T-shirts and buttons yet. Los
Angeles' bid to host the Democratic National Convention next year
has run into ``difficulty,'' according to sources close to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point is a familiar one: Republican Mayor Richard
Riordan does not want to be liable for raising $35 million to host
the convention, sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan has urged the DNC to sign a contract with the
businessmen spearheading the city's bid _ billionaire Eli Broad,
entertainment industry mogul David Geffen, and Los Angeles lawyer
William Wardlaw. But the DNC has always signed its convention
contract with a government executive, not a group of private
citizens, according to several people familiar with the process.
</P>
<P>
   The snags in LA's bid persist two weeks after Boston Mayor
Thomas M. Menino unexpectedly announced that Los Angeles was
negotiating a formal contract that spelled a sure end to Boston's
first quest to land the nomination party for August 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Menino's announcement preempted a party announcement about the
LA negotiations, surprising members of the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday a DNC spokeswoman said the negotiations are continuing
with Los Angeles, but declined to discuss any details.
</P>
<P>
   Menino made his DNC remarks on the same day he learned that the
US Department of Housing and Urban Development had issued charges
against the city for failing to protect minority residents of
public housing from harassment before 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While some local observers wondered if there was any tie between
the two events, Washington sources said it did not appear that
Menino's statements raised much ire in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   But in Denver Thursday, there was some sentiment that Boston had
dropped off the convention radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been given an indication by folks in Washington that if
LA doesn't work out, they would stay in the West,'' said Mike Dino,
who has headed Denver's bid for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Dino said Mayor Wellington Webb has been too busy preparing for
his reelection bid in May to think about the Democratic convention
the past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dino said if LA or Denver had been able to muster the private-
and public-sector support that Boston had for its convention bid,
the contract would have been signed with LA or Denver months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's bid included an $8 million pledge from the city and
another $8 million from the state as well as pledges from the
business community to round out a $34 million bid.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston could never compete, insiders said, with the 54
electoral votes of California. That storehouse of electoral power
is the prize the DNC and Vice President Al Gore are not likely to
let slip, some said.

COMMENTARY: HOW BIBI GOT RE-ELECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM, June 2, 1999 (NYT) _ Israel's Likud prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, won re-election tonight in a landslide over the
Labor party leader, Ehud Barak, pulling in 64 percent of the vote
against 36 percent for Barak. Pollsters said Netanyahu's lopsided
victory was due to one factor: his decision, on the eve of the
voting, to unilaterally withdraw all Israeli troops from south
Lebanon _ a move that has set off an earthquake in Israeli politics
and throughout the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's come-from-behind victory was stunning. On May 17,
only two weeks ago, in the first round of voting for the prime
ministry, Netanyahu was trounced by Barak, who seemed to be a
shoo-in to win the second and final round.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, though, Netanyahu was sinking in the Lebanese
quagmire, which was killing Israeli boys and seemed destined to
kill his political career too. Israeli pundits were pointing out
that Bibi was handling the Lebanon issue the same way he did the
Palestinian issue _ wavering between one half-baked strategy and
another, using sound bites to defuse it as a political threat to
him, but without being ready to either pull out, use decisive
military force or open talks with Syria that might produce a
decisive diplomatic solution for both Lebanon and the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by an Israeli radio reporter what had prompted him to go
for a unilateral withdrawal, Netanyahu said: ``I finally said to
myself: `Look, what are Israel's strengths? Our political strength
is that we don't want an inch of Lebanon, we're just there for
security. And our technological strength is that we have the most
advanced army in the Middle East, which can deter and trounce any
conventional military threat.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked at it that way,'' continued Netanyahu, ``I
realized that by staying in Lebanon we were actually undermining
both our strengths. Politically we could not defend ourselves,
because when people shot at our boys in Lebanon, the rest of the
world would say: `What do you expect? You're in someone else's
country.' And technologically, we were fighting the most low-tech
guerrilla war possible in a terrain we didn't really know against
an enemy we couldn't really see. The Syrians and Iranians were
getting all the advantages of pressure on us, without any of the
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Israeli troops are out of Lebanon, noted Netanyahu,
everything is reversed: Politically, if the Iranian-directed
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas try to come across the border, they
will be invading Israel, and Israel will be justified in massively
retaliating against Lebanese, Syrian and Iranian troops that abet
such an invasion. And if Israel does retaliate, it won't be with
guerrilla warfare, but with the Israeli Air Force massively
striking Lebanese, Iranian and Syrian military targets in Lebanon,
and maybe inside Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli move has totally unnerved the Syrians, the Hezbollah
guerrillas and Iran. ``They are all now in a quandary,'' said the
Middle East expert Stephen P. Cohen. ``The Hezbollah guerrillas are
saying to themselves: `Now that we have liberated Lebanon, do we
want to use that as leverage to rule Lebanon? Or do we want to use
that as a springboard to move on to Jerusalem?' If they want to do
the latter, now they're really going to have to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said what had really shocked him, though, was Netanyahu's
decision to accompany his unilateral withdrawal with an offer to
resume negotiations with Syria over the Golan Heights _ on whatever
terms Syria wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the Syrians have to choose,'' said Cohen. ``Either they
take up the Israeli offer, and go for full peace, or they are going
to have to pay retail for staying in Lebanon. From now on, the
continued Syrian presence in Lebanon will not be seen as protection
of Lebanese sovereignty but as the only real threat to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's move was welcomed by even some of his harshest
critics. The New York Times Foreign Affairs columnist Thomas L.
Friedman wrote: ``For a long time Bibi has been running on the
slogan that he is `a strong leader for a strong country.' By
constantly avoiding big decisions on the Palestinian and Lebanese
issues, though, Netanyahu did not look like a very strong leader,
and he was making Israel look like not a very strong country. With
this unilateral withdrawal, Bibi has made himself the dynamic
player in the Middle East today, and people will have to give him a
second look.''

DOLE TO START EXPLORATORY PANEL IN SIGN THAT SHE PLANS '00 RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Tenn.)  (js) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a clear sign that she intends to run for
president, Elizabeth Dole, the former president of the American Red
Cross, plans to announce next week that she is starting a committee
that will allow her to explore a candidacy and raise money for a
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign watchers had been picking up uncertain signals about
Mrs. Dole's intentions, particularly as Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, another likely candidate for the Republican nomination,
began accumulating endorsements and scheduled his own announcement
for Sunday that he is starting an exploratory committee. Lamar
Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, plans to announce that
he is running, not just exploring, on Tuesday in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole is now taking several steps to erase any doubts and
begin actively to compete for campaign dollars. She is announcing
the formation of her exploratory committee on Wednesday in Des
Moines, according to Joyce Campbell, a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said she was building a portfolio on various issues and
has bought television time in both Iowa and New Hampshire to run
commercials next week in conjunction with her announcement.
Supporters said that in the commercials she would highlight her
experience as a cabinet member and begin to convey her views, which
are largely unknown since she has never run for office. She also
plans a four-day campaign-style swing around the country.
</P>
<P>
   She has hired a campaign manager, Tom Daffron, a former chief of
staff for Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn. And she has hired a
communications director, Ari Fleischer, who has been the spokesman
for the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole and Bush join more than a half-dozen other Republicans
who have announced similar committees or candidacies, or intend to
in the near future, because the primary schedule is so compressed
and the amount of money finite.
</P>
<P>
   They include Sen. Robert Smith of New Hampshire, the
conservative columnist Pat Buchanan, former Vice President Dan
Quayle, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, the
magazine publisher Steve Forbes and the conservative activist Gary
Bauer.

STARS' BOSS OF BOSSES FACING TOUGH DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This just in from the Boss of Bosses: There will be no
``rent-a-players,'' no Theo Fleurys, for the Dallas Stars in their
1999 Stanley Cup quest.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Tom Hicks isn't interested in parting with any of the
Stars' young, talented minor-league prospects for a player who'll
be history before the ice melts after the last game of the year at
Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get a game misconduct by throwing a temper fit before
you get to Hicks' kicker:
</P>
<P>
   Anyone the Stars trade for _ like NHL stalwarts Mark Recchi of
Montreal or Adam Graves of the New York Rangers, for instance _
should plan on sticking around for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the kinds of the players who could help you for four
or five years to come,'' Hicks said yesterday during a break from a
business meeting in Utah. ``We'd want to sign them long-term.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get the right player, \Rgeneral manager\S Bob
\RGainey\S has my full support. If he can't, we'd just as soon keep
our assets, because we think we can win this year with what we've
got.''
</P>
<P>
   The important thing is that Hicks, Gainey and coach Ken
Hitchcock are all fully committed to a whatever-it-takes approach
to winning the Cup. The Stars are too good and too close to let
this one slip away because they weren't willing to add one more
crucial and necessary piece.
</P>
<P>
   If that means trading the next budding superstar at Kalamazoo,
so be it. We'll help him pack and pin an I-Almost-Did-Dallas bumper
sticker on his sports utility vehicle. These opportunities don't
come along often enough to let them slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to trade a player that would hurt us to do
something that would be of questionable benefit, because everything
is working real well right now,'' Hicks cautioned. ``We have some
issues with the expansion draft coming up this summer and we have
some people we know we might lose. If we could trade somebody we're
going to lose anyway and get somebody who can help us, that would
be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that would be really good. Wouldn't it?
</P>
<P>
   This just in from Hitchcock: Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think our whole view is that we don't want to
undervalue what we've accomplished in two years,'' Hitchcock said
from Long Island, N.Y., where the Stars played the Islanders last
night. ``It's like renting a player and it's a crapshoot. We've had
players come in here and it's taken 8 or 10 weeks for those players
to become acclimatized to our group, to match the energy our
players have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've built a strong chemistry, not just with the players who
are here but the ones who are close at Kalamazoo. When you make a
trade, even for a really good player, other people on your team
have to sacrifice. Roles change. Sometimes that chemistry works and
sometimes it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with a coach who believes in his players and is
willing to go to war with them.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with adding another howitzer to the front line,
though, either.
</P>
<P>
   Did trading for Fleury hurt Colorado's chemistry? On the
contrary, word from the Rocky Mountain State is that Pikes Peak
grew another 2,000 feet. They had to peel the Avalanche players off
the ceiling, they were so electrified by the news.
</P>
<P>
   The message that Colorado management sent to the players came in
neon lights that the whole league could read: We're doing whatever
it takes to win the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary did that in 1988, if you'll recall.
</P>
<P>
   That's the year the Flames traded a young, flashy winger with
thoroughbred bloodlines to the St. Louis Blues for three players
you probably never heard of named Steve Bozek, Robb Ramage and Rick
Wamsley.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Blues got Brett Hull, who had just scored 26 goals and
had 24 assists in his first full NHL season. A year later the
Flames won the only Stanley Cup they've ever won and the three
players they acquired for Hull played key roles.
</P>
<P>
   Was it worth it?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk said, ``I've never
heard anybody in Calgary complain about that trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, who admits he's so focused on dealing with the
players he already has that he'd rather not know what Gainey is
doing until he's asked for his input, remains uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't take away the value of what your team spends
six months trying to accomplish,'' Hitchcock said. ``You already
know what you've got now. You don't know what you've got when you
start making changes. When you make a trade, somebody's coming in,
but somebody's going, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got good players littered throughout our lineup. We have
a relentless type of game that can wear on teams and we don't want
to lose sight of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavens no. Fact is, the Stars are probably good enough to win
the Cup right now. But adding a Recchi or a Graves can only make
them better, especially in the pressure-cooker atmosphere of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks until the NHL trading deadline. Two weeks to show
Colorado that nobody wants the Cup more than the Stars, not just
this year, but every year.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks to go for the jugular.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I'm glad the Boss of Bosses is in charge.

 &HT;    Texas lawmakers reach compromise in children's health insurance
plan
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After weeks of political wrangling, Texas
senators on Thursday crafted a health insurance plan that would
cover young children whose families make up to twice the federal
poverty level. But families making the most money would be cut off
_ at least for the first few years of the program _ as soon as
their children turn 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'd all like to be able to cover every single child
that needs health insurance. But I think we need to be responsible
in how we reach that goal,'' said Sen. Mike Moncrief (D-Fort
Worth), author of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking example of how levers are pushed and pulled at the
Capitol, the Senate's health insurance compromise may end up
boosting the House prospects of a bill to provide tax relief to the
depressed oil and gas industry. The House Ways and Means Committee
approved that measure late Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Health Insurance Program would use federal and
state money to insure children whose families earn too much to
qualify for Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the
poor, but can't afford private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.4 million Texas children don't have health insurance,
and CHIP has garnered nearly unanimous support. The question has
been whether it should cover children in households making up to
twice the federal poverty level or 150 percent of it. The federal
poverty level for a family of four is $16,450.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 471,000 Texas children would be eligible for CHIP
under the 200 percent threshold. About 220,000 are in families
making between 150 percent and 200 percent of the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the 150 percent threshold said it would be
fiscally irresponsible to go any higher because future federal CHIP
contributions are uncertain, and nobody knows how many people will
enroll in the program. Supporters of a 200 percent limit said
advocates of the lower level were overestimating the number of
people who would enroll in the program.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise approved by the Senate Health Services Committee
would cover children up to 10 years old whose families make up to
twice the poverty level. But children between 11 and 18 initially
would be covered only if their families make 150 percent or less of
the poverty standard.
</P>
<P>
   After CHIP begins, the Health and Human Services Commission
would take a look at the program's enrollment every six months to
determine whether the state can afford to ratchet up the income
levels for older kids.
</P>
<P>
   Leading advocates of the 200 percent level praised the Senate
action _ but they still plan to push for the higher threshold for
all children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us are not going to agree to anything less than 200
percent,'' said Rep. Kevin Bailey (D-Houston). ``If it delays it
for a short time, we may be able to live with it, but we need to
get the full coverage up to 200 percent of poverty as soon as
possible for all children,'' he said. Bailey said the key for him
will be who decides whether there is enough money to extend the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Elliott Naishtat (D-Austin) took a harder line.
</P>
<P>
   ``To start out excluding any segment of the potentially eligible
population is a step in the wrong direction,'' Naishtat said. The
Mexican-American Caucus also has issued a statement opposing a CHIP
with different income standards for children of different ages.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers said Thursday's compromise may be connected, at
least indirectly, to a bill that would give a $45 million tax break
to the troubled oil and gas industry. The bill would waive
severance taxes due between Feb. 1 and Aug. 31 on crude oil
production from ``stripper'' wells that produce 15 barrels a day or
less, as long as the price of oil has been less than $15 for three
months in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush gave the oil and gas legislation emergency
status, and it has already won Senate approval. But a two-thirds
vote in the House is needed to keep it on a fast-track, and many
House Democrats were troubled by the prospect of taking emergency
action to help the oil industry without providing health insurance
to as many children as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that we lead the nation in uninsured children _
that is at least as important an emergency as what the oil industry
is facing,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush remained noncommital Thursday night about his support for
the CHIP compromise and denied there was any deal. ``There is no
quid pro quo when it comes to CHIP or any other piece of
legislation,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on Thursday, the Capitol was buzzing with rumors that
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rene Oliveira allowed the
bill, which had been bogged down, to be voted out of committee
Wednesday in response to the emerging CHIP compromise. Oliveira
denied a direct link, but he acknowledged that the CHIP agreement
might persuade some of his colleagues to support the oil and gas
bill on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to mix the apples and oranges _ but I know some
members are,'' Oliveira said.

 &HT;    House, Senate honor journalist for integrity
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The House and Senate stopped Thursday to honor
the late Carole Kneeland, a longtime Austin journalist who died
last year of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Kneeland, the wife of Austin American-Statesman columnist Dave
McNeely, was known as an advocate for aggressive reporting and
strict ethics for journalists. She help create ``truth tests'' for
political advertising and clear criteria for determining a public
interest before reporting crime. She died Jan. 26, 1998, at age 49
after fighting her cancer for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although time cannot diminish the tragedy of a rich life cut
prematurely short, neither can it dim the memory of this remarkable
individual,'' the Senate said in a resolution unanimously adopted
Thursday. ``The joy and dedication Carole Kneeland brought to her
life and work will burn on brightly forever in the hearts of all
those fortunate enough to have known her.''
</P>
<P>
   COLONIAS MAY GET OMBUDSMEN
</P>
<P>
   Residents of colonias, which are substandard developments in the
border region, would get some relief under budget recommendations
from the Special Senate Committee on Border Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Senate Finance Committee, the panel
recommended approval of Secretary of State Elton Bomer's proposal
to station six ombudsmen along the Texas-Mexico border. The
ombudsmen would help residents of colonias secure modern water and
wastewater services under state and federal programs. Hidalgo,
Cameron, Starr, Maverick, Webb and El Paso counties would each get
one ombudsman. The plan would cost $300,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The border committee also recommended a $50 million boost in the
state's Housing Trust Fund, which assists low-income families in
the border region and elsewhere around the state. This could create
more than 7,000 new housing units, according to an analysis by the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The panel stopped short of endorsing a proposal for a five-year,
$2 billion program to build 40,000 units of affordable housing in
the border region. The proposal was announced last week by Daisy
Stiner, executive director of the Texas Department of Housing and
Community Affairs. The committee recommended allocating $750,000
for a feasibility study of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   SALES-TAX HOLIDAY NOT DEAD
</P>
<P>
   Though it's no longer on his list of priorities, Gov. George W.
Bush's office continues to express interest in a so-called
sales-tax holiday.
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigned for re-election last year, Bush said he would
include among his legislative proposals a two-week ``holiday'' from
the sales tax on children's clothing. That proposal was dropped
after Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander projected
lower-than-expected revenue during the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that announcement, Bush budget chief Albert Hawkins
appeared Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee to talk about
a broader sales-tax holiday. That proposal, by Sen. Rodney Ellis,
D-Houston, would eliminate the sales tax from any clothing item
worth $200 or less for nine days in August. Ellis said he would be
open to lowering the no-tax threshold, though he doesn't want it
too low.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said the holiday idea still is a valid way to get
consumer sales-tax cuts this year. As written, the sales-tax
holiday would cost the state about $120 million during the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
   NEW WATER DISTRICT IN WORKS
</P>
<P>
   The use of underground water in Bastrop and Lee counties would
be regulated for the first time under legislation introduced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would create a ground-water conservation district
with powers to require permits and impose fees. Most residential,
agricultural and smaller commercial wells would be exempt.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Bastrop-Lee County Groundwater Conservation
District could require users to obtain permits before transferring
ground water to other areas. San Antonio has proposed pumping
ground water from that area and piping it across several rivers and
creeks to ease that city's dependence on local supplies.
</P>

<P>
   Using information once jealously guarded by oil and gas
companies, scientists have for the first time identified a major
fault under downtown Los Angeles of a kind whose existence there
they previously could only infer. They say it is capable of
producing a devastating earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have for years believed that such faults, called
blind thrusts, exist beneath the city. But this is the first solid
proof that one is actually present, said Dr. James Dolan, a
professor of geology at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The research adds support to the theory, emerging in the last
decade, that Los Angeles is threatened more by faults like this
one, which lie concealed underground right inside the city, than by
the famous and much larger San Andreas fault, a visible scar
running across the landscape 60 miles east of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many blind thrust faults might lie beneath Los
Angeles, experts said on Thursday that they did not know. But Dolan
said there was unlikely to be another the size of the newly
identified one, which would measure 250 square miles on the surface
and is believed to be at least nine miles deep.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``the poster child of blind thrust faults underneath Los
Angeles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, who was not among the researchers, said they had ``nailed
its location'' and determined that it was under increasing strain.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Henyey, co-director of the Southern California
Earthquake Center, a consortium of academic and government
institutions with headquarters at the University of Southern
California, said the finding would add to the data that scientists
and policy makers consider in evaluating building codes and the
design of crucial complexes like hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The fault was identified by Dr. John Shaw, a structural
geologist at Harvard University, and Dr. Peter Shearer, a
seismologist at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla,
Calif. Their work is described in Friday's issue of the journal
Science.
</P>
<P>
   Thrust faults, which exist elsewhere and have long been thought
to lie beneath Los Angeles, in part because of surface features
that occur within the city, are given their name because of the
activity they induce in earthquakes. In a quake caused by what is
called a slip-strike fault, like the San Andreas, the blocks of
earth slide past each other horizontally. But in a quake caused by
a thrust fault, whose fracture of the earth dips along at angles
that can be either shallow or steep, the blocks move diagonally,
almost vertically.
</P>
<P>
   Such movement may cause rocks to fold just below the surface. Or
it may create small hills on the surface. But that evidence of a
quake can easily erode away or be bulldozed to make room for
apartment buildings, leaving the fault invisible, or ``blind.''
</P>
<P>
   The blind thrust faults of Los Angeles, Shaw explained, are
caused by the relative motion of the North American and Pacific
plates, two huge masses of crust that are sliding past each other
along the San Andreas fault. Because of a dogleg in the fault, the
Los Angeles basin is being squeezed like an accordion between these
masses of earth. The ground under the city is compressing by a
fifth of an inch a year, Shaw said, and some of that stress is
building up on one fault or another somewhere out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign that the Los Angeles basin had potentially
dangerous blind thrust faults came in 1987 with the Whittier
Narrows earthquake, a magnitude-6 temblor on the Richter scale,
that killed eight people and caused property damage of $358
million. No fault had been mapped in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude-6.7 Northridge earthquake of 1994, also on a blind
thrust fault that had not been mapped, killed 33 people and caused
damage worth $35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But when scientists began looking for blind thrust faults, they
could only infer their existence from folds in sand and gravel
layers near the surface, Dolan said. The largest of these earlier
inferred faults is called the Elysian Park fault, which like the
newly identified one, apparently lies under parts of downtown Los
Angeles. But its actual size is not known.
</P>
<P>
   To find blind faults, Shaw said, scientists must identify
geologic structures underground, a task with which the oil and gas
industry is quite familiar. Petroleum companies have been drilling
and exploring in the Los Angeles basin for decades, seeking pockets
of oil and gas. The methods they use can also be employed to gain
evidence of faults: setting off small explosions on the surface and
measuring the way sound waves propagate through the ground or
measuring the velocity of sound in rocks during drilling.
</P>
<P>
   The oil and gas companies long kept their findings secret,
however, regarding them as highly proprietary.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaw, who once worked for Texaco as a petroleum geologist,
said major petroleum companies were now pulling out of Los Angeles
because of strict environmental regulations and the depletion of
oil and gas there. The companies are now willing to turn their old
data over to researchers, he said, in return for improved
techniques that will help them search for oil and gas elsewhere,
using new data.
</P>
<P>
   It was oil company information, Shaw said, that led to the
discovery of the newly identified fault, called the Puente Hills
blind thrust because it lies along the Puente Hills near the town
of Whittier, in Orange County. The fracture, he said, showed up
clearly on 10 seismic profiles _ so clearly, in fact, that
distinctive characteristics could be discerned on each side of the
fault.
</P>
<P>
   The fault runs east-west for about 25 miles from Century City to
Coyote Hills in northern Orange County. If it came to the surface,
it would be about 10 miles wide. Underground, the entire fault dips
at about 27 degrees to the north and appears to form three distinct
segments, termed Los Angeles, Santa Fe Springs and Coyote Hills.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fault is active. Using new techniques for calibrating the
epicenter of past earthquakes and oil company data on sound
velocities, Shearer discovered that the Whittier Narrows earthquake
was caused by the Puente Hills fault. Moreover, the earthquake
ruptured only 10 percent of the blocks on that segment of the
fault, which means that the quake probably left a great deal of
stress on the immediate segment and adjoining segments.
</P>
<P>
   Each fault segment is capable of generating a Northridge-size
earthquake, Shaw said. If all three segments ruptured
simultaneously, a much more damaging, magnitude 7 earthquake could
occur.
</P>
<P>
   The record of prehistoric ruptures on the Puente Hills fault is
not known. Each segment could break every 250 to 1,000 years and a
triple whammy might happen once every 500 to 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   No large earthquake has occurred within the Los Angeles basin
since 1850, when European settlers first began to keep records.

<P>
   CBS' Monopoly board for the NCAA men's basketball tournament
finally has a ticket to get out of regional jail.
</P>
<P>
   So what's it worth to ya?
</P>
<P>
   Dishing out feeds of the first three rounds to satellite service
DirecTV starting this year was a bit of a concession for the
network, which is very protective of its $1 billion investment in
the tournament. But because of DirecTV's nonthreatening saturation
_ the up-and-coming service remains in just one of every 22 TV
homes _ CBS finally agreed to yield.
</P>
<P>
   When the tournament starts Thursday, those who might feel stuck
in a so-called ``area of interest'' but really have no interest in
watching _ for example, a West Coast-based team in Southern
California _ have the option of a four-channel subscription package
with DirecTV's ``Mega March Mania'' for $39 (all of the first three
rounds) or $14.95 a game.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't order it won't see anything different out of
CBS, the network reminds everyone, and you probably won't miss
anything important. At least, in theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``All network coverage is very valuable and CBS is the proper
place for the tournament forever as far as we're concerned,'' said
Mike Aresco, CBS' vice president of programming for college sports.
``This closes the circle, so to speak, for the diehard fan and the
displaced alumni.''
</P>
<P>
   Aresco said he wasn't sure how much of a demand there is for
this option, but ``we heard from viewers and read in papers that
people want to see other games sometimes, so we ultimately decided
it was time to address it on an experimental basis and see how it
goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's created a lot more preliminary work for us, but one of
the things we hope this helps do is strengthen our network model
and blunt criticism of the network coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe the best way to watch is on CBS, where you
get a seamless journey that gets the fan involved. But this other
way, if there's fan interest in one particular game, he can switch
back and forth outside the region.''
</P>
<P>
   From DirecTV's perspective, this is a natural extension of its
sports pay service. It has offered regular-season packages of games
for all four major pro sports, plus college football and
basketball, the WNBA and Major League Soccer. The regular-season
college basketball package (ESPN FullCourt) was $49 for hundreds of
out-of-market games from Jan. 16 to March 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're comfortable we can pull it off and they felt comfortable
with us,'' said Rob Jacobson, DirecTV's vice president of
programming. ``This is really one of the last untapped frontiers in
sports TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson agreed that because DirecTV is in 4.6 million of the
more than 100 million TV homes ``really played to our favor.''
DirecTV recently purchased PrimeStar and its 2.3 million customers,
those folks won't have access on their services.
</P>
<P>
   To get the word out, DirecTV has been running ads on CBS'
college basketball programming and promoting it on CBS SportsLine's
Web site. It also hired James Worthy, who'll be doing analyst work
for CBS during the tournament, as a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few glitches in the DirecTV service:
</P>
<P>
   __ If you're a UCLA fan and want to see the entire game, even if
it's a blowout, CBS remains the only local outlet. DirecTV not only
has to black out that game on its service here, but it can't pick
it up if CBS switches to another game.
</P>
<P>
   __ The 10-plus-hours-a-day coverage of the first round on
Thursday and March 12 starts at 9 a.m., and that's work time for
many. Is it worth it if you're not around to watch it?
</P>
<P>
   __ The DirecTV system has to be continuously connected to a
land-based phone line to work for this.
</P>
<P>
   __ And, for those restaurants and bars that have traditionally
pulled CBS' wild feeds off the C-band dish for their customers,
they have to take the DirecTV package now.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone without DirecTV can buy it (it's even for lease in some
places) in time for Thursday's opening tipoff because installation
takes three-to-five days after the purchase of the dish. With
current promotional packages, that can cost about $200 for both. It
can even be ordered online.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about that big-screen TV. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Tournament showtime: Both CBS' and ESPN's selection shows
start at 3:30 p.m. Sunday, but when CBS peels off after a half hour
for ``60 Minutes'' in the East, ESPN goes another 60 minutes with
its coverage until 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case in recent years, CBS has exclusive rights
to the first announcement of the pairings and will do so with host
Greg Gumbel and Clark Kellogg.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN, which has had its tournament selection show since 1980,
takes the NCAA info and minutes later builds its brackets with host
Chris Fowler and analysts Digger Phelps, Dick Vitale and Jay Bilas.
ESPN also has a special for the women's pairings at 2 p.m. &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   __ Attention He-Men-Wommin'-Haters Club: ESPN2 has Beth Mowins _
yup, a girl _ doing play-by-play on the Big Sky Conference title
game (Saturday, 7:30 p.m.). She also did ESPN2's play-by-play on
the SEC women's championship last Sunday and the Conference USA
women's championship on Monday. &QL; 
__ Chicago-based One-On-One's nationwide sports-talk feed, heard
locally on AM-1540, has Joe McDonnell on a sort-of tryout tonight
in the 11 p.m.-to-3 a.m. hole. &QL; 
__ Fred Wallin's weekly sports-business talk show has added
Ventura-based affiliate KVTA-AM (1520) Saturdays from 4 to 6 p.m.
Wallin has been doing the show for the last two years with
affiliates from Portland, Ore., to Miami, Fla. &QL; 
__ The KLCS-Channel 58 high school coverage has a L.A. City
basketball finals doubleheader tonight and a soccer finals
doubleheader Saturday _ all with Randy Rosenbloom doing the call.
Tonight's basketball starts with the girls' title game (Palisades
vs. Washington) at 6 p.m. followed by the boys (Manual Arts vs.
Fairfax). Saturday's soccer starts with the girls' Southern Section
Division IV final (San Pedro vs. Chatsworth) at 4 p.m. followed by
the boys' City final at 6 p.m. &QL; 
__ ESPN's ``Baseball Tonight'' returns Monday at 7 p.m. with Karl
Ravech, Peter Gammons and Harold Reynolds based at the ESPN Club in
Orlando, Fla.!dlim!WHAT CHOKES!dlim!
</P>
<P>
   __ Just when we got used to seeing Joe Buck on Fox's horse
racing shows, the network has trotted out Kenny Albert as the new
host, starting with Saturday's coverage of the Santa Anita Handicap
(Channel 11, 2 p.m.) Nothing against Albert, but. . . . ``I'm sure
some viewers will be apprehensive until they see me do it the first
time,'' said Albert, working his first horse racing event. ``I
faced the same situation when Fox hired me to do the NFL.'' Adds
Fox Sports exec producer Ed Goren: ``Kenny can provide an
everyman's curiosity in the booth.'' Which is what Buck did, too,
ya know? &QL; 
__ Fox continues to horse around with its ``virtual finish line,''
a computer-enhanced orange line that's supposed to mark the most
important strip of dirt on the track. Except, as they said when it
debuted in the Donn Handicap last month, it's not the actual finish
line but about six inches short of it. The Donn finish wasn't close
enough to make it useful, so maybe Saturday's race will put it to
use. &QL; 
__ One of radio's most refreshing promotions _ put someone up on a
billboard and don't let them come down until (fill in the cause
here) _ has been brought back by the wily publicity-seeking
pranksters at AM-1150. Morning news reader Allie MacKay is atop an
1150 billboard on Lankershim and Chiquita in Universal City. She
will stay there _ if you can believe it!!!_ until the Clippers,
whose games are aired into a black hole on the station, win their
first game. What, was the Vic Jacobs swallowing-goldfish idea
already used? Here's something to try . . . aw, never mind. That
would imply we care.

WASHINGTON ELITE GATHER TO HONOR ARIZONA'S MO UDALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress, it seems, never needed Mo Udall more.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 members of Washington's power elite gathered Thursday
to honor the Arizona congressional legend as a man who possessed
qualities now considered more precious than ever before on Capitol
Hill:
</P>
<P>
   Grace, civility and, above all, humor.
</P>
<P>
   With the rancor of President Clinton's impeachment trial still
fresh in their minds, Udall's former House and Senate pals immersed
themselves in memories.
</P>
<P>
   Udall, who died in December, was remembered as the best, and the
funniest, of a bygone era before national politics turned _ in the
words of former Sen. Alan Simpson _ ``mean-spirited, pinched and
driven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He would not have liked what has happened in these chambers,''
Simpson, R-Wyo., said at the service. His stories of Udall's life,
which included debilitating Parkinson's disease, provoked a blend
of laughter and tears.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers gathered in an ornate room in the Cannon House
Office Building, from where the Democrat Udall represented Arizona
for 30 years. His son, Mark, was elected to Congress last year from
Colorado and maintains an office in the same building. So does Mo's
nephew, Tom Udall, who was elected to the House last year from New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights from Thursday's speeches:
</P>
<P>
   _Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., said she marveled at how Udall
could be such a staunch environmentalist coming from a state
``where the trees have turned to rock'' and where the ground is
``covered with kitty litter.'' Udall had been fond of the ``kitty
litter'' analogy himself.
</P>
<P>
   _David Broder of ``The Washington Post'' said residents of New
Hampshire had been in ``culture shock'' when Udall began
campaigning for president in their state because he was ``a crazy,
one-eyed Mormon from St. Johns, Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   _Brad Udall said that humorist Art Buchwald once delivered some
of Mo's best punch lines right before Mo was supposed to speak. So
Mo told the crowd that he and Buchwald had made a deal to switch
speeches in advance, and that now Mo was left with Buchwald's
inferior address.
</P>
<P>
   _Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said of Udall, ``Mo knew there were
SOBs in politics, but he knew that you didn't have to be one to
beat one.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark and Tom Udall were joined at the ceremony by a number of
dignitaries, including Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and his
wife, Hattie, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, Senate Minority
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, R-Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizonans attending included Republican Sen. John McCain,
former Democratic Sen. Dennis DeConcini, Democratic Rep. Ed Pastor,
Republican Rep. Jim Kolbe, White House aide Fred DuVal, and Mike
Rappoport, a top manager of the Salt River Project utility. Members
of Udall's family in attendance included his wife, Norma, sons
Mark, Brad and Vince, and daughters Anne and Kate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain introduced a Senate resolution declaring Udall ``a model
member of Congress'' and an ``example of bipartisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   A portrait of Udall with a wry smile was placed in front of the
seated lawmakers. It was flanked by an American flag and an Arizona
flag. A U.S. Army chorus sang ``The Impossible Dream.'' Mo Udall
might have joked that the song was a metaphor for his failed 1976
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The service was less somber than a memorial held in Tucson in
January, closer to his death. Mostly, the members of Congress
feasted on Udall's own stories and jokes.
</P>
<P>
   In his time, they said, Udall had what every politician wants:
the ability to engage an audience. It sprang from his wit, his
sincerity, his humor and a sparkle in his one good eye. He lost the
other in a childhood accident. &QL;

N.H. HOUSE VOTES PERSONAL INCOME TAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ A cherished New Hampshire symbol trembled
Thursday when the 400-member House of Representatives voted to
enact the state's first personal income tax.
</P>
<P>
   The historic measure, which passed by only four votes, is
intended to address a 1997 court order that rejected the state's
system of funding public schools almost exclusively through local
property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   That order gave the governor and Legislature until April 1 of
this year to find a solution. If they miss the deadline, the school
portion of local property taxes will become uncollectable and
teachers will begin receiving pink slips.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed by a 194-190 margin, would establish a 4
percent personal income tax combined with a $6 per $1,000 valuation
statewide property tax that would mainly hit vacation homes and
commercial property. Primary residences would be exempt from the
new tax _ a change that would drastically lower tax bills for
people now paying as much as $5,000 per year on a $100,000 home.
Existing property taxes for non-school services would remain in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with an increased cigarette tax and other revenues, the
bill would raise some $960 million of the state's $1.3 billion
annual public education budget.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers say passage of the bill by New Hampshire's
new Democratically-controlled Senate is virtually assured.
</P>
<P>
   That means that unless Governor Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat,
makes good on her standing threat to veto any income tax that is
not approved by statewide referendum, New Hampshire will lose its
status as the only state never to have enacted a broad-based sales
or income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Though some states allow for such a question to be put before
voters, New Hampshire does not, and the state Supreme Court has yet
to issue a requested advisory opinion on whether a referendum would
be constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen plans to announce a tax plan of her own next week. It
reportedly relies largely on revenues from an expansion of gambling
at the state's four race tracks and an increase in taxes on
business.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued shortly after the vote, the governor
reaffirmed her pledge to veto an income tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that an income tax is the wrong solution for New
Hampshire and that we can solve this problem without such a tax,''
Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
   There may be enough votes to override a veto in the Senate, but
there probably are not enough to override it in the House, where
Republicans are the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the combined 4 percent income tax came despite
Shaheen's threat and a furious anti-tax advertising campaign backed
by some of the state's most influential business executives, its
Republican congressional delegation, and four past Republican
governors.
</P>
<P>
   The ads warned, ``We need not look any further than to our
neighbors in other New England states to see that the result of an
income tax will be an exploding bureaucracy and rapid expansion of
the size and scope of state government.''
</P>
<P>
   If the tax is enacted, it will alter the flow of tax dollars
between New Hampshire and neighboring states. New Hampshire will
gain about $60 million in income tax revenues now paid by residents
who cross the border to work in Massachusetts, according to state
Senator Mark Fernald, one of the bill's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, about 75,000 New Hampshire residents worked in
Massachusetts, and roughly 18,000 Bay Staters worked north of the
border. Judging by congestion on Interstate 93, those figure are
now much higher, according to Tom Duffy, a New Hampshire state
planner.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Massachusetts levies a 5.95 percent income tax on New
Hampshire residents who work in Massachusetts. If the New Hampshire
tax passes, however, the bottom line for commuters will be the
same: If you live in one state and work in another you pay first to
the state where the income is earned, then pay the difference _ if
one exists _ to your home state.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstatic income tax proponents said the vote marked the death of
the vaunted anti-tax ``pledge'' that all successful gubernatorial
candidates in recent decades have taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making up for 100 years of propaganda around this
place,'' said Senate President Clesson ``Junie'' Blaisdell.
``People know that the way we've done it over the years is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates said the vote also spotlighted the waning political
power of the state's biggest newspaper, The Union Leader of
Manchester, whose conservative publisher, the late William Loeb,
crafted the pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Blaisdell was not optimistic about the governor's ability to
sell her plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is talking about business in New Hampshire picking up
another couple hundred million dollars in taxes,'' he said. ``That
is going to be a tough sell.''
</P>
<P>
   State Representative Elizabeth Hager, the prime sponsor of the
new tax bill, said its passage in the House also signaled a shift
away from strict conservative domination of the state's Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been a Republican state and it still is but
these people were ready for an income tax,'' Hager said. ``This is
the fairest way to do it.''

3RD UNION LEADER BREAKS RANKS IN AMERICA WEST TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A strike coordinator for America West Airlines' flight
attendants union who resigned this week said Thursday that the
airline made informal offers to come close to matching the union's
$74.5 million contract demands.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Baister is the third union leader to break ranks in the
past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The union and the company are $5.8 million apart on a contract
and the relatively narrow gap is not enough to justify a strike,
said Baister, who resigned Tuesday in frustration with the
Association of Flight Attendants Council 66 leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a union supporter, but this is an insignificant amount of
money to go out on strike for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Bunch, chairwoman of the union's negotiating team, and
Taina McDowell were removed Feb. 10 because they supported an offer
the union rejected three times in December, according to union
President Bill McGlashen.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell said Thursday that company negotiators made informal
offers in January that exceeded their official offer of $68.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   She questioned whether a strike, which could begin after March
19, is justified if the two sides are so close.
</P>
<P>
   But confusion remains about the offers and how far apart the two
sides really are, according to Baister, who says she and other
flight attendants are frustrated that they can't get straight
answers from union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   When the union pegged its contract demand at $74.5 million in a
Feb. 24 letter to members, it appeared that there was only $5.8
million separating the two sides, not the $16.5 million figure
McGlashen had been talking about since an impasse was declared in
early February.
</P>
<P>
   America West was encouraged that both sides were within reach of
a settlement, and in a Feb. 27 letter urged the union to work
toward ironing out a deal.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, McGlashen said the union valued the company's offer
at $58 million and the gap remains at $16.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Baister and McDowell say the union has said at its meetings
that the company's offer is $68.7 million in new costs over the
five years of the contract. That is in addition to the current
labor costs for flight attendants of $67.6 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   If the gap is $5.8 million, that amounts to just $1.16 million
per year separating the two sides, or an average of about $483 for
each flight attendant. The difference for individual flight
attendants is just $40 per month.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashen said Thursday that regardless of what values the
company and the union place on their offers, the fact remains that
the two sides are $16.5 million apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company never made an offer that got close to ours,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Baister's resignation, McGlashen said there has been
no ``slippage in solidarity'' among the 2,400 union members as the
strike deadline approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is typical when you're in this countdown,'' he said of
Baister's decision to leave. ``It's stressful and it's tough.
Everyone is wondering if we are going to have a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   America West obviously is hoping it can avoid a walkout, but
would not comment on the resignation of the strike coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to make an agreement that is affordable, fair to
the flight attendants and consistent with and fair with regard to
the arrangements we have with our other employees,'' said Stephen
Johnson, senior vice president of corporate affairs.
</P>
<P>
   No negotiations have been set, but are expected to begin next
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, America West is continuing to try to clarify
the union's offer and reach a settlement. Greg Garger, vice
president for labor relations, sent a letter to McGlashen on
Tuesday seeking clarification of the union's offer. &QL;

 &HT;    Crystal, De Niro held hostage by contrived plot
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``Garbo laughs!'' screamed the tagline for
``Ninotchka,'' the 1939 Ernst Lubitsch gem, in which a famously
stiff Greta Garbo tossed back her head and let fly a liberating
guffaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``De Niro cries!'' could sell the diverting but uneven mob
comedy ``Analyze This,'' where Robert De Niro spoofs his indelible
persona by, among other things, bawling.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro plays formidable New York wiseguy Paul Vitti, an
aspiring don with shiny suits and shiny hair. (Right now you're
thinking: De Niro can do this role in his sleep. He can, and he
does.)
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, Paul is seized by panic attacks: can't sleep, can't
perform in bed, can't inspire terror in his rivals. He's short of
breath. He weeps.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro's whimpers are, of course, as unlikely as Garbo's laugh.
It's a sight. His tears are blubbery and overwrought, wrung right
out of vaudeville. They are comic cloudbursts no less hammy than
the Cowardly Lion's in ``The Wizard of Oz.'' Shudder to think.
</P>
<P>
   A contrived happenstance lands De Niro mug-to-mug with uptown
therapist Ben Sobol, played by Billy Crystal, who muffles his usual
impish cutes. If the setup sounds familiar, you might have seen
``The Sopranos,'' the new HBO series that has the head of a mob
family in therapy for anxiety attacks. (Both parties have claimed
ignorance.)
</P>
<P>
   So here's your high concept: What if a guy who's used to getting
his way by physical force finds himself in the painstakingly
cerebral process of psychotherapy, where the shrink gets to ask the
questions? The equation _ polar opposites clash for laughs _ is a
time-honored device that works OK for a stretch, but gasps as
``Analyze This'' reaches an ironic epiphany we saw coming miles
ago.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro soon warms up to this therapy thing and forces the
reluctant Crystal to remain his shrink. Some mild but obvious
laughs spring from their sessions. When Crystal brings up the
Oedipal complex, De Niro impatiently insists, ``English, English.''
There's also plenty to make you squirm. (``If you turn me into a
gay, you're dead!'' Say what?)
</P>
<P>
   De Niro proves a needy client as he struggles to keep a stoic
front for the increasingly suspicious mob. His unorthodox demands
make a shambles of Crystal's middle-class placidity, mangling the
shrink's efforts to marry his fiancee (the exquisitely bubbly Lisa
Kudrow) and eventually landing him in the mafia's cross hairs.
</P>
<P>
   Director Harold Ramis (``Caddyshack'') sustains a snappy pace
and never overplays his parody of the genre. But the script, by
Ramis and two other writers, lacks tang and the crunch of
freshness. The movie ingratiates with slapstick, poop and crotch
jokes _ weak emergency measures when intelligence fails.
</P>
<P>
   And you'd expect more pyrotechnics between De Niro and Crystal.
The dearth of chemistry is a problem of the actors' generosity:
Neither seems willing to abandon his popular repertoire, and the
results bump rather than click.
</P>
<P>
   Save for his acerbic turn in ``Midnight Run,'' De Niro hasn't
had great luck with comedy. He mugs relentlessly and simply
transposes his volatile thug persona into a clownish parody. The
always likable Crystal is held hostage by a passive role that asks
him to react for most of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   As with too much Hollywood product these days, mechanical
writing is the culprit for what could have been an edgy, incisive
comedy. The big machine seems terrified of startling the megaplex
masses with anything brash and fresh. Its idea of audacity is to
toss around the F-word like handfuls of confetti. (Only Samuel L.
Jackson gives the word more poetic punch than De Niro.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyze This'' amounts to a collection of modest comic bits in
a homogenized whole. Thinking about what it could have been is
enough to make a grown man cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyze This''
</P>
<P>

MALONE SAID TO HAVE BLOCKED FIRING OF TREASURY AIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Robert E. Foley, a high-ranking treasury official
charged with stealing $2.4 million from a fund under his control,
was slated to be fired last summer for abusive behavior but
then-Treasurer Joseph D. Malone blocked the move, people familiar
with the situation said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Malone told his staff members to work out their
differences with Foley, who had landed his job with the help of
Richard C. Arrighi, a major contributor to the former treasurer's
campaign as well as a Boston attorney who represented Foley in real
estate deals.
</P>
<P>
   Malone denied Thursday that Foley, a former deputy treasurer,
was close to being fired, but confirmed he asked his underlings to
resolve their dispute. He said Arrighi, a fund-raiser he had known
since 1990, never asked him to save Foley's job.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prosecutors for the first time linked Foley's alleged
scam to John Trischitta, who worked for Foley and was arrested two
weeks ago on charges he helped Martin Robbins, an ``heir finder,''
pilfer $6.5 million from the same account, the Unpaid Check Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Carol Starkey argued at Foley's
arraignment that he and Trischitta worked together to raid the
fund, where unclaimed state payments are held, over the last five
years. She provided no further details.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, 39, was arrested Wednesday on charges of larceny and
bribery for allegedly siphoning $2.4 million from the account.
Sources said Foley had Trischitta sign large unpaid checks over to
him, funneling the cash through outside companies, including the
Reinke Group Inc., owned by Thomas Ciliberto of Woonsocket, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Ciliberto, also arrested Wednesday, pleaded not guilty in Boston
Municipal Court and was expected to be released on $10,000 cash
bail or $100,000 surety. Foley was also released on $25,000 cash
bail after pleading not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests, combined with the disclosure of Arrighi's
relationship with Foley, raises new questions about Malone's
eight-year tenure at the treasury. When the scandal first broke
last month, Malone defended his management and blamed an errant
employee for the problems. But with the involvement of Foley, one
of Malone's five top deputies, he now must face the fact that one
of the worst cases of public corruption in recent state history
took place on his watch.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, who left his job last Friday, had clashed repeatedly with
employees and managers.
</P>
<P>
   Tonia Duchano took over management of the treasury's Abandoned
Property Division, where the unclaimed funds were transferred after
13 months, when treasury officials were unsatisfied with Foley's
controls over the account. She said she continually asked for him
to be fired, and after several meetings with Malone, the treasurer
agreed Foley should be dismissed or transferred to the state
Lottery. But nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right before the primary, I went in to have a meeting with
Joe,'' said Duchano, now in a private sector job. ``I had a blunt
talk with Joe and I said, `I don't understand why Foley's still
here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Malone apolgized, she recalls, and said he thought Duchano and
Foley were getting along.
</P>
<P>
   Malone confirmed her account but denied an unconfirmed report
that Arrighi had spoken with him about keeping Foley.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the best of my knowledge that did not occur,'' Malone said.
``It's an interesting thing. There was clearly a conflict between
Bob (Foley) and Tonia (Duchano) but the people in Bob's department
were very complimentary of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrighi, 40, has personally contributed to Malone, giving the
legal maxium of $500 in 1995, 1997, and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A native Rhode Islander, Arrighi was hired as a partner at Burns
&AMP; Levinson last year when the Boston law firm expanded its
commercial and real estate finance practices. He also worked for
Warner &AMP; Stackpole, a firm that handled one-third of the bond deals
under Malone. Foley used Arrighi to set up two real estate trusts
to buy commercial and residential parcels in 1990 and 1991, when he
joined the treasurer's office.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are trying to determine if any of the nearly $9
million stolen from the Unpaid Check Fund since the early 1990s
wound up in those trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Arrighi did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in Malone's office said the issue with Foley was that he
rubbed colleagues the wrong way and refused to take direction from
his superiors. At the time, there was no evidence of his alleged
scheme to steal millions from the state's Unpaid Check Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials were also angry that Foley had begun a
relationship with his assistant in the cash management division,
Amelia Tamburrini. Both were recently divorced and plan to marry.
</P>
<P>
   Foley was deputy treasurer in charge of cash management until
new Treasurer Shannon O'Brien replaced him last Friday with her own
appointee.
</P>
<P>
   Foley had been put in charge of making changes in the cash
management division, but refused to carry out any of the plans
Thomas Trimarco, Malone's top aide, and others wanted implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Other Malone staff members confirmed Foley was constantly at
odds with other treasury officials, often acting rudely and failing
to cooperate or take orders from Trimarco. The issue boiled over
last summer while Malone was deeply involved in his bid to win the
Republican gubernatorial nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Trimarco repeatedly complained to Malone about
Foley and agitated for resolution. Trimarco was not available for
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, sounding subdued, said he felt as if he had been
``punched in the stomach'' by the emerging scandal.

 Column: Why HP's Decision to Spin Off Its Measurement Unit
Makes  Sense  By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Perhaps Hewlett-Packard should call its proposed offspring ``HP
Classic.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, the test and measurement operation that will be at
the heart of the new independent company is the very business upon
which Mssrs. Hewlett and Packard founded their world-famous
granddaddy of garage startups.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they started the company, HP was the leader in the test
and measurement industry,'' says Shekar Gopalan, an industry
analyst for Mountain View consultancy Frost and Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   And HP Classic _ or whatever _ should still be the lead dog when
it comes to market share. The unit currently controls about 41
percent of the $10 billion (sales) test and measurement market.
Plus, judging by previous performance, it should rake in another
$3.4 billion or so in sales from three other solid business
segments: medical instruments, electronic components and chemical
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   HP Classic ``has everything to gain from the spin-off,'' says
Gopalan, an unabashed fan of HP's decision to split the T&AMP;M
business from the company's more dominant computer and printer
segment. While sputtering, HP's sexier information technology
operations account for about $40 billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, by getting out from under the formidable shadow of the
colossal computer biz, ``the new measurement company is likely to
be more focused and will thrive like an entrepreneurial startup,''
Gopalan predicts.
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly what corporate divestitures are supposed to
do. The breakup of Sears, Roebuck is a prime example.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, after nearly a decade of lackluster stock
performance, Sears abandoned its ``socks to stocks'' strategy by
spinning off Dean Witter, Discover, Allstate, Coldwell Banker and
its commercial development company.
</P>
<P>
   The old Sears was so unwieldy that few investors were aware that
the merchant owned half of Prodigy, the online service, in a joint
venture with IBM.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET05 (91318 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  For years, the mismanagement of Sears' underperforming core
retail business was camouflaged by the success of the other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Once it was stripped to the bare retailer, investors could more
clearly monitor how it was performing _ for better or worse. And
the other companies, in turn, fetched higher values after being cut
loose.
</P>
<P>
   The same should hold true for HP. Earlier this week, the company
announced its plan to split itself into two parts. The announcement
thus far has drawn a lukewarm response from investors. HP stock
closed on Tuesday, the day of the announcement, at $68.63, up
$2.75. But yesterday, while the Dow soared 191.52, HP stock fell
$1.38 to $67.44.
</P>
<P>
   In Wall Street parlance, the corporate restructuring is actually
more of ``carve out'' than a ``spin-off.'' A spin-off is when a
company decides to sell a division or a business unit by offering a
majority stake to the public in an initial offering.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, HP plans to offer a minority stake of HP Classic
to the public in September or October at a still undetermined
price. In other words, HP is carving out 15 percent of its $7.4
billion noncomputer business.
</P>
<P>
   After those shares begin to trade, the stock market will
determine HP Classic's value. For example, if the IPO price is $15
a share and the shares fetch, say, $30 on the open market, bankers
will multiply $30 times the total number of HP Classic shares to
calculate the market value of HP Classic. (The new company's IPO
will offer only 15 percent of its total shares because the federal
government requires that these types of transactions keep initial
stakes below 20 percent in order to get tax-free status.)
</P>
<P>
   After HP Classic's value is established, investment bankers can
then determine how many HP Classic shares should be given to
Hewlett-Packard stockholders, who still own the remaining 85
percent of the newly created company.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of STREET05 (91318 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Once that step is taken, Hewlett-Packard will distribute the HP
Classic shares, and the test and measurement business finally
becomes an independent company.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, and usually in practice, the stock market should
value HP Classic and Hewlett-Packard shares at a combined price
that is greater than what HP fetched before the split.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, shareholders usually expect the separated
companies to perform better. For another, investors can focus on
the parts of the business that they really want to own, explains
Dresdner RCM Managing Director Walter Price Jr., a portfolio
manager of the firm's global technology mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as Hewlett-Packard became a global computing giant,
investors wanted to see consistent growth comparable to Dell or
IBM, when those stocks were humming. So, when the test business
reported (like it had from time to time) that the Asian flu was
going to cause a shortfall in earnings for the sector, shareholders
betting on computer growth weren't willing to ride out the T&AMP;M
storm, Price explains.
</P>
<P>
   Once the company completes its divestiture a year or so from
now, Hewlett-Packard should be a purer play on personal computers
and printers. Likewise, HP Classic should act more like its test
and measurement brethren.
</P>
<P>
   ``It attracts a different kind of investor,'' Price says.
</P>
<P>
   And it might even attract a decent return.

 Intel Plans To Acquire Level One  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Intel Corp. said yesterday it will buy Sacramento-based Level One
Communications for $2.2 billion in the biggest acquisition in its
31-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Level One makes chips for computer-networking equipment and will
give the Santa Clara chip giant another foothold in this
fast-growing market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is to be a major building-block supplier in all
aspects of this networking business,'' Intel chief executive Craig
Barrett said during a conference call. Right now, sluggish
computer-networking components are creating bottlenecks that
prevent computer chips from working as fast as they can. Intel
believes this is slowing sales of its core microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Intel hopes that if it becomes a major player in the
networking-chip business, it can help solve the bottleneck and also
prod others to work on it.
</P>
<P>
   Intel ``needs to invest in anything that might drive greater
microprocessor sales,'' said Drew Peck, an analyst with S.G. Cowen
and Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Intel recorded sales of $26 billion last year, but its earnings
actually fell 13 percent to $6.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Intel chips run 80 percent of the personal computers sold in the
United States today. With signs that PC sales might be slowing, and
with Advanced Micro Devices giving Intel vigorous competition in PC
chips, Intel is looking beyond the computer, into chips for
telephones and corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, growth was driven by the PC industry, but it's
clear that the telecommunications industry is going to drive the
semiconductor industry for the next decade,'' said Arun Veerappan,
an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   Level One, founded in 1985, employs 800 people and had 1998
revenues of $263 million. No layoffs are planned, and Level One
chief executive Robert Pepper will become an Intel vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Level One has been ``the Rodney Dangerfield of chip companies,''
said Kenneth Pearlman, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer. ``They've
been blowing the doors off their business,'' growing 68 percent
last year and 40 percent in 1997, but the company's stock price has
not reflected that success, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the stock swap, Intel will exchange 0.43 share of its stock
for every one of Level One's shares, essentially valuing Level One
at $48.75 per share.
</P>
<P>
   That's an 80 percent premium over Level One's closing price
yesterday of $27.13.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was announced after the market closed. Intel stock
closed at $113.38, down $1.31.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Intel closed a $185 million deal, announced in
October, to buy a Massachusetts networking company, Shiva Corp.
Earlier this year, Intel announced a joint venture with Analog
Devices Inc. to make chips for handheld computers.
</P>
<P>
   Peck, the S.G. Cowen analyst, said Intel has made hundreds of
investments in small companies to try to spur innovation.

MERRILL LYNCH GOES INTERNET, ALLOWS SOME CUSTOMERS TO BYPASS
BROKERS

 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the country's largest brokerage
house, dipped its toes into Internet stock trading Thursday night.
Now, it has to show it can swim.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening hours, Merrill's technicians switched on the
firm's long-awaited Internet trading option for a select group of
customers, allowing them for the first time to buy and sell listed
stocks without calling one of the firm's 15,000 brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill will soon give those clients the ability to invest in
mutual funds and to buy certificates of deposit as well as stocks.
And if the early foray goes well, Merrill plans to soon extend
online stock trading to more clients, including those who pay full
commissions to trade with Merrill, senior executives there said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's Internet offering is too limited _ and the fees
Merrill charges for its services too high _ to offer immediate
competition to the Internet stock brokerages that have begun luring
clients away from the established Wall Street firms. But Merrill's
main task is not to lure low-end customers away from online
brokerage firms, but to keep its own eight million clients, and
their $1.4 trillion in assets, on board.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to combine the advice from its full-service broker
with all-hours stock trading for clients who want to do it
themselves. Analysts are skeptical that the offering will quash the
anti-Internet image that has dogged Merrill recently, but Merrill
argues that it is changing perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to be the premier destination portal for financial
information and services,'' said John ``Launny'' Steffens, the vice
chairman in charge of the firm's brokerage force. ``But we also
offer the wisdom of a human being, and that's a winning strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors seem to agree. Word of the foray into online
trading combined with two recent upgrades on Merrill stock by Wall
Street analysts to give the firm's stock a big lift Thursday.
Merrill rose $6.6875 a share, or 8.6 percent, to $84.375, and
volume was double the daily average.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's stock had been under a dark cloud for months, in part
because it has been seen as doing less than other firms, including
leading competitors like Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, to come to
grips with how the Internet is changing financial services.
Steffens, himself a former retail broker, contributed to that
impression when he frowned on Internet stock trading in a speech
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The do-it-yourself model of investing, centered on Internet
trading, should be regarded as a serious threat to American
financial lives,'' he said then.
</P>
<P>
   Steffens says now that he intended to warn people against
hyperactive day trading, a caution that he says proved prescient
given the recent rise in concern from government regulators and
evidence that rapid turnover in stock portfolios can lead some
investors to financial ruin. What he did not mean, he said, was to
disparage the use of the Internet to trade stocks per se.
</P>
<P>
   But the original comments, and the subsequent clarification,
show the problem Merrill faces.
</P>
<P>
   It risks undermining its own network of brokers, who still make
most of their money from commissions linked to stock trading, by
rushing to offer services that compete with online rivals Charles
Schwab, E(STAR)Trade and others.
</P>
<P>
   But Merrill also faces the reality that the Internet caters not
only to trigger-happy day traders, but also to wealthy clients who
want to do at least some of their own stock trading for a fraction
of what Merrill charges for the same service.
</P>
<P>
   The market isn't waiting for Merrill to resolve the issue, says
Bill Doyle, director of online financial services for Forrester
Research. His company just surveyed nearly 100,000 people in North
America to learn more about their investing habits.
</P>
<P>
   Of the wealthiest segment of that group _ people with $750,000
or more in assets _ one in 10 already had begun trading stocks
through online brokerage houses, and a quarter of that number keep
most of their assets in online brokerage accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is serious money that's moving online,'' Doyle said.
``That's a big part of Merrill's decision. They can't stand back
any longer while assets are moving over.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The question confronting Merrill and every other Wall Street
brokerage firm is to what extent they are willing to sacrifice
retail stock trading commissions to make a bigger splash online.
Merrill's early online trading move does not address that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill has so far limited online trading to customers who have
at least $100,000 in assets with the firm and who choose to pay an
annual fee for managing their money, a fee that includes the cost
of trading stock for their accounts. Only 55,000 customer accounts
are in that category.
</P>
<P>
   But Steffens said that if early tests went well, Merrill would
extend the online service to more of its customers. He said a
decision on how much to expand the service would come soon,
possibly in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this goes well, we will be inclined to expand,'' he said.
``We could extend the offering across our customer accounts, and
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill brokers _ the firm calls them financial consultants _
are wary of the Internet because it could threaten their
livelihoods, Merrill executives acknowledge. But Steffens said
Merrill had long since grown past the point where commissions make
up a large percentage of its revenues _ they represented about 11
percent of its $17.5 billion in revenue last year _ and he said the
firm was prepared to compete on prices if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there going to be more pressure on prices? Yes,'' Steffens
said. ``Is there going to be more pressure on our sales force to
add more value? Double yes. But we are as convinced as ever that we
can help people and add significant value.''
</P>
<P>
   Cushioning the transition are signs that Merrill's retail
brokerage operation, while almost certainly facing some defections
to online rivals, is hardly bleeding. Quite the contrary, its
commission revenue is still growing. So is the number of accounts,
which rose by 40 percent last year and at a 30 percent annual rate
in the first two months of this year, during a boom in online
trading, Steffens said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Merrill's ability to compete with cut-rate, online
brokers will depend on how much investors are willing to pay for
investing services other than trading. That includes the advice
brokers give their clients and the stock research Merrill
investment bankers produce.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill recently extended, until the end of this month, a trial
in which it provides its stock research free online. The program
has been a success, people at the firm said, because it generated
130,000 new leads for Merrill brokers _ customers seen as
candidates to invest their money with Merrill. But the free
research also reiterates a persistent Internet theme: customers
often expect something for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But free research and the introduction of online trading at
least put Merrill firmly in the camp of full-service firms ready to
do battle on the Internet, says Steve Franco, an analyst with Piper
Jaffray Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have legitimized the channel after being very vocal
against it,'' Franco said. ``Longer term, they have to demonstrate
they can do as well there as they did in the old world.''

GENE STUDY BOLSTERS HOPE FOR TREATING DISEASES OF AGING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A gene that confers fountain-of-youth properties on human cells
grown in laboratory glassware has been tested in mice to see if its
absence will cause the opposite effect, that of premature aging.
The answer _ which is partly yes _ sustains but does not yet
fulfill the hope that manipulations of the gene will provide
treatments for cancer, heart disease and other maladies of aging
human tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Geron, the company that owns patents on the gene, said the new
result, reported in Friday's issue of Cell, bolstered its hopes for
deriving treatments from the gene. Other experts said the
experiment, although a well executed and necessary step toward
unraveling the mysteries of aging, was hard to interpret because of
the complexity of the subject and the early stage of research on
the gene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to create a great stir,'' Dr. Leonard Guarente, an
expert on aging at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said
of the experiment, noting that the altered mice grew gray hair but
did not show many other symptoms of human aging. ``It mirrors aging
in part, but not in whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The gene is one that makes the critical component of an enzyme
called telomerase.
</P>
<P>
   Research into the cellular basis of aging, long an intractable
field, was rejuvenated in January of last year when biologists
reported that human cells whose telomerase had been activated by
inserting extra copies of the gene kept dividing well beyond the
usual point _ some 50 divisions or so _ at which cells normally
stop dividing and die.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists refer to the cells as ``immortalized,'' because they
seem capable of dividing indefinitely while maintaining their
youthful appearance. In a progress report in December, the altered
cells were said to be still flourishing, with no sign of cancerous
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The reason telomerase has this effect in human cells is clear
enough. The chromosomes _ the units in which the cell's genetic
material is packaged _ are protected at either end with long
stretches of repetitive DNA called telomeres. Each time a normal
cell divides, the telomeres get shorter, as if marking off the
permissible number of divisions; when the telomeres reach a
critical minimum length, the cell starts to die.
</P>
<P>
   Though all cells possess the genes to make telomerase, the
enzyme that rebuilds shortened telomeres, in most cells the
critical telomerase gene is permanently switched off. This gene is
one that makes the template for the repeated DNA units of which
telomeres are composed.
</P>
<P>
   Only in egg and sperm cells, in special regenerative cells
called stem cells, and in cancer cells is the telomerase template
gene active.
</P>
<P>
   Immortalizing human cells is certainly an interesting feat, but
what does that mean for people? Does the shortening of the
telomeres with age, in fact, have anything to do with the aging of
the body as a whole?
</P>
<P>
   The experiment being reported Friday is the first effort to
answer the question as it applies to a whole organism, in this
case, mice. Dr. Ronald A. DePinho of the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston, along with colleagues there and at other
institutions, has worked with mice in which the critical telomerase
gene has been deleted from the genome.
</P>
<P>
   Mice, as it happens, have very long telomeres, and the first two
generations of mice that lacked the telomerase template gene were
unaffected by its lack.
</P>
<P>
   DePinho and his colleagues have now bred third- to
sixth-generation mice, with progressively shorter telomeres, and in
these mice, especially as they age, short telomeres are a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The third-generation mice developed gray hair, male pattern
baldness and erosive skin lesions considerably more often than
normal mice of the same age. The sixth generation mice that lacked
telomerase displayed these symptoms at an earlier age, going gray
at the age of 3 months.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the hearts, livers and kidneys of the mice
were normal, and they did not develop thinning of the bones or
cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   As to life span, the first to fifth generation mice that lacked
telomerase lived as long as normal mice, 50 percent of them living
for 24 months. Only in the sixth generation mice, with critically
short telomeres, was life span affected; half of these mice were
dead at 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious pattern in these results is that the tissues that
demand a steady proliferation of cells _ like skin and hair _ or
that need to regenerate under stresses _ like a wound healing _ are
the ones that are jeopardized by short telomeres.
</P>
<P>
   A second important finding is that the mice with short telomeres
have a higher incidence of cancer, suggesting that short telomeres
can destabilize the cell and initiate tumors.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is what relevance do these findings have to
aging and cancer in humans. On this point there is a wide range of
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Calvin B. Harley, Geron's chief scientific officer, said the
DePinho article was ``very exciting from our perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides strong support,'' Harley continued, ``for what
we've been saying all along for the promise of telomerase in
treating aging and cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Geron, which has financed several advances in the telomere
field, but not DePinho's present work, hopes to add the telomerase
gene to the cells of human tissues that have lost the capacity to
proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   Harley said the finding that short telomeres increase the risk
of cancer was ``a major new piece of data that may explain why the
frequency of cancer goes up in old age.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts are not ready to concede that the relevance of the
mouse results to human aging or cancer had been proved.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Weinberg, a cancer expert at the Whitehead Institute
in Boston, said the new report was ``very interesting'' and
``validated the notion that telomere integrity is essential for
cellular proliferation.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of proliferative capacity in telomere-deficient mice
could be the same process that occurs when human T-cells are
depleted in AIDS, but that and any other relation to human aging
remains to be proved, in Weinberg's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth,'' Weinberg said, ``is, I don't know how many other
aspects of human aging are or are not connected the telomere
shortening.''
</P>
<P>
   Guarente also said it was too early to say whether the
telomere-deficient mice are an accurate model for some or any of
the aging processes seen in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an extremely interesting study with possible relevance
to human aging,'' Guarente said, ``but we'll need a lot more
information before we can be certain of that relevance.''
</P>
<P>
   DePinho is also cautious about interpreting his findings, saying
telomere attrition is one component of aging, which, along with
other factors, affects the ability of an organism to withstand
acute stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``From these studies,'' he said, ``we've learned that if you can
maintain telomere function you are better able to maintain overall
fitness, so I think that is very good news. But we aren't going to
be erecting any Ponce de Leon fountains around Geron. It won't
reverse organismal aging as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   A difficulty in extending the findings from mice to people is
that mice evidently use the telomere system in a somewhat different
way. Mice have very long telomeres and presumably the mice that die
a natural death die from causes other than telomere shortening _
like oxidative damage, accumulating genetic errors and the other
kinds of wear and tear that probably play a role in human aging
too.
</P>
<P>
   With humans, telomeres are set much shorter, perhaps because
cancer is a far more serious danger for a long lived species. Human
telomeres are short enough that a proliferating tumor cell will run
out of telomeres before it gets to any significant size. Advanced
tumors must subvert this last ditch defense by activating
telomerase.
</P>
<P>
   But has evolution, in selecting the ideal limit for human
telomeres, had to make a trade-off between cancer prevention and
life span? In other words, do short telomeres ever limit human life
span by causing failure in aging tissues?
</P>
<P>
   Geron scientists and other experts believe human cells in the
aged do get critically short of telomeres, particularly when high
demands are put on the proliferative capacity of skin or
blood-forming cells.
</P>
<P>
   But biologists like Weinberg argue that no one has yet been
shown to have died of short telomeres, and that Geron's proposal to
activate telomerase in aging tissues could remove an important
defense against cancer.

BUDGET POLITICS IS DELAYING RELIEF FOR CENTRAL AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Texas, S.D., N.D., Ill., Iowa)  (js) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly $1 billion in emergency aid to
storm-stricken Central Americans ran afoul of partisan budget
politics in the House and Senate Thursday, dooming any chance that
President Clinton could deliver the relief package when he visits
the region next week.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in both houses were willing to approve the aid, but
only on conditions the president would find unacceptable _ cutting
an equal amount from programs like food stamps and welfare
assistance. The House Republicans disregarded pleas from their new
speaker that they go along with Clinton's plans without causing
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that the Republican majority is looking more to play
politics with some of the issues than in providing the very needed
aid,'' said the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, who denounced
the proposed cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee unanimously approved $1.9
billion in new spending, which included $956 million to help
countries like Honduras and Nicaragua rebuild after they were
devastated by storms last fall. It also contained $100 million in
aid to Jordan and $285 million in assistance for U.S. farmers and
ranchers hurt by the economic turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who heads the Appropriations
Committee, said the offsetting cuts came from programs that
received extra money last fall, which would not all be spent this
year. But he acknowledged that the cuts were politically sensitive
and might not survive a White House veto or negotiations with the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens and the Republican leadership are under strong pressure
from fiscal conservatives to stay under the self-imposed spending
caps, and not skirt the restrictions by giving the spending
emergency status as Congress often does in providing aid for
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   In another jab at the administration, the committee approved by
voice vote an amendment from Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, that
would bar the federal government from recouping any settlement
proceeds the states have negotiated with the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's five-year budget projections assume that the
federal government would receive $18.9 billion from the tobacco
settlements. Despite Thursday's vote, the committee was sharply
divided, foreshadowing a fierce floor battle.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Capitol, a meeting of the House Appropriations
Committee was canceled Thursday after Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, also under pressure from budget hawks as well as top
lieutenants like Tom DeLay and Dick Armey, both of Texas, ordered
the panel to find offsetting cuts in its budget to pay for the
Central American aid.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay and Armey, taken aback by the Senate seizing the
traditional House role of demanding fiscal responsibility, also
expressed anger that the government was willing to send millions to
storm victims in Latin America and the Caribbean, but shortchange
U.S. farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The House action dealt a setback to Hastert, who expected to
benefit along with Clinton from quick action on the emergency
foreign assistance. Hastert had not originally sought offsetting
cuts for that aid, although lawmakers had done so for the
assistance to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple fact is, a lot of our members want to be fiscally
responsible,'' said John Feehery, Hastert's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face illustrates the problems Republicans face as they
run into self-imposed budget restraints despite large projected
surpluses. It also shows the challenges Hastert confronts in
dealing with a six-vote House majority and rumblings that DeLay,
the minority whip, is calling the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats seized on the Republicans' decisions to portray a
Republican Party insensitive to the needs of the poor in this
country and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it puzzling that the offsets suggested by some of our
Republican colleagues would cut food stamps and welfare assistance
for the needy in this country to pay for assistance for the needy
in Honduras,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the committee Democrats voted for the bill, accepting
Stevens' explanation, as did Tom Harkin of Iowa, or vowing to fight
the cuts on the Senate floor or in House-Senate conference
committee, as did Byron Dorgan of North Dakota. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The proposed cuts from the current budget include $262 million
in food stamps, and $70 million in climate change and international
environmental programs. The bill also included $80 million to
provide new detention centers for Central American immigrants
fleeing their storm-ravaged countries. To pay for most of this, the
committee cut $65 million from border enforcement naturalization
programs.
</P>
<P>
   To win Democratic support, Stevens added $130 million in
agricultural aid to the original bill, and created a new program
for the steel industry that would guarantee up to $1 billion in
emergency loans.

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lake Buena Vista, Fla. _ Underneath the usual laid-back,
games-don't-count exterior, there are several forces driving the
Atlanta Braves during this exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   While spring training is mostly about getting in shape and ready
for the season, there are some important questions facing the
Braves as they move closer to Opening Day on April 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves open their Grapefruit League season today in
Kissimmee, Fla., where they'll play the Houston Astros at 1 p.m.
It's fitting that Atlanta will open with rookie Bruce Chen on the
mound, who is one of the three big question marks of this camp.
</P>
<P>
   Will Chen have a good camp, giving the Braves confidence that he
can be the No. 5 guy in the rotation? How will Ryan Klesko fare at
first base? And thirdly, how will the new hitters like Bret Boone,
Brian Jordan and Otis Nixon blend into this lineup?
</P>
<P>
   For this 31-game mini-season, starting with the Astros and
ending with the Indians at Turner Field on April 3, the answers
will come into focus, as will others like Mark Wohlers' comeback
bid, and which minor league players will eventually help this team.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost is seeing how Ryan Klesko does at first base.
He's been taking ground balls there for two weeks, getting in extra
defensive work with bench coach Bobby Dews, and reports success.
The Braves will gauge his progress before deciding their next, if
any, move.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting coach Don Baylor's emphasis with Klesko so far has been
on hitting left-handed pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to get used to seeing lefties again,'' said
Klesko, who only occasionally faced left-handers in the past
several years. ``Knowing what to look for.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen, meanwhile, has been ready for today's start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like the fact that I'm going to be pitching and it's
going to be soon,'' Chen said. ``It should be fun. You've been
working out the whole offseason, you want to see how you've
progressed.''
</P>
<P>
   This time last year Chen was in the habit of leaving pitches up
in the strike zone, something he could get away with in the minor
leagues. As a result, he surrendered four home runs in 10 2/3
innings last spring.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered he still had the same tendencies when he returned
to Atlanta last September, but he's spent the offseason working on
getting the ball down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and Denny Neagle throw down
to the knees every pitch,'' Chen said. ``If you're going to miss,
you have to miss low. My average pitch was four or five inches
higher than their average pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the number of eyes on him this spring, Chen said he won't
mind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be people watching,'' he said. ``That
doesn't bother me. I'm not playing for them. I'm playing for myself
and for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox plans to experiment with his lineup, given the
new additions to the team and the loss of Andres Galarraga.
Newcomer Otis Nixon is a primarily a leadoff man and Brian Jordan
is the logical choice to hit clean up, which leaves Boone as the
only wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Boone hit second on Thursday against Georgia Tech but could end
up hitting sixth, seventh or eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this lineup everybody's so good,'' Boone said. ``Coming off
a year when I drove in almost 100 runs, I can't hit third or
fourth, which is good. If I hit seventh, whatever ... Where you hit
in the lineup whether it's second, third, fourth, fifth or sixth,
in certain situations you've got a job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone, who's been traded twice in his career _ from Seattle to
Cincinnati and from the Reds to Atlanta _ said he's had no trouble
getting used to his new team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always an adjustment period you go through getting
used to the guys, but it's been easy,'' Boone said. ``There are so
many great players on this team. They all seem to be nice guys.
They go about their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting used to each other on the field will come naturally,
Boone figures. Boone figures preseason numbers are not important,
but he'd like to have a good spring anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to do well, it doesn't matter whether it's
whiffle ball or a practice game,'' Boone said. ``You want to get
your swing ready, get your legs ready defensively and hit the ball
hard. If you do that, you can have a good feeling going into the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of these questions, it's business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get everybody in shape, pick the best 25 and
get out of here healthy,'' Cox said.

 &HT;    Two Bautista HRs in 15-5 opening win
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ The Braves started their spring
training season with an offensive exhibition, putting up 15 runs on
Georgia Tech. That's the most the Braves have ever scored in
winning all nine spring games with the Yellow Jackets.
</P>
<P>
   The main attraction was Danny Bautista, who hit a pair of home
runs, one to straight-away center field and another that bounced
off the scoreboard in left center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you guys he's been swinging the bat better than anybody
against our live pitching,'' manager Bobby Cox said after the
Braves' 15-5 win. ``He's been the hitting star of the early camp.
He's been popping the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not Bautista's hottest start, though. He said he also
hit two runs to open spring training when he was playing for the
Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all you can have when you really work,'' said Bautista,
who is aiming for a roster spot as a bench player. ``I saw the ball
good today. What I was doing in the batting cages I tried to bring
to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves combined for 14 hits, three home runs, and two
doubles. Twenty different Braves got at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally we don't score much (this early),'' Cox said. ``Just
one of those days, you know. Glad to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   HUNTER ADAPTING
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter, who celebrated his 31st birthday on Thursday, got
his first action as a Brave since 1993 after signing two weeks ago
to back up Ryan Klesko at first base. Hunter went 0-for-2, scored a
run and showed the versatility that could help him make the team,
substituting in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who was 7-for-29 (.241) as a pinch hitter last year for
St. Louis, knows that will be his role as a Brave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I like to do, but I can do it,'' said
Hunter, who got some tips last year from Willie McGee, who's been
primarily a pinch hitter for the last three seasons. ``Willie
taught me how to get prepared. The worst thing you can do is be
surprised (when you're called upon).''
</P>
<P>
   WEISS BACK
</P>
<P>
   After being in bed for two days with strep throat, shortstop
Walt Weiss was back in the clubhouse reporting much better health
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My throat has never felt like that before,'' Weiss said. ``I
still feel a little bit light-headed but I'm fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss apparently caught it from his 4-year-old son Brody, who
had a serious bout with E. coli last summer that has left his
immune system weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss did not play in the game against Tech but did participate
in the morning's cutoff drills.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD NEWS FOR HELMS
</P>
<P>
   An MRI revealed minor league third baseman Wes Helms did not
have any tears in the rotator cuff of his throwing shoulder, which
has been giving him problems lately. ``It showed no tear, and
that's the important thing,'' trainer Dave Pursley said. Helms will
take at least three or four days off, and treat the shoulder with
anti-inflammatory medicine.

 &HT;    Interview ratings beat expectations
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Barbara Walters' interview with Monica Lewinsky was
the most-watched newsmagazine show in TV history, ABC News'
research department estimated Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 million people watched some or all of the two-hour
``20/20'' interview Wednesday night, according to ABC's analysis of
Nielsen Media Research figures. That doesn't quite elevate the
Lewinsky interview to the levels of a Super Bowl or a ``Seinfeld''
finale, but it is much higher than most analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, viewership was even higher than the national
average. About 50 percent of the TV sets in use in Atlanta were
tuned to the Lewinsky interview, according to Nielsen. That
compares with 34 percent that watched George Clooney's final
episode of ``ER'' two weeks ago.

ONE TOURNEY FITS CSUN'S BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While Cal State Northridge would have been
financially unable to host the Big Sky Conference men's basketball
tournament, there was no problem in hosting the women's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our responsibility to host the tournament and do it
right,'' interim athletic director Sam Jankovich said. ``We're
hoping the community gets behind it and we break even. This
community has the responsibility to come out and support that.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason Northridge can host the women's tourney, which began
Thursday night, is it costs less money to run it. Whereas the men's
contest costs the host institution $160,000, Northridge needs only
to spend about $12,000 for the women.
</P>
<P>
   The men's tournament host has to pay for the airfare, hotel
accommodations and per diem money of all six participants, plus the
officials. Northridge only has to take care of the officials, plus
any promotions it cares to arrange.
</P>
<P>
   The department is dipping into its $90,000 postseason budget to
pay for the tournament, said Grace Collins, the school's associate
athletic director/business.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN can make money on the tournament through ticket sales,
concession sales and corporate sponsors, but no one in the athletic
department expects a profit. Northridge finished last in the
conference in attendance, plus it's a long way for most of the
schools to come. Each participating school received 200 tickets;
only Portland State didn't return all 200. PSU returned 100,
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the returns, she said, was the schools were
confident tickets would be available for anyone making the trip.
Montana and Northern Arizona expected about 50 supporters each,
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Logistics: With a capacity of 1,600, Northridge plays in the
smallest building in the conference. The next smallest is Portland
State, at 1,775, but if PSU were to host the tournament, it could
move into the 12,884-seat Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   A small building means difficulty in televising Saturday's
tournament final, which Fox Sports will do. Sports information
director Ryan Finney said Fox will bring five cameras, one of which
gives a diagonal view of the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have room for it,'' Finney said. ``We'll probably
move it to a hand-held camera at center court.''
</P>
<P>
   The other four cameras will be in place: one above center court,
one above the baseline and one each behind the baskets.
</P>
<P>
   __ TV or not TV: What if they gave a final and no one saw it? If
Northridge reaches Saturday's final, it will be televised live on
Fox Sports Northwest at 5:05 p.m. Matador fans will have to wait
until 10 p.m. Saturday to see Fox Sports West 2's tape-delay
airing.
</P>
<P>
   __ Did you know?: The women's tournament has been held in the
state of Montana all but twice since its inception 11 seasons ago _
this year and 1992 in Boise, Idaho. . . . The conference champion
earns an automatic berth in the NCAA Tournament _ and likely a
14th, 15th or 16th seed. The conference is ranked 21st out of 26
conferences in winning percentage against the other conferences and
in strength of schedule. The team with the strongest schedule is
Weber State, at 179. Northridge is ranked 254.

DOW UP 191.52 AS IBM LEADS THE CHARGE  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After weeks of sour news on technology stocks, the
sector received a boost Thursday when IBM announced that it had won
a $16 billion order from Dell Computer for parts like disk drives
and displays.
</P>
<P>
   That news gave the broader market a lift after more than a week
of a general slide. But despite the 2 percent jump in the Dow Jones
industrial average and the 1.5 percent surge in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index, the market is still locked in the trading
range it has been in since January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are stuck in a trading range because we had prices get well
ahead of earnings,'' said Douglas R. Cliggott, U.S. equity
strategist at J.P. Morgan Securities. ``Values are stretched so far
it will be difficult for the market to make any headway unless
interest rates go down.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, long-term interest rates have jumped more than
half a percentage point despite the lowest inflation, according to
some measures, in more than 40 years. The reason for the rise has
been the refusal of the economy to slow down and the growing
concern among investors that the Federal Reserve will have to raise
rates to rein in growth.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's jobs report for February, investors will get a new
indication of how strong the economy still is and, in turn, a
signal on whether interest rates will keep rising. The consensus
estimate for nonfarm payroll job growth is 245,000.
</P>
<P>
   If the jobs report is stronger than expected, that will probably
send interest rates higher. That should put more pressure on stocks
because higher rates make their valuations more expensive. But
investors, at least for a day, may decide that stronger economic
growth will produce enough of a pop in earnings to overcome this
drag.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 191.52 points, to 9,467.40. It is 176 points below
the record it hit in January and is up only 1.4 percent since last
July, when last year's sell-off began. The S&AMP;P 500 climbed 18.94
points, to 1,246.64, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 27.69
points, or 1.22 percent, to 2,292.89. The Russell index of
smaller-company stocks finished up 2.07 points at 394.02. While the
three other major indexes are up slightly for the year, the Russell
is off 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the IBM announcement helped lift the broad market, its
effect on technology shares was less than might have been expected.
And that is because investors continue to have doubts about the
outlook after a series of announcements of earnings and sales
shortfalls from the likes of Dell, Micron Technology, Compaq
Computer and 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   Cliggott said that a report released Thursday showing that
factory orders increased 1.7 percent in January, to a seasonally
adjusted $349.6 billion, indicated that the growth trend for
semiconductors was still healthy. But the data also showed that the
growth rate for the personal computer and telecommunications
sectors was slowing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of IBM finished the day up 4\, to 171. But it was well
off its high of 177. Intel rose as high as 117~ in early trading
but fell in the afternoon, finishing down 1 5/16, to 113].

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Signaling that its future may depend as much on computer parts
as on entire machines, International Business Machines Corp. said
Thursday that it expected to sell $16 billion worth of disk drives
and other components to a rival, the Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   IBM claims to spend more on research and development than any
other technology company, and it is awarded the most patents of any
company in the world. But until recently, it hoarded its
discoveries for use in its own machines.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, it has been successful in selling
small, high-capacity disk drives for use in laptop computers. Its
PowerPC chip has been used extensively by Apple Computer for its
Macintosh family of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although components represent only 8 percent of IBM's $81.6
billion in annual sales, the business is growing at 40 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal helps legitimize IBM's claim they are a real
technology company,'' said Kevin McCarthy, an analyst with
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``Their R&AMP;D spending is starting to
pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dell, the deal promises discounts associated with a large
contract. Moreover, it gains an earlier window into IBM's research
efforts. Dell conducts little research of its own. It has grown by
efficiently assembling and distributing technology developed by the
Intel and Microsoft corporations and others. Dell will gain access
to IBM's vast portfolio of patents as part of the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said that Dell would purchase $16 billion worth of
parts over seven years, but that is based on a number of optimistic
assumptions. Dell's entire spending on components and other cost of
goods sold was $14 billion in 1998. Of that, only a few hundred
million was spent on disk drives from IBM. IBM told analysts that
the deal would not increase significantly its sales in the early
years of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   But executives of both companies said that toward the end of the
deal, Dell's purchases from IBM would grow rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may end up being IBM's biggest customer, which is kind of
eye opening,'' said Michael D. Lambert, a Dell senior vice
president. Still, he said that Dell was not bound to the $16
billion figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not locked in,'' he said. ``It's a best-efforts
arrangement. We said that if things go where we expect them, the
business ought to add up to $16 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors nonetheless took the deal as a positive sign. IBM's
shares rose by $4.25, to $171. Dell's shares increased by 93.75
cents, to $81.875.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly announcing such a long-term deal is unusual in the
fast-moving computer business, where manufacturers select
components for each new model based on what is available in the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   IBM executives say they are trying to escape such cyclical
beauty contests and forge the sort of long-term, high-level
relationships with manufacturers that it has long sought with
corporate computer users. Moreover, such a big announcement
represents an effort by IBM to attract attention to its components
business.
</P>
<P>
   For Dell, Lambert said that committing to such a big contract
was necessary because IBM and Dell were such long-term adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a strong signal internally that we can talk about the
future in collaborative terms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts wondered if IBM hoped to forge deeper ties with Dell.
IBM's rapidly growing Global Services unit would love to offer
installation and maintenance services for Dell's customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts wonder whether IBM might outsource some or all of
its computer manufacturing business to Dell as part of a broader
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM still insists they are committed to the PC business,''
McCarthy said. ``But longer term, they may want out, and Dell could
be a bigger partner.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth in IBM's components business came as its personal
computer business foundered. It lost ground to low-cost machines
from Compaq that won the consumer market, and Dell's lean
direct-sales approach won huge gains among IBM's traditional
corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   IBM found it had less competition and higher margins selling
components. It says it earns more profit from an Apple Powerbook _
equipped with a disk, display screen and PowerPC chip from IBM _
than Apple earns.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, executives of the company's computer system units
initially objected to selling the most advanced technology to
rivals. But ultimately, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., IBM's chairman, made
it clear that each division would have to compete on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, IBM consolidated its component businesses,
including disks, chips, printers and networking equipment, in one
division run by James T. Vanderslice, who had run the successful
disk business. One of his first sales calls was on Dell.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's competitors in the disk drive market played down the
effect of the deal on their sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing for us should change,'' said Phil Montero, a spokesman
for Seagate Technology. ``Dell has always had more than one
supplier.'' He said that just under 5 percent of Seagate's sales,
or $340 million, were to Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Seagate's stock fell by $1.625 Thursday to $28.

in Internet commerce systems, the company Thursday offered Biztalk,
a new language, or a set of conventions, that it said would help
draw together disparate business practices and electronic commerce
technologies via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is the ultimate market,'' said Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman and chief executive. ``It's great news for
businesses because they can reach out to more customers than ever
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The new approach will offer businesses the ability to configure
electronic systems for retail or business-to-business commerce in a
``Lego block'' approach, Microsoft executives said.
</P>
<P>
   But they did not announce specific product availability dates or
prices, saying only that they would be available shortly after the
company's much-delayed Windows 2000 operating system, the successor
to Windows NT, which is scheduled to be released before the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also announced Commerce Server version 3.0, a software
program designed for Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its new initiative, Microsoft also announced a
variety of new business partnerships and the acquisition of
Comparenet, a comparison-shopping Web site that it intends to
integrate into its MSN Web portal.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is trying to turn MSN into a marketplace by offering
services that will make it easier for small businesses to build an
online store.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said that although Microsoft was late and
trailed competitors like IBM in the electronic commerce space, the
software company's new strategy appeared to be a systematic
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely late; it's a me-too strategy compared to
companies like Yahoo and America Online,'' said Michael Putnam, a
business and technology analyst at Forrester Research Inc., a
market research firm in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the strategy was a good one but suggested that
Microsoft might run into resistance from competitors and from its
own customers and business partners in its attempt to evangelize a
broad standard with the Biztalk language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Biztalk is a good thing,'' he said. ``Standards
are critical for the growth of Internet commerce, but this is like
General Motors making the traffic rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives predicted Thursday that the accelerating
pace of electronic commerce shortly would begin to transform some
products that have been sold as physical objects into digital
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of products that today are in physical form will become
digital,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts were skeptical that Microsoft would be able to
achieve meaningful dominance in electronic commerce markets,
because it will have difficulty harnessing broadly used Internet
standards to its proprietary software.
</P>
<P>
   The company has chosen to build its Biztalk ``framework'' around
an industry Web standard known as XML, which is being used to
connect data bases to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not using industry-standard XML, they're out of
luck,'' said Kimball Brown, a computer industry analyst at
Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif., market research firm. ``Microsoft is
going to have to play by industry rules.''

ZEDILLO SUGGESTS U.S.-STYLE SYSTEM TO PICK PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL
NOMINEE

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico urged his
governing party on Thursday to break with 60 years of authoritarian
tradition and elect its presidential candidate this year through a
series of state primaries culminating in an American-style party
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's proposal to 1,800 government officials and party
leaders, which drew an extended standing ovation, was technically
only a recommendation. But officials of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, said there was little doubt
that the party would follow Zedillo's suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   The system he outlined would end the uniquely Mexican tradition
known as the dedazo _ literally, the ``fingering'' of candidates _
under which the 10 PRI presidents who preceded Zedillo all
hand-picked their own successors. But the president also said on
Thursday that he still intended to play a powerful role in the
party's candidate selection, leading several analysts to conclude
that the innovations he has in mind may be more of form than of
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo previously pledged in interviews that he would not
choose the PRI's candidate this year and had expressed admiration
for American-style primaries. But not until Thursday had he begun
to sketch out the procedures of the candidate-selection scheme he
wants the PRI to adopt. And it is not clear how closely the
American and Mexican systems might resemble each other.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system that he outlined, successive local primaries
would result in the election of delegates, who would later meet
representatives of the PRI labor, peasant and other wings to select
the presidential candidate. Many aspects of the system are unclear,
including whether the delegates would be committed to individual
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reiterate today with absolute clarity that I will not
designate the PRI candidate,'' Zedillo said in a speech
commemorating the 70th anniversary of the party's founding in 1929.
``Our selection process should use the popular secret vote of our
active members and of all citizens who lean toward our party.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior aide to Zedillo said after the president's speech that
many elements of the candidate selection process under
consideration have been modeled on the U.S. model.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be very much the American way,'' the aide said. But
it is too soon to see how much the two systems might resemble each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's speech at party headquarters drew thunderous ovations
from the party's top leadership but also some grumbling, outside
the auditorium, from party gadflies who said his proposals were
less democratic than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   More than his predecessors, Zedillo is a democrat by conviction,
but his proposals appear motivated as much by tactical necessity as
by idealistic principles. The use of the dedazo has opened deep
party fissures before every election since the 1970s, as powerful
politicians passed over for the nomination have nursed their anger
in political feuds. A man spurned for the nomination in 1987,
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, defected from the PRI to form an
opposition party that is today the PRI's most dangerous rival.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, several analysts said, Zedillo believes that if the
party organizes primaries in which not only PRI members, but all
Mexican voters, are encouraged to participate, his own preferred
candidates will probably prevail over hard-line party
traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo drew sustained applause by criticizing several leaders
of the traditionalist wing, known as the dinosaurs, who have
already announced their own candidacies. He chided them for
threatening party unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comrades, besides democracy, we need unity, a lot of unity, to
win in 2000,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's address appeared to be Zedillo's most vigorous use to
date of his own influence to mold events within his party, from
which he once pledged to maintain a ``healthy distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, even as Zedillo voluntarily pledged to give up
the Mexican presidency's greatest power, the unilateral choice of a
successor, he vowed to use his powers in the PRI's internal
deliberations more forcefully than at any previous time. He is in
the fifth year of his six-year term and is ineligible to seek
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have every right and complete moral and political authority
to express my opinions about the process by which our party will
select its presidential candidate,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who use my pledge not to designate the candidate to say
that this in a process in which I won't get involved, in which I'll
be indifferent or standoffish, are mistaken,'' Zedillo said.
Hundreds of party leaders, apparently impatient with Zedillo's
previous hesitancy about directly involving himself in party
affairs, gave that line sustained applause.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Agustin Basave, a former PRI congressman who last year helped
found a caucus that has been pressing party leaders to allow the
rank and file to organize the candidate nomination process, said
Zedillo's proposals could give him tremendous power to influence
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president did today was smack his hand on the
table,'' Basave said. ``He said, `I'm the boss of the PRI and I'm
going to exercise my power in the party. I'll not designate the
candidate, but I'll set the rules and serve as referee. Well, the
line separating the referee from the guy who picks the candidate is
very thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Bartlett, a former interior minister who is a leader of
the PRI's dinosaur wing and has declared himself a candidate for
the nomination, praised the president's decision to end the dedazo
tradition. But he reserved final judgment on the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of details are still not spelled out,'' Bartlett said in
an interview. ``How and who will organize these state elections?
How will they count the votes? These are some of the things that
must still be defined, and party members should help set these
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Zarate, who edits a political newsletter here, said
Zedillo's speech ``makes it clear that the president intends to
keep tight control of the succession process.
</P>
<P>
   ``He laid out the party line in the orthodox way Mexican
presidents have been doing this for 60 years,'' Zarate said.
</P>
<P>
   A PRI official said party officials would circulate Zedillo's
proposals for internal debate in coming weeks before approving the
final candidate selection procedures in May. The PRI's top leader,
Mariano Palacios Alcocer, said in an interview this week that the
party will select its candidate by mid-November.

MONITOR CHIEF CALLS KOSOVO CLOSE TO FLARE-UP

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The senior general in charge of
international monitors in Kosovo warned Thursday that the troubled
province was perilously close to a major conflagration, as two
separate incidents in the province nearly flared into violence.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 Serbian policemen lined up their armored vehicles
threatening to storm a village after two Serbian brothers were
killed in northern Kosovo. In another area, the Serbian police said
they would run an armed patrol deep into territory controlled by
Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas, who in turn threatened to fire
on them.
</P>
<P>
   Unarmed international monitors tried to get the two sides to
step back from confrontation in each area, but by evening the
standoffs continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has got pretty serious,'' said Maj. Gen. John
Drewienkiewicz, the British chief of operations of the Kosovo
Verification Mission, run by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to insure compliance with a cease-fire here.
The monitors could not carry on forever, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think we can stagger on with this mission
indefinitely because we had difficulties in December, and it has
been getting steadily worse,'' he said in an interview. ``The place
is hugely volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army now has 15 companies out of their barracks,
conducting operations around Kosovo, setting up scattered camps in
villages and fields, in broad violation of the cease-fire accord
signed in October.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement, brokered by a U.S. envoy, Richard Holbrooke,
with the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, allows for only
three companies, or about 400 troops, to be out at any one time.
There are nearly 2,000 Serbian troops on the move in Kosovo now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you keep pouring people out of their barracks, something is
going to happen,'' Drewienkiewicz said. ``If you slop petrol all
over the floor, eventually someone comes in and stubs a cigarette
out in it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said scattered camps of Serbian forces and the ethnic
Albanian guerrillas were ``all on alert, all ready to move and not
ready to be the first to step back.''
</P>
<P>
   Drewienkiewicz, who introduces himself as ``General DZ,'' said
the situation was not so bad that he feared for the safety of the
1,300 monitors in Kosovo, but he said only an international
military force could do the job now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not verifying a cease-fire,'' he said. ``We are hanging
on to a cease-fire and negotiating its reconstitution by the
minute.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Every day the monitors have to wade through rumor and
counterrumor to establish who started a clash and why.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army and the Serbian police often use their heavy
firepower to respond to a killing or ambush, resulting in hundreds
of villagers' fleeing their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas are reacting to the large concentrations of
Serbian forces by reinforcing positions and performing hit-and-run
ambushes and shootings. Several policemen have been killed in the
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Drewienkiewicz said that the Kosovo Liberation Army issued
instructions to its men this week to refrain from such attacks and
that the warning seemed to be having some effect. But Serbian
forces appear to be ignoring the remonstrations of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The primary aim of the Serbian military activity is not clear,
but observers are concerned the Yugoslav army may be preparing a
major offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The operations around the border are evidently to guard the
country against the supposed NATO threat, Drewienkiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 troops of a NATO extraction force are based over
Kosovo's southern border, in Macedonia. They are on hand to rescue
the monitors if needed but may form the vanguard of the
international military peacekeeping force that will enforce any
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are there, with a lot of heavy metal, and the Serbs must
be aware of it,'' the general said. Serbian forces have wired with
explosives several bridges and tunnels on the Kosovo border,
apparently in preparation for a NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   They have also massed large numbers of tanks and armor mounted
with anti-aircraft guns in the border region, clearing many
villages of their inhabitants in the process.

RUSSELL STOVER BUYS PANGBURN'S NAME, TRADEMARKS, INVENTORY

<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Pangburn Candy Co., which traces its roots back 85
years in Fort Worth, was unceremoniously put to rest Thursday in a
bankruptcy court auction that attracted winning bids of $4.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   The brand name and its flagship pecan patties will survive as
part of the Russell Stover Candies empire. But the company's Fort
Worth factory will close, throwing several dozen employees out of
work.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded in 1914 at H.T. Pangburn's downtown Fort
Worth drugstore, filed for bankruptcy Feb. 1 after two consecutive
years of losses.
</P>
<P>
   Its fate was sealed Thursday morning in a dingy basement room at
the federal courthouse. Fifteen registered bidders took less than
90 minutes to conclude the auction.
</P>
<P>
   Pangburn employees are expected to be told Friday that they will
lose their jobs, workers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company has laid off many of its 100 full-time workers in
the past two weeks, operating its plant at 2000 White Settlement
Road with a skeleton crew, employees said.
</P>
<P>
   Pangburn officials did not return requests for comment Thursday.
The company has been owned by an investment group headed by Jim
Phillips, a Fort Worth lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Stover, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., made the
only winning bids at the auction through its Whitman's Candies
affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   The first bid, for $4 million, won the rights to the Pangburn
name and trademarks, including the popular Millionaire$. A second
bid, for $500,000, won the company's inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Both were swiftly approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Massie
Tillman, and Russell Stover said it plans to complete the deal
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan on manufacturing the Pangburn products out of our new
plant in Corsicana,'' said Scott Ward, co-president of Russell
Stover. He said it should take four to five months to transfer
production to the Corsicana factory, a $35 million,
450,000-square-foot facility that started making candy just last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Ward invited idled Pangburn factory workers to interview for
positions at the plant, which is expected to employ 600 within a
year. About 120 people work now in Corsicana, Russell Stover's
eighth U.S. production site.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Stover is the nation's third-largest chocolate maker,
behind industry giants Hershey's and M&AMP;M Mars. It is the No. 1
seller of boxed chocolates, with sales of more than $500 million,
Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one bidder, Maxfield Candy Co. of Salt Lake City, offered
to buy all of Pangburn's assets, including the equipment and
accounts receivable. President Taz Murray bid $4.5 million but
would go no higher, citing Pangburn's unprofitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to offer what we felt it was worth,'' Murray said. He
acknowledged that his price was far less than the company's
valuation of about $17 million as of Dec. 31. But ``an asset is
only worth what it produces in income,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Gay, president of DFG Confectionery of Fort Worth, also
wanted to bid for the entire company. DFG acquired the Sweet Shop
last year and wanted to consolidate Pangburn with its operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, by the time you added up the sum of the parts,
it was $6 million-plus, and that was too much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Russell Stover made a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They paid a good price for what they got,'' he said. ``They're
growing, and Pangburn fits in nicely with what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidders offered about $500,000 for the equipment and accounts
receivable. But when Pangburn's lawyer, Mark Petrocchi, said the
company wants at least $1.5 million for those assets, his remark
drew only silence. The company will continue efforts to sell those
assets.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank Dallas, Pangburn's only secured creditor, has first
call on proceeds from the asset sales.
</P>
<P>
   Between Russell Stover's $4.5 million, cash in the company's
bank accounts and other sale proceeds, the bank should reclaim its
nearly $7 million in outstanding loans, said John Penn, a lawyer in
the Fort Worth office of Haynes &AMP; Boone.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's lackluster bidding bodes ill for Pangburn's
unsecured creditors, who lack collateral for their more than $3
million in claims.
</P>
<P>
   The largest unsecured creditor, Gonzales Labor Systems of
Arlington, is owed about $250,000 for providing temporary workers.
Owner Cruz Gonzales said Thursday that Pangburn was not his largest
customer but represented about 8 percent of his billings.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Prostok, a Fort Worth lawyer with Cantey &AMP; Hanger and
representative for the unsecured creditors, said he hopes to
recover 50 cents on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from Thursday's bidding was Peggie Muir, former chief
financial officer of Pangburn. She left the company about two years
ago and founded Mrs. Burden's Gourmet Candy Co. in Fort Worth. Muir
had said she wanted to combine the two operations, keeping Pangburn
in town.
</P>
<P>
   She rounded up financial backers that would have supported a bid
of at least $5 million but said she couldn't negotiate a break on
the $516,000 annual rent on Pangburn's production plant. The
facility is owned by an investment group that, until July, owned
part of Pangburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I could have made it work, except we couldn't get
comfortable with the lease,'' Muir said. ``That's when my money
went away. Nobody wants to throw $5 million or $6 million into a
bucket with a hole in the bottom.''

<P>
   LOD, Israel _ As airline employees cheered, the shiny Boeing
737, a blue Star of David freshly emblazoned on its tail, touched
down at Ben Gurion International Airport here, the first of eight
new Boeing jets that El Al, the Israeli international flag carrier,
is acquiring this year.
</P>
<P>
   This $600 million fleet upgrade, the biggest aircraft investment
in El Al's history, is the most visible and costly part of a
campaign to prepare the airline to sell stock to private investors
as early as April. With a redesigned logo, chic new uniforms and an
income statement modestly in the black after recurring
state-subsidized losses, El Al is trying hard to become what Tom
Schick, executive vice president at Boeing, called in a visit here
``a new, aggressive and customer-focused airline.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Israel itself, El Al is 50 years old, proud of a pioneering
past and a proven ability to survive, even thrive, in adversity.
Also like Israel, the airline must cope with deep divisions, both
political and cultural, as it strives to compete as an equal in the
world market, without compromising its security or special national
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Private ownership and private management are the keys to El Al's
economic future, its executives say, taking their cue from dozens
of other state airlines that have been converted into commercial
enterprises in recent years. But El Al Israel Airlines Ltd. is no
ordinary airline, and selling it is no ordinary marketing
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Its history as a terrorist target has made it perhaps the most
security-conscious carrier in the world. Every flight has its own
undercover armed guard. Nearly every pilot is a former Israeli Air
Force officer.
</P>
<P>
   At home and abroad, baggage inspections and pre-flight security
checks are carried out in deadly earnest, with the company's own
state-of-the-art equipment and specially trained personnel.
Aircraft like the new 737s are fitted at company hangars with
classified Israeli security hardware.
</P>
<P>
   All this adds $70 million to $100 million a year to operating
costs, El Al officials say. That is a daunting sum for a company
that generates about $1.2 billion in annual revenues. Under state
ownership, about two-thirds of this expense has been absorbed by
Israeli security agencies, but the government and El Al management
are now debating how these costs should be shared, and calculated,
once El Al is no longer wholly owned by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This comes with a price tag,'' said Joseph Ciechanover, the
chairman of El Al, ``and the costs and the responsibility for the
costs must be stated clearly, up front, in the prospectus.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with the rest of its planes, El Al cannot fly its
expensive new Boeing jetliners from Friday evening to Saturday
night, or on eight other sundown-to-sundown Jewish holidays. The
Sabbath restriction was imposed in 1982 when the rightist
government of Menachem Begin wrested control of the ailing company
from its union.
</P>
<P>
   The company was restructured as the designated national carrier,
with a pared-down work force and a guaranteed monopoly on
international air freight and scheduled passenger flights.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping its fleet grounded on the Sabbath costs the company some
$36 million yearly in potential net earnings, according to a study
conducted for El Al three years ago by the Boston Consulting Group.
That is a make-or-break figure for a company that posted losses of
$83 million in 1996 and $4 million in 1997, before turning a profit
in 1998 that was estimated at $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sabbath is more than 24 hours,'' Ciechanover said in an
interview at the company's utilitarian headquarters at Ben Gurion
airport. ``Take our flights to New York. We fly overnight Thursday,
land early Friday morning and stay there on the ground until late
Saturday night. That is 20 percent of our workweek.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Jewish state,'' he continued, ``and it is
understandably important to many people that the designated
national carrier be respectful of the Sabbath. But the cost is very
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that cost is an inability to compete at all in critical
weekend tourist traffic. In a society with a six-day workweek,
flights on Friday nights or Saturdays are the first preference of
the secular vacationer. Foreign airlines now offer more than 80
regularly scheduled international flights to and from Ben Gurion on
Saturday alone. Small private domestic airlines, not bound by
Sabbath strictures, do a busy weekend resort trade.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, having
promised to privatize the airline when it came to power two and a
half years ago, is now scrambling to sell 49 percent of the company
on the Tel Aviv stock exchange before the next national elections
on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   But some officials say the sale, which analysts estimate will
set a market value for the airline of as much as $250 million, may
be delayed until after an expected runoff election on June 1 for
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The government has backed away from longstanding plans favored
by management to sell majority control to private investors,
including a big international airline as a strategic partner. The
Netanyahu government also shelved plans to put El Al's initial
stock offering on the market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very much for floating shares abroad,'' Ciechanover said.
``Markets in New York would be better than Tel Aviv at evaluating
an airline company. But it's better to get this process going. Once
it starts, it won't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Other disputes, though, must still be resolved before the stock
offering can proceed. The government and El Al's board are
squabbling over how to divide the $100 million or more they expect
to reap from the stock sale. The airline, unsurprisingly, thinks it
should keep the money, while the government says the earnings
should go to the public treasury.
</P>
<P>
   There is also disagreement with the union about how much of the
stock will be offered at a discount to El Al workers. The
government wants to limit it to 10 percent; employees want more.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensitive question, of course, is how much leeway
private management will have over what has been considered an
invaluable public asset.
</P>
<P>
   Many of El Al's far-flung international routes were established
more for strategic than commercial reasons, as Israel sought to
expand transportation and diplomatic links in defiance of terrorist
threats and Arab-led boycotts.
</P>
<P>
   Its fleet still serves as a kind of civilian air reserve, on
call to be pressed into service in times of war or national
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Its passenger aircraft are commandeered for airlifts, often in
situations of great risk. For example, El Al flew thousands of
Ethiopian Jews to Israel in just 24 hours in 1991, when Addis Ababa
was aflame with civil war.
</P>
<P>
   And special El Al night flights bringing hundreds of thousands
of immigrants from the former Soviet Union continued throughout the
Persian Gulf war, even as Iraq was lobbing missiles at Israel and
other airlines suspended flights to the region. ``We were flying
around the clock,'' said Nachman Klieman, the El Al spokesman. ``It
took quite a toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Would a privatized El Al remain available for such patriotic
duties? Management says yes, but not on the same essentially
cost-free terms. And it would expect other private airlines here to
do the same.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, El Al cargo planes routinely haul classified
materiel for the Defense Ministry and other state agencies. After
an El Al 747 carrying chemicals ordered by a top-secret government
research lab crashed in October 1992 after takeoff from Amsterdam's
airport and killed 43 people, the airline said little for almost
five years amid contentions that the shipment was intended for the
manufacture of nerve gas _ and the cause of health problems
reported by residents of the neighborhood where the plane fell.
</P>
<P>
   El Al officials, saying the airline is fully insured against any
potential liability from local Dutch lawsuits. have since
acknowledged that the plane was carrying dimethyl methyphosphonate,
which can be used in making the nerve gas Sarin. Israeli officials
said it was destined for use in tests of gas mask filters.
</P>
<P>
   El Al's privatization was officially endorsed in 1995 by a Labor
government, which received union blessing to divest itself of a
majority of its holdings. When Netanyahu became prime minister in
1996, the government promised to make the sale a centerpiece of a
broader privatization program.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a commission recommended a 100 percent divestiture,
while El Al's management assiduously courted American Airlines as a
potential equity partner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet concern among Orthodox Jews that private owners would
overturn the ban on flights during the Sabbath _ known in Hebrew as
Shabbat _ led the government to cap the planned stock sale at 49
percent. No single investor will be entitled to buy more than 5
percent of the company, discouraging many prospective foreign
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not easy to sell El Al, especially because of the
problem of Shabbat,'' said Moshe Leon, Netanyahu's chief economic
adviser. ``But it must be done, and it will be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a change in the Sabbath policy, the financial turnaround
that was achieved last year could prove ephemeral, El Al officials
say. Most of El Al's 1998 profit margin came from record-low fuel
prices and unexpected local savings from the devaluation of the
shekel last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The company is braced for more competition from foreign airlines
_ Continental is inaugurating daily service here from Newark in
August _ and from domestic cargo carriers, which are petitioning
for regular international air freight routes.
</P>
<P>
   In response, El Al's union has taken the government to court to
block air cargo competition unless El Al is allowed to fly freight
on the Sabbath as well. With cargo accounting for a quarter of El
Al's revenue, the loss of the freight monopoly coupled with the
continued Sabbath restriction could doom the company, the union
argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the complexity of this country, where religion gets
mixed up with the state,'' said Michael Kovachi, the chief El Al
union representative. ``What Hamas and El Fatah didn't manage to
do, the religious have done, lowering the flags on the tails of our
planes.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to deregulate the air cargo business is now in the
hands of Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom. As a leader of the
small National Religious Party, he must balance the demands of his
devout Orthodox constituency against his avowed free-market
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Yahalom accuses El Al of ``hiding behind its workers'' in the
lawsuit and trying ``to torpedo moves that are aimed only at
creating true competition and lowering prices for the benefit of
the public.'' But he has continued delaying an expected ruling in
favor of freight deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   A paradox in the court battle is that a private local company,
Cargo Air Lines, is already flying as many as seven freight flights
out of Israel every Sabbath _ using leased El Al planes with
moonlighting El Al crews.
</P>
<P>
   In an arrangement winked at by the government since 1982, these
Friday and Saturday freight flights help amortize the costs of El
Al's equipment while insuring that cut flowers and perishable
produce reach weekend markets in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   El Al's local competitors have joined the call for the Sabbath
ban to be lifted, but only as part of a broader deregulation of the
industry. ``El Al must be released from this limitation if they
want to privatize,'' said Michael Weinstein, the chief executive
officer of Aeroel, an Israeli company that runs foreign charter
flights on Fridays and Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market will adjust itself,'' Weinstein said. ``El Al will
continue to be the leader, because of its routes, but it may cut
back on flights that are not so profitable. Competition will make
El Al better.''

 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using information once jealously guarded by oil and gas
companies, scientists have for the first time identified a major
fault under downtown Los Angeles of a kind whose existence there
they previously could only infer. They say it is capable of
producing a devastating earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have for years believed that such faults, called
blind thrusts, exist beneath the city. But this is the first solid
proof that one is actually present, said Dr. James Dolan, a
professor of geology at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The research adds support to the theory, emerging in the last
decade, that Los Angeles is threatened more by faults like this
one, which lie concealed underground right inside the city, than by
the famous and much larger San Andreas fault, a visible scar
running across the landscape 60 miles east of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many blind thrust faults might lie beneath Los
Angeles, experts said on Thursday that they did not know. But Dolan
said there was unlikely to be another the size of the newly
identified one, which would measure 250 square miles on the surface
and is believed to be at least nine miles deep.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``the poster child of blind thrust faults underneath Los
Angeles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, who was not among the researchers, said they had ``nailed
its location'' and determined that it was under increasing strain.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Henyey, co-director of the Southern California
Earthquake Center, a consortium of academic and government
institutions with headquarters at the University of Southern
California, said the finding would add to the data that scientists
and policy makers consider in evaluating building codes and the
design of crucial complexes like hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The fault was identified by Dr. John Shaw, a structural
geologist at Harvard University, and Dr. Peter Shearer, a
seismologist at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in San Diego.
Their work is described in Friday's issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Thrust faults, which exist elsewhere and have long been thought
to lie beneath Los Angeles, in part because of surface features
that occur within the city, are given their name because of the
activity they induce in earthquakes. In a quake caused by what is
called a slip-strike fault, like the San Andreas, the blocks of
earth slide past each other horizontally. But in a quake caused by
a thrust fault, whose fracture of the earth dips along at angles
that can be either shallow or steep, the blocks move diagonally,
almost vertically.
</P>
<P>
   Such movement may cause rocks to fold just below the surface. Or
it may create small hills on the surface. But that evidence of a
quake can easily erode away or be bulldozed to make room for
apartment buildings, leaving the fault invisible, or ``blind.''
</P>
<P>
   The blind thrust faults of Los Angeles, Shaw explained, are
caused by the relative motion of the North American and Pacific
plates, two huge masses of crust that are sliding past each other
along the San Andreas fault. Because of a dogleg in the fault, the
Los Angeles basin is being squeezed like an accordion between these
masses of earth. The ground under the city is compressing by a
fifth of an inch a year, Shaw said, and some of that stress is
building up on one fault or another somewhere out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign that the Los Angeles basin had potentially
dangerous blind thrust faults came in 1987 with the Whittier
Narrows earthquake, a magnitude-6 temblor on the Richter scale,
that killed eight people and caused property damage of $358
million. No fault had been mapped in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude-6.7 Northridge earthquake of 1994, also on a blind
thrust fault that had not been mapped, killed 33 people and caused
damage worth $35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But when scientists began looking for blind thrust faults, they
could only infer their existence from folds in sand and gravel
layers near the surface, Dolan said. The largest of these earlier
inferred faults is called the Elysian Park fault, which like the
newly identified one, apparently lies under parts of downtown Los
Angeles. But its actual size is not known.
</P>
<P>
   To find blind faults, Shaw said, scientists must identify
geologic structures underground, a task with which the oil and gas
industry is quite familiar. Petroleum companies have been drilling
and exploring in the Los Angeles basin for decades, seeking pockets
of oil and gas. The methods they use can also be employed to gain
evidence of faults: setting off small explosions on the surface and
measuring the way sound waves propagate through the ground or
measuring the velocity of sound in rocks during drilling.
</P>
<P>
   The oil and gas companies long kept their findings secret,
however, regarding them as highly proprietary.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaw, who once worked for Texaco as a petroleum geologist,
said major petroleum companies were now pulling out of Los Angeles
because of strict environmental regulations and the depletion of
oil and gas there. The companies are now willing to turn their old
data over to researchers, he said, in return for improved
techniques that will help them search for oil and gas elsewhere,
using new data.
</P>
<P>
   It was oil company information, Shaw said, that led to the
discovery of the newly identified fault, called the Puente Hills
blind thrust because it lies along the Puente Hills near the town
of Whittier, in Orange County. The fracture, he said, showed up
clearly on 10 seismic profiles _ so clearly, in fact, that
distinctive characteristics could be discerned on each side of the
fault.
</P>
<P>
   The fault runs east-west for about 25 miles from Century City to
Coyote Hills in northern Orange County. If it came to the surface,
it would be about 10 miles wide. Underground, the entire fault dips
at about 27 degrees to the north and appears to form three distinct
segments, termed Los Angeles, Santa Fe Springs and Coyote Hills.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fault is active. Using new techniques for calibrating the
epicenter of past earthquakes and oil company data on sound
velocities, Shearer discovered that the Whittier Narrows earthquake
was caused by the Puente Hills fault. Moreover, the earthquake
ruptured only 10 percent of the blocks on that segment of the
fault, which means that the quake probably left a great deal of
stress on the immediate segment and adjoining segments.
</P>
<P>
   Each fault segment is capable of generating a Northridge-size
earthquake, Shaw said. If all three segments ruptured
simultaneously, a much more damaging, magnitude 7 earthquake could
occur.
</P>
<P>
   The record of prehistoric ruptures on the Puente Hills fault is
not known. Each segment could break every 250 to 1,000 years and a
triple whammy might happen once every 500 to 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   No large earthquake has occurred within the Los Angeles basin
since 1850, when European settlers first began to keep records.

AFTER LULL TO GAUGE DAMAGE, BRITISH JETS HIT IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a lull in fighting following the disruption
of oil exports from Iraq to Turkey, air strikes against Iraq
resumed Thursday when British jets attacked a surface-to-air
missile site in southern Iraq, U.S. and British officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The disruption of the oil flow, which occurred on Sunday and
Monday after U.S. jets struck radio towers that control the
pipeline, prompted criticism from some allies that the repeated air
strikes in the no-flight zones had gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British jets suspended their patrols long enough to
allow U.N. inspectors to investigate the damage, an administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite initial Iraqi claims that the damage was extensive, oil
began flowing early Thursday and quickly returned to earlier
levels, according to the United Nations, which oversees the program
that allows Iraq to sell up to $5.2 billion of oil every six months
to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline, which runs from Kirkuk to Ceyhan, Turkey, carries
1 million barrels of oil a day, roughly half of what Iraq has been
pumping under the program.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. strikes on Sunday and Monday knocked out two of eight
communication towers linked to it. U.N. inspectors reported
significant damage from explosions and heat, providing far more
detailed assessment of the attacks than the Pentagon has been
giving.
</P>
<P>
   At the first tower, 40 miles from Zakho, a generator room was
completely destroyed, according to the inspectors' report. At the
second tower, at Ain Zalah, two missiles ``completely destroyed'' a
control room.
</P>
<P>
   After the strikes, the Pentagon reviewed the decision to select
the towers as targets and concluded that they were being used by
the Iraqi military to communicate and thus were legitimate targets,
an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   A military official said the Pentagon had not ruled out
attacking other communications posts but would consider their
``dual use'' in planning future strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we fully understood enough about what that radio
relay did in terms of monitoring pipeline flow,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's strikes, British Tornado jets attacked a missile
site about 15 miles south of Basra. No U.S. aircraft were involved.

<P>
   In a nationwide test that measures the reading ability of public
school students, no state lost ground last year, and a handful _
led by Connecticut _ made significant gains, according to
state-by-state results released Thursday by the Department of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   The results, for fourth- and eighth-graders in the National
Assessment of Educational Progress, inspired policy-makers and
politicians _ including Vice President Al Gore as he visited the
Bronx _ to urge a redoubling of efforts to improve reading and
writing skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two challenges that I think are particularly
important in improving education,'' Gore said after reading to
second-graders at Public School 153 in Co-op City in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first is reducing class size and the second is making sure
all children, by the time they are 8 years old, can pick up a book
and say, `I can read that all by myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   The test, one hour long and a combination of multiple-choice and
written responses, was given in February 1998 to 18,680 fourth- and
eighth-graders whose states and territories volunteered to take
part.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth grade, 39 states and four territories took part,
and for the eighth grade, 36 states and four territories.
</P>
<P>
   The tests are graded on a scale of 1 to 500, with the national
average for fourth-grade public school students at 215, a
three-point gain from 1994 but the same as 1992.
</P>
<P>
   For eighth-graders, the average was 261, but no comparison for
previous years is available because this was the first year those
results were computed state by state. The overall results, without
the state-by-state breakdown, were reported last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Education also breaks down the results by four
achievement levels _ below basic, basic, proficient and advanced _
and uses ``at or above proficient'' as the benchmark for the
strongest reading skills.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 29 percent of the fourth-graders were at or above
proficiency _ a slight rise from the 28 percent in 1994 and 27
percent in 1992 _ and 31 percent of eighth-graders rated proficient
or better.
</P>
<P>
   Affluent states outperformed less-prosperous ones and
traditionally strong regions like the Northeast had higher scores
than traditionally weaker ones, like the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Connecticut were jubilant about the results, which
showed improvement among all races in both scores and the
percentage of students judged proficient.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Sergi, the state's education commissioner, said
affluence was a factor in the overall score, but he noted poorer
students showed gains as well. Sergi attributed the success in part
to a statewide push to demand proficient reading at the earliest
grade levels.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-graders in Connecticut scored 10 points higher on the
fourth-grade test, rising to 232 from 222 in 1994 (the score in
1992 was also 222). Eighth-graders scored 272, 11 points higher
than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   In proficiency, Connecticut students also outranked their peers
in other states, with 46 percent of fourth-graders rating at or
above proficiency compared with 29 percent nationally. Forty-two
percent of eighth-graders were at or above proficiency compared
with 31 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   New York performed about average in 1998 and showed no gain from
1992 on the fourth-grade test. Eighth-graders performed slightly
better than the national average. Black and Hispanic students, who
tend to be poorer and in schools lacking the resources of their
suburban counterparts, did more poorly on the test.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey chose not to participate in the test.

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The Dodgers pulled a fast one on the Angels, who
aren't too happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Freeway Series has been reduced from three games to
one this spring because the Dodgers jumped at the opportunity to
play host to the defending World Series champion New York Yankees
on April 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are upset for two reasons:
</P>
<P>
   __ It was their turn to play host to two of the three games.
They will play the Dodgers April 2 at Edison Field but lose the
gate for a second game.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Freeway Series games have been the final games before the
start of the regular season, so facing major-league level
competition is important. With most major-league teams already
having their schedules set, the Angels could not find another
major-league team to play. Instead, the Angels will play the
Aguascalientes Railroadmen of the Mexican League _ equivalent to
Triple-A _ April 3, then play Cal State Fullerton April 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that irritates me is we're a good team with good
players and we can't get a game (against another major-league
team),'' said Angels manager Terry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Collins added that he was appreciative to Aguascalientes and
CSUF for the games because otherwise the Angels would have had no
one to play.
</P>
<P>
   Angels closer Troy Percival has another perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they (Dodgers) realize we might be stealing their
thunder,'' said the Southern California native. ``I think they know
there's another good team in town. They have the tradition and
they've earned it, but we're starting to step on their toes a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are fighting for respect across the country, not just
in Southern California, Percival said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the media and the fans,'' Percival said. ``We're
respected by other teams. We can't control what anyone else thinks.
We play hard and we play the right way. We've won some people over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You listen to the Yankees last year. They were saying they
were glad they weren't playing the Angels (in the playoffs).''
</P>
<P>
   Last season the Angels were the only team to take the season
series from the Yankees, winning six of 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bumps and bruises: Pitcher Chuck Finley, bothered by a
strained muscle in his upper back the past few days, threw off the
mound Thursday. He is expected to start Saturday's Cactus League
game against the Oakland A's in Phoenix if there are no setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Randy Velarde was hit on the left forearm by a
pitch thrown by nonroster pitcher Reid Cornelius in an intrasquad
game Thursday afternoon. Velarde had the forearm wrapped in ice,
but no X-rays were planned. ``The perfect spot for him is on the
forearm,'' Collins said, noting Velarde's well-developed physique.
</P>
<P>
   The intrasquad game was called after six innings _ one pitch
after Velarde was hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got these young pitchers who want to impress you and
sometimes they overthrow,'' Collins said. ``Up steps Mo Vaughn and
they try to do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Reggie Williams (food poisoning) and catcher Phil
Nevin (sore hamstring) had the day off.
</P>
<P>
   __ Today's play: The Angels begin Cactus League play today at
12:05 p.m. at Tempe Diablo Stadium. Steve Sparks (9-4, 4.34 ERA in
'98) will start for the Angels against the A's. The game will be
broadcast on KLAC-570.
</P>
<P>
   Finley is tentatively slated to start Saturday's game and Tim
Belcher will start Sunday.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    During his original race for the presidency, Bill Clinton was
asked by Morality in Media, the oldest anti-porn group, whether he
would enforce federal obscenity laws that had begun to be enforced
in the Reagan and Bush administrations.
 &HT;    Clinton wrote back: ''Be assured that aggressive enforcement of
the federal obscenity laws, particularly by the Child Exploitation
and Obscenity section, will be a priority in a Clinton-Gore
Administration.''
 &HT;    That's one promise he has not kept. Morality in Media (MIM)
President Robert Peters reported recently that U.S. attorneys in
fiscal 1997 began only six prosecutions of obscenity, down from 42
initiated in 1992. That's a drop of 86 percent!
 &HT;    ''Adult Video News,'' the video porn trade publication, endorsed
Clinton for re-election in 1996 due to his ''hands-nearly-off porn
policy.'' Not surprisingly, Larry Flynt, publisher of ''Hustler''
magazine, was the president's most ardent defender during the
impeachment proceedings. He offered $1 million to anyone who could
document having had extramarital sex with prominent Republicans,
and brought down Rep. Robert Livingston, who acknowledged having
adulterous affairs, declined to run as speaker of the House, and
has now resigned.
 &HT;    A U.S. News &AMP; World Report cover story reports that in 1996,
''Americans spent more than $8 billion on hardcore videos, peep
shows, live sex acts, adult cable programming, sexual devices,
computer porn and sex magazines an amount much larger than
Hollywood's domestic box office receipts and larger than all the
revenues generated by rock and country music recordings. Americans
now spend more money in strip clubs than at Broadway, off-Broadway,
regional and nonprofit theaters, at the opera, the ballet and jazz
and classical music performances combined.''
 &HT;    So? What is the problem with sex between consenting adults?
 &HT;    In 1986 the Meese Commission on Pornography concluded that
''clinical and experimental research'' is ''virtually unanimous''
that ''exposure to sexually violent materials'' sparks ''an
increase in the likelihood of aggression.'' In an Introduction I
wrote to the report, I cited evidence. First, a study that rapists
are 15 times as likely as non-offenders to have had exposure to
hard-core pornography ''during childhood or between six to ten
years old.''
 &HT;    Second, ''cross-national data from areas as disparate as
England, Australia, Singapore and South Africa'' found that ''rape
reports have increased where porn laws have been liberalized while
the same steep rise is not in evidence where restrictions exist.''
 &HT;    Third, even nonviolent, soft-core pornography may ''legitimate
rape.'' The eight major men's magazines such as Playboy, Hustler
and Penthouse, had sales that were five times higher per capita in
such states as Alaska and Nevada than in other states. And rape
rates were six times higher per capita in Alaska and Nevada than
North Dakota.
 &HT;    Those findings are 13 years old, and have been disputed by some
researchers. But a report for the National Coalition for the
Protection of Children and Families by Dr. Stan Weed cited a 1994
review by Lyons, Anderson and Larsen of 152 studies which concluded
that by witnessing rape pornography scenes, 88 percent of men felt
rape victims were ''less injured, resisting less, and experiencing
less trauma. Further, when assured of anonymity, about half of the
men surveyed expressed some likelihood of raping.''
 &HT;    What about nonviolent porn? Prolonged exposure to it ''promotes
acceptance of pre- and extramarital sexuality ... decreases trust
among sexual intimates ... spawns doubts about the value of
marriage as an essential societal institution ... breeds discontent
with the physical appearance and the sexual performance of intimate
partners.''
 &HT;    Pornography is thus a major destroyer of marriages.
 &HT;    Further, hard-core pornography is far more available now than
when the Meese Commission filed its report. A huge new source is
the Internet, where there are 70,000 publicly viewable Web sites.
Teenage girls can be seen having sex with animals, for example. A
single site had 407,000 visitors on Dec. 4, according to the
National Journal.
 &HT;    Yet there has never been any federal prosecution of Internet
purveyors of porn or any of Cable TV. A MIM-sponsored poll reveals
that 87 percent of women and 72 percent of men believe ''federal
obscenity laws against hard-core pornography should be vigorously
enforced.''
 &HT;    But we have a president against whom credible charges of rape
were filed by Juanita Brodderick last week.
 &HT;    ''Clinton has not denied them as any decent man would,' says Pat
Trueman, who directed Bush Administration obscenity prosecution. He
sees no hope of change: ``There are few rapists concerned with the
problem of pornography in America. We have not had obscenity
prosecution and we should not expect them from a morally bankrupt
president.''

FIRST LADY SPEAKS ON WOMEN'S ISSUES AT U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the second day of her visit as a potential
candidate for a New York Senate seat, Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke
out Thursday at the United Nations against ``the egregious and
systematic trampling'' of women's rights under the Taliban in
Afghanistan, and called the trafficking in women and children in
Asia an international human rights violation.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who has made women's human rights a focus of her
work as first lady, has spoken out repeatedly on both issues, and
her remarks were consistent with Clinton administration policy. But
they come at a time when she is under increased scrutiny as a
potential Senate candidate, and underscore her strong stand on
women's issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a 30-minute speech to 1,000 U.N. staff and delegates in the
U.N. Trusteeship Council, Mrs. Clinton said that she had spoken
with young girls in Thailand whose parents had sold them as
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could often tell the home of where girls had been sold
because they might even have a satellite dish, or an addition built
onto the house,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``But I met the girls who had
come home after they had been used up, after they had contracted
HIV and AIDS. If you've ever held the hand of a 13-year-old girl
dying of AIDS, you can understand how critical it is that we take
every step possible to prevent this happening to any other girl,
anywhere, in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing remarks often made by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Mrs. Clinton said: ``It is no longer acceptable to say
that the abuse and mistreatment of women is cultural. It should be
called what it is _ criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Mrs. Clinton spoke about women's sports at the
Lab School at the O. Henry Learning Center in Chelsea, where a
student basketball player, Sofia Totti, introduced Mrs. Clinton as
``hopefully, a runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton grinned _ the only sign she gave Thursday to New
York Democrats who are in a frenzy hoping that she will run next
year for the seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   All day, Mrs. Clinton avoided the crowd of reporters trailing
her. Three times at the United Nations, Mrs. Clinton walked by
penned-in reporters shouting questions about the Senate race
without saying a word.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry said that Mrs. Clinton ``doesn't have anything to add
right now'' to her earlier comments about the race.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Mrs. Clinton said she was giving ``careful thought''
to a Senate run and that she would make a decision ``later this
year.'' Her advisers have not given a more specific timetable,
although the view of New York Democrats is that the longer Mrs.
Clinton waits to announce a decision _ perhaps as late as the fall
_ the more likely she is to run. Many Democrats want her to make up
her mind more quickly so that she doesn't hamper other candidates
from raising money.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton appeared at the Lab School to promote an HBO film
on women's sports with Bille Jean King, the former tennis champion;
Nikki McCray, the women's basketball star; and Dominique Dawes, the
gymnast and Olympic gold medalist. Afterward students sent written
questions to the panel, but none were for Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks to teachers and junior high school students, Mrs.
Clinton said she wanted Congress in a bipartisan way to make
teachers and lowering classroom size ``their very top priority.''
She also recalled playing ``half-court'' basketball in high school,
when girls had to stay on one side of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said the girls asked why they could not play like
the boys and were told, ``We're sorry, but we just don't think
girls' hearts can take that much exertion.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton seemed to have a lot of support among the students,
a number of whom volunteered to reporters that they had seen the
``20-20'' interview with Monica Lewinsky the night before.
``Hillary is very strong,'' said Christopher Williams, 13, an
eighth grader. ``If she can live through that and get along, she's
like superwoman. That's a lot of stress.''

GERMAN OFFICIAL SUGGESTS ALLIANCE WITH EX-COMMUNISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Already under fire from business, Germany's finance
minister, Oskar Lafontaine, has divided his own governing Social
Democratic Party and irked Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder with a
suggestion that a political alliance with former East German
communists would be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine, the chairman of the Social Democrats, said on Monday
that a 1994 statement by the party ruling out political cooperation
with the Party of Democratic Socialism, the former communists, was
``superfluous,'' ``old hat'' and ``overtaken by reality.''
</P>
<P>
   His policy switch reflected the fact that the Party of
Democratic Socialism is now an important political force _ it won
5.7 percent of the national vote in federal elections last year and
21 percent of the vote in the former East Germany _ and already
cooperates with the Social Democrats in the government of two
eastern states.
</P>
<P>
   But in Germany's charged political and economic environment,
where business confidence has been eroded by Lafontaine's new tax
proposals and by his constant skirmishing with central bankers over
interest rates, an opening to the former communists amounted to a
high-risk political gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, who is in the uncomfortable position of being
beholden to Lafontaine for party support at the same time that he
is uneasy about his finance minister's more left-leaning
inclinations, shot back on Tuesday, saying he had ``made it clear
that there will be no cooperation with the PDS in the German
Bundestag.''
</P>
<P>
   Any cooperation at the local or state level would ``not be
transferred to the federal level,'' the chancellor added.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange between the two men amounted to one of the more
evident expressions of a simmering tension whose roots seem to lie
in the fact that Lafontaine was the architect of Schroeder's
electoral victory last year and seems disinclined to bow entirely
to the chancellor's authority.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government took office four months ago, the
differences between the two men have tended to paralyze economic
decision-making, leaving the direction of policy unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But Lafontaine appeared more concerned with political than
economic considerations. The government of Social Democrats and
environmentalist Greens lost its majority in the upper house of
Parliament when it was defeated last month in state elections in
Hesse.
</P>
<P>
   To regain that majority, the government needs to win other
regional elections this year.

KENTUCKY HORSE FARM OFFICIALS INDICTED IN ALLEGED BRIBERY SCHEME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ky.) 
 
By ED ASHER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Two executives of a famed Kentucky thoroughbred farm
have been indicted on charges of offering a $1.1 million bribe to a
director of a now-defunct Houston bank to obtain $50 million in
loans.
</P>
<P>
   A federal indictment unsealed Wednesday provides new details of
possible links between Calumet Farm Inc. of Lexington, Ky., and the
failure of First City Bancorporation of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that beginning in February 1988, Calumet
President John T. Lundy and chief financial officer Gary Matthews
conspired to pay a $1.1 million bribe to a First City director to
obtain the loans, presumably to prop up the financially ailing
farm.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Julia Hyman declined to say whether the
money was actually paid to the director, who was not named in the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will come out at trial,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment says the director had a ``valuable lifetime
breeding right'' in Alydar, a famed race horse owned by Calumet,
and had ``other business with Calumet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lundy, Matthews and the director intentionally failed to
disclose the latter's financial interest in Calumet to First City
officers, the indictment alleges.
</P>
<P>
   It says the director used his bank position not only to
facilitate approval of the loans to Calumet but also to ``frustrate
and impede First City officers' attempts to collect from Calumet.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, returned Dec. 11, charges Lundy and Matthews
with one count each of conspiracy to defraud a financial
institution, scheme to defraud and bank bribery and three counts of
false statements to bank officials.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from an ongoing investigation into loan
activities involving First City, which failed in 1992. First City
was later reorganized into First City Financial Corp., a Waco-based
firm that handles mortgages for borrowers with credit problems.
</P>
<P>
   Also on-going is an investigation into Alydar's mysterious 1990
death, which Hyman said involves ``possible insurance fraud.'' The
horse's death from a leg broken in his stall was ruled accidental.
</P>
<P>
   Alydar, history's most heavily insured thoroughbred, was put up
by Calumet as collateral on its loans from First City, Calumet's
biggest creditor.
</P>
<P>
   First City had warned the farm that a $15 million loan payment
was due by February 1991 or foreclosure could begin. After Alydar
died suddenly on Nov. 13, 1990, Calumet collected $36.5 million in
insurance claims, with $20.5 million of that going to First City.
</P>
<P>
   Lundy was arrested by U.S. Customs Service officials Tuesday
night in Miami on his arrival from Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   His bond hearing is scheduled Thursday in Miami, and Hyman said
prosecutors will ask that he be held without bond. ``Based on
flight risk,'' she said, declining to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews, arrested Wednesday in Lexington, was released on a
$10,000 personal recognizance bond and directed to report to court
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Calumet _ which produced Whirlaway, Citation and six other
Kentucky Derby winners _ collapsed soon after Alydar's death.
</P>
<P>
   Its 1991 bankruptcy was the largest farm collapse in
thoroughbred history, listing debts of more than $120 million. It
was sold the next year at auction for $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   The $36.5 million Alydar insurance claim was the largest of its
kind.
</P>
<P>
   At least five people, including former First City vice chairman
Frank Cihak, have been convicted of fraud in connection with other
loans by the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Cihak was sentenced in 1996 to nearly 22 years in prison for his
part in what prosecutors called a multimillion-dollar kickback
scheme. At the time, Cihak was already serving a sentence of more
than 12 years in a federal prison in Michigan for another First
City-related conviction.
</P>

MAYOR IS STEP CLOSER TO CONTROL OF DETROIT SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Frustrated by the many problems of Detroit's public
schools, Michigan's governor and Republican-controlled Legislature
are moving swiftly to put the system under the mayor's control.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate voted 30 to 7 on Tuesday to approve legislation
for the change, and the House is expected to approve a similar bill
as soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, John Engler, predicted in an interview that he
would be able to sign the bill by Easter, giving Detroit's mayor,
Dennis Archer, enough time to name a new board before the school
year begins in September. While Democratic lawmakers are divided on
the issue, Archer has welcomed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Management of the schools has been chaotic at times, and student
performance disappointing. Half the students do not graduate, and
half of those who do have trouble meeting state standards for high
school graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth graders come close to the state averages on standardized
tests, but by seventh grade only a third of the students here can
read, or perform math, at their grade level.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having classrooms without enough books or supplies, the
district has a $93 million surplus, partly because officials have
used low-paid substitutes to fill the 1,100 vacancies among 12,000
teaching positions, Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Only $400 million has been spent of a $1.5 billion bond issue
for long-term capital improvements approved in 1994. A series of
school superintendents have been hired, promising substantial
changes, only to end up arguing with the school board and leaving.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal for mayoral takeover has become very
controversial. Opponents here have contended that it is
undemocratic to replace an elected school board and that it smacks
of racism for a white governor and all-white Republican majorities
in the state House and Senate to be making decisions for a city
where 76 percent of the residents and 91.3 percent of the public
school students are black.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been an issue that has been this controversial
and this disruptive to the social fabric of Detroit since 1967,''
when riots devastated a large section of the city, said State Rep.
Keith Stallworth.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed takeover of Detroit's schools has the support
Archer, who is black, and one of the most powerful political forces
in the city, the largely black Council of Baptist Pastors. Polls
also show considerable public support.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover effort is inspired by Chicago's example. With
authority granted by the Illinois Legislature, Mayor Richard M.
Daley took control of the even more troubled Chicago school system
and replaced its school board in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton cited the recent improvement in Chicago's
schools in his State of the Union address in January, although some
educators have questioned whether the mayor deserves all of the
credit.
</P>
<P>
   The perception of success in Chicago may produce many imitators.
According to the National School Boards Association, proposals for
mayors to take over school systems are now at various stages of
discussion in St. Louis, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, and
Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, who came out last week in favor of the plan, said the
school board had ignored too many proposals over the years to
improve its financial management practices and the overall
administration of schools. The municipal school unions and the
pastors council endorsed the plan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The stance of the Baptist pastors was a particular surprise
because the president of the school board, Darryl L. Redmond, is a
Baptist pastor and a member of the council. He abstained from the
council's vote on the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   A poll last month by Epic/MRA, an independent polling firm in
Lansing, Mich., found that 54 percent of Detroit residents favored
a mayoral takeover of the school system while 32 percent opposed
it.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, a member of the school board since 1995 and its
president since January, said that the public favored reform in the
city's schools but that reform could take place without replacing
the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are not distinguishing, should the schools be
reformed and should the governance structure be changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the problems of Detroit's schools are the city's
problems _ notably poverty and crime, Redmond said. The city has
the lowest median household income of any big city in the nation,
and a murder rate six times that of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   According to Michigan's Department of Education, 70 percent of
Detroit's students receive school lunches for free or for reduced
prices, compared with only 31.6 percent of all students statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond said the difficulty in filling teaching positions was
due to a national shortage of teachers. The school district's
generous, union-negotiated policies on compensatory time and sick
days complicate matters, with as many as a tenth of the teachers
not showing up for work on any given day. Many teachers are owed
200 or more days of compensatory time, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Detroit school district has a troubled history. In a
landmark decision, the Supreme Court ruled in 1974 that students
could not be bused between Detroit and its suburbs to remedy racial
imbalances.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which effectively barred most busing among
different school districts, crippled or halted busing programs in
many Northern cities and contributed to white flight to the suburbs
here. Many of the remaining whites here are elderly and do not have
children.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond and Stallworth said they were particularly bothered that
the state Senate had defeated on Tuesday an amendment that would
have required a citywide vote on allowing the mayor to replace the
elected school board. Instead, the Senate bill calls for the school
board's immediate replacement and schedules a vote after five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's anti-American to have one million people's votes
overturned,'' Redmond said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's supporters point out that Archer is also an elected
official. Moreover, he is the city's most popular politician,
according to Epic/MRA, having received an 88 percent approval
rating in last month's poll.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor faces a recall campaign organized by local
businessmen angry that he has awarded some contracts, including
valuable casino licenses, to out-of-town businesses that are not
controlled by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Stallworth said part of the hostility to a mayoral takeover
reflected a worry that the school board's purchasing policies,
which include a strong reliance on minority contractors, might be
changed.

BRAZIL INCREASES A KEY INTEREST RATE TO 45 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ The Brazilian central bank raised its
benchmark interest rate Thursday to 45 percent and granted its new
president expanded powers to adjust rates in an effort to head off
a surge of inflation and to stabilize the country's battered
currency.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary authority's actions were the first to be taken
under Arminio Fraga, a former aide to the financier George Soros.
Fraga was confirmed on Wednesday as central bank president by the
Brazilian Senate after an acrimonious debate.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Brasilia Thursday afternoon, Fraga
promised a vigorous response to the country's financial crisis,
saying his administration would be ``pro-active, not reactive.''
</P>
<P>
   The interest rate increase, from 39 percent, helped steady the
Brazilian currency, the real, in trading Thursday. The real has
declined in value against the dollar by more than 40 percent since
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting an all-time low of 2.22 to the dollar on Tuesday,
the real recovered strongly, closing at 2.07 to the dollar, up 3.9
percent from Wednesday. The stock market also reacted favorably,
grateful for any indication that the government was taking the
offensive. Sao Paulo's Bovespa exchange rose 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters after announcing the interest rate
increase, Fraga made it clear that his primary goal was to stem the
sharp rise in consumer prices brought on by the devaluation of the
real.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exchange rate is important, but what will determine our
success or not is the rate of inflation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the real under siege, the central bank earlier this week
announced, apparently at Fraga's behest, that banks' compulsory
deposit requirements would be raised to 26.5 percent as of Friday
and 30 percent later this month. The monetary authority said it was
taking that step ``to dry up liquidity'' and ``relieve pressure on
the real.''
</P>
<P>
   In raising interest rates, Fraga was adhering to advice
profferred by the International Monetary Fund. At a news conference
in Washington on Wednesday, the fund's chief economist, Michael
Mussa, said that while he hoped Brazilian ``interest rates will end
up this year substantially lower'' than they did in 1998, ``if the
real continues to depreciate, they will probably need to push up
interest rates further.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all analysts agree with that approach. In an interview
with the Globo News cable channel on Wednesday, Jeffrey Sachs, a
Harvard University professor who has served as an adviser to
several emerging countries, argued that Brazil should immediately
cut the interest rate to 20 percent in an effort to create jobs and
slow the increase of its mounting internal deficit.

   STOCKS GET LIFT FROM IBM BUT STAY IN TRADING RANGE
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of sour news on technology stocks, the sector
received a boost when IBM announced that it had won a $16 billion
order from Dell Computer for parts like disk drives and displays.
Despite the increase, the market is still locked in the trading
range it has been in since January.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 191.52 points, or 2
percent, to 9,467.40. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index climbed
18.94 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,246.64, while the Nasdaq
composite index rose 27.69 points, or 1.22 percent, to 2,292.89. In
the bond market, Treasury securities were little changed.
</P>
<P>
   NONCOMBATANTS STUCK IN TRADE WAR
</P>
<P>
   After months of bitter feuding between the United States and
Europe over bananas, scores of companies are now caught in a bitter
trade battle in which they have no stake and over which they have
no control.
</P>
<P>
   RETAIL SALES CLIMB 7.6 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Retailers' sales at stores open at least a year rose 7.6 percent
in February, more than expected, as shoppers snapped up basic
household goods at discounters like Wal-Mart Stores and new spring
fashions at clothing chains like Gap. Among the apparel chains, Ann
Taylor Stores posted a sales increase of 21.4 percent, lifting its
shares $2.75, to $41.75.
</P>
<P>
   BANK LEGISLATION SEEMS IN TROUBLE
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate committees took action on sharply conflicting
bills to eliminate Depression-era barriers between banks,
securities firms and insurance companies, reducing the chances that
Congress will pass major banking legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT BREAKUP PROPOSED
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest software-industry trade group has warned
the government not to impose sanctions on Microsoft that could
``fracture'' Windows' role as an industry standard if the company
loses its antitrust suit. But a report by the group recommends that
the government consider breaking up Microsoft as a cure for what
the report regards as the lack of competition in the software
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft announced its electronic commerce strategy, which
includes software and services designed to automate business.
</P>
<P>
   INTEL TO BUY CHIP MAKER LEVEL ONE
</P>
<P>
   Intel agreed to buy Level One Communications for $2.2 billion in
stock as it pushes into the fast-growing market for chips used in
networking equipment.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL RAISES INTEREST RATE
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian central bank raised its benchmark interest rate to
45 percent and granted its new president expanded powers to adjust
rates in the future to head off inflation and stabilize the
country's battered currency.
</P>
<P>
   RARE COINS GO TO TURKEY
</P>
<P>
   The investor William I. Koch handed a trove of ancient Greek
coins to the Turkish government. Officials said the coins, which
were issued around 465 B.C. and which Koch bought more than a
decade ago, had been illegally removed from their country.

L.A. MAY LURE GAME MAKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One of the biggest names in videogame production
will move from New York City to Los Angeles to be closer to
competitors such as THQ Inc., an industry journal reported this
week.
</P>
<P>
   MCV, a business weekly that tracks the $6 billion-per-year
videogame market, said the new chief executive at Manhattan-based
GT Interactive Software Corp. told his staff that he plans to move
much of the firm's headquarters from the Big Apple to Southern
California in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The executive, Thomas Heymann, headed the The Disney Store chain
before he left the Walt Disney Co. Heymann took over as chief
executive and chairman of the New York software firm Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
   GT Interactive is one of the nation's top game makers for the
PC, Macintosh, Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64 platforms. For the
nine months that ended Dec. 31, the company generated sales of
$479.3 million on games such as the ``Doom'' series, ``Duke Nukem:
Time to Kill,'' ``Deer Hunter'' and ``Deer Hunter II.'' Less
homicidal titles include ``Blue's Birthday Party.''
</P>
<P>
   By moving the company to Southern California, Heymann would put
it closer to THQ, Interplay and Activision, as well as the gaming
wings of movie studios Sony, Universal Studios, Warner Bros. and
DreamWorks SKG. But precisely where the Manhattan firm might set up
shop is open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   Rohit Shukla, executive director of the Los Angeles Regional
Technology Alliance, said the most likely move would be to the West
Los Angeles area or Burbank because of the large number of
game-making firms already located there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company is just getting started in town, they need to be
around other people, breathe the dust, that sort of thing,'' Shukla
said.
</P>
<P>
   A third option would be Culver City, he said, largely because of
the presence of Sony.
</P>
<P>
   GT Interactive releases software under a number of labels,
including Humongous Entertainment, Cavedog Entertainment and
Oddworld Inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Heymann was unavailable for comment Thursday on the possible
move, and a company spokesman would not comment on the MCV story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short of it is, this isn't the time for us to discuss
plans being considered,'' said spokesman John Uppendahl.
</P>
<P>
   If the company moves, Heymann will almost certainly lose some
staff members reluctant to make the switch. And that may be part of
his plan, since the Los Angeles area probably has more videogame
programmers than any other part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, local players say they haven't had any
employees give notice to join GT in new Los Angeles offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a small industry that it's pretty common'' to see
employees poached from one firm to another, said Amy Greenholtz, a
spokeswoman for THQ. ``But I haven't heard anything.''

SPORTS COLUMN: AVOIDING DUKE AND WATCHING THE WIZARDS OF RANKING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is something I learned from reading the wires between games
of the Big East basketball tournament: All Division I teams are
rated by the Collegiate Basketball News, all the way from No. 1
down to No. 310.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest team on this unofficial rating percentage index is
Jerry Falwell's school, Liberty University of Virginia, which has
lost all 20 of its games.
</P>
<P>
   The way I hear it, Liberty could have scheduled an easy victory
against the Teletubbies, who, after all, suit up only four weird
little runts, but Liberty refused to play the Teletubbies in that
spooky dome of theirs, where guys might whack you with their
pocketbooks.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of this gigantic spectrum are the Duke Blue
Devils, who inexplicably lost a game this season and are
everybody's worst-case scenario in the national tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The College of Charleston (No. 37) doesn't want Duke, Samford
(No. 74) doesn't want Duke, Winthrop (No. 150) doesn't want Duke.
Nobody wants Duke, not early, not midway through, not until the
night of March 29 in St. Petersburg, Fla., at the very earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to avoid the best team in the country as long as
possible. This takes on special meaning for a school like
Connecticut, which would like to get to a Final Four before this
millenium runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Connecticut's potential chagrin Thursday when it was
slogging along behind Seton Hall midway through the second half. A
loss to those people could have jeopardized an entire season of
work up in the outback of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   There was an operative theory that a loss to Seton Hall could
have dropped Connecticut into the same East Regional with none
other than the Duke Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just what I was thinking about at the 10-minute mark,''
said Jim Calhoun, the coach of Connecticut, who has a pretty decent
sense of irony for a man in his gloomy profession. `` `Seattle or
Lexington? Did you book rooms at the Omni or the Marriott?' That's
exactly what I was thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut survived the ordeal, 57-56, and lived to play
against Syracuse in Friday night's Big East semifinal. Calhoun then
gave his own personal spin on why Connecticut should be seeded
first in some regional, any regional.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said that this Big East tournament is important, but
that it really should have no bearing in where his team will be
seeded by a hidden committee in Kansas City on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   These Wizards of Odds employ their own official rating
percentage index that they decline to make public, which is why the
Collegiate Basketball News performs the vital public service of
using the same criteria for its own ratings. It currently projects
Duke to the East, Michigan State to the Midwest, Connecticut to the
West and Auburn to the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's done,'' Calhoun said, noting that Connecticut has
won 26 of 28, and has played two top teams, Stanford and Michigan
State _ ``plus winning the Big East against St. John's and Miami,
who could be Final Four teams, certainly.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun suggested that the wizards' minds already are made up,
and there is no point in confusing them with trivia like a
potential upset in the Big East tournament, which essentially
serves no purpose other than keeping people out of snow flurries in
early March.
</P>
<P>
   But while Connecticut was losing to Seton Hall, had Calhoun seen
his life _ at least his No. 1 seeding _ flashing before his eyes?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a 25-3 record, as lousy as it may be, would probably
qualify,'' Calhoun said, graciously noting that this was merely his
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Then he speculated what could happen if Maryland ran the
Atlantic Coast Conference, forcing the wizards to reconsider Duke's
body of work for the entire season. Calhoun wanted logic to work
both ways, but as a man who has built a neat little dynasty in the
Big East, he's entitled.
</P>
<P>
   His players said they wanted a No. 1 seeding in a regional
``because that makes the whole field easier, you get to play a lot
of so-called weaker teams,'' as Khalid El-Amin said.
</P>
<P>
   What about avoiding Duke? ``Whatever the selection committee
does, we have to deal with it,'' said Ricky Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with Duke in the Final Four would be fine with
Connecticut. The Teletubbies didn't make it to the tournament, once
again.

IOWA STILL THE PLACE TO GO FOR PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Every four years, it seems, there is more
talk about Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses being a political
anachronism and a distortion of the presidential nominating
process.
</P>
<P>
   In today's America, the argument goes, the state is too bucolic
and too homogeneously white to be considered ``typical,'' and
therefore no longer qualifies as an ideal testing ground for
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   There is talk like that again now, 11 months from the 2000
caucuses scheduled for Feb. 7. But at the present rate that
declared and undeclared candidates are visiting Iowa, it appears
this year's complaints, like those of earlier years, are nothing
more than talk.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent headlong rush of many states to hold early
caucuses and primaries, to a man _ and woman _ the current White
House seekers are serving notice that as far as they are concerned,
Iowa's caucuses still stand, as they have for the past three
decades, as the first serious nominating hurdle to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
   A week later comes the equally traditional, equally challenging
and equally derided first-in-the-nation primary in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the current field of aspirants, including Vice President
Al Gore and the two leading Republicans, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas and Elizabeth Dole, the former head of the American Red
Cross, now have volunteers working Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   A few, like former Vice President Dan Quayle, have even advanced
to having paid staffs in place.
</P>
<P>
   But several, most notably Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., seem to be
slow off the mark in getting organized in the state, a shortcoming
that could be politically fatal if no action is taken by late
spring. Still, McCain himself drops in periodically.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, every announced and potential candidate, except
Bush, has now showed up in the state at least once, and most many
times over.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's only challenger
thus far, flew in Monday for his fourth visit in five weeks,
working the streets and shops of Marshalltown, just northeast of
here, with folksy charm.
</P>
<P>
   He turns out to be a campaigner who, like Gore, is neither
telegenic nor able to pump up large crowds _ except, of course, in
the basketball arena _ but who nevertheless is a master of the
one-on-one ``retail'' politicking that counts most in down-home
states like Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee
showed up in Des Moines for a banquet on Tuesday. It was more than
his 60th visit since his solid third-place finish in 1996, and the
talk is that he probably has the best campaign organization here at
this point.
</P>
<P>
   But, Republican leaders wonder if is it an organization that can
make him competitive with Bush and Mrs. Dole, given the large leads
they now have in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday another Republican, Pat Buchanan, the author and
pundit, came in for a news conference. It was Buchanan's very first
stop after announcing his third presidential candidacy the day
before in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The message he carried was somewhat different from his pitch in
the 1996 Iowa caucuses, when he successfully captured enough of the
state's large Christian conservative vote to finish a surprisingly
strong second. This time around he is talking mainly about
agricultural policy, not abortion and moral decline.
</P>
<P>
   Come Friday, still another Republican, Rep. John R. Kasich of
Ohio, returns, ready to offer up his latest thoughts on taxes and
budgets during a four-day ``Rolling Through Iowa'' tour. Every stop
will be at a bowling alley, which is about as retail as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the other candidates who are in or still thinking
about getting in?
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole has made only one visit. But when she did, she packed
a 2,500-seat hall in Ames, a university town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a `potential' candidate draw like that,'' said
David Yepsen, the dean of Iowa political analysts, who has been
covering presidential caucuses for the Des Moines Register for more
than 25 years. ``The place was humming with enthusiasm for a new
face, not for Bob Dole's wife. A lot of it came from new people,
especially young people and women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This merits close watching,'' Mr. Yepsen said, noting that a
candidate in a crowded field in Iowa can win a plurality with about
25,000.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush, it now seems to be only a matter of time before he
shows up, though for a while there was considerable talk that he
never would, because he figured he could afford to skip Iowa. But
after Mrs. Dole entered the picture and a delegation of Iowans flew
to Austin, Tex., to speak with the governor, that talk died.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate who first sought the
Republican nomination four years ago, has been spending almost as
much time in Iowa as Alexander. In 1996 he made no real effort to
build a campaign organization here and relied mainly on a
television blitz that promoted his call for a flat tax and ripped
at other candidates.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But this time around, he is building a campaign organization and
concentrating heavily on the Christian conservative vote, which is
at least a third of the Republican vote.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christian conservatives worry, however, about just how
strongly Forbes opposes abortion, their most heartfelt cause.
Equally troublesome for him is that every other Republican aspirant
is likely to pick up some of the Christian conservative vote, with
several candidates chasing as hard after it as Forbes is,
especially Gary Baue, former head of the Family Research Council;
Alan Keyes, the talk show host, and Sen. Bob Smith of New
Hampshire. Smith, with little fanfare, has spent the better part of
60 days over the past several years quietly working the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big as the Christian conservative vote is in Iowa, it's hard
to know what to expect from it in the caucuses if it gets shattered
into half a dozen or more small pieces,'' said Dee Stewart, the
executive director of the state's Republican Party. ``That might
leave room for some other candidate who is buried in the pack and
not dependent on that particular vote to suddenly do better than
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what the Iowa caucuses are all about:
expectations met, expectations not met and expectations exceeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we do here in Iowa, our political assignment,'' said
Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat who has vowed to defend Iowa's
first-caucus status against all challengers. ``We take the first
shot at winnowing the field. We build them up and tear them down.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Diminishing the chances that Congress will pass
major banking legislation this year, House and Senate committees
took action Thursday on sharply conflicting bills to eliminate
Depression-era barriers between banks, securities firms and
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in the House completed most of the drafting of a bill
that has broad Democratic and Republican support and suggested that
the House of Representatives might be able to muster enough votes
from both parties to roll back the restrictions of the
Glass-Steagall and Bank Holding Company Acts. Those laws were
products of the nation's experiences of the 1930s, when many large
and small banks and securities firms collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate banking committee tempered expectations that the
106th Congress will be any different than other legislative bodies
in the last 20 years that were unable to repeal the legislation
because of rivalries among regulators and heavy lobbying by
competing industries. In an unusual twist for banking legislation,
it appeared this time around to be falling victim in the Senate to
bare-knuckled partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   More ideologically divided than at any time in recent history on
banking issues, the Senate banking committee passed a measure on an
11-9 party line vote.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said on Wednesday that he would veto the
measure, and unless major compromises are reached _ a dim prospect
judging by Thursday's action _ there will be no new banking
legislation approved by Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the effort against the administration is Sen. Phil
Gramm, the Texas Republican who heads the banking committee and
last year single-handedly derailed a hard-earned compromise bill
forged by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who was then heading the
banking committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, whose administration had expressed support for many of
the provisions in the House bill, earlier this week told Gramm that
he would veto the Senate measure because it would not do enough to
encourage lending to poor neighborhoods, protect bank customers who
also use those institutions to buy stocks and provide enough of a
role for the administration to regulate banks through the Treasury
Department.
</P>
<P>
   By structuring new super-banks that offer insurance and
securities underwriting under a holding company, the Senate
legislation also tilts toward giving more regulatory authority to
the Federal Reserve, as Alan Greenspan, its chairman, has sought.
The House measure, by contrast, puts merchant banking and
securities underwriting in operating subsidiaries, and as such,
would continue to provide a major regulatory role for the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The administration appears to be embarking on a strategy of
focusing on moving a bill through the House to try to build
pressure on Gramm to make compromises. In so doing, administration
officials still face a number of obstacles. Even if the legislation
is completed next week by the House banking committee, as expected,
it could be significantly rewritten in the House commerce
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gramm on Thursday showed no sign that he was
interested in negotiating with the Democrats. Instead, he made his
legislation even less palatable to Democrats and the White House
when he got the committee on a largely partisan vote to amend it to
exempt small banks from the community lending laws. Those laws
require banks and savings associations to lend to the poor and
minorities in their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of prayerful work has gone into this bill but not all
our prayers have been answered,'' Gramm said. ``One of those
prayers that has not been answered is a bipartisan effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats bristled at the confrontational approach Gramm
has undertaken as he begins his tenure as chairman of the banking
committee, a position that D'Amato was forced to relinquish by his
defeat last year by Charles Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has made it very clear he will veto this bill,''
said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. ``I'm not into Pyrrhic exercises. I'm
failing to understand why it is that we're here with a bill as
critical as this and yet we're at an impasse before we start.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm responded that he was more than willing to listen to any
ideas proposed by the members.
</P>
<P>
   ``But are you willing to change your bill?'' asked Kerry. The
question, which remains central to the issue of whether there will
be banking legislation, went unanswered Thursday.

 HUNTER'S WEAKENED ARM CAN'T HELP HIM NOW

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ He's doing all right, Catfish Hunter said. ``Just
my hands and arms don't work. That's the only thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's right arm took him to the Hall of Fame. Hunter's right
arm pitched a perfect game, five successive 20-victory seasons and
224 career victories. Hunter's right arm helped earn him five World
Series championship rings. Now Hunter's right arm doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, five weeks from his 53rd birthday, has Lou Gehrig's
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. He was diagnosed with the
incurable neuromuscular illness last November, and today he made
his first public appearance outside his hometown since then.
</P>
<P>
   Along with other former members of the Yankees, Hunter was
introduced before the team's first exhibition game, its first game
since it won the World Series last October. During the game, Hunter
met with reporters for about 10 minutes and bravely talked about
his condition, peppering his comments with the humor that was a
staple of his performance in his five years with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   _ On his arrival in Tampa Wednesday: ``Ron Guidry and Stump
Merrill picked us up at the airport. Thanks to them we got here
safely. I was scared of my wife's driving.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On his work on his farm: ``The tractor's got power steering;
it's air-conditioned. I can get up on that. I'm like Guidry. I'm a
farmer now that doesn't do too much hard labor.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On a pre-game conversation with Mickey Rivers, a former
teammate: ``I listened to Mickey Rivers for 15 minutes and still
don't know what he said. It was the same way when we were
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the informal gathering at the back of the press
box at Legends Field, Hunter was teary-eyed, and at his mention of
his children and his grandson, he paused to hold back tears. He
also spoke with desperate hope for his future, twice talking about
the possibility of researchers finding a cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you want to cry,'' he said. ``Other times you're
still crying but you're thankful you're living. But the main thing
is maybe there will be a cure for it one of these years and maybe I
can last that long.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance he appeared to be the same Catfish _ Jimmy to
his neighbors and friends in Hertford, N.C. _ that he had been
during his playing days and during subsequent springs in which he
helped coach Yankee pitchers. But except for a couple of weak
handshakes, his arms remained at his sides and his speech reflected
the moisture in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said, acknowledging he finds it hard to talk about
himself. ``I guess now I get teary-eyed a little bit quicker than I
used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was 28 years old when he became an unprecedented free
agent, with the Yankees signing him on New Year's Eve in 1974 to a
five-year contract worth $31 million. He was a farmer then,
spending his winters on his tractor working his fields, and 24
years later he remains a farmer, though a high school friend and
the friend's two sons do most of the work on the 600 acres of
cotton, peanuts, corn and beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cotton and peanuts is where the money is,'' he said. ``Corn
and beans, there isn't any money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter left the farm for Thursday's festivities at George
Steinbrenner's invitation. When he was introduced, he walked easily
from the dugout to home plate. His legs, he said, have not been
affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if I was going to come or not,'' he said. ``The
doctor at Johns Hopkins said he thought it would be real good if I
did come up here, see the trainer, let him work on my arms a little
bit and hands. It might help. I've had therapy, but not working on
my hands and arms like they should be. There's not too much muscles
left, but I never had too much to start with.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he takes two different medications intended to slow
down the disease that collapses muscles and eventually shuts down
organs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor said they're coming up with different things, like
going in through your spine, giving you some kind of medicine
through that,'' Hunter said. ``But they're not sure what works yet
so the doctor said the best thing to do is wait. If we see it does
help, you'll get it. But the main thing is keep your spirit up.''
</P>
<P>
   Has he been able to do that? ``Oh yeah,'' he said, ``I've got my
kids'' _ he paused _ ``and'' _ he paused again _ ``it helps. Plus,
I got one grandson.'' He paused yet again, then added, ``It looks
like he might play ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor James Hunter, the son of Todd Hunter, is only 3 years
old, and Catfish Hunter seemed to be hoping that he would be around
to see him play ball. ``He's got a ball in his hand right now,''
Hunter said. ``He throws with either and he hits either way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said people have spontaneously sent him advice and
medical information from all over the United States, Canada,
Africa, Germany and elsewhere. But the information he gets during
his visits to Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore every 30 to
45 days is the only knowledge he can rely on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They check me out, my arm strength, my leg strength and
everything,'' he said. ``So far they said that my arm strength had
deteriorated some along with my hands, but my legs and breathing
have probably got better since they've been checking it. So I've
been trying to walk every day and try to do exercises to keep my
legs strong anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he had heard from just about everyone he ever played
with and had received a letter from Hank Aaron. He said he also
spent a lot of time with friends at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had a big barbecue at home that I helped throw for a
friend of mine that passed away,'' he related. ``Being around
friends keeps you moving and keeps you happy. It's like what Dick
Williams said about a pitcher. When he starts thinking, he's always
in trouble. So the best thing is not to think.''

PENTAGON FOILS COMPUTER HACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Military security analysts uncovered and stopped
computer hackers who had discovered a new way to attack open
Pentagon networks on the Internet, Pentagon officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before Congress last week, John Hamre, the deputy
secretary of defense, said in a closed-door hearing that this new
method had been uncovered by analysts at the Naval Surface Warfare
Center in Dahlgren, Va., Defense Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The specialists at Dahlgren found a method to thwart those
low-level probes, which differ from the more frequent brutal
assaults on security systems, and alerted all the military services
to the new problem and a remedy for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are literally hundreds of attempts weekly to break into
the computers,'' a Pentagon spokesman said. ``It's constant because
there's a certain cachet to getting into the Pentagon system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has estimated that 99.95 percent of computer
hackers fail to penetrate beyond the open networks, which contain
unclassified material, and so pose no national security concern.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable example of hackers using this new method
occurred in January when a military computer server near San
Antonio was probed for two days from foreign Web sites. These
probes reached only the open military networks connected to the
Internet and it was unclear whether the probes originated overseas
or were merely routed through those sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``These hackers try to cover their tracks by initiating the
intrusions through an overseas site that has nothing to do with
where the hackers actually are,'' the Pentagon spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, each armed service has installed new programs
to detect hackers and to protect sensitive material. As the number
of surveillance programs have increased, so has the number of
detections.
</P>
<P>
   These new military computer security officials have said they
are fighting a ``cyberwar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To them it's a war, but it's like the war on crime or the war
on drugs _ it's the information security guys' war,'' said William
Arkin, author of ``The U.S. Military On Line.''

</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you may be tempted to think that life seems to be one
big muddle and doesn't make any sense at all. Well, there may be a
good reason for thinking that way.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at an analogy. We could be very much like one who
goes to the theater after the curtain has gone up and the play has
been in progress for some time. The latecomer has no knowledge of
the beginning of the story, nor any idea of what the ending may be.
The script may not make sense, and the person may feel confused
regarding the plot of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the drama of life, we may not always know or
understand the plot. Sometimes the script seems pointless. We may
fail to grasp the grand scope of the universal dramas in which we
may be participating.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, there could be an attempt to blame the
``director,'' the ``producer,'' perhaps even the playwright, for
the situation. However, in the universal drama of life, there are
no ``bit players.'' And there is no one to blame! Life can seem
less of a muddle if we read the script correctly and become aware
that we have unique qualities and can bring gifts to the ``show''
that no one else can give.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you've heard the expression, ``the buck stops here.''
This saying is cousin to another one that is quite commonly used in
the United States, ``passing the buck.'' When a person is accused
of passing the buck, he may be said to be avoiding responsibility
and passing it on to someone else. When someone says, ``The buck
stops here,'' he infers that he will handle the matter himself and
take full responsibility for the outcome. Which one of these
expressions do you find yourself in the habit of using?
</P>
<P>
   You may know of someone at this moment in your life who may be
rebelling against unfairness of one sort or another. Perhaps you,
yourself, may be choosing to be antagonistic? Many people
throughout history have chosen to rebel against their government or
their society in order to bring about a higher purpose. Some may
have understood that the cost of their rebellion could be their
very lives; yet, they consented to pay that price. These people
have often assisted in making great changes for the benefit of the
people.
</P>
<P>
   If a student chooses to rebel against his parents, for example,
and as a result finds himself without a place to live or without
any money for college, he must be willing to accept this as the
cost of his rebellion. Likewise, it makes no sense to complain if
our employer cuts our pay when we have failed to do the work we
agreed to do. In that situation, we have received what we have
deserved, and we should learn to accept it without protest.
</P>
<P>
   One time at a county fair, a farmer exhibited a pumpkin grown in
the exact shape of a two-gallon jug. ``When it was no bigger than
my thumb,'' he said, ``I stuck it in the jug and just let it grow.
When it filled the jog, it quit growing.''
</P>
<P>
   What the glass jug did for the pumpkin, our thoughts do for our
life. We may grow as big, as mature, and become as creative as the
things we think about and believe in. But we stop growing at the
limit of our thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things we need to do is to banish the thoughts
that say the control of our life is held by another. We have a
built-in control tower called the faculty of free will, and nothing
can move into our mind unless we are willing to place the ``stamp
of approval'' on the delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The law of responsibility applies in every area of our lives.
For example, if we choose to abuse our bodies with drugs or
alcohol, it becomes imperative that we know the cost of this
decision. We must ask ourselves if the drugs and alcohol are worth
the cost in sickness and wasted time.
</P>
<P>
   One may ask the question, ``How can I take control over my life
when I am faced with such inner turmoil and confusion and my
problems are so large?'' One thing we can do at once is take the
same thought energy we have expressed in ``how can I take
control?'' and turn it around into the thought, ``I am one with the
wisdom of God; I know what to do, and I do it!''
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to exhibit the self-control that leads to
success is to know that faith, not fear; love, not hate; joy, not
sorrow; peace, not tension; freedom, not bondage is the role we
choose to play.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever we choose in terms of our behavior in this life, we
will be much better off if we can truly say, ``The buck stops here.
I am willing to pay the price for my decision. I am willing to
accept the consequences of my actions.''

   MILAN, Italy _ Designers, like many other people, often do their
best work under stress. When the fashion world turned away from the
precise tailoring Italy was known for, the country's designers
floundered for a moment, toying with American-style sportswear and
utility gear.
</P>
<P>
   But they now seem to be blossoming with ideas for more feminine,
more alluring ways of dressing. When you compete in a global
marketplace, you can't afford to stand still.
</P>
<P>
   Look at two of Italy's top stars _ Tom Ford of Gucci and Giorgio
Armani. They're both already on fashion's Mount Olympus, but you
won't catch them napping. They both forged ahead this week with
inspiring fall collections.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone should be under stress these days, it's Ford, whose
company is battling Bernard Arnault's powerful LVMH Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton, which is trying to take control of the Italian
house. The outcome may affect Ford's future at Gucci, but he didn't
let that cramp his design style.
</P>
<P>
   The collection he showed Tuesday night _ with his friends
Donatella and Santo Versace offering emotional support from the
front row _ was his most wide ranging to date. In the past, he's
settled on a theme, like the 1970s or glam rock, but this time he
let loose a cornucopia of ideas. Ford promised before the show that
it would go over the top, and it sometimes did.
</P>
<P>
   There were fabulous glossy leathers in flesh-toned beige, black
and bottle green, sometimes with vertical seams suggesting a stripe
and sometimes draped like fabric and adorned with a leather rose.
He updated the peasant blouse in black leather and softened the
sleeves on other pieces by adding fullness below the elbows.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his sexy bell-bottom pants, with their tight fit through
the thighs, were made even clingier with ruching borrowed from
Austrian window curtains. There were also ruched velvet tops and
knee-length skirts, club-ready beaded lace pants with thin ties
around the knees, and sheer wool tops gathered in front to
accentuate the breasts.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was varied enough to appeal both to women who
want to look sleek and to those who want to ooze sensuality, and
yet it was always unmistakably Gucci as reinvented by Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Armani's take on fashion is more sedate, but equally
imaginative. His front row on Wednesday evening included young
celebrities like Ashley Judd and Joaquin Phoenix as well as the
ageless Sophia Loren (whose entrance into the trendy Bice
restaurant the night before was greeted with applause).
</P>
<P>
   The man who defined an era with his universally imitated
broad-shouldered pants suits has moved with the times into soft,
hip-riding pants with elastic waists and languorous long skirts in
materials that float. These are topped with thin sweaters or clingy
T-shirts, or jackets stripped of lapels, padding and often buttons.
</P>
<P>
   In a collection that extends the meaning of the color gray even
for the gray-obsessed Armani, there are touches of cerulean blue
and apple green. Some jackets have diagonal slits that bare a
sliver of skin, and others have necklines or hemlines turned back
to reveal the colored lining.
</P>
<P>
   Armani's newest pants have a suggestion of draping around the
knees achieved by a few judicious stitches. Others have a row of
loose elastic around the hem that blouses them slightly. Although
this is a winter collection that includes speckled shearlings and
crocodile-patterned suedes, many fabrics are gossamer.
</P>
<P>
   Evening clothes in particular would be totally sheer if they
weren't covered with intricate beadwork patterns. And nothing
demonstrates better how Armani has dealt with the challenge of
changing tastes than those glorious evening dresses, which have
upped the glamour quotient at many an awards show.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty, rather than glamorous, is the word for Alberta
Ferretti's evening dresses, in colors like rose, wine, yellow,
cream or brown velvet forming geometric or mazelike patterns on
tulle. With high waistlines and uneven hems, the clothes have a
youthful femininity that was more ingenue than movie star.
</P>
<P>
   For daytime, Ms. Ferretti showed dresses and coats with high
waists tied with rickrack, and shearlings trimmed with multicolored
embroidery. She is one of the Italian designers who snuggle
comfortably and tastefully into fashion's current decorative mood.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Berardi, a London-based designer who showed in Milan for
the first time this week, is on the opposite end of the sensibility
spectrum. He titled his collection ``Never Mind the Borgias,'' a
tipoff of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   In a churchlike space divided by heavy pillars, he set up a
cruciform runway covered with melted candle wax and centered by a
gigantic censer on a rope swung by an alb-clad ``acolyte.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Models, in elaborate wigs that burlesqued the coils and braids
of Renaissance hairdos, wore punk styles with multiple zippers or
silver studs, kilts with layers of pleats that dipped down to an
uneven hem, a long red turtleneck dress slit up to Naomi Campbell's
waist on one side, and skirts of delicate bobbin lace, as well as a
spectacular hand-painted white shearling coat over a dress in a
matching floral pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Berardi dared to offend by showing exaggerated versions of nuns'
head coverings and a priest's cassock outlined with flashing lights
in the shape of a cross. It was the kind of show that would look
more at home on a London catwalk than in Milan, but it added a jolt
of electricity _ and eccentricity _ to the week.
</P>
<P>
   Veronique Branquinho, who shows her signature collection in
Paris, designed the Ruffo Research line of leathers and shearlings
shown here Monday night in an old tram station. Raf Simons designed
the men's portion of the show. His contributions, except for the
tight pants and down-filled leather jackets, tended to be rather
classic, while hers were more imaginative.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Branquinho showed skirts made of alternating strips of shiny
leather and suede, pullovers and skirts of ultra-thin shearling
striped with bits of the fur side, her favorite Victorian-style
shirt interpreted in black leather, and a floor-length shearling
coat as narrow as a rail.
</P>
<P>
   John Bartlett's collection for Byblos was aimed at a racy young
woman who would wear a cropped leather jacket with jeans,
high-heeled sandals and a biker's shiny silver key chain draped
over her hip.
</P>
<P>
   There were also leather jackets with knitted sections, two-toned
T-shirts with curved shirttail hems, a charcoal cardigan with a
giant pink argyle on one side (to go with the argyle knee socks
teamed with high heels), and black dresses and skirts with a
sparkling band here or there.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes were perfectly fine though lacking in the strong
signature of Bartlett's designs under his own label. But they were
certainly better than what Josephus Thimister served up in his
first collection for Genny (which, like Byblos, is owned by the
Girombelli group).
</P>
<P>
   The Genny styles were simply rehashes of clothes seen on other
runways in other years, and a great disappointment to those who
have admired Thimister's couture collections in Paris and expected
him to reinvigorate Genny. Maybe next time he'll get up his courage
and let loose.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing uptight about Alessandro Dell'Acqua's collection
except the fit of some of the clothes, like the skinny leather
pants or the leather bustier worn with a ruffled chiffon bib and a
cream-colored chiffon skirt. He designs for a hip young woman with
an adventurous fashion streak, quite the opposite of Ferragamo's
customer, who finds contentment in luxury fabrics and beautiful
workmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Ferragamo's cashmeres, alpacas, satins and velvets are certainly
luxurious, and no one could fault the make of the double-faced
wools and reversible leathers. But umpteen versions of the kimono
jacket do not a collection make.
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to say, ``Shoemaker, stick to your last'' to
Ferragamo, as well as to Bottega Veneta. The clothing of both
houses needs more pizazz, though Bottega Veneta did have one
inspired notion: double sweaters that reverse from featherweight
cashmere to airy mohair.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Max Mara and Sportmax lines cater to a customer who
wants fashion that is current but not too advanced, things that
this season mean tasteful embroidery and beadwork on casual styles
like sweaters and suede jackets, and knitted coats layered over
furs. The Max Mara company is one that has successfully weathered
the change from strict tailoring to feminine styles with a hint of
romance.

INITIAL LEWINSKY BOOK SALES SLOW IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
 BOOK-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throngs may have tuned in to watch Monica Lewinsky discuss her
affair with President Clinton on Wednesday, but the show wasn't
enough to send Valley viewers rushing to local bookstores to pick
up her memoir.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Monica's Story,'' the book mostly sat on the shelves of
Valley bookstores after being released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw everything I needed to know last night on 20/20,'' said
Marina Martin, who was cruising the aisles at Barnes &AMP; Noble
Booksellers in southeast Phoenix. ``She didn't say anything that
made me want to buy her book.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC estimated that 74 million people watched the 20/20 segment
with Barbara Walters. The show was second only to the number of
people who watched the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen Media Research gave ABC's Wednesday night interview a
33.4 rating and 48 share, which means that just under half of the
nation's working television sets were tuned in.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky provided the most-watched interview since Oprah
Winfrey's prime-time questioning of Michael Jackson in 1993, which
had a 39.3 rating and 56 share.
</P>
<P>
   But Monica's performance at Valley bookstores was lackluster.
</P>
<P>
   By mid afternoon, B. Dalton in Westridge had only sold about
four, Bookstar in Central Phoenix touted seven and Barnes &AMP; Noble
in Ahwatukee had only one.
</P>
<P>
   Other stores, such as Waldenbooks, Borders and Brentano's
Bookstore, wouldn't release actual booksales, citing company policy
against revealing such information. But employees reported they
hadn't seen many people purchasing the book.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet and in Washington, D.C., however, Lewinsky's
book was being snapped up. The confessional was No. 1 on the
bookseller lists of Amazon.com and barnesandnoble.com., although
neither would say what that status meant in terms of sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those pop culture phenomenons,'' said Ben Boyd,
a spokesman for barnesandnoble.com. He said the book was selling
2.8 copies per minute for a few hours late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, booksellers copiously took names and phone of
eager book buyers, promising to call as soon as a truck delivered
the books on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, many booksellers weren't deterred by the low demand
for Monica's book, which was a collaboration with Princess Diana
biographer Andrew Morton.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Moreno, a supervisor at B. Dalton booksellers in the West
Valley hopes sales will pick up over the weekend. His store is
offering the $24.94 book at a 30 percent discount this week, a
routine discount for new books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early and people are working. But maybe after work today,
we'll get more sales,'' said Moreno, adding that they hold sold
about four copies of the biography.
</P>
<P>
   Added Mark Sutz, of Changing Hands bookstore in Tempe: ``We
think people are interested in reading about what she has to say.
That's why they watched her on T.V. You know she can say more in
the book than she could on T.V. There are unique legal barriers
that don't allow her to say certain things on television. But she
can talk about it in print.''

EDITORIAL: JUSTICE BLACKMUN'S JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, March 5:
</P>
<P>
   He sometimes referred to himself as ``Old No. 3,'' recalling his
unexpected ascension to the Supreme Court in 1970 as President
Nixon's safe third choice following the Senate's rejection of
Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell. But Harry Blackmun, the
retired justice who died Thursday at the age of 90, evolved during
a remarkable 24-year career on the court from a bland and
conservative ``Minnesota twin'' of his boyhood friend Chief Justice
Warren Burger to an empathetic champion of civil rights and civil
liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun secured his legacy just three years into his tenure by
writing the court's wise decision in Roe v. Wade that established
women's constitutional right to abortion. As the court's membership
changed, and amid a steady stream of hate mail, he fought hard to
preserve Roe's central holding and to fend off new abortion
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his lengthy tenure, Blackmun never outgrew his passion
for justice or capacity for change. No one would have predicted
that the justice who cast a dissenting vote in 1971 to block the
publication of the Pentagon Papers by The New York Times would go
on to become a supporter of free speech and affirmative action, or
that he would change his mind on capital punishment, coming to
oppose it in all instances. But the nation is much better for his
journey.

FORMER SCOREBOARD OPERATOR LANGHAM SHARES LEAD AT DORAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Franklin Langham used to work at the Masters when he was
a teen-ager living in Thompson, Ga., 30 miles from Augusta. As a
scoreboard operator at the 16th green, Langham watched Seve
Ballesteros, Jack Nicklaus and other great players, while dreaming
of one day becoming a professional golfer.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, it was Langham's turn to put his name on the leader
board. Shooting a five-under-par 67, including birdies on his final
two holes, Langham was in a four-way tie for first place after the
opening round of the Doral-Ryder Open. Langham shared the lead with
Tommy Armour 3rd, Bob Burns and Scott Dunlap. Of those four
players, only Armour has won a PGA Tour event, and his lone victory
came in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the field's more prominent names struggled at
Doral Golf Resort and Spa, Langham enjoyed his best round of the
year, taking advantage of calm afternoon conditions, after the
morning winds died down. Langham's best career finish on tour was a
tie for second place at last year's Deposit Guarantee Golf Classic.
But Langham tied for seventh last week in Tucson, and he carried
confidence and momentum into Thursday's round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been hitting the ball well for a while,'' said Langham,
30, a University of Georgia graduate who finished 117th on last
year's money list. ``I just started making the putts you need to
play well, the 12- and 15-footers for birdies. I feel my game
starting to come around.''
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that marquee names were missing among the
leaders, because some of them were also missing from the
tournament. Tiger Woods and David Duval, both of whom played Doral
last year, decided to skip this week's tournament, fatigued from
playing a heavy West Coast schedule. Last week's Andersen
Consulting Match Play Championship added a big money event to the
schedule, and many players who were in California last week decided
to pass on Doral.
</P>
<P>
   However, Langham is more worried about the strength of his game
than the strength of the field. And he realized he would still have
to play the best tournament of his career to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a player's standpoint, there are a lot of guys that can
play out here,'' Langham said. ``I guarantee if you look at the
winning score, it is going to be a good score. Maybe the depth of
field you might argue is not as deep. But golf is a funny sport.
You have 144 guys that are capable of playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting on the 10th tee Thursday, Langham birdied his first
hole with a 5-foot putt, then made a 30-footer for birdie at No.
12. After missing a 6-foot putt for bogey at No. 13, he rebounded
with a birdie at the par-3 No. 15, hitting a 7-iron tee shot to
within 4 feet of the cup, then making the putt. Langham followed
with a 15-foot putt for birdie at No. 16, and a 4-foot putt for
birdie at No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Then after a bogey at No. 2, when he failed to get up and down
from a greenside bunker, Langham birdied No. 8 with a 6-foot putt,
and No. 9 with a 12-foot putt. If Langham wins at Doral, he will
qualify for the Masters. ``It would be a thrill to play there,''
Langham said. ``Hopefully one day I will. I am planning on it.''

 &HT;    Florida OKs wholesale power unit
 &HT;    By Susan Spencer-Wendel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ State officials cracked open the door to
Florida's strictly regulated electricity market Thursday, deciding
to allow Duke Energy of North Carolina to build the state's first
wholesale power plant.
</P>
<P>
   The five members of the Public Service Commission in Tallahassee
had split votes on many of the 33 issues they considered in their
decision, but in the end they supported Duke's plan to build a
natural gas-fed, 500-megawatt plant outside New Smyrna Beach. The
plant would sell power to other utilities, including those out of
state, on an as-needed basis.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is subject to the approval of the Florida Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   With the decision, though, other utilities are expected to
pursue power plant projects of their own in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the start of new things to come. It's the first phase of
true competition,'' said Mike Bedley, president of APEX Power
Service, an energy consulting firm based in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Duke will foot the bill for the $160 million plant
_ unlike established Florida utilities that charge ratepayers for
the plant's cost _ was one of the project's selling points for PSC
Chairman Joe Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vote to be competitive,'' Garcia said. ``There will be
cheaper power to draw from . . . and that's good for Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's big investor-owned utilities, Juno Beach-based
Florida Power &AMP; Light and St. Petersburg-based Florida Progress,
vigorously opposed the idea. FPL argued that the region already has
some of the lowest electric rates in the country and that it
planned to spend $2 billion during the next decade to build plants
to meet the state's power needs.
</P>
<P>
   And while it argued against a wholesale power plant in Florida,
another FPL Group subsidiary, FPL Energy, has moved in on
deregulated markets in other states and is building wholesale
plants of its own in Texas and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   FPL spokesman Bill Swank said the company will appeal the PSC
decision.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, Duke's plant would sell about 30 percent of its
capacity to New Smyrna Beach. The rest would be sold into the
wholesale market. The company hopes to have the plant completed by
the summer of 2001, said Mike Greene, Duke's vice president for
Florida operations.
</P>
<P>
   While the PSC approved the project, commissioners expressed
concern about not letting just anyone who feels like building a
power plant into the state. Commissioners talked about working out
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to develop policy so we don't allow plants to build
willy-nilly,'' said Commissioner Susan Clark.
</P>
<P>
   But to some observers, that process seems backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``They opened the floodgates. It's too late,'' said utilities
attorney Phillip Gildan of Greenberg Traurig in West Palm Beach.
``They're going to have a tough time saying no to the next
applicant.''

BLACKMUN'S OPINIONS REFLECT HIS EVOLUTION OVER THE 24 COURT YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With OBIT-BLACKMUN) (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from opinions Justice Harry
A. Blackmun wrote in his 24 years on the Supreme Court, including
his opinion for the Court in the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade
finding a constitutional right to abortion:
</P>
<P>
   Roe v. Wade
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or
a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under
the Constitution. . . . This right of privacy, whether it be
founded in the 14th Amendment's concept of personal liberty and
restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the
District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of
rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's
decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant
woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent. Specific and
direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be
involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the
woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be
imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care.
There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the
unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a
family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for
it. In other cases, as in this one, the additional difficulties and
continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved. All these
are factors the woman and her responsible physician necessarily
will consider in consultation.
</P>
<P>
   Texas urges that, apart from the 14th Amendment, life begins at
conception and is present throughout pregnancy, and that,
therefore, the State has a compelling interest in protecting that
life from and after conception. We need not resolve the difficult
question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective
disciplines of medicine, philosophy and theology are unable to
arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the
development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate
as to the answer. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In view of all this, we do not agree that, by adopting one
theory of life, Texas may override the rights of the pregnant woman
that are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon Papers
</P>
<P>
   When in 1971 in New York Times v. U.S., the court refused the
federal government's request to block The Times and The Washington
Post from publishing excerpts from a 47-volume classified study of
the history of the war in Vietnam, Blackmun wrote this in dissent:
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment, after all, is only one part of an entire
Constitution. Article II of the great document vests in the
Executive Branch primary power over the conduct of foreign affairs
and places in that branch the responsibility for the nation's
safety. Each provision of the Constitution is important, and I
cannot subscribe to a doctrine of unlimited absolutism for the
First Amendment at the cost of downgrading other provisions. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I strongly urge, and sincerely hope, that these two newspapers
will be fully aware of their ultimate responsibilities to the
United States of America. . . . I hope that damage has not already
been done. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative Action
</P>
<P>
   In 1978 when the court ruled in Regents of the University of
California v. Bakke that a state medical school could not reserve a
fixed number of places for minorities but also said that the
Constitution permitted universities to encourage diversity through
affirmative action programs, Blackmun wrote in a partial dissent:
</P>
<P>
   I yield to no one in my earnest hope that the time will come
when an ``affirmative action'' program is unnecessary and is, in
truth, only a relic of the past. I would hope that we could reach
this stage within a decade at the most. But the story of Brown v.
Board of Education, decided almost a quarter of a century ago,
suggests that that hope is a slim one. . . .
</P>
<P>
   It is gratifying to know that the court at least finds it
constitutional for an academic institution to take race and ethnic
background into consideration as one factor, among many, in the
administration of its admissions program. I presume that that
factor always has been there, though perhaps not conceded or even
admitted. It is a fact of life, however, and a part of the real
world of which we are all a part. The sooner we get down the road
toward accepting and being a part of the real world, and not
shutting it out and away from us, the sooner will these
difficulties vanish from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that it would be impossible to arrange an
affirmative action program in a racially neutral way and have it
successful. To ask that this be so is to demand the impossible.
</P>
<P>
   In order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of
race. There is no other way. And in order to treat some persons
equally, we must treat them differently. We cannot _ we dare not _
let the Equal Protection Clause perpetrate racial supremacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Education of Aliens
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 when the court ruled in Plyler v. Doe that states must
provide a free public education to children who are illegal aliens,
Blackmun wrote in his concurring opinion:
</P>
<P>
   In my view, when the State provides an education to some and
denies it to others, it immediately and inevitably creates class
distinctions of a type fundamentally inconsistent with those
purposes, mentioned above, of the Equal Protection Clause. Children
denied an education are placed at a permanent and insurmountable
competitive disadvantage, for an uneducated child is denied even
the opportunity to achieve. And when those children are members of
an identifiable group _ through the State's action _ they will have
been converted into a discrete underclass.
</P>
<P>
   Other benefits provided by the State, such as housing and public
assistance, are of course important; to an individual in immediate
need, they may be more desirable than the right to be educated. But
classifications involving the complete denial of education are in a
sense unique, for they strike at the heart of equal protection
values by involving the State in the creation of permanent class
distinctions. In a sense, then, denial of an education is the
analogue of denial of the right to vote: the former relegates the
individual to second-class social status; the latter places him at
a permanent political disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay Rights
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 when the court ruled in Bowers v. Hardwick that the
constitutional right of privacy does not extend to homosexual
behavior, Blackmun wrote in dissent:
</P>
<P>
   The fact that individuals define themselves in a significant way
through their intimate sexual relationships with others suggests,
in a nation as diverse as ours, that there may be many ``right''
ways of conducting those relationships, and that much of the
richness of a relationship will come from the freedom an individual
has to choose the form and nature of these intensely personal
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In a variety of circumstances we have recognized that a
necessary corollary of giving individuals freedom to choose how to
conduct their lives is acceptance of the fact that different
individuals will make different choices. . . . The court claims
that its decision today merely refuses to recognize a fundamental
right to engage in homosexual sodomy; what the Court really has
refused to recognize is the fundamental interest all individuals
have in controlling the nature of their intimate associations with
others.''

 &HT;    Fla. state attorney drops retarded teen's $2 theft charge
 &HT;    By John Holland
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Facing a wealth of bad publicity over a
$2 theft, State Attorney Barry Krischer dropped all charges against
a 15-year-old mentally retarded boy Thursday as local and national
scrutiny intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Laster, who has an IQ of 58 and no criminal history, was
arrested Dec. 1 and charged with strong-armed robbery for snatching
$2 out of a classmate's pocket. He spent the next seven weeks,
including Christmas, behind bars after Krischer decided to charge
the Boynton Beach boy as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Krischer has staunchly defended his position, even as criticism
mounted from local lawyers, child advocates, voters and the media.
But Thursday, with a camera crew from 60 Minutes and local
reporters jammed into court, the state attorney reversed course.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Krischer drop the adult robbery and battery
charges, he decided not to recharge Laster as a juvenile. In a
formal court filing notable for both its length and defensive tone,
a prosecutor said the victim's testimony changed during a
deposition on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there was probable cause for the arrest and direct
filing of this case,'' prosecutor Angela Miller wrote, it was
dropped because ``the deposition of the child victim (makes) the
further prosecution of the robbery charge no longer viable.''
</P>
<P>
   The filing also said Laster's arrest and jail time may actually
help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This direct filing has brought about community interest in
providing services to this defendant, including but not limited to
the Association for Retarded Citizens and the Urban League . . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   Laster's mother died less than a month before the arrest. He
never knew his father, and his grandfather, who helped raise him,
died in May. His sister, Carolyn, is now caring for him.
</P>
<P>
   She spent Laster's entire $500 inheritance on a $5,000 bond to
free him, said attorney John Walsh of the Palm Beach County Legal
Aid Society, which filed motions to move the case to juvenile
court. The $500 will not be returned. Carolyn Laster did not return
phone calls Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this case shows (prosecutors) were wrong,'' Walsh
said. ``Looking back, it should have been handled by the principal
and the school. The family and Anthony went through a lot during
those seven weeks, and we're happy it's finally over.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress Middle School Principal Steve Sills referred questions
to Krischer.
</P>
<P>
   Krischer has maintained a strict policy that all juveniles 14 or
older accused of violent crimes would be charged as adults and said
he sees no reason to deviate. It's up to the judges whether to
punish the defendants as juveniles or adults, he said, adding only
those in the most extreme cases face convictions as adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a set-in-stone policy, and it would be ethically and
legally wrong to change on a case-by-case basis,'' said Mike
Edmondson, Krischer's spokesman. ``The intent of filing juvenile
cases in adult courts is to give them a wake-up call before they go
down the road and eventually wind up in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an attack at school, and we are not going to tolerate
that,'' Edmondson said. ``Children have the right to be safe. Our
policy is the right one, and it has worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim's father, whose son attends special education classes
with Laster, supported Krischer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not upset with Anthony _ he's a bully, but there are a lot
of bullies,'' the father said. ``What's really bad is there are
kids doing a lot worse at this middle school, and that has to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry Krischer is just sending a message, a warning, to the
other kids that they're going to jail if they start beating up and
abusing kids.''
</P>
<P>
   the father said. ``This may not be the strongest case, but it's
the right message.''

ISLES LET STARS SLIP AWAY FROM THEM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y._ There has been a recurring theme on Long Island
recently. The New York Islanders play solidly against a good team,
Thursday night the Dallas Stars, and they either don't know how to
finish them off or simply can't. Bill Stewart, the Islanders'
coach, says his team lacks ``killer instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders had the NHL's top team staggering Thursday night,
outshooting the Stars by 10-5 in the third period. But the
Islanders repeatedly failed to net those scoring chances and wound
up losing 3-2 in overtime on Joe Nieuwendyk's goal with 48 seconds
left before 9,566 fans at Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk deflected Derian Hatcher's shot from the point over
Tommy Salo, the Islanders' goaltender, who was screened. The
Islanders were outshot, 6-1, in the extra session.
</P>
<P>
   Zigmund Palffy scored both goals for the Islanders. David Reid,
Mike Modano and Nieuwendyk scored for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders had their chances late in regulation. Early in the
third period, they got their first opportunity to steal a victory,
in the form of a 2-on-1 rush. Claude Lapointe, flanked by Sergei
Nemchinov, carried the puck into Dallas' zone.. But Nemchinov
couldn't handle Lapointe's cross-ice pass, although Roman Turek,
the Stars' goalie, would have been beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the third period, Lapointe had a breakaway but was poke
checked by Turek before getting a chance to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders were up against the NHL's best Thursday night. The
Stars, who were coming off of Tuesday's 2-2 tie against the Rangers
at Madison Square Garden, entered the game with the most victories
(38) and fewest losses (11). Dallas had twice as many victories as
the Islanders before Thursday night's face off.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders outworked the Stars early in the game and managed
to escape the first period with the score tied at 1-1. New York
outshot Dallas 11-7 during the opening 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas got the game's first goal from Reid at 3:27 on a
redirection of a shot by Mike Keane. Skating through the middle as
Keane fired a sharp angle shot from the corner, Reid jabbed his
stick at the puck, tipping it over Salo's glove.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders came back on a power-play goal, scored by Palffy
at 18:29. After two unsuccessful swipes at the puck by Trevor
Linden and three more by Robert Reichel, Palffy finally buried it.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, the Islanders took an early 2-1 lead, but
the Stars evened matters.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy's second goal of the game put the Islanders ahead at
6:46. He was in the right place at the right time, coming out of
the penalty box when the puck hopped over the stick of Stars
defenseman Richard Matvichuk and through center ice. Palffy picked
up the errant pass and skated in on Turek. Palffy went forehand,
backhand and forehand again before shooting the puck over Turek.
</P>
<P>
   Modano's goal at 17:05 tied the game at 2-2. Modano redirected a
shot by Hatcher from the point past Salo.

 &HT;    Air Force cuts loom large in research division
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will lose 474
civilian jobs beginning in October from a combination of previously
announced management changes and the Air Force's recent decision to
heavily emphasize space programs over other types of research,
officials announced late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A broad array of positions will be eliminated, but the largest
chunk _ 163 _ will come out of the Air Force Research Laboratory
headquartered at the base, even though the lab cuts are the result
of an Air Force budget that's still being hotly contested on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In the spending plan the Air Force submitted to Congress in
February, two enormous space-based programs, a laser and a radar,
were moved into the service's Science and Technology budget. But no
extra money was added to pay for them, so other projects were
slashed to make room.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress is only in the early stages of its budget hearing
process, and has the authority to rewrite the Air Force priority
list. As late as Wednesday, some on Capitol Hill were hoping the
Air Force would postpone an announcement on laboratory job cuts,
since the budget that dictates them is months from being finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Miami Valley congressional delegation, joined by
congressmen from other states with military research facilities,
have furiously exchanged letters of warning with the Pentagon about
the strategic danger of draining scientific research accounts in
the 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters on Thursday
acknowledged the pressure Congress has exerted in recent weeks, but
suggested that doesn't change the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's actually shown me where the extra money would come
from,'' Peters said. ``There are some pieces of this we wouldn't
mind buying back.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, D-Dayton, sees it a little differently.
With so much unified opposition to the assault on Science and
Research accounts, he said he thinks Congress will find a way to
save some lost research programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year the Ohio delegation was successful in restoring cuts
in materials research,,'' Hall said. ``Working together I believe
we can add back money for some of the highest priority science
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Curtis, who is vice president of the Miami Valley Economic
Development Coalition, hopes Hall is right. The high-tech, high
education jobs at the research lab are precisely the kinds of jobs
that make bolster the Miami Valley's claim to having a kind of
military brain trust around which to build commercial high-tech
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force appears to be suggesting cuts prior to
congressional consideration of the president's budget,'' Curtis
said. ``That seems a bit premature.''
</P>
<P>
   The cuts were announced in conjunction with the unveiling of a
vast redrawing of the Air Force combat structure. Last August, the
Air Force announced plans to create 10 Air Expeditionary Forces
that will be comprised of units on different bases across the
globe, with each AEF taking its turn on 15-month deployment duty.
Thursday, the Air Force revealed the details of the new structure,
which is designed to give more military units longer rest periods
and more predictable deployment schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Officials couldn't say Thursday evening how many of the 474 job
losses at Wright-Pat were for positions that are currently
unfilled, and in the process of restructuring its combat forces the
Air Force will boost its military personnel at Wright-Pat by 33
under the program just announced.
</P>
<P>
   The additions come in the 88th Communications Squadron, which
will pick up 14 military spots, and the National Air Intelligence
Center and 694th Intelligence Group, which adds 45 military
positions to its payroll.
</P>
<P>
   The other job losses come from across the base spectrum. The Air
Force Institute of Technology, which just last year seemed headed
for complete destruction, will lose 15 military and seven civilian
positions as part of the compromise brokered last spring to keep it
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Materiel Command, headquartered at Wright-Pat, will
lose 41 military and 74 civilian positions as part of the
Pentagon's continuing effort to wither administrative command posts
in favor of beefing up field operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Aeronautical Systems Center will lose 7 military and 93
civilian jobs as a result of decreased workloads in the Foreign
Military Sales Program. The acquisition work force, which has been
another favorite target of Pentagon budget snippers and is a
mainstay of Wright-Pat's payroll, is scheduled to lose 13 military
and 114 civilian positions.
</P>
<P>
   But even Air Force leaders have admitted they use a broad
definition of ``acquisition'' workers that includes research
laboratory personnel and others not directly involved in Air Force
procurement programs. It was not clear Thursday night how many of
those being cut from as part of the Pentagon squeeze on acquisition
payrolls are truly acquistion-specific workers at Wright-Pat.
</P>
<P>
   For Curtis, that almost doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first concern,'' Curtis said, ``is that Wright-Pat seems
to be the bank for personnel cuts, taking more than its fair
share.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, hundreds of jobs of been siphoned away during
the military's extensive draw down, which has put a premium on
combat-immediate positions and let the support work of places such
as Wright-Pat take the brunt of overall reductions.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Wright-Pat's bread-and-butter science jobs that will be
the most painful to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the immediate economic impact,'' Curtis said, ``then
there's the loss of intellectual capital, which is a little hard to
measure. But then, if you begin to lose critical mass in certain
that's an economic concern for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's precisely the argument Hall and others on Capitol
Hill want to wage with the Air Force: that by abandoning basic
research programs now, the Air Force will cut its way out of the
innovation business and lose the technological superiority it has
enjoyed for decades.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, who has been a chief
correspondent in recent letters to the Pentagon complaining about
the loss of science money, said he fears the Air Force isn't
considering the long term effect of its budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would lose not just good people, but unequaled expertise,''
he said. ``You cannot restore lost expertise overnight. ``It takes
time to build and develop this military brainpower.''

HOW UGLY CAN IT GET? DON'T ASK THE NETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It is official. The players, the fans,
the analysts and whoever else predicted success for this season's
Nets were deluded.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets are simply a weak basketball team. What else do you
call a collection of players that lets one of the lowliest teams in
the National Basketball Association strut into its house and whip
it?
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte Hornets _ who entered with a 3-10 record, with its
stars Glen Rice and Anthony Mason on the injured list, with
haggardly, Chuck Person, 34, starting at small forward _ beat the
Nets, 96-82. Do not be fooled by the score. This game was never
that close.
</P>
<P>
   But the loss might not be the worst news for the Nets, who sank
to 3-12. Jayson Williams, who had played all season with ligament
damage in his left thumb, injured the thumb badly in the second
quarter. He was taken to a hospital at halftime and did not play in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The injury probably occurred when the former Net Derrick Coleman
dunked ferociously on Williams 3 minutes 27 seconds before
intermission to put Charlotte ahead by 50-39.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets, who were crushed last week by the lifeless Chicago
Bulls, put the Nets in a 17-point hole after just 6:58 of the
opening quarter. They increased that to 25 in the third quarter
before the Nets tried to charge in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Person was Charlotte's unlikely leader, scoring 21 points while
hitting five of seven 3-pointers. Bobby Phills followed with 20
points. The Hornets made 10 of 22 3-pointers. The Nets, looking
pitiful despite playing in their new and fashionable gray
sleeveless uniforms, were led by Keith Van Horn's 28 points. Kerry
Kittles added 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets started by taking a 7-5 lead on a 3-pointer by Kittles,
then collapsed like a house of cards. Making Person and Phills look
like two of the NBA's finest, the Nets were outscored by 22-3 over
the next five minutes as the Hornets took a 27-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the run took place against Coach John Calipari's
much-anticipated big lineup, which he had talked about after
Tuesday's loss to Milwaukee. With his club trailing by 10-7,
Calipari inserted forward Chris Gatling for point guard Eric
Murdock, giving him Kittles, Kendall Gill, Van Horn, Gatling and
Williams on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Charlotte, a small, but not necessarily fast, team,
turned into the sprinting Minnesota Timberwolves. Hitting layups
and dunks while running and 3-pointers while setting up, they
outscored the Nets by 17-3 before Calipari went back to a smaller
lineup less than four minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Phills, who scored Charlotte's first 8 points, started the spurt
with a 3-pointer before Person began asserting himself. Making the
Nets pay dearly for their molasses-slow rotations, Person nailed
four 3-pointers during the opening period, including three during
the overwhelming run, to finish with 14 first-quarter points.
</P>
<P>
   Person's shooting was no surprise; the 12-year veteran has
always been able to stroke it. But the first 12 minutes were so
lopsided that the notoriously one-dimensional player dazzled in
other areas. Moments after sinking his first 3-pointer, he tossed a
nice alley-oop pass to a rising Coleman, who dunked it with
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The carefree play was a sign of things to come, as David Wesley
felt comfortable enough to give an underhand pass to Phills for a
fastbreak dunk less than two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after falling behind by 27-10, the Nets showed some
pride and ended the quarter with a 12-6 run to pull to within
33-22. The Hornets, making six of seven 3-pointers, shot 68 percent
in the first quarter.

<P>
   An angry Van Horn scored 10 second-quarter points to spark a
Nets rally that pulled them to within 50-45 just 1:47 before the
half, but Charlotte scored 8 of the next 10 points to lead by 58-45
at the break. The Hornets were so charmed that Brad Miller, a
6-foot-11-inch rookie from Purdue, nailed a 27-footer at the
halftime buzzer.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    From time to time, every writer, no matter how successful and
famous, no matter the genre, needs the creative company of fellow
writers. As a journalist, a member of the editorial board of the
St. Petersburg Times, I am around newswriting and news-hound types
nearly every day.
 &HT;    Sometimes, though, I have the good fortune of experiencing
quality time with non-journalists, as I did a few days ago when I
heard noted black feminist theorist bell hooks (she spells her name
in the lowercase for symbolic and substantive reasons) speak at the
University of South Florida in Tampa. The highlight of the day, of
course, was having dinner with hooks, at the invitation of
Professor Gary Olson, coordinator of the university's graduate
program of rhetoric and composition.
 &HT;    In addition to motivating me to write more, hooks, 45, has
inspired me to think deeper. Most significantly, though, she has
helped me to understand better my role as a black male writer.
Instead of simply reporting _ which I try to avoid as a columnist _
I should take my observations to the next level: I should be
theorizing about blackness, especially black maleness.
 &HT;    What is the essence of being a black male in America, in a
nation that has criminalized black male masculinity, that perceives
us as exotic outsiders?
 &HT;    Sure, I have wrestled with this issue in some columns, but I
have only scratched the surface. I suspect that I have not gone
deeper because newspapers as a medium frown on complex ideas
expressed in complex language.
 &HT;    Then, again, perhaps I have been too afraid to confront
blackness _ my own in particular _ in all of its contours and
nuances, too afraid to look inside the recesses where simple truths
are more frightening than the vast unknown.
 &HT;    The whole world, especially America, has much to learn from
blackness, hooks said. To understand U.S. culture at all, in fact,
we need to understand blackness.
 &HT;    A main problem, obviously, is the dearth of black writers,
especially males, willing to open their veins and let the ideas,
secrets, frustrations and theories flow before a society that has
been instinctively hostile to these men's very existence.
 &HT;    But someone must write about the black male condition that few
dare to explore. How can a white man know himself without
understanding that his vision of himself and his world depends in
large measure on his relations with blacks and his perceptions of
who and what blacks are? My job as a black writer, then, is to show
white people that their existence is my existence, that their
whiteness is what it is because of my blackness.
 &HT;    Affirmative action, for example _ seen by many whites as a
program giving pathetic, unqualified blacks, especially black
males, a leg up over white males _ is as much of a way to help
blacks as it is a painless way for white people to redeem their
race for centuries of inhumanity against an entire class of
citizens. Seen in this way, affirmative action is not a black or a
white program. It is an American program, a buffer, a neutral place
where right and wrong intersect for the purpose of moral healing
and establishing long-overdue fairness.
 &HT;    Part of my job as a writer is to show that black males are a
redacted class crying out for affirmation, and part of my job is to
theorize as to why we are shadowy lines, blurred or invisible
characters and abbreviated images beneath the pitch-black ink on
the page. Our faces have no definition and, therefore, we all look
alike. Our voices are barely audible and, therefore, we all sound
the same. Society knows that we are there _ or that we have been
there. But no one can touch us. We have been driven back, smudged.
 &HT;    Here, I am reminded of a James Baldwin comment that offers a
hooks-type vision of the black male in the United States, a vision
that addresses both the predicament and the endurance of the black
male: ``A stranger to this planet might find the fact that there
are so many black (men) at all still alive in America something to
write home about. I, myself, find it remarkable not that so many
black men were forced (and in so many ways) to leave their
families, but that so many remained and aided their issue to grow
and flourish.''
 &HT;    Such discourse needs to be written, and, thanks to hooks, I
shall add my voice more often. A real danger in trying to give
voice to blackness is being accused of anger, self-pity, victimhood
and, yes, racism. But hooks showed me in her speech that such risks
must be taken if the nation is to develop the will and the stomach
to understand the scope of its damnable treatment of blacks,
especially males, and to find ways of reversing the damage.
 &HT;    I do not know if hooks intended to inspire me or anyone else in
that packed auditorium the other day. Nor do I know if I have
correctly interpreted the part of her message that I have
discussed. The good thing is that she has renewed my courage and
determination _ as a black male writer _ to help white America come
to terms with its legacy of racism and its need to understand that
black maleness is every American's concern.

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SIOUX FALLS, S. D. _ The state of South Dakota is divided by the
Missouri River. We have a North and South Dakota. But there are
those who believe we should have an East and West Dakota. The
people living on opposite sides of the river are oftentimes quite
different.
 &HT;    Dakota Territory was named after the Indian people first
encountered by the early explorers. The people they met called
themselves Dakota. If the settlers had come from the west instead
of the east, the first people they met would have Lakota. We would
then have had Lakota Territory which would have become North and
South Lakota.
 &HT;    It's a matter of dialect. The people (Oyate) living in the
western part of the territory spoke Lakota. The people in the east
spoke Dakota. The Lakota, or Titonwan (``People of the Prairie'')
called Teton by early Canadians and Americans, consisted of the
Oglala (Crazy Horse and Red Cloud were Oglala), Brule or Rosebud
(Spotted Tail), Hunkpapa (Sitting Bull), Miniconju, Sans Arc and
Two Kettle (Cheyenne River). All spoke Lakota.
 &HT;    A Lakota said ``Hau kola,'' or ``Hello friend.'' A Dakota said
``Hau koda.'' Where a Lakota used an ``L'' a Dakota used a ``D.''
We (Lakota) joke amongst ourselves saying, ``When a Lakota man is
enamored of a maiden he says `I love you.''' A Dakota man says `I
dove you.'''
 &HT;    So, even thousands of years ago the river that split the state
also divided a people. East of the river were the Mdewakanton
(``People of Spirit Lake''), Wahpekute (``The Leaf Shooters''),
Wahpeton (``The People on Lake Traversie''), and the Sisitonwanna,
or Sisseton (``People of the Marsh''). Combined, all of these
tribes were called the Santee just as the tribes of the west were
called the Teton.
 &HT;    In the east were also the Ihanktonwan, or Yankton (``People of
the End''), and the Ihanktonwanna, or Yanktonai (``The Little
Yankton''). The people of these tribes, though still a part of what
later became the Great Sioux Nation, spoke with an ``N'' dialect.
For ``friend'' they would say ``kona.'' All of the tribes mentioned
were later called ``Sioux'' by the white settlers.
 &HT;    Sioux was a word first used by the French fur trappers. They
took two words from the Algonquin language, nadowe (snake) and
sioux (little) and used this name which was popular among the
Ojibwa (Chippewa), enemies of the Sioux. The name means ``Little
Snake.''
 &HT;    As the late Enos Poor Bear, former president of the Oglala Sioux
Tribe, (a Lakota man who always referred to himself as ``Sioux'')
said, ``Maybe the name given us _ Sioux _ was meant to be
derogatory, but we became such fierce warriors that our enemies
trembled in their shoes or moccasins when they heard the ``Sioux''
were coming. Pretty soon the word Sioux was spoken with pride by
our people and with fear by our enemies.''
 &HT;    The Big Sioux River flows through the heart of Sioux Falls. The
majestic falls at its center gives the city its name, ``Sioux
Falls.'' If the name ``Sioux'' is a misnomer then it stands to
reason that the river would have been called the Big Dakota River
and the city would have been Dakota Falls if the early settlers
were linguistically and historically correct.
 &HT;    When the national elections roll around the people of East River
(as opposed to West River) control the votes because of their much
larger population base. Politically, the folks of East River are
just a little more liberal than those of the West River. To the
Indian people this translates into a lot less prejudiced.
 &HT;    On weekends, particularly long ones, the city of Sioux Falls has
a dramatic increase in its Indian population because many Indians
travel from the larger reservations west of the river to shop and
seek entertainment in this larger, erroneously named city.
 &HT;    I have been on sabbatical since the beginning of the year. After
selling the newspaper I began 18 years ago, Indian County Today,
and moving from Rapid City to Sioux Falls _ it's great to be back.
 &HT;    East of the river is good.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    On Jan. 9, 1977 I thought that the hours, let alone days, would
never pass.
 &HT;    Suddenly, 22 years have gone by.
 &HT;    Grief, I once heard, is like the volume knob on a radio: When a
loved one dies, the loudness reaches its peak. Over time, the
intensity eases; at last, the sound drops below hearing range.
 &HT;    Then, one day, something _ a photograph or a melody _ appears
out of the blue and increases the volume again.
 &HT;    Up, down. Down and up.
 &HT;    Grief may fade, but it never goes away.
 &HT;    That first February without my sister Sonja, my sister Karen
wrote a poem to honor what would have been her 37th birthday. The
verse was the first of many, as we _ Karen and, eventually, Mother
and I _ poured our grief into poetry.
 &HT;    Yet the vessel was not large enough to hold the pain.
 &HT;    From the moment my father's call came, forever dividing time in
two (``before Sonja died/after Sonja died''), I fell into a barren
land. Plucked from my life, I plummeted downward, like Alice, into
another.
 &HT;    I talked mainly of Sonja, thought about her even more, during
the first year and longer. I felt different, the sharp pains in my
chest sending me to the doctor.
 &HT;    As gently as he could, he said: ``Grief is painful, physically
and emotionally painful.''
 &HT;    I even wore her sweater to feel closer to her, her coat to
button up my hurt.
 &HT;    My friend Marge, marveling at my obsession, took the opposite
route.
 &HT;    Her mother died of cancer the same day as Sonja left the world,
but Marge had mourned the impending death for so long, that after
the funeral she tried putting grief in its place. She gave away
most of her mother's possessions and got on with her life.
 &HT;    With Sonja, we hadn't had time for a farewell, hadn't talked of
her being ill _ much less close to death. So I set about giving a
long goodbye, not just to her but to the part of me that died with
her.
 &HT;    I read book after book on death and dying. I slept in her old
room whenever I returned home and rummaged through the relics of
her childhood in the attic.
 &HT;    A couple of times, when I knew that my brother-in-law would have
left for work, I called the apartment he had shared with Sonja. In
an era long before answering machines, there was no thought of
hearing her voice once again. I just wanted the telephone to ring
where she had laughed, cooked, lived. A part of me hoped that all
of a sudden she'd answer _ and I'd awake from a horrible dream.
 &HT;    I cannot say when I took the first step back, nor how long the
trip lasted. I know only that I had to pass through grief's wintry
door. Death had slammed shut the one to Sonja, refusing to open it.
 &HT;    Eventually, the dirge quieted; The hours quickened. Now, more
than two decades have disappeared. Hard to imagine she would have
turned 59 this month. Feb. 11 came and went without a poem, though
I did send a `Sonia' rose to Mom. Hard to believe that Karen just
paid me a visit and, instead of talking nonstop about our sister,
we discussed her only twice.
 &HT;    Yet even when the volume and frequency subside, grief still
hurts.
 &HT;    I once railed against the last lines in ``Out, Out'': ``And
they, since they/ &HT;    Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs.''
 &HT;    How could poet Robert Frost write such cold words? How could
``they,'' a boy's parents and sister, possibly turn to their
affairs?
 &HT;    The years have answered the questions and taught me something
else: Sonja was waiting right there inside me all the time. As the
music _ lovely, grateful tunes of everything we'd shared _ started
to play more softly, I could finally hear her.
 &HT;    The other day as Karen was leaving, I asked her to let me know
when she got to Peru. Checking e-mail, I found her missive. Then,
out of habit, without a computer or a second thought, I sent a
message even farther: ``Sonja: Karen arrived safely.''

 By PRADNYA JOSHI 
 c. 1999 A. Magazine 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Marriage. Just the sound of the word used to make me shudder.
The very thought of changing the life I've been struggling to build
for myself, the thought of doing it again with somebody else. It's
yet another huge endeavor.
 &HT;    And I'm sure that I will never be able to recognize THE time
when I'm actually ready. But after the last two years of living
alone in a large metropolis, I'm beginning to feel pangs of
loneliness that the company of my friends can't quite alleviate.
 &HT;    Despite this realization, I still continue to duck the ``big
talk'' with my parents. But on the day of my 27th birthday, my
mother put her heel (if not her entire foot) down on the matter.
There was no easy way out, and we were going to have a serious
heart-to-heart about the big ``A-word.''
 &HT;    ``So what is so wrong with an arranged marriage?'' my mother
wants to know.
 &HT;    I know I'm not alone in this. There are many second-generation
Indian Americans who find that the question travels across the seas
to perch persistently on their doorsteps _ so long as the parents
``believe.'' I'm not here to demonize the practice. I'm just saying
that it isn't for me.
 &HT;    ``It's just like interviewing someone for a job,'' pleads my
mother incessantly. ``You receive the resumes, you interview the
candidates, and then you pick one. Your company does that all the
time!''
 &HT;    And, she adds as she cites the latest figures on American
divorce rates, there is no guarantee that a marriage founded on
love is forever anyway.
 &HT;    My mother, a highly educated and competent woman, is also a
woman caught up in some old-world paranoia. She's not alone in
believing that here in the United States, there is usually
dishonesty lurking behind every bush and that risking her daughters
to the promiscuous ways of American society is beyond justifiable.
 &HT;    On that particular subject though, I like to think I know a
little better. I've always felt secure in my judgment of people's
characters and kept alive the hope that the
friendship-to-dates-to-love-to-marriage method will ensure a secure
``forever'' union.
 &HT;    But to be fair, I do find some intrigue in the centuries-old
tradition. I can fashion myself as a female Pygmalion carving out a
partner with qualities that are comparable with mine, while my
parents emulate Aphrodite by bringing such a person to life. And,
honestly, there are also times when I fancy that such a path would
also be much less painful than the Western way to which I so
stubbornly cling.
 &HT;    So I've been flirting with a combination of the here and there
by dating Indian-American-style. This incorporates a method whereby
Indian parents place a guantity of taboos on their children's
lifestyles, thus offering an entirely unique dimension to an
already angst-filled process.
 &HT;    The typical Indian American ``date,'' you see, usually doesn't
involve the romantically wined and dined evenings. Rather, we tend
to play a game of 20 Questions while out as `friends.' Within a few
short hours, we drill out everything from favorite colors to
summaries of where each wants to be in the next two decades and the
game plan for getting there _ this and more while both parties are
clearly sizing one another up without ever admitting it. Painful.
 &HT;    So, what about hitting the singles bars? I'd have to say that
I'm already weary of the scene. And unlike some of my ``magnetic''
girlfriends, strange men seldom approach me with one-liners that
compare my eyes to ocean waves as they hand me their phone numbers.
 &HT;    But that's just the initial meeting. The actual date,
American-style, is a dance of its own without manual or manuscript.
Sure, some of my friends have referred to the dating bible so
coolly titled ``The Rules,'' but the tome is hardly an accurate
guide for a generation of women who've been raised on the spunk of
Princess Leia rather than the purr of Donna Reed. I've also heard
of more contemporary versions like ``What Men Want,'' which also
purports to assist one's trek through the dating jungle.
 &HT;    But the only real truths I've discovered so far come from the
humor of Dave Barry's ``Complete Guide to Guys,'' where Dave so
cleverly compares the male mind with that of some four-legged
friends. So with Dave's insight at hand, I continue venturing out
into the world of girl-meets-boy.
 &HT;    But for me, dating a man with Western mores brings its own woes.
Case in point: Once, over dinner, I told a dashing young man that I
volunteer at an organization that assists women from violent homes.
In response he asked me whether I considered myself a
``man-hater.'' Now, would a nice Indian boy have been so insolent?
 &HT;    Questions like that actually lead me to reconsider arranged
marriages. What my parents have in mind, after all, is for the good
of everybody in the family. In their eyes, the suitable mate would
be an upstanding young man with a solid education, coming from a
good family. He would also have the same ethnic, linguistic and, of
course, religious background as mine.
 &HT;    To find a suitable match old-world-style entails a complicated
system of collecting curriculum vitaes and resumes, which list
attributes such as occupation, education, build, parents'
backgrounds and _ for some _ caste and sub-caste. And this list is
by no means exhaustive. On the home front, the collected bio-data
on important traits are carefully weighed out while the parents
chat with other Indian parents for the ``real scoop'' beyond what
is in writing. I guess you can say that this is less superficial
than sizing someone up at a party. At least it is straightforward.
No confusion about motives here. And ultimately, this route just
might be a much easier one to navigate than the conventional
Western ways of pairing up.
 &HT;    I may also be too much of a pragmatic to ever fully believe that
a good marriage is based purely on passion and allure. A foundation
for a lasting relationship must include an understanding of one's
roots.
 &HT;    In my case, it is important to me that I marry a
second-generation Indian American. So far that has been the easy
part. But I have less than a stellar track record in finding
someone who is otherwise ``my type.'' I've always believed in
certain Indian traditions (like karma, for example), so it surely
wouldn't be such a leap to believe that it is my parents who will
ultimately tie my destiny in marriage.
 &HT;    Perhaps the men in the game have the right idea. Some Indian
American men I know see arranged marriage as a convenient fall-back
option; if they don't find someone they love, at least they can ask
for someone they can tolerate. For women though, the entire affair
still carries the stigma of resignation to a life of subservience
and can serve as a painful reminder of women's roles in a
patriarchal world.
 &HT;    No one ever promised me the glass-slipper version of life. But
in the end, I'm still hoping that maybe, just maybe, I'll find
Prince Charming, fall in love and live happily ever after _ without
first asking for his picture and resume.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Marriage. Just the sound of the word used to make me shudder.
The very thought of changing the life I've been struggling to build
for myself, the thought of doing it again with somebody else. It's
yet another huge endeavor.
 &HT;    And I'm sure that I will never be able to recognize THE time
when I'm actually ready. But after the last two years of living
alone in a large metropolis, I'm beginning to feel pangs of
loneliness that the company of my friends can't quite alleviate.
 &HT;    Despite this realization, I still continue to duck the ``big
talk'' with my parents. But on the day of my 27th birthday, my
mother put her heel (if not her entire foot) down on the matter.
There was no easy way out, and we were going to have a serious
heart-to-heart about the big ``A-word.''
 &HT;    ``So what is so wrong with an arranged marriage?'' my mother
wants to know.
 &HT;    I know I'm not alone in this. There are many second-generation
Indian Americans who find that the question travels across the seas
to perch persistently on their doorsteps _ so long as the parents
``believe.'' I'm not here to demonize the practice. I'm just saying
that it isn't for me.
 &HT;    ``It's just like interviewing someone for a job,'' pleads my
mother incessantly. ``You receive the resumes, you interview the
candidates, and then you pick one. Your company does that all the
time!''
 &HT;    And, she adds as she cites the latest figures on American
divorce rates, there is no guarantee that a marriage founded on
love is forever anyway.
 &HT;    My mother, a highly educated and competent woman, is also a
woman caught up in some old-world paranoia. She's not alone in
believing that here in the United States, there is usually
dishonesty lurking behind every bush and that risking her daughters
to the promiscuous ways of American society is beyond justifiable.
 &HT;    On that particular subject though, I like to think I know a
little better. I've always felt secure in my judgment of people's
characters and kept alive the hope that the
friendship-to-dates-to-love-to-marriage method will ensure a secure
``forever'' union.
 &HT;    But to be fair, I do find some intrigue in the centuries-old
tradition. I can fashion myself as a female Pygmalion carving out a
partner with qualities that are comparable with mine, while my
parents emulate Aphrodite by bringing such a person to life. And,
honestly, there are also times when I fancy that such a path would
also be much less painful than the Western way to which I so
stubbornly cling.
 &HT;    So I've been flirting with a combination of the here and there
by dating Indian-American-style. This incorporates a method whereby
Indian parents place a guantity of taboos on their children's
lifestyles, thus offering an entirely unique dimension to an
already angst-filled process.
 &HT;    The typical Indian American ``date,'' you see, usually doesn't
involve the romantically wined and dined evenings. Rather, we tend
to play a game of 20 Questions while out as `friends.' Within a few
short hours, we drill out everything from favorite colors to
summaries of where each wants to be in the next two decades and the
game plan for getting there _ this and more while both parties are
clearly sizing one another up without ever admitting it. Painful.
 &HT;    So, what about hitting the singles bars? I'd have to say that
I'm already weary of the scene. And unlike some of my ``magnetic''
girlfriends, strange men seldom approach me with one-liners that
compare my eyes to ocean waves as they hand me their phone numbers.
 &HT;    But that's just the initial meeting. The actual date,
American-style, is a dance of its own without manual or manuscript.
Sure, some of my friends have referred to the dating bible so
coolly titled ``The Rules,'' but the tome is hardly an accurate
guide for a generation of women who've been raised on the spunk of
Princess Leia rather than the purr of Donna Reed. I've also heard
of more contemporary versions like ``What Men Want,'' which also
purports to assist one's trek through the dating jungle.
 &HT;    But the only real truths I've discovered so far come from the
humor of Dave Barry's ``Complete Guide to Guys,'' where Dave so
cleverly compares the male mind with that of some four-legged
friends. So with Dave's insight at hand, I continue venturing out
into the world of girl-meets-boy.
 &HT;    But for me, dating a man with Western mores brings its own woes.
Case in point: Once, over dinner, I told a dashing young man that I
volunteer at an organization that assists women from violent homes.
In response he asked me whether I considered myself a
``man-hater.'' Now, would a nice Indian boy have been so insolent?
 &HT;    Questions like that actually lead me to reconsider arranged
marriages. What my parents have in mind, after all, is for the good
of everybody in the family. In their eyes, the suitable mate would
be an upstanding young man with a solid education, coming from a
good family. He would also have the same ethnic, linguistic and, of
course, religious background as mine.
 &HT;    To find a suitable match old-world-style entails a complicated
system of collecting curriculum vitaes and resumes, which list
attributes such as occupation, education, build, parents'
backgrounds and _ for some _ caste and sub-caste. And this list is
by no means exhaustive. On the home front, the collected bio-data
on important traits are carefully weighed out while the parents
chat with other Indian parents for the ``real scoop'' beyond what
is in writing. I guess you can say that this is less superficial
than sizing someone up at a party. At least it is straightforward.
No confusion about motives here. And ultimately, this route just
might be a much easier one to navigate than the conventional
Western ways of pairing up.
 &HT;    I may also be too much of a pragmatic to ever fully believe that
a good marriage is based purely on passion and allure. A foundation
for a lasting relationship must include an understanding of one's
roots.
 &HT;    In my case, it is important to me that I marry a
second-generation Indian American. So far that has been the easy
part. But I have less than a stellar track record in finding
someone who is otherwise ``my type.'' I've always believed in
certain Indian traditions (like karma, for example), so it surely
wouldn't be such a leap to believe that it is my parents who will
ultimately tie my destiny in marriage.
 &HT;    Perhaps the men in the game have the right idea. Some Indian
American men I know see arranged marriage as a convenient fall-back
option; if they don't find someone they love, at least they can ask
for someone they can tolerate. For women though, the entire affair
still carries the stigma of resignation to a life of subservience
and can serve as a painful reminder of women's roles in a
patriarchal world.
 &HT;    No one ever promised me the glass-slipper version of life. But
in the end, I'm still hoping that maybe, just maybe, I'll find
Prince Charming, fall in love and live happily ever after _ without
first asking for his picture and resume.

   FINDING THE COURAGE TO CONFRONT BLACKNESS. What is the essence
of being a black male in America, in a nation that has criminalized
black male masculinity, that perceives them as exotic outsiders?
ponders columnist Bill Maxwell. ``Perhaps I have been too afraid to
confront blackness _ my own in particular _ in all of its contours
and nuances, too afraid to look inside the recesses where simple
truths are more frightening than the vast unknown,'' he writes.
``But, to understand U.S. culture at all, we need to understand
blackness.''

   ALL ABOUT THE DAKOTA, THE LAKOTA AND THE SIOUX. The state of
South Dakota is divided by the Missouri River. There is a North and
South Dakota. But there are those who believe we should have an
East and West Dakota, suggests columnist Tim giago. The people
living on opposite sides of the river, he says, are oftentimes
quite different. Dakota Territory was named after the Indian people
first encountered by the early explorers. The people they met
called themselves Dakota. ``If the settlers had come from the west
instead of the east, the first people they met would have been
Lakota,'' Giago writes. ``Then we would have had a North and South
Lakota.''

   GRIEF MAY FADE, BUT IT NEVER GOES AWAY. From the moment her

a barren land. Plucked from her life, she plummeted downward, like
Alice, into another, she recalls. ``With Sonja, we hadn't had time
for a farewell, hadn't talked of her being ill _ much less close to
death. So I set about giving a long goodbye, not just to her but to
the part of me that died with her,'' she writes. ``I cannot say
when I took the first step back, nor how long the trip lasted. I
know only that I had to pass through grief's wintry door.''

speed up on the dating track, or would an arranged marriage be the

gives her spin on the process. ``There are many second-generation

of action. But secretly, she hopes love will win the debate in her

   ALL ABOUT THE DAKOTA, THE LAKOTA AND THE SIOUX. The state of
South Dakota is divided by the Missouri River. There is a North and
South Dakota. But there are those who believe we should have an
East and West Dakota, suggests columnist Tim giago. The people
living on opposite sides of the river, he says, are oftentimes
quite different. Dakota Territory was named after the Indian people
first encountered by the early explorers. The people they met
called themselves Dakota. ``If the settlers had come from the west
instead of the east, the first people they met would have been
Lakota,'' Giago writes. ``Then we would have had a North and South

RANGERS CONTINUE THEIR PLAYOFF PUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Teams like the New York Rangers and the Washington
Capitals, which might not make the Stanley Cup playoffs but still
have a chance to qualify, tend to play in postseason mode during
the last quarter of the regular schedule. That is the way they
competed Thursday night at the MCI Center, and the Rangers came
from behind late to emerge with a dramatic 4-2 victory over
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict moved the Rangers into a tie with Florida for ninth
place in the Eastern Conference, only two points behind the Boston
Bruins, who hold the eighth and final playoff berth in the Eastern
Conference, with 20 games to go. The Rangers have a four-game
undefeated streak and are 6-2-1 in their last nine. They are two
games below .500 and seem to be gaining momentum even with four key
players out with injuries: Wayne Gretzky, Todd Harvey, Petr Popovic
and Jeff Beukeboom.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Knuble scored two goals for the Rangers, who tallied three
goals in the final five minutes after they were behind by 2-1. Adam
Graves and Niklas Sundstrom got the others, with Graves getting
what amounted to the game-winner on a rebound 3 minutes 32 seconds
from the end of the third period. Graves pounced upon a loose puck
after Peter Nedved's shot was knocked down by the hand of
Washington defenseman Ken Klee. It was Graves' 31st goal of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Checking was tight and effort evident throughout. Petr Bondra
gave Washington a 2-1 lead at 9:03 of the third period on a
power-play goal with nine seconds remaining in a penalty to Ulf
Samuelsson. Mike Richter, the Ranger goalie, stopped the original
shot by Sergei Gonchar. But neither Richter nor his defense was
able to control the rebound, which Bondra knocked in from short
range for his 30th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Knuble tied it at 15:31 with a slap shot from the right-wing
circle after Brian Leetch created the chance with skating and
passing from the neutral zone. Graves then untied it for good.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers went into the game with the third-best penalty
killing record in the National Hockey League. They played well
while short handed for most of the first two periods Thursday
night, killing off six minutes of disadvantage. But their efforts
broke down shortly before the second intermission and the Capitals
took a 1-0 lead on a power-play goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got one back at even strength early in the third
period to tie the score and set up a tense finish.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring for the Capitals at 15:39 of the second period was
defenseman Sergei Gonchar, who drifted down the right side and beat
Richter with a shot from the circle after a pass across the zone
from Jaroslav Svejkovsky. The Capitals had the extra man because
Mathieu Schneider of the Rangers was in the penalty box for
boarding Kelly Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the period, the Rangers killed off a four-minute
power play after defenseman Chris Tamer got a double minor for
high-sticking Svejkovsky and cutting his face.
</P>
<P>
   Richter was sharp on many Capitals scoring chances. One of the
most dangerous came on hard shot by Bondra after Samuelsson turned
over the puck in the second minute of the second period. At the
other end, Olaf Kolzig of Washington stopped John MacLean's
power-play blast on the fly from the right-wing circle.
</P>
<P>
   Richter was sharp again early in the third period when Andrei
Nikolishin wheeled around Tamer and fired from close range. As
often happens, the other team went down to the other end and
scored.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the goal for the Rangers _ and delighting the many New
York fans in the audience _ was Knuble, who got open in the high
slot and one-timed a slap shot between the legs of Kolzig at the
two-minute mark.
</P>
<P>
   Assisting on the goal were Sundstrom and Manny Malhotra, who
created the chance with a cycling shift that has become
characteristic of their style. Also helping was Samuelsson, who cut
across Kolzig's field of vision.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rangers, this was the second game of a 12-game stretch
in 23 days. They next play the Bruins in Boston on Sunday. Although
both New York and Washington are competing for a playoff berth,
there were vast stretches of empty seats in the building, which
opened last season. In their previous three meetings this season,
the Capitals won twice and the Rangers won once.

EDITORIAL: UNSTABLE AUTOCRACIES IN CENTRAL ASIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, March 5:
</P>
<P>
   A series of car bombs recently exploded at the government's
headquarters in Uzbekistan's capital, Tashkent, killing 16 people.
They narrowly missed the country's leader, Islam Karimov _ a sign
that the stability provided by the dictators of Central Asia and
the Caucasus can be quickly upended.
</P>
<P>
   Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, stability has been the
West's primary goal for these countries. The region borders such
trouble spots as Afghanistan and Iran. It is also sitting on
bountiful oil and gas reserves. While the United States has
criticized the local leaders for their autocratic ways, it has
treated them as partners, on the theory that their rule provides a
stable climate for oil and gas investment. But the attempt on
Karimov, and the failing health of President Heydar Aliyev of
Azerbaijan, are reminders that autocratic rule could give way to
instability when the dictators die.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the leaders in the region have focused all politics
around loyalty to themselves and blocked the development of
political institutions. There are few serious political parties,
parliaments or courts and no mechanisms for a peaceful transition
of power. The most democracy is found in Georgia and Kyrgyzstan,
and the least in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, the most populous
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the leaders encourage potentially volatile clan
politics. Under Soviet rule, Central Asia republics were tightly
controlled by Communist leaders appointed by Moscow _ many of whom
are now their nations' presidents. They once relied on a network of
local state farm and provincial bosses. Today these same men head
territorial mafias that control jobs and government benefits.
Virtually all Central Asia's strongmen favor a particular mafia or
clan _ crucial in countries where such ties determine who gets
rich.
</P>
<P>
   Repression of religion is another practice that could cause
future unrest. In Uzbekistan, the independent practice of Islam is
banned, and President Karimov has closed hundreds of mosques in the
last year. The crackdown on Islam has politicized the expression of
religion and turned it into an outlet for protest against poverty
and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   While all the dictators claim to welcome foreign investment,
most will not institute market reforms or anti-corruption measures
that might stimulate economic growth. Karimov, for example, has
lost foreign investment and International Monetary Fund loans
because he continues to control access to hard currency. He does so
to reward friends by allowing them to buy foreign currency cheaply,
which they can then resell for huge profits. Instead of building
stability through economic growth and the construction of political
institutions, Central Asia's dictators count on smothering dissent.
That kind of artificial, temporary stability often ends in
explosive unrest. &QL;

PROTESTS FROM WOMEN'S GROUPS AFTER U.N. BARS ETHNIC TIBETAN'S TALK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ U.N. officials have prevented an ethnic Tibetan
from addressing the organization's Commission on the Status of
Women, saying this might offend the Chinese delegation and result
in China's opposing the accreditation of some women's groups to the
world organization.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, which occurred on Wednesday, has drawn protests
from women's and human rights groups attending the commission's
annual two-week conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Losang Rabgey, a Canadian citizen of Tibetan origin who
represents an international human rights group called the
Transnational Radical Party, was chosen to address the commission
as one of five delegates on its task force on women's health. Her
topic was to be violence against women in occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, officials from the U.N. Division for the
Advancement of Women said she would not be allowed to speak,
explaining that her name was identifiably Tibetan and that this
might offend the Chinese delegation.
</P>
<P>
   She was also warned that if China was offended, it might oppose
accrediting some women's organizations to the United Nations when
their status comes up for review.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rabgey then asked another scheduled speaker, Krishanti
Dharmaraj of the San Francisco-based Women's Institute for
Leadership Development for Human Rights, to mention her exclusion
during her address.
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. Dharmaraj did so U.N. officials refused to let any of
the three other scheduled speakers take the floor. They also
expressed displeasure with Dr. Joyce Brock, an American physician
and the organizer of the task force on women's health, who had
selected the original five speakers.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. spokeswomen said officials in the Division for the
Advancement for Women insisted that the reason Ms. Rabgey was not
allowed to speak was that they thought her topic was not relevant
to the commission's work.
</P>
<P>
   But Janice Mantell, executive director of the International
Committee of Lawyers for Tibet, said Thursday that it was
``unacceptable that a U.N. body entrusted to promote the human
rights of women cannot hear from a participant because her ethnic
identity is a politically sensitive issue for China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tibetans are a target of China's colonial expansion directly
resulting in human rights violations, including violence against
women,'' Ms. Mantell said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the lawyers committee said, ``Tibetan women are
subjected to systematic violence in the form of forced or coerced
sterilization and abortion, including late-term abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed Brody, of Human Rights Watch, said, ``This kind of
censorship is unfortunately typical of the U.N. bureaucracy's
penchant to cave in at even the suggestion of Chinese
displeasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Denish Fuchs, president of the European Women's Lobby, said,
``We fully support the right to speak of all women, including
Tibetan, and we deplore the fact that this right should have been
denied them.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no comment from the Chinese delegation.

SPORTS COLUMN: JITTERY VAN GUNDY SHOULD DROP THE BOOTCAMP BABBLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By   HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the coach of an 8-5 basketball team ominously
declares that ``the season is slipping away,'' he needs to take
another look at the standings, or put in a reality-check call to
John Calipari.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what Jeff Van Gundy said after the Knicks'
lopsided loss last weekend in Detroit. Obviously, the coach was
responding to his team's lifeless road effort, not its overall
record, but he nonetheless managed to lay the trap he often
complains the critics too often fall into in their all-or-nothing
evaluations of the Knicks. He sounded suspiciously like a fan, or,
worse, a coach who is beginning to fear for his job.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's job could very well be on the line, given the
Yankee-sized payroll underwritten by the cable behemoth that owns
the team. Fair or not _ and I think not, based, in part, on the
excellent work Van Gundy did last season _ the Knicks haven't
advanced beyond the second round for four straight years. In this
truncated, Jordan-less season, it will be harder to explain away
another failed run to the conference final, or beyond. It will be
much easier for the Knicks to make a scapegoat of their coach.
</P>
<P>
   One who works with such expectations looks at the standings, and
can't help but notice the Nascar-like draft of contending playoff
teams. Forget, for the moment, Indiana, Miami and Orlando. Almost a
third of the way through the 50-game schedule, Van Gundy opened the
newspaper Thursday to find his Knicks a half-game behind Allen
Iverson, the one-man offense formerly known as the Philadelphia
76ers.
</P>
<P>
   This regular-season sprint is scary stuff, uncharted territory.
All the more important why Van Gundy _ whose quintessential player,
after all that has been said and spent, is a 36-year-old center
with brittle knees _ must look beyond the standard race for the
highest playoff seeding. His job is to get to the playoffs with the
best playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   Let Pat Riley relentlessly drive his players, risk wearing them
out, for an extra home game that will make no difference when
Alonzo Mourning fouls out, or punches his way out, of the Heat's
next must-win playoff test. Van Gundy beat Riley in the first round
last season without home-court advantage, without even Ewing, yet
he continues to embrace the Riley way as if his former mentor
carried the coaching commandments from the mountain to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Riley always brags that the bigger the game, the shorter his
rotation. It's a matter of trust, he claims. In Miami, Van Gundy
benched Marcus Camby and gave Chris Dudley, the backup center who
makes roughly $7 million a year, 7 minutes of his time. Van Gundy
says he does not believe that 8 or 10 minutes of rest every game
makes a difference for Ewing. This is pure Rileyspeak, boot camp
babble that defies fundamental reason. Ewing was a chronological
revelation in Miami, a statistical marvel.
</P>
<P>
   He was also, after 43 minutes of brutal combat with Mourning and
P.J. Brown, exhausted. No legs, no lift, no energy to drive the
ball to the basket on the last possession of a 1-point game.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, never strong on shot selection, always made enough bad
ones in his peak years to keep his shooting percentage around 50.
He is down around 40 this season, an alarming if understandable
decline. Ewing is formidable under good scoring conditions, but he
is not the athlete he once was. He needs his legs to create the
best opportunity, especially in the mayhem at the end of a game.
The coach's job is to make sure he has them.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell's return in Milwaukee Friday night gives Van
Gundy a chance to restart the season with a broader sense of
purpose. A second unit of Sprewell, Camby, Dudley with Chris Childs
and Charlie Ward would give the Knicks their most athletic,
up-tempo look in years. This cannot be hit or miss, though, a
once-a-week option. Van Gundy must make a commitment to his bench,
the way Larry Bird has with the Indiana Pacers, the conference's
team to beat.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than enough bad or battered teams stumbling
about, playing too many games in too many nights. The Knicks will
get a decent playoff seeding no matter how Van Gundy plays it. He
can afford to tinker, to invest, to give Ewing and Larry Johnson
their rest.
</P>
<P>
   There are no must games until May. Only the foolish and the
desperate would push a player beyond his physical capability in
February or March. Calipari, for one, inexplicably stretched a
hamstrung Sam Cassell in the Nets' first game, and is paying a
punishing price. His season, unlike Van Gundy's, is going, going
gone. &QL;

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Even before Books &AMP; Co. opened at 9 a.m.
Thursday, about a dozen people anxiously waited outside the store
to grab a copy of ``Monica's Story,'' the latest book about the
President Clinton-Monica Lewinsky affair to hit shelves.
</P>
<P>
   By 12:30 p.m., the store had sold all of its 50 copies,
according to Sharon Kelly Roth, director of public relations at
Books &AMP; Co. One customer even purchased four for friends and
relatives, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of people commented that (the book) was part of
history and they wanted to have it in their collection,'' Roth
explained. ``Some were impressed with (Lewinksy's ABC-TV) interview
with Barbara Walters (on Wednesday night) and just wanted more
details. And some wanted to read the book because it had
information in it (Lewinsky) wasn't allowed to discuss on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the former White House intern's immunity agreement,
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr first had to approve the
questions and answers given in the Wednesday special.
</P>
<P>
   Other customers, Roth said, lamented ``that they had had
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Angie Behnfeldt, 40, is tired of the topic. She, like nearly all
of the customers interviewed at Books &AMP; Co. on Thursday evening,
said she didn't watch the TV interview nor does she plan to buy the
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of this is making light of the situation,''
Behnfeldt said. ``It's made her into a star and what she did was
immoral. I just don't have any interest in helping her make money
off of the book. I'm embarrassed for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Lill, 31, said while she doesn't plan to buy the book,
she would ``flip through it'' if she comes across a copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had about enough of it,'' Lill said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with brisk sales of ``Monica's Story,'' first-day receipts
still didn't compare to the sales of other recent hot sellers such
as ``The Starr Report'' or Princess Diana memorabilia at Books &AMP;
Co., Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Starr Report' had larger sales the first day because we
had more copies in stock and because it was all new information,''
Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   The store expects another shipment of 150 copies of ``Monica's
Story'' today, she said.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday afternoon and into the evening, Books &AMP; Co. and
other book stores around the Miami Valley, were inundated with
calls from customers to place yet-to-arrive copies on hold.
</P>
<P>
   The independent Bookfriends sold its three copies on Thursday
but expects another small shipment on Monday, according to co-owner
Jim Latham.
</P>
<P>
   Latham, who said he sold very few of ``The Starr Report,'' said
because very few of his customers inquired about Lewinsky's book,
he didn't bother to order many.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the feeling that most of (my customers) are just tired
of the whole thing,'' he said.

UNITED NATIONS TO COLLECT SUPPORT FOR WORKERS' EX-SPOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speaking on women's issues to an audience that included Hillary
Rodham Clinton, the secretary general of the United Nations, Kofi
Annan, announced a policy change Thursday that is intended to bring
relief to a long-suffering group of women, the ex-wives of United
Nations employees.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, a growing group of former United Nations spouses,
including many in metropolitan New York, have accused the
organization of hypocrisy and callousness because it allowed
employees to avoid paying court-ordered spousal and child support.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, critics estimated that hundreds of women, perhaps
more, have not collected support because the United Nations and its
affiliated organizations have refused for decades to waive their
international immunity from legal process and garnishee the wages
of employees who did not pay.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Annan spoke of the rising worldwide poverty among
women as he announced that the United Nations would begin
garnisheeing wages of recalcitrant employees case by case. He
called the problem of unpaid support ``an issue of moral concern to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It presents us with a duty to set an example,'' he said,
according to a transcript of his speech. The details of the policy
have not been drafted, but United Nations officials said work on
the new rules was to begin Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For years, employers in the United States have had to
immediately comply with garnishment orders or risk being cited for
contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Colt, the deputy chief of the Family Court Division of
the city's Law Department, represents more than a dozen United
Nations ex-spouses and greeted the announcement with skepticism.
She said the case-by-case review could mean long delays in which
the United Nations essentially acted as a court of appeals,
deciding whether to approve support payments. She said the
yet-to-be determined policy must allow for swift action.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Colt, a fierce critic of the United Nations whose
clients have largely been ignored by the organization for decades,
added: ``At least it's public acknowledgment on the part of the
secretary general that there is a problem. I guess that's pretty
major. That's an important admission on the part of the U.N., but I
don't think it's going to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Boernstein, a former United Nations lawyer who has worked
with ex-spouses, said the policy change must be made in ``good
faith,'' but added that she was ``thrilled at any progress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the pressure must continue,'' Ms.
Boernstein said. ``I'm very excited that a small, determined group
of people can make changes.''
</P>
<P>
   International immunity exempts the United Nations and other
international organizations rom legal process in any country. The
immunity was created so that the organization could remain
autonomous from the actions of hostile governments, but the United
Nations has interpreted the immunity broadly and has refused to
recognize any court orders against its employees, including those
for support. This has provided a loophole for employees, most of
them men, to avoid payment.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 100 such ex-spouses are estimated to live in the New
York area, and the number is much larger internationally. One woman
in New York lives in a Salvation Army boarding house because her
ex-husband has refused to pay her. A Westchester County woman has
tried to collect court-ordered support for more than 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Frechette, the deputy secretary general and the United
Nations' highest ranking woman, began pushing for change last
November after an article about the former spouses appeared in The
New York Times. A top aide to Ms. Frechette, Marta Mauras, said the
United Nations will not relinquish its autonomy and stressed that
most employees do comply with support orders. But she said the new
policy is very much needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. needs to become much more sensitive and family
friendly,'' Ms. Mauras said. ``This is an issue that affects staff
members and their families as rates of divorce and separation
increase; this is one way to respond to the needs of families.''

GOP APPROVES 2000 BUDGET PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders agreed Thursday on a blueprint
for a 2000 budget plan that would prohibit Social Security funds
from being raided to pay for tax cuts and keep spending increases
on defense, education and other programs within the limits set two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, hailed the
agreement with his Senate GOP colleagues as a ``historic'' event
that lays out how the government will handle the estimated billions
in budget surpluses that are expected over the next 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The surpluses are largely made up of money from the Social
Security trust fund, which the government has for years tapped for
other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan, which only has the broad parameters of a 2000
spending proposal, must be approved by Republican members of
Congress before they can negotiate with the administration on a
final budget.
</P>
<P>
   But it marks the first time since Clinton outlined his own
budget proposal in January that Republicans have responded with
definitive proposals of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the plan were still sketchy Thursday evening. But the
agreement reached between Kasich and Senate Budget Committee
Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., calls for a small tax cut beginning
next year, a military pay increase and increased spending in a
number of education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Its central provision, however, calls for using annual Social
Security surpluses to help pay down the national debt, instead of
being diverted to offset tax cuts and pay for other programs.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to use most of the surpluses to pay down the
national debt was designed to rob Democrats of their complaint that
Republicans want to use Social Security money to pay for tax cuts
to the rich.
</P>
<P>
   While the Republican proposal mirrors Clinton's plan to use most
of the budget surpluses to shore up Social Security by paying down
the debt, it does not include setting aside surpluses for Medicare
and other programs, which Clinton and the Democrats would like to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said the Republican
proposal was ``two thirds of the way there,'' but was not likely to
pass Congress unless it helps to keep the Medicare program solvent
beyond 2010, when it is expected to run out of money.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici insisted, however, that he wants to protect most of the
projected surpluses for the Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to lock up every penny of the Social Security
trust fund system for our nation's elderly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he told reporters that he would consider setting aside money
for Medicare if it can be reformed to prevent fraud and waste.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici and Kasich said the Republican plan calls for phased-in
tax cuts beginning next year and continuing through 2009, but it is
unclear whether they will take the form of across-the-board cuts or
targeted relief as Clinton and some Republicans have sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are sending too much money to this town, and we want
to send it back,'' said Kasich, who plans to seek the Republican
presidential nomination in 2000.

JOHNSON: VIZCAINO CAN BE HANDYMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said he
hasn't received a serious call from another team interested in
acquiring Jose Vizcaino lately. If that call comes, manager Davey
Johnson has an idea: decline it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the expected happens, which is Mark Grudzielanek beating
out Vizcaino for the starting job at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to keep both of them, regardless of who's (starting)
there,'' Johnson said. ``If I had my druthers, I'd like to keep
both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   There is strong speculation that Vizcaino could be traded before
the Dodgers leave Dodgertown, but his versatility is something
Johnson likes. In today's Grapefruit League opener against the St.
Louis Cardinals, Vizcaino will start at second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (keeping both players) is an option, but we have to
see how it plays out,'' Malone said. ``That gives us security. If
someone goes down, or if (Adrian) Beltre struggles (at third), you
have a veteran guy who can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino started at shortstop for the Dodgers on opening day
last season but missed the last three months of the season with an
ankle injury, though he was reinstated for the Dodgers' final 17
games. He started 65 games at shortstop and hit .262 with 29 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't hesitate to put him in if he wasn't the every-day
shortstop; 20 to 30 games at shortstop, a bunch at second and a
bunch at third,'' Johnson said. ``Not knowing nothing from nothing
. . . Vizcaino would be the most valuable player, (because he's)
able to play different positions for me. I like his glove and I
like his versatility with the bat. To me, he's more valuable than
my everyday guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm not going to do is make Grudzielanek into a utility
player.''
</P>
<P>
   So if Grudzielanek remains with the Dodgers, it leaves Vizcaino
as the backup middle infielder _ a curse brought on by his
versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be here, but I don't know what's going to happen,''
said Vizcaino, who was then asked whether he'd be happy with the
Dodgers as a utility infielder. ``I can't answer that question now
because I don't know if I'll feel the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Scouting the Dodgers: Not only is there talk of Vizcaino
being traded, but one of the six starting pitchers figures to have
a new address by the end of the month. It's why, as of late
Thursday, 18 scouts were expected at today's game against the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of nice to know we have some quality players other
clubs are interested in,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ticket talk: Team officials at Dodgertown were excited to
hear that a few thousand people showed up at Dodger Stadium on
Thursday morning to purchase single-game tickets for this season.
</P>
<P>
   There are approximately 1,000 tickets left for the opener
against Arizona on April 5.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only that enthusiasm carried over to Vero Beach for
Grapefruit League play. About 400 reserved tickets are available
for today's Grapefruit League opener against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been bothered since the work stoppage (in 1994),''
Dodgers president and CEO Bob Graziano said. ``We used to sell out
a lot of games. Since '94, our attendance has not been strong in
Vero Beach, so I am bothered by the fact (today) is not sold out. .
. . I'd like to see significant support from the fans in Vero
Beach, but I am very happy about the number of fans to show up at
Dodger Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Grapefruit League lineup: Right-hander Ismael Valdes is
slated to start today's game and pitch the first two innings for
the Dodgers and right-hander Dave Mlicki is supposed to pitch the
third and fourth innings, pitching coach Charlie Hough said.
</P>
<P>
   Hough said left-handers Chris Haney and Pedro Borbon and
righties Doug Bochtler and Alan Mills will also pitch.
</P>
<P>
   As for the lineup, not too many regulars are slated to play.
Johnson said the starting lineup will be Devon White (center
field), Vizcaino (second base), Raul Mondesi (right field), Eric
Karros (first base), Todd Hollandsworth (left field), Grudzielanek
(shortstop), Beltre (third base) and Paul LoDuca (catcher).

AD COLUMN: A CAMPAIGN FOR MILLER LITE GOES BACK TO BASICS  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Minn., Texas, N.Y.)  (js) 
 BY STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miller Brewing Co. is making an abrupt about-face by
unceremoniously ending a campaign for the flagging Miller Lite beer
brand. The campaign generated contentious debate over its
unconventional content, which attempted to appeal to younger
consumers with offbeat entertainment rather than product pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beer did not play a role in the advertising,'' Jack
Rooney, vice president for marketing at Miller in Milwaukee, said
Thursday, ``and that was its fundamental weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   The replacement campaign for Miller Lite _ still Miller's
largest brand despite sales softness _ begins Friday with
commercials taking a more traditional, broadly directed and
product-oriented approach.
</P>
<P>
   In the booming light beer market, where Miller Lite now trails
the Bud Light brew sold by Anheuser-Busch, ``we can make Miller
Lite No. 1 again,'' Rooney declared, ``one day at a time, one step
at a time, based on a product proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new spots evoke the brand's popular, product-fixated
``debate'' campaign of the 1970s and 1980s, when celebrities
pretended to argue over whether they liked Miller Lite because it
``tastes great'' or because it was ``less filling.'' The overhauled
campaign, centered on contemporary celebrities good-naturedly
debating the ingredients and drinkability of Miller Lite, carries
the theme ``The great taste of a true Pilsner beer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can capture that again,'' Rooney said, referring to the
spirit and success of the original campaign, ``then the brand will
grow again.'' Sales last year fell about 2 percent from 1997, when
they rose modestly; by comparison, Bud Light has racked up
double-digit percentage sales gains.
</P>
<P>
   The new Miller Lite TV and radio commercials, print and Internet
ads and posters are being produced by Fallon McElligott in
Minneapolis, the same shop that created the quirky ``Miller time''
campaign introduced in 1997 by a fictitious adman named Dick. But
the new ads bear no resemblance to the old, which were castigated
for straying from marketing fundamentals in trying to woo ad-weary
members of Generation X with wacky animals, odd characters and
bathroom humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it did very much to sell beer,'' said Bob Keane,
editorial director at Adams Media Beverage Group in New York, part
of Adams Business Media Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking the humor tack they did has not brought back the
younger consumer,'' he added. ``Talking about the brewing process
and the quality of the product seems like a good idea because
that's been missing from the light beer category.''
</P>
<P>
   The sudden shift in campaigns is indicative of the midcourse
corrections that have grown increasingly common as advertisers try
to respond more quickly to faster-changing consumer behavior.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Pepsi-Cola Co. unit of Pepsico Inc. stopped
using the theme ``Generation next'' to promote the Pepsi-Cola brand
after complaints that it was too diffused and youth-oriented. A
replacement, ``The joy of cola,'' was introduced to bottlers
Thursday night and will start nationally on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned one big lesson'' from the bizarre ``Miller time''
campaign, Rooney said, speaking in a telephone interview from
Nashville, where Miller, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., was meeting
with its wholesalers and sales force.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're advertising a product, you ought to give the
consumer a reason to choose that product,'' Rooney said. ``If you
can entertain at the same time, that's great.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign probably could be characterized as a bit more
old school,'' he added. ``And that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Miller time'' campaign was the first produced for Miller
Lite by Fallon McElligott, which has handled the creative portion
of the brand's account, with billings estimated at $150 million,
since December 1996. The agency presented its replacement to Miller
executives as part of a review that ended in January with Fallon
McElligott fighting off three other finalists to retain the
high-profile assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the brand now has a really solid proposition,'' Rooney
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new spots depict pairs of 1990s celebrities in bars, engaged
in light-hearted banter over why Miller Lite ``tastes great'': Is
it ``the choice hops'' or because ``it's so smooth''?
</P>
<P>
   (``Less filling'' is missing, Rooney said, because it has become
``a generic attribute.'')
</P>
<P>
   The pairs include the model Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and the
sportswriter Rick Reilly; the former baseball players Robin Yount
and George Brett; the former relief pitchers Lee Smith and Mitch
Williams, and the auto racers Bobby Rahal and Don Prudhomme.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much a current rendition of those wonderful
commercials of the '70s and '80s,'' said Michael Bellas, chairman
of Beverage Marketing Corp. in New York, which Miller ``has never
been able to really follow up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Miller has to stabilize Lite,'' he added, ``and this is
another attempt to do that. Talking about quality and product
attributes may be what's needed at this time because that's become
far more important to beer drinkers since the '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney agreed, saying: ``Beers with what I would call more
obvious product differences have made the average drinker a little
more beer literate. We used to say Miller Lite was `a fine Pilsner
beer'; you build on what you have.'' That is underscored in four
15-second commercials that will complement the celebrity spots;
focused solely on attributes like flavor, smoothness and
ingredients.

<P>
   There are also Spanish-language versions of the celebrity spots,
created by Square One in Dallas and its Hispanic unit, Uno
Communicaciones. They feature pairs of actors (Erik Estrada and
Kate del Castillo), wrestlers (Hiji del Sol and Atlantis) and
former athletes (Tony Perez and Edward Figueroa).

   Don Coleman Advertising in Detroit, recently named to handle ads
aimed at black consumers, will also create spots for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Pepsi-Cola, its revamped campaign will introduce the
``Joy of cola'' theme by playing up such characteristic brand
elements as celebrities, music and humor. Like Miller Lite,
Pepsi-Cola is seeking to appeal to a broader audience than the
Generation X target of ``Generation next.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign promises to offer something for everyone,'' said
Ted Sann, co-chief executive and chief creative officer at the
Pepsi-Cola agency, BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit
of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   The first three spots in ``The joy of cola'' campaign will
feature the voices of Marlon Brando, Aretha Franklin and Isaac
Hayes. The voices will emanate from Hallie Eisenberg, a girl
featured in a recent commercial in which she ``spoke'' in the voice
of the actor Joe Pesci, warning a counterman at a diner not to
serve her a Coca-Cola.  &QL;
